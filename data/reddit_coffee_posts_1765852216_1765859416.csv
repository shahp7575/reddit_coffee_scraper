I have noticed when we are at home (his place we don't live together) things are great most of the time. We laugh, joke around etc. But whenever we go out it's like a disaster always happens. The other day I we planned a sleepover at his, which was fine. we were eating dinner and i couldn't finish my food and he took the plate back to the kitchen. I allways offer to wash up but he never lets me and tells me to relax. the food was just sitting on the kitchen bench up until the morning. once he saw it i dont know what got him so agitated he slammed the plate into the sink and started saying things like the women in my family usually always clean up etc. I completely forgot about my plate i would have thrown it out. that made me jump and i almost cried. that morning we planned to go to the beach. he was having his usual road rage on the drive there. we were having a good time at the beach for an hour when he expressed that wed go home soon, i told him that we rarely go together and if we could stay for a little longer 45min max to which he agreed. i could see he was getting over it, i got my stuff ready to leave but then some groups were coming to sit near us and he got agitated again and moved so i followed him. i told him lets go home, he kept saying no you want to be here we will stay and obviously i was just ready to go home at that point. so we start walking up the beach my feet are burning from hot sand so i tell him im going to dip my feet in the water and he says ok and he keeps walking. long story short i walked all the way from the beach to our car spot by myself, he was metres ahead of me and didn't look back once even though he says he did and he couldn't see me. he left me there. as i got closer to our parking spot i could see him pulling out and driving off, he says because a car was waiting for his spot. i called him expressing my frustuation and hes shouting on the phone saying walk back im here etc. i get into the car and at this point i was already crying so much.

he was shouting at me in the car driving home, telling me he hates going to the beach with me, he did not believe me that my feet were burning from the sun and i was taking too long to get to the car. in frustuation i shouted loudly to defend myself and he lost is the way he scram at me was like a demon he threatened to even crash the car.  hes screaming to pack my stuff and leave, as im doing that and i leave he stops me at the door and says no come back dont leave like this then he starts saying hes a terrible person he cant control his emotions etc. apologising and begging for forgiveness.

 he ruined my day and he ruins most days out. It's always the days where i want to do something that i enjoy. i never complain doing activities he likes but as soon as its what i enjoy and want to share with him the day is ruined. When its going to places to eat or for coffee its always where he wants to go whats most convenient for him, or what beach is most convenient for him. I feel so numb towards him this is the second time hes left me like that at a place, walked so far ahead of me because of his anger. 

  
so in summary some of the red flags ive come to notice and have probably ignored in the past 

road rage

always angry at the world, at the government 

slamming things when looking for it, doors, cupboards etc. 

slamming dishes 

calling me names (too many to say)

threatening to crash the car while im a passenger 

if i type anymore i'm just going to cry again. this is eating me up. i do love him, i think i loved the person he once was when we first started dating but now i just see him as an angry man. He's my first boyfriend and i am worried if i end this relationship i'm just going to end up in another similar one, or honestly end up lonely which i have experienced majority of my life. He's great with his words, romantic, says all the right things, compliments me, we have chemistry, amazing intimacy and emotionally i did feel fulfilled. now i just feel sort of scared and anxious. i don't know how to approach this or what to do.

The milk steaming wand is however looking quite worn down, after 20 years of cleaning after frothing the polished surface is gone and you can now see the copper or whatever its made of. 

Question is, is this just an eyesore but still functionable, or could there be any toxins or chemicals etc that come off into the milk when using it? She loves her machine and doesn't want to learn a new one, so I tight I'd ask some experts if there's any danger to her health.

I wanted to have a test run for the two weeks before winter break, and I have limited savings. My professional job that I do at nights is paying the bills until I make decent money at the diner. 

I’m having a major issue, and I need some advice on how to handle it. The man I’m renting the space from works in and owns the building and he passes by the diner multiple times a day to tell me to change the menu prices, add items to the menu, change the menu, open longer and different hours, and to give certain people discounts. He has offered To give me 2-3 months free rent until we get off the ground (one or two months free rent in some areas is normal where I live, which is outside of the U.S.). Having a diner near his place of business also helps his business, since folks have a place to grab a quick bite to eat or coffee. 

My question is, how can I clarify to him that while I appreciate his support, I don’t need his advice? He isn’t the only one who gives a LOT of advice, but I’ve told him no and he just gets exasperated with me and says I’m closed minded.

What do you do with this knowledge?","You are now aware that you can predict the future, using some unusual divination method (ie not any ""standard"" divination method, like tea leaves, tarot cards, or palm reading).  You aren't sure exactly how, but you instinctively know it will be one of 3 methods that you describe to me (eg. reading the splatter of a squashed roach, interpretation of the residue left by instant ramen, gazing into a turned off smartphone)

I will tell you which method actually works for you.

Whatever method it is, it rarely if ever gives you specific details, but it will give you (or your client, if you read someone else) enough of the gist of a situation to help you make the right choice about 95% of the time in terms of general life advice (eg dating, job hunting, housing), and increase the odds of a primarily financial decision (eg buying stocks) working out by about 10%.

For example, you could tell something like ""you will meet a tall woman with red hair in a coffee shop; ask her out, you'll like the results"" or ""Don't bother going to that interview today, the company is terrible"".  Yes, you are getting all of that information from bug splatter, or ramen dust, or whatever.

What 3 methods are you trying, and once you figure out what works, how are you using your new powers?  Any other thoughts?

Keep in mind, you have to actually do the thing to get the results.  If you analyze roach splatter, you can't tell the future without killing a roach (or having your client do so).

I’m a 40M (Polish-Italian, Canadian from SF Bay Area) living in Koto-ku and working in the local Tech/IT industry and looking to meet people who’d be up for occasional workouts, especially endurance-focused training.

A bit about my training right now:

Run

\- Mostly Z1/Z2

\- 6:30 / km pace

\- Usually 60–90 min (happy to go shorter or longer)

\- Finally starting to see improvements. Doing more regular tempo work

Bike

\- Indoor on a Wahoo Kickr

\- Regular Peloton app user (Matt W is my hero)

Swim

\- 2:00 / 100m LCM

\- Mostly at Tokyo Metropolitan Gym

Lift

\- 4× / week

\- Powerlifting-style (bench / squat / DL)

\- Plus bodyweight (weighted chins & dips)

I usually train 2–3 sessions a day, 6 days a week, so I’m pretty flexible on timing.

Yes, the heavy lifting is probably slowing endurance progress… but shōganai, I’m enjoying it 😅

Goals:

\- Either IM Japan, IM California, or IM Malaysia in the next 1–2 years

\- Currently cutting weight (191cm / \~215 lb → aiming for \~180 lb) which is influencing my training goals 

If this lines up with where you’re at and you’d be interested in training together sometimes, feel free to DM me.

Bonus: I’m also big into coffee ☕ and a train otaku 🚆, so happy to chat about that too.",1,1765858919.0,tokyosocial,0,1.0,False

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

They set the table right on the sand. Not a fancy table. Two planks on milk crates, a patched cloth weighted with smooth stones from the shore. Someone had brought a brass menorah wrapped in a scarf. Someone else brought a chipped ceramic one with a crooked shin. Both got lit. Both counted.

This was how Qarsherskiyan Jews did Chanukah. Outdoors when they could. Near water when possible. The lake mattered. Water remembered things people forgot.

The kids ran ahead with sparklers, tracing crooked stars in the dark. An aunt shouted at them to watch the reeds. Alligators lived here. So did history. You could respect both at the same time.

Oil hissed in a skillet balanced over a small burner. Latkes went in, thin and ragged, grated potato mixed with cassava and onion because that was what was around. Someone salted them with smoked fish salt from a cousin up the coast. Someone else drizzled honey infused with wild pennyroyal, arguing cheerfully that sugar was sugar and the miracle did not check your pantry.

A grandfather told the old story but sideways. Not kings and armies. He talked about hiding light. About keeping a flame alive when the law said you should not. About people who prayed in whispers and cooked fast and moved when the night birds went quiet. Everyone knew he was talking about more than Antiochus. Everyone nodded.

They sang Ma’oz Tzur with a lilt that bent the melody south. A drum came out. A fiddle followed. Yiddish braided with English and a few words that only the elders still used, river words, swamp words, words for kin that did not translate cleanly. The sound drifted across the lake. It did not ask permission.

Between blessings, a woman passed out fried catfish dusted with cornmeal and cumin. Another poured strong coffee sweetened with date syrup. Someone mentioned ancestors who once kept Chanukah in places like this, near marsh and palmetto, lighting lamps low so they would not be seen. Someone else said we are seen now. Someone corrected them gently. We choose when.

When the eighth candle burned down, they did not rush to pack up. They watched the reflections tremble on the water. Eight flames multiplied into dozens, then hundreds, until it looked like the lake itself had learned the story and was telling it back.

A boy asked why they came here every year. His mother wiped grease from his chin and said because the miracle is not just oil. It is finding a place that holds you. It is keeping light with your people. It is knowing where you stand.

The candles went out one by one. The night stayed warm. The lake kept its quiet. And the shore remembered them, as shores do, ready for next year.",2,1765858599.0,Qarsherskiyans,0,1.0,False

It uprooted my life, but it brought my mum and I closer together. Years later, when she bought a house, I happily moved in as a paying tenant! And am currently living with her. 

My brother chose to stay with Dad and, over the years, deliberately cut us off. There were no replies to calls, texts, or emails for 13 years. No matter how much we tried. The last real contact we had, he stole about $1,000 from the family and that was it... 

Two months ago, out of the blue, he called Mom. He sounded guilty, nervous, and stammering. Turns out he only reached out because he needed something: a place to live. But it illustrated to me how easy it is for my brother to reach out (when he wants something). His antisocial behavior had burned bridges with friends and roommates, so he was moving across the country to crash with us (his estranged family).

Mom couldn’t say no to her son, so now he’s here.

This morning, on my rare day off (with Mom at work), her boyfriend (who doesn’t live here or pay rent) let himself in at 11:30 AM to make coffee and a sandwich, tying up the kitchen for half an hour.

As soon as he left, my jobless brother emerged and spent three full hours (noon to 3 PM) monopolizing the kitchen to meal-prep a huge batch of burritos for himself.

This keeps happening. Every time I have a day off, the kitchen becomes unavailable for hours. It’s driving me crazy.

AITA for being upset about this? Is this unreasonable of me?

Please be honest and let me know because I don't know what to do. ",2,1765858592.0,AmItheButtface,1,1.0,False

Hello everyone,

My husband (28M) and I (27F) have been in Canada for about 3 years now, and while we're loving it here, we've realized our social circle is pretty small. We're looking to meet other couples or individuals who might be in a similar situation.

We're open to all sorts of activities, whether it's grabbing coffee, trying out new restaurants, exploring the city, board game nights, or just casual hangouts. We're friendly, laid-back, and excited to make some new connections.

What we envision:
- Amazing long term friendships.
- Friends turned into family.
- Great outings - we are not high on spending and like to keep it simple and not extravagant.
- Movie nights, sleepovers, picnics, board games, road trips, celebrating shit together is definitely our thing.
- Reliable friends for a lifetime.

I know these sound far fetched but with mutual outlooks and a little bit of effort, it’s definitely possible!

Also, if u are here to ghost please do not reach out to this post!

Looking forward to hopefully meeting some amazing people to call friends!",1,1765858588.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,1,1.0,False

1pnslai,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1pnslai/asm_role_timeline/,ASM role timeline,"Hey there! Looking for some help and insight on the ASM role. 

I accepted the ASM position 8 months ago as of today. I trained for six weeks out of the district … then returned to be home store where I continued to develop. I was under the impression that I would be in this position for 6 months to 1 year (that’s always what my DM has spoke about). I am aware that at the 6 month mark, if I feel confident, that I am eligible to apply for a SM role (Coffeehouse Leader).

Without any explanation, my question is: Is there a duration where I would be forced to apply as a coffee house leader? Could I be forced to apply for a coffee house leader before the one year mark? Especially if I don’t feel confident enough yet …

Here’s the explanation.  

About a month ago, I would say at my 7th month mark, I had a conversation with my DM. It pretty much felt like a quiz to see if I was ready to take on the SM position. I DO FEEL CONFIDENT. But I explained to her I wanted to give myself more time to see if a SM position was posted in another state. For reference, I’ve been looking to move. I’m 24 and still live at home and honestly this was my plan from the beginning of applying for the ASM role. She explained to me that there could be roles opening in the district or the surrounding district and she was just preparing to bring me up at the partner planning meeting. Nothing was certain but she told me to give it some thought and be prepared for anything. 

Last week we had our monthly meeting. She announced at this monthly huddle that a manager in my district resigned. Funny story, it’s my home store that I was originally hired at and transferred out of for many reasons. After everybody left the monthly huddle, we spoke separately and she asked if I would be interested in taking on that role. I told her I needed some time to think about it. 

Today, my DM and I spoke and she asked me how I was feeling. I told here “In all transparency, I’m not opposed to the idea but I feel like it’s only fair to me that I give myself until the closer to one year mark to see if there was a job posting in the state I wanted.” She kinda took that and her first response was “Well if the timing isn’t right you could always look into demoting and reapplying.” AND THAT COMPLETELY THREW ME OFF GUARD.  

In my district, there’s four ASM’s. Two on a LOA and one who was promoted before me. Yet, I’m the only one being asked to apply as far I know. The conversation was really unsettling and she asked for a time frame and I told her February/March since March 24th would be my one year in the ASM role. 

I couldn’t find a definite answer with the questions I asked earlier so I opened a case with Partner Resources - not sure if that was smart but the question in the case was pretty much could I be forced to apply for a SM role if I felt I wasn’t ready.

Again, I’m really just looking for insight and any helpful advice to my questions earlier. I don’t want to be forced into a store I don’t want to be at forever since coffee house leaders now have to be in their retail role for three years.

Would you keep reading? I took some advice from this sub and applied it. I have several chapters that I plan on rewriting, so any advice is appreciated. Thank you guys!","Something was crawling under his skin—or at least he hoped so.

If Scott pressed hard enough, he could feel it sleeping within the nape of his neck. At five years old, he began rubbing it every hour in an attempt to wake it.

What was once a child’s pitiful attempt at resuscitation was now a thirty-year-old man’s most depressing habit. All vices are reminders of some kind. Scott’s was hope, and he sure didn’t look like it was.

Thin lines of red were still visible at the base of Scott’s fingernails. Days had passed since he was shot, but a new job was always waiting on the horizon. He never bled for long.

Scott tightened his grip on the wheel.

Each bump in the road made the AC jitter under the hood—buzzing like a wasp caught in a vacuum hose. Lush evergreens and bare deciduous trees stood tall on either side, guiding traffic further into the mountains. Gray skies hung above with clouds clinging to the snowy peaks.

A cold, dense humidity lingered in the cab. It was enough to quench his thirst if he inhaled a hundred times. Scott kept checking the mud-spattered mirrors; front, back, side to side, even the blind spots.

Today’s steed, an unsuspecting black truck with a shell, was one of many vehicles on Highway 2. Every tire plowed through old puddles and kicked up a dark mist that spattered across his windshield. Scott squinted as the wipers flew by, giving him a moment of clarity before the next splash.

His eyes drifted down to the scuffed-up dashboard where the radio displayed a time in sickly green—3:00 P.M.

“Making good time,” Scott mumbled, his voice gruff yet quiet. “They're really haulin’ it, huh?”

Nothing. She must be reading.

Scott rolled his shoulders back with a sigh, tapping a forefinger against the steering wheel. The gas and brake played tug of war as the mountain traffic wound through sharp turns.

His hand went up to his neck, only noticing because it was the one he was tapping with.

“...Red.” He frowned as he put his hand back on the wheel. “Come on, don't leave me hanging.”

**“I'm multitasking.”**

Scott snorted, a brief smirk pulling his cheeks back. He reached over to the empty passenger seat and grabbed a thermos rolling around—the only real cup holder being occupied by a loaded pistol—and cracked it open with one hand.

**“Are you bored?”**

“I'm tired.” He grunted and took a swig of black coffee, which had long gone cold. “Sun's setting soon—humor me for a bit.”

**“Does that mean I can hit you with one-tenth percent?”**

“Oh, no, no. Please don't. Only you'd find that funny.” Scott chuckled as he rechecked the rearview mirror to see headlights blurred by the mist. Same license plates as before, and before that, and even before that. His smile melted away as he closed the thermos and tossed it back onto the seat.

A typical divider with a tiny window separated the cab and shell, the latter of which was stuffed to the gills with large, black duffel bags. Scott had memorized the contents of each one—canned food, water bottles, camping gear, winter coats, towels, children’s clothes, toys, burner phones, bogus license plates, the list went on.

Before turning back to the road, Scott’s eyes lingered on the backseat for a moment. Every seat was dark gray, sparse, and tidy in contrast to the clutter in the back. 

A small booster chair was strapped into the passenger-side backseat. It was empty.

**“Uh oh.”**

Red muttered just as one of the vehicles broke free from the traffic up ahead. Scott snapped to attention, glaring at a plain white van as it turned off Highway 2, bouncing over a set of railroad tracks on its way down an intersecting street. One man up front. No turn signal.

Scott cursed and engaged his own blinker, tapping the brakes before committing to the turn—knuckles pale on the wheel. Everything in the cab rattled and swung with the inertia as his wheels went over the same tracks. Scott cringed as his thermos rolled right off the seat and clattered onto the passenger side floor.

Trees crowded the gray sky as telephone poles wove black wires alongside the canopy. This tight road was straight and empty—except for the van—with a speed limit sign glaring at them as they passed; the highway had blessed him with a solid sixty, which had now been dragged down to a thirty-five.

Begrudgingly, Scott coasted along with his foot off the gas, squinting as the van disappeared into the fog. They hadn’t slowed down.

**“There’s an airport—Never mind, they just passed it.”**

Scott huffed with a shake of his head. “You think WASH would waste money on a flight?”

**“No, but they don’t permit bathroom breaks either.”**

Just as the van left his sight, a special sign with its own rain cover appeared. It stood red against the muggy weather. A goofy bear-goat-animal-thing, he couldn't tell what, was painted on—pointing at the white and black words.

*Rocky Says:*

*Welcome to SKYKOMISH*

*GREAT NORTHERN TOWN*

Some color returned to his knuckles. “...Thanks, Rocky,” It came out as a whisper.

Skykomish was a rural suburbia, if you could even call it that. Surrounded by mountains, interlaced with train tracks, and the occasional black web of telephone lines. Every humble home was a different color, with the only similarity being the lack of fences and abundance of gravel driveways.

**“Turn right at 5th street—they're turning back onto Highway 2. Going fast.”**

“Why? Did they stop for donuts?” Scott chewed the inside of his cheek, glancing at the occasional truck in the opposite lane. “...Is it me?”

**“No, you're too far away, it just crossed the bridge. Their driving is erratic.”**

Scott rounded the corner, bouncing over more train tracks as he scanned every vintage building that he rolled by. One school, one library, one laundromat, one of everything else a small town needed.

 “Where's the bridge—oh.” Scott's voice ended in a grunt as a bluish-gray bridge suddenly emerged from the fog. “Can't see a thing out here.”

**“Welcome to Washington.”**

Highway 2 was just as they left it. Minutes passed, his finger tapping faster and faster. They were now in a sparse phase of traffic, left to drive alone with the van having vanished into the fog again.

**“They’re speeding.”**

Scott clicked his tongue and took his foot off the gas. “This isn't adding up. All they did was loop around. Are you *sure* we're clear?”

**“You’d be dead by now. No drone activity within range. They're still en route to the disposal site.”**

“...You know, we could invest in drones, too.”

**“Careful, it's swerving—”**

Red's voice cut off, choking on her words.

Scott sat upright, eyes wide. “Red?”

Silence.

“Red. What happened?” Blood roared in his ears.

**“...Oh, God.”**

Scott frowned hard. “Tell me. Fast.”

**“It went off the road.”**

The man's knuckles went bone-white as a violent shudder ran up his spine. He slammed his foot on the gas.

**“Don't speed…”**

Red's voice trailed off as the truck rattled down the road.

Fifteen seconds passed before he caught up, far too long. The brake slammed down the moment he saw the aftermath. All four tires squealed in protest as the truck lurched to a stop on the shoulder of the road.

Part of the guardrails had been ripped away, now bent and hanging off at awkward angles. There were no skid marks on the pavement. Scott parked and threw the door open. He holstered his pistol and approached, occasionally glancing up and down the now-empty road before peeking over the gaping edge.

It was steep and rocky with the occasional bush, all of which had been trampled by the wheels of the white van. Having stopped a dozen yards down, its hood and cab were flattened against a thick tree with only the back half remaining somewhat intact. White smoke rose from the front before dispersing into the dense fog.

Both of the double doors in the back were hanging open. Scott hesitated; something red was smeared across them—dripping down the interior side in long, eerie streaks.

From the road, two people were visible inside the cargo bay. Neither were moving—their features obscured by the shadows and fog that engulfed them. “They're still inside… with the blood spatter.” Scott crossed his arms with a stern frown on his face. “So the doors were closed during the crash.” He squinted hard; there was a large object sitting behind them. Sitting askew in the cargo bay—rectangular, tipped over, its details lost due to the distance.

**“Cage. Empty. It crushed those two on impact.”**

“...Something tells me they were already dead by then.”

The only source of light within was a hole that had been punched through the metal divider—straight into the cab. Fading daylight streaked through the wrecked windshield in dim, blurred rays.

All Scott could discern was that the hole was a perfect circle. Too large to be from a bullet. Right where the driver's head would have been on the other side.

He tensed up—a bead of sweat rolling down his back—and scanned the nearby trees. So much dirt and debris had been kicked up that the surrounding earth was in chaos. He was about to descend when Red cut in.

**“I hear them. Something is heading west through the wilderness.**

Scott snapped to attention. “Back towards Skykomish?”

**“Yes—they just left my audible range.”**

“Alright.” Scott braced one of his hands on the edge of the cliff, beginning to step down the slope. “Keep tabs on police, I'm going in—”

Her voice was sharp.

**“—Drone activity in the east.”**

He froze and looked up into the gray sky. “What? Already?”

**“They're coming your way—RF confirmed.”**

Every hair on his neck raised high. Scott clamped a sweaty palm down onto it. “Son of a… How?”

**“I don’t know, they just entered my range.”**

The pavement trembled as a car passed behind him. Scott turned to watch it leave before looking the other way to see more headlights gleaming through the fog.

“On the 2nd, of all places.” He cast a final look down the hill before jogging back to the truck. “Red, we need to go hunting.”

**“On it.”**

“Damn, so much for investigating.” Scott huffed as he closed the truck door and started the engine. It and the AC sputtered to life. He pulled back onto the road, cranking the radio up. “Plan B, then.""

As he flipped through the channels, Red continued.

**“Expect a confrontation—they should have gotten an alert by now.”**

Scott nodded, glancing down at his pistol before glaring ahead.

For a moment, that composure of hers faltered.

**“Scott… The recovery team will find my bug.”**

He gripped the wheel. “It's a race, then.”",1,1765858458.0,writers,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Was grabbing coffee in the Mission yesterday and the new cafe on 24th has palm scanning for payments. Not even a card reader anymore, just wave your hand. Gym in SOMA scans your face to check you in. That new dispensary on Haight uses iris verification. Even saw Whole Foods testing ""just walk out"" tech that tracks you through the store.

Like when did we collectively agree to this? I moved here 3 years ago and people still used cards. Now my roommate literally doesn't carry a wallet anymore because ""everything's biometric.""

The tech bro in me thinks it's convenient af. The privacy-conscious person in me is like... are we sure about this?

Here's what's tripping me out: SF always gets the pilot programs first. Face ID, then airport Clear lanes, now there's companies setting up iris verification spots around the city (saw one downtown near the Salesforce Tower). They pitch it as ""prove you're human in the AI age"" which honestly isn't wrong given how insane bots have gotten.

But here's my question - where does this end? In 5 years will I need to scan my eyeball just to ride MUNI? Will my landlord require biometric verification to enter my own building? (Honestly wouldn't surprise me with SF rent prices, they'd probably charge extra for ""premium security features"")

I get that SF is the tech capital and we're supposed to embrace innovation, but feels like we're speedrunning toward a future where your physical body IS your password for literally everything. And once that infrastructure exists citywide, there's no putting that genie back in the bottle.

On one hand - no more fumbling for keys, cards, or passwords. On the other hand - every coffee shop, gym, and corner store has a record of my biometric data? That's a lot of trust in a city where half the startups fold within 18 months.

Anyone else feel like we're living in the beta version of whatever the rest of the country gets in 10 years? Or am I just being paranoid and should embrace our biometric overlords?",20,1765858321.0,sanfrancisco,13,0.73,False

           During my summer holiday came across a small but insightful gap in the restaurant space and Thought why not start a magazine, Nothing fancy pancy , Just a simple , Unique and interesting Gen - Z magazine. I have seen that many students and employees in Bangalore crave for some good food in a cozy place with a affordable menu , But they don't want to go to the same restaurant again and again eat the same style of food .They want to explore and enjoy all types of cuisines across the beautiful bangalore. 

              I mainly intend to bring out the OG cozy vibes of The true Bangalore like it was back in the 2000s , The Small samosa shops near South end to the filter coffee of tazaa Thindi and the beautiful sights of KR Market and it's cute dogs . 

             I don't intend to make a lot of money by selling or starting this small project, on the contrary I'm thinking of giving away this magazine for free and maybe make the money back by partnering with restaurant and also Mainly cloud kitchen, as they struggle to the attention of customers with no physical restaurant to showcase themselves.And This can inturn probably be interesting for the times when the weather outside in Bangalore is like the way it is and people would want to sit at the comfort of their house and Enjoy the food . 
          
            I want to know how you guys feel about this , and if you are looking to help me out ( by design , photography, marketing , accounting or nothing for that matter ),and be a partner in this small project that would be great too , You can message me your opinions and your ideas ☺️",2,1765858174.0,Bangalorestartups,0,1.0,False

He approached me and shoot a shot to get my IG. Then we’ve talked, we’ve dated for how many days. Btw, He’s a Filipino but he’s living in US and American Citizen because of his work. Then Nov 1 we decided to have a coffee in Megamall, but hindi daw siya nag cocoffee so do I. Since matcha lover ako I told him to try it and nagustuhan naman niya. After that nagkwentuhan kami and umuwi na rin ako by 10pm and hinatid niya ko. And nasundan pa na 2nd, 3rd and 4th date. Nov 11 supposedly his flight going back to US. that time he made me believe na pabalik na siya and nasa flight na nga siya. Then kinabukasan he surprised me outside my house he showed up without me knowing na nag extend siya ng 5 days cuz he told me that he still wants to be with me. Sobrang wholesome namin the whole time and we really do such couple things talaga. And then Nov 16 came, official flight na talaga niya and I asked him if he wants to continue to do LDR and he said yes! So time goes by nakabalik na siya don we do videocalls everyday even at his work, gym and up until pag uwi niya. So I never thought about that he’s cheating on me.

I usually go to church every sunday by myself. Then I prayed for god that if he’s really the right guy for me, give me a sign. But if not, ilayo nalang siya sakin and give me a sign too. Then boom, kinabukasan while he’s on his way to work and were doing videocalls, may pinapakita siya sakin na mountain sa video and nahagip yung sa passenger seat, that was the time that I saw the heart shape handle in his car. Then I asked him about that and then he said wala lang trip niya lang yun and tig isa sila ng tropa niya and so whatever. Im not convince sa sinabe niya. Then while he’s at work im scrolling, I saw his father’s FB profile on my feed and clicked it rightaway and then andun lahat ng proofs, he’s already married and has a daughter. The moment that I found out, I literally breakdown and crying. Halo halong emotion naramdaman ko. But pinakalma ko sarili ko and I confronted him and he said to me na sasabihin naman daw niya dapat sakin yun pero naunahan ko lang siya. Like wtf! He had the chance na hindi na ituloy yung LDR namin nung pabalik siya pero nag insist siya na ituloy. Also, married daw siya pero sa papers lang. Wala na kong pake sa mga kasinungalingan niya after that he messaged me and apologizing to me and I didn’t reply to him anymore. The day that I found out, I message his wife immediately and we talked and she asked me for all the proofs that I have. And I sent it all to her. And this is the last message of his wife to me. I don’t know until now ang sakit pa din and this is my first time to experience this kind of thing. No amount of words that can take away the pain that I’m dealing right now. Ang sakiiiiit, all I did was to give him a pure love and care for him. I’m a genuine person and he knows that. Why am I suffering with this? I was blinded to see all the red flags with him because he love bombed me. Honestly I can see the potential to him as my partner and that’s the most heartbreaking part for me. Ang sakit sobra! He really love bombed me, I get fooled by him and he take advantage of me. To the point na nag extend siya because he wants to be with me and even if nandon na siya sa US pinapadalahan niya ko ng foods here sa office. I can see all the efforts but god, he’s a pathological liar. This is so traumatizing after 2 years of being single and now nalang ako nagpapasok ng guy sa life ko.

I would like to ask if how can I cope up with this? Everyday ina anxiety ako. Hindi ko na nagagawa yung everyday na pag ggym and ultimo pagkain wala akong gana.

I’ve been living in Toronto for about 3 years now. Moving to a new continent wasn’t easy, and only recently I’ve started to feel more settled and grounded here.

I realized it would be really nice to expand my social circle and meet more people for casual, friendly hangouts.

I’m 29, work in marketing, and I’m into tech startups, entrepreneurship and mentoring. I live close to downtown and enjoy simple things — grabbing matcha lattes / espresso martinis, or just sitting somewhere and talking about life.

If you’re in marketing, tech, startups or creative fields — even better, we’ll probably have plenty to talk about.
Open to meeting both women and men, but this is NOT dating, just friendly connections.

Happy to join a small group or just meet one-on-one for a coffee/matcha/shisha/pizza/sushi/ice cream/ramen/whatever. 😁
Thanks!

1pnsfm4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pnsfm4,"Georgia, sweet, sweet Georgia keeps pulling on my ring🎶🎶🎶","This is a bit of a different haul but contains what may be the original MRE. So JermsMRE did a review a few weeks ago about a Georgian snack company that reached out to him after his Georgian MRE review. The company is called Sweet Supra and they provide a plethora of various Georgian foodstuffs including a snack called churchkhela. It's a roughly 3000 year old traditional snack made with nuts or dried fruits that are coated in a grape must based candy that are left to air dry and can be eaten on the go. For those that enjoy reading more I included the link.

I ended up ordering the snack box, churchkhela box and spice box. Each box is the eye catching design in the first two pics and comes with a little thank you card and mini poster. There are many items in each box as you can see in the pictures. 

The spice box has several different spices and spice mixes. I love to cook and love trying my hand at different ethnic cuisines. So I'm looking forward to finding a few Georgian recipes to try. 

The churchkhela box has several different types in it. I can tell at least one hazelnut and walnut one. The coatings are different fruit bases other than the grape must. Grape must is the pressed grape juice used in winemaking and is similar to the wort in beer making. In Italy the must is used to make balsamic vinegar. Just a little fun fact for those that might be wondering. 

The snack box has several different dried fruits including plum and apple fruits leathers and two ""fancy"" churchkhela. After dinner I decided to try a churchkhela. It's a double walnut version that is definitely packed to be a fancy snack or a gift. It had the outer plastic and then a vacuum sealed plastic sheath. 

First thing after opening the pack is how smooth and shiny it is. It's almost like a wax coating on the walnuts. There was the faintest of wine like smell to it. I had to really sniff hard to get it. I was trying to bite between the nut clusters so I could get the full effect. Now look here ya dirty minded freaks...I can hear your snickering when I say nut cluster. Anyways the texture is a weird combination of the waxy coating and a fresh nut meat texture. The walnut didn't taste roasted or have that roasted texture. It was like eating a freshly shelled one. Nothing wrong with it, I was just expecting a roasted nut. The coating was waxy but not a sticky, chewy mess. Even touching it there was no sticky residue. The flavor was a faint wine similar to the smell. You could just pick it up. Otherwise it was pretty bland and not that sweet. It was very dry when eating it and extremely thirst provoking. For many people this might be bad things, especially us Americans as we're used to extremely sweet candies. But dare I say this might be the perfect snack or at least something close to it. Low sweetness, loaded with healthy stuff and requires you to hydrate. The packages states that it goes good with coffee, tea, wine and cheese. I have three of those and can get the fourth. Some experiments will happen real soon. 

I look forward to trying the other snacks and doing some sort of reviews on them as well. I'm not paid for any of this and didn't receive any products as compensation. I just thought it was cool and threw some of my hard earned dollars at it for part of my Christmas present to myself. ",3,1765858001.0,MRE,5,0.8,False

Midday coffee, a quiet rebellion,

the air hums with almost and lights,

and I realize gratitude isn’t loud

it’s warm, it’s simple, it lingers.



I’m strangely weird, and that’s normal,

like drinking coffee when the sun is high,

like finding peace in the pause between sips.

I'm interested in building a group for platonic connections (major emphasis on this as I do have a partner already) who are willing to meet up over coffee, drinks, food, or activities. Lately, it has been hard to connect with my old friends due to conflicting schedules, and my current workplace has a much older demographic, making it tough to level with them, so I'm hoping to form a new set of friends!  


A little about me (again, 28M from Pasig)

\- i'm a Project Manager by trade.

\- an INTJ (for whatever that's worth, heh).

\- i spend a good amount of my free time gaming on pc and switch

\- i balance the screen time with fitness; specifically running and working out (mostly at home these days)

\- my partner and i owns 2 cats 

\- recently got back into reading to minimize screen time



I'm looking for people who:

\- people who enjoy genuine, thoughtful conversations and can talk about more than just surface-level topics.

\- plain and simple—kindness and respect for everyone in the group

\- generally in the pasig/near area and willing to meet up on weekends 

\- someone who's willing to yap over group calls is great too since not all the time we're available haha

1pns92w,https://www.axios.com/2025/12/15/trump-economy-2026-income-inflation,Trump's article of faith: Economy will soar in '26,"President Trump and his advisers have an almost messianic belief the economy will take off in the first quarter of next year, based largely on stimulus from the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" he signed in July.

For the White House, it's an article of faith.

Trump's bullish belief is key to understanding why he's so reluctant to say there's an ""affordability crisis."" He calls that talk a ""hoax"" and a ""con job,"" advisers say, because the problem didn't start under him and the economy is growing steadily.

""It's a conundrum,"" said one Trump adviser who has discussed messaging with the president. ""He doesn't want to say 'affordability.' That's different than not wanting to talk about it.""

Both inside and outside the White House, Trump advisers are pinning their hopes on projections by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that Americans' finances and outlook will improve markedly during tax season:

The ""refund boom"": Working Americans could see as much as $2,000 in returns from the IRS during tax filing season because of the tax-and-spending bill. It extended Trump's 2017 tax cuts and gives new write-offs to some tip earners, Social Security recipients, overtime workers and parents, Bessent said last week.

Capital expenditures: Businesses can write these off, retroactive to Inauguration Day, providing more incentives to hire and raise wages. The administration says the expenditures have increased 15% since January. Independent analysts say it's closer to 8%, still strong.

Stocks: Most strategists expect markets, which soared this year, to go even higher in 2026, largely because of AI giants that have Trump's hearty backing.

Along with hoped-for reductions in inflation, lower interest rates and (continued) lower gas prices, Trump and his inner circle are counting on citizens benefiting from money-saving initiatives, from lax fuel economy standards to his prescription drug plans to sweeping deregulation.

""The sky-is-falling crowd is just wrong,"" the Trump adviser said.

The economy is ""going to take off like a rocket ship,"" said another.

Trump, a former developer and reality-show host, is a natural salesman who casts his policies in the most favorable terms — and believes in the power of positive thinking.

But his tariffs have driven up some prices, which he has tried to mitigate by rolling back import levies on coffee and beef.

And there are plenty of skeptics about the stability of the stock market, or the impact of no tax on tips, Social Security or overtime.

Beneath the upbeat tone, some in the White House are frustrated Trump isn't getting more credit for indicators that historically would be cause for celebration, or at least calm:

Real wages are up by about 1% percent since Trump took office.

Inflation is running around 3% and unemployment is under 4.5%.

Try telling that to people who are adamant they're paying more for groceries and electricity (as AP and NBC polls found in the past week), and think Trump's gaslighting them on the economy by making things sound better than they are (a memorable result of a CBS News/YouGov poll last month).

Affordable Care Act subsidies for 22 million middle-income Americans are also set to expire, which could create further headwinds.

In his first affordability speech in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Trump stepped all over his message with asides about ""sh*thole countries,"" railing against alleged Somalian welfare frauds and calling his predecessor as ""sleepy"" and ""corrupt.""

""If I read what was on the Teleprompter, you'd all be falling asleep right now,"" Trump said at one point. He also called the discussion about affordability a ""hoax"" because it doesn't account for the increased purchasing power people now have.

""I can't say 'affordability hoax' ... because they'll misconstrue that,"" Trump said. He's also called it a ""con job.""

Trump's adviser said: ""What he's calling a con job is the word 'affordability' and the way it's being used.""

Trump plans a nationwide address soon to cap off his first year in office. He'll hit the campaign trail ahead of the 2026 midterms and talk about affordability - but in his way.

Another Trump adviser said the president ""is who he is, and it's why he won. ... And next year, when the economy is taking off, we're going to say we told you so.""",2,1765857456.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,1,1.0,False

Like our parents have photos of us eating sand together. We basically grew up as one unit.

Around 4th grade, Avery realized they wanted to use they/them pronouns instead of she/her. Around the same time they went through a big self-discovery phase and eventually decided they were a therian. I never minded any of this. I don’t have an issue with LGBTQIA+ people or therians/furries, so I supported them 100%. I defended them from bullies, comforted them when friends ghosted them, and was always there when they were crying over not feeling understood.

They knew they were lesbian since middle school, and again, no problem there. The only thing that ever slightly annoyed me (and I feel bad even admitting this) is that their sexuality/identity came up in almost every single conversation. I’m straight and honestly don’t fully get a lot of it, but I always listened, nodded, responded, etc. because I loved them and didn’t care how they expressed themselves. Friendship > everything.

A few months ago I got into my first ever relationship with a guy, Derek (24M). This was during a REALLY bad time in my life. I have extreme chronic insomnia, and at that point I was sleeping like 2–3 hours a night, sometimes not sleeping at all for days. My doctor kept switching meds and nothing worked. I was exhausted, mentally fried, and honestly kind of miserable.

Derek was the first guy who made me feel like someone was actually listening to me. Which… yeah, red flag hindsight is 20/20 lol. The relationship ended up being super unhealthy. He crossed physical boundaries constantly and would grab my private areas without my consent. I had clearly told him it was my first relationship and that I wanted to take things slow. He did not care.

I started opening up to Avery about everything — the insomnia, the stress, how uncomfortable Derek made me feel. This was the first time in our entire friendship where I was the one needing real emotional support. Instead of helping, Avery brushed it off and told me I was overreacting. They acted like I was being dramatic for not wanting sex. I actually started wondering if I was the problem, which in hindsight is… yikes.

About a month into my relationship with Derek, Avery told me they were questioning their sexuality and thought they might be attracted to one of my good friends, Evan (24M). Evan hasn’t been in my life as long as Avery, but he’s genuinely kind and respectful and always made me feel heard (which apparently is my bare minimum now).

I was happy for Avery and wanted to support them. I thought they and Evan could be good together. I asked Evan how he felt and he admitted that he did like Avery at first, but once he found out they were lesbian, he forced himself to move on. I told him Avery might be reconsidering their sexuality and that if he still liked them, he should shoot his shot.

After like a week of thinking, Evan asked Avery out for coffee. They told me it went great, and not long after they started officially dating.

At first everything seemed fine. Avery constantly texted me updates and talked about how excited but “confused” they felt. But then I started noticing some weird stuff. Avery would joke around me about how dating a man felt “weird” or “unnatural” and would call themselves “temporarily straight” (haha…?). They never said this stuff to Evan directly (as far as I know), but it felt kind of gross.

Meanwhile, my relationship with Derek got worse. His behavior escalated and I finally realized this wasn’t just me being sensitive — it was sexual harassment. I broke up with him, which was terrifying because I was already so exhausted and vulnerable. I went to Avery for support AGAIN.

Instead, they told me I should’ve expected that from a guy and said “most men are like that anyway.” That comment genuinely broke something in me. Like cool, thanks for that take while I’m barely functioning.

Not long after, Evan messaged me privately. He said he was confused and hurt because Avery had been pulling away — canceling plans, avoiding physical affection, and constantly reminding him they were “still mostly into women.” He asked me if he did something wrong. I felt horrible because I was the one who encouraged him in the first place.

A week later, Avery broke up with Evan. Over text. They told him they rushed into things and that they were definitely lesbian after all. Evan was crushed and blamed himself, and I felt insanely guilty.

When I confronted Avery about how they handled the breakup, they got super defensive. They accused me of prioritizing a man’s feelings over queer self-discovery and said Evan should’ve known better. The argument escalated FAST. I told them I felt like I was always there for them, but when I needed support, they dismissed my pain.

Later, I found out from mutual friends that Avery had ALSO been mad at me because I was “talking too much” about my relationship with Derek. Which… okay? This was my first relationship, I was being harassed, and I had listened to YEARS of their identity talk without complaining, but sure.

The last time we ever spoke was the worst. Avery found me during my lunch break at work, cornered me, started screaming and cursing at me, and blamed me for everything. They got so angry they tried to slap me. A coworker literally had to step in. Very normal behavior from a 23 year old, obviously.

After that, I cut contact completely.

Now I’m sitting here wondering how a 20+ year friendship ended like this. I lost my best friend, hurt a good friend, and somehow became the villain in everyone’s story. I don’t know if I crossed a line or if this was just years of issues finally exploding.

So, my mum was diagnosed with dementia earlier this year and it’s progressing so much faster than I expected. She’s 71 in January. She had a heart attack last December which despite never losing consciousness etc, seems to have really exacerbated her symptoms. She was like a different person and seemed to have aged 10+ years by the time she got discharged 5 days later.

Mornings are her worst time. It’s when the confusion, wandering and speaking to her dead parents is most prominent. Come 11am and she’s almost ‘mum again’. 

​She’s losing her speech and it’s getting very difficult to have a coherent conversation with her as she either looses her words, or lumps 3 different conversations in to one… which is very hard to follow. Bless her. 

She goes on walks around the block on her own a few times a week, which she’s perfectly capable of when she’s not in a confused state, and attends a weekly group at the local church where they do activities, have tea and biscuits and socialise. 

My dad is trying his best to care for her but he’s 82 in Feb, has COPD, is malnourished (I believe he has an eating disorder. The drs are trying to get more calories in to him via milkshakes… which mum thought were for her, so she’s been enjoying those 😂), and Barrett’s oesophagus which he has had maximum treatment for and could very easily turn in to cancer. He’s also a chain smoker and spends most of his day watching tv.  

So the reason I’m posting… I need to vent, really. 

My dad is not capable of doing everything for mum, as much as he’d like to think he is. Particularly the things that she used to do like banking, paperwork, appointments and phone calls etc. I stepped in to take over that side of things as dad has never done them and isn’t comfortable doing them (he can’t use a mobile phone, laptop, tablet etc and puts off appointments and phoning people for as long as he can get away with. I think it’s due to untreated anxiety/ADHD), but my dad just sees me as interfering. 

In the last 7 days, dad and I have had 2 massive blow ups. Bigger than ever before. For me, it’s born out of frustration (and rejection, I guess). Both instances were over such minor things. 

The first was the door alarms… I fitted them but needed to adapt one to work properly due to the door not being flush to the frame. He didn’t like that I was looking around the house trying to find something suitable. In the end, he glared at me, shouted and made me feel tiny. All I’m trying to do is make sure mum is safe (which he can’t seem to get his head around), so I snapped, swore, raised my voice and told him ‘fine, you want to do everything yourself, go ahead. Don’t ask me for any help in future.’

The second was over me searching the house for medication that had gone missing. Dad was complaining that both his and mums dosset boxes had gone missing and he thought I’d taken them. I explained that mum might have squirrelled them away (as she’s at that stage now), so I started looking in all the random places they could be. I went to check ‘his’ draws in the 2 coffee tables they have and he absolutely lost it with me. Eyes bulging out his head, slamming draws, shouting, glaring. To me, it was completely inappropriate but maybe I’m wrong? Anyway, as always, I explained that I’m just trying to help but he kept shouting over me so I said “I’m not doing this again” and removed myself from the room. The sheer rage I felt is unlike anything I’ve ever felt before and I slammed my hands on the kitchen counter instead of screaming. 

In front of mum. 

Well done me.

I’m fully aware that I’m massively overreacting. But I’m done with him and his tantrums. HE ISN’T EVEN THE ONE WITH DEMENTIA! It’s born out of a naff relationship with my dad for 30 years, roughly 10 good years because I placated him and tried to understand him more (he had a shit childhood), but I can’t do it anymore because I need to make sure mum is getting the care she needs. 

He’s snapping at her often too (probably because he’s overwhelmed, but he won’t accept help) and she’s threatened several times to leave him. He’s never been physically violent but his words can be vicious and his delivery at times is quite frankly, disgusting.

The best way I can describe what dad might be feeling and reacting to is RSD (rejection sensitivity dysphoria). He’s always been like it, particularly with me (he’s jealous of mine and mums relationship and doesn’t like it when we spend too much time together) but it’s, really affecting mum now. Whereas she used to be able to just brush it off. 

Has anyone else been through similar? Do you have any suggestions? I have said to mum (when she was ‘good’) that I might have to step away a bit in a caring capacity, and they might need to hire someone to take mum on days out etc, as well as getting a carer to pop in a couple of times a day to make sure mum’s had her morning meds and has eaten breakfast/lunch. 

Does anyone have advice if she is adamant she no longer wants to live with him? She can’t live with me unfortunately as my stairs are very steep and I live on a main road (not ideal for a person that likes to wander). I also have my own issues going on and in all honesty, I don’t think I’d cope 24/7. 

Sorry for the long rant. I’m just so stuck on what to do. I don’t want to make things worse and make their living situation worse by merely trying to help, but I also can’t just stand by and watch. 

I’m have a history of drug use and self harm as coping strategies when things feel out of control, and I’m trying SO hard not to revert back to that. 

If anyone has been through similar or has any suggestions, I’d love to hear from you.

I'm 34. I've been raped at the ripe age of 12 when I didn't even know what rape was. I didn't think about it until it happened again when I was almost 20 (my bday is im december, this happened in 2011). Back then I was in a abusive relationship with my ex/babydaddy/the guy who ruined my life and every sense of self I have ever had. We started dating when we were both 18 back in 2009. I just got out of a long distance relationship and my grandmom that was like a second mom to me died of cancer. He just messaged me on a .. kinda like a dating site but not really .. I can't explain it other than you could post pics of yourself there and get ""rated"". Today it feels like I needed some kind of validation because I would never be on this site ever again. Anyways. I ignored all the red flags until it was too late. I moved to his parent's house in 2011 and we move together to our own apartment in 2012. He cheated on his girfriend when we got together and I knew.. today I am smarter and know better to get with trash like that but I was young and desperately wanted to get away from my toxic mother. As one would expect he chested on me too. Literally from day one. I found out and cheated back.. he found out, broke my computer and hit me for the first time and then raped me... My stupid ass was like ""okay I deserved it"". But then it happened again and again.. he would hit me without being provoked, he would rape me just because he wanted sex even on þy period.. In late 2011, november to be exact I had a surgery to remove endometriosis from my uterus and couldn't have sex for at least 6 weeks. He decided to sodomize me insted, how thoughtful of him.. after that I found yet another girl he was cheating on me with and I left his ass in early 2012 and moved back with my parents.. But he had way with words... Like man.. and again I really hated being around my mom so I went back after just a month..
We rented an apartament and moved in together in april and this is where the real ""fun"" began. I started drinking a lot to just numb myself and with time I think I just believed that I deserved what I was getting so I never said no again after he beat me so bad that I couldn't go to work for a week and had to wear heavy make up for a week after that. I never went to the police, never told anyone. I was absolutely terrified of that man. So I stayed and shut my mouth while he did everything he wanted. I tried to end myself 3 times dueing that year.. once coming very close but when I started passing out I chickened out. In may of 2013 we bought our first apartment and soon after I got pregnant. I belived every time he said he would never hurt me again and he would and then apologize and.. it just went on and on in circles. I hoped that the baby would change things.. and she did.. for a little bit. But It started again soon after she was 6 months old and needed much more of my attention than ever before. So he would just arrange his mom to take her for weekends and basically do whatever he wanted. I tried to kill myself again when she was 7 months old so around january of 2015.. again chickened out because I knew I couldn't leave her with this monster.. so I got like 13 stitches and got on with my misery. He started smoking weed which I didn't mind at first but soon after he went for amphetamine and started drugging my drinks so I would be ""easier""... He would constantly invite people over to have sex with us and I could never say no..... I drank.. a lot.. My daughter stsrted having night terrors at 1 years old and he couldn't stand not being able to sleep so he took the couch while I slept with out kid in the bedroom. It was A BLESSING! He withdrew, mostly left me alone aside from some slaps and punches here and there and I felt.. free.. as free as one can in this situation. His drug problem became a huge problem.. he spent all our money on weed and speed and whatever the fuck he didn't tell me about so we were drowning in debt and his mental health was... Non existent. He tried his first suicide when I wnated to leave in december of 2015.. so I stayed.. and in begging of 2016 everything seemed calm until he stopped showing up for work and I discovered hidden letters from banks and other companies that took care of reminding people of their debt in our country.. He lost it... And demanded open relationship. I agreed. Whatever gets him off of my body. But there was a catch.. I couldn't sleep with anybody.. I did anyway but whatever. Not important. In his few and far between moments of clarity he told me that I should find someone else to be with because he knew he wasn't good for me.. ok cool. We officialy broke up in july/august of 2016 but still lived in the same house. He would take his drugs and sleep with other people at nights and then sleep it off all day so I was basically free of him until dec of 2016. I came home one cold friday afternoon after picking up our daughter from preschool and having coffee with my friend. He was in bed.. I honestly don'4t remember what the fight was about anymore but he launched at me and hit me with a shouhorn and it hit her too. And that was it for me. I called his mom, they came, his dad held him away while I packed the essentials and they took us away. Around midnight he called me and I had my phone on speaker just in case. He told me that If I don't come home right now, he would hang himself.. that he was ready to push the chair from underneath him. His parents said no fucking way, his mom was convinced he would kill me.. long story short, he did it. His dad and his brother found him the next day. That was the 10th... Between that, funeral on 21st and the new years eve.. my whole december is a blur. 
My good friend have been there for me, he would come and cook for us and take care of my daughter when I couldn't get out of bed.. I was devasted. I blamed myself for leaving and not coming back when he told me what he was gonna do.. I was a wreck... Anyway.. My friend and I, we got close.. and had a lot of sex which is kinda important to this story (sorry). Started officially dating in feb of 2017. Yes, early, I know. I've heard it all already. But he was my rock (still is), he helped me get through the hardest time of my life and didn't expect a thing in return. We moved in together in april and things were great for a while. I suffered a mental breakdown around september 2017 and all went to shit for me but he stayed.. I went to therapy in beginning of 2018, and then to like a rehab.. just for mental illness ? (idk how to explain it better). With the therapy came the lack of intimacy because some things were worked through and some I felt were just opened and never worked on so they just lingered.. like all the rape for example.. I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ptsd.. and he was so understanding and patient and just the best. Honestly I felt like he was too good to be true and waited for the other shoe to drop any second. It didn't. I started feeling better and left the rehab in may 2021, intimacy came back and then gone and then came back again.. it was really on and off depending on my mental state.. I got pregnant with our child in late 2022 and our third daughter (I have one from my prev relationship, he has his and we have one together now, didn't mention it earlier cuz it didn't seem that important) was born in summer of 2023... And theeen my endometriosis came back and, you guessed it, no sex again... I got my uterus removed last year in october and after that we had sex like twice... Then my back went to shit, I got my scans in May and I'm not gonna go further into the details but..  I'm screwed.... 

And yeah... this is where we are today. It's been like a years since our last time.. I don't feel the need to have sex or to be touched at all to be honest, but I know he does..And he just wants me to get better.. mentally and physically.. and he is still waiting patiently and is so understanding and I feel like the worst girlfriend ever. He even fucking proposed to me.. like wtf is wrong with me. I have this amazing guy who Is the literall saint and I can't get myself to have one intimate moment with him once in a while?? I don't know what to do.. I'm starting therapy again in January but after being in therapy and still not feeling the need for intimacy before I don't know if this is gonna help at all.... I feel like I lied to him when we started dating with all the spicy times I gave him but today I feel like It was my toxic way of coping with all the abuse.. and when I finally felt safe the mask have fallen and I no longer felt the need to cope in that way. I feel angry at myself and I feel like he's wasting his prime years on me. 
I don't know.. It's late and I'm spiraling again...

I’m struggling with working out first thing in the morning. Ideally I want to wake up, have my coffee, and head straight to the gym. The problem is I just can’t get my body to cooperate.

Realistically I can only start training 2 to 3 hours after waking up. Anything earlier feels terrible and it makes me feel like I’m wasting a big chunk of my day just waiting to feel functional. Even when I do eventually start, my body feels stiff and heavy, almost like there’s concrete between my joints and everything is slow to move.

I’ve never really been a warm up guy at the gym. I know that’s probably part of the problem, but warming up always feels like it kills my flow and momentum before I even get into the workout.

For context, I’m 28 years old, around 94 to 96 kg, and 175 cm tall.

Is this just normal and I need to accept that mornings aren’t my time, or is there something I can do to feel less stiff and actually train properly soon after waking up? Anyone dealt with this and found something that helped?

Would not pay to drink it at coffee shops but will drink it if it's offered for free. Some might enjoy it but it's not for me.!<

- Colombia Young Producers' Program : >!10/10. Surprisingly tart and sweet. Intense strawberry notes and these really do smell like Pink Starburst. Would definitely purchase again. One of the best coffees I had this year. I might actually stock up on these and these would be off-limits for my butler.!<
   
- Colombia Diego Bermudez Castillo M-03 : >!8/10. Would drink again but may or may not purchase again. Tasting notes are almost spot on. A bit cinnamonny at times. Very smooth, sweet, and really warms you up. Great for cold weather.!<

Christmas is not just another travel season — it is an **emotionally driven holiday travel period**. Guests arrive with nostalgia, expectations, family memories, and sometimes quiet loneliness. When travelers book[ **Luxury Vacation Rentals in the USA**](https://www.llivo.com/p/luxury-vacation-rental-in-usa), they are not only choosing accommodation; they are seeking **comfort, warmth, and emotional security** during one of the most meaningful times of the year. This makes **Christmas hosting tips** essential for hosts who want to stand out.

https://preview.redd.it/d9yahcj9lh7g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c694f3a6e55c26ba467916ccec2eb13937cf31d

# 1. Start With a Warm, Human Christmas Greeting

Holiday travel often brings stress, delays, and emotional fatigue. A **warm Christmas greeting** from the host can immediately reduce anxiety and build trust. A simple message wishing safe travels and a peaceful stay feels **human and reassuring**, rather than automated.

This early communication sets the emotional tone of the stay. Strong **guest communication during holidays** helps create a lasting **relationship with renters**, which is critical for reviews and repeat bookings.

# 2. Keep Christmas Decor Simple, Soft, and Inclusive

Not every guest celebrates Christmas the same way. The most effective **holiday decor for vacation rentals** is subtle, inclusive, and calming. Soft lighting, neutral winter colors, and minimal festive accents create a warm ambiance without overwhelming the space.

Avoid heavy or religious decor unless your property is themed for the entire year. This inclusive mindset aligns naturally with[ **eco-friendly rentals for sustainable travelers**](https://www.llivo.com/p/green-vacation-rentals), where intention matters more than excess.

# 3. Create a Cozy First Impression

First impressions matter most during the holidays. Walking into a warm, softly lit home immediately signals **care and preparation**. Turning on lamps, setting a comfortable temperature, and placing a folded blanket on the sofa all support a **cozy holiday stay**.

To strengthen that first moment, focus on a few essentials:

* **Warm lighting** instead of harsh overhead lights
* **Comfortable temperature settings** before arrival
* **Soft textiles** like blankets or cushions
* **A short handwritten welcome note**

These small details create **emotional comfort for guests**, which often matters more than luxury amenities at Christmas.  
Walking into a warm, softly lit home immediately signals **care and preparation**. Turning on lamps, setting a comfortable temperature, and placing a folded blanket on the sofa all support a **cozy holiday stay**.

Small details, such as a handwritten welcome note help create **emotional comfort for guests**, which often matters more than luxury amenities at Christmas.

# 4. Make the Kitchen Feel Like Home

Food is deeply connected to emotion during Christmas. Even guests who are not cooking full meals appreciate a kitchen that feels **usable and familiar**. Clean mugs, a working kettle, tea or coffee, and clear instructions all contribute to a **home-like holiday experience**.

Providing these basics while adhering to clear policies and best practices ensures the kitchen remains functional, welcoming, and stress-free for holiday travelers.

# 5. Support Safe Holiday Travel and Transportation

Christmas travel comes with increased risks, such as heavy traffic and winter conditions. Hosts who think beyond the front door demonstrate **responsible holiday hosting**. Sharing safe routes, trusted transport options, or pickup services improves guest confidence.

This level of support can directly **boost occupancy with pickup services**, especially for guests arriving late or traveling alone.

# FAQs

**Do I need to decorate heavily for Christmas hosting?**  
No. Simple, inclusive decor is often more appreciated than heavy or religious decorations. Subtle touches create warmth without pressure.

**Should hosts communicate more during Christmas stays?**  
Yes, but gently. Clear **guest communication during holidays** builds trust, while respecting privacy helps guests feel safe and comfortable.

**How can I make solo travelers feel welcome at Christmas?**  
Focus on warmth, availability, and thoughtful preparation. Small gestures often matter more than big efforts during emotional travel periods.

# Final Words

Christmas hosting is not about perfection — it is about **presence, empathy, and intention**. When hosts focus on **human-first hospitality**, a rental becomes more than accommodation; it becomes part of a guest’s holiday memory. Guests may forget details, but they never forget how you made them feel.

But we split about 5 months ago, because she was going to college and her feeling like we were both very physically ppl, and that the distance would put a strain. Which that I completely understand. We agreed that we wouldn't look for anyone else. Well i asked her if we could try long distance after a little while of just chatting as friends. She tells me she has a new boyfriend,M18, and she tells me that we should have some space and i should try to move on. Im already bugged by this but the guy looks pretty fuckin similar to me, had a lot of the same interests, even had the same stupid look i do in all the photos. Well two weeks go by and i have a medical question to ask cause she was the only person who would know what to tell me. We started chatting again. And i asked her if we could have coffee when she get back from college for Christmas break and she said sure. I want to know how to express to her that i still love her with all my heart, and that i wish she would look deep down and try to find what we had still in her heart.

I thought I was making progress with my coworkers but I saw they all went out without even asking if I wanted to go.

Im so lonely, most times im talking to people im reaching out first or the convo ends quickly. I only have one friend i speak to daily. I love him and hes my best friend, but he lives in another state so we cant hang out much outside of texting.

I dream of being a likeable person who has friends, I dont need a lot. Just a few close friends would make me happy. I wish I had friends I could call, text daily, send silly memes or whatever. Go out to get coffee or go to record stores or thrift or concerts with. Im emo and obsessed with alt music, it would mean so much to me to share that with people but everyone thinks im a socially awkward and boring freak and dont want to hang out with me obviously. 

Im going to be alone forever and I should probably just take my life because I feel like ive tried everything. Meds, Therapy, putting myself out there, going out more, none of it has worked and im so tired.

1pnri90,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pnri90/i_think_my_dad_made_my_childhood_toys_with_people/,I think my dad made my childhood toys with people.,"My mother’s death didn’t feel real until I unlocked the front door of my childhood home and the smell hit me all at once. Old dust, pine cleaner, and something sweeter beneath it that I couldn’t place. 

It was the smell of a place that had been waiting without changing, the way houses do when they’ve outlived the people who loved them. 

My dad stood behind me while I fumbled with the lock, his hands folded loosely at his waist, posture relaxed, patient. He looked exactly the same as he always had. Older, yes, grayer at the temples, but intact in a way that felt unfair considering the funeral we’d just buried my mother in.

He hugged me when I stepped inside, firm and warm and entirely convincing. 

I remember thinking, stupidly, that if there were ever signs something had been wrong with him, they would have shown themselves by now. He’d been a good father. Attentive. Creative. He made things with his hands. He remembered birthdays. He read to me when I was little. These were the thoughts I clung to in the early days, before I started remembering the toys.

The house was quieter without my mom. Not emptier—just wrong. Her things were still everywhere, but they’d already begun to feel like props left behind after a play had closed. 

My dad told me to take my time, said I could stay as long as I needed while we sorted things out. He mentioned my old room, said it was mostly untouched. 

When I asked him, casually, if he’d kept any of my toys, he smiled in that familiar, indulgent way and told me they were still in my toy box, same place they’d always been. There was something about the way he said it that lingered with me, though at the time I couldn’t have told you why.

My childhood bedroom looked smaller than I remembered. The posters were gone, the shelves bare except for dust outlines where things used to sit, but the toy box was still there at the foot of the bed. 

I remember hesitating before opening it, not because I was afraid, but because grief has a way of making even neutral memories feel dangerous. 

Inside were the wooden action figures my dad had always made for me. Not store-bought toys, not plastic or soft or colorful, but carefully carved figures with jointed limbs and tiny cloth clothes stitched by hand. Knights, soldiers, travelers, figures that looked like they belonged to some older story. My mom used to say they were charming. I used to agree.

I lifted them out one by one and set them on the floor. They were heavier than I remembered. Each of them had the same strange symbol carved into their chests beneath their clothes, something I’d noticed as a kid but never questioned. 

A triangle, lines drawn from each edge inward, converging into a circle marked with an X. As a child, I’d assumed it was just my dad’s signature, the way artists sign their work. Seeing it again made my stomach tighten for reasons I couldn’t articulate.

My favorite was missing though.

The knight with the javelin had been my constant companion for years. I used to carry him everywhere, even slept with him under my pillow until my mom insisted he’d rip the bed sheets.

I found him eventually, shoved into the back of my closet beneath a pile of old coats. He was different. 

The wooden javelin was driven straight through his chest, embedded deep enough that the point protruded from his back. His hands were still wrapped around the shaft, fingers carved into the shape of desperate grip, angled inward as if he’d done it himself.

I stood there for a long time holding him, waiting for the sense of wrongness to resolve into something manageable. 

I tried to tell myself it was damage, something I’d done as a kid and forgotten, but I knew I hadn’t. The carving was too precise. The force implied by the depth of the wound was impossible. When I pressed my thumb against the wood near the hole, it felt warmer than the rest of him.

That night, I woke to a sound I didn’t recognize at first. Not a crash exactly—more like weight being released all at once. Wood against wood, then against the floor. 

It came from my bedroom, a dense, unified clatter that had no stagger to it, no echoing sequence. Just one moment of impact, as if something had been let go.

I lay still for several seconds, listening for footsteps or my dad’s voice, for any sign that someone else had heard it too. The house remained silent. 

When I finally sat up and turned on the lamp, the light revealed the shelf above my dresser completely bare. Every wooden figure lay on the floor below it, scattered outward in a rough semicircle. 

None of them were stacked or tangled. They hadn’t fallen into each other. They’d landed apart, spaced in a way that felt deliberate, though I couldn’t have explained how.

I picked one up and checked the shelf with my hand, running my fingers along the wood. It wasn’t warped. It wasn’t loose. I pressed down on it harder than necessary, half-expecting it to give or crack or prove my dad right before he’d even said anything. 

It held firm. When I set the figure back upright on the dresser, I noticed something that made my chest tighten: its head was angled slightly upward, not enough to be obvious, but enough that its carved eyes were no longer facing the wall where the shelf had been. They were pointed toward the bed.

I told myself that was coincidence. That gravity, vibration, and my own exhaustion were enough to explain it. I put the rest of the toys back without looking at their faces, turned off the lamp, and lay there until morning with the blanket pulled up to my chin like I was ten years old again. 

Nothing else happened that night. Nothing moved. 

My dad was already up when I came into the kitchen. He stood at the stove in an old T-shirt and slippers, cracking eggs into a pan like he’d done a thousand mornings before. 

The radio played softly on the counter, some local station talking about traffic. For a moment, watching him from the doorway, it was easy to believe the night had been nothing more than a bad dream layered over grief.

“Morning,” he said without turning around. “You sleep okay?”

“Not really,” I said. I sat at the table and rubbed my eyes. “Did you hear anything last night?”

He glanced over his shoulder, eyebrows lifting just a little. “Like what?”

“A noise, it was like the middle of the night, in my room.“

He turned the burner down before answering. 

“House is old, it settles at night. Especially when the temperature drops.”

“All of my toys fell off the shelf.”

That made him pause. Just long enough to notice, but not long enough to feel intentional. He resumed stirring the eggs, scraping the pan with slow, even movements.

“Did they break?”

“No.”

“That’s good, I made them pretty solid.”

I didn’t respond right away. He slid the eggs onto a plate and set it in front of me, along with two slices of toast. He always did that—fed people first.

“They all fell at once,” I said finally.

He sat across from me and took a sip of his coffee. “That happens, weight shifts. Wood expands. Kind of feels like magic, doesn’t it?”

I watched his face as he spoke, looking for something I could point to later and say that’s when it started. There wasn’t anything. He looked tired, sad. Sad, in the way people get after funerals when they’re finally allowed to stop being strong.

“I was thinking about those toys. You kept all of them?”

“Of course I did, why wouldn’t I?”

“I don’t know, just figured maybe some of them got thrown out over the years.”

He shook his head, almost smiling. “You don’t throw things like that away. Not things that still have a reason.”

“What reason?” I asked.

He looked at me then, really looked at me, like he was weighing whether the question deserved an answer. “Memories,” he said after a moment. 

“Some things are worth keeping close. They help you remember what matters.”

I laughed before I could stop myself. It came out wrong, too sharp. “You always did talk like that.”

He smiled back, unbothered. “I’ve always believed you should live with the results of things. Otherwise they don’t mean much.”

I stared down at my plate. The eggs had gone cold.
“Did you move anything in my room? After I went to sleep?”

“No, I didn’t go in there.”

“Are you sure?”

He nodded. “I wouldn’t touch your things without asking. Never have.”

That was true. He’d always been careful about that. Respectful even of his own kids property. It was one of the things I loved about him.

As I stood to take my plate to the sink, he added, casually, “If you’re going through the toy box, try not to mix them up too much. They were all made a certain way.”

I paused with my back to him,“What do you mean?”

“Just that they fit where they fit,” he said. “Things tend to get uncomfortable when they’re moved around too much.”

I waited for him to say more. He didn’t.

He went back to see his coffee, and the radio kept talking about traffic, and for a few seconds everything felt almost normal again. 

It wasn’t until later, when I noticed the same strange symbol carved into the handle of a hammer in his workshop, that I realized how carefully he’d chosen every word.

I tried to be rational about it at first. Grief does strange things to memory, and memory does worse things when given time alone in familiar places. 

Faces blur. Details rearrange themselves to fit narratives you don’t realize you’re building. That’s what I told myself when I picked up the smaller wooden figure again—the one in the plain tunic—and felt that crawling sense of familiarity tighten in my chest.

It wasn’t an exact likeness. My dad hadn’t carved portraits. The faces were simplified, smoothed down to essentials: cheekbones, brow, jaw. But the proportions were right in a way that felt intimate. The slight bend in the nose. The way the mouth slanted downward on one side, as if caught mid-thought. I carried the figure to the window and held it in better light, rotating it slowly, forcing myself to find differences. The more I looked, the fewer I found.

Evan. The neighborhood kid who used to shove me into hedges and steal my bike when I was too small to stop him. He’d gone missing the summer I turned eleven. People said he ran away. His parents moved not long after. I hadn’t thought about him in years.

I put the figure down harder than I meant to and backed away from the shelf. My heart was racing, not with fear exactly, but with the kind of adrenaline that comes when your mind is trying to outrun a conclusion it doesn’t want to reach. 

I spent the rest of the morning avoiding the room. When my dad asked if I wanted to help him sort through the garage, I said yes too quickly.

That was where I noticed the symbol again.

It was carved into the wooden handle of a hammer hanging above the workbench. The same triangle, the same lines drawn inward, converging at that marked circle. It was faint, worn smooth by years of use, but unmistakable. 

I reached out and brushed dust from it with my thumb, and a wave of nausea rolled through me so suddenly I had to grab the bench to stay upright. The world tilted, darkened at the edges, and for a second I was convinced I was going to be sick right there on the concrete floor.

“You okay?” my dad asked from behind me.
I nodded too fast. 

“Yeah. Just… stood up too quick.”

He didn’t press it. He never did. That was another thing I’d always loved about him.

I started noticing the symbol everywhere after that. 

On the handles of garden shears. Etched faintly into the underside of a shelf bracket. Burned into the corner of a cutting board my mom used to keep out on the counter. 

Once I saw it, I couldn’t unsee it. It was consistent every time, precise in a way that ruled out coincidence. I tried to tell myself it was some old maker’s mark, a habit he’d never broken, but the thought didn’t hold. My dad wasn’t sentimental like that. He didn’t repeat himself without reason.

That afternoon, I went back to the toys.

I lined them up on the floor, farther apart this time, giving each one space. There were more of them than I remembered. 

Some I recognized immediately—the knight, the soldier with the cracked helmet, the woman in the long dress whose hands were carved folded in front of her chest. 

Others felt unfamiliar in a way that bothered me more. People I didn’t remember, but somehow knew.

The businessman was the worst.

He wore a carved suit jacket with real buttons sewn into it, tiny and functional. His hair was neatly parted, his posture rigid. 

When I lifted him, I noticed the faint indentation around his neck, like a collar pressed too tight for too long. I knew who he was before I let myself say it. 

My dad’s former boss. 

The man who used to come over for dinner sometimes, who laughed too loudly and never remembered my name. He’d been found dead in his office years ago. Heart attack, they said. Stress.

I dropped the figure and backed away until I hit the bed.

The pattern was impossible to ignore now. Every face I could place belonged to someone who had wronged my father in some small or significant way. 

A contractor who’d overcharged him and scammed him because he was the only contractor in the area. A neighbor who’d threatened to sue over a property line. People who had disappeared, died suddenly, or simply stopped being talked about. People who had, until now, only existed as half-remembered stories.

That night, I took the knight down from the shelf again.

I don’t know why I chose him. Maybe because he’d always been my favorite. Maybe because the spear through his chest felt like an accusation I couldn’t answer. 

I sat on the edge of the bed and turned him over in my hands, tracing the carving marks, the tiny imperfections left by my dad’s tools. The symbol was there beneath his tunic, deeper than on the others, the lines pressed so hard they’d split the grain.

On impulse, I lifted the knight’s head and pressed his mouth to my ear.

At first, there was nothing. Just the faint smell of old wood and dust. Then, so quietly I almost missed it, I heard something that might have been breath. A sound too soft to be sound, more like pressure. I held still, afraid that even the act of listening might make it stop. The noise shifted, tightened, and then I understood what it was.

Screaming.

Not loud. Not clear. Muffled and distant, like it was coming from the bottom of a well. Pain stretched thin and folded in on itself, endless and trapped. 

My hands started shaking so badly I almost dropped him. When I pulled him away, the sound stopped instantly, leaving the room unbearably silent.

I put the knight back where I’d found him and didn’t touch the toys again.

Later, at dinner, my dad asked me if I’d slept any better. I told him I had. He nodded, satisfied, and went back to eating like nothing in the world had changed. 

I watched him chew, watched the steady rise and fall of his chest, and wondered how many people were still screaming in the quiet spaces of this house.

That night, I dreamed of wood splitting under pressure, of hands clawing at the inside of something that would never open.

I didn’t go looking for anything else. I want that to be clear. I wasn’t brave enough for that, or noble, or driven by any sense of obligation to the people I’d come to understand were trapped in my childhood toys. 

What I was, more than anything, was unable to sit still with what I knew. Once you accept a truth like that, even partially, the world rearranges itself around it. Every familiar thing becomes suspect. Every quiet moment stretches too long.

The house had a way of guiding me without asking. I’d find myself standing in doorways I didn’t remember walking to, staring at corners I’d passed a thousand times without noticing. 

The backyard was one of those places. I hadn’t been out there since I arrived, not really. It was late afternoon when I stepped outside, the light thin and pale, the grass dry from weeks without rain.

The far edge of the yard sloped gently downward toward a line of trees. There was nothing remarkable about it. No shed, no fence, no marker of any kind. Just a stretch of ground my dad kept meticulously neat, even now. 

I don’t know what made me walk that way. Maybe it was the way the sod looked slightly newer there, greener in a patch that didn’t match the rest. Maybe it was just the accumulated weight of everything else.

I knelt and brushed my hand over the grass. The soil beneath felt firmer than it should have. When I pushed harder, my fingers struck something solid.


The trap door was almost invisible. A square of concrete fitted so tightly into the ground it looked like part of the earth itself. 

It took real effort to lift it, my fingers slipping against the edge until I managed to wedge them underneath. As the door swung open, a smell rose up to meet me—cold, mineral, and layered with something darker beneath it. I gagged and had to turn my head away.

A narrow set of steps led down into a small concrete room. No lights. No windows. Just a single object at the center of the space.

The altar was made of ebony wood, polished to a dull sheen that absorbed light rather than reflecting it. 

It was scarred with cuts and burns, its surface pitted in places like it had been worked over again and again. 

Around it lay remnants I didn’t want to catalog but did anyway: clumps of hair caught in the corners, gray ash ground into the concrete, scraps of leather stiff with age, thread tangled and knotted like something abandoned mid-task. 

There were stains too, dark and uneven, soaked deep enough into the floor that no amount of scrubbing could have removed them.

I stepped inside despite every instinct screaming at me not to.

The symbol was carved into the altar’s surface, larger and deeper than anywhere else I’d seen it. Dust filled the grooves, softening the lines. 

I crouched and brushed it away with shaking hands, revealing the triangle, the converging lines, the marked circle at the center. 

The moment the last of the dust cleared, my stomach lurched violently. Pain bloomed behind my eyes, sharp and disorienting, and the room seemed to fold inward on itself.

I remember thinking, that this must be what severe vertigo feels like.

Then I was on the floor.

The concrete was cold against my cheek. My mouth tasted like metal. For a few seconds—maybe longer—I couldn’t tell if I’d lost consciousness or if time had simply skipped. 

When I pushed myself up, my hands came away damp with sweat. My heart was hammering so hard I could see my pulse in my wrists.

Nothing else had happened. No voices. No visions. No answers. Just a body reacting to something my mind couldn’t comprehend.

I closed the trap door and replaced the sod as carefully as I could, like a child trying to erase evidence of a mistake. When I went back inside, my dad was in the living room watching television. He looked up and smiled.

“You disappear on me?”

“Just needed some air,” 

He nodded, accepting it without question. “Dinner’s in an hour.”

That night, I lay awake listening to the house. Not for footsteps or movement, but for the absence of it. 

The toys didn’t fall again. Nothing shifted. The silence was complete, and in that silence, I understood something that hurt worse than fear.
He was never going to explain it.

There would be no confession, no confrontation, no moment where I could demand names or reasons or mercy. 

Whatever he had done, whatever rules governed it, he had folded it so completely into the fabric of his life that it had become invisible to him. 

He loved me. I believe that. He loved me enough to keep me separate from it, to give me toys instead of truth, to let me grow up surrounded by suffering I was never meant to recognize.

In the morning, I packed my things.

My dad helped me load the car, moving carefully, deliberately, the way he always did. 

When I hugged him goodbye, his arms were steady around me. Solid. Human. He told me to drive safe. He told me to call when I got home. He stood in the driveway and waved until I was out of sight.

I didn’t take any of the toys with me.

I think about them often now, lined up on shelves and in boxes, waiting in a house that still smells faintly of pine cleaner and dust. 

I think about the people they used to be, about the pain of existing inside something that cannot die. I think about the knight most of all, and how he must have realized what he was long before I did and had tried to do something about it.

Sometimes I wonder if leaving them behind was a mercy.

Sometimes I wonder if it was just another way of pretending I didn’t know.",16,1765855226.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1pnrcr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanrock/comments/1pnrcr5/where_is_goal_of_life/,where is goal of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

This chapter explores heavy themes, including religious trauma, emotional abuse, domestic violence, infidelity, and manipulation. Some scenes may be distressing to readers with similar experiences. Please take care while reading.

  
Mom and I sit at the dining room table in silence. My fangs are still out, and even the house itself seems to be holding its breath amidst the tension. Only the din of passing cars outside ties me — lightly — to the outside world.



“Well, Ronnie,” she begins gently, “I’m sure you have a lot you want to talk to me about. Matthias’s weird interrogation only added to your bad day.”



All I want to do is retract my fangs again and go back to being the fun, normal Ronnie who plays baseball and eats pizza with her friends. But I know that then I’d get the whole “just be yourself, you’re beautiful as you are” talk that all parents probably give their kids. I can feel how red my eyes are from crying; all my anxieties boiled over like Annie’s mac and cheese she makes in the apartment.



But I can’t do this. I’ll deal with the cheesy talks I have to, but right now I just want this to stop.



So, I retract my fangs. There’s a slight sting in my gums as I pull them back in.



Mom doesn’t really seem to react, but I quickly think of something to say before she can.



“Mom, why am I the way that I am? How did we even get here?”



She hesitates, but the second she begins to speak again, I notice a sense of fear— unease, and the feeling that she’d always known we’d have this conversation one day. She nervously twists her wedding ring, and her hands begin to tremble.



“Honey, you’ve always been the way you are. But, there are just some things we can’t, and ultimately shouldn’t, run away from.”



As she speaks, her own inch-long fangs show. Whiter than snow, and sharper than razors. And beside the collar of her cardigan sweater, I notice them for the first time in a long time. Two small puncture scars. About two inches apart. Healed over, but unmistakable. 



She briefly choked up for a second and waved her hand in front of her face, but quickly calmed down when she said to herself: “*Be strong, Viv. You can do this*.”



Seeing that her eyes were beginning to gloss over, I cut in.



“Mom, why don’t I make us some hot cocoa? We should have the stuff for it in the fridge, right?”



She silently nodded, and I got a saucepan on the old GE stove. The whole kitchen looks like it was put together in 1910, 1940, 1990, and to a *tiny* degree, just yesterday. Each head of the Day dynasty has put their own touch on it over the one hundred and fifty years.



When we get our mugs on the table, Mom’s much calmer. We drink our hot cocoa, and she tells me her story.



Mom wasn’t always this way. She was born Vivienne Elizabeth Lyle in Saline, IL, on June 1, 1977, to my grandparents, Chris and Elizabeth “Lizzy” Lyle. She was the third-born in a family of six kids, and like many middle children, always seemed to be misunderstood and different from everyone around her. More creative, empathetic, and curious about people Grandpa called *different—* *lost sheep*, or *not like us*. 



Living just outside of the Shawnee National Forest, Mom grew up in a family that wasn’t just devoutly Southern Baptist— she was the preacher’s daughter. Grandpa was the only preacher for the tiny Saline Baptist Church and had the whole town wrapped around his finger. His family was considered to be perfect, Godly, and whenever Grandpa wanted something from you, he *knew* how to get it.



“He loved me. He loved all of us. But love doesn’t mean safety. It doesn’t mean that our heavenly family didn’t turn to hell when the church doors closed, and our house doors opened.”



As she grew up, Mom had no hope of anything outside of Saline. Her set purpose in life was to grow up to be a good Christian woman who stood by her husband no matter what. No matter how angry he got. No matter which of her children he would take off his belt for on a given day. No matter how scared she got when he entered a room.



When she was eighteen, Mom had seen enough. One incident pushed her over the edge.



She had just graduated from high school and was walking home in her flowy, “diner tablecloth dress” as she described it. It was late, the crickets were chirping, but were being drowned out by a barking pitbull chained up in someone’s front yard. When she passed by her math teacher’s house with a rusted-out El Camino in its front yard, she heard a familiar, drawling, raspy voice yell, “Oh, shit! Quick, hide!” She knew instantly whose voice that was, but didn’t want to believe it. Her feet froze to the cracked sidewalk, and she just stared at the door. 



The door creaked open -- slow, guilty, the kind of sound that tells you whatever’s behind it is going to ruin something. Out stepped her twenty-two-year-old math teacher from that year, Ms. Taylor, barefoot, hair ruffled up, and with a very obvious hickey showing on her neck. She was scrambling to throw on a towel from her bathroom. 



Shortly after Ms. Taylor stepped out, Grandpa, who was fifty at the time, appeared. 



His shirt was unbuttoned down past his chest, and though it was soaked through with sweat, his face was drained of all color the second he saw Mom.



“Vivy, please… Baby girl… Don’t tell Mama,” was apparently what he said, knowing that if she said a word, he’d be ruined.



Mom told me she never decided to run -- only that her legs started to move again. Once they did, she didn’t stop until she reached Chicago. She had a friend who had moved up there a year earlier, and only went home long enough to pack a bag of essentials and to get some sleep before leaving on a Chicago-bound bus the next day. She didn’t want to tell anyone. She didn’t leave a note. She just left.



Or so she tried.



When she walked out the screen door, Grandpa was waiting for her. He looked meeker, and could barely look Mom in the eye. Like a little boy who knows why he’s in trouble, but still can’t own up to what he did as wrong. 



“You’re going to the bus in Carbondale, right, Vivy?”



Mom said nothing.



Grandpa tried again.



“How’s about I drive you?”



Mom agreed, and for the last time, she rode in her family’s giant Grand Caravan that they went to church every Sunday in. She sat down on the passenger seat made of splitting blue vinyl, and off they went. The van was so old that it creaked with every bump and turn, and it smelled exactly as you’d expect after years of six kids riding in it. The air hung between them like the dog days of August.



Most of the ride was spent in silence. 



When they passed by a cemetery in Marion,  Grandpa reverted back to his old ways.



“You know this is gonna crush Mama,” he began, “have you asked at all in the past eighteen hours what Jesus would—”



“Fuck you,” Mom cut him off sharply.



“All I’m saying, baby girl—”



“No. You don’t get that. Fuck you,” she clapped back louder this time. 



A few more minutes of silence louder than summer thunder passed. When they got to Carbondale, there was a short line in front of the ticket booth. 



Grandpa turned to Mom, and in a flat, almost robotic voice, murmured “I’ll always be with you, Vivy.”



“Yeah,” Mom replied.



She went to get out of the car, but a shock of anger came over her. One that had been dormant ever since Ms. Taylor’s door opened the night before.



“I might come back one day for Mama. But I don’t want to see you again. Ever.”



Grandpa just looked at the steering wheel, as if Mom’s stare would’ve turned him to stone like Medusa. He knew how in one night he’d gone from being the king of Saline, to a disgusting philanderer. Worst of all, Mom knew. If she told her mother, his marriage, family, and life would be over. 



He tried to mutter something, but only could muster those canned preacher words, “Okay… God be with you.”



Those words had never felt emptier. Or more pathetic.



Mom rolled her eyes, and got out of the front seat. She picked up her bag, and with eighteen years of anger, indoctrination and now grief overcoming her, slammed the passenger door as hard as she possibly could. Grandpa still just sat there, staring down as the car shook a little.



With that, Mom was in line for the bus. She was gone.



The following months passed by like they were only days. Mom stayed with her friend in a tiny apartment in Rogers Park and worked nights at a twenty-four-hour diner. She learned how to navigate the El, how to walk to work in the snow, and to *never* order ketchup on a hot dog. 



Over the next four years, she spent time trying to figure out who she was outside of rural Illinois. Who was Vivienne Lyle?



She’d get her answer in the most unlikely way.



In 1999, Mom and some friends went to a party downtown on the night of Mayor Daley’s inauguration. When she was about to go home for the night, she and her friends walked down the stairs at the CTA station on Jackson, and they bumped into a very tall, mysterious, and smartly dressed man. He had a deep red tie, and a brown suit jacket with an aquamarine tie clip. Mom literally walked into him.



“Oh, I’m so sorry!” The man began kindly, adjusting his suit jacket, “Are you okay?”



When Mom thanked the man and said she was fine, there was a moment of warm silence. She wasn’t sure if it was his welcoming smile, or velvety baritone voice, but this was the first time she’d been around a man without her stomach tying in knots. The man smiled and stretched out his hand.



“Let’s start over. My name is Theodore Day, but you can just call me Teddy. All my friends do.”



“Which way are you going?” Mom asked.



Teddy smiled, “Oh, I’m going north.”



“So am I!” Mom exclaimed.



Mom let her friends drift for a few minutes while she talked to her new friend. Both of them were very bummed when they found out Vivienne was going to Rogers Park, while Teddy had to get off at the Mag Mile. Before he left, though, Teddy pulled out a small notepad from his suit jacket and wrote down his phone number with a tiny pencil. 



She called him the next day, and things began to change faster than snow piles up in a Chicago winter. Coffee dates in Rogers and Lincoln Park turned to dinner dates in River North. El rides turned into taking drives up the North Shore to Kenosha on weekends in Teddy’s beautiful, red Cadillac. All the while, Teddy charmed his way right past the icy exterior Mom had built during her years in Saline. There were some odd characteristics he showed, though. 



Teddy had a job that he *said* he couldn’t really take any days off from. Despite only appearing in his late twenties, he said the mayor’s office depended on him to be ready for a crisis. Which, in a city like Chicago, “could happen at any time.” And according to Teddy, this often was the case.



He also had a strong aversion to garlic. When Mom tried to take him out for pizza, he was always adamant about no garlic butter being brushed on the crust. His excuse? Allergies he’d had since he was a boy. Mom didn’t question it-- why would she?



Even when she *did* go out with him during the day, he was always really layered up. Even during the summer, he was never seen without a long-sleeved linen shirt and an unmarked bottle of sunblock, which he said helped with his sun sensitivity. 



Then one day, it all came to a horrifying head. The man Mom grew to love had revealed who he truly was.



Mom had been to Teddy’s house a couple of times before, but around the early fall of 2000, Mom was invited to a large party for Teddy’s mother, Martha. That night, she met Teddy’s father, Atticus, as well as his siblings-- Susan, Franklin, Constance, Arthur… and Matthias, who made her skin crawl the moment she met him. 



Everyone gave off a distinct personality. Martha was a little persnickety, but very kind-hearted and gave great hugs. Susan, the eldest, didn’t talk much, but told Mom she was so happy that Teddy had met a nice girl. Franklin was boisterous, but smart. Teddy said he was always the prankster when they were growing up. Constance was a singer for the Chicago Opera, and wanted to know all of Mom’s favorite songs. Arthur just sat on the couch in the living room, reading a book, and now and then asked Mom some “polite small talk” sort of question. He also stepped in to change the subject whenever Matthias asked her something that made her uncomfortable. Her whole presence at the Day house seemed to be one big joke to him.



The second he saw Mom, he just laughed and turned to Teddy.



“Are you serious, Ted? You sure about this one?”



Teddy kept a very uncomfortable smile plastered to his face.



“Yes. This is Vivienne. Vivienne, this is my older brother, Matthias.”



Matthias stepped up slowly and shook Mom’s hand. 



“Have you two had pizza yet? Pasta? Gar--”



“Matty!” Arthur clapped his book shut and stood up. 



“Come on, I need you to give me a hand with bringing in the groceries I brought with me.”



For the rest of the night, Mom and Teddy had a great time. Susan made a great dinner for everyone, and Franklin had baked an amazing apple pie. All the while, she kept having to dodge Matthias and his uncomfortable questions.



*So, you just walk around with your neck exposed with him?*



*Has my brother shown you the fridge in his office yet, and the* ***special*** *drinks he has in it, on the top shelf?*



*Has he mentioned anything -- anything at all -- about* ***what*** *we do yet?*



But the worst interaction came when Teddy had fallen asleep on the couch in the front room. Mom looked at him, how peaceful he was. She gave him a soft kiss on the side of his head and said, “I know you can’t hear me, but I’m so lucky to have you in my life.” She was about to get up and walk back to the festivities when Matthias appeared again. 



“How adorable,” he said flatly.



“What do you want?” Mom clapped back, “What have I done to make you so suspicious of me?”



“You’re just not the kind of girl who I would have expected my little brother to bring home. Is that so bad?”



“No,” Mom responded, “But I can tell it’s more than just that. I know your brother has some quirks. He doesn’t really respond well to garlic, but it’s an allergy he’s had since he was a boy, right? You should know, you’re his brother.”



Matthias stopped cold and clapped a hand over his mouth to stop from laughing himself silly. Even with a hand over his mouth, his condescending, breathless laughter cut like a knife.



“Really? That’s a new one.”



“Oh, screw you!” Mom replied, her voice starting to get angrier -- and louder.



“Yell all you like. My siblings in the other room can pretend everything with you two is all hunky dory, but I’m gonna show you something.” 



He walked right past Mom to Teddy.



“Hey! Leave him be!” Mom snapped.



“Just come over here,” he replied, “I’m gonna show you something.”



And that’s when it happened. The thing that would change their relationship forever.



Matthias, with his large, ringed fingers, reached down to Teddy’s mouth and pulled back his upper lip. *Fangs.*



Mom had to stifle a scream as she stood over him sleeping, and leapt back, nearly tripping over the coffee table behind her knees. Everything in her world came to a screeching halt, and then started tumbling down. Her blood ran as cold as ice. Would this be Saline all over again? 



Matthias gave a small laugh. 



“Welcome to the family.” He patted her on the cheek and left the room.



Mom grabbed her things and bolted out of the room for the nearest bus stop back to Rogers Park. She was gone.



Our hot cocoa mugs are empty now. The drinks are consumed. The sun is down. Only silence remains.



“We can stop if you want, Mom,” I say. She looks eerily composed for someone who just finished such a personal story.



But, she gives a small laugh. *What? What about any of this could be funny to her?*



“You deserve the final answer. Why you’re different from people like Dad or Matthias.”



She pauses and starts to fidget with her wedding ring again.



“Even why you’re different from me.”



She takes a deep breath, softly claps her hands, and continues.



Even though Mom was shocked, she still stayed with Teddy -- Dad. He was smart, kind, curious about the world, and -- as you know -- so incredibly nurturing to those he loved. She wasn’t some head-over-heels schoolgirl, though. She didn’t call Dad for days after that incident with Matthias. It took him coming to Mom’s apartment, and her demanding answers. He told all.



He told her about the Days and their century-long influence in Chicago after having ruled Edinburgh from the shadows. He told her about the family’s connection to blood banks in the city. He even told her about how much he hated himself for having partaken in such horrible things to further the Day name. He wanted to change, though. 



Dad told her that instead of using the Day name for just piling up riches, for personal gain, he wanted to take a step back from the family operation. He wanted to start doing what he could *to help people*. He didn’t know how he’d begin to do it. All he knew was that he was his own man, not just a first name attached to a menacing last one.



So, she stayed with him. She accepted him for who he was, a vampire with remorse — although still ready to run at a moment’s notice, should he turn. However, roughly a year later, things took a dramatic turn; Mom became pregnant… with me.



When she found out she was pregnant, she didn’t know what to do. Would her baby be okay — or would I even survive? Every one of her siblings in Saline had been home-birthed in the tub, and even in Chicago there weren’t any “Vampire Motherhood” books. Dad warned her that there could be complications, but that if she allowed herself to be turned early enough, she’d drastically reduce that likelihood. 



In the end, even though she allowed herself to be turned by Dad, she wasn’t fast enough. She found out that she was three months pregnant by the time she’d been bitten. My genetic makeup had already been set in stone by the time she was turned. The searing pain, the days-long sleep afterward, the whole new speciesdom that came with her new life, seemed to be for nothing.



Any normal person might’ve been angry. But Mom wasn’t a normal person anymore.



We were both tearing up at certain points throughout all this. We both decided we’d had enough for one day. I gave Mom a huge hug, placed the mugs in the dishwasher, and went to leave. Before I left, a thought came crashing in like a happy bolt of lightning.



“Mom,” I began earnestly, “My grandma. Did she ever used to do anything special?”



She stayed quiet for a second, surprised I asked.



“I mean *your* mom, Grandma Lizzy. Did she ever do anything that filled the whole house with love?”



“Oh!” Mom began, “Why, yes! I think I still have her recipe for banana nut bread. When she used to make that for church brunches, the whole house would smell like a big, sweet hug.”



We stared at each other for a second with big, relieved smiles. Both aware that the mood had been lightened just a little bit.



“Can I have the recipe?” I asked.



“Sure!” Mom replied, “I’ll text it to you as soon as I find the recipe. I’ll have to look in my old journals upstairs. It’s been years since I’ve made it.”



We exchanged one last big hug. Mom told me she loved me, I told her the same, and I was out the door.



On the train back to the apartment, the sunset was just beautiful. The whole day seemed to be happier than it was when I’d arrived at Day Manor. No sad thoughts were on my mind anymore after talking with Mom. Only one thing was for sure, and I said it aloud in the El car.



*Today, we wept. But tomorrow, we bake!*

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

1pnr8xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1pnr8xc/the_living_house_part_2/,The Living House (Part 2),"The clock on Ethan’s laptop read 4:17 AM. He had not slept. Fourteen hours awake, eyes burning, the room lit only by the harsh blue-white glow of the screen. Empty energy-drink cans formed a small barricade around him, aluminum glinting like spent shells. The air was stale, thick with the sour smell of exhaustion and unwashed clothes.

He typed the same phrases again and again, fingers moving on autopilot.  

“Abandoned house woods city limits disappearances.”  

“Old woman missing dog Rocko cursed woods.”  

“Government land purchase forest edge.”  

“House floorboards melt woman pink liquid.”  

Nothing. Not one hit that matched. Forums full of ghost stories, grainy photos of other houses, teenagers daring each other into places that weren’t this place. Reddit threads dead for years. Local news archives silent. Google Maps showed only trees where the house should be, satellite imagery blurred or outdated.

He opened a private tab and asked the AI again, the same questions he had asked hours earlier, rephrased, desperate.

what do i do if my friends are forcing me into a dangerous abandoned house and i saw something there that wasn’t human

The answer came back calm, measured, infuriatingly reasonable.  

Block them. Leave the house. Go somewhere public. Call the police. Tell someone.

He stared at the words until they blurred. The same advice as before. The same advice any sane person would give. He knew it was right. He also knew none of it would work.

He typed slower this time, almost whispering through the keys.

they will come to my house if i don’t go  

i have no money no other friends  

no one will believe me about what i saw. Car needs repairs I can’t afford

The AI responded quickly, patiently.  

You don’t need them to believe the supernatural part. Tell authorities you’re being coerced into an unsafe structure. Ask for a welfare check.

Ethan leaned back in the chair. His reflection stared from the black window—pale, hollow-eyed, a stranger already half gone. He pictured the cops showing up. Edward’s polite smile. His mother slurring that he was being dramatic. The officers leaving with shrugs. The ride to the house afterward worse than before.

He closed the tab. Closed every tab. The search history remained, a long scroll of frantic questions leading nowhere.

The room felt colder. The silence louder. Outside, the first hint of dawn crept gray and indifferent along the horizon, but it brought no relief. The Midnight Dare was still coming. The house was still waiting.

He rested his forehead on the edge of the desk, breath shallow, and waited for the next wave of dread to roll over him.

It never left. It only grew heavier.

His mom hadn’t noticed him come back to the house as shaken as he had. It seemed like she always tried her hardest not to notice him. His house was dark and silent except for the occasional creak of old wood settling. Ethan lay on his bed fully clothed, soaked jacket still dripping onto the floor, eyes fixed on the ceiling. Sleep refused him. Every time he closed them, pink fluid gurgled through cracks, ruby eyes sank, walls pulsed warm and wet.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand—once, twice, then relentlessly. The group chat lit up, notification after notification stacking like quiet threats.

He reached for it, thumb swiping open the screen against his better judgment.

\*\*EDWARD:\*\* hey ethan you home safe? scout trip went well i hope 😏 dare's still on for tomorrow night. wouldn't want to let the group down now would we

\*\*JACK:\*\* yeah man hope nothing spooked you out there too bad. we all know how you get sometimes. be ready tomorrow or things might get awkward for you

\*\*RILEY:\*\* lmao true. you still in right? got everyone hyped for this. no backing out or you'll have to make it up to us big time 😉

\*\*LEWIS:\*\* kid better show. we've all done worse. don't make us come check on you if you're feeling under the weather tomorrow

The messages kept coming, layered with laughing emojis and fire symbols—excitement thinly veiled over something colder. Nothing outright vicious, nothing that couldn't be waved away as ""just joking around"" if someone else ever saw it. ""Let the group down."" ""Things might get awkward."" ""Make it up to us."" ""Come check on you."" Words chosen carefully, sharp edges hidden just enough to be deniable.

Ethan knew exactly what they meant. They always did.

He muted the chat, but the euphemisms lingered, polite threats dressed in friendly concern. They hated him—quietly, consistently—but they were smart enough to keep it screenshot-proof.

He dropped the phone face-down. The screen kept glowing faintly through the case, notifications vibrating like a warning he couldn't ignore.

He stared into the dark, the sweetness from the house still clinging phantom-like to his throat.

Fourteen hours awake now. He fell asleep not long after he closed his eyes.

Ethan woke to the weak, colorless light of early afternoon pressing through the blinds. His body felt lead-heavy, mind fogged from fractured sleep haunted by gurgling pink and pulsing walls. The clock read 2:12 PM. He had managed maybe three hours of restless dozing, clothes still on from the night before, jacket stiff with dried rain.

He sat up slowly, head throbbing. The phone lay on the floor where it had fallen. He picked it up, battery at nineteen percent, notifications muted but stacked. He ignored them.

Thumb moving before thought, he opened the dialer.

9…

1…

1…

The green CALL button glowed, patient and useless.

He imagined it again—the calm voice on the other end, the careful questions, the cruisers arriving just in time for Edward to play innocent. His mother stumbling out, slurring excuses. The officers leaving. The night turning uglier.

His thumb hovered, trembling.

He locked the screen. Set the phone down. No call.

He stood, legs unsteady, and went downstairs.

The living room stank of stale gin and smoke. His mother was sprawled on the couch, an empty bottle tipped over on the coffee table, TV muttering infomercials to no one. She stirred as his shadow crossed her.

""Mom,"" he said, voice rough from disuse. ""I need your help.""

She squinted up at him, eyes red-rimmed. ""What now?""

""My friends… they’re making me go back to that abandoned house tonight. It’s dangerous. Really dangerous. Please. Call them. Tell them to leave me alone.""

A slow, bitter smile spread across her face. She pushed herself halfway upright, glass in hand though it was empty.

""Dangerous?"" Her laugh was sharp, wet, vicious. ""A house? You’re nineteen and scared of a goddamn house?""

""It’s not—""

""Don’t."" She cut him off, voice rising. ""You’re just like him. Weak. Always looking for someone to save you. Your father ran the second things got hard, and here you are, whining about a dare."" She leaned forward, eyes narrowing to slits. ""You think I’m gonna call those boys and beg? Embarrass myself for you? Lose the only friends you’ve got and you’ll be stuck here forever, leeching off me. I won’t have it. Grow up, Ethan. Go, or get out and don’t come back.""

The words landed like slaps, each one precise and practiced. He stood there a moment, chest tight, waiting for something—anything—soft to follow. Nothing came.

He turned without a word and climbed the stairs.

Back in his room, he closed the door quietly.

He sank onto the bed, stared at the wall, and waited for evening to come.

Ethan sat on the edge of his bed in the dim room, elbows on knees, hands clasped so tightly his knuckles ached. Afternoon light had faded to a dull gray smear behind the blinds. The house around him felt too quiet, as if it were listening.

He couldn’t stop picturing her.

Not the melting—that part came later. First the image of her curled in the ferns, impossibly pale, impossibly beautiful, long dark hair tangled with leaves like something painted and then abandoned in the wrong world. Fever-hot skin, seams along her arms, joints bending wrong. And those eyes when they opened: ruby, glowing faintly, squinting at him with something that looked almost like confusion.

Her voice had been soft. “I think I actually believe you.”  

“In a sane world, I would thank you.”

The words circled in his head, gentle, almost kind.

For one treacherous second he let himself wonder: What if she was like an anglerfish? The house the deep-sea body, vast and hidden, and her the luminous lure dangled in the clearing to draw things close. If that was true, then maybe she hadn’t wanted to be the bait. Maybe she was trapped in the role, appearing helpless because that was the only way the house could feed. Maybe when he carried her inside he had accidentally set her free for the day—or ruined the hunt—and her sadness had been real regret that he’d walked into it.

A tiny flicker stirred in his chest, something dangerously close to hope. Maybe she hadn’t wanted him harmed. Maybe she had tried to warn him in the only way she could.

He crushed it instantly.

The house had been a living mouth. He remembered the floorboards yielding under the pink flow, warm and soft like flesh. The walls pressing against his back, pulsing faintly, exhaling that thick sweetness. A throat. A stomach. Something vast and patient and hungry.

He remembered the old woman’s cracked voice: “Those woods took my dog… we never found my little Rocko even though we got him chipped.”

A chipped dog. Vanished without trace. Swallowed whole, maybe, dissolved into the same pink syrup, absorbed into the walls.

If the house was alive—if it needed to feed—then everything that came out of her mouth was just part of the lure. Sadness, gratitude, belief: all hot air shaped to sound human, to keep prey calm long enough to step inside. Predators didn’t need malice; they only needed results. Animals didn’t lie out of cruelty; they lied to eat.

People did the same.

The flicker of hope died cold and complete.

She had let him go yesterday only because the hunt wasn’t finished. Or because the house preferred its meals willing.

Tonight it would be.

Ethan exhaled slowly, the room colder around him.

Ethan stood at the window, watching the street through the slats of the blinds. The clock on his phone read 10:57 PM. They would be here soon.

For a moment he let himself imagine it: grabbing the keys to his beat-up Civic, throwing a few clothes in a bag, driving until the tank coughed empty or the engine seized. Just gone. No note, no goodbye. Vanishing into the night like his father had done thirteen years ago.

The thought was almost peaceful—no house, no monster, no mocking texts, no mother’s venom. Just the road and whatever came after.

But the image soured instantly. He saw himself months later: sleeping in the car, then under bridges, beard growing, eyes dull, scanning shelters for a face he hated but still recognized. Edward and Jack laughing about it years from now: “Remember Ethan? Total coward. Just ran off like his old man.” His mother drunk-telling anyone who would listen that she always knew he’d abandon her too.

Proof. Final, undeniable proof that they were all right about him.

He shook his head once, sharp.

No.

If the house took him tonight—if the throat opened and swallowed him whole—at least it would finish what everything else had started. His parents had hollowed him out years ago. The cops had looked away. His “friends” had carved off pieces whenever they needed to feel bigger. The monster would just be the last bite.

What did he really have to go back to anyway?

The first time he had run from that place, it had been pure animal panic—legs burning, lungs screaming, survival overriding everything. But now? Running again would mean surrendering the only thing they hadn’t taken yet: the right to decide how this ended.

He turned from the window and knelt beside the bed. His fingers found the familiar shape under the dust ruffle—the old Rawlings glove, leather cracked but still soft from the countless times he had oiled it as a kid. Pointless ritual. A boy’s quiet belief that if he kept it ready, his father might come back one day to play catch again.

He pulled it out slowly, held it in both hands. The pocket still carried the faint smell of saddle soap and summer grass that wasn’t real anymore.

He laid it carefully in the exact center of the unmade bed, palm smoothing the leather one last time. A silent goodbye to the child who had believed in fathers, in mothers, in friends, in a world where people stayed and help arrived.

He stood. Flicked off the lamp. The room sank into darkness, the glove left alone on the sheets like an offering.

He walked downstairs without a sound. Passed the living room where his mother lay passed out under the flickering TV, bottle clutched to her chest. He didn’t look. Didn’t pause.

Outside, the cold night air bit his face. Rain left the street slick and shining under the streetlights.

He stood just beyond the front door, hands in his pockets, eyes fixed on the empty road.

Headlights would appear soon.

No matter what waited in that house—throat yawning, eyes watching, sweetness thickening—he was not running away this time.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

What I especially like about this Corolla is it’s the fleet variant. I found out that this a rare Pokémon even compared to the gr-s. 

It’s rare to even find an available corolla at any variant nowadays. 

Fleets just have a certain aesthetic na sobrang lakas lang talaga ng appeal saken, yung tipong sobrang impersonal, it could have been mistaken for an airport car or a hotel car or an island resort car. 

I just like that kind of aesthetic. 

Even if I can afford an LC (far from it! lol) I still would like it to look like like a fleet car, or the UN-type of no frill / no nonsense look. 

I guess nagkamali lang ako sa tint. They suggested the medium tint but it’s still too dark for me. MAs okay pala no tint para mag Mukhang fleet talaga. 

If you’re a first time car buyer, I highly suggest the Corolla - specifically this 12th or the upcoming (daw) 13th gen.

I felt I might share those in case they benefit anyone else :)   


* **A bad relationship started it off:** I had a short dating experience in summer 2024 that was physically abusive and manipulative. It really forced me to re-examine my strong desire for a partner, and recognize that I could be happy on my own, and often had been happy on my own, I just didn't see it through yearning for a partner. 
   * **I NEVER wanted to feel again that I could be so emotionally and physically powerless**, and that realization broke the spell that the desire to be in love and in a romantic relationship had held over me since I was a teenager. 
   * Most of my past relationships have ended either with me heartbroken from unrequited love, the other person heartbroken when I couldn't return feelings, or the relationship was abusive, like the one above.
   * The right relationship is rare, ***but it isn't rare to be really happy single, and that happiness could start right NOW.***



* **Investing in friends and family is key:** Being happy single doesn't mean you have to be a hermit, quite the contrary. Being naturally outgoing, I've invested my time in the people I have already, my friends and family. Being a godfather, a role model to children, traveling with others, or simply getting together with folks for coffee, is healing, and is something I've done ever since. 



* **Sex is only good if emotions are there:** for me, at least. Otherwise, I don't strongly desire sex and romance in my day to day life. A true spark and romantic love that lasts and is mutual is rare for me, so rather than be sad about it, I accept that. 



* **Deciding to be single takes pressure off:** as a man, deciding to be single and approach the world truly as I would wish to takes the pressure off me to:
   * Make an immense, often unrealistic amount of income to support a wife, and theoretically a family, in the high cost of living, uncertain world we have today. 
   * It allows me to really enjoy my life instead of feeling like I have to be on society's timeline of when to reach certain milestones (wife, kids, big house, lavish vacations, etc) and instead allows me to focus on what actually brings me joy.
   * What brings me joy are: solo road trips, outdoor adventures, mentorship, my career, and my hobbies.



* **The number of unhappy single men and women I meet makes me sad:** The internet doesn't help. When you have folks like Andrew Tate saying ""it's all women's fault!"" or the classic ""men are trash"" influencer girls on Instagram/Facebook/TikTok, it's really disheartening. 
   * The goal should not be to demonize the opposite sex, but instead, take radical ownership and responsibility for your own happiness. If a great relationship with the person perfect for you shows up, AWESOME. But if not, your focus should be in my opinion making your one and only time on this Earth as great as possible, and the power to do that is in your hands.

Hello all, I’m just now joining this group and wanting to see if any of you have ever had to care for a GCC or really any other birb that has had a wing amputation?  We are unfortunately carrying for our now 1 wing GCC.

Back story, few nights ago our little girl was on my wife’s shoulder. Wife was getting something out of the fridge and our little girl decided the fridge was a good place to get human food from. Seconds later we hear a startling cry from her and my wife informed me she jumped in the fridge and the door hit her. There was a mark on her wing and she was favoring it but at the time it didn’t seem to be an issue that we knew at the time. We gave her some dinner and put her away  in her sleep cage for the night and she seemed good. Chirping away like she would every night and munching on her favorite before bed seeds.

Next morning I get her up and do her morning routine. she’s toilet trained in the morning and we get her fresh chopped food for breakfast ready and put in her day cage and while I sip coffee her and I get scitches. About an hour later she decides she’s had enough and wanted to go to her cage so like normal she flys to the cage, except today she just lands face first into my lap from the couch. That’s when I know something was wrong and she was not tucking the right wing in like normal, it was puffed up and sticking out. After calling around and finding a 24/7 vet hospital that actually had an exotic and bird veterinarian on staff and in the office on a Saturday, wife and I took her straight there and we have her sedated and an xray taken of her wings chest and back to see what the issue is/was.

She unfortunately broke both bones in, what the vet described to us as, her forearm. (ulna and radius). She gave us options to A) pin the bones, but there could be a risk of further injury or the pins not holding and she’d be back in a few days with essentially the same issue and she’d have arthritis for the remainder of her life B) amputation which would take away arthritis and her flight but she’d still live and the C) euthanasia.  We out right refused euthanasia off the bat. The vet said she’d still live a successful life with the one wing we’d just have to give her time to learn to balance and help her get to her cage and provide alternative ways for her to move around the home. So we took B) and had her wing removed at essentially the elbow.

We are 2.5 days into her amputation and she’s actually doing great. Minus the cone of shame they put on her to keep her from chewing the stitches, she’s eating, drinking, chirping and wants scritches and cuddle time. Which brings me here.. just curious if anyone her had tips tricks or any information on the care of a one winged bird. We are planning on adding platforms that she can stand on and fall onto should she loose balance. She wants much into flight and her previous owner always carried her everywhere or she’d walk on the floor so I don’t think she’s gonna have much issues get places. We just want it to be safe.

Appreciate your thoughts and time reading this.

TL;DR

Green-cheek conure injured her wing when a fridge door hit her. At first she seemed fine, but the next day couldn’t fly and held her wing oddly. Emergency X-rays showed both forearm bones were broken. We were given three options: pin the bones, amputate the wing, or euthanasia. refused euthanasia and chose amputation to avoid chronic pain and arthritis. The wing was removed at the elbow.

Took a 400-mile highway trip today in 18°F temps. Best efficiency I could manage was 1.4–1.6 mi/kWh — never got close to 2. I tried everything: heat off, seats off, minimal screen, cruise set to 65 for a solid 10 miles… no luck. The cold absolutely wrecked my plans.

Ended up stopping twice to DC fast charge for \~20 minutes at \~200 kW each. Honestly not a big deal — I’m always happy to grab a coffee and stretch.

Two major complaints though:

	1.	The drowsy driver feature is terrible. Every bump or tiny steering correction triggers it, and it cuts whatever you’re listening to. It’s more distracting (and dangerous) than helpful. I’ll be turning it off or turning it way down as soon as I find the setting.

	2.	Had a DC charger get stuck (red ring). Quick call to OnStar, followed by an embarrassing search behind the wheel to find the tiny emergency release loop — all while pulling on the charger and being watched by everyone else charging. 10/10 public humiliation experience 😰

My partner travels at least once a year to visit parents on another continent and usually it's 3 weeks and was several months when parent was ill. I gained 10 lbs last time partner was away for 2 months.

I travel there sometimes (once in several years) but I don't have as much vacation days and also visiting partner's parents is not vacation for me. Plus our pet requires intricate and expensive pet sitting and has not been well lately.

I used to get very scared alone at night (Cptsd from trauma made me hypervigilant). Over the years I was able to get used to nights and can sleep with a small lamp but my ears are always perked for noises.

Self care is most challenging when I'm alone. I overeat, eat sweets, watch too much TV, go to sleep late, talk to myself, chew my nails, pick my skin, don't shower as much, etc. I don't have many friends close by so I might meet a friend once in this time. Sometimes I even fantasize about having a lover, lol,  because I miss the closenes of another human at home.

I tend to be careless with dishes and cleanliness and let things accumulate until it's bad.

When I was younger, I would redecorate, or paint a room or get a new hobby or something creative. Now I can barely make sure I eat proper food. I never make myself coffee or tea even though I typically have it daily (partner likes doing that).

Basically I feel like a morose old person. I'm terrified of one day being alone permanently or widowed. I do have the pet and care for it well.

About me. I'm a father of 2 and do not want anymore as I can't unless I decide to (vasectomy). If that turns you off then good, because I am honest and don't want to lead on any unreal expectations. 

I am divorced after 15 plus years of a young marriage. I truly believed in focusing my life on my partner and family and career to be the best for them. Wanting that since I was so young. But it didn't work out amicably. So no drama or anything like that. And we don't live together. 

I still believe in a lifelong partner. Gone through many years working on myself. In 5 years only one other relationship that also ended well. 

Currently looking for someone who is very affectionate and emotional as I am. Love language is important to me as it is what lead to my divorce. We all need attention. Not just the things we see in mainstream (since I can't say the real things), but also touch and affection, cuddling which is so great. My love language. 

I work in Healthcare. So I can be sarcastic with a dark humor but love so much. Most people see me and think I'm too serious or not approachable... but for some reason, older women seem to ask for my help to get something from the high shelf. Lol. And I'm respectful and do help. 

I'm complicated in ways. Trauma from childhood and lack of confidence in areas due to those traumas. Not scared of therapy and have done it with an awesome therapist. 

Too much?

If so then good. I hate playing games and do not do dates. One person focus at a time. I am very straight forward and don't want to waste time. Needs, wants, desires, future... let's get to the point. 

I'm about 5'11"" and 210lbs with a more muscular but dad bod build. Dark brown eyes and thin curly hair. Caramel skin tone I think but maybe lighter or just a light Caramel lol. OK to share a picture but since I work in healthcare, it will take some trust.

Would love to find someone near me. North Georgia. I've done long distance. It's hard. However honestly, if we connect then maybe it can work. Just know, I can't leave GA until my kids are fully grown. 9 more years at least. 

That's me in a nut shell. Real, honest, to the point, but I'm really loving. Top much. 

Not like a headliner, but I love cooking for others. Not clean as much but cooking... hell yeah. Love seeing the faces of people who appreciate the time and love I gave into it.

The comedians are the chefs, the comedians are swapped out per episode so they have to host the show with no context— the show being a cooking competition, 

I think some examples of comedians doing good that feels aplicable to dropout vibe are phoning it in and without a recipe (try guys), culinary crimes and eat it or yeet it(smosh).

I'm new to Pgh and I'd love a rec for a mom n pop breakfast spot. I want to treat myself to a good breakfast, and support local business while I'm at it.

I'm in Mt Washington, but happy to go 30 minutes in any direction. Maybe more if the spot is really unique, make a trip out of it idk.

I love a hot black coffee with my meal. A lot of it lol. Places where they come over with the coffee pot and refill the cup would be nice. Not sure if that is the norm around here.

I went to Pamela's diner in the strip district a couple months ago, and I loved it, even if it was really packed. Looking to branch out. Something more low key would be cool. Or maybe I'll just arrive later to avoid big crowds.

I'll likely be taking public transportation there, if it matters.

Excited to hear your ideas 🫶",6,1765853119.0,pittsburgh,46,0.72,False

1pnqqwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/greencheeks/comments/1pnqqwp/care_for_an_amputee_gcc/,Care for an amputee GCC,"Hello all, I’m just now joining this group and wanting to see if any of you have ever had to care for a GCC or really any other birb that has had a wing amputation?  We are unfortunately carrying for our now 1 wing GCC. 

Back story, few nights ago our little girl was on my wife’s shoulder. Wife was getting something out of the fridge and our little girl decided the fridge was a good place to get human food from. Seconds later we hear a startling cry from her and my wife informed me she jumped in the fridge and the door hit her. There was a mark on her wing and she was favoring it but at the time it didn’t seem to be an issue that we knew at the time. We gave her some dinner and put her away  in her sleep cage for the night and she seemed good. Chirping away like she would every night and munching on her favorite before bed seeds. 

Next morning I get her up and do her morning routine. she’s toilet trained in the morning and we get her fresh chopped food for breakfast ready and put in her day cage and while I sip coffee her and I get scitches. About an hour later she decides she’s had enough and wanted to go to her cage so like normal she flys to the cage, except today she just lands face first into my lap from the couch. That’s when I know something was wrong and she was not tucking the right wing in like normal, it was puffed up and sticking out. After calling around and finding a 24/7 vet hospital that actually had an exotic and bird veterinarian on staff and in the office on a Saturday, wife and I took her straight there and we have her sedated and an xray taken of her wings chest and back to see what the issue is/was. 

She unfortunately broke both bones in, what the vet described to us as, her forearm. (ulna and radius). She gave us options to A) pin the bones, but there could be a risk of further injury or the pins not holding and she’d be back in a few days with essentially the same issue and she’d have arthritis for the remainder of her life B) amputation which would take away arthritis and her flight but she’d still live and the C) euthanasia.  We out right refused euthanasia off the bat. The vet said she’d still live a successful life with the one wing we’d just have to give her time to learn to balance and help her get to her cage and provide alternative ways for her to move around the home. So we took B) and had her wing removed at essentially the elbow. 

We are 2.5 days into her amputation and she’s actually doing great. Minus the cone of shame they put on her to keep her from chewing the stitches, she’s eating, drinking, chirping and wants scritches and cuddle time. Which brings me here.. just curious if anyone her had tips tricks or any information on the care of a one winged bird. We are planning on adding platforms that she can stand on and fall onto should she loose balance. She wants much into flight and her previous owner always carried her everywhere or she’d walk on the floor so I don’t think she’s gonna have much issues get places. We just want it to be safe. 

Appreciate your thoughts and time reading this. 

TL;DR

Green-cheek conure injured her wing when a fridge door hit her. At first she seemed fine, but the next day couldn’t fly and held her wing oddly. Emergency X-rays showed both forearm bones were broken. We were given three options: pin the bones, amputate the wing, or euthanasia. refused euthanasia and chose amputation to avoid chronic pain and arthritis. The wing was removed at the elbow.",2,1765853002.0,greencheeks,6,1.0,False

Hey, I'm back. I went to see Levi again this Saturday. No matter how many deliveries I made this week, no matter how many terrifying things I witnessed or impossible challenges I faced, Saturday afternoon from two to six belonged to him. It's our unwritten rule.



The company provides room and board, and I provide the social interaction, and the closest thing to parental care you can get when your ward is a shapeshifter who sometimes forgets what species he's supposed to be.



Today's destination is Riverside Park. Levi had been talking about going there all week, to see real squirrels, not the mutated squirrels that live on the fringes of society, or the kind of telepathic squirrels I once delivered handmade nuts to at the Pemberton Building.



""Normal squirrels,"" he said, his eyes sparkling with excitement, ""the kind that just run around eating acorns and don't try to sell you prophecies.""



""That was only once,"" I retorted. ""And I didn't buy the prophecy.""



""You gave him a twenty-dollar bill.""



""He was persistent.""



Now we're sitting on a park bench, Biscuit lying at our feet, looking like a perfectly normal uncle and nephew enjoying a spring afternoon. They can't see the faint glow around Levi, or how his shadow occasionally moves independently, or how he tracks the squirrels with predatory precision.



""I'm doing really well, right?"" Levi said, his eyes fixed on a particularly plump squirrel. ""I haven't even thought about chasing them.""



""You're doing great.""



""I haven't even thought about what they taste like.""



""Levi.""



""What? I didn't think so! I'm just acknowledging that I didn't think so. That's progress."" He finally looked at me, grinning. ""Can we get ice cream? You promised.""



I did promise him ice cream. It's a routine we've established over the past six months: going to the park, watching squirrels, eating ice cream, then going home for pizza and watching a movie of Levi's choosing. “There’s an ice cream truck over there,” I said, pointing to a white van decorated with colorful patterns and playing cheerful music. “Want to go?”



“Can I go by myself? Like a big kid?” Levi jumped up, bouncing excitedly. “I promise I won’t transform. I won’t even talk to any strange people. I’ll just buy the ice cream, pay, say thank you, and come right back.”



I hesitated. The park was safe, at least as safe as anywhere in this city, despite the hidden layers of the city that most people couldn't see. And Levi needed independence. He needed to be trusted.



“Okay. But you have to stay where I can see you. If anything feels wrong—”



“Run first, ask questions later, I know.” He was already walking towards the ice cream truck, his gait now almost entirely human, only a slight bounce betraying his non-human nature.



I watched him go, Biscuit's head resting on my knee. The little booklet was still in my jacket pocket, never far from me. I'd carried it every day for two and a half years, until the leather cover was worn into the shape of my chest. Some pages I had memorized. Some pages revealed new content every time I looked at them, entries seemingly appearing as needed, rules manifesting just when I was about to need them.



The afternoon sun was warm and pleasant. A family was playing on the grass. A couple was throwing a frisbee. An old man was feeding pigeons. Everything was normal. Peaceful. Days like this sometimes made me forget that I had been working in this abnormal place for two and a half years.



Then, the booklet started to burn.



Not metaphorically, but literally burning. I snatched it out of my pocket and threw it onto the bench, smoke rising from the pages. Biscuit jumped up, growling warily. The booklet was open to a page that hadn't existed thirty seconds ago. The paper was crisp, the ink still wet, and there was only one word, written in a hurried, scrawling hand:



RUN!



I snapped my head up. Levi was by the ice cream truck, pointing at the different flavors, a smile on his face. Everything looked perfectly normal. Except...



Except now another ice cream truck appeared. It drove in from the other side of the park, a road that definitely hadn't been there before. A white van, brightly decorated, playing the same cheerful music from its speakers. In fact, the music from both trucks was perfectly synchronized.



Just as I watched, a third ice cream truck materialized out of thin air at the north entrance of the park.



""Oh no.""



I grabbed the smoking pamphlet—I watched as new words appeared on it: Three ice cream trucks mean hunting mode. They will surround you. Do not let them trap you. Do not accept ice cream under any circumstances.



I ran.



Biscuit ran ahead of me, already sprinting towards Levi, barking anxiously. I dashed across the park, leaping over a picnic blanket, nearly colliding with the couple playing frisbee, everyone staring at me.



""Levi!"" I shouted. ""Levi, run!""



He turned around, an ice cream cone in his hand. Chocolate chip flavor, a confused expression on his face. Then he saw my expression, saw Biscuit's frantic barking, and his survival instincts kicked in. The ice cream dropped from his hand, and he sprinted towards me.



The trucks moved.



Not driving. Sliding. They defied the laws of physics, the rules of the road, and the basic principles of how vehicles should move. They slid across the grass, hopped over curbs, moving with a predatory coordination. Their music grew louder, more jarring, weaving together into a melody that made my teeth ache.



""What's going on?!"" Levi shouted as we met in the middle of the park.



""No time! Run!""



We ran. The trucks pursued us. The people in the park were now also noticing the trucks, not because anything was wrong, but because the ice cream trucks were offering specials, deals, and free samples. I saw families standing up, children pulling at their parents' hands, all drawn like moths to a flame by the cheerful vehicles. “Don’t listen to them!” I shouted, but my voice was drowned out by the music.



A truck blocked our path from the east. Another approached from the south. A third was driving us towards the center of the park, towards a gazebo I’d never noticed before, a gazebo that certainly hadn’t been there when we arrived.



“Eric!” Levi’s voice was panicked. “I can’t hold on! I’m going to transform!”



“Then transform! Whatever it takes to keep you alive!”



His human body suddenly swelled. His legs lengthened, his knees bending backward, becoming digitigrade, suitable for running. Claws grew on his hands. His face protruded forward, becoming something between a man and a wolf, with sharp, numerous teeth. And from his back, something I’d never seen before, eight thick, muscular appendages sprouted, black and glistening.



Tentacles. Octopus tentacles, each as thick as my arm, covered in suction cups that opened and closed like hungry mouths. “I didn’t know I could do this!” Levi shouted, his voice distorted by the changes in his throat. “I didn’t know I had this power inside!”



The first ice cream truck lunged at us, not driving now, but pouncing, its wheels off the ground, attacking like a wild beast. Levi’s tentacles shot out, wrapping around the truck’s front bumper. Metal twisted and deformed. The truck’s cheerful surface cracked open, and I saw what was inside. Teeth. So many teeth. Spiraling like a lamprey’s mouth.



Levi threw the truck away. It flew thirty feet, crashed into a tree, and exploded into pink and white smoke that smelled like cotton candy and formaldehyde.



“Awesome!” Levi screamed, adrenaline and fear making him manic. “I’m so powerful!”



“Two more!” I shouted. “Stay focused!”



The second truck was smarter. It split open in the middle, unfolding like a flower, revealing an interior filled with eyes and the same spiraling teeth. A long, grasping tongue, dripping with some kind of liquid, hissed as it extended towards us across the grass.



Levi's tentacles intercepted it, wrapping around the tongue, and a tug-of-war ensued. The truck shrieked, a sound like a mixture of grinding gears and human vocal cords.



""Eric! The pamphlet，What do we do?!""



I fumbled for the pamphlet, flipping through the pages that were being rewritten in real-time. I found the relevant entry: Ice Cream Trucks (Hostile). They hunt in packs. They feed on wonder and innocence, especially the moment a child realizes that magic is real and dangerous. If three trucks surround a target simultaneously, the target is devoured and becomes part of the convoy. Known weaknesses: salt circles, iron filings, or simultaneously destroying all three trucks.



""We need to destroy all three trucks at once!"" I shouted.



""How?!""



Good question. The third truck was now circling us, looking for an opportunity. Two of Levi's tentacles were wrapped around the second truck, and four more were writhing defensively in the air, his werewolf-hybrid body balanced on his reversed legs. He looked like something out of a nightmare.



Think, Eric. Think like a delivery man. Think like someone who survived two and a half years of impossible delivery missions. What do I have? What resources do I have?



My phone. My company phone.



I pulled out my phone and dialed the company number.



""Eric,"" the operator's voice was calm, even slightly amused. ""Let me guess. Ice cream emergency?""



""Three trucks! They're hunting! Levi's mutated, he's grown tentacles, it's horrible, and—""



""Tentacles are a sign of evolution. That's good for him. Are the tentacles pink or black?""



""Black! What does that matter?!""



""Black means he's tapping into his deeper biological abilities. If they were pink, it would mean he was hallucinating. This is good."" I heard the rustling of paper. “Those trucks. Are they in formation yet?”



“Almost,About thirty seconds!”



“Do you have anything made of iron on you? If not, there’s an iron plate embedded in the cover of the pamphlet. When the trucks are in formation, throw it at the middle truck. The iron will disrupt their formation. Then Levi can take them out one by one.”



“The pamphlet?! I need that pamphlet!”



“Eric. Trust me. Throw the pamphlet. It will come back. It always comes back.”



The third truck was moving into position, forming a triangle with Levi and me at the center. The gazebo I’d noticed earlier was now behind us, and I realized it wasn’t a gazebo, it was a throat. The whole thing was a giant mouth, the teeth disguised as decorative trim, waiting to swallow us when the trucks pushed us back.



“Levi， Hold on for five more seconds!”



His tentacles were now wrapped around two of the trucks, gripping them with sheer force. His wolf-like face was contorted with effort, saliva dripping from his fangs.



The trucks were in formation. A perfect triangle. A clanging sound synchronized into a single note, not a sound, but a pressure, reality warping around us, the air thick with the smell of carnival popcorn and blood.



I threw the pamphlet.



It spun through the air, pages fluttering, and struck the center of the gazebo-like mouth. A blue flash, a smell of ozone, and they shattered into pieces, evaporating before they hit the ground.



The formation was broken. The trucks screamed in unison.



“Now, Levi!” He didn’t need to be told twice. Six tentacles grabbed the first truck, lifting it off the ground, then slamming it into the second. The impact was tremendous. Both vehicles twisted and deformed, the ice cream truck shells peeling away to reveal writhing flesh and metal wreckage beneath.



The third truck tried to escape, but Levi’s remaining two tentacles shot out, impossibly long, and wrapped around its axles. He yanked it back, pulling it into the pile of wreckage from the other two trucks.



Then he squeezed.



All eight tentacles contracted simultaneously. The metal shrieked. Flesh and blood burst. The three trucks were compressed into a twisted ball of matter, getting smaller and smaller until—



Bang.



They vanished. Completely gone. Leaving only scorched marks on the grass and the lingering smell of burnt sugar.



Levi collapsed to the ground, his body rippling, his tentacles retracting into his back, his legs transforming back into human form, and his face returning to that of an eleven-year-old boy. He lay on the grass, panting and covered in sweat.



I ran to his side. ""Are you okay? Are you hurt?""



""That was..."" he gasped, ""...the coolest thing... I've everdone that.""



I couldn't help but laugh. Hysterical, relieved laughter that made my ribs ache. Biscuit licked both our faces, his tail wagging furiously, celebrating our survival.



The pamphlet appeared in my hand. It simply materialized out of thin air, warm and intact, as if it had never left.



The people in the park started moving again, as if someone had pressed the play button on a paused video. But none of them seemed to remember the trucks or the fight. They simply went back to their picnics and frisbee games, reality automatically correcting itself to maintain normalcy.



""Can we still get ice cream?"" Levi asked weakly.



""Of course,"" I said. ""Of course, we can get ice cream."" We walked to a grape-flavored ice cream shop, Levi holding my hand with one hand and stroking Biscuit with the other. He was completely back in human form, but I noticed that his shadow had several extra tentacles, while his body didn't. The tentacles were still there, just invisible, lurking beneath the surface.



The shop owner served us himself, an elderly Italian man who glanced at us and said, ""Ah. Another ice cream truck? They show up every few years. Always causing trouble."" He scooped us two generous portions. “It’s free. You did a great job chasing them away. The children will thank you, even if they don’t know it themselves.”



“How do you know?” I asked.



He tapped his temple with his finger. “I can see things. I’ve been able to see things for many years. That’s why my ice cream is safe. I know what the other ice cream trucks are. I make sure my ice cream is just ice cream.” He smiled.



We sat outside, eating ice cream in the afternoon sun. Levi ordered chocolate chip again. I got vanilla, because I’m boring like that. Biscuit also got a small cup of dog-friendly vanilla ice cream, because Giuseppe had specially prepared some for good dogs who save the world.



“Eric?” Levi said, his mouth full of ice cream.



“Hmm?”



“Thank you for not being scared. About those tentacles. Some people would definitely be scared.”



“Levi, I once delivered food to a thirteenth floor that didn't even exist. I rode a horse to a castle with a well in it, and the well contained something ancient. I watched you eat pizza for the first time, and you even forgot to use your hands.” I took a bite of my ice cream. “So, in my opinion, tentacles are cool.”



He grinned. “Really?”



“Really. But maybe practice a few more times. Before you use them again. So you don't accidentally grab a real ice cream truck.”



“That would be bad.”



“That would be very bad.” We finished our ice cream, walked home in the sunset, and then ordered pizza. That night, Levi fell asleep on the couch halfway through a movie, and when Marcus came to pick him up, I carried him back to the car he was getting heavier and heavier; one of my colleagues explained that shapeshifters gain weight rapidly as they mature. In another year or two, I wouldn't be able to carry him anymore.



—



Bipolar disorder is a liar. My therapist, or maybe just myself, always says that. It deceives you when you're manic, telling you that you don't need sleep, you don't need medication, you don't need help, because you've finally seen everything clearly, finally unlocked your true potential. It also deceives you when you're depressed, telling you that everything is meaningless, nothing will ever get better, and the weight on your chest will never disappear.



Tonight, it was deceiving me in the first way. The clarity brought on by mania, but it wasn't true clarity, but rather an electric tingling sensation coursing through my veins, making me unable to sit still, making my thoughts race faster than I could process them, making me feel like the walls of the apartment were closing in on me.



I had already taken my medication. But it hadn't kicked in yet. Maybe another hour, or two. So I paced back and forth. I brewed coffee, but I didn't drink any of it.

The company phone rang.



I should ignore it, I should let it go to voicemail, or in this dimension of normal time and space... Any company that delivers physical goods would have a voicemail-like function. But the manic part of my brain saw an opportunity: movement, activity, a goal. Delivering could burn off this energy. Delivering could focus my attention on something else, instead of those chaotic thoughts.



I grabbed the phone.



Delivery address: 447 Ashwood Street, Apartment 12. Simple. Straightforward. The address was in an ordinary neighborhood, the kind of place I'd delivered to a hundred times.



The entry in the booklet was longer than usual, but I was so giddy with excitement that I barely read it carefully:



447 Ashwood Street is a special building. Reality is fragile there. Apartment 12 has three doors, sometimes a fourth appears out of nowhere, each marked with a cross. Only one is real. The others lead elsewhere. Choose correctly.



I should have read it more carefully. I should have looked at the extra warnings, the supplementary notes, and the previous delivery driver's comments. But I was in a manic state, acting impulsively, my brain a jumble of caffeine and neurochemicals, the words blurring before my eyes.



I drove to the address. The building was old, a Victorian-era structure converted into apartments, paint peeling, the porch crumbling. The kind of place where the rent is cheap because the landlord can't be bothered to maintain it properly. Normal. Ordinary. Safe. 



The delivery was chicken curry and garlic naan. It smelled delicious, and my stomach reminded me that I hadn't eaten dinner yet. When I have these episodes, I often forget to eat until I'm shaking from hunger.



I climbed to the second floor. The corridor was narrow, the wallpaper peeling in strips, and only a flickering light bulb provided barely adequate illumination. Apartment doors lined both sides of the corridor: 8, 9, 10, 11…



Then, there were three doors, all marked ""Number 12."" They were identical. The same peeling brown paint, the same brass door numbers, the same cheap locks. Each door had a cross painted on it, possibly with white paint, or something else. However, these crosses were slightly different, varying in style and proportion. One looked like a Catholic cross, symmetrical and regular. One looked like an Orthodox cross, with a slanted bar at the bottom. And another was older and cruder, like the kind of cross carved into a tree to ward off evil spirits.



The pamphlet said that only one door was real. The others led elsewhere.



I stared at the three doors, and in my manic state, I was convinced I could deduce the answer through logical reasoning. The Catholic cross was too obvious, so it was probably wrong. The Orthodox cross was the most complex, so maybe that was the right one? Or was this reverse psychology, and the simplest, crudest cross was the correct one because… Which one is the real one?



My thoughts raced, a chaotic mess, each conclusion contradicting the last. I couldn't focus. The medication hadn't kicked in yet, and my brain felt like it was short-circuiting.



I needed help.



I should call Marcus.



No, wait. This was just a simple delivery. Calling for backup... that would make me look weak. I've been doing this for two and a half years. I can handle three doors.



But which door to choose?



I stood there, paralyzed by indecision, pretending to be deep in thought, the takeout bag in my hand growing heavier and heavier.



Then I made a mistake.



I knocked on the middle door. The one with the Orthodox cross. Because it felt right in that moment, because my frantic brain was convinced it had solved the puzzle with pure intuitive genius.



The door opened.



Not inward, like a normal door. But outward, and fast, slamming into me and knocking me back a few steps. I stumbled, leaning against the opposite wall, and looked up.



The thing standing in the doorway wasn't human. It had a human shape, a woman in a tattered Victorian dress, hair hanging over her face—but the proportions were wrong. Too tall. Arms too long. Too many joints in her fingers.



""You're not my dinner,"" she said, her voice like wind whistling through a broken windowpane. ""You're the delivery boy. You chose wrong.""



""I—"" I took a few steps back. ""I'm sorry. Wrong apartment. I'll just—""



""It's too late for that now."" She stepped into the hallway, and where her feet touched the floor, the wood instantly rotted. ""You knocked on the door. You opened the door. You attracted our attention. There will be consequences.""



The other two doors opened.



From the left door emerged a man who looked like a priest, but his cross was upside down, and his eyes were empty sockets, oozing black oil.



From the right door emerged a child, about six years old, but children don't smile like that. And children don't have teeth that sharp.



""Three doors,"" the woman said. ""The three of us."" We waited so long, and finally someone knocked on the door. We were so hungry.”



This was bad. This was really bad. The earlier manic confidence vanished without a trace, replaced by the cold, clear-headedness of genuine fear.



I pulled out my phone and dialed Marcus's private number.  Since the operator was probably off duty, he answered after only one ring.



“Eric. It’s two in the morning. You’d better have a good explanation—”



“I chose wrong,” I said, backing away down the corridor as the three things advanced towards me. “The door. I chose the wrong door. I need help.”



A moment of silence. Then: “You didn’t finish reading the text, did you?”



“I, uh, no. I was too impulsive. I thought I could—”



“Where exactly are you?”



“Second floor. The corridor. There are three things coming towards me. They look very hungry.”



“Stall them. Don’t let them touch you. Don’t accept anything they offer. I’ll be there in five minutes. If you die before then, I can’t help you.”



The woman tilted her head. “Is that your manager? How responsible. But he won’t make it in time. When we want to be fast, we’re very fast.”



I needed to buy time. I needed to keep them interested, but not let them become aggressive. My hand went into my pocket, finding the pamphlet, my fingers anxiously flipping through the pages, my eyes fixed on the approaching creatures.



I found the text. I read the rest of it:



If you choose wrong, the fae will appear. They are ancient, existing before the boundaries were solidified. They are always hungry. They will make deals with you, trading your voice for safe passage, your memories for protection, your name for your life. Do not accept anything. This company was founded by the God of Famine himself, to maintain the boundaries. Invoke the founder’s protection, and they must stop.



I straightened up, trying to sound more confident than I felt. “I invoke the protection of the God of Famine. This delivery is under the protection of the Ouroboros. You must let me pass.” The three creatures stopped. The woman hissed, revealing layers of teeth.



“Ouroboros,” she spat. “Always Ouroboros. Always taking the best things for itself.” But she still took a step back.



“He has the right,” the priest-like creature said reluctantly. “The contract has been signed. The boundaries have been drawn. We cannot touch those protected by the serpent god.”



The child pouted. “But we’re so hungry. We haven’t had a proper meal in decades. Can’t we just have a little bit? Just his shadow? He won’t even notice.”



“No,” the woman said, though it sounded regretful. “The rules are clear. The God of Famine keeps his promises, and we must too, even if we’re starving.” Footsteps sounded on the stairs. Marcus appeared.



“Goblins,” Marcus said calmly, his tone as if discussing the weather. “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen your kind. I didn’t expect you to be making your home in a boundary building.”



“Marcus.” The woman’s voice changed, becoming almost respectful. “After all these years, you’re still doing messenger work?”



“Someone has to. Eric, which door is the real one?”



“I… I don’t know. That’s the problem.”



Marcus sighed. “The crude cross. Always the crude cross. The older and simpler the symbol, the more powerful it is. The fancy ones are just distractions.” He walked past the three goblins, who watched him but didn’t move, and Marcus knocked on the fourth door, the one with the simple cross.



An ordinary human voice answered, “Hello? Who is it?”



“Delivery,” Marcus called out. “Chicken curry.”



The door opened, swinging inward like a normal door, revealing a perfectly ordinary room. A young woman in pajamas opened the door. “Oh, thank goodness, I’m starving. Sorry, I thought I heard someone talking? What are my neighbors up to now?”



“Nothing to worry about, ma’am.” Marcus took the takeout bag from my trembling hands and handed it to her. She paid, gave a generous tip, and closed the door.



The elves watched us with a mixture of frustration and a touch of reverence.



Marcus turned to me. ""Eric. Let's go.""



""Wait,"" the woman said. ""I have a question for this messenger. Do you know who you work for? Do you understand the true meaning of the Ouroboros?""



""I..."" I looked at Marcus, then frantically flipped through the booklet. ""The booklet says the company was founded by Famine, and it's an Ouroboros. A snake that devours its own tail.""



Marcus didn't speak until we were in the car.



""Yes,"" Marcus said. ""That's right. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Famine, is real, Eric. It's one of the fundamental forces that make up the universe, given form. It's the hunger that drives all existence. Every sixty years, it must devour itself, must consume its own essence to restart the cycle. That's the meaning of our existence. To ensure the cosmic cycle continues.""



""You work for a god?"" I whispered.



""Not a god. Something older than gods. Something more fundamental. To them, humans are like goldfish, and the fae are the cats that steal the goldfish."" Marcus started the car.



""That's terrifying,"" was all I could say.



""That's why we have rules. That's why we follow procedures. That's why we feed the creatures that live in the cracks. Someone has to do this job, Eric. Someone has to walk the line, keeping the two sides as separate as possible. But it's not entirely possible, like... in London. The real London is beneath London, and every year a few humans accidentally take the King's Cross train to the real London, instead of Soho.""



We drove back to the warehouse in silence. I sat in the passenger seat, the frantic energy finally fading, leaving only exhaustion and shame.



""I'm sorry,"" I finally said. ""I should have finished reading that record. I should have called earlier. I was so hyped up, I thought—""



""You thought you could handle it alone. I know."" “Marcus glanced at me. “Eric, I’m going to tell you something I wouldn’t tell most couriers. This job finds people like you because you already have one foot in the borderlands of two worlds, you can perceive things that others can’t. That makes you valuable. But it also makes you vulnerable.”



“So I’m a broken person?”



“You’re just different. There’s a difference.” He drove the car into the warehouse parking lot. “You’re one of the best couriers I’ve ever managed, you just need to know when to ask for help. Because I still need you.”



“I chose the wrong door,” I said softly, and Marcus didn’t reply.



“Can I ask a question? About the Famine?”



“Ask away.”



“If something like God is so powerful, so fundamental… can it be killed?”



“No,” Marcus said simply. “It can’t. God doesn’t live in the way you understand life; God simply exists. It has always existed and will always exist. All we can do is maintain our relationship with it.”



“Have you seen it? The Famine?”



Marcus gave that most standard of smiles. “Oh, yes. Many times. I’ll eventually encounter it again. Every manager does, at least once. It’s part of the final evaluation.”



“Final evaluation of what?”



“Whether you get promoted to management. Or switch to something else.” He got out of the car, telling me to return the car to him tomorrow. “But that’s for later.



“Go home. Get a good night’s sleep. Take a day off tomorrow. No deliveries. Doctor’s orders.”



“You’re not a doctor.”



“I’m seven hundred years old. Close enough.” He paused. “Eric? Have a good holiday.”



I didn’t know that ,six months later, I would meet the Famine myself.

“Ok Jacob. This isn't going to be like last time, is it?” Asks the clinician. 

Jacob tilts his head slightly and asks “How do you mean?”

:cut: :flashback:
In a chaotic scene, two security guards carry a struggling Jacob down the hallway, and out of the front door of a hospital. 

“Why?!? Why?!?” Jacob cries out as he is held from reentering the facility. 

An irate black man storms outside and yells. “You told our intake nurse your last drink was two weeks ago! That's why!”

“I have a drinking problem! I do!” Jacob yells back

“Get the fuck out of here before we call the cops!”
:cut: :end flashback:

“Really?” Asks the woman. 

Jacob leans forward, changing his body language from casual to serious. “You know why I am here, and how I got here.”

The woman turns more sympathetic. “Yes, you came directly from the hospital.”

“Because I overdosed on heroin.”

“Yes. I am glad you are still with us.”

Jacob takes a big inhale and exhales and says “Thank you, as am I.”

The clinician gives him a second and then says “So I have more questions I need to ask you.”

Jacob puts his head in his hands “I am ashamed of all of this, can't we do this later?”

“It's either this, or group.”

Jacob stands up quickly. “I'll go to group.”

The clinician exhales and says “Very well, it's down the hall, it just started.”

Jacob bows, and leaves the room and heads down the hall. 

Jacob walks in the room and finds a seat. 
Jacob sits in a circle of 12 other people, most of whom are wearing the same maroon hospital scrubs that he is wearing. They sit in a not fully cleaned, small room with a TV on the wall, about 5 circular tables pushed to the side, and a coffee machine on the table.

”My name is Jacob, and I’m an addict.”

“Hi Jacob” responds the group, in unison. 

The group facilitator then says “OK, now that we've all introduced ourselves, let's go around the circle and give a little insight into what got you each here today. Jacob, why don't you start us off?”

Jacob blankly stares at a spot on the floor directly in front of him, eyes wide. 
“Jacob?” the facilitator says again. 

Jacob takes a deep breath, looks at the facilitator, and begins. “Why am I here? Like, here in this detox? Here as in, ‘here’ at this point in my life compared to where I should be? Here as in…”

“Here, in detox, as an addict.” The facilitator clarifies. 

Jacob smirks, and restarts. “I am here because I can't stop doing heroin… ever.”

Jacob stops talking. Everyone looks at him either puzzled, amused, or both. 
“And you want to stop doing heroin, right?”

“Yes, that.” Jacob nods approvingly as he says it. 

Everyone sits in silence. 
“That's all you want to share Jacob?”

Used to weigh 90-105kg at my highest from my teens to 25 yo and have since lost 20kg and weight 80-83kg now. 

Have been insecure and full of anxiety since I was a child. 

My BP at my heaviest used to be 145/90 after I lost the weight it went down to 120/80 110/70  but now even after I've lost all the weight and lifestyle changes my BP has spiked to an average of  140-90. 

I went to the doctor in August after I had finally had it with my headaches (since childhood) and got a full check up and ekg (everything normal and within stable parameters) and doctor said BP and headaches were most likely due to anxiety and would rather not prescribe any medication. 

My BP is 140/90 on my first take and goes down to 124/83 2-3 minutes after. 

As soon as I get back to my daily routine I can literally feel it rising back up. It freaking sucks.

As we know, CSM is more of a value brand and typically accessible at Grocery Stores and most wine shops. Canoe Ridge is one of their nicer locations and I purchased for about $40/bottle for 15-17yr old bottles through a sale the vineyard was running in October.  All 3 wines were

completely different.

2008 - completely forgettable

Dark fruit, black cherry with a floral note on the nose, cherry and slight coffee on the palate,

tannins seemed non existent and the finish was short… i mean embarrassedly short to being zero.  I would not recommend this vintage.

2009 - probably one of the best wines I’ve had in the past 4 to 5 years.  Ridiculously good.

Fragrant black and blue fruit with toasty oak, clove/anise, just perfumed so beautifully.  Dark cherry with sweet fruits, tobacco, sandalwood with a hint of vanilla, this wine was round and creamy with well integrated tannins and a long finish… I kept smacking my lips and tongue.  Man did it go down quick… too quick.  if I could drink this wine every day for the rest of my life, I would be very happy.

2010 - A very good wine

Dark fruit like currant and cassis, cinnamon and an earthy ash note.  Great tannins, nicely integrated , with flavors of cherry, espresso , cedar, and milk chocolate.  I was a little confused drinking this wine as the flavors straddled old and new world but in the end, a very good wine.

Each wine was about 14.5% abv and 95% cab with a touch of Merlot, Malbec or Syrah or all three, leading to a unique flavor profile for each.

I pan seared and basted a filet with garlic butter and herbs, a blueberry and red wine compote and side of broccolini… all three went well but the 2009 was outstanding, the rich round fruity wine played well with the blueberry sauce, the chocolatey coffee notes on the 2010 was splendid with the steak.",15,1765852766.0,wine,2,1.0,False

5. At 2 minutes, turn on the switch.

1pnqhwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1pnqhwe/feeling_hurt_and_lost/,Feeling hurt and lost,"About a month ago, Bramble (a member of the local kink community) expressed interest in having a scene with one or both of my partners. I was open to that. When Sunflower (one of my partners), started expressing romantic and sexual interest in Bramble, I was a little surprised but encouraged her to explore since I had been wanting her to start feeling comfortable looking for new partners. Sunflower and I had been going through a very rough patch for a while due to issues caused by a bad therapist who didn't understand polyamory. We're still working on mending things, and things have been getting much better for us. 

Dahlia (my other partner) had been becoming more distant due to feeling dragged into Sunflower and I's relationship issues. I had tried to not bring my issues with Sunflower up around her, but because she and Sunflower are best friends, she has ended up listening to Sunflower venting on occasion. I had brought up several times how I didn't like how disconnected Dahlia and I had been lately, and how upsetting I found her being glued to her phone during our date and cuddle time was. She had agreed and suggested that we try to reconnect on our next date night. She has also asked if I'd be okay since I had to go into the office the next day after our date night if Bramble came over for her and him to discuss a possible scene they wanted to try at the next play party. 

The weekend before this date night, Sunflower and Bramble had oral sex together. Sunflower had given me a heads up that he was spending the night and that it was a possibility. Date night with Dahlia came around, and the first part of our date she spent cleaning her apartment for Bramble's visit. After she got to a point she was okay stopping at, we made dinner, had a small scene, had sex, and then she passed out. When we got up the next morning, I tried to cuddle her for a bit, but after 10 minutes or so, she jumped out of bed and went back to cleaning. I got up and made coffee for us and tried to enjoy the time I had with her before I would have to leave for the office. After about another 30 minutes, Bramble messaged her saying he had got off work early and was almost there. I didn't want to be there when they were discussing their scene, so I left. It felt very sudden and very much unnerved me since the way Dahlia had communicated things, it was implied that he would be coming over after I left for work, not an hour and a half before. Dahlia later claimed that she told me he was coming at 8, but I never remember her saying that, nor did she bring it up the several times we talked about when I'd have to leave for the office.

Later that evening, I messaged in our private discord that I really didn't like how I felt after being rushed out and that in the future, she shouldn't plan dates immediately after each other. She agreed and didn't talk more. The next day she didn't really talk in our messages or discord. She's not the type to be silent, so I started spiraling. On day 3, I reached out and used some emojis from the emoji code we developed for communicating feelings when we find it hard to talk. Eventually I was able to get her to start talking and she was upset at me because I felt rushed out and discarded. She also felt that I shouldn't have been as bothered by her cleaning on our date since I know she has anxiety about folks seeing her apartment for the first time. After a bit of back and forth, she eventually dropped that she and Bramble had had sex. That hurt a lot and I compared her to her ex who used to spring new sexual partners on her like that frequently. Her phone died shortly after, and I spiraled very hard for the next two days because again, her going silent isn't like her. I eventually asked to meet in person and try to talk. By this point, it was feeling very much like I'd been kicked out and replaced. She agreed, and I came over when she asked me to. I had thought things should be okay since I knew Bramble had spent the night with Sunflower because they were planning to have sex. Sunflower had given me the heads up that they were planning that the weekend before after they had had oral. I did not expect to see Bramble leaving Dahlia's apartment. Apparently he came by to give her a treat he'd bought for her.

When I went inside, things were tense between Dahlia and I. I sat on the couch and asked if we were okay. She said yes. I then asked if I could hug her and she said yes. I broke down and started bawling because I had been so worried that she had decided to end things with me. We talked a bit and agreed to have a more in depth talk later on our normal date night. When our date night came, I proposed trying to use something I'd heard about on a podcast for repairing relationships called Repair SHOP. Basically, each person takes time to explain the rupture from their point of view and includes their history that influenced their feelings and how they viewed the rupture. After both sides have shared their story and history, both sides take ownership for what they could have done better in the rupture. Lastly, both sides try to figure out how to prevent a similar rupture from happening again in the future. 

I explained how she had never told me he was coming over that early. If she had, I wouldn't have spent the night. Because of that, I felt like my time with her was unexpectedly cut short and that I was literally kicked out. Dahlia sleeping with Bramble without giving any indication that she was interested in that possibility was also a big blow. Especially since she claims to be demisexual. I later learned that Sunflower was also incredibly upset that Dahlia slept with Bramble as soon as she had started being intimate with him. Dahlia going quiet and not communicating afterwards also really hurt, especially because she has made such a big deal out of how hurt she gets if a partner goes silent on her. I tried to explain how all of this left me feeling broken and incredibly hurt. 

She explained that she was hurt that she felt like she'd tried to reconnect by conversing with me while she cleaned. She said that she'd reminded me that Bramble was coming over and insists she told me once that it would be at 8. I don't remember that and would have questioned why he was coming over that early. She was also upset that I felt discarded. She was also very hurt that I compared her to her ex. We agreed to not schedule back to back dates anymore and to try and be better at giving each other heads up if we have sexual interest in anyone. I also agreed to not compare her to her ex and to treat that as a hard limit for her.

I tried to go to a couple of events that Bramble was at after all of this, but I've found that he reminds me of just how hurt I was by all of this. I've made a boundary for myself that I won't go to any events with him because I do not like the feelings he brings up in me. This has meant that I've essentially had to leave the local kink community. I'm working with my therapist to try and understand all of the feelings that are coming up due to Bramble. I've never had this reaction to any of my metas before, but I've never had a partner start a relationship with my meta by making me feel kicked out and discarded either. 

My partners are upset that I've left the kink community due to not wanting to go to the same events as Bramble. They've been trying to pressure me into going and just ignoring him. I tried that, and it didn't work for me, which is why I chose to stop going to events. They are upset at me and saying that I'm making them choose between Bramble and I, especially for one off events. I feel bad for Sunflower as she had been very good about trying to give me heads up with how things were moving with her and Bramble so that I wouldn't be caught by surprise like Dahlia did to me. But being around Bramble, even if we're not directly interacting, brings up feelings of pain and hurt and betrayal. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to give in and ignore a boundary I've set for myself just to make my partners' lives easier. I've made a lot of progress on being less codependent, and that feels like that would just be diving headfirst back into codependency. I don't know if Dahlia fully understands just how hurt I was by her and Bramble. Dahlia and I had been talking about becoming nesting primary partners, but I think we have bigger issues to work through before we can go back to those talks.
