This happened to me.

I was 27, sitting in a glass-walled conference room, nodding through another Monday morning meeting where I barely spoke. My ideas were good—I knew that—but I always held back.
Not because I lacked confidence. But because I knew, deep down, I was different. The only gay guy on the team. No one was hostile. No one was kind, either. Just polite distance. Micro-judgments. A subtle glass ceiling.

Then one day, I saw a resume come across our desk. Same role I had once applied for.
His LinkedIn photo had a little Pride frame. His email signature had pronouns. And I remembered what it was like—sending out application after application, hoping for just one person to see you for who you are and what you bring.

So I did something small. I nudged the hiring manager. “Hey, this guy looks interesting—let’s talk to him.”
He got the interview.
Then he got the job.
Now, a year later, we grab coffee and talk strategy. He thrives. He’s out. He’s confident. He’s leading Pride ERG events. He’s what I wished I had back then.

And I realized… this isn’t just about hiring.
It’s about healing.

So here’s my message to every gay professional scrolling through Reddit right now, disheartened by rejection emails and ghosted applications:

You are not alone in this job market.

We are everywhere—in the HR departments, in the hiring panels, in the teams you want to join.
And we remember what it felt like to be overlooked, underpaid, and unseen.

That’s why this community exists.
To give you the backdoor, the boost, and the brotherhood that the corporate world never offered us.

Drop your LinkedIn. Or a generic message not revealing your details if some texts someone texts Post your role. Offer a referral. Ask for help.
Let’s build a gay pipeline so strong that no one has to walk alone ever again.

We’re not just working our way up anymore.
We’re pulling others up with us.

1jtb9w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/realityshifting/comments/1jtb9w0/something_weird_happened_on_the_3_train/,Something weird happened on the 3 train,"Not sure if this really counts as “shifting,” but it was… unsettling. I wasn’t even going to post until this morning but I’m curious about your thoughts, so here goes.

I’ve been trying to get a promotion, putting in some extra effort with one of our clients. The meeting ran way too long, the kind where you’re nodding politely through your sixth round of revisions on a PowerPoint slide for the appendix that no one will ever read. I was fried, suit still on, tie half-loosened, and walking to the subway stop on 42^(nd) Street.

I remember hating that it was already humid in April. Sticky shirt, damp collar, basically perfect subway weather.

The train was maybe a third full. Everyone had that glazed, dead-eyed late-night look. There was a guy with a construction vest sleeping upright. Two teens with headphones sharing a phone screen. A woman doing the crossword in pen. Normal.

A candy woman walked by. You know the type “Got candy, got snacks, two for a dollar, cash or CashApp.” She had a small plastic tote, crinkling as she moved down the aisle. Nobody bought anything, but she made it to the next car and kept going. Her voice faded. Just the sound of wheels on track, the low hum of the semi-working AC.

The lights overhead blinked once, just a surge, and suddenly everything went black and white. Not dark. Just… colorless. The teens. The crossword woman. The ad posters. Even the orange seats were just gray. The whole world, drained of color.

Except me. I looked down at my hands, my pants, my socks. Still in color, slightly shaking.

No one else reacted. That’s what really got me. They just sat there, perfectly still, eyes glassy. No confusion. No movement. Just... grayscale passengers in a world that had stopped caring about color.

It took a few seconds before I realized that it wasn’t visual. The train kept moving, but everything inside it stopped. The hum? Gone. The clatter of the tracks? Gone. I clapped my hands once. Nothing. Tried to speak, no voice. I couldn’t even hear my own heartbeat.

It was like someone hit mute on the universe.

That’s when I noticed the sconce. Yes, a literal wall sconce, like something out of an old mansion, attached near the connecting door. It hadn’t been there before. Wrought iron, twisted into an impossible knot, the flickering flame was the only color in the car, the orange flame bent sideways, but it didn’t cast any light. The glow stayed trapped in the glass.

Right next to it was a brass handle, not a rail, but a handle, like you’d use to pull open a hidden panel. It gleamed faintly, even in the absence of light.

I stood up. Don’t ask me why. I just felt like I had to see more. And I did.

I looked out the window. Not the tunnel walls I expected. Not graffiti or pipes or dust.

Outside, the tunnels stretched upward and sideways, hundreds of them intersecting like water pipes. Inside some, I saw people frozen in grayscale.

Below us, buildings that reminded me of the Gothic cathedrals in Europe. More sconces lined the outside too, hundreds of them, spaced unevenly, some upside down, some floating inches off the wall. They all burned that same pale flame that didn't touch the walls.

I was captivated, staring at the scenery with utter fascination.

That’s when the fear hit me. Sweat dripped into my eyes, and I moved to wipe it away. And as soon as I blinked…

Color.

Sound.

Movement.

I felt a jolt of normalcy like cold water to the face. The train jerked slightly. The lights buzzed. The crossword lady flipped a page.

It was like nothing happened.

I got off two stops later. Walked home in a daze. Told myself it was exhaustion. Maybe something in the air. Dehydration. Or just too much work.

The next morning, Wednesday, I booted up. Coffee in hand, half-asleep, just trying to get through the day.

Before anything loaded, the CMD prompt popped up.  
Not one I opened, not one I could close. It typed two lines:

*C:\\Users\\¤̸̳̓§⟁∆...*  

*Z:\\Users\\> Welcome Back, Commander*

It blinked twice and vanished.  
Surely it wasn’t meant for me. I’ve never been in the military.

Now I’m just… here. Writing this. Wondering if I should ignore it or if someone else has seen something like this. The sconces. The silence. The frozen people.  
Or maybe I really do need to lay off the late-night PowerPoint.

Only took me 1.5 days to do it... Like I said, never done one and I work on commercial coffee equipment for my job. I'm just stubborn and tenacious. Thanks Dad for teaching me anything can be fixed, just depends on how much you want to save.

The tricky part for me was getting the A/C compressor turned 90° vertical (belt whewlnpointong down) and over by the oil filter. I should have done that after took it off before loosening the alternator. (Face palm) Once that was done the alternator came right out and went right back together like butter.

It was fun figuring out the best way to get to connectors and bolts. Gotta love all the wire clips, metal clamps and random sharp edges... just like commercial coffee equipment. 🙃

Getting access via the front passenger wheel well was a first as well. Lifting the engine 1.5"" to remove a bolt on the alternator was a nice solution - thanks design engineers. 🫤 (Again see comment about similarities to coffee equipment 😐

1jtb3ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/SafeScare/comments/1jtb3ee/the_office_phone_rang_after_closing_no_one_should/,The Office Phone Rang After Closing. No One Should Have Had That Number.,"It was just after 11 PM when the store officially closed. Customers had been cleared out, lights were dimmed across most of the aisles, and the floor crew had clocked out for the night. Only two of us were left inside. Me and one of the newer employees, Daniel. We were upstairs in the office, finishing up the weekly financials. Payroll reports, safe counts, the usual end-of-week paperwork that always took longer than it should.

Our office was tucked above the floor on the second level of the supermarket. It wasn’t fancy. Just a windowed room with metal cabinets, two desks, an old rolling chair, and one security monitor hooked into the main camera system. From up there, you could see about half the store floor. Aisles 1 through 7, plus the front registers, customer service, and part of the bakery. The rest of the store stretched into blind corners, blocked by beams and signage. The stairs to our office were inside a locked staff hallway that ran along the back wall, behind the dairy section.

It was quiet, the kind of stillness that only really settles in when a building meant to be loud finally goes silent. The air felt heavier than usual. Even the hum of the freezers downstairs seemed duller, like the whole building was holding its breath. We had music playing low from one of our phones, just to fill the space.

Daniel was at the desk across from me, sipping his second gas station coffee. I was double-checking register summaries for the day, just trying to get through the last stretch. We were both tired, but too close to being done to call it a night.

Then the manager phone rang.

Not one of the aisle phones. Not a line from the service desk. It was the direct line to the upstairs office. The internal extension. The only people who ever called it were corporate, loss prevention, or sometimes other store managers during shift changes.

We both froze. Daniel looked over at me, then slowly reached for the phone.

He picked it up and said, ""Hello? This is Daniel.""

No answer. He waited a few seconds. Still nothing.

He hung up and looked at me with a tight shrug. We both kind of brushed it off, figuring maybe someone misdialed.

About three minutes later, it rang again.

Same line. Same extension. Daniel picked it up again.

""Hello?""

Still nothing. But this time, I could hear something faint. I was sitting close enough to the receiver to catch it.

It sounded like breathing. Really quiet, almost like the person was trying not to be heard. Daniel said hello again, voice a little louder, then hung up.

We both sat there, completely still.

The third call came in not long after. Same thing. Office line. Daniel answered again, but this time we both leaned in.

At first, it was silent. Then came the sound. Not breathing now, but something else.

It was muffled. Almost distant. Like someone screaming far away with their mouth covered. The kind of sound that you recognize as a person, but not enough to understand what they’re saying.

Daniel slammed the phone down.

We immediately went to the security feed and started switching through the cameras. Nothing was moving. No one was in the aisles. The doors were locked. No cars outside. The monitors showed a perfectly still supermarket, half-lit and quiet.

""That line isn’t public,"" Daniel said quietly.

It was true. The internal manager line couldn’t be accessed without knowing the direct extension and how to route through the store system. There’s no way some prank caller could guess it. And besides, the store was closed. The only two people inside were both sitting in the same office.

We tried to shake it off. Told ourselves maybe it was a glitch. Or maybe someone from another store accidentally dialed in. Even though we both knew it didn’t sound like that.

That’s when my personal phone started ringing.

I looked down. It was a number I didn’t recognize. Area code from two states over.

""You getting a call right now?"" I asked.

Daniel looked down. His screen lit up with a different unknown number. Completely different area code.

We didn’t answer.

We let both calls go to voicemail, but no message was left.

Ten minutes passed. Nothing happened. We went back to finishing our reports, trying to laugh it off. Told ourselves it was probably a phone scam or spam system that hit us at the same time. Weird timing, but not impossible.

Then I got a text.

No message. Just a photo.

It was taken from the store floor, angled up through the window that looked into our office.

The picture showed me and Daniel, sitting at our desks. Working.

""Daniel,"" I said. I turned my phone around.

His face went pale.

""That had to be old,"" he said. But the timestamp on the message said it had been sent thirty seconds ago.

We ran to the window and looked down.

There was no one.

No footsteps. No shadows. No phone light. Nothing. Just shelves, pallet stacks, and the faint reflection of our own office window. The air outside the glass looked heavy, almost blurry. Like the air itself didn’t want to be still anymore.

Then the office phone rang again.

We didn’t answer.

We jumped out of our chairs, grabbing everything without even thinking. I stuffed the paperwork into my backpack, Daniel yanked the USB drive from the register report printer, and we didn’t even turn the lights off. We flung open the office door and took the stairs two at a time.

The hallway on the lower level felt way longer than it normally did. Our footsteps were the only sound, sharp and fast against the tile. We turned the corner, passed the dark dairy cooler, and reached the alarm box. I punched in the override code with fingers that felt stiff and clumsy.

The beeping stopped. We pushed the front door open hard enough to rattle it.

The outside felt too wide. The cold night air hit like a wave. The parking lot was still. The floodlights flickered slightly, casting long shadows from the shopping cart corral. Everything looked the same, but it didn’t feel the same. The place had shifted. Not visibly, but underneath.

We didn’t talk. We didn’t look back. We got into Daniel’s car like we were being chased, and the second the doors were shut, he started the engine and tore out of there without hesitation.

We didn’t even speak until we were halfway down the road. The silence in the car was thick, broken only by the hum of the tires on the road and the occasional tap of the blinker.

My phone buzzed again.

Same area code. Different number.

Welp it was a good run but.... im tired so very tired.

I was fortunate to gain manager experience through being a shift, meet cool people, make good memories, meet my fiancee and become black apron certified but the bad outward the good EVERYTIME!!!

I am done being abused by management  and being told that customers have every right to treat us like 💩💩💩.

I was forced to work sick and that was my last straw... it should have been my last straw when.

1) my fiancee didn't get paid mileage when we moved towns and he had to drive a total of 2 hours to help our old store who held him there 2 months after his transfer was set because  they needed a shift advisor.

2) when I was written up for trying to report my manager to my district manager for the mistreatment I was getting from them.

3) when I had a cigarette thrown at me by a customer and I was told that I was overreacting 

4) When my fiancee was told to keep his store open even though his stores ice machine caught on fire

5) when I tried to promote to uppermanagment 3 times and was told I was missing something (THAT WE DONT LEARN UNLESS WE ARE MANAGERS) each time and they hire externally 

6) When my store had 4 different managers leave our store at the same time of me trying to promote.

7) having to do my managers job.

8) BULLYING

And so so much more...... (decreasing my pay as a shift because I transferred stores)

This company  lost everything it stood for and it's sad to see.... they expect the impossible from people... time to go to a coffee shop that values me as a partner and get paid for my work properly.

Bella (21 F) is the glue to our whole group. The two of us met on our dorm floor freshman year and overtime, Bella made a few friends who I befriended through her. We've always been pretty different with me being a homebody while she always went out on weekends. Since she has a summer birthday, she hasn't been able to go to clubs until this school year. Her and the group have gone out a lot while I always stayed in, even before they started clubbing. I would just hang out with them during the day or host potlucks from time to time. 

With this being my last semester before student teaching, I've been super busy so we haven't even been able to hang out as much. Because of this, we planned one night where they would come over to my place, get baked, do some baking, and watch horrible movies, and then another night I go out to a club with them. That way we all can do stuff together that we all can enjoy. 

We had planned to go out a few weeks ago, but I had to bail the day before because my family's dog was hit by a car and I wanted to be with him in case those were his final moments (he is okay and recovering now). So we rescheduled for the other night. 

Earlier in the morning though, I was in the ceramics studio working on my final when I cut my hand with a rusty tool. I don't know how but it was a really bad cut and I needed a few stitches plus a tetanus shot. It was only two stitches but I still made the decision to cancel again. I was worried about my hand getting hurt because I know the clubs around here are always so packed and I didn't need people accidentally bumping into it while it was still sore. If the stitches weren't so new, I would have gone, I swear. 

I apologized to Bella and offered for us to go next week, and I hoped that she would understand but instead she left me on read for an hour before sending me a lengthy text about how upset she is that I had bailed again. She expressed her frustration that I never went out with her and the group, and that the most we ever did nowadays was study and get coffee. Despite these two times being the only times I ever bailed, it hurt because this was supposed to be our big hangout. Her and the rest of the group all thought that my injury shouldn't have been a problem, and that they could've accommodated me. They think I am being a jerk because I've bailed two times now. I feel bad, I really do. But none of these were in my control. It's not like I bailed because I just didn't want to go.",0,1743993198.0,AmItheAsshole,5,0.5,False

**Solution Composition**

The cleaning solutions included in these kits are specially formulated to remove fingerprints, smudges, and oils without damaging the oleophobic coating on iPhone screens.Most solutions are alcohol-free and ammonia-free, preventing potential damage to the screen's delicate surface.

1jtapzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/comments/1jtapzn/not_too_sweet_recipe_recommendations/,Not too sweet recipe recommendations,"I just ordered my Creami and can’t wait for it to show up!

I’m looking for recipes that are not super sweet. I love ice cream, froyo, and gelato but store bought ones tend to be really sweet, especially if they have mix ins like caramel or toffee. To get a sense of my tastes — when I eat Oreos, I eat the cookie and throw away the cream. I’m not looking to replace sugar calories with low calorie sweeteners — I actually just want a frozen dessert that doesn’t taste as sweet and is still creamy and delicious. The problem with churning desserts like this in a traditional churn is it gets very icy without the sugar. 

The kinds of commercial or artisanal ice cream flavors I like are very dark bitter chocolate, nut flavors like almonds/hazelnut/pistachio, coffee, mascarpone, or tart frozen yogurt. Mostly I like the aromatics but I think I like these flavors because they aren’t overpoweringly sweet. I find most protein shakes and protein powders too sweet as well — my favorite meal replacement shake is original Soylent, which tastes kind of like a very lightly sweetened soymilk. I also eat a lot of plain whole milk (or even 10% fat) Greek yogurt with fruit and no added sweetener, and I used to just blend those together with half a banana and ice before my nutribullet died, and that’s why I bought the Creami.

Can anyone recommend some starter recipes for my full fat, not super sweet tastes?

1jtamlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedSpa/comments/1jtamlj/marketing_lessons_learned_from_helping_my_wife/,Marketing Lessons Learned from helping my wife grow her injector business and building a medspa directory,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share some insights I’ve gained from two key experiences: helping my wife (Spanish speaking) grow her business as an injector and building [**Cuidocs.com**](http://Cuidocs.com), a directory connecting Spanish-speaking patients with medspas and injectors.

These experiences have taught me a lot about the challenges local aesthetic businesses face in marketing—and how collaboration and strategy can help overcome them.

# Economies of scale in marketing matter a lot

One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is how **economies of scale** impact marketing success. Large companies can afford to invest heavily in branding, advertising, and content creation because they operate across multiple markets, spreading costs across a wider audience. For example:

* Big chains can produce professional video content, run nationwide ad campaigns, and hire specialized teams for SEO, social media, and email marketing—all while staying profitable.
* Local medspas, however, often don’t have the resources to compete at this level. Without the ability to scale across multiple markets, it’s hard to justify the same level of investment.

This challenge is one of the reasons I started Cuidocs. I believe that by creating a network of reliable medspas and injectors, we can replicate the benefits of scale for smaller businesses. By working together under one platform, we can pool resources, share knowledge, and collectively reach more patients—especially underserved groups like the Hispanic community.

# Breaking Down Marketing: Acquisition, Retention, and Referrals

From my experience building Cuidocs and helping my wife with her practice, I’ve found that focusing on three key areas—**acquisition**, **retention**, and **referrals**—is essential for growth:

# 1. Acquisition

* **Google My Business (GMB)**: A well-optimized GMB profile is one of the most cost-effective ways to attract local patients. Include professional photos, bilingual descriptions, and encourage reviews from happy clients.
* **Omnichannel Content Strategy**: Start with YouTube-first organic content (great for education) and repurpose it into blog posts, Instagram reels, TikTok videos, and more. This approach stretches your content further without requiring constant new material.
* **Local Partnerships**: Collaborate with complementary businesses like gyms or salons for cross-promotions or co-hosted events. Be cautious about paying for leads—it’s prohibited in some states due to anti-kickback laws. Instead of paying directly for referrals or leads, focus on mutually beneficial partnerships that involve shared promotions or events rather than monetary exchanges tied to patient referrals.
* **Directories**: Listing your business in specialized directories like Cuidocs can help you tap into new audiences without having to invest heavily in ads.

# 2. Retention

* Use personalized communication channels like email, SMS, or WhatsApp to stay connected with your patients. Share exclusive specials or reminders about follow-up treatments to keep them engaged.
* Always ask for feedback after treatments—it not only improves patient satisfaction but also gives you insights into how you can improve your services.

# 3. Referrals

* Word-of-mouth remains one of the most powerful growth channels in aesthetics. Incentivize referrals by offering rewards (like discounts or free add-ons) for both the referrer and the new client—but ensure compliance with state laws around referral programs. Avoid any structure that resembles paying directly for leads or referrals as this could violate anti-kickback laws in healthcare settings. Instead, focus on creating referral programs that reward loyalty without crossing legal boundaries.
* Make the referral process easy by providing patients with referral codes or links they can share via email or social media.

# Agencies vs Freelancers vs In-house teams

One of the decisions any medspa or injector needs to make is how to handle marketing. Here are my thoughts based on experience:

* **In-House Team**: If you can afford it, having an internal team is the best way for building unique market intelligence tailored to your business. However, this requires significant revenue to support multiple specialists across channels. You can't have one single person to do everything, you need specialists to win. The benefit is complete control over your strategy and a deeper understanding of your ICP.
* **Agencies**: Specialized agencies that focus on aesthetics can be a good option, especially if they limit their client base within your geographic area (so you don't have much competition). They bring diverse expertise and can execute campaigns efficiently, but you may lose some flexibility and personalization.
* **Freelancers**: Freelancers can deliver excellent results at lower costs compared to agencies, but finding the right one takes time. Keep in mind that they may not have the same level of commitment as an employee or agency partner.

If you’re considering doing it yourself, I highly recommend reading *Who Not How* by Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy. The book emphasizes the importance of finding the right “Whos” to help you achieve your goals rather than trying to do everything yourself—a mindset shift that’s been transformative for me.

If you are interested, I can share a set of interview questions, just DM me. There are so many shady agencies trying to get Medspas and doctors money that deliver poor results. Key questions here is referrals from other clients, their retention and experience in each of the different three key areas (acquisition, retention, referrals).

# Lessons from building Cuidocs

When creating Cuidocs, I realized how underserved the Hispanic market is in aesthetics. Many patients are looking for providers who understand their cultural preferences and speak their language but don’t know where to start. By focusing on education and connecting patients with trusted providers, we’re trying to bridge this gap while helping practices grow organically.

At the same time, Cuidocs aims to give smaller medspas access to scale-like benefits by working together as a network. By pooling resources and sharing visibility under one platform, we can help local businesses compete with larger chains while maintaining their independence.

# Final Thoughts

If you’re a local medspa owner or injector wondering how to balance acquisition, retention, and referrals effectively while staying profitable and compliant, collaboration might be your best path forward.

1jtah8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatoon/comments/1jtah8g/thank_you_saskatoonians/,Thank you Saskatoonians!,"I had posted a couple of weeks ago asking for restaurant recommendations for a first-timer, and y’all came through. 

First let me say you have an amazing city. I’ve had a fantastic time here and would like to come back, perhaps once melt/mud season is over. I want to do the longer hike at Wanuskewin (it was too windy the day I went, and bitterly cold), I want to see a lacrosse game (was too tired), I want to go running along the river, and I want to really explore the Remai Modern. 

First, restaurants. I didn’t have as much time as I thought and some of the things were closed before I could get there. I missed Bannock Express, for example.  

Baba’s Perogies was fantastic and I stuffed myself on pierogi and cabbage rolls and a smokie. With S’toon berry pie for dessert. 

The restaurant at Wanuskewin was fantastic. I went for a short hike. It was -6° and terribly windy and I was chilled to the bone, and a bowl of bison stew with bannock, and the pumpkin cornmeal dessert with a cup of coffee, was just what I needed. 

I had shorter lunch breaks than I wanted, so one day I went to a place with absolutely zero parking called something like Fuh Palace. (Their spelling, not mine.) I live near Little Saigon, so Vietnamese food is my comfort food. The vermicelli (bún tôm thịt nướng cha giò) was quite good, though I wish the pork had been grilled a bit crispier, that there was herbs other than iceberg lettuce, and that they had given me any hot sauce in my to-go bag. Still. Tasty. 

I ended up at the Yard and Flagon one night after failing to go to Bannock Express. Very tasty elk burger with poutine and a couple pints of local pils. 

Those of you who recommended Hearth, I salute you. That mushroom plate was ridonkulous. It was so good I barely ate my main. 

For coffee I ended up at Sparrow one day (delicious and their oatmeal with poached pear was almost exactly how my Mexican household makes it, muy aguadito —almost like a soup) and at Five Corners one day. The muffin at Five Corners was still warm and delicious. The coffee was good but not remarkable. 

Unfortunately I did not get to Saskmade. I did buy some stuff at Wanuskewin, including haskap jam, and of course general Canadian specialities such as Hawkins Cheezies, Coffee Crisp, like five packs of Decadent chocolate chip cookies, maple syrup, and Smarties. I’ll have to make time when I return. 

Thanks again for treating a Yankee Doodle so kindly. Once my ridiculous government gets its head out of its bum, if I can return the favour in SoCal or Central California, please let me know. 

I have to say, Saskatoon and Saskatoonians treated me far better than I could ever have had any right to expect. There were a couple of moments of “wait, you’re from WHERE? why are you here?” but genuine friendliness. ",67,1743991593.0,saskatoon,4,0.97,False

He was extremely charming on his dating profile mentioned that he was looking for his wife, and that dating apps kind of took the fun out of courting. 

We seem to hit it off and two weeks and he abruptly ended things with me something about he didn’t feel that he could give me what I needed ..

Which struck me as a surprise because the previous day we had a conversation about  if we were hanging out too much or too little. I expressed that if we need to slow down that was okay that I loved a good slow burn and that communication through things was important to me. And so little words, he told me that he wasn’t very good about communicating when it came to stuff like this and reassured me that everything was fine and everything was going well.

Obviously took me by surprise 

Two weeks later, I received an apology from him. Maybe he didn’t want to be the bad guy in the story for ending things how they did. I went on to let him know that his actions didn’t match up with his words.

He texted me two weeks after that and confessed that he was missing me and that he ended things because he got scared that he liked me too much and was wondering if we could get together to have coffee or lunch 

The brings us to mid March. I agreed to meet up with him for an early lunch and we talked about what it happened. He basically told me that right now in his life, he wasn’t feeling like he could be something to somebody because of whatever situation he was going through but that he wanted to try again if I was open to it, I agreed under the stipulation that he would communicate

Three weeks of now gone by and I gradually saw him starting to kind of pull back. I haven’t necessarily been putting all my eggs in the basket as far as energy goes because I wanted to see how he was going to show up and I didn’t wanna get too excited in case he Fell into the same pattern..

Well, yesterday I got a message from him and so little words, he called me perfect, and told me that he really liked me, but that he didn’t feel like he was romantically growing with me 

I haven’t responded. It’s been over 24 hours. I guess I’m asking for advice on like what I should do and am I crazy to think that romance in your 30s doesn’t just happen overnight. We are all coming into dating with trauma and pass baggage and trying to show up and be better for one another and so it takes a little while for guards to come down.

1jtafnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1jtafnt/ca_would_this_be_deemed_work_place_harassment/,[CA] Would this be deemed work place harassment?,"So there's a situation happening at work that I feel has gone to far now.
My supervisor now director has brought her cousin, who is 100% legal but the only thing is that she only speaks Spanish. 
I'm the type that just want to get the work done(ex military)and head out so making friends isn't really my interest, but we got along because it's just me and 4 others who speak Spanish fluently.

One day I decided to be nice and offered to buy a coffee which I only had cash for 2.
Supervisor didn't take it well and somehow assumed I was trying to get with her or something. I'm 100% aware she's married with 2 kids and is alot older.
As I was going for my break one time she thought I left already, I overheard her talking to coworkers if it was right for a married woman to have friends with a guy. Multiple coworker told me about it and defended me.
I work in the far back of the house restocking and prepping food, she randomly comes and tells me ""Hey be careful she's married and with kids don't ruin a marriage""
But literally we're just friends and no interest of getting with anyone ,even my coworkers know. But I didn't say anything to my  coworker because I didn't want her to be involved or know about it. But she mentioned that the supervisor told her about her and her idea of us being friends 

Also I'm an athiest, a coworker joked around and she overhead and literally chased me around the back of the house. I hid in the fridge for 3 min. And gave me a big speech of religion. 
I respect everyone's decision and never try to convert or devalue someone's beliefs. But she's done that to two others too.

She also gives us a hard time whenever we don't want to stay passed our scheduled time. Or even tell my coworkers to clock in before our scheduled time.Which she would retaliate later and is why i take photos of my work.
Which me and a coworker reported and our boss acknowledged. She has said ""if I had the power, you people would be fired by me""

Later I found out she's trying to use her hospitality for when her cousin and her brother came her to manipulate them. Her cousin always thanked her for the help was was grateful but the supervisor didn't take it well and made it personal, and belittles her.
Same with her brother who she called, called him ungrateful after she got in trouble for leaving a burnt mac in the oven and batter mix I needed frozen.Which if she did the final walk through checklist those would have been avoided. But pointed fingers.

Now she's the director, recently she called me to the office, she didn't want me to drop chicken for her cousin or help her bring down any materials. Even though she brought up a speech about working as a team.
Thing is I only help here when I'm done with my daily task and have hours left and slow.She has mentioned well you have to do it because you're a man to other coworkers.
But it's only with me, the main supervisor and another lead was surprised I was told that and didn't know anything about that speech.
Also brought up me and her cousin again, which I said "" I'll just stop talking to her, I don't want anyone to bother her over something that doesn't exist, only if it's anything related to our job"" i keep things strictly professional.

She's been trying to be so controlling over her cousin, getting angry for her cousin leaving on time, wanting to keep her schedule, I always feel that's because she's bring in personal things outside of work into the workplace. Her cousin is always owning her station, quick worker getting things done. She has a a station kept to the far side so she's always quiet and alone.Her cousin is already considering quitting. A few coworkers are also leaving due to to her management . She's also using any minor thing to write her cousin up if she feels she's getting even the slight misunderstanding of a tone.

I'm considering just explaining all this to my boss, and maybe it's better if I left the job if it needs to happen.I know how difficult it was for  my coworker to start and learn without knowing fluent English and even working with coworkers who don't.In the job market right now that's a huge requirement and not so good. 


Ill be okay, it's just me and I'll tough it out, but she's got a family. 
I just would like thoughts on this , if its worplace harassment and if leaving would be the right thing to do in a situation like this.

I’m doing it all by the book - my kitten has a big dog kennel to sleep in and separate her from my adult cat and I’ve had her for about six weeks now, she’s probably approaching 5 or 6 months old. 
My cat is 4, and has no tolerance for the kitten who just wanted to be friends and often gets hissed at even when passing by… when she wants to play my adult cat stays relatively gentle but gives her a firm “fuck off” hiss or bats her. She growls constantly too if the kitten goes near her. Sometimes the kitten ends up chasing her, as she just wants her space, and I have to separate them. The kitten has jumped on her a few times to play and my cat was ABHORRED. 
I live in an apartment so separating usually involves putting the kitten on her harness and attaching her to the coffee table (supervised) so she chills out, but doesn’t get locked away.
Sometimes it’s looked like they’re playing - boxing with each other but my cat’s body language is so hard to read - she doesn’t use her claws, or yeowl, but her ears can be flat… but sometimes she’ll be showing her belly and it’s all very contradictory. Girl. Are you stressed or not?! I’ve never had a cat like her before, she was taken from her mum at 4 weeks old and has been an only child ever since. I feel that although she can seem unhappy sometimes, mostly she’s fine as long as the kitten leaves her alone but to the kitten she’s the most interesting thing ever. 
Generally my cat is very aloof and hates being touched. 
She never pees anywhere she shouldn’t, or scratches, nor has she exhibited any behaviours related to stress but she’s very hypervigilant and hisses if the kitten does anything. 
I don’t want to rehome the kitten but I’m getting worried they’re never going to get along, the kitten just doesn’t accept no as an answer and thinks it’s a game and as she gets to adolescence she’s testing boundaries more… and the window for rehoming her is getting smaller as she’s a black cat and most people dont want adults. And my cat is my no1 obviously, her happiness is my utmost importance.

Now I'm having to cancel that order and purchase from elsewhere due to insanely high import costs.

As you know, Mr. Trump slapped on a hefty tariff to imports from China, adding something like $600 to the import fees for the P64.

For this reason, I scrambled to find a US retailer of the P64 and came across [Prima Coffee](https://prima-coffee.com) who have a limited amount of units in stock. The downside, they're out of stock of units that are pre-installed with Omni burrs.

The Omni burrs sound like a great start for me, although I'm curious about fuller body, traditional shots at some point. Whilst mainly using my grinder for espresso and milk drinks, I will also use it for Weber Bird and someday dip my toe into home pourover; I love the pourovers from my local cafe.

With Prima Coffee, I had the choice of espresso focused burrs only to come with the P64; either SSP High Uniformity or Mizen ES. Prima carry Omni burrs for separate purchase, so I took this a sign to get both Omni and an espresso focused burr set that I think I'll probably get someday anyway.

I had to pull the trigger quickly because Prima Coffee were selling out of the P64 quickly, only having one P64 left in the color I wanted.

**My choice**: I purchased P64 with SSP High Uniformity burrs installed and an additional set of Mizen Omni burrs.

I found it ***really*** tough to choose between SSP HU and Mizen ES. In the end I thought I'd for with SSP HU for these two reasons:

1. to get the burr set that is most different to Mizen Omni, which according to [Option-o's burr choice diagram](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5b125642ec4eb782ce4f9947/ac6bfa15-db7e-4081-b303-f45ef224c29b/Burrs+Selection+Guide+-+Nov+2023.png?format=2500w) is the SSP HU
2. Option-o claim that SSP HU are excellent for getting a ""punchier"" coffee taste in milk drinks, which *really* appeals to me (see [their FAQ page](https://www.option-o.com/faq-lagom-p64))

the soup sooon
 - this is the largest and therefore has the biggest capacity, its for mouths medium to large. it does come in a ""teaspoon"" size but i chose not to obtain that one. 
 - it has a, dare i say, PERFECT scoop. not truly spherical but not deep so that a ball would rest on the edge, it rests in the deep recess and let's there be enough room for liquid of choice around it.
 - i shall be using for soups, teas i wish to sip, but not nurse, cereal, and gravy (i make gravy so good its a drink, and yes i have used it as such previously)

the bar/coffee/long spoon
 - i have no fuckin clue what this is. its awesome nonetheless. 
 - it has the long handle for whimsy & dopamine and the scoop is proportionally smaller than the large, keeping the best attributes but simply making them smaller! 
 - the smaller size makes ice cream quite easy to handle with this. 
 - i shall be using this for tea i wish to nurse, stirring of tall drinks, ice cream/cold confectionery, and tasting of gravys & sauces. 

the square edged spoon 
 - the best ""spoon"" spoon i have used. period. 
 - it does nothing spectacularly but in so doing it does EVERYTHING very well. the only thing this spoon has above the rest is the tongue & mouth feel. 
 - pertaining to the tongue and mouth feel, it is comfortable in the perpendicular entry, parallel sip, and angled attack upon the mouth. it rests so comfortably upon the tongue right side up or upside down. my preference is the angled attack.
 - the square edge is excellent for scraping and obtaining 8/10 ""food playability""

It’s not a hard drive that fills up and stops working. It’s more like a muscle—one that can grow, change, and rewire itself over time. This ability is called **neuroplasticity**, and it’s the secret weapon behind every creative breakthrough, aha moment, and sideways leap in thinking.

Creativity isn’t reserved for artists, musicians, or inventors. It’s something anyone can improve by training the brain to think differently. And the way you do that? You tap into neuroplasticity.

[creativity unleashed](https://preview.redd.it/0xz1ff3djbte1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de0189fad8a6d8fc9757d8ba27bd2d5aa816eb0f)

# What Is Neuroplasticity?

Neuroplasticity is your brain’s ability to change itself based on experience. When you learn something new or repeat a skill, your brain forms new neural connections—or strengthens old ones.

Think of it like clearing a trail in a dense forest. The more you walk that path, the easier it is to find again. Eventually, it becomes second nature.

This process happens every day, even when you’re not trying. But when you *do* try—when you challenge yourself intentionally—your brain builds new structures that can completely change how you think, create, and solve problems.

# Creativity Needs Flexibility, Not Just Talent

Creativity isn’t just about having good ideas—it’s about [generating different types of ideas](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/Images/426483-chapter-4-innovation-and-creativity.pdf), seeing patterns where others see noise, and being okay with the unknown. That kind of thinking demands mental flexibility.

Neuroplasticity is how you develop that flexibility. Every time you try something new, step out of a routine, or wrestle with a hard problem, your brain adapts. It literally changes shape—not in a sci-fi way, but in a “builds new circuits” kind of way.

>

As adults, we still have that power—we just stop using it as often.

# How the Brain Builds Creative Circuits

Here’s what’s going on when you stretch your creative muscles:

* **Synaptogenesis**: Your brain forms new connections between neurons. This is how different ideas start linking in new ways.
* **Myelination**: Repeated practice wraps your neural pathways in a fatty substance called myelin. This makes signals travel faster—so ideas connect more quickly.
* **Pruning**: Your brain trims unused connections to make room for stronger ones. Think of it as removing dead branches so the tree can grow better.

If you want to become more creative, you need to work with these processes—feed them, stress them (in a good way), and give them room to adapt.

# Training for Creativity: What Actually Works

Not all brain training helps creativity. Sudoku might make you sharper, but it won’t necessarily help you think more innovatively. Here’s what actually moves the needle.

# 1. Learn Something Outside Your Comfort Zone

When you explore a new field—like music, coding, cooking, or even juggling—you [challenge your brain](https://topnootropicchoice.com/science/the-science-behind-mind-lab-pro-what-makes-it-work/) to think in fresh ways. You also pull in ideas from one domain and apply them to another. That’s called **cross-pollination**, and it’s a goldmine for innovation.

Steve Jobs famously said creativity is just connecting things. To connect new things, you need to *expose* yourself to new things.

# 2. Switch Up Your Routines

Routines are efficient, but they can dull creative thinking. Try brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand. Take a different route to work. Listen to music you wouldn’t usually pick. These small acts shake up your brain and trigger new neural activity.

It might feel silly, but it works. Your brain goes, *“Wait, what’s this? I need to pay attention.”* And that attention sparks new wiring.

# 3. Use the “Yes, and…” Rule

Borrowed from improv comedy, this technique encourages open-ended thinking. When [brainstorming](https://openstax.org/books/entrepreneurship/pages/4-2-creativity-innovation-and-invention-how-they-differ) or talking through ideas, respond with “yes, and…” instead of “no, but…”

Example:  
**You:** “What if we made a silent coffee shop?”  
**Brain:** “Yes, and people could book soundproof booths for writing.”  
**Brain again:** “Yes, and we could include whiteboards and focus tools.”

This trains your brain to build on ideas, not kill them. Neuroplasticity thrives on momentum.

# 4. Take Breaks with Purpose

Breaks aren’t just for rest. They give your brain time to process information behind the scenes. This is called **incubation**, and it’s often when your best ideas show up—while walking, showering, or staring at clouds like a confused philosopher.

If you’ve been stuck on a problem, step away. Let your brain go off-leash for a while.

# Habits That Strengthen a Creative Brain

You don’t need a total life overhaul. But consistent habits can keep your brain plastic and ready for innovation.

# Get Enough Sleep

Neuroplasticity relies heavily on rest. Your brain files memories, repairs itself, and forms new connections while you sleep. That “I’ll sleep when I’m dead” mindset? Terrible for creativity.

# Move Your Body

Exercise increases blood flow to the brain and releases [BDNF](https://hbr.org/2010/08/innovation-is-not-creativity) (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), a protein that supports new neuron growth. You don’t need to be a gym rat. A brisk walk, light stretching, or even dancing in your kitchen counts.

# Feed Your Brain

Omega-3s, antioxidants, and a balanced diet help keep your brain chemistry in check. You wouldn’t put garbage in a race car, right?

Foods that support neuroplasticity include:

* Blueberries
* Fatty fish
* Nuts
* Leafy greens
* Dark chocolate (you’re welcome)

# D. Meditate (Even for 5 Minutes)

Mindfulness teaches your brain to focus, stay present, and observe thoughts without judgment. It also strengthens the prefrontal cortex and quiets the noise of anxiety—the enemy of creativity.

Think of it as a warm-up before a creative workout.

# What to Do When You Feel “Stuck”

Every creative person hits mental walls. The trick isn’t avoiding them—it’s recognizing them as training opportunities.

If you feel stuck:

* **Change your environment.** Go outside. Rearrange your workspace. Different scenery = different wiring.
* **Go analog.** Step away from screens. Grab a notebook, sketchpad, or whiteboard. Physical tools can unlock new pathways.
* **Collaborate.** Talk through the problem with someone else. New voices = new inputs for your brain to rewire.
* **Add constraints.** Ironically, limits can boost creativity. Give yourself five minutes, three materials, or one goal. The brain likes a challenge with borders.

# Real-Life Example: The Brain That Rewired for Genius

Let’s talk about Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor. She’s a neuroscientist who had a stroke in her left brain hemisphere. It wiped out her language and logic functions. But her right brain—the creative, intuitive side—remained active.

During recovery, she had to **retrain her brain** to do everything from scratch. She ended up with a deeper understanding of both logic and creativity—and wrote a bestselling book about it.

Her story is proof: the brain is not fixed. It’s changeable, adaptable, and often more powerful after hardship than before.

You’re not stuck with the brain you were born with. You can shape it. You can train it to think more creatively, connect more ideas, and bounce back from dead ends with fresh solutions.

Neuroplasticity isn’t about becoming someone else—it’s about expanding who you already are. So next time you hit a creative block, remember: your brain isn’t broken. It’s just waiting for you to teach it a new trick.",1,1743991078.0,u_Klutzy_Sail5986,0,1.0,False

Yesterday... 

Woke up in my other awesome camp spot. Got my chargers and phones etc. together. Out of tent. Sneak through trees to chain link gate. Through gate. Past dumpster. Trash in dumpster. Through parking lot. To library.

Hung there until my stuff was charged. Headed back to camp.

Today...

Woke up. Gear packed. Out of tent. Tent on pack. Gear up. Through trees to gate. Walk through like I own the place. Trash in dumpster on my way by. Through parking lot. Cross street. Head north. 

Find a good spot just past a restaurant. 'Maybe somebody will buy me breakfast.' Wasn't counting on it. Gear down. Smoke lit. Thumb out. Had to put my smoke out half way through when the first ride of the day pulled over. 'Nice!'

Matt from Vermont, ""I'm only going about ten miles up the road."" ""That would be great. Every little bit helps."" He seems to know the area pretty well. Usual chit-chat. He drops me off across the street from a biker bar. We exchange thanks and good luck. ""That place across the street has a good breakfast for seven bucks."" ""I've got about two fifty so that leaves me out."" More goodbyes. Gear up. Down road.

I get a couple nods from dudes hangin' outside the bar. Decide to go up just past the place a little. Gear down. Thumb out. 

A little while later I see smeone waving something white from the opposite end of the bar building. I throw an arm up. The white thing moves in agreement. Gear up. Walk back to bar. It's dude. ""Put your pack down. I'll buy you breakfast. That'll get you in so you can network with these people. Maybe you can find some work."" ""Awesome man. Thanks!"" Gear down. There's a guy singing and playing some tunes.

Inside. Get breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, french toast sticks, peaches, corned beef hash, taters, buiscuits and gravy. And coffee. All you can eat. Back outside. Spot to sit and eat in front of live music. I made a couple rounds through the buffet. Had three cups of coffee. Smoke. Chillin'

Talked to a couple people. No work materialized, but everyone was very nice. Breakfast done. I'm stufffed. Much thanks to Matt. He let me keep the three bucks change when I offered it back to him wich put me in smokes. All in all a good start to the day. Gear up. Back down highway. Gear down. Thumb out.

Twenty minutes later, here comes Matt again. ""I'm going about another seven miles."" ""Cool."" Gear in. Me in. ""In about three miles you gotta let me know if you want to stay on the one or hit the ninety-five. No pressure."" He laughs. I can see the ninety-five. It's close. I decide to take it. Might as well make some distance. (Hitchhike faster 😆) He drops me nice and close.

I'm just putting my pack on as a car slows getting on ninety-five. ""Wanna ride?"" ""Yeah!"" ""Ok."" Dude stops on the onramp. Gear in. Me in. ""Thanks for stopping."" ""No problem."" Dude proceeds to tell me his recent life story. I throw in the appropriate responses. Ten, fifteen miles up the road. Dropped near onramp. Gear out and on. Much thanks. 

There's a car pulled over on the onramp. Some youngsters. ""I was a mechanic for ten years. What's going on?"" Dude just got his oil changed. Left. Oil light came on, car went into limp mode, here we are. I check the oil. Dipstick is bone dry. I give them my best advice, make sure they have someone on the way. Head down onramp. 

Pick a good spot. Gear down. Thumb out. About an hour later Erik from Ukraine pulls over. He's headed to the south end of Jacksonville. We talk about morons running countries and doing dumb shit for no reason. He drops me an hour up the road. I get me and me gear out in a turn lane on the offramp. Look over to see where I'm going. 

No onramp. 'Sun on the beach. 😁' Ten minutes of walking off to the side of a side road up to next exit. 'I think I've been on this offramp before. Yep. This is the one I was on coming back from Key West with the living on the boat idea.' It's a loop and I decided to stand on the driver's side because it was easier to pull over. Three-ish years ago I was only there about fifteen minutes before I got picked up. Today, not so much.

Two and half hours later I decide to switch onramps. They both go north. Quick detour through gas station for cheap smokes with my cobbled together five bucks. I'd been priced out at the last stop. Saw an Indian guy behind the counter. 'Sweet!' 

(This next part is a statement of culture and not racism, so keep your overly sensitive bullshit to yourself.)

One thing I know about Indians in convenience stores in Florida... They will always come up with a pack of smokes for five bucks.

Like magic. Fresh pack of smokes. Off to other onramp. Gear down. Smoke lit. Thumb out. 

It's getting late. The sun is starting to go down. I've been looking at a spot across the six lane street with some trees to camp for the night. It's pretty open. I haven't seen any homebums. Some people riding bikes. Not a great spot, but I'll sure as fuck throw my tent up in there for the night.

I see an old dude pushing a shopping cart. Can't tell what's in it, but it's empty except for something maybe the size of a six-pack box without the beers in it. There's been kids riding bikes up and down the road. I'm in a pretty safe area. This is the first sign of bum activity so I'm watching this guy. 

He turns right into this stand of trees. Pushes the shopping cart into where I can't see him, and comes back out a minute later. Back the way he came. I was there an hour and a half. Never saw him again. 

Finally a guy pulls over. I tell him I'm going up the ninety-five. He says he's going north. As we head down the road he explains he's going to take a different route for a minute. Me, ""And head back to ninety-five?"" ""Yes. All the way to ninety-five."" He had a bit of an African accent. They tend to talk fast but I can usually keep up. The issue I found out was when I said 'to ninety-five' he thought I was saying two ninety-five. Guess what loops around Jacksonville?

I get dropped at the split between the ten and the two ninety-five. 'Why do I always end up on this fucking road when I come through here? 😆' I think that mystery is solved.

Anyway, much better place to camp. Nobody here. Nobody can see me. Tent up. Gear in. Me in.

I think since I got dropped right at the ten I'll just head straight to California and visit my dad for a few.",5,1743990937.0,vagabond,1,0.86,False

Whatever you do, do not go to Concrete city in Pennsylvania. More specifically don't stay at the air bnb that's there. I'll be breaking these passages up into the days that we were there for easier understanding. Let me explain what happened.

Day 1-On the road

Me and my wife were traveling to Pennsylvania to visit for a family event. We would have stayed with my parents but they were doing renovations on the house and didn’t have enough space to keep 2 extra people. Which is fine by me because it would have been weird for my wife to see all the Topanga posters that littered my bedroom walls (yes I was a teenager once). My family lived kinda in the middle of nowhere. There were a few shops but they were extremely spread out and were all either gas stations or general stores. My childhood was shaped by Rutter's Gas and Dollar Generals. Not having a place to stay and with no hotels in the area, naturally I looked on AirBnb. Normally I wouldn’t do this because it always felt weird to stay in someone else's house without them there, but we weren’t going to stay for too long and it was really the only option. Luckily for us there was a place that was perfect. Not too far from the family and only a couple of miles from a small town where we could restock supplies. So me and my wife, Tess, packed up our stuff and started off on the trip. Me and Tess lived in New York so the trip was only a couple of hours. Tess was the only thing that made the drive interesting. She had gathered a bunch of facts about the town like how it used to be a coal town like Pittsburg but the government had to shut it down for unknown reasons. Apparently a bunch of people who went down in the mines around 1917 came out screaming like banshees. They would keep whispering to themselves unintelligible nonsense and it took weeks for them to go back to normal. Why they continued to use that mine for another 20 years is beyond me. “What if there was like a monster down there?” Tess asked, she was always fascinated with mysteries like this, “I think that it was like a giant spider that kept hunting people”. I chuckled “You're only saying that because we watched Lord of the Rings last week”

Tess Laughed back, “Yeah you’re, right but wouldn’t that be cool?” I smiled, she was right, that would have been sick. I remembered hearing about that story when I was a little kid. Sometimes me and my friends would ride our bikes down to see the mine. It would be an all day affair because it took so long to go there and back. We always played chicken to see how close we would get to the entrance of the cave. I never got very close. Just like the rest of my friends I was terrified of it. The closest any of us got was my friend Rickin. One day he just turned to us and went “Watch this”. He sprinted directly into the mouth of the cave. His hands flailed above his head as he screamed his juvenile warcry. He stopped a few seconds later. Me and my friends all looked at each other like we expected one of us to go in after him. A minute passed, then 2, then 5, then 10. We all started to get worried. We didn’t know what to do. We weren’t going to go in after him that was for sure. Eventually another friend ,Stevie, got the courage to go to the mouth of the cave. “Rickin?” He called into the opening. A scream so loud and bloodcurdling that it sounded like it was right next to me erupted from the cave. “Rickin! Guys I see him” Rickin came flying out of the cave at the speed of a bullet. He was white as a sheet with tears streaming down his cheeks. “Rickin what happened?” I asked. He had a thousand yard stare, still screaming muttering something to himself. We had someone go back to get some kind of adult to handle the situation. We all got in trouble of course and Rickin eventually got better. But he was never the same after that day. I was a little bit nervous going to this town now. Would the cave even still be there? Surely they had closed it down by now, right?  A few hours later we pulled up to this average suburban house. It was kinda funny to see a 2 story townhouse after encountering so many Farmhouses and barns on the road. We pulled out our things and unlocked the door. Thankfully the place was clean. I’ve heard so many stories about people booking houses that were completely destroyed. “This place is nice!” I shouted to Tess, she had already started to unpack our things. I ran my finger over the kitchen countertop, “Kinda dusty though”, I said to myself as I walked around the house. I thankfully managed to find the bathroom upstairs. After a 5 hour car drive the tank really starts to fill up. I did my business, washed my hands and walked to the window that looked out onto the backyard. Pennsylvania has a lot of forests but I would argue even more farmland. Large flat expanses that at this time of year were filled with tall golden corn. And this house had a direct view into exactly that. A picture perfect field of ears and ears of corn. The scarecrow's post was manned by the straw puppet himself. He was pointed right at the house, swaying with the corn in the evening wind. The sun was setting on the horizon. Its rays shooting upward as a last attempt to illuminate the world. I suddenly felt so sentimental, I was back at home and it was just as I had left it. I teared up a little bit I'm not afraid to admit. My attention was snapped back to the present when Tess asked me what I wanted for dinner. I started towards the stairs and took one last look at the open field. The sun was even lower now, in the night sky was beginning to creep across the golden acres changing their color to a more sinister blue. My eyes caught onto something unusual in the field. The scarecrow was no longer at his post. “What?” I looked behind me as if I expected it to be right there “When did they take him down?” 

“Devon!” Tess yelled from the kitchen

“Sorry I'm coming!” I scrambled down the stairs and ordered dinner. As we ate I had this feeling of unease in the back of my mind. Like something very bad was right around the corner. 

 Day 2-Housekeeping

The thing about this house is that it creaks. Like a lot. During the night it sounded like the house had grown legs and was running down the street at full speed. Most of that was because of the wind. Being right next to a corn field means that the wind is much faster. Less things to keep it back and slow it down. It was so bad that it woke me up multiple times. On the third time of the second night at the house I accepted my fate. I sat up, got out of bed, and walked downstairs to get some water. I wasn’t worried about waking up my wife because somehow she was completely knocked out. I probably could have brakedanced in the same room with her and she would have never known. I stood at the sliding glass door that was at the back of the house. The moonlight beaming down of the freshly cut lawn revealing a sparkling morning dew. It's Interesting how the world can be just as beautiful in the night as it is in the day. *Tap* *Tap Tap.* I froze, my heart beating like it was trying to break out of my chest. I turned around to try and calm myself down. “It's probably just a tree branch or something.” I exhaled and headed towards the source of the sound. As I rounded the corner to get to the living room a scream came from the upstairs bedroom. I nearly threw my glass down on a nearby counter and sprinted as fast as I could to Tess. I burst through the door, scanning the room for intruders “What happened?! Are you okay?!” I was so out of breath I could barely get the words out. “Im okay, Im okay it was just a dream.” she was just as out of breath as I was, every inhale a gasp of desperation. “You scared the shit out of me.” I didn’t know how much more my heart could take of this, “I'm just glad you’re okay.” but Tess wasn’t even paying attention. Her eyes were laser focused on the doorway behind me. I turned around only to see penetrating darkness and to feel a wave of unease come over my body. “Somethings there,” Tess whispered. “I can see him” My body tensed, the only other person I could trust at this moment was alien. Like she wasn’t even in the same room as me.“What are you talking about there’s no one there” I said that to convince myself, “See I’ll prove it.” I don't know what overcame me in that moment but I had to know what was out there. I crept to the door, each step my heartbeat grew louder and louder, faster and faster. The thought of someone on the other side of that doorway, hiding in the shadows kept me at my pace. I was in the hallway now darkness engulfed the area with only a ray of moonlight illuminating from the upstairs window. “The lightswitch” I thought “I need to find the lightswitch.” I felt my hand on the wall, blindly scanning for my only source of salvation. My hand passed over the bumps and small grooves in the popcorn walls. Panic began to set in and my pace quickened. It was like a timer had started in my mind and if it got to zero I would die. I was at the end of the hallway opposite to the window, my body was screaming to hurry to the other side but I knew that the switch had to be over here. I fumbled and slid all over the wall like I was some salamander trying to climb up it. Then I heard something, well actually I heard nothing and that was the problem. The creaking had stopped. In fact all noise had stopped. No creaking, no wind, no rustling of the trees. Complete, dead, silence. This only amplified my worry, I started searching even faster. Was there even a lightswitch? How long have I been looking for one and I still haven't found it yet? I was manic. I started going as fast as I could to find it. Up, down,up, down all against the wall. I felt a maw open up somewhere. Like the darkness was about to literally swallow me whole. I could feel its saliva drop down on my hands like it was ready to take a bite and then. *Click*. It was all over. The fluorescent bulb revealed my surroundings to show nothing. An empty, hollow house. I sighed, it was like a bulldozer was just lifted off of my chest. “We’re all good” I scanned the hallway quickly to make sure I was right. “No one out here” I flicked the light back off and headed back into the bedroom. Tess was completely knocked out like nothing had ever happened. I was confused, moments ago she was upright, fully awake, terrified to go back to sleep. What happened? And why is my hand completely drenched in water?

Day 3- The garden

At breakfast the morning of the next day I asked Tess about what happened last night. “Hey so what was that about last night?” she looked at me confused “What are you talking about?”

“Ya know the thing with the hallway and you screaming from having that nightmare.”

Tess was completely bewildered. “I screamed? Are you sure this wasn’t a dream babe?” I thought back to the liquid on my hand. I felt so real but, where did it come from? “I'm pretty sure it wasn’t a dream.”

“Well I don’t remember it happening so I can’t really help you there.” She turned back to keep watching the news. Now I was the confused one. How could she not remember? Was she sleep walking? I grabbed my coffee and stepped outside to think some more. The warm sun beamed down on my face and filled me with confidence. Looking out to the farm will always be so calming. I descended down the patio, the slight wind blowing the bottom of my robe every which way. The backyard of this house was big, with a small shed, a brick path to it and a barren garden close up to the side of the house. I followed the path to the shed to do a bit of snooping in the shed. Before I got halfway down the path however a small squeak came from the garden. I turned to see what it was and gasped. Just barely peeking out from the corner of the house was a mass of red and white. I made my way over to make sure that whatever it was wasn't hurt too bad. As I got up close my nose wrinkled. The smell was overpowering like it had been dead for weeks and rotting in a pile of its own shit. It was a small rabbit, the red of its blood tainting its perfect white fur. Its guts had been pulled all the way out and laid out in front of it. This didn’t seem like some kind of animal attack, the rabbit was untouched except for the surgical incision on its stomach. The thing that was really damaged was its innards. They were strewn all around the rabbit and completely ripped apart. Kinda like what happens to a chew toy when a dog thrashes it around. I didn’t really know what to do, I was confused and slightly uneasy. What the hell could do this to a creature? I went and grabbed a shovel and just kind of pushed the body into the bushes. That would have to do for now. I headed back inside, suddenly the warm sun didn’t feel so good. “Hey honey, you might want to be careful. I think we have some kind of wolves or something.” My voice rang out to an audience of myself. “Honey?” Tess was nowhere to be seen. I wander around the house looking for where she could be. Eventually I got to the basement door. As I wrapped my hand around the doorknob I felt a soft squish. I retracted and found more of that liquid that I felt the night before. Something bad was in that basement. I turned the knob and creaked open the door. I was met with heavy darkness and a dank smell. Even at the top of the stairs you could feel how musty it was. Just before I turned the light on, the front door opened. “Devon, can you help me with these?” Tess was walking in with her hands full of grocery bags. I stood still, my head flicking back to the abyss of the basement. I stared hard and I could swear that it stared back. “Dev? Are you okay?” 

“Yeah sorry.” I walk out the door to get the groceries 

“Hey,” I said. Tess’s head turned around, her hands on the light switch to the basement. “Don't go in the basement” she looked worried. I think I was starting to freak her out. She closed the door and started to pack up the food. A few hours later it was starting to get dark. I had grabbed some rubber gloves and a grocery bag to hopefully clean up that rabbit mess. I walked outside, turned the corner of the house and leaned down to look in the bushes. To my surprise it wasn't there. All of its intestines were, but its body wasn't. “The wolves must've come back to finish the job” I cleaned up what was left there and threw it in the garbage. Hopefully no one asked questions about why there was a bag of guys in my trash can. The night was uneventful, much quieter than the night before. While I laid in bed my thoughts rushed back to the basement. The doorknob had that stuff on it too. Where was it coming from? I tossed and turned all night. I'm not even sure that I got any sleep that night, but I knew I wasn’t getting any tomorrow night. Because when the day broke and the sunlight coated the room. There on the window leading to the backyard, was a faint single handprint.

Day 4-The Mine

I was frantically packing our bags while Tess was trying to calm me down. “Devon slow down, we're ok.” I chuckled. I was so manic I didn’t even say anything back. I took the bags downstairs and headed for the car. When I stepped outside my footstep splashed up gasoline that pooled at the front of the house. The car was leaking. “No, no, no, no. Fuck, fuck, FUCK!” I dropped the bags on the stoop and ran over to the car. I bent down and looked underneath the vehicle. A small drip of dark liquid was all that was left. I let my head rest on the ground and exhaled. Tess walked up to me, I could see her legs from underneath the car. “Devon, are you okay?” I pulled myself back into the real world and stood up. Tess looked at the trail of rainbow liquid flowing from the car. “Motherfucker” her head followed its path ""What are we gonna do?” I looked at her with desperation. “We could call my parents to see if they could come and get us” I immediately pulled out my phone and dialed my mom's number. Ring, ring, ring, voicemail. I tried again, ring, ring, ring, voicemail. I tried my Dad instead. Ring, ring, ring, voicemail. I screamed in frustration, we needed to get the fuck out of there. As I scanned my mind Tess perked up. Her head snapped to the side of the house. I stared at her in confusion. Slowly, she started walking to the backyard I followed, too scared to wake her from her trance. As we got closer and closer to the backyard a sound slowly got louder and louder until we finally found the source. My eyes widened and Tess gasped. The source of the sound was a fire, two torches that sandwiched a cross. The bunny from earlier was crucified on it, its skin stretched as far as it could. It was starting to tear at the corners where the flesh had gotten too thin. And it was black, rotted, the smell when I first found it was amplified by a thousand. I gagged, my eyes started to water, how could something so small be so vile. Tess pointed to its paw, it was purposefully contorted to make a kind of arrow that led us into the cornfield. Me and Tess exchanged looks, neither of us wanted to go into that field, but both of us agreed we had too. We didn’t go empty handed however. Both of us grabbed flashlights and batteries from the storage closet as well as kitchen knives and some water bottles. It was as if we were going on a trip we knew we werent gonna come back from. When we were both ready I took the first step. The soft tilled soil cushioned my feet as we trekked on. We passed by the now empty scarecrow post that was covered in something red that I was hoping was rust. Around midday we broke from the cornfield and walked into a more wooded area. Thankfully there were very little hills or mounds so getting to our destination was much easier. But where was our destination? Did we seriously just follow the directions of a rotting corpse, were we that stupid? “Tess, this is stupid. We don’t even know where we're going.” Tess stayed at her pace in front of me as she responded. “What else are we gonna do? Stay at home and wait for us to turn into that rabbit?” I thought for a moment, “We could call the police. We could show them the bunny shrine. They would have to do something about it.” Tess bobbed her head left and right as if she was bouncing the idea around in her head. “Yeah but what would they do? They aren’t gonna stay at the house and even if they do an investigation would they find anythi-” She trailed off as we reached the end of the tree line. “Holy shit” I said as I looked at what stopped her. The Mine was right in front of us. It looked exactly as I had remembered it, the wood at the entrance didn’t even look any more rotted. It was like stepping into a memory. Tess and I stood there for a moment. Each of us calculating what to do next. Do we head back home after all this time? We couldn’t possibly go in there right? I looked over to my wife, her eyes wet with fear. I grabbed her hand and kissed her before I took the first step. As we reached the mouth of the cave we turned our flashlights on. The rocks glimmered in the light. Each step we took gradually gained an echo the further in we got. I started to wonder how far in Rickin got before he hightailed it out of there. About ten minutes into walking we came across the end of the Mine. Surprisingly short and not very deep either. This couldn’t be it, there had to be more. Tess grabbed my attention by calling me, “Devon! There's a hole in the wall over here!” I turned around to see her crawling into the wall. “Tess! Wait for me!” As I reached her location she was already on the other side of the hole. I crawled in after her. It was a pretty large gap, maybe double the size of a regular human. As I landed on the other side I was mortified by what I saw. It was a nest. Of what I don’t know, but eggs lined the walls of the cavern. Thankfully all of them were hatched so we weren’t worried about running into whatever used to be in them. They were gigantic, both me and Tess could have fit inside of them with almost enough room for someone else. As I looked I noticed something familiar. I bent down to one of the eggs and touched it. A familiar wet liquid coated my finger. My heart fell into my stomach. “Tess we gotta get out of here” She looked back with an understanding expression “What are these things.” I walked over to her and grabbed her hand, pulling her back towards the hole. “I don’t know, but one of them is in the house with us.” Tess’s head whipped around to meet mine. She was white as a ghost. We didn’t go back to the house that night, we made a small camp in the woods. As one of us would sleep the other would keep watch. We needed to get out of here. We needed a plan. So before we headed back to the house in the morning we made one. 

Day 5-The basement

We would act like everything was normal, the creature hadn’t made any direct move yet so hopefully it would continue to do so. We would still be on guard though, a hand on the knife at all times. We would go get our phone and call the police, then pack up our things and wait for the car to come. We would have it drive us back to town and from there we would get some kind of rental car or take the bus to get to my parents. It seemed straightforward and simple, in and out in maybe 20 minutes max. The only thing we didn’t account for was time. The time it took to make the plan and walk back to the house was far greater than we expected. We got lost in the cornfield on our way back which took up the bulk of our time. By the time we could see the navy blue shingles of the platinum white house the sun was beginning to dim its golden light on the horizon. Fear quickly set in as I began to think of everything that could go wrong. What if it's waiting for us there? What if it just kills us right away, no time to react. It took a mountain of courage to open the backdoor and walk into the ink black abyss of the laundry room. I could feel sweat begin to form on my head as I made my way up the stairs. The house was creaking tonight so I was able to move a little faster. Although maybe that was a bad thing because as I reached the top step I tripped. Soon my face met the glossy wooden floorboards and a loud \*thump\* echoed through the house. Silence found my ears as I picked myself back up. It was as if I had hit a switch to make the creaking stop. Then a few moments later it picked back up again, even louder this time. I stamped my foot on the ground, trying to replicate the noise of my fall. Quiet fell over the house again. It took a moment for my brain to realize what was happening. “What are you doing Devon?” Tess hissed at me. She was whipping her head around as if she were about to be shot any second. “It's in the basement.” I whispered back. The creaking soon resumed, it was almost thunderous at this point. I pointed to the ceiling and said “That’s what's been making all that noise.” Tess scanned the hallway making sure that the creature wasn’t lurking in the shadows. After confirming we were alone she moved quickly into the bedroom and began frantically showing our stuff back in our bags. I grabbed my phone and began to make a call. “Fuck…” I whispered. The internet had been turned off and we were far too isolated from anything to have any kind of data. I was going to have to turn the router back on. It just so happened that the router was in the basement. I explained to Tess what happened and she looked like she was going to puke. My stomach was on that same edge too. We made our way back downstairs and had Tess stay at the front door ready with the bags. I gave her one final kiss thinking that it would be my last. As my fingers gripped the slippery doorknob I could feel the sweat dripping off my forehead. I turned the knob and opened the door. The sound was almost deafening as I descended the staircase. Combined with the damp and heavy smell I didn’t know how I was gonna keep this up. I could see a small red blinking light near the wall right in front of me. I carefully made my way over. I could feel it moving around in the room. It was so fast it was like it was in multiple places at once. I plugged in the router and made my way back to the staircase. Just as my foot touched the first step I heard a small click. The room was suddenly flooded with yellow light, and my eyes laid witness to the horror in front of me. It wasn’t just one of them. It was all of them. They were long and lanky with sharp fingers and bulging black eyes. They were on all fours clinging to the walls and ceiling. Their mouths filled with yellow stained incisors and oozing saliva. They had so many teeth that they were bursting out of their mouths, desperate to escape their cramped prison.  I didn’t scream, I ran. As fast as I could up the stairs and to the front door. Each corner I reared I could hear them crash into the wall behind me. They were right on my tail. “TESS!” I screamed, my lungs red hot from running, “FUCKING RUN!” I heard the front door open and when I turned the last corner I saw my gateway to freedom. A raspy screech came from behind and as I reached the doorway I was clawed to the ground. I spun around as I fell to the ground and before I knew it one of those creatures was on top of me. It stabbed my side and I cried out in anguish. I gripped the handle of the kitchen knife in my pocket and drew it from my side. I quickly pulled it up and pushed it through the skull of the monster above me. It screamed and thrashed as blood erupted from its mouth, staining its white skin. I pushed myself away from it, blood oozing from my side. I followed the dark ichor that flowed from my body and saw it mix with the other liquid at the front of the house. The gasoline from  the car. I looked up at Tess and she looked back at me, she had the exact same idea. There was very little time I could hear the rest of the hoard rushing to save their fallen brother. Their scrambling and thrashing exploding from the hallways of the house. I stood up as much as I could and hurried away from the stoop. Tess found a lighter from inside one of our bags. She bent down to the pool of gasoline, it reflected the light of the moon off of its flowing onyx surface. She lit the liquid and the house caught the flame almost immediately. It didn’t take long for the fire to reach the creatures. Their wails of pain sounded like a group of banshees mixed with those rubber chicken toys.  I watched them burn. I watched their skin char black from the flames. I watched as they clawed over one another to try and leave the house and get to safety. Thankfully they were too frantic to actually make it out. The police arrived soon after the fire. Tess had made the call as soon as she had gotten the chance to. As we were being taken away I looked back at the house. Its fiery red blaze far above its now singed shingles. I started to fade out of consciousness, my cut was getting worse. Before I closed my eyes I saw one last thing. Someone was standing outside of the house, looking up in awe. Their features disguised by the darkness of the night. They raised their hands above their heads in triumph and started waving goodbye at the house. As Tess held me in her arms, I smiled and let the darkness embrace me.

Day 9-Home

I was rushed to the hospital and Tess explained to the police our situation. Of course they didn’t believe Her. They thought it was just some home intruder that attacked us, even after both of our insistence. Thankfully for us the police blamed the house fire on the “home intruder” too, so after a few days in the hospital my parents came and picked us up. Apparently the power was cut off in a large chunk of Pennsylvania. There was some kind of problem at the power plant that just shut everything down. We still went to the family event and I had to explain to everyone there what had happened to me. It probably wasn't a good idea to go. Me and Tess were both on edge the whole time we were there. But it was good to have a normal evening after what happened. We drove back after the event that day (My parents let me borrow their other car). I really didn’t know how I was going to sleep after all that. Tess was the one who spoke first, 'Devon I’m not gonna be good for a while.” I looked back at her, tears were forming in the corners of her eyes. “I'm not going to be good either Tess.” She grabbed my hand and squeezed it tight. “It’s gonna be a while before we get over this. It's gonna be really hard but it won’t ever happen again.” She looked back at me with a worried look on her face. I instinctively smiled and gave a little chuckle. She chuckled back. We both knew that it was over, no matter how much either of us doubted it, those things were dead. They would never hurt us again for as long as we lived. ",1,1743990759.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

This time it was my beloved neighborhood coffee roaster Yaw. It used to be this quick, hidden cornerstore serving up incredible coffee without the soundtrack of millennials on Zoom calls (How many people can truly work in marketing?), shrieking toddlers spilling crumbs of microwaved croissants all over the floor, or Imagine Dragons blaring like it’s still 2013. Then along came Beanana, after getting de facto banned from every other coffee shop in town from publicly talking shit about them on her feed. 

Now? It’s a 20-minute wait if you’re lucky, while you stand in a sea of aggressively branded athleisure while the baristas pump out 50 blackberry lattes at a time. The entire staff looks like they’re mentally drafting their resignation letters between orders (through no fault of their own, bless them, they are truly some of the best baristas in town) and my once regular chats with the owner have become a thing of the past as he is unfortunately overburdened by having to stare at a plethora of 20 something year olds who just got their filler dissolved for the fourth time this month.

Thrilled for their record profits, truly, Yaw deserves every penny plus more! But maybe, just maybe, we could preserve a shred of culture in this city before it’s all reduced to aesthetic instagram carousels.",7,1743989353.0,Mananamariee,3,1.0,False

A wake-up call to fellow Ethiopians.,"I’m Ethiopian, just like many of you here. Born and raised in a country full of culture, community, and resilience. But let’s be real for a second.

Most of us know someone who:

* Walks for hours to get clean water
* Doesn’t trust hospitals because there’s ""no medicine anyway""
* Finished school but still sits at home without a job
* Eats injera every day – not by choice, but because there's no alternative
* Feels like there's no point in dreaming too big

Let me hit you with some real-world facts – things we don’t always stop to reflect on:

# 1. We’re not happy – and it shows.

Ethiopia ranked **130th out of 143 countries** in the latest World Happiness Index (2024). We're not just low – we’re near the bottom. You can blame inflation, conflict, joblessness, education, corruption – but the truth is, people are just tired.

# 2. Health isn’t just about clinics – it's about survival.

You know how many families still use traditional remedies *because* they can't afford basic medicine? In Tigray, HIV cases doubled after the war. Mental health? Barely anyone talks about it, but anxiety and depression are real here.

# 3. Our youth are smart – but wasted.

We have millions of young people with talent, dreams, and fire in them – but no real support. No jobs, no innovation hubs, no serious investment in our brains. We're exporting coffee, not creativity.

# 4. Our carbon footprint is low – but not because we’re ""green"".

Ethiopia ranks 1st for lowest carbon emissions. Sounds nice, right? But it’s mostly because we don’t have big industries. It's a *side effect of underdevelopment*, not climate leadership.

# 5. We normalize struggle.

We joke about power cuts, water shortages, or not finding bread. But deep down, we know this isn’t okay. The problem is – we’ve accepted it. We treat ""surviving"" like it’s winning.",3,1743989254.0,Ethiopia,4,0.81,False
1jt9ryd,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1jt9ryd/sometimes_we_all_need_a_reminder_that_lifes_got/,Sometimes we all need a reminder that life’s got so much good in it 💫,"Hey everyone, if you're feeling a little lost or down, here’s something that might lift you up today. Life can be tough, but sometimes we just need a reminder of how strong we really are. 💫

1. **You’re stronger than you think.** Whatever you're facing right now, you've made it through every tough moment that’s come your way so far. Remember that time you thought you wouldn’t make it through a hard exam or a tough situation, but you did? You’ve got that strength to keep going. 🌱 *Example:* The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) once said that you never face a challenge greater than your ability to overcome it. So, trust that you have the strength within you.
2. **Small acts of kindness make the biggest difference.** You’d be surprised by how much a little gesture can change someone’s day. Something as simple as holding the door open, giving someone a genuine compliment, or texting a friend to ask how they’re doing can mean the world to someone. 🌟 *Example:* Sometimes, the smallest act, like a smile or a kind word, can completely turn someone's day around. We all need that bit of light, especially when we least expect it.
3. **Happiness is contagious.** When you put out positivity, it circles back to you. Think of it like a ripple effect—small acts of joy create bigger waves. If you can find little ways to lift others up, it not only makes them feel better, but it’ll raise your vibe too. ✨ *Example:* Ever noticed how a good laugh or a positive attitude can completely change the energy in a room? You have the power to spread joy without even realizing it!
4. **Laughter is one of the most powerful tools you have.** When things get tough, laughter is your secret weapon. Watching your favorite funny videos, listening to a silly podcast, or even just remembering a funny moment from a few years ago can instantly make you feel lighter. 😊 *Example:* The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was known for his sense of humor, showing us that even in difficult times, it’s important to find moments of joy.
5. **It’s okay to not be perfect.** Life isn’t about being flawless—it’s about growth. The messy parts of your journey, the mistakes, the stumbles, all contribute to who you’re becoming. Don’t rush your process, you’re exactly where you need to be right now. 💖 *Example:* Every journey has its ups and downs, but it’s all part of becoming who you’re meant to be. Remember, growth takes time, and that’s okay.
6. **There’s always something to be thankful for.** Even on the hardest days, there’s always something small to be grateful for. Maybe it’s a warm cup of coffee in the morning, a good conversation with a friend, or just the fact that you woke up today. 🌈 *Example:* Taking a moment to recognize the blessings, no matter how small, can help shift your mindset. Gratitude always brings more peace and positivity into your life.

Remember, no matter what you’re going through right now, you’re doing better than you think. Keep going, keep growing, and keep being YOU. You’ve got this! 🌟",2,1743989230.0,teenagers,4,1.0,False

1jt9pzp,https://i.redd.it/4df2gt5uebte1.jpeg,"37 M4F Austin/Texas - Runner, cat dad, adventurer looking for LTR in these crazy times","Hello there! I'm a 5'7, healthy, active, cat dad (two cats) who's just a tad anxious about the [insert any number of current events here] and is also trying to figure out how to date amidst the chaos. Let's figure it out together! 

I work in renewable energy and am very grateful for it. I'm trying to do my best to save the planet. I'm a pretty active and curious person and am seeking someone who is the same. I love to run, recently started getting into ice hockey, and generally love to explore all the things. New hobbies, traveling to cities or national parks, sampling new foods or restaurants - my interests are broad. I'm just as home at an art museum as I am at a national park. The world is big and I love learning about it.

Personality wise, I'm more on the introverted side, and prefer the company of smaller groups versus large crowds. Jazz clubs and dive bars versus loud, crowded spaces. I do enjoy a good concert or sporting event though. While I do love being active, I try and maintain a balance with some down time as well. I like to watch sports, game on occasion (mostly a casual gamer), and enjoy a good book with good coffee. I also appreciate a good movie and love going to the theater at least once or twice a month (no horror films though!).

I'm very liberal/left-leaning and would like to find someone who has the same values as I do. I'm atheist and while religion isn't a deal-breaker, I find I get along better with those who aren't strongly attached to religion. I also strongly value open and clear communication. I don't drink frequently, though I do enjoy a good beer or glass of wine (ideally paired with a good meal!). I don't smoke or do drugs, and while I'll occasionally try weed I'd prefer someone who doesn't do it frequently.

I currently live in Austin and strongly prefer to meet someone local, though open to other areas in Texas and potentially other places in the US as well. While I was exploring a move, and potentially still could (Chicago/SF as the likeliest options), with the way things are in the world I'll be in Austin for at least the foreseeable future.

Feel free to send me a chat/message (preferably with a pic) if you think we align. I'd love to hear from  you! ",0,1743989050.0,cf4cf,0,0.33,False

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction.

I missed my wife.

That was the simplest truth. It was the kind of truth that didn’t need decoration or metaphor. It sat in my chest like a stone I couldn’t dislodge. Heavy. Always there. Some days, I could ignore it. Most days, I couldn’t.

Her name was Emma. She was vibrant in a way that made you believe the world was better than it really was. The kind of woman who smiled at strangers, who brought back extra napkins without being asked, who laughed first and forgave faster than she should have. Her death came fast and hard, like a book you’re halfway through and then someone rips it from your hands.

Head-on collision. That’s all I knew. All I *wanted* to know. People asked if I wanted to see the report, if I had questions. But no report could bring her back. No answer could stitch my soul together again. I didn’t need closure. I needed her. And that wasn’t going to happen.

To pass the time, I walked. The house was a tomb of too many memories. Her slippers still sat by the bed, months after the funeral. I couldn’t throw them out. Couldn’t move them. So I left. Every day I left.

I found the park one morning when the grief threatened to crush my lungs. It was tucked away behind a row of apartment buildings and half-forgotten streets. It was small, unassuming, but perfect. Trees whispered in the wind, pigeons cooed on the fences and pathways, and the world moved more slowly there. Like time had agreed to stop bothering people for a while.

There was a bench near the pond, under a tree that dropped leaves like lazy confetti in the fall. I claimed that bench. Every morning, I brought breadcrumbs and old crackers. The pigeons gathered like they knew me. I found their company oddly comforting—routine, predictable, free of judgment.

That park healed me in more ways than one.

At first, it was just the air. Clean, crisp. It filled my lungs and replaced the stale sorrow I carried inside. The silence, punctuated only by the flutter of wings or the rustle of leaves, was like a balm. I didn’t have to talk. Didn’t have to explain. I could sit and be broken in peace.

Then one morning, she sat on the opposite end of the bench.

I noticed her because she didn’t seem like someone who belonged in silence. She wore a soft blue scarf, the kind that could be lost in a breeze. Her hands were folded neatly in her lap, but her eyes weren’t fixed on anything in particular. Just somewhere… far away. Like mine used to be.

Her name was Terry.

For days, we didn’t speak. She sat, I sat. Two statues made of flesh and memory. It wasn’t until the third week that I offered her some of my breadcrumbs. She looked at me, smiled politely, and declined. But the wall had cracked.

Over time, we talked. Slowly, like dipping toes into a too-cold lake. Her voice had a quiet strength. She’d lost her husband in a car accident, she said. I felt my stomach tighten.

“What… when was it?” I asked, casually. Too casually.

“Two years ago. December 14th.”

The date hit me like a slap. I couldn’t breathe for a second.

That was *the* day. The exact day Emma died. A head-on collision on I-75. That kind of coincidence wasn’t a coincidence. It was a knife from the universe.

I don’t remember what my face looked like when she said it, but I remember the effort it took to keep it steady. My hands gripped the edge of the bench until my knuckles turned white.

She looked at me kindly. “And your wife?” she asked gently.

I lied.

“Cancer,” I said. “She went peacefully.”

I didn’t know why I lied. Maybe I didn’t want to confirm the storm swirling in my chest. Maybe I didn’t want to see the pain in her eyes double. Maybe I wasn’t ready to know the truth myself—that we were tied together in some awful, beautiful knot of fate.

So I kept it to myself. For the moment.

Days turned to weeks. Weeks to months. We met nearly every morning. Some days we talked. Some days we just sat and listened to the park breathe around us. I stopped bringing breadcrumbs and started bringing coffee. She brought scones. It became our thing.

Terry made me laugh again. Not the polite kind. The real kind that comes from somewhere near the ribs. Her humor was dry and mischievous, her eyes always twinkling like she knew a secret. We talked about everything—movies, books, the idiocy of politicians, the madness of youth.

I felt alive again. Not the same as before. Different. Better, maybe. Like I’d been through the fire and emerged, not unscathed, but reforged.

But the lie sat between us, a silent wedge. Every time she mentioned her husband, I heard Emma’s voice in my memory. Every time she held my hand, I felt the weight of a truth unspoken.

I couldn’t keep it from her forever.

It was a cold morning in late January when I finally told her. The park was dusted with frost, the pigeons hesitant in the chill. We sat on our bench, hands warm around paper coffee cups.

“I need to tell you something,” I said.

She turned, and I saw the worry flicker in her eyes. I almost backed out.

But I told her everything.

About Emma. About the accident. About the date. About the chilling realization that her husband and my wife died in the same crash. I told her how I had lied. I told her I didn’t know what it meant or how to process it. I told her I was scared it would ruin everything.

Then I waited.

She was quiet for a long time.

Then she took a slow breath. “That is really crazy,” she said. “I mean *really* crazy.” Her lips curled into a soft, strange smile. “It does explain why you’ve been acting strange though.”

My heart pounded. I waited for the cold drop. The end. The goodbye.

Instead, she reached for my hand.

“Listen to me,” she said. “We both lost someone. But we also both found someone. Do you know how rare that is? To survive that kind of pain and still find… this?”

Her hand squeezed mine gently. “I don’t believe in coincidence. Not anymore. Maybe we were supposed to find each other. Maybe that’s the only way we could make it out of that wreck—by healing each other.”

I didn’t speak. I couldn’t. I just nodded, tears threatening to slip down my cheeks. The cold had nothing to do with the shiver that passed through me.

We stayed on that bench until the sun rose higher and the frost melted.

Years passed. We kept walking. The park never stopped being our place. We married quietly under that tree near the pond. No big celebration. Just us, a few pigeons, and the bench that held our memories.

People asked how we met. We always said: *“In the park.”*

We never told them the rest.

And we didn’t need to.",1,1743988600.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False
1jt9jt6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jt9jt6,Signed Book 49: From Monsoons to Mexican Waves: Discovering Science in Unexpected Ripples,"I never thought I’d find myself chuckling while reading about ocean waves, sound waves, brain waves—even Mexican waves—but here we are. The Wavewatcher’s Companion is that delightful kind of book that takes something utterly ordinary (waves) and makes you wonder why you’ve never noticed how weirdly wonderful they are. Gavin Pretor-Pinney writes with a surfer’s spirit and a scientist’s curiosity, plus a solid dash of British humor. The result? A light, quirky read that’s surprisingly packed with fun facts you’ll want to drop into every conversation.

There’s even a lovely little India connection in the book—turns out wave science played a role in understanding monsoon behavior, and there are fascinating bits about how wave interference helps explain the chaotic beauty of India’s coastline. Not exactly textbook stuff, more like ""Did you know?"" trivia with a breeze of charm.

I picked up this signed edition from the ever-charming Trilogy Bookstore in Mumbai—a place that smells of old wood, fresh coffee, and unread adventures. It's the kind of store where time slows down and wallets become suspiciously light. Highly recommend a visit (just don’t blame me for the pile of books you’ll walk out with).

And yes, this is Book #49 in the series! That means the 50th post is coming up next—and I’m plotting something a bit different for that one. Not entirely sure what shape it’ll take, but I promise it’ll ride a good wave of curiosity. Let’s see where it lands.",2,1743988475.0,Indianbooks,0,1.0,False

* 9/12-9/17
   * 5 nights in **Paris** (probably staying in the 6th)
   * Friday evening guided Louvre tour, Le Grande Epicere + Eiffel tower picnic, Île de la Cité , Le Marais + Monmarte wandering, and food + pharmacy + cookware + thrift/antique shopping!!
   * Versailles day trip
* 9/17-21
   * 2hr Train to Strasbourg, collect car rental
   * 5 nights along **Route des Vins** (maybe based in Enguisheim)
   * Slow down & rest after Paris, visit the Alsatian villages and castles, hotel with a pool to sit at, perhaps a spa day
   * Day trip to visit friends in Freiburg im Breisgau, maybe a day trip to Basel
* 9/21-24
   * 4hr train to **Munich**
   * 3 nights in Schwabing during Oktoberfest
   * NS Documentation Center, Dachau Memorial, Viktualienmarkt, English Gardens, Residenz
   * We aren't partiers by any stretch of the imagination-- we'd like to tour the tents early one day & do a lunch and/or dinner at the festival. We have a large group of friends meeting here that we'll book a table with.
* 9/24-27
   * 4hr train to **Vienna**, stay 3 nights
   * Possibly use 1/3 nights to stay in **Salzburg**, or just stop en route to Vienna
   * Hoping to get tickets to the opera one evening, Schönbrunn, Hofburg, Belvedere (probably not all 3), Naschmarkt, coffee houses, strudel for every meal

So far, I have only booked our return flights and our accommodation in Munich.  I don't have my heart set in stone on anything else-- still very open to major changes. This month I'm planning to book Oktoberfest table reservations, opera tickets, and probably the rest of the accommodations.

This will be our first time to all of these places. We love to walk & talk while we enjoy the local architecture, try all the regional specialties and have a few *v*ery special meals, we love learning about history, medieval & renaissance art, and the opera. I wanted to see if anyone had any advice before I made any other big decisions. Please let me know if you have any thoughts about the trip framework or particular things we should see/do or avoid!!

As some of you may know, I've been working on a fanmade reboot to Object Terror. I call it ""Object Terror Reloaded""! By now, I have finished the script for the first episode, and want to start working on it as soon as possible. Yet, I can't voice act for the life of me, and I don't want to have to use subtitles for dialouge as that would bore the hell out of the viewers. So, I have decided to accept voice auditions!

Basically, find the character(s) you want to voice act and match their voice qualifications. To apply for a position, DM me stating which character you want to audition for. Send me a [Vocaroo](https://vocaroo.com/) link containing the audio file of your enactment of the example line you are not a controversial or malicious figure, I will take a quick dive into your Reddit account posts. If you pass the background test, and if your audition satisfies my vision, you will be invited into a group chat made for the show's production, where you can chat with other members of the crew!

Here's a list of each character, their voice qualifications, and example lines! In advance, I'd like to say that ""casual voice"" means how you would normally speak. Basically, quirkless. Anyways, onto the list!

|Character|Character Voice Qualifications|Example Line|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Arch|Androgynous-sounding, grating voice.|""Great. There's only one person who ever wants to talk to me, and he's a MORON. Why must this always happen to ME?!""|
|Beer|Masculine-sounding, exaggeratively vocal fried, raspy voice.|""Despite your lies, I'll let them slide. I hate Arch anyways. What's the plan?""|
|Biscuit|Androgynous or feminine-sounding (chose one), slightly grating voice.|""Are you saying you LIKE IT when Wallet annoys me?!""|
|Cactus|Masculine-sounding, gravelly, aggressive, stereotypical ""jock"" voice.|""Relax, I'm sure he'll be fine. But try anything else again and neither of you will be...""|
|Carpet|Either masculine or androgynous-sounding (chose one), casual voice.|""Hey, baby. Wassup?""|
|Coffee Cup|Masculine-sounding, casual voice.|""Neither of us did anything to you, Cactus. Now leave us be, will you?""|
|Computer|Any gender-percepting (male, female, androgynous) vocals accepted (chose one), casual voice.|""I was here the whole time, working on my project.""|
|Fart|Masculine-sounding, stereotypical ""dumb"" voice with US Southern accent.|""Uhm... maybe! Who knows? I don't know nothing!""|
|Flash Drive|Masculine-sounding, relaxed, stereotypical ""hippie""/""stoner"" voice.|""What the heck, brah? If I stayed in there any longer, my circuits would have fried! Not cool, broski.""|
|Magazine|Feminine-sounding, subtly vocal fried, stereotypical ""valley girl"" voice.|""Girl, relax! Like, what's the problem?""|
|Mint|Androgynous-sounding, high-pitched, childish voice.|""Hey, my bestest friends! How do you do?""|
|Paint|Masculine-sounding, casual voice.|""Why can't Computer get it?! I've been fetching you tools all day, while he's been sitting on his behind watching me dry!""|
|Printer|Masculine-sounding, lively yet casual voice.|""Oh, makes sense. Phew! For a second there, I thought I was done for.""|
|Recycling Bin|Androgynous-sounding, expressive voice.|""You mean the one with the giant, evil robots? Heck yeah, I loved that movie!""|
|Road Sign|Androgynous or feminine-sounding (choose one), high pitched, sporty voice, with an Australian or New Zealander accent (choose one).|""Hey, short stuff! You think I can throw the ball past those trees back there?""|
|Stapler|Androgynous or feminine-sounding voice (choose one), high pitched, expressive, and cartoonish voice.|""Ugh, Zingzang! We talked about this, fam! Cannibalism's lowkey for scrubs!""|
|Trowel|Masculine-sounding voice with Eastern European accent.|""I'm not spying, I'm... just analyzing! Yeah! Analyzing their character interactions!""|
|Unibrow \*|Masculine-sounding voice with a posh, English accent.|""Salutations, good sir. It would grant my utmost wishes if you separated me from this baffoon's forehead.""|
|Wallet|Masculine or androgynous-sounding (choose one), aggressive, subtly dim-witted voice.|""Biscuit's having her little pathetic outbursts, as per usual!""|
|Whipped Cream|Masculine-sounding, trembling, expressive voice.|""Save it. I don't need more excuses in my life. Certain people here suit that perfectly. You are lucky I have the resources for this.""|
|ZingZang (replacement for Skittle)|Feminine or androgynous-sounding (choose one), high pitched voice.|""Staplers aren't edible, are they? Now mind your own business.""|

\* Unibrow is a gag character, meaning he only exists for a one-off joke. So, if you chose to voice this character, you must also voice another character too.

If you are wondering why El Nudelo Spider and Plug are exempt from this list, El Nudelo Spider is not a character in this reboot, and Plug is meant to be mute.

Now, here's a list of...

|VOICE ACTOR QUALIFICATIONS|
|:-|


* As the show is aimed at a teenage audience, you must be **13 years of age** or older to audition for the show. As I am a minor who wishes to stay safe on the internet, you **cannot be older than 19** either (by the time you audition). If you do not meet the age requirements, your submission will be rejected automatically.
* When I run the brief background check on your account, I will look for the following to determine whether you are worth hiring:
* \~\~\~ **Traits I look for**:
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Signs of reliability and trustworthiness
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Positive engagement
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Collaborative attitude
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Inclusive and non-discriminatory values
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Experience with voice acting (Optional, but helps your chances a lot)
* \~\~\~ **Traits I would reject you for**:
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Toxic behavior (trolling, discriminatory values, posting offensive content)
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Being under/overage
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Over-commitment (e.g., being involved in too many projects would get you rejected as I do not wish to overwork someone)
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Having a criminal history on a felony level (U.S. and Canadian law will be the base for determining this)
* \~\~\~\~\~\~ Having a history of leaking or spoiling media (e.g., recording an exclusive theatre screening of the latest BFDI episode and uploading it onto your account, or leaking scenes or screenshots from shows you worked on but do not own).
* \~\~\~ Please note that, for your privacy, I will not be looking into any offsite accounts you own. **This is, unless, most of your only activity happens outside of Reddit, in which case you are to tell me that.**
* You must realize that **you will not be paid for your role,** as I am a minor and cannot legally own a PayPal account or something.

There is no set deadline for auditioning. I will close auditions once I have chosen voice actors for every character. Good luck to those auditioning! :3",3,1743988368.0,ObjectShows,0,1.0,False

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

What do you all think about the comments? if the comment came in approximately an hour ago, and it's currently 7pm in Michigan, does that mean she ordered a pickle pizza after she got the comment?

Does she have elaborate fake accounts including posing as a high school boy commenting crazy things on her videos? The comment says coffee and pickles but the picture didn't include the coffee. did she say lunch but she meant dinner and the comment came in as soon as she ordered the food bc they're watching her? My other theory is that it could be her mom messing with her. Lisa has said things before that make it sound like they live together, and Lisa has also mentioned her mom being roped in to the FBI plot at one point before. I never know what to make of her??

*Yet he still had a 17 hour shift.*

Intern: You ever think of just...quitting?

???: I'm trying to SLEEP, Intern.

Intern: Just think about it. We can just walk through that door, find a different job, and say ""Sayonara, bit-""

*Flufferson, Geralt, and Oni walk through the door.*

*Geralt glaring at Intern, and Flufferson glaring at Geralt.*

Geralt: Have you been sla-

*Flufferson immediately gave Geralt a death glare.*

Flufferson: ...Geralt...Now that we are not...You know...narrowly avoiding death...What. The. Actual. Fuck.

Geralt: You think we can pay everybody when our only income stream is stealing from the rich? News flash, giving away money isn't cheap, and neither are heists.

Oni: Geralt has a point.

Flufferson: And Geralt also had to get help from a caveman penguin.

Geralt: My own clone, mind you.

Oni: And also an immortal homunculus powered by the souls of the damned. So...not exactly a clone. Or a penguin, even.

Flufferson: ...If you don't pay these poor workers, I'm dragging you to hell myself.

Oni: Me too?-

Flufferson: If you don't make sure Geralt actually DOES what I asked, yes.

Oni: Kind of redundant when I'm already a demon-

Flufferson: To heaven, then.

Oni: -I'll make sure Geralt makes the contracts.

Flufferson: Good. Also, you two are on Coffee duty for a week-

Intern: YES! YESSSSS!!!!!! MY NIGHTMARE IS OVER!

*Intern starts running around like a crazy person.*

Flufferson: ...Two weeks.

Oni: And no thanks for saving your life?

Flufferson: Three weeks for Geralt, one week for you.

I am new to making my own cold brew coffee using a mason jar and mesh filter. So far, it has been pretty easy, but I keep finding a sludge like substance at the bottom of the jar.  Doing some research, I understand why it happens.  But I would like to use some type of filter to remove it.  Does a filter fine enough exist? An Amazon link with what you think would be a good solution would be greatly appreciated, but not necessary.  Thanks! ",2,1743987886.0,coldbrew,6,1.0,False

1jt9azd,https://www.reddit.com/r/divorced_women/comments/1jt9azd/im_two_years_past_my_divorce_and_the_poorest_ive/,I'm two years past my divorce and the poorest I've ever been in my life. It's so damn lonely.,"Just FYI that I want to vent about the loneliness part and I'm not asking for money advice, please. Money is literally all I think about and I'm actively doing all I can, but the truth is that this is just a very difficult season for me and that's just the reality. I know a lot of you are feeling it too.

  
Anyway, I've (F42) been through a lot of change leading up to and following my divorce, and I currently make the least money I've ever made in my life by a longshot. I have lovely local friends and I'm so grateful for that, but man, they just do not understand what this is like. Their life and job situations are so different from mine now -- they're almost all partnered and their partners work, they all have good to great jobs, and my one divorced friend makes bank, so it's just not the same. 



A sad discovery about post-divorce life for me has been that if you can't meet up for drinks or go see that band or go to the beach for the weekend or get brunch, friends start to forget about including you. My group of friends was extra covid-cautious, so we did a lot of walks and backyard lounging and outdoor coffees, but now they want to go out and do things and I can't blame them. It just suuuuucks to have to say no thanks AGAIN when they do ask. Even meeting for coffee is $10 until I get something and pay to park, and that stuff adds up. It's hard to justify that when I can't pay all my bills most months.



Most of them will do something cheap or free if I ask them to, but honestly I get sick of having to ask. I know I shouldn't feel ashamed but it's still there and I feel embarrassed. And even then, they still don't get it. I appreciate their sympathy, but saying stuff like, ""It's okay! I'm broke too!"" feels hollow when I know they're not. I was really protected when I was married, and I truly did not get what this would be like until my situation changed. So I can't be mad my friends don't get it but they just fucking *don't*.



Again, I just needed to vent and I knew there would be some people here who get it. So thank you 💔",2,1743987680.0,divorced_women,1,1.0,False
