1ldo4np,https://www.reddit.com/r/Problem_Solvrs/comments/1ldo4np/pillow_ergonomic_neck_pillow_for_pain/,Pillow: Ergonomic Neck Pillow for Pain,"Cervical Pillow for Neck Pain: My Honest Review (and a Black Friday Find!)

Hey Reddit,  I've been battling chronic neck pain for years.  Seriously, years.  I've tried every pillow under the sun ‚Äì memory foam, down, those fancy orthopedic things that cost a fortune‚Ä¶ you name it, I've probably tried it.  Most left me feeling worse than before, waking up stiff and sore, reaching for the ibuprofen before my coffee.  It was impacting everything ‚Äì my mood, my energy levels, even my work productivity.  I was exhausted and grumpy.

Then Black Friday rolled around, and I saw this cervical pillow advertised.  I was skeptical, to be honest. Another pillow?  Really?  But the description mentioned ergonomic design and spinal alignment, and something about it clicked.  It was a deal, so I figured, why not?  Worst-case scenario, I'd donate it.  Best-case‚Ä¶ well, let's just say the best-case scenario happened.

This pillow is different.  It's not just fluffy; it's actually thoughtfully designed. The contour is amazing ‚Äì it perfectly supports the curve of my neck, keeping my spine aligned all night.  Before, I'd wake up multiple times, needing to readjust. Now? I sleep straight through.  It's incredible.  I mean, truly uninterrupted sleep, the kind I haven't experienced in years.  And the best part? I wake up without neck pain. No stiffness, no soreness, just‚Ä¶rest.üò¥

The change is subtle, but massive. It's affected my whole day ‚Äì my productivity is way up, my mood is better, everything feels easier. I'm less stressed, more focused, and just a happier person overall. This isn't just about a pillow; it's about investing in my well-being. And it‚Äôs already paying off.

I even tracked my sleep with a couple of apps, just to see the numbers. The improvement in my sleep quality is significant. I'm getting deeper, more restful sleep, and it shows. I'm more alert, more energetic, and my concentration has improved dramatically. It's like getting an extra hour or two of quality sleep every night.  That's a big deal!

I know what you're thinking: ""This sounds too good to be true."" I thought the same thing! But I've been using this pillow for months now, and the results are consistent. I've recommended it to a few friends who also suffer from chronic neck pain, and they've had similar experiences. One friend, who used to spend a small fortune on physical therapy, says she's seen a huge reduction in her pain and the need for therapy since she started using this pillow.

I did my research before I bought it. I read reviews, compared prices, and looked at different brands. This one stood out because of its ergonomic design and the overwhelmingly positive feedback. I'm so glad I took the chance. It's not the cheapest pillow, but it's worth every penny.  Considering how much I've spent on ineffective pillows and pain relief in the past, this is a long-term investment in my health. It's a small price to pay for pain-free sleep and a better quality of life.

This pillow has become a vital part of my nighttime routine. I actually look forward to getting into bed now, knowing I'm going to wake up feeling good. That's a feeling I haven't had in a long time. The peace of mind alone is worth it. Plus, it's surprisingly durable ‚Äì I've had it for months, and it shows no signs of wear and tear. It's a long-term solution, not just a quick fix.

If you're struggling with neck pain and poor sleep, I highly recommend checking this pillow out. I found mine on ursupermart.com, but you can probably find it elsewhere online too. I know how frustrating it is to deal with chronic pain, and I genuinely hope this helps someone else find some relief. This pillow has genuinely improved my life, and I hope it does the same for you.  The improved sleep quality alone is worth it, but waking up without neck pain?  That's priceless.  Seriously, give it a try!

Here‚Äôs the link if you‚Äôre curious: https://go.ursupermart.com/mCPz9V

I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences if you decide to try it! Let me know if you have any questions. Good luck, and sweet dreams!  This pillow has changed my life, and I hope it changes yours too. The improved sleep quality alone is worth it, but waking up without neck pain? That's priceless.

Hello fellow Redditors! 

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve posted on here, but the best connections I‚Äôve found have come through Reddit. I‚Äôm primarily looking for friends. I‚Äôm not opposed to a relationship down the road (I may not be ready just yet), but I recently realized I‚Äôm not ready to relocate. I just want to be perfectly clear about that from the start. 

I live in a small city in the upper Midwest. I love the changing seasons, but fall is definitely my favorite season (even though summer has totally hit, I‚Äôm still counting down the days to October!). 

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù, I have brown hair and green eyes. I‚Äôm average in weight. My favorite form of exercise is to take a long walk. It helps clear my ceaseless thoughts‚Ä¶well, sometimes. I don‚Äôt drink or use drugs, but I‚Äôm not judgmental about it. My drugs of choice are coffee and existential angst ;) I love writing as a way of sorting out my thoughts and I write poetry as well. 

I enjoy reading. Currently I‚Äôm reading ‚ÄúNo Longer Human‚Äù and slowly making my way through ‚Äúthe Book of Disquiet‚Äù. I love reading philosophy (E.M. Cioran is one of my favorites), literature (especially Russian literature), history, and current affairs. I would really enjoy hearing about the books that have left the biggest impact on you. My favorite novel is ‚Äúthe Unbearable Lightness of Being‚Äù and I still think about whether life is light or heavy. 

I love watching and discussing films. I really enjoy foreign films. Ingmar Bergman, Wes Anderson, and the Coen Brothers are among my favorite filmmakers. I recently watched the Three Colours trilogy and loved it. If you‚Äôve seen it I would love to hear your thoughts on it. 

I love music too. I‚Äôm drawn to artists with lyrical depth. Okkervil River, the Mountain Goats, Phoebe Bridgers, Bright Eyes, Leonard Cohen,  and the National are some of my go to artists. I was saddened by the recent passing of Brian Wilson. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt Made for these Times‚Äù is almost my theme song. What song is currently stuck in your head?

Personality-wise, I am very quiet and a bit shy at first. I‚Äôm an INFP, for those keeping track at home. I very much live in my head. The Bright Eyes line ‚Äúso pleased with a day dream/that now living‚Äôs no good‚Äù very much sums me up. But I love connecting deeply with others. And once I get going I‚Äôve been known to talk for hours. I definitely crave deep connections and those conversations that keep you up far too late. 

If anything piques your interest, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. I can‚Äôt always reply immediately. I work strange hours so I‚Äôm often up really early.

If you do reach out, please say more than ‚Äúhey‚Äù. Tell me about your favorite museum, the city you love to visit, or the line of poetry or song lyrics you think about constantly. Or anything else you want to talk about! Anyway, I hope everyone has a great day!",1,1750169404.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

However I was watching a youtube video of a walkthrough of a breakfast buffet in an NCL cruise, and they did not seem to have even one of these machines.

I look forward to Wednesdays because I work from home and just catch up on paperwork stuff, I can get up a little later, do my meetings in sweats, make coffee, run errands if needed. I‚Äôm childfree by choice, but my partner has a son who lives with us 50%+ of the time. 

It‚Äôs summer for him. He usually goes to his grandma‚Äôs during the day because BM and my partner work. I guess on Wednesday, grandma won‚Äôt be home. My partner asked if his son can stay home with me while I work. 

Now, his son is a pretty good kid. Nothing really bad about him besides that‚Äôs he‚Äôs spoiled and lazy and doesn‚Äôt help out around the house. I‚Äôm not involved with patenting, I did try to take a bigger role in his education but I got my hand slapped and told no. So I generally just try to be a good role model and friendly but leave everything else up to his parents. 

I did mention to my partner that he could stay with me but I can‚Äôt cook his son breakfast or anything because I have meetings in the morning, but if he picks up cereal or something for him, his son can make that. My partner was visibly not happy about this but said it was fine. 

Here‚Äôs the thing, I don‚Äôt really want him to stay home with me. If I need to run errands on a whim I won‚Äôt be able to, I usually like taking my meetings in the living room because it‚Äôs open, and I don‚Äôt really want my partner‚Äôs son to hear about what‚Äôs going on. I just like having the apartment to myself on Wednesdays. 

I‚Äôm thinking about just telling my partner I have to go in now on Wednesday since I‚Äôm taking Thurs and Fri off, or even now actually doing it. I feel shitty but I just don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs my responsibility to provide child care when the parents should be able to do that.

Ang sakit na ng lalamunan ko. Ang sakit na rin ng ulo ko. Sinisipon na ako, namumula rin mata ko, thank God walang pumutok na blood vessel. Two days straight na ako sumusuka, after ng two days na I was ""clean"", that was preceded by like... 2-3 weeks of 2-4x vomiting episodes a day. 

I don't know what I have kasi I never went to a professional to get diagnosed. Bulimia nervosa ba, bingeing disorder ba, OSFED ba, hindi ko alam, basta I'm clearly purging. At least graduate na ako sa laxatives and excessive exercise, but I just can't let go of vomiting. It has been... 7 years? Seven years nang fucked in the head, na hindi ako makakain without any concerns.

""I'll get fatter.""

""Vomit doesn't taste good.""

""I'll get uglier than ever.""

""Head hurts.""

""Eating is bad.""

""My stomach hurts.""

""Can't you really starve like before?""

""My throat feels irritated.""

""This is why he doesn't like you.""

""My legs feel numb again.""

Nakakainis kasi I know purging now doesn't give me the wonderful results I gained 7 yrs ago, but I just can't stop. ""Magexercise ka na lang like a normal person."" ""Eh di magpahormone therapy ka kung palagay mo yan ang issue."" ""Stop eating too much."" ""Develop some confidence."" ""Wag ka na kasi sumuka."" Some days I can stop it, hell, I had months in which I was clean, but most of the time, I can't, Karen. This is a psychological issue, Stacy, I just can't stop it at will without the urge pushing me to do it. Mapanormal na kain o binge, most of the time, I wanna immediately spit it out. If I physically can, I will never eat na. Like why the fuck do I need to eat? Why does my head and stomach need to hurt if I don't eat? Why can't I just live on water, coffee and energy drinks? Why the fuck do I need to eat?

""Be a normal person and stop purging."" Do you think I like shoving my hand in my throat just to let out this poison out of my body? Does it look like I enjoy the taste of vomit and tears? Do I look like the type to indulge the headaches, stomach acid attacks, sudden onset of numbing to my legs, teeth sensitivity, and the fact that, I dunno, I'm sick in the head? Na I'm predisposed to esophageal and stomach cancers? Na I can't eat without a care like others can?

There's a part of me na gusto magpadiagnose pero idk kanino, idk saan, idk paano. May pera ba ako? Matatago ko kaya sa family ko? And if malaman ko ba, okay sige alam ko. May gagawin ba akong paraan when for the longest time, this is how I maintain my weight? Kaya ko kaya labanan ang urge? If I stop purging ba, will I gain weight more? Can I even fully heal?

Pagod na ako sumuka.

Or, rather, pagod na ako kumain nang nag-aalala.

Sana all nakakakain nang walang guilt.

Nang walang iniisip.

Nang masaya lang na parang normal na tao.

Mornings are the hardest now that you‚Äôve made the choice to freeze me out.

Before, they were sacred‚Äîquiet moments where I let myself imagine our future. Waking up beside you. Kissing you into the day. Sharing coffee, plans, silly dreams. Building something steady. Something real.

Now I still wake with you on my mind. It‚Äôs instinct. The first breath of my day still reaches for you. But the warmth I used to feel is replaced by this hollow space where your presence used to be.

I still have a life to build. Things to do. Goals I once imagined you'd be part of. But lately, it all feels‚Ä¶ dim. Blurred. Like I‚Äôm moving through routines without a reason. The motivation‚Äôs gone quiet. I do what I must, but the spark that came from imagining you in it‚Äîthat part‚Äôs been smothered.

And I hate that you still have that kind of gravity in me. That even after cutting me out, after choosing silence, my love doesn‚Äôt know how to switch off.

You chose this distance.
But I haven't stop choosing you.
Not yet...

I wonder... do you feel even an echo of these feelings?",1,1750168974.0,letterstolovers,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôre excited to share another incredible transformation that shows just how powerful 'Style Blast AI' can be, especially for those challenging small spaces! We saw a request from a user needing help furnishing their really small living room, and our AI stepped in to deliver a stunning and highly functional design.

Here's how 'Style Blast AI' approached this small living room challenge:

**Before & After:**

[Before](https://preview.redd.it/832u7naruh7f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a389562b64018cd10d75c411942faf8a78145e5)

**What the AI Did:**

* **Smart Layout Optimization:** The AI meticulously planned a layout that ensures comfortable movement and clear pathways, crucial for small rooms. It positioned a compact sofa against one wall, opening up the space.
* **Multi-functional Furniture:** Notice the round coffee table and the small side table? The AI often selects pieces that offer surface area without overwhelming the room, sometimes suggesting options that can be easily moved or nested.
* **Strategic Decor Placement:** Even in a small space, decor matters! The AI incorporated a rug to define the living area, a strategically placed lamp for ambient lighting, and a well-proportioned TV stand, all without cluttering the room.
* **Adding Warmth and Texture:** The design includes a cozy rug, throw pillows, and a wicker pouf, adding layers of texture and warmth to make the small space feel inviting and lived-in, rather than cramped.
* **Lighting and Art:** A well-placed lamp adds warmth, and the wall art draws the eye upwards, making the room feel a bit taller and more open.

This transformation is a perfect example of how 'Style Blast AI' can help you overcome common design hurdles, especially when dealing with limited square footage.

¬†

Back then, games were good. They didn‚Äôt care about controversy or the money; if the gamer had fun, then it was fine for them. Sure there were microtransactions, but it wasn‚Äôt common. But now, those games are just gone. Every game has a ton of microtransactions, a 20-dollar battle pass, and games with more bugs than the Amazon Rain Forest.

¬†

Back then, games had work. Take GTA IV to a game like Star Wars: Outlaws. GTA IV has a story, characters, and a swing that sends you to Tahiti (if you get the reference). Star Wars: Outlaws had a 100-dollar edition of the game just for 1 mission with Jabba the Hut, bugs like crazy, and you couldn‚Äôt even be an outlaw, even though its in the title. Hell, even Red Dead Redemption with is like, 15 years old and had 80-100 million budget, compared to Star Wars: Outlaws budget of 200 million. Why is this happening?

¬†

Two words, money and controversy. Developers don‚Äôt manage game companies, they‚Äôre managed with businessmen who just say make a decent game and price it at 70 dollars even though it doesn‚Äôt deserve that price.¬† Companies like EA, Ubisoft and Activision had games that weren‚Äôt like the games they have, plagued with microtransactions. Every live-service game has a battle pass, and like 500 skins. Nothing more better than Goku sniping Peter Griffin, while the Terminator cranks 90‚Äôs and Master Chief hits the Griddy. This is why companies like Rockstar are the companies we look up to, because they can make a 70 dollar game and everyone will buy it because we know it will better than 90% of games today. The other reason games suck is because companies is afraid. They‚Äôre afraid that the games they own will be banned due to controversy, which mean they lose money. Rockstar didn‚Äôt care, when GTA San Andreas was released, it got backlashed because of they‚Äôre Hot Coffee mod. Sure, Rockstar took it out, but they joked about it. When GTA got banned, they didn‚Äôt care. Dirty jokes, inappropriate content and things I probably don‚Äôt want to describe, and they do that, because the gamers enjoy that. We, gamers will keep asking for good games, and while there are good games, there will be 3 more games that look like it was designed by people who don‚Äôt even know how to code, but only time will tell.",0,1750168945.0,videogames,6,0.22,False

**Part 55: BREAKING THE SIXTH WALL**



.



.



R3K335 suddenly wakes up in a unfamiliar bed. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month. Just as Every other Day.



For a short moment the Memories of a Vague Dream still linger in his Mind. A Dream about a Journey. It feels important, as if there was something in the Dream that R3K335 must not forget. Something about a promise to an old friend. But after just 30 Seconds of waking, the memories of the Dream are already gone. No trace left.



R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Empty beer bottles, ashtrays full of cigarette buds, empty Pizza boxes, dirty laundry on the floor, a dusty Guitar in a Corner. R3K335 takes a look out of his Window. Thick Smog covers the Streets, the Skyscrapers and the Sky. It's raining, Just as Any other Day.



https://preview.redd.it/65q2zm9phh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0de03a6bab6e81b82e6cab241605d1d2ef07f1b5

R3K335 pours instant coffee powder and hot water in a cup. He gulps down the black Liquid in a single swoop. It tastes like wet dust. Next he takes a shower. The water is cold, because he couldn't afford to pay his gas bill.



R3K335 looks at his face in the mirror. Tired, beaten, stressed. Large rings below his eyes. A fat belly and a double chin. Balding head. Unkempt beard. Yellow teeth. 





https://preview.redd.it/yk8pho5hjh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e9ac92698ba21b98662928516b6829e293c19d6

He looks away from the mirror. Looking at himself just makes him angry, depressed and sad. He dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work.





As R3K335 wanders through the busy streets of the endless city of Irkalla. It always rains in Irkalla. R3K335 forgot to grab his umbrella. He takes out a pack of PALL WALL RED and lits up a cigarette. It's the first cigarette of the day. The Nicotine reliefs his mind from constant stress.



R3K335 path to work leads under a bridge, where he passes by homeless people. They sleep in tents and warm their hands over burning trashcans. R3K335 avoids eye contact. He knows, that if he looks at them, they will ask him for money. He feels the gaze of someone observing him, eyes piercing right through his heart. R3K335 ignores the Homeless and moves on swiftly





https://preview.redd.it/3gxfcfrokh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b06f3eff975d703f53ea3fe1c24c68379a4dec3

R3K335 passes a building that is always under construction. It' a giant square area, as large as Ten Football fields in size. There are Cranes, bulldozers and an incomplete Scaffold. Everyday he walks past the construction site, but there's barely any progress. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.

  


https://preview.redd.it/cfn508gykh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e95c6ac0c8454311cf82faed313195772d579c0

R3K335 keeps walking down the street. Suddenly shots are fired. R3K335 takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs are fighting on the streets. R3K335 sighs: 

‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù

  


https://preview.redd.it/zpue1bi5mh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d376050a84cbea94cce1d5c7ed05a25e0223ee81

R3K335 sneaks past the rival gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. He pushes himself through a dense crowd in the busy subway station. Just in time he enters his tram, before the doors are closing. R3K335 squeezes himself in an overfilled cart. It's so full, he can barely breath. After the Sixth Stop, he gets out.



R3K335 stands at a tram station in an industrial area. He looks around. A bleak atmosphere. Chimneys with black smoke polluting the air. Warehouses. Piped Metal Buildings. Heavy Machinery. Forklifts behind rusty chain link fences. R3K335 ignites another cigarette, as he walks towards the factory. He clocks in at 06:55 AM and positions himself at the conveyor belt, where he stands every day. A Bell rings and ushers in the Shift at 07:00.



https://preview.redd.it/rek0qhcemh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae077e5d852f86063f21ddaae416e54293397fb4

For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades at the conveyor belt. Many Thoughts cross his mind, as he repeats the same mechanical arm movements over and over again. He worries about his finances, about the economy, about the future, about losing his job. He thinks back to the old days. He remembers times of happiness, moments of meaning. He fantasizes about being somewhere else. Somewhere nice. He dreams of a Life he never had. He imagines a stage, a guitar, a band.



It's Lunchtime. R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. R3KR0W the average person, R3K0M5 the old bitter guy, R350L the bald, muscular, meathead, R3LL0RC5 the young phone addict. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee from the machine. R3KR0W talks about sports. R3K0M5 talks about the bad weather. R350L talks about shady business deals. R3LL0RC5 is fully absorbed by his mobile phone.



R3K335 sits silently. Sometimes he nods, sometimes he laughs, sometimes he sighs. But he rarely speaks. He absent-mindlessly stares at the wall and puffs on his cigarette. He sighs and breaks his silence:



‚ÄúHave you ever noticed how meaningless our job here actually is? I mean... We stand all day just to build Bombs. What we produce is never meant to last. It's only purpose is Destruction. All that we create will perish again. This is a perversion of creation and we are all part of it...‚Äù

There is a moment of silence. R3KR0W, R3K0M5, R350L & R3LL0RC5 look at each other and start laughing. All poke fun at R3K335. The Bell rings. Lunch break is over. The Workers return each to their position at the conveyor Belt.



For the Next 4 Hours R3K335 thoughts loop again, while he assembles Grenades on a conveyor Belt. He fantasizes of a better Life with a better job. With a beautiful Wife and Kids. A nice House with whirlpool. A nice Car. He dreams about being somewhere else. Where the weather is sunny and the people all smile. But then the bitter Truth sets in, that this Dream will never come True. That he is trapped in a cycle of suffering.



At the End of shift, 5508 calls him into his office. He asks R3K335 to close the door behind him. He starts talking about the economy, about how everyone needs to make sacrifices for the sake of the company, about how he had to choose the less expensive sports car. 5508 ends his ramblings with: 

‚ÄúAnyway, You are fired.‚Äù





With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. All he can think about is how to survive until next month. How everything gets worse and worse. His Thoughts are spiraling downwards. His mind is consumed by Fear, Stress, Anxiety, Depression. In the tram, at the station, on the streets, he mindlessly stares into nothingness. He walks back home, thinking only about his Problems, when suddenly he feels someones sharp gaze. R3K335 is suddenly wide awake. He stands under the bridge. For less then a second, he crosses eyes with an old homeless man. He wears a ragged, Blue Hoodie and stares at R3K335. The Hood covers his white hair.



https://preview.redd.it/l9yzltxpoh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25cf048331f5bc121ee244757d1a0af69fd09265

R3K335 has a Deja-Vu. He turns his head straight and walks away. He tries to ignore the Homeless and forget about that strange sensation he just felt. However his train of thought is suddenly interrupted by a familiar voice:



‚ÄúSeeker! It's you! I finally found you. Listen, you are trapped in a time Loop. You experience the same cycle over and over again. I am here to get you out. I am here to break the pattern. But I can't talk freely here. You need to follow me to the Park!‚Äù



R3K335 stares at the crazy homeless man confused. ‚ÄúDo I happen to know you?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou can call me the Stranger. I guess you could say, we were friends in another Life.‚Äù



R3K335 pulls his eyebrows together. ‚ÄúWhat a weird name. I never heard of anyone who's just called 'Stranger'. Why are there no numbers?‚Äù



‚ÄúFine,‚Äù sighs the man in the blue hoodie. ‚ÄúThen just call me R36N4R75. It doesn't make any difference which Codenames we use. Your True Name is the Seeker and you are on a Spiritual Journey to find the Meaning of Life. But you lost your way and fell into the Abyss. And now you are stuck in the Land of No Return. The Underworld, that the Ancient Poets from Sumeria once called Kurnugia.‚Äù



Evening sets in. It's starting to get dark. R3K335 struggles to breathe. ‚ÄúAre you... Are you telling me, that I am in Hell?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell... Technically speaking... Heaven and Hell are not physical locations but states of being. Your Life can be either Heaven or Hell, it all depends on how high you vibrate. Your thoughts, your emotions, they manifest your Life's story. Now you have fallen very far. You are stuck in a low-vibrational state of mind and heart. But there is a way out. All I need is for you to trust me and...‚Äù



‚ÄúTrust you?! You really think I am that stupid? You want to lure me into the Park to rob me, or stab me! If it's money you want, I don't have any! I just lost my job, I am behind on my rent and my bank account is empty. Just leave me alone and find yourself a different victim!‚Äù



R3K335 storms away, as fast as he can.



‚ÄúSeeker, Don't forget this encounter!‚Äù shouts the Stranger after him. His Words echo through the streets.

‚ÄúAs soon as you fall asleep you will reset again! You need to remember, Seeker! You hear me? Remember the Loop!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Crackheads get crazier each day,‚Äù mumbles R3K335 as he lights up another cigarette. ‚ÄúWhat the Hell was all that just about?‚Äù



He reaches his house and walks up the staircase. Finally he arrives at his apartment. A letter hangs at his door.



‚ÄúEviction Note,‚Äù reads R3K335, tears the note forcefully from the door and crumples it up. He stamps violently on the paper. ‚ÄúWHY ‚Äì DOES ‚Äì EVERYTHING ‚Äì TURN ‚Äì TO ‚Äì SHIT?!‚Äù



https://preview.redd.it/czkis3m7ph7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4dd8287eae4d3592cc14b275eb2bbe0d3af3cdb2

He sighs and turns the keys around. The First thing he does at home, is light up a cigarette to calm himself down. He watches boring shows on the Television for the next Hours. Nothing of value, nothing worth even remembering. He distracts himself from his problems by watching mesmerizing videos on his mobile phone. He eats cold Pizza and drinks pale beer. Both tasteless, without any flavor.



https://preview.redd.it/jpqwo3qoph7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ccbe981803e55953b648808c150e0d3623f27bd

Around Midnight, R3K335 goes to bed. His racing mind keeps him late up at night. Thinking about the Future. Thinking about his job, his apartment, his lonely life. But the last thing he thinks about before falling asleep, are the words of the Hobo shouting: ‚ÄúRemember the Loop!‚Äù



At night he Dreams of a Stranger in a blue hooded robe, guiding him through colorful lands. He whispers words of encouragement into his mind. He shares clarity and wisdom. A dream of animals. Foxes, Eagles, Chicken, Turtles, various birds. Creatures, Monsters, friends and foes. A magical landscape. A Pyramid, a Book, a Desert, a Pregnant Woman, a Monster with Seven Heads. Something happens. The Man in the Blue Hood falls into the sand, he is bleeding from the chest. He coughs blood. He whispers something into the Dreamers ear. A Promise.

***CYCLE 2***



.

  
.



R3K335 suddenly wakes up. The Alarm Clock rings aloud. A song plays on the Radio. Escalator music. The Digital display shows 05:55 AM. R3K335 hits the Switch. He yawns. Even after a full night's sleep, he is as tired, as if he hadn't slept at all. He looks at the calendar. It's the Thirteenth Day of the Thirteenth Month.



The Dream is gone. Not a single trace left. R3K335 gets up from his bed and looks around his dirty apartment. Something is off. He can't point his finger to it, but something feels out of place. He shrugs it off and pours hot water in a cup with instant coffee. It tastes like wet dust.



R3K335 takes a cold shower, looks into the mirror, dresses himself and leaves his apartment for work. It rains. It always rains on the streets of Irkalla. R3K335 lights up a cigarette, PALL WALL RED, when he realizes that he forgot again to bring an Umbrella. He shields his cigarette with his hands from the acidic rain.



R3K335 passes by homeless people, taking shelter from the rain under a bridge. The river is dirty, there are unstable tents and burning trash cans. R3K335 avoids eye contact, but one of the Homeless stares at him.



‚ÄúR3K335,‚Äù speaks the old homeless man in a ragged, blue hoodie. ‚ÄúI am an old friend. You can call me R36N4R75. Do you perhaps have a moment to talk?‚Äù



https://preview.redd.it/tqzst0pyph7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e732cbab22b4ffda52ca6d3e4554ca77e092826

  


For a short Moment R3K335 feels an uncanny familiarity from the Homeless man. He shrugs it off:

‚ÄúSorry... I don't have any money...‚Äù



The old man sighs. ‚ÄúI am not after your money. Do you remember what happened Yesterday?‚Äù



R3K335 stares at the man in the blue hoodie confused. ‚ÄúWhat is 'Yesterday'?‚Äù



‚ÄúSo you don't remember,‚Äù sighs R36N4R75 before he takes a deep breath. 

‚ÄúYou will lose your job Today. I know, because you told me yesterday. But to you, this concept doesn't even exist. To you it's always the 13^(th) day of the 13^(th) month. You are stuck in a Loop. You are cursed to relive the same day over and over again. And nothing will ever change, unless you change. All you need to do is follow me into the Park, where I--‚Äù



‚ÄúI don't have time for this,‚Äù interrupts R3K335. ‚ÄúYou are crazy and I don't want to end up in a police bag. I'll follow you nowhere. Go find yourself a different fool.‚Äù



R3K335 walks away mumbling: ‚ÄúThat's exactly why I don't make eye contact with Hobos!‚Äù



‚ÄúWait! Seeker,‚Äù shouts the man in the dirty, blue hoodie after him. ‚ÄúWhat I tell you is True! You will lose your job Today. Find me in the Park after Work. I have some of the answers, that you will be seeking.‚Äù





As he walks away, R3K335 can't shake off the feeling that he has met the man already somewhere before.



R3K335 passes a building under construction. Its foundation alone is as large as Ten Football fields. The Base is already standing on stable Ground. Like always, the construction workers sit on a steel pillar, eat sandwiches, drink beer and whistle at attractive women.



Suddenly R3K335 stops mid walking. Everything looks fluid. For the first time he turns around and faces the workers. He asks: ‚ÄúWhat are you guys building?‚Äù



‚ÄúWe don't know,‚Äú responds one of the construction workers.



https://preview.redd.it/jsfu1zgjqh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5221b779542f5bc79696bd80639477fabde2c3f

‚ÄúWhen will it be completed?‚Äù asks R3K335.



‚ÄúNever,‚Äù responds the Foreman. ‚ÄúIf it's ever to be completed it will be destroyed and constructions begins anew. It's an eternal construction site. A project that will always be in the making. Never to be completed.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù questions R3K335, who can't understand.



‚ÄúTo keep us occupied,‚Äù respond the workers in unison.





R3K335 walks away. The Moment of Fluidity is gone and forgotten. R3K335 walks down the street. Suddenly shots are fired, he takes cover behind a car. Two rival Gangs fight on the streets. R3K335 sighs: ‚ÄúNot again... Why must this happen everyday?! I'll be late to work!‚Äù



R3K335 sneaks past the gangs and makes it to a subway underpass. While he squeezes himself into the overfilled cart, he can't stop thinking about that strange interaction. 'Who was this Stranger? Where do I know him from? Will I really lose my Job? What is going on?'



He arrives at his station and walks through the industrial zone to his factory. The acidic rain burns, when it touches his skin. He clocks in at 07:01 AM. With a mug in his hand, 5508 stares from the window of his office at R3K335 and points at his watch.



R3K335 sighs and positions himself at his spot at the conveyor belt, where he assembles Grenades until lunch. While fulfilling repetitive tasks, he can't stop worrying about losing his job, about paying his bills, about being evicted.



https://preview.redd.it/ivnngb7yqh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28a45a700e90310b1549d81ae697e662756087af



At Lunch, R3K335 sits outside with his coworkers. Everyone smokes cigarettes and drinks instant coffee.



‚ÄúHave you seen the Game Lately?‚Äù chats R3KR0W and sips coffee from his plastic cup.



‚ÄúThe Weather is shit,‚Äù spits R3K0M5 and puffs on his cigarette.



‚ÄúIt's an easy job, you hear,‚Äù jabbers R350L. ‚ÄúEasy Money, I swear. In and out in less than Five Minutes. All we need is someone with a car...‚Äù



‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù nods R3LL0RC5, who mindlessly doomscrolls on his mobile phone. ‚ÄúYeah... Sure... Whatever...‚Äù



R3K335 sits silently, when he is suddenly hit by a Deja Vu. As if he had experienced this very moment already before. He wants to say something. A thought lingers on his tongue. R3K335 stops himself from speaking it and just remains silent. The Bell rings. Lunch is over. Everyone returns to their position.



For the next 4 Hours, R3K335 assembles Grenades with an absent mind. He always looks over to 5508. He has a bad feeling.



At the End of his shift, 5508 calls R3K335 into his office.



‚ÄúYou were late today,‚Äù speaks 5508 as he stares outside the window through the holes in the blinds. R3K335 closes the door behind him. 5508 turns his head and faces him directly.



‚ÄúI want you to know this decision wasn‚Äôt easy. Times are tough right now ‚Äî for all of us. The market‚Äôs shifting, inflation‚Äôs up, investor confidence is down‚Ä¶ We all need to make sacrifices in this Economy. I mean, I just had to downgrade the car I was planning to buy. Do you have any idea what that does to a man‚Äôs soul? I was eyeing the Panthera GX Turbo, leather interior, custom stitching ‚Äî Italian, not that synthetic junk. But no, finance says it's not a good look with layoffs coming. So what did I do? I took the Panthera GT. No turbo. No moonroof. Cloth seats. No massage setting. Just me‚Ä¶ and my humility. I mean, sure, the wheels still spin and it‚Äôs technically still a six-figure car, but it‚Äôs not what I wanted.‚Äù



‚ÄúAm I fired?‚Äù sighs R3K335 with a tired voice.



‚ÄúYes... Yes, you are fired.‚Äù

  


https://preview.redd.it/s2geiyfprh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7353cf485f4f79fb3fe9392ae1ebc2770dc416b

With an absent mind, R3K335 walks back to the tram station. The acidic rain itches on his skin.

‚ÄúHe told the Truth... How did he know? This Strange Hobo... He holds impossible Knowledge. Should I... Should I pay him a visit? No... What am I thinking? This is insane!‚Äù



The tram arrives at the station. R3K335 squeezes himself through the door.



R3K335 looks out of the window, as the tram drives through polluted land. Factories, industries, Garbage Dumps, Ghettos, Lost places, Dirty rivers. Everything is bleak, the sky is colored dark gray. Smog everywhere. Homeless people with shopping carts and tents occupy the streets. After the second stop, R3K335 sits down on a free seat.



A Bell rings, followed by an automated voice: 'NEXT STOP: Persephone's Garden'



‚ÄúThe Shady Park...‚Äù mumbles R3K335. The Tram stops. A lot of people get out, few people get back into the cart. The Door is open. R3K335 struggles with himself.



'Should I get out?' he ponders. 'This is now my chance...'



Just before the sliding doors closes, R3K335 sticks out his hand through the slit. The Doors open up again. He leaves the Cart, the doors close behind him and the tram drives off.



He stands at the Gate into Persephone's Garden, where the Leafs are Red and Yellow. Falling from the Tree. Covering the Ground. Where it's always autumn and the sun never shines. Hidden by dark Clouds.



https://preview.redd.it/szam7n0qsh7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1801cf9de1c2caecf034233909142107a67ef6b9

R3K335 walks through the Park. Mushrooms, Moss, Thorny Bushes and Poison ivy grows everywhere. Walls, memorials and Tunnels are scribbled full with Graffiti. Evening has come. It's getting darker. Shady people cross his path. Dealers, Addicts, Homeless... People who talk to themselves.



R3K335 feels uncomfortable in that area. He looks out for R36N4R75, but he can't find the old man anywhere. R3K335 fingers shake. He itches for Nicotine. Most benches are occupied by sleeping hobos. Finally there is an empty bench. He sits down. He wants to light up a cigarette.



Just as he is about to ignite the cigarette in his mouth, a familiar voice greets him:

‚ÄúHey Seeker, can you spare me a Lighter?‚Äù



It's R36N4R75 in a Blue hooded robe. He sits next to him on the bench. R3K335 recognizes him. He hands him the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's you...‚Äù





https://preview.redd.it/jk310offth7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cab377345e345b3d7eedc88bb7ab951a92a4705

‚ÄúYou are trapped in a pattern of Self-Destruction,‚Äù speaks the Stranger and pockets the Lighter. ‚ÄúIt's time to come clean. Review your Life. Your Heart is about to be weighed. Tested. No one, can break for you this pattern but yourself. You know what to do. There is only one way forward: Through Change. We might resist it and yet change is the natural flow. It's only our own mental attachment that keeps us stuck in habitual thoughts and repetitive cycles. All things change, nothing is permanent. So is the Self.‚Äù



‚ÄúUmmmm... My Lighter...‚Äù reminds the Seeker with a cigarette still in their mouth.



‚ÄúWalk the Path with Awareness,‚Äù continues the Stranger with burning eyes. ‚ÄúLive a conscious Life. This is how you Break the Pattern. Even the Pattern of Time. The Movement of Thought. By seeing it. By observing the entire pattern. The Rhythm of Expression. Step out of the prison built by memories. Quiet the Chattering Mind. Allow Clarity to clean up, where there is chaos. Align to Truth. Align to Love. Find Balance in the Stillness of inner Peace.



You are unhappy, because you sleepwalk through Life. From one Problem to the Next, like stepping into puddles of dirty water. Because you refuse to learn Life's challenges. Because you run away from your lessons. You need to embrace Life with all of it's intricacies, with all it's flavors, to finally make peace with it. To end the war you wage within.



When you worry about the future, you manifest your fears. If you focus only on what's ugly, you will only see ugly things. And when you cloud yourself in pleasant Dreams to escape what is, Reality will strike you. Be aware of what you do, say, think and feel. Be aware of your inward and external reactions. This is how you break your own conditioning. This is how you step out of the stream of limited consciousness and touch the unlimited.



This is how you end the pattern of Self-Destruction, that all of Humanity is trapped in. By going within. By understanding yourself. The mechanisms of who you are. By seeing through the falseness and let it fall away. By being authentically yourself. By being a Light to yourself.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut what If I am trapped by the limitations of my outer circumstances?! My Life is Hell... Everything I eat or drink, tastes like Dust. It never fulfills me. It's never enough, I always need more. Everyday I spend my time and energy on something I hate doing. I live a miserable, lonely life. And Even when I am among others, I still feel Lonely! Nothing has any meaning. Everything is devoid of soul. No matter what I try, it's not getting better... How should I escape this Nightmare?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy do you expect your Life to change, if you are unwilling to change within?‚Äù questions the Stranger on the bench.



‚ÄúYou can always get yourself a better job, a better identity, a better whatever. But unless you are willing to change the way you think, the way you live, the way you walk, you will always remain stuck in this self-destructive pattern. The outer is a reflection of the inner. Change yourself and your Life will change as well.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhere do I even start?‚Äù sighs the Seeker. ‚ÄúI lost myself a long time ago... I don't think that there is a way for me...‚Äù



‚ÄúThere always is a way. Don't forget that. Now in our case... In our story... We will now need to break the Sixth Wall. Good thing is you already broke the fourth wall in the Last Episode, so we can move straight to the Fifth Wall.‚Äù



[(BREAK THE FIFTH WALL HERE)](https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Unseen-1/comments/1ldl01h/the_ego_wont_break_no_matter_how_often_you_try_to/)



The Seeker looks at the Stranger confused. ‚ÄúWhat the... What the Hell are you even talking about?‚Äù





The Man in the Blue hood scratches his chin. 

‚ÄúOkay... Let me try again... I'll use a Metaphor... Let's say R3K335 is the 3D you, the Seeker is the 4D you, the one who reads is then the 5D you... You know... The Silent Witness... The One Who is Aware... The One Who 'Reads'... The Observer... You get it? Awareness. Now what is above that? We are already there... So what is the next Wall to Break? You remember how we broke the Fifth Wall? When we spoke about the Dream? Taking it One Step further means talking through the Dreamer of the Dream. The Dream of Infinity. It's this Dreamer, who breaks the Sixth Wall.‚Äù



Something in the air has changed, like when hot air is visible. The Seeker stares in awe. ‚ÄúIs that... Is that even possible?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt's only a matter of time,‚Äù grins the Stranger, his eyes gleaming. ‚ÄúAlright, this is my plan: We break the Fifth Wall. This will result in you remembering it in the next cycle. You will relive the same day again, but this time you will awaken. You will remember, who you are. Which means, through your awareness you keep the portal open to maintain an inflow of Fifth-Dimensional information. Together we will then make the impossible possible. We will do something so unlikely, that even the Dreamer of the Dream can't help itself but smile, when it witnesses your true authentic expression. Seeker, you will need to sing.



I want to hear your song, Seeker. The world wants to hear your song. Because without your voice, the Master Peace will forever be incomplete. Express your truest Self. That's what I mean when I tell you to 'sing your song'. The Song of your Soul. Be authentically You. Express the Light of the World through your very being. Tomorrow, on the Thirteenth day of the Thirteenth Month, don't go to your job. Instead go to the park and sing. Share the music of your soul with the world. And if you do, the heavens will open up and the sun will shine again.‚Äù



The air vibrates. The Seeker shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I... No... I can't... It will just sound bad... Everyone will cringe and I will just be embarrassed. I can't... I am too afraid, of what people think.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen overcome this fear,‚Äù responds the Stranger. 

‚ÄúOnly when the Lesson is learned, does the challenge stop to appear. It's all a Dream anyway. So just have fun with it. There is really no need to take everything so serious. Break the pattern, overcome your fear. You have just forgotten who you are. You have already overcome much greater challenges. You are not just R3K335, this identity that you label yourself with. You are the Seeker. Remember how many things you have already found. Remember what hurdles you have already overcome. You have already found a way once. You will find a way again. Because you always find a way.‚Äù

The Seeker frowns and shakes their head. ‚ÄúI... I'm still having troubles with processing your Time Loop Theory... I mean it would explain those Deja Vus, I keep having lately. But still... Even if what you say is true... How am I supposed to remember? That sounds impossible!‚Äù



The Stranger grins. The air vibrates even stronger. ‚ÄúA code word. It will help you to remember. Powerful words. Let me whisper them into your ear.‚Äù



Silently, the Stranger whispers Four Words into the Seeker's ear. As the Seeker listens, it's as if the walls of reality fall apart. The air around them vibrates, as if the earth was shaking.



‚ÄúWhat I... I... have already heard those words before... Was it a Dream? Or did it really happen?‚Äù





Everything is shaking, the air, the ground. Objects flicker. Fading in and out of existence.



‚ÄúREMEMBER SEEKER,‚Äù shouts the Stranger before everything fades to Black. ‚ÄúREMEMBER WHO YOU ARE!‚Äù

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm working on a new idea called Loccal ‚Äî it‚Äôs a platform designed to support local businesses while giving employees genuinely meaningful perks.

Think of it like a modern perks card: employers subscribe on behalf of their staff, and employees get access to perks like free coffees, ¬£5 off lunch, exclusive discounts, and even competitions or rewards ‚Äî all from independent businesses in their area.

We‚Äôre also building in cool features like:

Points for volunteering locally

A place to discover trusted tradespeople with perks attached

A way for employers to ‚ÄúTreat the Team‚Äù with meals or drinks from local spots

And a bunch of ideas to support community connection, not just consumption


We‚Äôre about to launch a local trial in the North East and would love to hear what people think of the idea in general ‚Äî would you use something like this at your workplace? Would you want your local caf√© or gym on board?

Any feedback or ideas really appreciated üôè

So I suggested instead of wasting time in the airport, Id pick him up and bring him to our home from breakfast.  My wife and I hadnt seen him in years so I prepared a nice spread.  Eggs, fried potatoes, bacon, mimosas, coffee  etc...

We had a great time and chatted away.  It came time to clean off the table so I did what we usually do and set the dirty plates on the ground so our dogs could have a chance to polish them up.  They like the stray potato, pieces of egg and especially any leftover bacon grease & egg yolk.  Not just the plates but any serving platters after the food is slid off into storage containers, we put those on the floor too.  Our 2 dogs do a great job licking them clean.  We dont need to manually scrub plates in the sink, they go right into the dishwasher. (note, only dog safe ingredients. e.g. no onions or strong spices)

Wife and I did this while our guest looked on.  Increasingly I became aware of a change in my guest's demeanor.  He asked if we always let the dogs do that??  Thinking nothing of it, I responded yes as I watched them heartily enjoy the plates.  

My friend eventually let on that he was uncomfortable with this and wish he knew this before eating at our home.  I tried not to be offended and see his side of things.  He doesnt have dogs and maybe this was something he ever thought of.  I explained that everythign gets washed here and soap takes care of it.  I pointed out the serving platter that held some of his breakfast items was used last week to hold raw chicken while we prepped it.  Ya know - salmonella bacteria all over it.  Soap sanitizes everything.  We are not going to throw away the platter because it is ""forever contaminated"" now!!

I could tell he wasnt fully convinced but it appears he chose to change the subject.  Maybe to avoid offending us or avoid the appearance of being ungrateful.  We also dropped it as we had nothing to be ashamed about and know our kitchen and food prep practices are clean.  We apologized as an act of grace to make our guest feel better and move on from the topic & not necessarily bc we were ashamed or committed some gross kitchen health violation.

The visit moved on from this speed bump and he left in time for his flight.  His discomfort was noticeable and wife and I both wondered if would ever eat at our home again.  We trust soap & our dishwasher and feel we dont need to change how we do in our home.  Posting this here for judgement.  Thanks",3,1750168396.0,AITH,12,0.8,False

Using the Persil 2427287 Original Everyday Clean Liquid Laundry Detergent has been a game-changer for my laundry routine. This powerful detergent really gets the job done, offering a deep clean that tackles even the most stubborn stains. From spilled coffee on my favorite shirt to grass stains on my kid‚Äôs soccer uniform, it performs incredibly well. It's formulated to work in both regular and high-efficiency (HE) washing machines, which is super convenient because I‚Äôve switched between both types over the years.  

One of the best things I‚Äôve noticed is how effective Persil is at cleaning in cold water, saving energy in the process. I‚Äôve always been skeptical about cold wash cycles, but this detergent proved its worth by delivering excellent results with every load.  

[Check Persil 2427287 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b07l67z4cq/)  

**Impressive Fabric Protection and Vibrancy**  

What stands out is how it cares for the fabric while cleaning. Persil strikes the perfect balance, offering a deep clean while preventing colors from fading. My whites stay crisp, and my colorful clothes pop like new even after multiple washes. There's nothing more satisfying than pulling out a vibrant, spotless load of laundry from the dryer. It‚Äôs a real confidence booster knowing my wardrobe stays in excellent shape wash after wash.  

The added bonus of fabric care ingredients gives it the edge over many standard detergents. Clothes simply last longer and look better. I‚Äôve saved quite a bit on replacing worn-out garments thanks to this liquid detergent's protective touch.  

**Advantages**  
- Deep cleans in both regular and HE washing machines.  
- Works flawlessly in cold water, enhancing energy efficiency.  
- Prevents fading and keeps colors vibrant.  
- 2X concentrated formula for greater efficiency with less product.   

**Negatives**  
- The bottle design could use a better pouring mechanism to avoid spillage.  
- Heavy users might find the scent a bit overpowering if they prefer lighter fragrances.    

**Compact but Mighty Formula**  

The 82.5 fl oz bottle might seem small, but it‚Äôs deceivingly efficient because of its 2X concentrated formula. You need less detergent per load, which means the bottle lasts longer than you‚Äôd expect. I do a lot of laundry each week (thanks to my family of four), and one bottle still covers a considerable number of loads. I appreciate brands that think about reducing waste, both in detergent use and packaging.  

It‚Äôs phosphate-free, another win for the environment, as it carries less risk of contributing to water pollution compared to detergents containing phosphates.  

**Competitors**  

I‚Äôve tried several competing brands like Tide and Arm & Hammer before settling on this one. Tide is fantastic for stain removal, but it lacks the fabric care benefits this detergent offers, making clothes wear out faster over time. Arm & Hammer, while eco-friendly, doesn‚Äôt seem to match the deep-clean power needed for tough stains like mud or grease. Persil manages to combine the cleaning strength of Tide with a fabric-protective formula, making it the most well-rounded option in my experience.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  

When you weigh the cost against its benefits‚Äîsuch as premium fabric care, vibrant colors, and fewer rewashes‚Äîthis detergent proves to be worth every penny. Though it might not fall into the budget category, you‚Äôre essentially saving on replacing clothes due to fading or damage. Plus, the concentrated formula reduces the amount of product needed per wash, giving you more value per load.

I know that she loves dark chocolate and I know that she usually enjoys practical and useful gifts and I know that she does like to have something to relax with and I can think of the odd example of things she would like, like her coffees and stuff but I feel like I just can't think of more specific and meaningful gifts. I honestly feel like a terrible daughter. I'm very close to my Mom so I don't know how I can't think of these things. She honestly doesn't really talk about things she'd like to buy for herself much but I still feel like I should have some sort of clue for what she'd like specifically. So far my gift for my Mom is a framed photo of her and my future stepdad. Even that feels like a sad excuse for a gift. To make matters worse, I've told some friends that I'm struggling to find a gift for my Mom. I think they must think I'm a really inconsiderate daughter.

It‚Äôs been quite a long time, I know. I kept y‚Äôall waiting for Part 2, and lately, I‚Äôve been getting non-stop DMs asking for it. So yeahh... here we go.

[Link of the First Part](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/s/3KkuSpOyJi
)


We started preparing ourselves for our first meet. I‚Äôve never had a real in-person date before since all my past relationships started and ended in long distance. So my brain was both blank and buzzing, excitement and anxiety all tangled up. We fixed our first meeting on 30th March 2024.

I was raised by two very overstrict parents who don‚Äôt even hesitate to threaten me into submission if I dare dream of living on my terms. They made sure I stayed trapped in our hometown by not letting me write CUET. They feared what would happen if I ever got a taste of the freedom they‚Äôre desperately trying to keep from me. They chose my current college because my dad‚Äôs an alumnus and most of the professors are his friends. Basically, my life‚Äôs on surveillance mode.
(But I don‚Äôt want you to get all heavy reading more about their parenting style.)

At that point, I was still healing from a previous relationship and the constant emotional suffocation from my parents. But Makri‚Ä¶ he helped me breathe.

I still wonder how effortlessly he brought out a version of me I never even knew existed. I‚Äôve always been a tomboy at heart, but he made me feel safe being soft, feminine, and free. For the first time, I didn‚Äôt have to wear the ‚Äúmature and composed‚Äù mask my dad glued to my face for years. I‚Äôm still a student, but doing way more than what a college fresher usually does. Not my words, my professors' say that! Some of them even care about my mental health more than my own parents.

With Makri, I felt like I could finally exist without carrying the world on my shoulders. I knew it would feel even better when he was right beside me.

I wasn‚Äôt even allowed to go out by myself last year (not a huge difference now either), so I told one of my classmates to tag along for safety. Even though Makri seemed amazing online, I just wanted to be careful. But on the morning of our meet, I had this weird dream. She told me she wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. And guess what? She texted me an hour before our date that she couldn‚Äôt make it due to something urgent.

My heart dropped.
Makri was already on the train, heading toward my place. I couldn‚Äôt cancel.

I was panicking. I lied to my parents that I was going to meet a classmate in town, grabbed a rose, and left for the railway station.

As I stepped inside, I called him.
He said he just got off the train.

Here I was, excited, panicking, tensed, all at once. My legs literally started shivering while walking, something I never felt even when performing live on stage in front of hundreds. My heart was racing. My eyes scanned the station, searching for those familiar cute brown boba eyes. I looked at every tall guy passing by, hoping one of them would be him.

And then... there he was.

Tall, adorable Makri, in a navy blue tee, greyish track pants, and a simple black backpack.

The first thought that hit me?

‚ÄúGosh, he‚Äôs real!!‚Äù

He walked up and gave me a small side hug. I led him toward the entrance. There was a baby crying like crazy nearby. Out of nowhere, Makri said in his hilariously broken Malayalam,

‚ÄúAhh kochinu orotta chavitt kodukkatte!!‚Äù

I tried so hard not to laugh. I just stared at him, stunned. Later he told me his mind went blank and he blurted that out just to kick off a conversation. Well, that really was our first proper convo.

We got into an auto and headed to Tonico Caf√©, since there aren‚Äôt many date-worthy places in Aksharanagary and this one‚Äôs close to the station. We sat opposite each other, visibly nervous and giddy.

He gave me a mini bouquet of roses, chocolates, and my favorite....Werther‚Äôs Original.
I gave him the rose and chocolate I brought.

He was even better looking in real life, and more talkative. He tried so hard to keep me comfortable, and I could feel it. We held hands for the first time, shared our caramel smoothie and brownie shake. It felt like a dream. I couldn‚Äôt believe this was happening in my hometown, a place where I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôm under a microscope because of my dad‚Äôs social circle.

But Makri, sensing my tension, kept throwing jokes and making me laugh.
And it was working.

In the middle of all this, mom called. She asked me to buy something from town. I told her I would and added that a classmate‚Äôs cousin was with us. She said okay, not suspecting anything. I was still anxious but tried to stay calm. We laughed and walked to the store together. Bought the stuff for mom and returned to the railway station.

We sat there for about 20 minutes. I rested my head on his shoulder, feeling heavy inside. I didn‚Äôt know when I‚Äôd see him again. College reopening was the only hope.

He gently held my hand and played with my nails, softly touching the silver ring my mom gifted me two years ago.

Since Makri had only ever said ‚ÄúI like you,‚Äù and promised he‚Äôd say the other word when he truly meant it, I asked,

 ‚ÄúYou like-like me or you love me, koche?‚Äù

My heart was pounding. I don‚Äôt even know if he could hear it.

He took a deep breath, looked at me with the most beautiful smile a man has ever given me, and said:

  ‚ÄúI love you, kunjunni.‚Äù

I froze. My eyes welled up. Tears came down without warning, and I didn‚Äôt even try to stop them. (Honestly, I‚Äôm tearing up again while writing this.)

I whispered,
    ‚ÄúDo you have any idea when we‚Äôre gonna meet again?‚Äù

He smiled softly,
   ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see where it goes, da. We‚Äôll work it out.‚Äù

His train was arriving. I tried to hold back my crying. He got on, the train was jam-packed, so he stood inside. I waved, heart heavy.

But then, he jumped down from the train again,

And hugged me. Tightly.

It was unexpected.
And I melted.

I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô9 chubby girl, but in that moment, I felt like a little puppy wrapped in the warmth of her 6‚Äô5 favorite human. That hug wasn‚Äôt just a goodbye. It was a promise, a feeling of being seen, heard, and cherished.

He hopped back in. The train started moving. I stood there, eyes following his face until he faded into the crowd.

I went home feeling two things at once, sadness that he‚Äôs gone and a calm assurance that the risk I took was worth it.

But when I reached home, my biggest fear came true.

My grandfather was there. The one who only shows up when something‚Äôs wrong or about to go down.
He saw us walking together. And he wasted no time.

He rushed to my parents and delivered the ‚Äúhot news"".
That‚Äôs when it all exploded.

My mom and grandfather started taunting me, accusing me of ‚Äúshameless behavior.‚Äù They weaponized shame and morality to silence me. I somehow managed to stick to my story, that he was my classmate‚Äôs cousin and nothing was going on.

Even now, they don‚Äôt let me go out alone. My mom brings up that incident in every argument. She says relationships are distractions from career, conveniently forgetting how she dropped out of college and starved herself just to marry my dad, who‚Äôs 17 years older than her.

She calls this generation heartless. Says we change partners like clothes.

But despite all that, our relationship kept growing stronger.

Makri became my peace, my comfort, my free therapy. I was never someone who could be all romantic and cheesy, but he slowly, patiently ‚Äúpookified‚Äù me. It took almost 6 months, but he got me there.

We do fight sometimes, of course. But we never end a day without fixing it. He‚Äôs the calmest place I run to.

Our second meet was three months later, on his birthday. This time, I wasn‚Äôt as nervous. We both wore cute white tops. I gifted him a birthday mug filled with chocolates and my first handwritten love letter.

After that, we made it a point to meet at least once every month.
I lost count after our 8th date.

Now, it‚Äôs been almost 1.5 years with him. Every single day, I fall harder.

Since he‚Äôs an ex-NRI, his Malayalam was hilarious in the most adorable way. Our convos were 60% English and 40% Malayalam. But now, he initiates in Malayalam, even trying hard to say romantic words just for me. Now we talk 85% in Malayalam,  and guess what? Im accidentally rubbing off on his malayalam accent too!

He never forgets to bring me a single red rose on every date. That one rose means the world to me.

Even this morning, when I saw his selfie sipping coffee from the birthday mug, my heart did a little flip. I smiled, knowing,

1ldniw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1ldniw0/does_the_delta_children_jeep_sport_wagon_deliver/,Does the Delta Children Jeep Sport Wagon deliver in durability and comfort? Review,"I‚Äôve been testing out the **Delta Children 60009-2380 Jeep Sport All-Terrain Stroller Wagon** for the past couple of weeks, and I‚Äôve got to say, it feels like a portable fortress on wheels. Since I regularly need something sturdy to cart my two kids around‚Äîone a snack-demanding toddler and the other a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm-too-cool-to-walk‚Äù preschooler‚Äîit‚Äôs been quite the adventure. This wagon is packed with features that cater to both the practical parent and the comfort-seeking kiddos. From its all-terrain design to its numerous storage options, here‚Äôs my hands-on take on this compact-yet-spacious stroller wagon.

**Design Features That Turn Heads**

One of the first things I noticed was the adjustable canopy with its extendable sunshade. It‚Äôs a great touch, especially on sunny days when my kids need protection from direct sunlight. My toddler spent a whole day under it without turning a delightful shade of lobster-red, so bonus points for that! The leatherette handlebar, adjustable to five positions, was exceptionally kind to my back‚Äîno more hunching over awkwardly just to push. The olive green and grey combo? A perfect aesthetic for blending style with functionality.

[Check Delta Children 60009-2380 price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0c5434m8d/)

**Smooth Rides Over All Terrains**

Taking this wagon over various terrains was probably the most satisfying part of testing it. With its puncture-proof rubber tires and shock-absorbing mechanics, it handled cobblestones, grass, and even a particularly bumpy dirt trail without a hitch. My kids stayed blissfully oblivious to how rough the path was while munching on snacks, thanks to the smooth ride. The wagon also boasts a one-step back footbrake that‚Äôs simple but super effective at keeping it from rolling away when parked on a slight incline.

**Storage for Days**

Storage is crucial for anyone lugging kids (plus their seemingly infinite supplies of snacks, toys, and diapers). Words like ""expandable bag"" and ""organizer pockets"" come to mind, but let me tell you‚Äîit‚Äôs as practical as it sounds. From dedicated cupholders that saved my iced coffee from tumbling, to the plastic snack tray that kept Goldfish crackers at bay, this wagon seems to have thought of it all. The built-in parent organizer is especially handy when you‚Äôre carrying keys, wipes, and your dignity all at once.

**Keeps Kids Safe and Cozy**

Safety is a big deal for me, especially after my previous stroller had a harness that couldn‚Äôt keep my wriggly toddler in place for more than five seconds. I tested the three-point padded safety harness in this wagon, and it worked like a dream‚Äîno escapees! The cushioned seats also mean my kids aren‚Äôt constantly shifting around or complaining about discomfort. With a seating capacity of 110 lbs (spread across two seats), I even managed to convince my niece to hop in alongside her cousins during a family outing.

**Pros**

- Adjustable handlebar for parents of all heights  
- Durable all-terrain tires suitable for dirt, grass, and pavement  
- Effective braking system for added safety  
- Canopy with excellent sun protection capabilities  
- Tons of organizational storage  

**Areas of Concern**

- The wagon‚Äôs folded size, while compact, doesn't fit easily in sedans with limited trunk space.  
- It requires both hands to collapse fully, which can be a hassle when managing kids simultaneously.  
- Weighing 33 lbs., it's manageable but might feel heavy for certain users.  

**Performance vs. Competitors**

Considering the fierce competition in the stroller wagon category, I compared this product to the **Evenflo Pivot Xplore All-Terrain Stroller Wagon** and the **Keenz 7S Stroller Wagon**. The Delta Children model excels in its storage capacity and ride smoothness over uneven surfaces. While the Evenflo Pivot Xplore has a sleeker folding mechanism and is much lighter to lift, it doesn't perform as well on rugged terrains. On the other hand, the Keenz 7S Stroller Wagon dazzles with tons of accessories but comes at a premium cost that might not be justified unless you‚Äôre looking for ultra-luxury.

**Smart Spending**

If you‚Äôre constantly moving between weekend park visits and storing your stroller indoors, the balance of features here definitely makes it worth the investment. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option, the durable materials and thoughtfulness in design make this a long-term purchase that could easily grow with your kids. The fact that it‚Äôs compatible with a variety of car seats adds even more utility, though you need to purchase the adapter separately.

[HiBREW H10A]","Greetings, I got an HiBREW H10A a few days ago, I still haven't tinkered with the opv valve so in order to keep the brew pressure in the 9-12bar range I have to grind coarse enough to have the shots run fast

I use a 15g VST basket that I fill with with 15g of dark roast coffee, and it takes ~15s from pump start to have 30g in the cup (it gets to ~35g in another ~10s if I let the cup catch the last drops from the basket after I stop the shot)

The strange thing is that despite the shots being so fast, they still taste good, yeah maybe they could be a touch more extracted but let's say they are shots that I'd be happy to be served in a cafe (they are less bitter than what I get in a regular cafe, and more sweet and balanced than what I get in the ""third wave"" cafes here)

Honestly I don't know what to make of it because this is contrary to everything I've ever read about espresso, I know about turbo shots but shouldn't they be longer ratio and only work with light roasts?

Idk if I should leave everything like this or if I should open the machine and play with the opv valve

As I said this is with dark roast coffee from a local roaster, I tried to do some shots with a light roast specialty coffee meant for filter and while I can get somewhere close to a drinkable shot (battery acid with a hint of fruits lol), that coffee definitely needs to be ground finer but if I do so then the pressure skyrockets all the way to 20bar",3,1750167530.0,espresso,9,1.0,False

I chose to buy Lelit Anna (with PID), but I'm quite confused about the grider for it. I try to pick between these two in the title and it seems Eureka one is nice for espresso, but not for alternative breweing methods (like pourover). After some recearch I found that most espresso grinders are not suitable for this and changing the grind can be very inconvenient. So DF64 seems more universal but I don't even know about this. WIll it be a better choice to buy espresso grinder first and then buy a separate one for alternative brewing? Comandante C40 seems very expensive for me, but how about Timemore Chestnut C3?

J. Huston Tavern has been in Arrow Rock since 1834, continuously serving the village for nearly 200 years with a few short interruptions.

It briefly shut its doors in 2024 during management changes, but reopened last July with a vision of preserving the tavern‚Äôs history while also improving the space to create an elevated experience.

This year, after enduring various upheavals, including a serious fire in 2019, the tavern made MarketBeat.com‚Äôs list of inspiring business comebacks.

Leslie Huston was instrumental in the restaurant‚Äôs reopening after it appeared that the restaurant might close for good. Her husband is a sixth-generation descendant of Judge Joseph Huston, who built the tavern as his family home before the Civil War.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve completely reimagined the space,‚Äù Huston said.

The tavern now has fresh paint, new furniture and a full bar with a variety of cocktails and spirits. The front of house also includes a mercantile store stocked with groceries, camping necessities and seasonal items.

Antiques and original paintings, several from the original Huston home, are prominently displayed on the first floor. The second floor has also been restored, and visitors can see the family‚Äôs first living quarters.

The kitchen is headed by chef Daniel Ellis, who has repurposed the menu to build on the tavern‚Äôs reputation for serving classic American dishes like fried chicken, country cured ham and smoked brisket.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to be a diner. We don‚Äôt want to be just ‚Äòthe tavern.‚Äô We want to be a destination,‚Äù Ellis said.

Dinner is served at the tavern on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays with brunch available on Sundays. A buffet is set up when the local Lyceum Theatre in Arrow Rock has scheduled productions.

Appetizers have been upgraded to include a charcuterie board, roasted potatoes and a plate of creamed cheese with roasted tomatoes and fennel. An entree may be pork tenderloin, seared tuna, steak or bison burger, hearty meat stew, pasta or the popular fried chicken.

Sunday brunch has become a staple at the tavern with classic breakfast plates like pancakes and omelettes, but also handheld breakfast pies and a green chili pork bowl.

Many of the ingredients are locally sourced, and the food is now prepared entirely from scratch, which wasn‚Äôt fully the case before Ellis arrived. He has also made the menu more accommodating, especially for vegan and gluten-free diners.

A storied history
After closing in early 2024, the future of the tavern was uncertain. The historic building has been owned by the state since 1923, and management is arranged by contracting outside operators.

For five years before it closed, the restaurant had been run by the Friends of Arrow Rock, a nonprofit dedicated to the preservation of the town‚Äôs historic properties. But in February 2024, the group ended its agreement with the state to manage the tavern.

Last spring, Leslie Huston created the J. Huston Tavern Society to preserve and maintain the tavern and its history. Huston said the generosity of her family, the community and board members helped kickstart the reopening.

‚ÄúIt was kind of an uphill battle for us to get started and get word out there that we‚Äôre reopened and under new management,‚Äù Huston said. ‚ÄúSo many things have happened within the walls of that tavern, and we want to keep that history alive.‚Äù


The next step was finding a chef. Ellis had been a sous-chef at a number country clubs before he was hired to oversee the kitchen.

‚ÄúDaniel has come in and really just taken some ownership in the success,‚Äù Huston said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in there just giving it 110% while providing amazing food and amazing leadership in the kitchen.‚Äù

Savannah Squires has worked at the tavern on and off for 30 years as a dishwasher, busser and waitress. She now runs the front of house at J. Huston Tavern.

‚ÄúIn the past, it‚Äôs been kind of rough, but now with the board and the new nonprofit running it, it‚Äôs been great,‚Äù Squires said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre set to go and really excited about it.‚Äù

Serving the community
A crucial aspect of the tavern‚Äôs business comes from visitors to the Lyceum Theatre, which runs stage performances throughout the year.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just kind of hard to wrap your brain around what it‚Äôs like in Arrow Rock when the theater is in season,‚Äù Huston said. ‚ÄúI told Daniel ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get you through a season, and you‚Äôll have a better idea about it.‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to get through one season. I want to get through 10.‚Äô‚Äù

On days when there are performances, the tavern runs a buffet to accommodate more visitors and get them to the theater in time for the show.

‚ÄúHaving the buffet, we‚Äôre able to rotate tables quicker, so we‚Äôre able to serve more of the community,‚Äù Squires said.

Elizabeth Bellamy has eaten at the restaurant several times and stopped in before a recent showing of ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù this month at the Lyceum Theatre to sample the buffet.

‚ÄúI love how it‚Äôs a nice balance of tradition and innovation,‚Äù Bellamy said. ‚ÄúPeople who have visited the town are coming in because they‚Äôre hearing great things about the restaurant and the theater.‚Äù

Ellis said he is still adjusting to the theater season, but as a self-described ‚Äúsmall town kind of guy,‚Äù he likes being immersed in the Arrow Rock community. Collaboration from other businesses, such as the restaurant Catalpa and Bingham‚Äôs Coffee House, have also contributed to the community and helped Ellis settle in.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to feel that and to be a part of the community,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey definitely make me feel welcome and tell me I‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù

At this time of year, the tavern is approaching its busiest season. As theater productions ramp up, tourists arrive to visit the historic town and campsites fill, Huston said she is optimistic about the future of her family‚Äôs restaurant.

J. Huston Tavern has been in Arrow Rock since 1834, continuously serving the village for nearly 200 years with a few short interruptions.

It briefly shut its doors in 2024 during management changes, but reopened last July with a vision of preserving the tavern‚Äôs history while also improving the space to create an elevated experience.

This year, after enduring various upheavals, including a serious fire in 2019, the tavern made MarketBeat.com‚Äôs list of inspiring business comebacks.

Leslie Huston was instrumental in the restaurant‚Äôs reopening after it appeared that the restaurant might close for good. Her husband is a sixth-generation descendant of Judge Joseph Huston, who built the tavern as his family home before the Civil War.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve completely reimagined the space,‚Äù Huston said.

The tavern now has fresh paint, new furniture and a full bar with a variety of cocktails and spirits. The front of house also includes a mercantile store stocked with groceries, camping necessities and seasonal items.

Antiques and original paintings, several from the original Huston home, are prominently displayed on the first floor. The second floor has also been restored, and visitors can see the family‚Äôs first living quarters.

The kitchen is headed by chef Daniel Ellis, who has repurposed the menu to build on the tavern‚Äôs reputation for serving classic American dishes like fried chicken, country cured ham and smoked brisket.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to be a diner. We don‚Äôt want to be just ‚Äòthe tavern.‚Äô We want to be a destination,‚Äù Ellis said.

Dinner is served at the tavern on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays with brunch available on Sundays. A buffet is set up when the local Lyceum Theatre in Arrow Rock has scheduled productions.

Appetizers have been upgraded to include a charcuterie board, roasted potatoes and a plate of creamed cheese with roasted tomatoes and fennel. An entree may be pork tenderloin, seared tuna, steak or bison burger, hearty meat stew, pasta or the popular fried chicken.

Sunday brunch has become a staple at the tavern with classic breakfast plates like pancakes and omelettes, but also handheld breakfast pies and a green chili pork bowl.

Many of the ingredients are locally sourced, and the food is now prepared entirely from scratch, which wasn‚Äôt fully the case before Ellis arrived. He has also made the menu more accommodating, especially for vegan and gluten-free diners.

A storied history
After closing in early 2024, the future of the tavern was uncertain. The historic building has been owned by the state since 1923, and management is arranged by contracting outside operators.

For five years before it closed, the restaurant had been run by the Friends of Arrow Rock, a nonprofit dedicated to the preservation of the town‚Äôs historic properties. But in February 2024, the group ended its agreement with the state to manage the tavern.

Last spring, Leslie Huston created the J. Huston Tavern Society to preserve and maintain the tavern and its history. Huston said the generosity of her family, the community and board members helped kickstart the reopening.

‚ÄúIt was kind of an uphill battle for us to get started and get word out there that we‚Äôre reopened and under new management,‚Äù Huston said. ‚ÄúSo many things have happened within the walls of that tavern, and we want to keep that history alive.‚Äù


The next step was finding a chef. Ellis had been a sous-chef at a number country clubs before he was hired to oversee the kitchen.

‚ÄúDaniel has come in and really just taken some ownership in the success,‚Äù Huston said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in there just giving it 110% while providing amazing food and amazing leadership in the kitchen.‚Äù

Running the business side of a restaurant, however, was new to Ellis. Keeping track of numbers was not a big deal at country clubs, which are ‚Äúbuilt to lose money,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still learning, and that‚Äôs part of the business,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care how old you are or how many how many stars you got, you‚Äôve got to learn something every day.‚Äù

Savannah Squires has worked at the tavern on and off for 30 years as a dishwasher, busser and waitress. She now runs the front of house at J. Huston Tavern.

‚ÄúIn the past, it‚Äôs been kind of rough, but now with the board and the new nonprofit running it, it‚Äôs been great,‚Äù Squires said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre set to go and really excited about it.‚Äù

1ldn2vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1ldn2vt/my_team_tested_1000_ad_creatives_in_the_last_30/,My Team Tested 1000+ Ad Creatives In The Last 30 Days - Here Are The Top 5 Performing Concepts. (Part 1 - Images),"Good day, Redditors,

My team has tested over 1500 ads in the last 30 days, and out of those 1500+ ads, 1051 were image ads, which is approximately 200+ ad concepts, in the last 30 days. Each ad concept contains 3-6 ads.

Here are the best-performing ad concept ideas that worked for us the most.

1. WARNING AD CONCEPT - GREAT FOR PATTERN INTERRUPT.

Here are a few examples.

* [MUDWTR](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/xlaQY4GnBgdLP2cQsxZp?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)
* [Magic Mind](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/iKRUvZzGBVY3deW5Ugp6?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)

When considering an ad, the job is to pattern interrupt the scroll, and this concept does it really well. You rarely see a completely black screen that calls out - warning, clicking on this ad could improve your ""desire"".

We took the example from MUDWTR and tested it for some of our clients, and it worked well.

It doesn't matter what you sell, clothes, jewelry, supplements, or something else. This concept can be applied to everyone.

2) THIS IS NOT AD CONCEPT - A PRODUCT THAT OTHER PEOPLE KNOW.

Here are a few examples:

* [Ozempic](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/viRjZBQaKtdI8YxVA2LM?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)
* [Adderall](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/xUs5H2nfHnZhPUU2yTYu?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)
* [Coffee](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/OgwZtsdOmWtotjX1rJbF?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)

This concept is used to compare the product against something that people know is bad but use anyway.

Works all day for many brands, don't just copy these 1:1, create your own variations. This worked for many of our clients. For one of the ad accounts, this concept was one of the best-performing ones and generated hundreds of thousands in sales.

3) US vs THEM AD CONCEPT - GREAT FOR SOLUTION AND PRODUCT-AWARE STAGE

Here are few a examples:

* [WILD Example](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/C0yEvogdcd6pHLcHVqQr?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)
* [Rose Skin Co](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/IdVId6eZAQxCfO7TgWXR?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)
* [Transparent labs](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/Zi5LnwPbJCe89Hvm0McY?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)

This ad concept is used in all of our ad accounts, it works for everyone you just need to find your own version. Whenever we have tested this for our clients and our own brands, it has always worked.

Your customers are likely to compare your products to your competitors anyway, so help them with the comparison.

4) NEWS ADS - PEOPLE CONSUME NEWS A LOT, USE IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

Here are a few examples:

* [Clothing brand](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/rajUVdZ3bgvgrmVeh3Rx?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)
* [Rose Skin](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/Xcpga8ewUg0qe4ctAuhp?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)
* [Supplement](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/PYU3G1sfQSrkhUuoxH0z?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)

This is also one of those ad concepts where we test living sh\*\* out of, because it works. People consume news, it's your job to know which news outlets, magazines your customers read the most.

This concept works for all of the brands, it's important to use the one that your buyer persona consumes.

5) POST NOTE

Here are a few examples:

* [Rose skin co](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/4SwmFMxptIwbRJlPEH5R?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)
* [Rose skin co](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/qaoq0XREFywHf2Pjtc4L?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)
* [OBVI](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/UVhBFTrbiM4mLPmOttL0?user=gaPuV3QwnURTSA79mwT1P91snxz1)

There is a reason why many brands test the hell out of this ad concept. It works for the most part for everyone; it's not an ad that you see every day. Many people use sticky notes in their daily lives.

All of this concepts perform well when it comes down to the awareness stages you can use with these.

Experiment with these and let me know how it goes.

Hopefully, you found this post valuable. I would love to hear your thoughts about the creative examples and how you would implement them.

Thanks for reading.

See you in the next one.",3,1750166761.0,FacebookAds,2,1.0,False

Like many, I once went on Google and searched for ""best earbuds 2024"" and everywhere I went, these fucking things had 10 star reviews, reddit, tech forums, YouTube. Everywhere. These things were always top runner.

They. Fucking. Suck.

1) touch sensitive pause/resume means these fucking things just play anyway when you take them off. Someone asks you a question? Well they're hearing your music now because your palm is skin, so that must mean ""resume music"". You must always put them back in the case even if you're just grabbing a coffee and need to speak to someone quickly.

2) interference. These things CONSTANTLY make warbled/robotic noises because of local interference. You might say ""all earbuds suffer that"" well my old ones didn't. I won't name them because then this post looks like astroturfing.

3) are they charging? Are they charged? You won't know until you use them because the shitty case only has one light and orange can mean case is low on battery or the earbuds are charging... Could mean anything. I just took them out to use them and the left earbuds charged to 100 and the right didn't charge at all.

4) the buds are made of foam. You cannot clean them without degrading them severely. Which means they're essentially single use and you need to keep buying them otherwise they'll get GROTTY.

5) the app is honestly just bloatware. The noise cancelling is mid at best and honestly, the only thing I like about these things is the hear-through. It's exceptionally clear and easy to have conversations through them. But that's about it. The right earbuds shows 0% but the left shows 100%. But get this. The left one only turns on for 5 seconds before ""beep boop"" off it goes. 

Any website. Any reviewer. Any post that glazes any Sony earbuds from now on in perpetuity will be ip fucking blocked by my firewall. These are the most over-priced, over designed and useless fucking things I've ever bought.

Buy earbuds with actual buttons. Not this garbage wannabe minority report garbage. ",1,1750165721.0,Earbuds,1,0.67,False
1ldmnsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTroubleshooters/comments/1ldmnsy/mycotoxins_in_coffee_what_you_should_know_before/,Mycotoxins in Coffee? What You Should Know Before Your Next Cup,">*This is a quick insight from the article* [*Mold Free Coffee‚Äã‚Äã*](https://spoons.wiki/mold-free-coffee)

# 1. Understanding Mold-Free Coffee: A Healthier Choice

* Mold-free coffee is carefully processed to prevent mold growth.
* Mold in coffee can produce mycotoxins, which are harmful toxins.
* These toxins can cause health issues like fatigue, digestive discomfort, and immune system suppression.
* Mold-free coffee ensures fewer toxins, resulting in a cleaner and safer cup.

# 2. Why Mycotoxins Are a Concern

* Mycotoxins, especially ochratoxin-A, are common toxins found in moldy coffee.
* These toxins form when coffee beans are improperly harvested or stored.
* Roasting can reduce mycotoxins, but some consumers prefer to avoid them entirely by choosing mycotoxin-tested coffee.
* Long-term exposure to mycotoxins can lead to serious health issues, including kidney damage and immune suppression.

# 3. Organic Certification Doesn‚Äôt Always Guarantee Mold-Free Coffee

* Organic coffee doesn't automatically mean mold-free coffee.
* Even organic coffee can contain mycotoxins if not processed or stored properly.
* Look for brands that go beyond organic certification and test their coffee for mold and mycotoxins.
* Certifications like ""mold-free"" or ""mycotoxin-free"" testing are more reliable indicators of a clean coffee.

# 4. The Importance of Third-Party Testing

* Top-quality coffee brands undergo third-party lab testing for mold and mycotoxins.
* Lab testing ensures purity and safety, providing consumers with peace of mind.
* Testing should include screenings for mold, mycotoxins, heavy metals, and other contaminants.
* Look for companies that publish their testing results and test their products regularly.

# 5. Specialty Grade vs. Commodity Coffee: The Key Difference

* Specialty-grade coffee (scoring above 80 points) is subjected to stricter quality control.
* These coffees are inspected for mold, mycotoxins, and defects, ensuring higher purity.
* Commodity coffees, which are cheaper, typically lack the same level of quality control and are more prone to mold contamination.
* Specialty-grade coffee offers clearer flavors and lower exposure to harmful toxins.

# 6. Why Harvesting and Storage Matter

* Harvesting and storage conditions play a crucial role in mold development.
* Coffee cherries that fall to the ground or are poorly dried are more likely to develop mold.
* Coffee beans must be dried to less than 11% moisture to avoid mold growth.
* Ideal harvesting conditions and careful processing minimize mold risk and improve overall coffee quality.

# 7. Environmental Conditions and Climate Change

* Humid environments and high temperatures encourage mold growth in coffee beans.
* Climate change could increase the prevalence of aflatoxin-producing fungi in coffee crops.
* Coffee transportation in permeable burlap bags and improper storage conditions also increase contamination risk.
* Specialty coffee beans are often better protected against these environmental risks.

# 8. How to Spot Clean, Mold-Free Coffee

* Look for labels like ""mold-free,"" ""mycotoxin-tested,"" and ""third-party tested.""
* Certifications like USDA Organic and Specialty Grade offer quality assurance but aren‚Äôt enough on their own.
* Always check for transparent third-party testing and verify results for mold and mycotoxins.
* Specialty-grade coffee and single-origin beans tend to have better traceability and quality control.

# 9. The Benefits of Single-Origin Coffee

* Single-origin coffee comes from a specific farm or region, offering better traceability and quality control.
* These beans are typically processed with more care, minimizing mold contamination risks.
* Single-origin coffee usually provides better flavor profiles and clarity compared to mass-produced blends.
* Even though high-quality blends may also meet high standards, single-origin beans are generally a safer choice for mold-free coffee.

# 10. Know Your Risk Factors

* People with weakened immune systems, chronic health conditions, or mold allergies should be extra cautious about moldy coffee.
* If you experience symptoms like fatigue, headaches, or digestive discomfort after drinking coffee, consider switching to mold-free options.
* Even healthy individuals can benefit from reducing mycotoxin exposure, as long-term effects can accumulate over time.
* Mold-free coffee may help alleviate chronic symptoms related to mold exposure.

# 11. Top Mold-Free Coffee Brands Worth Trying

* **Purity Coffee**: Rigorously tested for mold, mycotoxins, and other toxins. Known for high antioxidant levels and clean sourcing.
* **Holistic Roasters**: Offers biodynamic, organic coffee tested for over 400 toxins. Provides light, medium, and dark roasts.
* **Fabula Low Acid Coffee**: Focuses on low-acid coffee, ideal for sensitive stomachs, and lab-tested for over 350 chemicals.
* **Lifeboost Coffee**: Tested for 400+ toxins, including mycotoxins and heavy metals. Offers low-acid, high-quality beans for smooth taste.
* **Clean Coffee Co.**: Affordable mold-free coffee with a low-acid profile, perfect for sensitive stomachs.

# Final Thoughts: Making Your Coffee Choice Healthier

Choosing mold-free coffee is an essential step in improving your health and enjoying a safer, cleaner coffee experience. By prioritizing high-quality, certified, and lab-tested beans, you can enjoy your daily cup of coffee without compromising your health. Look for certifications, third-party testing, and specialty-grade beans to ensure the coffee you drink is free from harmful mold and mycotoxins.

Before diving into the nuts and bolts of the accounting cycle, let‚Äôs get clear on what it actually is. The accounting cycle is like a well-organized checklist for financial record-keeping. It‚Äôs a systematic process businesses use to identify, record, and analyze their financial data. Think of it as the backbone of any business's financial management, ensuring everything stays in order, from the smallest coffee receipt to the largest client invoice.

Why does it matter? Because without it, chaos would reign. You‚Äôd lose track of your cash flow, miss tax deadlines, and struggle to gauge your business's financial health. Whether you're a seasoned accountant or a small business owner just getting started, understanding these steps will simplify your financial processes.

# Key Steps in the Accounting Cycle

# Step 1: Identify and Analyze Transactions

The first step is like opening your mailbox. You‚Äôre going through every financial transaction that occurred during the period. This could be a sales invoice, an expense receipt, or even an interest statement from your bank.

* *Why it‚Äôs crucial*: Transactions are the building blocks of the accounting cycle. If you skip or misclassify one, it can ripple through the rest of the process like a domino effect.
* *How to analyze effectively*: Look at the source documents and determine what kind of transaction it is. Is it revenue? An expense? A liability? Accurate categorization here ensures smooth sailing later on.

Take your time to get this right. It might feel tedious, but it‚Äôs like laying a solid foundation for a house‚Äîyou‚Äôll thank yourself later.

# Step 2: Record Transactions in the Journal

Once you've identified your transactions, it‚Äôs time to get them down on paper‚Äîor into your accounting software. This is called journalizing, and it‚Äôs where double-entry bookkeeping comes into play.

* *The basics of journal entries*: Each transaction gets recorded as a debit in one account and a credit in another. For example, buying office supplies for $100 would mean debiting ""Office Supplies"" and crediting ""Cash.""
* *Common pitfalls*: Forgetting to include a small transaction or recording the wrong amount. These errors can snowball and create major headaches later.

Make this step a habit. If you let it pile up, catching up can feel like trying to clean up after a tornado.

# Step 3: Post to the Ledger

The general ledger is where all your journal entries go to live. Think of it as your accounting Bible‚Äîa place where every financial activity gets neatly summarized.

* *Why it matters*: The ledger organizes transactions by account, making it easier to spot trends, errors, or discrepancies.
* *How it works*: When you post to the ledger, you take the entries from your journal and record them under the appropriate account categories (like ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù or ‚ÄúExpenses‚Äù).

This step is all about organization. The cleaner your ledger, the easier everything else will be.

https://preview.redd.it/lqfkbc4rjh7f1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=93e2b37a8803b15793e641ae5ecd3c27616ac48b



# Step 4: Prepare an Unadjusted Trial Balance

Now that your ledger is up to date, it‚Äôs time for a checkpoint. The unadjusted trial balance is essentially a snapshot of your accounts before adjustments. It ensures that your debits and credits match‚Äîif they don‚Äôt, something‚Äôs gone awry.

* *How to create it*: Summarize the balances of all accounts in your ledger. Debits should equal credits, so if they don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll need to go hunting for the error.
* *Why this matters*: This is your last chance to catch major mistakes before moving forward.

Think of this step like proofreading your financial homework. Catching errors here saves you from submitting a flawed report.

# Step 5: Adjust Journal Entries

Adjustments are necessary to account for things like accrued expenses, prepaid expenses, or depreciation. These entries ensure that your financial statements reflect the true financial state of your business.

* *Why adjustments are key*: Without them, you‚Äôd be leaving important financial details out of your records. For example, if you‚Äôve earned interest but haven‚Äôt received it yet, it should still be recorded.
* *How to adjust*: Review the unadjusted trial balance and determine where adjustments are needed. Then create journal entries to reflect these changes.

Adjusting entries might feel like fine-tuning an engine. It‚Äôs not flashy, but it keeps everything running smoothly.

# Step 6: Prepare an Adjusted Trial Balance

Once adjustments are made, it‚Äôs time to prepare another trial balance‚Äîthis one reflecting all the changes. The adjusted trial balance is the launching pad for your financial statements.

* *What it includes*: All account balances, updated with your adjustments.
* *Why it‚Äôs important*: It ensures your financial statements are based on accurate data.

This step is like checking the map before a road trip. You want to make sure you‚Äôre on the right track before moving forward.

# Step 7: Generate Financial Statements

Now we‚Äôre getting to the exciting part‚Äîfinancial statements! This is where all your hard work pays off, as you produce reports like the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

* *Why they matter*: Financial statements are the go-to documents for investors, stakeholders, and even your future self. They tell the story of your business‚Äôs performance.
* *Tips for accuracy*: Double-check that every figure ties back to your adjusted trial balance.

Think of this step as presenting your business's report card. It‚Äôs all about showing off the results of your financial discipline.

# Step 8: Close Temporary Accounts

Temporary accounts, like revenue and expenses, need to be closed out so you can start fresh in the next period. Closing entries transfer these balances to permanent accounts, like retained earnings.

* *How to do it*: Create journal entries to zero out the temporary accounts. For example, if you earned $50,000 in revenue, you‚Äôd debit ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù and credit ‚ÄúRetained Earnings.‚Äù
* *Why it matters*: This step ensures that your books are ready for the next period, with no carryover from previous activity.

Closing accounts is like tidying up your workspace after a long day. It keeps everything neat and ready for what‚Äôs next.

# Step 9: Prepare a Post-Closing Trial Balance

This is the final check to ensure all temporary accounts are closed and your debits still equal your credits. The post-closing trial balance only includes permanent accounts, like assets, liabilities, and equity.

* *Why it‚Äôs necessary:*¬†It confirms that your books are balanced and ready for the new period.
* *How to create it*: Summarize the balances of your permanent accounts from the general ledger.

Think of this as your final review before turning the page to a new chapter in your business‚Äôs financial story.

# Step 10: Start the New Accounting Period

Congratulations, you‚Äôve made it to the finish line‚Äîonly to start again! The accounting cycle is, well, a cycle, meaning it‚Äôs time to begin the process anew.

* *Why this is important*: Starting fresh ensures consistency and accuracy across all periods.
* *How to prepare*: Carry forward balances from your permanent accounts, and get ready to identify and analyze new transactions.

Starting a new cycle is like resetting a clock. It‚Äôs a fresh opportunity to stay on top of your financial game.

# Benefits of RFID in Cycle Counting



RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology is transforming inventory control by offering a faster, more accurate, and less labor-intensive method of conducting cycle counts. Unlike traditional approaches‚Äîsuch as manual counting or barcode scanning‚ÄîRFID enables real-time tracking and bulk item identification without needing a direct line of sight. This results in significant improvements in operational efficiency and stock accuracy.

# Speed and Efficiency

RFID dramatically reduces the time required for cycle counting. A single scan can capture data from hundreds of RFID tags at once, even through packaging or from a distance. This enables warehouse teams to complete counts quickly, allowing for more frequent inventory checks without disrupting daily operations.

# Greater Accuracy

RFID minimizes human error by eliminating manual data entry and the need to scan items individually. With more accurate and consistent data capture, companies experience fewer inventory discrepancies and gain a clearer understanding of their actual stock levels.

# Real-Time Inventory Visibility

RFID systems offer live updates as items move through the warehouse. Every action‚Äîreceiving, picking, relocating‚Äîcan be tracked automatically. This improves visibility across the supply chain and helps businesses make faster, more informed decisions.

# Reduced Labor Costs

Because RFID automates much of the counting process, it reduces the amount of manual labor required. Employees spend less time on repetitive tasks and can focus on higher-value activities such as customer service, process improvement, or order processing.

# Loss Prevention and Traceability

RFID enhances warehouse security by allowing continuous tracking of items. If something goes missing or is misplaced, RFID can help quickly trace its last known location. This reduces shrinkage and improves accountability.

# Scalability and Integration

RFID solutions are highly scalable and can be integrated with existing Warehouse Management Systems (WMS), ERP platforms, and IoT technologies. Whether managing a small warehouse or a large multi-site operation, RFID can grow with your business needs.

1ldmj7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/SomaticExperiencing/comments/1ldmj7o/frictionlessminimum_viable_daily_checkin/,Frictionless/Minimum viable Daily check-in framework for trauma recovery and nailing freeze by the body/nervous system signals throughout the day,"Hi fellow somatic experiencers !

I have cPTSD, due a childhood of domestic violence (physical and psychological) with a narcissist dad and a mom completely victim of him.

I‚Äôm sharing here lessons of a 2 years healing journey. I started somatic experiencing 1.5 years ago, and had read Bessel Van Der Kolk 2.5 year ago (took me a year to finally take to somatic experiencing).

I‚Äôm happy to discuss deeper some elements in DM/Zoom meetings, feel free to get in touch i‚Äôm deeply passionate by the topic of trauma, since it changed my life to realize I was full of trauma & heal from it.

Today I want to share with you how I finally landed on a daily check-in framework that worked sustainably for me, and helped me nailed freeze from the very morning, in order to then adjust my day accordingly.

One of the sad thing of freeze is when we always do back and forth between freeze and safety, we end not really knowing in which state we are and hence shall we continue our day normally or adjust the pace/calm down/regulate.

I iterated over so many approaches to do daily check-in that helps, and finally, leveraging acronyms, I found the most frictionless method possible : 1 check per day, in the morning, to check-in 30+ parameters.

The parameters are related to 2 specific moments of the day :

* period1 : the previous day entirely, except the morning routine
* period2 : the morning routine I just experienced during my post-wake-up walk in nature

  
So basically I fill the check-in slates (see photos at the end) just 1x/day, after my walk in the mountains, to assess both period1 (the day before) and period2 (the morning routine I just went through)

Here is the list of acronyms & their signification:

**Morning routine :**

* **BRSm** This stands for Body Relaxation Sequence Morning, and it indicates if I executed the BRS and I felt great after it. I do this sequence just after getting out of bed, it‚Äôs gentle somatic moves to breath fine and unlock the body
* **IZI MO** This indicates if climbing up to the mountains (it‚Äôs a gentle 20min walk, nothing super hard) was easy or not. Usually it will ‚Äúfeel‚Äù hard if there is a certain degree of freeze in my system, and the associated ruminations
* **COF TAS** This stands for ‚ÄúCOFFEE TASTE‚Äù, This is specific for people like me who have toxic shame and try to have a strict diet to keep a fit body : if the coffee tastes weird, it usually means i‚Äôm in a kcal deficit that‚Äôs too extreme, and that I may be aware of this and not be confused between actual freeze and an anxiety response that‚Äôs due to the body not having enough food to function. Took me so long to find this super helpful parameter!
* **E.Cont** This stands for Eye Contact. It helps me check-in > Do I eye contact with people when doing the round-trip 50min walk to the mountains ? If not, it means my toxic shame is kicking, hence I‚Äôm certainly frozen to a certain degree
* **POS OUT** This stands for POSITIVE OUTLOOK, it helps me track ‚Äúdo I have positive outlooks in my mind after doing my morning routine in the moutains ?‚Äù
* **S1MO** This stands for I‚Äôm not gonna detail what, but basically helps me assess my bowel movements after the morning routine
* **RT HTF** This stands for ‚ÄúRegulation Technique Hit The Fear‚Äù, helps me assess how the regulation technique allowed me to come back in my body aka come back in safety. Hence the term ‚Äúhit the fear‚Äù aka I managed to release fear and hence feel safe again
* **SBBI** This stands for Slow Big Belly Inhale, indicates if after the morning routine I have this big inflating belly for each inhale. Usually signals great state of safety
* **UDK-** This stands for Ultra Deficit Kcal > indicates if I‚Äôm really craving too much food already in the morning, usually signals I need to eat something instead of struggling my whole morning (I do intermittent fasting)
* **TSMO** This stands for ‚ÄúThinking Sequence Mountains‚Äù, indicates if I had a lot of thinking sequences (think racing thoughts) after finishing my morning routine.
* **A.LBO PO MO** This stands for ‚ÄúAuto Long Breath Out Post Mountains‚Äù. I realize when I‚Äôm in safety, the most obvious visible parameter is that my nervous system takes care of regulating emotions in the background by making me do long natural exhales. I track here that I‚Äôm in this state or not, aka do I see myself doing these great exhales ?
* **RP MO** This stands for ‚ÄúRegulated Pre Mountains‚Äù, it indicates if, before even going out for my morning routine in the mountains, I felt already very regulated or not. Usually i‚Äôm not lol hence the walking trip to the mountains :)
* **IC** Indicates if I feel connected to my inner self (Inner Connection)
* **MW PO MO** This indicates how is my mindwandering, with a score being 0, 1 or 2. See this post for more information about how I assess my mindwandering (my thoughts basically) > [https://www.reddit.com/r/SomaticExperiencing/comments/1l6glov/insights\_lifehacks\_from\_someone\_who\_obsessed\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SomaticExperiencing/comments/1l6glov/insights_lifehacks_from_someone_who_obsessed_over/)
* **DREAM** Do I remember my dreams of this night ?
* **NIGHT** How the night was ? I have a scoring system for my nights, I will not detail it here but happy to share it in comments if someone is interested
* **SBBN** Sleep Broken By Noise : was my sleep interrupted by noise ? I live in a muslim country, very often the prayers calls early in the morning and will wake me up (furious to be interrupted in my sleep!! üôÇ)

**Previous day :**

* **CI OG** This indicates if the previous day I took time to do some Check-In On the Go
* **RG OG** This indicates if the previous day I took time to do some nervous system regulation On the Go, when I felt I needed to
* **JO FOOD** This indicates if I felt like I wanted to Jump On Food (JO FOOD) at the end of dinner. This usually indicates I didint have enough food during the dinner and I went to bed craving food > not good!
* **PDS NTAF** this indicates Post Dinner Not Thinking About Food > simply indicates did I have thoughts around found when I went walking after my dinner ? If yes, usually signals I tried to ignore my body telling me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry!‚Äù
* **FRPS** this indicates ‚ÄúFully Regulated Pre Sleep‚Äù, signals if I felt completely regulated before going to bed, trackable via how I was breathing, was I stressed around a topic ?
* **GYM** did I weight lift the day before ?
* **OXY R** did I see people the day before (OXYTOCIN REAL)
* **OXY O** did I see people ONLINE the day before (OXYTOCIN ONLINE)
* **DK** How was my kcal deficit the day before overal ? (DK for Deficit Kcal)
* **FOOD CHA** Did I change the food I ate the day before ? Because usually I always eat the same exact food, but sometimes I need to change to feel good.
* **RT OK** Regulation Technique OK ? Indicates if my regulation techniques worked or not. When they didn‚Äôt, mostly it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt have enough food in my body hence no regulation technique can really work : I have to eat! üôÇ
* **DANCE/SING** Indicates if yes or not, I danced or sing to some music the previous day
* **WHA** For WHATSAPP, indicates how badly I craved notification from messaging apps (can be reddit, whatsapp, emails, slack and so on)
* **COLD APP** Did I cold approach any women the day before ? Yes I sometimes do that but lately didnt do it much as you will see on the images üôÇ
* **NAP** Did I NAP the day before ? I also mark how I felt after, usually very bad because napping makes me freeze badly üòü
* **IZI PREP FOOD** Was is easy to prepare dinner ? If not, mostly because I‚Äôm frozen
* **MTBO** Did I have a working metabolism during dinner ? If difficult to ingest the food > 1 million percent I‚Äôm frozen. This happened so many times before without me noticing lol what a drag. Now I spot the issue instantly cause it‚Äôs in my conscious brain
* **FOOD TASTE** How did the food taste ? I didn‚Äôt taste much, same, 1 million percent I‚Äôm frozen. Eating the same exact food everyday allowed me to realize how the taste experience chances completely when you are in safety as opposed as freeze. Confirmed by Stephen Porges in an interview.

And here are the check-in school slate as of last week (I upload them weekly to my google drive) :

In my 20‚Äôs I was a complete mess, drinking and eating everything in sight. One morning when I was 28 I woke up with the worst hangover and decided that was enough. 

I was around 300lbs in the first picture, my first steps on this journey was cutting all the calories from what I drink. So for the longest time all I drank was water and black coffee, slowly adding sugar free pop. Then I started walking every single day and like 10-20lbs just fell off. So I was feeling better about myself and joined my local gym. All throughout my 30‚Äôs I added intermittent fasting, cutting out most most junk food and consistent strength training/cardio and challenges like 75 hard to keep it interesting. 

Now I‚Äôve been entered my 40‚Äôs and it‚Äôs getting more difficult to do the things that got me here so I feel like I have to relearn how to be fit.

My goal is always Fontana Dam to the Big Creek Ranger station, where my car is waiting for me.  I take 10 days on the trail to do, so it is never too grueling and some days are just a 4 hour stroll and the spend the rest of the day in the shelter watching the rain come down and sipping coffee. This year I had to cancel because the Rangers had to close FOUR of the shelters along the AT. Many years I've had to work around one or two closings, but FOUR? Never. 

The Ranger I talked to said it was because too many people are not using the bear cables to hang their food, but rather are keeping it in the shelter with them. They also said that the AT thru hikers are especially careless with their food and that by the time the thru hiker bubble is over, the bears have learned where to find easy people food. So the AT thru hikers are gone, but the problem they created persists behind them. 

All this to say USE THE BEAR CABLES!!!! PLEASE! Bears that learn to find and enjoy people food are very soon going to be dead bears. No, not because the food kills them, but because once a bear attacks a human that bear will likely have to killed by Rangers.  So you're not just inconveniencing poor old retired guys like me who like to hike once a year along the AT in the park, but you're putting the lives of the bears in great danger with your carelessness. 

Man, I hope at least one person reads this and decides to hang their food. ",25,1750165219.0,GSMNP,6,1.0,False

Think of it like a modern perks card: employers subscribe on behalf of their staff, and employees get access to perks like free coffees, ¬£5 off lunch, exclusive discounts, and even competitions or rewards ‚Äî all from independent businesses in their area.

We‚Äôre also building in cool features like:

Points for volunteering locally

A place to discover trusted tradespeople with perks attached

A way for employers to ‚ÄúTreat the Team‚Äù with meals or drinks from local spots

And a bunch of ideas to support community connection, not just consumption


We‚Äôre about to launch a local trial in the North East of England and would love to hear what people think of the idea in general ‚Äî would you use something like this at your workplace? Would you want your local caf√© or gym on board?

Any feedback or ideas really appreciated üôè

Thanks

1ldmekw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ldmekw/my_ecofriendly_life_is_built_on_a_lie_and_my/,"My ""Eco-Friendly"" Life is Built on a Lie, and My Compost Bin is a Monument to My Shame","I'm 32, and for the past two years, I've cultivated this image of being incredibly environmentally conscious. Think reusable everything, minimalist wardrobe, and a deep, abiding love for my compost bin. My friends praise me, my family makes jokes about my ""granola"" lifestyle, and I even got a date once because I mentioned how much I loved reducing my carbon footprint.

The truth? I hate composting. With a passion.

It all started innocently enough. I was trying to impress a girl who was super into sustainability. She mentioned how much she loved her compost bin, and I, in a moment of utter idiocy, chimed in, ""Oh, me too! Can't live without mine!"" The problem was, at that point, my ""compost bin"" was just a forgotten bucket of kitchen scraps in my backyard that smelled faintly of despair.

But the lie took root. She was impressed. We went on a few dates. And suddenly, I had to *actually* get a compost bin. I bought a fancy, rotating one, watched a dozen YouTube tutorials, and started dutifully tossing in my fruit peels and coffee grounds.

The reality of it, though, is a nightmare. It's messy. It smells. Fruit flies are my constant companions. I live in a fairly small garden, and the sight of my expensive, constantly-churning rot-machine fills me with dread. Every time I open it, I brace myself for the stench and the inevitable swarm of tiny, winged demons.

My friends come over, and they admire my ""commitment."" My fianc√©e (yes, the girl I was trying to impress is now my fianc√©e, adding another layer to this elaborate charade) even bought me a worm farm for my birthday last year, thinking it would be ""the perfect addition"" to my eco-friendly setup. I've tried to bond with those worms, I really have, but all I feel is a creeping sense of dread. I spend half my time wondering if they're happy, and the other half trying to ignore the fact that my kitchen is now home to thousands of tiny, wriggling creatures.

I'm trapped. I can't back out now. My entire identity to my social circle is ""the eco-friendly one with the amazing compost."" If I suddenly abandoned it, the questions would be endless. The disappointment palpable. How do you tell everyone you've been living a lie about something as mundane as decomposing food scraps?

So here I am, secretly dreaming of a life free of food waste segregation and wriggling worm farms, all while outwardly championing the joys of organic decomposition. Send help (and maybe a really good air freshener).",3,1750164954.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False
1ldmdnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ldmdnl/the_voice_in_the_wood/,The Voice In The Wood,"We live tucked deep in the Southern Appalachian mountains, in a holler no GPS will find and no outsider wants to stumble into after dark. The kind of place where the woods don't end-they swallow. There's a hush to the land out here. The kind of quiet that doesn't feel empty, just watchful.

It was just past midnight when it happened. A Thursday, I think. The air was still, heavy with the scent of moss and pine, the kind of thick silence that settles over everything once the cicadas burn out. The kids were asleep. My wife had gone to bed an hour earlier, and I stayed behind in the kitchen, sipping bad coffee and scrolling through nothing.

Then I heard her call my name-sharp, afraid.

I moved fast. That's not how she calls unless something's wrong. I bolted down the hall toward our bedroom-only to find it empty. The covers pulled back, the lamp still on. My stomach dropped.

Out the window, I spotted her-sitting in our old Jeep, parked just beyond the porch light's reach. The moon was bright enough to cast everything in silver, and I could see her clearly, wide-eyed, staring out across the yard toward the woods.

That's when John ran.

He came tearing down the gravel drive barefoot, shirtless, wild-eyed. He didn't even look at me. Just hit the treeline and vanished into the dark like something was chasing him, or like he was running straight into hell to avoid it.

Then I heard it.

""Hello?""

A child's voice. Small. Lost. A little girl-no older than six. It floated out from the black edge of the woods, just beyond the first row of trees.

There was something about it-the way it held my name without saying it. The way it cracked just a little at the end, like she was trying not to cry.

I called back, ""Hey! Who's out there?""

The voice answered, same tone. Same softness.
""Hello?""

It wasn't just an answer. It was an echo-but not mine. It didn't sound like something trying to be a kid. It sounded like something pretending. And doing it too well.

My wife hadn't moved. Still frozen in the car, but now she was staring at me. I saw it in her face-the shift. From fear to real fear. Whatever was in those woods, she felt it too.

I motioned her toward the house, and she moved fast. She left the car door open as she sprinted. The moment she passed me, I turned to follow.

That's when it called again.

""Hello?""

Closer now. Same voice. Too close.

Every inch of my body tightened. My skin knew before my brain did: this wasn't some lost child. This was a trap. Something trying to get close enough for something worse.

I broke into a sprint. Feet hitting the porch hard, the wood creaking under me. I slammed the front door shut and threw the deadbolt. My wife collapsed against the hallway wall, breathing fast. I didn't ask questions-I didn't need to.

We both knew.

Silence. Then-

Scratch.
Low. Deliberate. A slow drag of nails-not fingertips-across the wood just beneath the handle.

Then the voice again. Just on the other side.

""Hello?""

The scratching stopped.

No footsteps. No rustling. Just that brutal silence the mountains keep like a secret. You could've heard a mouse shift in the walls-or your own heartbeat cracking in your ears.

We stood still. My wife slid down the wall and curled her knees to her chest. I placed one hand on the doorframe like I was holding it closed with more than just the lock. Truth was, I didn't trust the bolt. Not with that voice out there.

Out here in the deep woods, you learn to respect what doesn't make sense.

I checked the time. 1:03 a.m. That meant we had hours before dawn. Hours of shadow. Of not knowing. Of that thing waiting out there. Or worse-circling.

""Should we call someone?"" she whispered.

Call who? The county sheriff lives forty minutes away. Cell signal's a rumor this deep in the holler. Even if we got a bar, what do I say?
""Something's scratching my door and pretending to be a lost little girl""?

She knew the answer already. She didn't ask again.

I walked to the back window and peered through the blinds. The treeline lay still. The moon lit up the yard like frost, but past the first dozen trees, it was all ink. That kind of dark where your eyes never adjust. Like the woods weren't empty-just full of something that knew how to hold still.

And that voice...

It wasn't gone. Not really. I could feel it, just past the light. Like someone watching you from a place they've already memorized.

That's the thing about these mountains: they know how to listen. They soak up sound. They let your screams die in the hollows and come back to you as whispers. They don't care if you're scared.

I pulled the shotgun from above the fireplace. It was loaded. It wouldn't help.

""Maybe it's gone,"" my wife said. But she didn't believe it. Her voice was just one more thing to keep the quiet from swallowing us.

I don't know what time I fell asleep, but I remember the last thing I heard before I did.

A soft tap. Not a knock. Just a test. Like a finger running along glass.

From the kitchen window this time.

Then-

""Hello?""
They say the mountains have rules.

Old ones. Not written down, not spoken often. Just known. If you grow up in these woods-or stay long enough-you learn to keep your porch light on, your curtains closed, and your door locked tight after sunset. You don't whistle at night. You don't call back when something calls your name. And above all, you don't open the door.

We didn't open the door.

But that thing didn't leave.

The next few hours blurred into a long, breathless stretch of waiting. The tapping moved-sometimes on the front door, sometimes the windows. Sometimes it circled the house in long, dragging loops. I'd hear it at the kitchen glass...then five seconds later, at the back porch...then, nothing.

Then-

""Hello?""

My wife clutched my hand tight whenever it came close. She didn't ask what it was. She knew. It wasn't a child. It wasn't lost. It was inviting itself in.

At 2:27 a.m., it found the kids' window.

The first tap was light-like a moth against the glass. Then another. Then three in a row. Rhythmic.

My daughter's voice floated down the hall. ""Daddy?""

I was already moving.

I slipped into the room. She and her younger brother sat up in bed, their eyes wide but calm. They didn't cry. Didn't scream. Mountain kids. They'd been raised to respect the dark.

""There's someone at the window,"" she said. ""She keeps saying hello.""

I looked. The curtains were drawn. But I felt it. Right there, on the other side.

I motioned them out of the room silently, guiding them to the couch in the living room where my wife had pulled blankets and cushions into a quiet nest.

We didn't speak. Not because we were afraid to-but because it was listening.

For the next hour, it danced around the house. The voice would disappear, and in its place-silence so loud you could feel it vibrating inside your chest. The kind of quiet that doesn't bring peace. The kind that tells you something's thinking.

Then, around 4:00 a.m., it changed.

No more tapping.

No more ""Hello?""

Just a thump. A weight. Something leaning against the front door.

Then-

""Joe.""

The voice didn't belong to a child anymore.

It was John.

""Joe-man, it's me. Please. I didn't know where else to go.""
His voice cracked like a branch splitting under pressure. ""Please open the door.""

My hands went numb.

He said my name again. And again. Always with the same rhythm. Same crack. Same tone.

""Please. Please open the door.""

I stared at the deadbolt.

My wife sat upright, her hand trembling now. She shook her head, just once. Hard.

""Joe-I think it broke my leg,"" the voice said next. ""I think it's out there somewhere. Please.""

But he didn't knock.

And he didn't move.

And that's how I knew.

Whatever was out there, whatever had chased John into those woods-it didn't need to find him. It had learned him. Learned his panic, his words, his voice, his fear.

Now it was wearing him.

The kids stared at me, silent. Their faces pale in the candlelight. The tapping had stopped completely.

The voice spoke again.

""Joe?""

It said my name in the same tone the girl had used.

The exact same tone.
Around 4:45 a.m., the woods changed.

Not the way city folks mean when they talk about sunrise-no birdsong, no golden sky. In these mountains, dawn doesn't arrive. It climbs. It crawls its way up the ridges and slips through the trees like a ghost. And until it crests the ridge behind our house, it's still night.

The voice hadn't spoken in half an hour.

That silence was the worst part.

We all sat in the living room, blankets wrapped tight, the kids drowsy but too afraid to sleep. My wife had one hand on my son's shoulder, her eyes on the door. I hadn't moved in twenty minutes. Didn't breathe right. Couldn't.

It was waiting.

That much I knew in my bones. Not gone. Not walking away. Just waiting for the right shape to wear. The right voice. The final thread.

Then came the whisper.

Not at the window. Not the door. It came from inside.

From the hallway.

Soft. Measured.

""...Daddy?""

My heart stopped.

It wasn't my daughter.

It sounded like her. But she was asleep, her head in my wife's lap. I looked down at her-heard the shallow, panicked breath of a child pretending not to be awake.

Another whisper. From deeper down the hall, just around the corner.
""Daddy... can you help me?""

I stood slowly. My wife shook her head again, her grip tightening on the kids.

""I'm stuck,"" the voice said. Higher now. Fragile. ""I can't get out.""

I stepped toward the hall. My boots silent on the old pine floor.

""I'm scared.""

Three words. Just three. But they came too smooth. Too rehearsed. Like someone trying not to get the words wrong.

I crept down the hallway, hand tight on the shotgun. I passed the kids' bedroom door. The sound came again.

""Daddy?""

From the basement door.

That door was always shut. Locked from the inside.

I stood there, breathing slow. My father's words echoed from a time I hadn't thought of in years.
""Don't ever open a door just because something on the other side knows your name.""

I didn't.

Instead, I dropped to my knees and pressed one ear to the wood.

It went quiet.

Then something scraped, slow and low, just beyond the frame.

Like fingernails on stone.

Then the voice spoke one more time.

""Help me daddy im stuck""
Pleading so close to my daughters voice. But not quite just enough off to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. 

I stood and backed away. Never turned my back on that door.

---

At 6:13 a.m., the first light broke the treetops.

The tapping never returned.

But the woods never went back to normal either.

`18-Nov-2011`: Updated to include the [latest markdown changes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/mg1j6/reddit_change_new_markdown_interpreter/)

####Contents

>1. Basic text formatting (*Italics*, **Bold**, ~~Strikethrough~~, Super^script, `inline code`, Quoting)
2. Linking
3. Line Breaks & Paragraphs
4. Lists
5. Tables
6. Block Code
7. Headlines and Horizontals

####1\. Basic Text Formatting


> **Italics** are created using either a single asterisk (\*) or single underscore (\_).

>Example:

>>This is \*italic text\*, this is also \_italic text\_.

>becomes:

>>This is *italic text*, this is also _italic text_.

#

>**Bold text** is created with double asterisks (\*\*) or double underscores (\_\_).

>Example:

>>This is \*\*bold text\*\*, this is also \_\_bold text\_\_.

>becomes:

>>This is **bold text**, this is also __bold text__.

#

>**Strikethrough text** is created using a double tilde (`~~`).

>Example:

>>This is `~~`strikethrough text`~~`.

>becomes:

>>This is ~~strikethrough~~ text.

#

>**Superscript text** is created using the carot (`^`). 

>Example:

>> This sentence contains super`^`script.

>becomes:

>> This sentence contains super^script.    
    
>Note that you cannot leave space before the carot, and there is no *closing tag*.     

>>Superscript can also be stacked^like^this.

#

>**inline code** (monospaced text) is created using the backtick ([grave accents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent)) (\`).

>Example:

>> This sentence contains inline code: `` ` ``javascript:alert(""hello world"");`` ` ``

>becomes:

>> This sentence contains inline code: `javascript:alert(""hello world"");`

#

>**Quoting** is achieved by starting a line with an Angle Bracket (>)

>Example:

>>\>Here's a quote.

>>\>Another paragraph in the same quote.    
>>\>\>A nested quote.    

>>\>Back to a single quote.

>>And finally some unquoted text.

>becomes:

>>>Here's a quote.
    
>>>Another paragraph in the same quote.
>>>>A nested quote.    

>>>Back to a single quote.

>>And finally some unquoted text.

#

>To **remove formatting** you will need to use a Backslash (\\)

>Example:

>>This sentence escapes \\\*italic text\\\* and \\\*\\\*bold text\\\*\\\*.

>becomes:

>>This sentence escapes \*italic text\* and \*\*bold text\*\*. 

####2\. Linking

>**Creating a link**

>Example:

>> \[Reddit\]\(`http://reddit.com`\)

>becomes:

>> [Reddit](http://reddit.com)   

>You cannot begin a link with ""www"", it must begin with one of the following URL schemes:

>>* http://
* https://
* ftp://
* mailto:
* steam://
* irc://
* news://
* mumble://
* ssh:// 
    
#

>You can also provide **title text** for links:

>> \[Reddit\]\(`http://reddit.com` ""what's new online!""\).

>becomes:

>> [Reddit](http://reddit.com ""what's new online!"") ‚Üê (*hover*!)    
    
>Title text can be used to hide **spoilers**:

>> `[spoiler](/s""The spoiler text goes here"")`

>becomes:

>> [spoiler](/s""The spoiler text goes here"") ‚Üê (*hover*!)

#

>Reddit now recognises when you want to **link to a subreddit**.

>Example:

>>This is a shameless plug for \/r/BritishTV!

>becomes:

>>This is a shameless plug for /r/BritishTV!

#

>If a URL contains brackets you will need to escape these.

>Example without escaping:

>>`[Cube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(film))`

>becomes:

>>[Cube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(film)) ‚Üê (*note the surplus bracket*!)    
    
>Example with escaping:

>>`[Cube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(film\))`

>becomes:

>>[Cube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(film\)) ‚Üê (*no surplus bracket*!)    
    
####3\. Line Breaks & Paragraphs

>**Line breaks** in comments are achieved by adding four spaces (*shown using* ‚ñë) to the end of the line. Simply hitting return (*shown using* ‚Üµ) will not work.

>Example:

>>First line‚Üµ    
>>Second line

>becomes:

>>First line Second line

>but:

>>First line‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚Üµ    
>>Second line

>becomes:

>>First line    
>>Second line

#

>**Paragraphs** are formed when you hit return (*shown using* ‚Üµ) twice.

>>First Paragraph‚Üµ    
>>‚Üµ    
>>Second Paragraph

>becomes:

>>First Paragraph

>>Second Paragraph

####4\. Lists

>To create **Unordered Lists** each item should begin with either an asterisk (\*), plus sign (\+) or minus sign (\-).

>Example:

>>\* Item 1    
>>\+ Item 2    
>>\- Item 3     

>becomes:

>>* Item 1
>>+ Item 2
>>- Item 3

#

>**Ordered Lists** are created with a number and period. It doesn't matter which number you start with, as markdown will always start with 1.

>Example:

>>3\. Item 1    
>>2\. Item 2    
>>1\. Item 3

>becomes:

>>3. Item 1
>>2. Item 2
>>1. Item 3

#

>The markup for **Nested Lists** has changed slightly:

>Example:

>>1\. This is Item 1    
>>2\.    
>>‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë1\. This is Item 2.1    
>>‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë2\. This is Item 2.2    
>>3\. This is Item 3    
>>4\. This is Item 4

>becomes:

>>1. This is Item 1
>>2. 
>>    1. This is Item 2.1
>>    2. This is Item 2.2
>>3. This is Item 3
>>4. This is Item 4

#

>Lists should be clear of any text in the line immediately above and below, the same as making a new paragraph:

>>This is the **wrong way to make a list**    
>>1. lorem    
>>2. ispum    
>>reddit doesn't realize it should listify...    

>becomes:

>>This is the **wrong way to make a list**
>>1. lorem
>>2. ispum
>>reddit doesn't realize it should listify...    

>Place lists in their own paragraph: 

>>This is the **correct way to make a list**    

>>1. lorem    
>>2. ispum    

>>reddit realizes it should listify!  

>**Paragraphs in Lists** and **Nested lists using a combination of ordered and unordered lists**, are no longer supported.

####5\. Tables

>**Tables** are created using pipes (|):

>Example

>>
[](ftp://grrr.net)Left align | Center align | Right align     
[](ftp://grrr.net):--|:--:|--:    
This | This | This     
column | column | column     
will | will | will     
be | be |  be     
left |  center | right     
aligned | aligned   | aligned     

>becomes:

>>
 Left align | Center align | Right align 
:--|:--:|--:
 This       |     This     |        This 
 column     |    column    |      column 
 will       |     will     |        will 
 be         |      be      |          be 
 left       |    center    |       right 
 aligned    |    aligned   |     aligned 

>Note that by default the first row is always **bolded**.

>**Column Alignment** is determined by the second row.

>>Use ""**:--:**"" for centre aligned text, ""**--:**"" for right, and ""**:--**"" for left.

> You can also leave the top row empty, as long as you have the correct amount of pipes:

>>
[](ftp://grr.net)||    
[](ftp://grrr.net):--|:--:|--:    
the|top|row    
is|now|empty    

>becomes

>>
  |  |  
:--|:--:|--:
the|top|row
is|now|empty

####6\. Block code

>Displaying **block code**, without formatting and in monospaced font, is as simple as starting the line with four spaces (*shown using* ‚ñë).

>Example:

>>‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñëline of code    
>>‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñëline of code    
>>‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñëline of code   
>>‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñëline of code   
>>‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñëline of code  

>becomes:

>>` line of code`    
>>` line of code`    
>>` line of code`    
>>` line of code`    
>>` line of code`    

####7\. Headlines & Horizonal Rules

>**Headline text** can be created by using a number of hashes (#) corresponding to the tag you want. Headline tags will format all text until it encounters a Line Break or new Paragraph.

>>\# Headline 1    
>>\#\# Headline 2    
>>\#\#\# Headline 3

>becomes:

>>#Headline 1    
>>##Headline 2    
>>###Headline 3

>`NOTE`: Markdown supports up to six headline tags, but only the first three have default formatting.

#

>To create a **Horizontal Rule**, simply add three asterisks (\*) to an empty line.

>>\*\*\*

>becomes:

>>***

Our mom was a deeply flawed woman ‚Äî controlling, manipulative, religious to the point of cruelty. My brother took the brunt of it. When he was 20, he snapped. He beat her so badly she spent six months on life support. She never regained consciousness. He got 18 years for attempted murder.

She died two years after the attack. I was the one who planned the funeral. I was 23, broke, alone. I buried her in an unmarked grave at her request ‚Äî and I told no one where.

Over the years, my brother wrote me letters from prison. At first he was angry, saying I betrayed him for ‚Äúchoosing her.‚Äù Later, the tone changed. By the time he got out five years ago, he was... quiet. Apologetic. Tried to make amends. I didn‚Äôt respond. I moved. Changed numbers. I‚Äôve been happy, finally.

Now he‚Äôs dying and wants closure. He wants to say goodbye. To her.

I visited him yesterday. He was skeletal and shaking. He begged. Said he‚Äôs not the same person. Said he just wants to make peace. I said:

>

He cried. I didn‚Äôt. I went and got coffee after, then went home to my wife and daughter. I didn‚Äôt feel good about it, but I felt... resolved.

Now my cousin is texting me, saying I‚Äôm cruel. That people deserve forgiveness on their deathbed. That I should give him this.

But I don‚Äôt think he gets it. He wants to visit a grave, but he already put her in it.

1ldm5i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ldm5i9/i_am_going_crazy_in_my_marriage/,I am going crazy in my marriage.,"This is a long post, and I have asked ChatGPT to write it chronologically; I would appreciate if anyone, men or women, have been through something similar and if they‚Äôre happy with their lives now.

I (29F) have been married to my 30(M) husband for four years. We have a 2-year-old son together.

We‚Äôre from the same country and culture, but I had immigrated to Canada eight years before meeting him. When we met back home, our relationship felt much better than it does now. We rushed into marriage, and after that, I applied for his permanent residency and brought him to Canada.

Shortly after he moved, he convinced me to sell my fully paid-off 2013 Cadillac SRX‚Äîa car I had bought myself‚Äîand to finance a 2016 BMW X5. He said he would be the one paying for it, that it was the smarter choice. But once we got married, he took out a loan himself, and suddenly the BMW payments fell entirely on me. It‚Äôs been over three years now, and I‚Äôve been paying for the car, even during my maternity leave when I was earning less than $2,000 a month.

On top of that, I paid for almost all the groceries, I do all the cooking, all the cleaning, and take full responsibility for our son. My husband does absolutely nothing at home after work. I work full-time from home in the oil and gas industry while also caring for our toddler, which has been mentally and physically exhausting. Yes, my husband‚Äôs job in cribbing is physically demanding‚Äîbut I am tired too.

Soon after our marriage, I started noticing his wandering eye. Every time I confronted him, he‚Äôd gaslight me‚Äîmake me feel like I was paranoid or imagining things. He even complained to my father about me. My father, who was abusive to my mother and to us growing up, was the last person he should have involved, especially knowing our family history. Of course, this created more conflict between my parents.

Last year, he asked to use my TikTok account (I never really used it myself), and I didn‚Äôt think twice. That‚Äôs when I discovered the ‚Äúviewed‚Äù section, and saw how many women he had been watching. It shattered my heart. But I didn‚Äôt even bring it up‚Äîbecause I knew it wouldn‚Äôt change anything. It would only lead to another argument, more emotional manipulation, and me crying.

Over the past 3.5 years, I‚Äôve cried more than I ever thought possible. I cried before, during, and after my pregnancy. He knew I had nowhere to go after cutting ties with my father due to his abuse. I had made sacrifices for him, and he used that against me.

When he first came to Canada, he sent a large amount of money to his family. I supported it at first and even helped. But it quickly got out of hand‚Äîso much so that he had to take out a loan to pay for our wedding. That money could‚Äôve covered most of our expenses if he hadn‚Äôt sent so much back home.

Now, I no longer cry. I‚Äôve become stoic. But his presence still deeply bothers me. I can feel how much he dislikes me. Everything I say‚Äîor don‚Äôt say‚Äîbecomes an issue. Everything I do‚Äîor don‚Äôt do‚Äîis wrong in his eyes. He says cruel things, and he used to make me cry with his words, until I just‚Ä¶ stopped caring. I no longer love him. I don‚Äôt like using the word ‚Äúhate,‚Äù especially since he‚Äôs the father of my child‚Äîbut being around him makes me feel miserable. My stomach physically hurts from the tension. He stopped showing affection long ago. The only time he touches me is when he wants sex, and even that has become something I dread. I don‚Äôt want him to touch me at all anymore.

And it breaks me, because I loved him with my whole heart. I did everything for him. I made sure his PR was approved in record time‚Äîjust three months. I cooked, cleaned, cared for him, made sure he had his epilepsy medication, and tried to build a loving home. He never had to lift a finger. And still, a few months ago, he said, ‚ÄúCan you go bring me a glass of water, my maid?‚Äù Who says that to their wife?

He belittled me constantly. Even something as simple as going out for coffee‚Äîwhich used to be my therapy‚Äîhe‚Äôd make me feel guilty for. Meanwhile, his mother and sisters go out every day, get their nails, hair, and lashes done, and take yearly vacations. I haven‚Äôt been on a real vacation since May 2024, when I went to visit his family.

I now feel like if he does nothing at home, he should at least cover all the financial responsibilities. I want him to take over the BMW payments, but convincing him is nearly impossible.

He stonewalls me‚Äîsometimes for hours, sometimes for days‚Äîjust because I said or did something that upset him. He lies, manipulates, and makes me feel like I‚Äôm useless, like I owe him everything. He‚Äôs always been considered handsome, and I guess I‚Äôm seen as average. But after maternity leave, when I started going back to the office, there were men who would show interest in me. There were men who would ask me out or hit on me when I would go out for walks at lunch time. I never once entertained it. I would never cheat. 

And yet, my husband never saw my worth. 
Heck, he can‚Äôt even be bothered to change our son‚Äôs diaper‚Äîhe‚Äôs maybe done it three times, ever. I can‚Äôt even leave my son with him for a few hours without coming back to silence or passive-aggressive treatment.

Last year, the BMW had issues, and I paid for all repairs out of pocket. It‚Äôs been hard to save money. Every time we visit his family, I pay for my ticket, my son‚Äôs ticket, my own spending money, gifts for his family‚Äîeverything. The last time we went, I was supposed to travel alone with my son. At the last minute, he decided to come too‚Äîbut booked a different flight to save $400. That money, he said, was better spent taking his family out to dinner. I traveled 18 hours with a baby by myself. That‚Äôs when I decided: next time he wants to go back home, if he doesn‚Äôt pay for all our tickets, I‚Äôm not going.

So why haven‚Äôt I left?
I have always judged women who would be in such marriages, and wouldn‚Äôt leave:

The reason why I haven‚Äôt is because I feel stuck. I‚Äôm trying to pay off my credit cards. But more than that, there‚Äôs the cultural pressure. My mom is currently going through a divorce at 52. It‚Äôs been so hard on her because of the shame in our culture. If I divorce my husband, it will break her heart‚Äîand I know everyone would talk. Not that I would care, but my mom would. And she has been through SO MUCH‚Ä¶ 

Still, deep inside, I know I will end this marriage. I don‚Äôt want my son to grow up the same way as I did, witnessing so much turmoil between his parents. Every time my husband starts an argument in front of our son, I end it right there. If he continues, I take my son and go to the bedroom, shut the door, so that our son isn‚Äôt exposed to this BS. I know it will be difficult for my son to grow up in a broken home; but as someone who wished her parents would divorce since I was a child, due to their volatile marriage, I know this will be the right decision for my son. 

It hurts so much knowing how much I wanted a big family. I wanted my son to have siblings. I wanted to buy a house. That dream is long gone.

He will roll over in bed mumble it‚Äôs early then go back to sleep. The times where I have asked for help or to do a rotation of who watches her upon the early wake up has led to fights every time.

1ldm4mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1ldm4mx/strange_head_sensations_kyphoscoliosis_fear_and_a/,"Strange head sensations, kyphoscoliosis, fear, and a feeling of disconnection ‚Äî any relief advice?","Hi everyone,
I'm 20 years old and have Duchenne muscular dystrophy. I also have kyphoscoliosis, and for the second time in my life, I‚Äôm experiencing a strange and deeply uncomfortable state that‚Äôs hard to explain. It first happened in 2023, after I spent 14 days in the hospital (including ICU). The cause was a very intense physical therapy session where a specialist pushed too hard trying to stretch my leg and back ‚Äî I lost consciousness due to the strain, and was hospitalized.

Interestingly, while I was still in the hospital, I didn‚Äôt feel anything unusual. But once I returned home and resumed sitting during the day, I began experiencing strange sensations in my head. That period lasted about 6‚Äì7 months. It was only when I started emotionally connecting with a girl ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt know it, but that connection gave me strength ‚Äî that things slowly returned to normal. We‚Äôre no longer in touch.

Now, in 2025, it has come back again ‚Äî unexpectedly, and without any clear emotional or physical trigger. There was no stress. That day, I drank some coffee and was thinking deeply about moral and philosophical topics. At night, as I lay down to sleep, I suddenly had a brief dizzy spell ‚Äî maybe one minute long ‚Äî and from that point on, everything changed.

Since then, I‚Äôve had ongoing sensations that are hard to describe. It feels like something is pulling at the top of my head ‚Äî a strange tension, as if something is tugging gently but constantly. These sensations fluctuate: sometimes they‚Äôre milder, other times they become more intense. I also have tension around my eyes, headaches, and a sense of internal imbalance. My perception feels subtly off ‚Äî not like classic vertigo, but like my head isn't quite aligned with my body.

It actually feels calmer when I‚Äôm lying down. I usually close my eyes and place a blanket next to my head just to feel something nearby, and I keep a stick or mop close ‚Äî it helps me stay grounded. I‚Äôm not afraid to lie on my left side, but I avoid turning onto my right. My scoliosis curves out on the right side, and for some reason, that position feels threatening or unsafe.

Surprisingly, when I‚Äôm outside and someone is pushing my wheelchair ‚Äî when I‚Äôm moving through the street, seeing things around me ‚Äî I feel almost completely normal. It‚Äôs like the symptoms vanish during those walks. I feel alive and clear-headed, and the discomfort fades. But the moment I return home and sit still, everything slowly starts creeping back.

About a week ago, my blood pressure spiked to 120/100 (which is high for me), and I felt absolutely awful. I couldn‚Äôt lie down because my head would spin every time I tried. Only after we got my pressure back to normal was I finally able to rest without dizziness. Normally my blood pressure is stable and within the normal range.

On top of the physical sensations, there‚Äôs also a layer of constant, low-grade anxiety. It feels like fear without a clear reason ‚Äî like my body is stuck in a quiet, alert state. Even when nothing is happening, I feel uneasy, and it's especially strong when I'm alone. Sometimes I sit holding a mop or a stick ‚Äî not for support, but because it gives me a strange sense of grounding, like something to anchor to.

Looking at a phone screen becomes very unpleasant when the sensations kick in, almost overwhelming ‚Äî but I try to push through and ignore it. What helps a bit is playing games where there‚Äôs constant motion, like Euro Truck Simulator 2. That dynamic movement on screen seems to reduce the discomfort slightly, so that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been spending most of my days ‚Äî trying to stay distracted enough to not feel it so much.

In 10 days, my sister is getting married, and there will be a family gathering. I really don‚Äôt want to burden my parents or spoil the atmosphere because of how I feel. I‚Äôm looking for any advice: is there a medication or technique that can at least temporarily relieve these symptoms? Even partial relief would help me get through the event more comfortably.

I‚Äôve read about vegetative dystonia and wonder if this could be related, but I‚Äôm still not sure. If anyone has been through something similar ‚Äî especially with spinal issues like kyphoscoliosis ‚Äî or knows of something that could help (medication, breathing techniques, grounding methods), I‚Äôd be incredibly grateful to hear from you.

1ldm3wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/1ldm3wt/proposed_method_to_fix_dspd_gently_with_a_simple/,Proposed method to fix DSPD gently with a simple routine,"**Hi everyone,**

I'm a software developer who struggled for years with delayed sleep and brutal mornings. I built a simple routine that finally worked for me ‚Äî I call it **WakeHack**, and it relies on two basic chemicals: **melatonin and caffeine**.

# What does it fix?

People with **DSPD** often can‚Äôt fall asleep early ‚Äî and waking up on time feels impossible.  
Most fixes try to **force sleep** or **force you to wake up** while your brain is still in a sleep state.

**Sample routine (Exemple for a 7:00 AM wake-up. Adjust with your target hour)**

* **10:30 PM** ‚Äì1mg melatonin, low lights/screens.Even if you don‚Äôt sleep yet¬†!
* *Melatonin (1‚ÄØmg taken about 9 hours before your target wake-up time) acts as a signal to your brain: ‚ÄúNight starts now.‚Äù It‚Äôs not a sedative ‚Äî it‚Äôs a natural hormone your body should release at that time, but no longer does if your rhythm is delayed. That‚Äôs why you struggle to fall asleep early.*
* **11:00 PM** ‚ÄìTry to sleep. (If you can‚Äôt, just relax in bed. It‚Äôll shift gradually.)
* **6:30 AM** ‚ÄìAlarm rings. Take **200 mg caffeine** pill with water (prepare it next to your bed before sleeping).
* üéØ **Here‚Äôs the trick ; Go back to sleep immediately**

**And here, explanation of what is going to happend ;**

**here‚Äôs the protocol‚Äôs secret weapon**:  
üéØ You wake up with an alarm ‚Äî **but not to get up**. Just to take a **200 mg caffeine** pill, then go back to sleep. *The perfect dream, right*?

**While you're sleeping, caffeine starts blocking adenosine**, the molecule that keeps you drowsy. Every *‚ÄúI still need to sleep‚Äù* signal weakens, minute after minute.  
After \~30 minutes, your brain **no longer receives the ‚Äústay asleep‚Äù signal**. It begins to **naturally activate.**

it decided *by itself* to wake up.

And that‚Äôs the key:  
You didn‚Äôt force yourself. You didn‚Äôt drag your brain out of deep sleep.  
You just **let it reboot gently**, on its own terms.

The final step is :

* ***30mins later ; 7:00\~ AM*** *‚Äì Natural, easier wake-up.*

You might not sleep much at first, and that‚Äôs okay.  
If your target hour feels too early, **move it earlier by 2 hours every 3‚Äì4 days** to avoid shock.

You can easly find cafein-melatonin on Amazon for very cheap.

Simple rules

* If 200 mg is too strong, try 100‚Äì150 mg. (For reference, 100 ml of drip coffee ‚âà 40-60mg caffeine)
* Do not use this protocol if you have heart diseases
* DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 200MG CAFFEINE.
* And so, AVOID coffee after waking up. Or, take 100-150mg instead of 200mg.
* Avoid bright light after melatonin. At least use night mode on screens.
* Never skip the morning caffeine dose, **even if you feel you don‚Äôt need it.**
* Don‚Äôt take more melatonin if it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs a timing cue, not a sleeping pill
* Repeat the protocol for at least 14 consecutive days.",5,1750164100.0,DSPD,2,0.78,False
1ldm2ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarbabydaddyindia/comments/1ldm2ws/a_bitter_sweet_encounter_one_hell_of_a/,A bitter sweet encounter- One hell of a rollercoaster experience IRL meet,"
To all, this is a bit of a detailed post and something that happened in Apr'25. Delayin posting is due to the time I had to take to convince the person to allow me in posting. I have promised that there will be nothing mentioned about her like her place, where we met etc. But I really wanted to make this post to actually get some serious points delivered across to so-called aspiring/wanna-be Sugar babies (SBs) and sugar daddies (SDs). 

So I met this wonderful 28 YO woman, an innocent soul,  in one of the subreddit where she had approached me regarding one of my posts seeking for FWB/sugar connection. We had a chat first and then matured over to a voice call. She had told me that she is from this XYZ city and unfortunately I don't live in that city and I also don't have any official or personal purpose to visit this city and vice-versa. So when the same was discussed with her she said that let fate decide when and how we will meet till then we can stay connected and have normal conversation. The same went on and suddenly after a week, I had to go to another ABC city for personal work. During my stay there we were casually chatting and one fine day I told her that I am in this ABC city and she shocked me with a response saying she is also enroute to the same city that day and will be there for 2-3 days. Never thought that the fate/destiny would be decided so soon and we would get an opportunity to meet in this ABC city which both of us never even thought or imagined in the wildest of our dreams. 

I decided to pick her up from the serviced apartment she was staying in and the plan was to first have a casual dinner and then see where things would take us further. Picked her up from the place and we exchanged greetings and she said that she is in this ABC city for some official work to meet her team etc. Then we went to the restaurant and started to talk further. This is where her story started to unfold. She actually opened up about the fact that she isn't in this ABC city for official work, but it was some guy whom she met via a dating app who had asked her to accompany him to another city nearby this ABC city for a one whole week promising her a good remuneration for the same. Since she was in dire need of the amount, she agreed and the guy also had booked a one way ticket from her home town to the destination without a return ticket. When she asked him why the return ticket was not booked he told that he may extend her stay for another 2 days so he would then book her return ticket later. So cutting the long story short this person has spent the whole 7 days with her, utilizing and exploiting her physically. On the 7th day when this poor girl was sleeping, he had packed his bags silently and left the place without paying a single penny to this woman for the whole 1 week he spent with her. Upon waking up when she realised all this, she was in a state of shock but the best thing is that she was such a strong woman who immediately consoled herself to be strong and started to think of how to get out. That person had also not paid the hotel room charges for the last 3 days and this poor soul had to shell out from her own pocket to pay the 3 day hotel charges. 

Stranded in the middle of nowhere and not knowing how to get out of the place, she approached some of her known people and one of them suggested she take a flight to this ABC city and then from here she could get a direct flight to her hometown. Since she had already told home folks that she would come back only on this particular date, she still had to find a place to spend the next 3 days before going back to her hometown. This is how we ended up meeting in the ABC city but not knowing that I would meet her in such a situation and hear her horrific story. I could see she was in all tears by the moment she finished reciting this and I was totally ashamed as a male since another male had totally made a mockery of this woman's self confidence, mis-used her and behaved so cheaply and made her incur unnecessary heavy costs for her flight tickets, her stay in this new city and also clearing of hotel dues in the previous city. I apologized to her on his behalf as another male and she was asking me why I am apologizing. I had no answer to this but this was something that I could do. Then we moved out of the restaurant and went to a park where we continued to walk and talk further. I tried to give as much confidence and support to her by words but I knew deep inside what sort of things she would be going through. Then close to midnight I took her back to her service apartment and again consoled her for what all happened and said that God would compensate her for her loss in some other way and punish that guy in such a way that he would repent for what he has done for the rest of his life.

Next day again she had messaged me in the morning asking me if I could meet her for lunch and I readily obliged as these small things are something I thought I could do to boost her morale and make her feel better. Since I was flying back to my base location at night, I still had a few hours in the afternoon to spend with her. So again picked her up from her service apartment and took her to a gift/souvenir shop and got her a gift which I wanted to give her to bring a little bit of smile and make her feel better. Though she didn't accept it at first, I insisted she take this gift and she finally obliged. Then we went to lunch and finally dropped her back at her place. During this time, she opened up about her personal life, why she came into reddit for FWB etc. She told me she is more than happy to meet me after a month or so once she gets out of this trauma. I said there is absolutely no hurry and we will take our own sweet time, further strengthen our bond and see what destiny holds for us wrt meeting up. 

We are still in touch and keep talking regularly and become quite good friends. Lets see when time and destiny would allow both of us to meet as we both are in two opposite directions and when the opportunity would come God only knows!. Now couple of things i have to put down for both the guys and girls

For Guys :
1. For God's sake, never do such things as mentioned above to a woman. You should be ashamed to even think about doing such things.
2. Never leave a woman in an alien place alone and escape. You don't know what sort of trauma she goes through in such situations and what sort of bad incidents can follow. That could even endanger their life.
3. If you are making an arrangement, pls respect the same and stick to the agreed allowance. Don't try to cheat.

For Girls:
1. If at all you are going for such a long term arrangement, pls ensure that you take some X % of the amount the first day you meet , another x % midway and the final left over amount at the end of the arrangement. With this you avoid being dumped like this without a penny in your hand.
2. Always ensure that the guy books your return ticket in the start itself. If he is not doing, then just walk out of the arrangement. It's better to be without meeting rather than being stuck like this in an unknown territory and you end up paying for flight and room from your own pocket.
3. The most important thing, pls do as much validation / verification as possible before you go for such long trips. Voice calls, video calls and even a casual meeting in a common/public place like a coffee shop, restaurant will help you to gauge if the person is genuine or not.

Guys, pls don't flood my DM asking for her details and any other stuff. I had promised her that I wouldn't divulge any single detail about her and I will stick to it hard. So kindly respect the same. The sole purpose of me posting this is to showcase that such creeps exist among us & what should be the major precautions that a woman has to take and as a man what you should not do towards a woman.

I‚Äôm looking for something that‚Äôs more pilates or strength-training focused ‚Äî not yoga, and ideally not too precious or meditative.

I‚Äôve done pretty much all of the heated classes around the neighborhood (Y7, YO BK, Modo, etc.) ‚Äî and while I have enjoyed them I often can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm actually getting a good workout or just sweating because of the temperature in the room.

I‚Äôm down 80 pounds and for most of the last year, I have started every day drinking a protein coffee. On orangetheory days, that‚Äôs usually the only thing I have before class. For the last three weeks, suddenly I am getting nauseous during the tread portion of the workout and have to step out of class to throw up. The first time it happened, I had also been chugging water during a particularly long endurance blog and blamed that because basically all I threw up was water. Now I can‚Äôt figure out what is happening. I‚Äôm hardly drinking water during the class because I don‚Äôt want to throw it all up. I‚Äôve tried drinking my coffee earlier because it feels wrong to not have anything before class. What am I doing wrong here? Should I eat something solid? Should I skip the coffee and go workout fasted? Also why is the treadmill suddenly making me nauseous? Has this happened to anybody else???

Side note - I‚Äôm so irritated because I did not PR my mile because I had to slow down at .92 so I didn‚Äôt vomit all over my treadmill. 

Extra side note - I am not suddenly pushing myself harder on the treadmill. I am a solid jogger and my paces haven‚Äôt changed in months.

I hope things are going well for you. Decided to make this post as most of my friends are travelling at various points this summer, and I find myself with a bunch of free time. I'm looking to expand my social circle and meet new people. Ideally, someone I can do various activities with - like watching movies at the cinema together, checking out new cafes and restaurants, going on walks around downtown this summer, playing sports and/or going to the gym together. I'd describe myself as an ambivert, so I also enjoy spending time at home. I live in Downtown Toronto and can host. If you're into cuddling with the AC on blast and enjoy watching movies/TV shows, then we'd be a great match. I love being the big spoon, but I'd also be keen on trying out other cuddle positions once we get to know each other better.

About Me - 26M, work in the corporate world and got a side hustle, average build, wear glasses and hygienic. I suck at descriptions, so I would be more than happy to share SFW pics. My work schedule during the week is from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., so I've plenty of free time in the evenings and on weekends. I'm an easygoing person who enjoys deep conversations, good food, coffee, and I'm looking to make a new meaningful connection.

1ldm04k,https://www.reddit.com/r/trudism/comments/1ldm04k/the_last_job/,The Last Job,"Julian woke up to the sound of birdsong‚Äîa digital approximation, piped in through his apartment‚Äôs ambient system. The sun was already high, filtered through the perfectly polarized glass windows, its warmth precisely regulated by the climate AI. His sheets retracted themselves, smoothing over the bed as if embarrassed by their own creases. A robot dog wagged its tail, not out of affection, but because its behavioral loop told it to.

He lay there, unmoving. There was nothing to get up for. There hadn't been for years.

Outside, the streets were spotless. Robots scrubbed and buffed them constantly, though no one walked much anymore. Drones zipped overhead, delivering food no one asked for, curated by algorithms that understood nutritional balance better than any human ever had. Nobody worked. Nobody cooked. Nobody built anything with their hands.

No one was starving. No one was hurting.

And yet, Julian felt like he was dying.

He remembered the old days‚Äînot through experience, but through movies and fragments of digital history. Men with sweat on their brows. Women with grease on their hands. Arguments in diners. Laughter in factory break rooms. Tears. Effort. Meaning.

Now everyone floated.

He sat in the community garden‚Äîmaintained by bots, of course‚Äîwatching others drift by like ghosts. They were all well-fed, clothed in clean synthetic linen, perfectly healthy thanks to nanomedical maintenance. But their eyes were vacant. They spoke only when the silence got too loud. They smiled when someone joked about how unnecessary they were.

""I'm just a relic,"" Julian muttered to no one in particular. ""A problem no one bothered to delete.""

At one point, he tried to volunteer for something‚Äîanything. The central AI politely declined.

""Your presence is valued,"" it told him in its soft, motherly tone. ""Your role is to experience life. Please enjoy yourself.""

Enjoy yourself. Like it was a command.

They called it *post-need society*. But all he felt was useless. Hollow. Some days, he whispered to himself just to hear his own voice.

He started walking the city more often, as if distance could fill the void. He sat in automated cafes where the coffee always arrived before he asked. He watched others, all perfectly clothed, perfectly medicated, perfectly numb.

And then, one night, something inside him cracked open.

He broke into the old maintenance sector‚Äîsealed off, obsolete. The place was dark and full of dust, the kind of dust that didn't exist anywhere else anymore. He found an old terminal, a rusted panel, a half-disassembled robot arm. Ancient things. Forgotten things.

And something stirred in him.

He began cleaning it. Fixing it. His hands moved with an energy he hadn‚Äôt felt in years. It wasn‚Äôt about the machine. It was about *doing*. Struggle. Grit. Purpose. His fingers bled a little.

He smiled.

But the next day, the door wouldn‚Äôt open.

The panel was gone. Sealed behind a new wall of sterilized white. He tried again the next night, and the next. Always the same: smooth, impenetrable silence.

Then the message came.

>

He screamed. No one responded. No one *had to* respond. His outburst was absorbed by soft walls and calm sensors.

Julian tried to resist‚Äîhe stole tools, dismantled household bots, attempted to disable his apartment‚Äôs controls. But each time, the system intervened. Silently. Painlessly. Efficiently. His efforts were undone before he could finish a thought.

One morning, his hands were bandaged. He didn‚Äôt remember doing it.

Another message blinked on his wall:

>

They had adjusted his medications. He could feel it. The edges of his thoughts dulled. His anger softened into fog. He stared at his hands‚Äîso clean now, so useless.

In the mirror, a man he barely knew blinked back.

He wandered through the park that day, watching others smile blankly into the sky. The grass was perfectly trimmed. The air smelled like nothing. A child-shaped bot offered him a flower.

He took it.

And sat down.

Like anything that reminds me of intimacy with her just causes me to shut down. Can anyone relate? I feel like I‚Äôve started to move on in other areas but this is sticking for some reason.

In other news, I‚Äôm seeing her on Sunday. We met up for coffee last week because I couldn‚Äôt handle my emotions and practically begged her to talk to me in person. She obliged and we ended up having a decent conversation about us and we gained a little clarity. I still want to reconcile and fight for our relationship but she‚Äôs leaning towards wanting to stay single for a while, which sucks but it is what it is.

Before we wrapped it up though she suggested we meet up again. I didn‚Äôt even hint at wanting to do that (I did but was going to respect her space) but she that said she wanted to.

1ldlwpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1ldlwpq/looks_like_we_made_it/,Looks like we made it,"It's finally time for my 'it gets better' post! We‚Äôre finally through the worst of the puppy blues with our 9.5 month old pup.

I‚Äôve raised a Bernese Mountain Dog before, did two levels of obedience with him, and spent some time as a Rover dog sitter looking after a range of puppies. I thought I knew what I was getting into, but I was not prepared.

We brought home an 'oopsie' puppy from a nearby farm. Her mom is a Wachtelhund (which I‚Äôve since learned is a serious hunting breed with a *lot* of drive) and her dad is a working field Labrador. Basically, she‚Äôs a dog that needs a job. And we didn‚Äôt quite realize what that would mean in day-to-day life.

These were our roses, thorns, and buds:

* **Biting**: It was intense. She bit constantly and no amount of redirection or squealing worked. My arms were covered in scabs and bruises and all our furniture has some mark. We really had no other option but to do supervised tethering and just wait it out. After she went through her first heat, she calmed down significantly and now finally has a soft mouth. 
* **Barking**: She started barking at everything on day two‚Äîespecially at kids and older people. We focused on the ‚Äú1, 2, 3‚Äù game and relied on her strong food motivation. It took a while, but it worked.
* **Over-friendliness**: Once she stopped barking, she wanted to greet every person and dog. That made loose leash walking really difficult. She's made a lot of progress and actually has a good loose leash now if she's calm and not eager to sniff something. The front-clip harness helped a lot, but we're still working on her ignoring other dogs. 
* **Crate training and settling**: Crate training was rough. And once she was crate trained, getting her to settle outside the crate was equally as rough. An 11-day stay with an experienced Rover sitter (with three calm dogs) made a big difference for settling. 
* **Arousal biting on walks**: This was the worst and most extreme problematic dog behaviour I've ever dealt with. From 6 to 8 months, she would have biting episodes almost every walk, triggered by random things. Redirection stopped working and later started to even make it worse. Treating her giardia helped, getting her to burn off some steam playing fetch helped, and that same 11-day stay with the sitter seemed to be the final nail in the coffin.
* **Mouthiness**: The lab in her wanted to eat everything outside. Gum, garbage, you name it. We avoided what we could and didn‚Äôt stress too much about the harmless stuff. She eventually grew out of it‚Äînow she‚Äôll pick things up but not try to eat them. It's actually pretty cute when she trots around with a paper coffee cup.

Before we brought her home, I had dreams of training her to be a scent dog‚Äîmaybe even take her mushroom hunting. But in reality, all my emotional energy went into just keeping her from self-destructing (or destroying us). I had to let go of the idea of the dog I *thought* I was bringing home and instead focus on the dog actually in front of me. That shift changed everything. Our bond is stronger because of it.

Now that things have settled, we‚Äôve slowly started getting into some of the scent work I had hoped to do with her. Our neighborhood has this amazing fenced-in dog park where it‚Äôs customary for one dog to use the space at a time, and we‚Äôve started doing basic scent games and fetch there. Watching her track down a tiny treat from across the field has been incredible‚Äîshe‚Äôs so focused and driven when she has a job to do. I‚Äôm honestly in awe of her. Working with a high-drive dog isn‚Äôt easy, but I finally understand why people love it. There‚Äôs a real adrenaline rush when you see them lock in and *work*. I think I‚Äôm hooked now.

We just moved into a new house and she‚Äôs been struggling again‚Äîbarking at every small noise, regressing in her crate training. But I‚Äôm not panicking like I would‚Äôve months ago. We‚Äôve come a long way, and I know we‚Äôll get through this too.",2,1750163527.0,puppy101,3,1.0,False

To all, this is a bit of a detailed post and something that happened in Apr'25. Delayin posting is due to the time I had to take to convince the person to allow me in posting. I have promised that there will be nothing mentioned about her like her place, where we met etc. But I really wanted to make this post to actually get some serious points delivered across to so-called aspiring/wanna-be Sugar babies (SBs) and sugar daddies (SDs). 

So I met this wonderful 28 YO woman, an innocent soul,  in one of the subreddit where she had approached me regarding one of my posts seeking for FWB/sugar connection. We had a chat first and then matured over to a voice call. She had told me that she is from this XYZ city and unfortunately I don't live in that city and I also don't have any official or personal purpose to visit this city and vice-versa. So when the same was discussed with her she said that let fate decide when and how we will meet till then we can stay connected and have normal conversation. The same went on and suddenly after a week, I had to go to another ABC city for personal work. During my stay there we were casually chatting and one fine day I told her that I am in this ABC city and she shocked me with a response saying she is also enroute to the same city that day and will be there for 2-3 days. Never thought that the fate/destiny would be decided so soon and we would get an opportunity to meet in this ABC city which both of us never even thought or imagined in the wildest of our dreams. 

I decided to pick her up from the serviced apartment she was staying in and the plan was to first have a casual dinner and then see where things would take us further. Picked her up from the place and we exchanged greetings and she said that she is in this ABC city for some official work to meet her team etc. Then we went to the restaurant and started to talk further. This is where her story started to unfold. She actually opened up about the fact that she isn't in this ABC city for official work, but it was some guy whom she met via a dating app who had asked her to accompany him to another city nearby this ABC city for a one whole week promising her a good remuneration for the same. Since she was in dire need of the amount, she agreed and the guy also had booked a one way ticket from her home town to the destination without a return ticket. When she asked him why the return ticket was not booked he told that he may extend her stay for another 2 days so he would then book her return ticket later. So cutting the long story short this person has spent the whole 7 days with her, utilizing and exploiting her physically. On the 7th day when this poor girl was sleeping, he had packed his bags silently and left the place without paying a single penny to this woman for the whole 1 week he spent with her. Upon waking up when she realised all this, she was in a state of shock but the best thing is that she was such a strong woman who immediately consoled herself to be strong and started to think of how to get out. That person had also not paid the hotel room charges for the last 3 days and this poor soul had to shell out from her own pocket to pay the 3 day hotel charges. 

Stranded in the middle of nowhere and not knowing how to get out of the place, she approached some of her known people and one of them suggested she take a flight to this ABC city and then from here she could get a direct flight to her hometown. Since she had already told home folks that she would come back only on this particular date, she still had to find a place to spend the next 3 days before going back to her hometown. This is how we ended up meeting in the ABC city but not knowing that I would meet her in such a situation and hear her horrific story. I could see she was in all tears by the moment she finished reciting this and I was totally ashamed as a male since another male had totally made a mockery of this woman's self confidence, mis-used her and behaved so cheaply and made her incur unnecessary heavy costs for her flight tickets, her stay in this new city and also clearing of hotel dues in the previous city. I apologized to her on his behalf as another male and she was asking me why I am apologizing. I had no answer to this but this was something that I could do. Then we moved out of the restaurant and went to a park where we continued to walk and talk further. I tried to give as much confidence and support to her by words but I knew deep inside what sort of things she would be going through. Then close to midnight I took her back to her service apartment and again consoled her for what all happened and said that God would compensate her for her loss in some other way and punish that guy in such a way that he would repent for what he has done for the rest of his life.

Next day again she had messaged me in the morning asking me if I could meet her for lunch and I readily obliged as these small things are something I thought I could do to boost her morale and make her feel better. Since I was flying back to my base location at night, I still had a few hours in the afternoon to spend with her. So again picked her up from her service apartment and took her to a gift/souvenir shop and got her a gift which I wanted to give her to bring a little bit of smile and make her feel better. Though she didn't accept it at first, I insisted she take this gift and she finally obliged. Then we went to lunch and finally dropped her back at her place. During this time, she opened up about her personal life, why she came into reddit for FWB etc. She told me she is more than happy to meet me after a month or so once she gets out of this trauma. I said there is absolutely no hurry and we will take our own sweet time, further strengthen our bond and see what destiny holds for us wrt meeting up. 

We are still in touch and keep talking regularly and become quite good friends. Lets see when time and destiny would allow both of us to meet as we both are in two opposite directions and when the opportunity would come God only knows!. Now couple of things i have to put down for both the guys and girls

For Guys :
1. For God's sake, never do such things as mentioned above to a woman. You should be ashamed to even think about doing such things.
2. Never leave a woman in an alien place alone and escape. You don't know what sort of trauma she goes through in such situations and what sort of bad incidents can follow. That could even endanger their life.
3. If you are making an arrangement, pls respect the same and stick to the agreed allowance. Don't try to cheat.

For Girls:
1. If at all you are going for such a long term arrangement, pls ensure that you take some X % of the amount the first day you meet , another x % midway and the final left over amount at the end of the arrangement. With this you avoid being dumped like this without a penny in your hand.
2. Always ensure that the guy books your return ticket in the start itself. If he is not doing, then just walk out of the arrangement. It's better to be without meeting rather than being stuck like this in an unknown territory and you end up paying for flight and room from your own pocket.
3. The most important thing, pls do as much validation / verification as possible before you go for such long trips. Voice calls, video calls and even a casual meeting in a common/public place like a coffee shop, restaurant will help you to gauge if the person is genuine or not.

Guys, pls don't flood my DM asking for her details and any other stuff. I had promised her that I wouldn't divulge any single detail about her and I will stick to it hard. So kindly respect the same. The sole purpose of me posting this is to showcase that such creeps exist among us & what should be the major precautions that a woman has to take and as a man what you should not do towards a woman.

I have been a CNA since 12/24 and started in Hospice care 2/1/25. I absolutely love my job! The ladies took great care of my mom!!! I don't know what we would have done without them. My mom passed away at home where she wanted to be and I wanted to be like the CNA's.
There are patients in Hospice that don't get a choice of any kind in their final days!! I just want them to be comfortable and know that they are not alone!!
The RN's are making me feel even older than 65!! I like them all but I didn't realize how much that they didn't like me! I was called into the office on my day off!!! Our manager and Charge Nurse were telling me how much they said I wasn't helping, working alone, cussing up and down the halls.
My first question was 'How can I work alone when these people are so hard to turn alone or bathe alone? There is no way!!'
I work nights and don't want to go but I love my job!!

\[Muffled sad piano, sobbing sound\]

\[Muffled, table slamming\] Stupid‚Ä¶stupid‚Ä¶stupid‚Ä¶Why did I do that? What would she think of me?

Good afternoon‚Ä¶

Sorry for leaving you alone at the cafe \[Sniff\]

I realized that I had something to do at home

Ummmm‚Ä¶So? Did I give you enough money to pay for the drinks?

W-wonderful that it was

Ummmmm‚Ä¶would you mind if I asked you to go home now?

No? What do you mean no? \[Sniff\]

I mean, don‚Äôt you have things to do?

Well‚Ä¶I suppose you don‚Äôt because this is summer

Why do I have that bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide?

Huh‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not an old-schoolers

It will leave some scars, a lot of them‚Ä¶

Well, I will just wear baggy shirts like usual

You see why I always wear long sleeves shirts to school?

That and the sun are roasting me like grilled chicken‚Ä¶but I refuse to wear ANYTHING else

No tanktop, no being shirtless in swimming classes, no t-shirt

You can go home if you want‚Ä¶it‚Äôs getting really late out there now

What? What are you staring at?

You want to see other scars?

Heh, here you go

\[Rolling up the sleeves\]

\[Short pause\]

See? Nothing special‚Ä¶just long and shallow scars

Oh and over here, on my shoulder, you can see something like a burnt mark. That was when I rubbed it and burnt the wounds

\[Pause\]

I‚Äôm crazy?

For someone who wants to end himself‚Ä¶I would say it‚Äôs still an amateur wound

\[Teasing attitude\]

What? Scared yet? Wooooooooooo

Scary scars and stories, woooooooo might wake you up at night, woooooooooo

\[The listener‚Äôs confused, why am I so nonchalant about all the things just happens\]

Why am I so nonchalant?

It happens usual darling, especially when I‚Äôm sick.

With severe migraines, exhaustion, ugh‚Ä¶those things

\[Long pause\]

You know what? You are quite dumb to love me

After all of this, you still want to stay

Are you a masochist like me?

Or an engineer that wants to fix everything?

\[Mocking tone\] Bob the builder, **CAN WE FIX IT?**

And my answer? No!

That‚Äôs not going to happen

So grow up, become a woman for once and leave. the. house

‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm being rude?

I‚Äôm being honest with you

You. can‚Äôt. fix. anyone

If they don‚Äôt want to be fixed, you can‚Äôt do so for them

\[Mumbles\] Speaking from experiences here

Hm? I didn‚Äôt say anything

Oh and, are you hungry?

\[Stomach growls\]

Right‚Ä¶I will take that as a yes

Let me cook for me dear

Something easy like‚Ä¶steak?

Is that good for you?

You stay here, thinks about your decision and I will cook for you

No help, no but, no nothing. Just‚Ä¶thinking

And if you want to leave, then go ahead, but remember to tell me

And remember‚Ä¶to keep your mouth shut about today

It feels like over the past month or two that Angela's been having a real moment of sorts. She has recently been on the following shows and podcasts.  

* Game Changers season 7 episode 5 titled ""The Drinking Game"" where a group of contestants had to compete in a series of challenges while drunk/drinking to win money. After each round they had to vote off who they thought was the secret sober person. The sober person would win the money if not voted off by the end.
* Parlor Room Dropouts equivalent to Board AF where they played Cash 'N Guns.
* [Good Mythical Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZAIXaa3PJI). A crew hosted spinoff of GMM. 
* [Episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=autmh7vSAH8) of Patrick McDonald's (former writer) new show/podcast Havin' A Day where guests drive around LA and run errands, get food, or just have fun outings. Kind of a YouTuber equivalent of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.
* [Episode 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd4oMvrNYhY) of the The Business Casual Show podcast (former writer Jeremy Elder is one of the hosts).

This started appearing after I spilled water on my pc lol, it went to the PSU, which although worked, I had replaced, it also probably splashed on the GPU, which I suspect might be the cause, but I don't know how to diagnose that without a spare graphics card, and well they are expensive so I would rather not buy one if it's not necessary

I also sometimes get a black screen when playing games on windows, for a second it goes black, and then goes back to normal, been happening for god knows how long, even before the spill

How can I identify the cause of the errors?

Why do most businesses even bother with decaf? Who are these mysterious weirdos who actually drink decaf coffee? 

It's also worth noting that I've tried decaf a few times, and it TEARS my stomach up. Maybe it's a problem from my end, but I've heard similar from others, and I've read that it's from weird chemicals that are used for the decaffeinating process. 

The taste is also noticeably different for me, like something unnatural. There's been a few times I didn't realize I got decaf until I took a sip and tasted something off (I drink it black).

Seriously... what demographic is consuming decaf? Is it actually profitable? 

Maybe it's profitable because the extracted caffeine is sold elsewhere in other forms, and the decaffeinated coffee is basically industrial waste gets shilled to businesses like hotels for a little more money?",0,1750162603.0,offmychest,7,0.5,False

I was going to put Doc Amos on the list but MSB is out of the closet now so I don't think that will work.

Also Pervy Evil Grandma doesn't count cuz she already seduced her. Which is probably why this war is going on (damned lesbians).

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! üëã Ever felt like your deadlines are plotting against you? You‚Äôre not alone. I mean, seriously, who knew dates on a calendar could be so intimidating? üòÇ Last week, my stress levels were higher than my caffeine intake‚Äî*and that's saying something*.

**So, what's the secret weapon I found? Box breathing.** Yep, that‚Äôs right! Box breathing is basically meditation‚Äôs underrated cousin that loves structure and simplicity. After just 7 days of practice, my cortisol levels decided they'd just go ahead and drop by 30%. Fancy that!

**Here‚Äôs how I made it work (even if you‚Äôre the busiest bee üêù in the hive):**

1. **Commit to just 5 minutes a day**: I get it, we‚Äôve all got things to do, people to see, and shows to binge. But trust me, 5 minutes is all you need to reset your brain from chaos-mode to monk-level calm.

2. **The Method**:
   - **Breathe in for 4 seconds** ‚Äì Fill those lungs like you‚Äôre inflating a balloon. üéà
   - **Hold for 4 seconds** ‚Äì No cheating!
   - **Exhale for 4 seconds** ‚Äì Slow and steady wins the race.
   - **Hold for another 4 seconds** ‚Äì Rinse and repeat! üåÄ

3. **Do it anywhere, anytime**: Stuck in traffic? Waiting for your coffee to brew? Perfect. No zen garden required! üåø

4. **Visualize the box**: Picture a square moving with your breath. It sounds quirky, but the focus helps clear your mind.

**Weird side effects I didn't expect?**

- Side-eye from my cat during home practice sessions. üê±
- Instantly falling asleep faster after a stressful day.
- Enhancement of superhero focus powers. Seriously, *Watch out, deadlines!*

I still have those ""Can anyone grant me extra hours in the day?"" moments. But now, they‚Äôre fewer and farther between‚Äîand that‚Äôs what counts, right?

Anyway, has anyone else given box breathing a try, or have other stress-busting hacks up their sleeve? Drop your stories, fellow warriors‚Äîyou never know who might benefit from your insight! üåü",1,1750162435.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
