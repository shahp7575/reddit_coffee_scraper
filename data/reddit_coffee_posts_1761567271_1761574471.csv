1ohfipj,https://i.redd.it/brvi9m2awnxf1.jpeg,Moneyra - Offline Expense Tracker built with React Native + Expo (new architecture + iCloud sync),"Hey everyone!

Just launched [Moneyra](https://www.moneyra.app/), a personal finance tracker fully built with React Native + Expo SDK 53 using the new architecture.  
It‚Äôs offline-first, powered by WatermelonDB, and supports native iCloud backups - no accounts, no servers, just local-first data and smooth sync.

Also used NativeWind + Tailwind for styling and RevenueCat for subscriptions.

If you‚Äôre curious how it‚Äôs built - the entire setup is available in my template [NativeLaunch](http://nativelaunch.dev), so you can literally start from the same stack I used for this app.

Another long night in the lab ‚Äî the coffee machine‚Äôs been running on overdrive again. The head technician‚Äôs buried in his notes, rewriting, refining, reconstructing. The crew‚Äôs on their own tonight ‚Äî no guidance, no hand-holding, just the quiet hum of machines and the glow of the monitors.

Every line he writes comes with a memory ‚Äî the process, the method, the failures that led to breakthroughs. He‚Äôs stripped consoles down to their digital DNA, dissected them, learned their secrets. The data he‚Äôs gathered over these sleepless days ‚Äî priceless. Every bit of knowledge hard-earned, every result a mark of obsession finally paying off.

The whiteboard‚Äôs a battlefield ‚Äî scattered diagrams, scribbles, fragments of thought. To anyone else, chaos. To him, a map ‚Äî every mark a step closer to something only he can see.

They say he‚Äôs not working on much lately. They‚Äôre wrong. He‚Äôs working on everything at once ‚Äî ten projects tangled into one. He even got some ‚Äúoutside assistance‚Äù on the book cover design, though everything else remains his ‚Äî pure blood, sweat, and caffeine.

The next few days, the lab‚Äôs going to light up again. Plans to be drawn, systems to test, battles to fight. The head tech‚Äôs already prepped ‚Äî extra jars of coffee, sugar, milk. He calls it ‚Äúwar fuel.‚Äù The rest of us just call it another night in the lab.

A while ago, I decided to do something small for myself.
No plans, no goals  I just felt like I needed to breathe.
So I went out early, grabbed a coffee, found a quiet spot, and played an old song I used to love.

After a few minutes, I realized I was smiling for no reason.
It wasn‚Äôt forced, it just happened.
Maybe because, for the first time in a long while, I was simply with myself  and that was enough.

Have you ever felt that quiet kind of peace, where everything just slows down for a moment?

So I finally did it I booked a flight to Lisbon for next month. I‚Äôve heard so many good things about the city and it just feels like the right place to start my next adventure. I‚Äôve heard Lisbon is full of life the steep streets, trams, ocean breeze and all those pastel buildings. I can already picture myself walking through Alfama with a coffee in hand. I‚Äôll be working remotely while I‚Äôm there but I want to make the most of my time off exploring and maybe connecting with other travelers or locals.I need to find something online to make that easier so it aligns with my schedule and their schedule aswell.  
There‚Äôs something about starting fresh in a new city that feels grounding even if you‚Äôre thousands of miles from home.

1ohfewg,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonelymeyerspod/comments/1ohfewg/quaid_madness_round_1_cubicle_fight_vs_i_broke_my/,"Quaid Madness, Round 1: Cubicle Fight vs. I Broke My Arm","The final stretch of Round 1 starts with (38) Cubicle Fight, which first aired in 2006, against (91) I Broke My Arm, which first aired in 2010.  

**Cubicle Fighter Elevator Pitch:** Employees Gary (Bill Hader) and Steve (Dane Cook) get into a fight to the death over possession of a cubicle; meanwhile, their boss (Jason Sudeikis) is oblivious to the goings on and just wants status on ""the Higgins report""  

Cubicle Fight Watch it here:** https://youtu.be/RmGe5-FtrVg?si=ShuHk0Cg77T947Gs 

**Pros for Advancing:**  
-As Kiv mentioned on the pod, this short includes a lot of hitters from An Golden Era; in addition to Bill and Sudeikis, we've got Seth, Andy, Fred Armisen, Will Forte, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Kenan Thompson, and Kristen Wiig   
-Incredible use of props  
-The post-it that gets stuck in Bill's hair  
-Genuinely so hilarious that Fred is screaming in pain after getting coffee thrown in his face, but then immediately stops and just stands there quietly as soon as Suds saunters over   
-Intense battle using all these random office supplies only for us to learn at the very end that there was a knife on the desk the whole time  
-As @eduardomunhoz1581 says on YouTube, ""I love how he was just hired and yet he is immediately prepared for exactly what's gonna happen as if it's just something normal that happens in every office in this universe""   

**Cons for Advancing:**  
-Not written by Andy, Akiva, or Jorma

**I Broke My Arm Elevator Pitch:** A high school student (Emma Stone) sings in her school's cafeteria about how she broke her arm because she slipped on some grape jelly. Each verse ends with her falling again and breaking a new appendage until eventually she is paralyzed, confined to a wheelchair, and only able to talk through a computer program. The grape jelly (Andy) then comes to life and sings about how it isn't actually his fault Emma broke every bone in her body  

**Watch it here:** https://youtu.be/l6vS99dEexI?si=VTZFgXD9rM6z_k6m

**Pros for Advancing:**   
-One of those shorts where you think it's going to be about one thing and then it ends up going in a completely different direction    
-Incredible escalation; gets progressively funnier and weirder   
-""Sign my keyboard. Sign my keyboard. Sign my keyboard. Sign my keyboard.""   
-The concept of a sentient blob of grape jelly singing ""the kid ain't mine, I was wearin' a jim hat"" is just ... A+, no notes   

**Cons for Advancing:**  
-Though I *personally* find it hilarious, some people might not enjoy the end-of-short turn of the jelly coming to life; Paste Magazine, for example, felt it didn't really add anything ""other than taking it down a strange path""  

Which short reigns supreme?

1ohfemo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1ohfemo/looking_suggestion_to_develop_an_automatic/,Looking suggestion to develop an Automatic Category Intelligent in my Personal Finance WebApp.,"Hey everyone,

We‚Äôre a small team from Tamil Nadu, India, building a personal finance web app, and we‚Äôre getting ready to launch our MVP in the next couple of weeks.

Right now, we‚Äôre exploring ideas to add some intelligence for auto-categorising transactions in our next release ‚Äî and I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or experiences on how we can approach this.

Here‚Äôs a quick example of what we‚Äôre trying to solve üëá

**Use case:**

Users can create simple rules to automatically categorise their upcoming transactions based on a keyword or merchant name.

**Example behaviour:**

* User A ‚Üí merchant = ""Ananda Bhavan"" ‚Üí category = Food
* User B ‚Üí merchant = ""Ananda Bhavan"" ‚Üí category = Restaurant
* User C ‚Üí merchant = ""Ananda Bhavan"" ‚Üí category = Snacks
* User D ‚Üí merchant = ""Ananda Bhavan"" ‚Üí category = Coffee Shop

Now, when a new user (User E) uploads a transaction from the same merchant ‚Äî ""Ananda Bhavan"" ‚Äî but has a custom category like Eating Out, the system should ideally map that merchant to Eating Out automatically.

**Our goals:**

* Learn that ‚ÄúAnanda Bhavan‚Äù is generally a restaurant that serves food, snacks, and coffee from aggregated user signals.
* Respect each user‚Äôs custom categories and rules, so the mapping feels personal.
* Offer a reliable default classification for new users, reducing manual edits and misclassifications.

Would love to hear how you‚Äôd approach this problem ‚Äî especially any ideas on what type of model or logic flow could work well here.

Also, if you know any tools or frameworks that could make life easier for a small team like ours, please do share! üôè

1ohfc1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ohfc1q/is_this_still_gastritis/,Is this still Gastritis?,"Ok I read like hundreds of posts on here for tips and tricks. Some has helped, some not. Given my situation I wanted to see what you think or if there is someone out there feeling the same?

So I was a big gym goer, had a lot of muscle and went down to sub 10% bodyfat. Basically gym and food are my life.

This March while on vacation I ate a bad fruit and got a terrible food poisoning out of it. Things went crazy downhill from there. Was on PPI (Pantoprazole) for a few weeks but things didn‚Äôt really improve. However, my symptoms have always been just feeling full and having reflux issues to the point of almost vomiting (no pain or anything really). Did an endoscopy and found that I have gastritis. H. Pylori was ruled out though. 

Stayed on panto for a week or two after diagnosis but things got worse so I didn‚Äôt take them any longer. My diet at this point was rice, chicken and broccoli. Nothing special but at the same time nothing I am not familiar with as a bodybuilder. However, as I was used to eating 4k kcal per day to maintain my muscle mass I lost weight rapidly. Within 3 months I lost more than 45lbs in muscle mass. Basically everything I‚Äôve built up. Sticking to my bland diet my stomach issues got slightly better but never fully recovered. Its mostly been phases. A few weeks where I feel almost normal and then a major crash where everything is terrible again.

It‚Äôs been 7 months of this up and down now and I feel only slightly better. So far we made an MRI for cancer and everything else around my stomach with no results, I‚Äôve made H2 breath tests to test for intolerance of fructose, glucose, lactose and so on with no results, I tried a plant based diet with no results, I tried homeopathy with no results. Kinda feel lost honestly since everything we try is negative or doesn‚Äôt yield any positive results. 

I‚Äôm currently back on PPI (Lanso this time) for two weeks now since a close friend with reflux issues recommended them to me as they helped him massively. They seem to help but at the same time they don‚Äôt. Still got my usual symptoms.

Don‚Äôt really know how to move forward at this point. I‚Äôm generally feeling okay. Like I don‚Äôt have any pain or discomfort. My symptoms are usually feeling full/bloated, burping like crazy and a lot of reflux which gaviscon keeps in check. And those symptoms are constant, like it gets slightly better when I eat but also sometimes get worse when I eat. 

I still eat rice and veggies daily, with good amounts of fresh meat (beef, chicken and pork) and fruits. Going to the gym twice a week and taking my usual EAAs during training (so twice a week) with added L-Glutamin. I don‚Äôt eat any fast food, no coffee or even fizzy drinks. Never have anyways. So I feel like I‚Äôm doing good on the diet side of things. However, I‚Äôm not getting close to enough kcal in daily so I‚Äôm still struggling to gain weight which bothers me a lot. 

However, reading all your posts I‚Äôm kinda curious if this even is gastritis at this point or something different? Talked to my doc about doing another endoscopy just to be sure but that appointment is in January next year as nothing earlier was available. It‚Äôs generally tough to even get a response from my doc. Tried to get other GI docs in the area but they usually don‚Äôt take new patients or have appointments mid next year at the earliest. Basically I‚Äôm living off information I gathered online. So I thought I opened a discussion on my case. 

Would love to discuss with you. At this point I feel like this is my only way to talk about my struggles.

It has been a while since I've been talking honestly about this. I've been trying to manage a couple of different communities recently, but deep down, I remain connected with two things that I love, learning and food.

On one end, I've initiated a small skill camp with a handful of students where we learn Data Structures & Algorithms just for the sake of pleasure and mental discipline, Dm me or comment to join us.

On the other, I'm operating a small food business in a tier-2 city (Ujjain).

The last two years have seen me understand that I can't be ""pan-Indian"" as far as cuisine goes. That's too wide and random. Instead, I'm concentrating on Northeastern and super Northern cuisines, and also toning down and improving on what we do already do well South Indian food, Punjabi and Main Course foods, pre packed lunch on the move, Sandwiches and Breakfast

Some of the platforms that have been instrumental to my success are Swiggy and Zomato they've enabled me to reach more people than I ever could have otherwise. If you're ever in Ujjain or Omkareshwar, you're more than welcome to stop by or have us cater for your party. ????

But I've also been dealing with a persistent issue that I know other food business folk can appreciate:

> People ordering online solely to post fake complaints.



They‚Äôll order, eat, and then claim the food was ‚Äústale‚Äù or ‚Äúbland‚Äù even when it wasn‚Äôt. Some even cancel after the food is dispatched, meaning the meal (and cost) is gone.

I‚Äôve started documenting such orders pattern-spotting the ‚Äúcrash‚Äù ones but responses from platforms remain lukewarm.

The bigger issue, though, is consumer education.
In tier-2 towns, individuals tend to have no exposure at all to proper Italian or other international food. For instance, I've been attempting to serve genuine Italian pasta and not the Indo-Chinese version everyone is accustomed to. But the locals somehow expect ""pasta"" to resemble chowmein with ketchup and chili sauce. When I present the actual aglio e olio or carbonara, they complain it is bland.

How do you define ""authenticity"" to an audience that's been trained to believe ""fusion = flavor""?

I've left pasta pre-made for now (testing waters), but will soon switch to handmade. Along the process, I've also introduced special drinks such as Panakam (which is apparently Lord Rama's favorite drink) and our Haatimaar Coffee a robust one which keeps you going for 8 straight hours.

Here's what I would like to talk about:

I'm operating with limited space, and I'm careful about growing too quickly. In smaller cities, room, personnel, and steady customer volume are actual challenges.

So the question I have for the community is:
How did you grow your food business (or any in-store setup) with minimal physical space without sacrificing quality or going out of business doing it?

Would love to hear from anyone who has scaled economically in the F&B industry, particularly in smaller cities or towns with emerging food cultures.

Thanks for reading and if anyone's traveling through Ujjain, the first Haatimaar Coffee is on me

1ohf80f,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1ohf80f/looking_suggestion_to_develop_an_automatic/,Looking suggestion to develop an Automatic Category Intelligent in my Personal Finance WebApp.,"Hey everyone,

We‚Äôre a small team from Tamil Nadu, India, building a personal finance web app, and we‚Äôre getting ready to launch our MVP in the next couple of weeks.

Right now, we‚Äôre exploring ideas to add some intelligence for auto-categorising transactions in our next release ‚Äî and I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or experiences on how we can approach this.

Here‚Äôs a quick example of what we‚Äôre trying to solve üëá

**Use case:**

Users can create simple rules to automatically categorise their upcoming transactions based on a keyword or merchant name.

* Example behaviour:
* User A ‚Üí merchant = ""Ananda Bhavan"" ‚Üí category = Food
* User B ‚Üí merchant = ""Ananda Bhavan"" ‚Üí category = Restaurant
* User C ‚Üí merchant = ""Ananda Bhavan"" ‚Üí category = Snacks
* User D ‚Üí merchant = ""Ananda Bhavan"" ‚Üí category = Coffee Shop

Now, when a new user (User E) uploads a transaction from the same merchant ‚Äî ""Ananda Bhavan"" ‚Äî but has a custom category like Eating Out, the system should ideally map that merchant to Eating Out automatically.

**Our goals:**

* Learn that ‚ÄúAnanda Bhavan‚Äù is generally a restaurant that serves food, snacks, and coffee from aggregated user signals.
* Respect each user‚Äôs custom categories and rules, so the mapping feels personal.
* Offer a reliable default classification for new users, reducing manual edits and misclassifications.

Would love to hear how you‚Äôd approach this problem ‚Äî especially any ideas on what type of model or logic flow could work well here.

Also, if you know any tools or frameworks that could make life easier for a small team like ours, please do share! üôè

Building a home in Southern California has always been a dream for many homeowners seeking the perfect balance between luxury, comfort, and lifestyle. With 2025 shaping up to be a transformative year for architecture and design, custom home trends in this region are evolving faster than ever. From sustainable materials to cutting-edge smart technologies, Southern California homes are becoming showcases of both creativity and conscious living.

## The Shift Toward Personalized Luxury

Homeowners today want more than just a beautiful property; they crave spaces that reflect their personal stories and daily routines. Builders are embracing this demand by offering highly customized layouts that go far beyond the traditional blueprint. This includes flexible living spaces, hidden storage solutions, and design elements that blend aesthetics with everyday practicality. The growing emphasis on craftsmanship, authenticity, and quality materials is shaping the way modern homes are being built.

For those seeking expert guidance in creating these one-of-a-kind properties, choosing the right [home builders in southern California](https://truehomebuildersca.com/) is critical. Experienced builders understand not just the structural demands of luxury construction but also the lifestyle aspirations of each homeowner. The best professionals offer end-to-end solutions‚Äîfrom design consultation to post-construction support‚Äîensuring that every square foot aligns with the owner‚Äôs vision.

## Smart Homes That Think for You

Smart home technology continues to dominate the 2025 housing scene. From integrated security systems to AI-powered lighting and energy management, the modern home has become more intuitive and efficient. Homeowners now control temperature, lighting, and entertainment systems with simple voice commands or through mobile apps. Sustainability remains a key driver here‚Äîsmart homes are not just convenient but also environmentally conscious.

Interestingly, a recent [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation) entry on home automation highlights how advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technology are making smart living accessible across all price ranges. This democratization of technology has encouraged many builders and remodelers to include smart infrastructure in even mid-range projects, creating long-term value for homeowners.

## Blending Commercial-Grade Design in Residential Spaces

A surprising trend in 2025 is the crossover between commercial and residential design. More homeowners are incorporating retail-inspired features like glass partitions, high-durability flooring, and open showroom-style kitchens. These elements are not just visually stunning but also practical for multi-use spaces.

This design movement is fueled by the expertise of seasoned [commercial contractors Orange county](https://truehomebuildersca.com/commercial-retail-remodeling/), who bring modern commercial innovation into home design. From luxury home offices to mini wellness centers, the influence of professional construction techniques ensures both style and structural integrity. The result is a fusion of comfort and function‚Äîperfect for the hybrid lifestyle many Californians now lead.

## Sustainable Building Materials and Design Ethics

Sustainability remains one of the strongest homebuilding trends of the decade. Homeowners and builders alike are opting for eco-friendly materials such as reclaimed wood, bamboo, and recycled metal. Energy-efficient windows, solar panels, and green roofs are becoming standard rather than optional upgrades. Water conservation technologies, like smart irrigation and low-flow plumbing, also play a key role in sustainable design.

The Southern California climate encourages these choices, with builders maximizing natural ventilation and sunlight while minimizing energy waste. Many of these projects now pursue LEED certification or similar sustainability benchmarks. As environmental awareness grows, so does the demand for homes that are both luxurious and responsible.

## Kitchen as the Heart of the Home

The kitchen has always been the centerpiece of a home, but 2025 brings it to new heights of innovation and beauty. Designers are focusing on open-concept kitchens that flow seamlessly into dining and living areas, creating social hubs that encourage connection. Functionality meets artistry through custom cabinetry, statement lighting, and the integration of smart appliances.

For those considering a stylish and practical upgrade, professional [kitchen remodeling Orange county](https://truehomebuildersca.com/kitchen-remodeling/) services can transform outdated spaces into modern masterpieces. From durable quartz countertops to hidden storage solutions, every detail contributes to both efficiency and elegance. Homeowners are also embracing earthy tones, natural textures, and minimalist aesthetics to create calming, timeless spaces that inspire everyday joy.

## The Rise of Indoor-Outdoor Living

Southern California‚Äôs climate is one of its greatest assets, and modern design trends are fully embracing it. Expansive sliding doors, covered patios, and outdoor kitchens blur the line between indoor and outdoor spaces. Whether it‚Äôs a morning coffee overlooking a garden or an evening gathering around a fire pit, homeowners want their outdoor areas to feel like natural extensions of their interiors.

Builders are integrating landscape design early in the planning process, ensuring seamless transitions between indoor flooring and outdoor decking. The result is a harmonious living environment that captures the essence of coastal California living‚Äîopen, warm, and effortlessly elegant.

## Multi-Generational and Flexible Floor Plans

Another emerging trend is adaptability. Many families are building homes with multiple generations in mind‚Äîoffering separate living quarters, private entrances, or flexible layouts that can evolve over time. This concept not only fosters family connection but also ensures long-term usability and investment value. In 2025, homes are no longer static structures but dynamic environments designed to evolve with their owners.

## Final Thoughts

Southern California‚Äôs homebuilding trends in 2025 are defined by innovation, sustainability, and personalization. From energy-efficient materials to smart technologies and open-concept layouts, the region continues to lead in setting architectural and lifestyle standards for the rest of the country. With experienced builders and designers leading the charge, the future of home construction in Southern California looks both beautiful and sustainable‚Äîa perfect reflection of its people and their forward-thinking spirit.

*By The Handicapper with a Six-Pack of Confidence (and a Snack-Sized Pity Pot for the Underdogs)*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
Let‚Äôs start with the cold, hard math. The odds favor Seattle Sounders (-225) over Minnesota United (+300), implying a 30.77% chance for the visitors and a 25% chance for the home side. The draw? A paltry 23.26%. But here‚Äôs the rub: Minnesota‚Äôs recent form is like a caffeinated beaver chiseling through playoff wood. They‚Äôve beaten Seattle twice this season, including a sweep at Lumen Field‚Äîa feat only achieved by elite clubs like PSG and Atl√©tico Madrid. Meanwhile, Seattle‚Äôs defense has been leakier than a colander in a monsoon, conceding 1.41 goals per game. Minnesota‚Äôs backline? A tidy 1.13 per game. The Sounders‚Äô offensive fireworks (1.71 goals per game) might not matter if their defense keeps playing Jenga with the opposition‚Äôs attacks.

The spread? Seattle‚Äôs -0.25, which means they‚Äôre expected to ‚Äúoutperform‚Äù Minnesota by a hair. But given Minnesota‚Äôs two recent wins and home advantage, this line feels like a magician‚Äôs trick‚Äîsleight of hand, but with more sweat and fewer rabbits.

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Experience, and a Dash of Drama**  
Seattle‚Äôs squad is missing key cogs: midfielders Pedro de la Vega and Paul Arriola (out), and center back Kim Kee-hee (questionable). Ouch. Their defense, already shaky, now looks like a group of toddlers playing Jenga. Meanwhile, Minnesota‚Äôs Kelvin Yeboah (9 goals this season) is fit, but defender Carlos Harvey is out‚Äîa blow for a team that relies on defensive discipline.

Seattle‚Äôs coach Brian Schmetzer, a playoff legend with a 68.3% win rate, isn‚Äôt sweating it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident against any team,‚Äù he said, probably while sipping artisanal coffee from a thermos labeled ‚ÄúChampionship or Bust.‚Äù Minnesota, meanwhile, hasn‚Äôt won a playoff game in regulation since 2020.

1ohf1ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/visitlondon/comments/1ohf1ra/day_out_in_london_mid_december/,Day out in London mid December,"Hi all. I‚Äôm looking for ideas for me (60f) and my daughter (25f) to spend a day in London the week before Christmas. I used to live in London (a few years ago now!) so am not interested in obvious touristy stuff. We are going to do a Christmas lights tour (walking route planned) and will no doubt have lunch & some drinks. 

Last year at about the same time we spent a day walking along the South Bank, went for a coffee, to the Tate Modern and then walked to Covent Garden. We ended up eating & having some drinks at Seven Dials Market which had a DJ and was crowded but lively with a great atmosphere. 

I hate shopping, am not a fan of Christmas Markets (did that last year) and Winter Wonderland is my idea of hell (been before!). We were going to go to the Titanic exhibition but I‚Äôve now read negative reviews so don‚Äôt want to waste my money. I worked in central London for years so am fully aware of how crowded it gets at this time of year. My daughter lives in south London & works in Soho so is aware of how busy it is.  Covent Garden was lovely last year but everywhere was so busy. I used to work in the piazza so know how touristy it is. 

We are both happy to walk a fair bit. I‚Äôd like a few ideas of nice things to do & see that are not hugely expensive. I‚Äôm not averse to the museums & may end up doing that.

1oheyor,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1oheyor/asking_for_experience_with_daily_heart/,Asking for experience with daily heart palpitations,"First up, I (F/AFAB/22) know that ultimately the right thing to do is to go to a doctor. I‚Äôm not asking for a diagnosis or for opinions on whether or not I should go, I mainly just want to hear what kinds of tests or examinations were done for people with similar symptoms and whether these mild, non-life-threatening symptoms are usually taken seriously and can be helped.
I also want to mention that I haven‚Äôt had many good experiences with doctors in general.
Usually, I just end up not being diagnosed or helped at all. My mother has had similar but worse palpitation issues for years and has received no help, treatment, or diagnosis either, despite several ECGs (including a 24-hour one) and a hospital stay for palpitations and chest pain. She was told she‚Äôs ‚Äúone of the unlucky ones who notice it more than others.‚Äù Though to be fair, her lifestyle could definitely contribute to those issues.

Now, for almost two weeks I‚Äôve been having heart palpitations every day, several times a day. I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms with them. No pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. The only thing that sometimes happens is an urge to cough that I can‚Äôt suppress leading to me coughing just a single cough. I never notice them during exertion or when my heart rate is already high. Occasionally they seem related to certain movements (like crouching down or getting up), but they often happen randomly (at rest). It feels like a fluttering. Sometimes it‚Äôs just one ‚Äúflutter,‚Äù sometimes a few in a row, but never longer than about 10 seconds. When I feel my pulse while it‚Äôs happening several times, I usually felt my heart skipping a beat.

I‚Äôve had this for at least five years, possibly longer or always. It used to happen only occasionally (once every few months to a couple of times a month), but I think it‚Äôs become more frequent and a bit stronger over the past year. I have brought this up to my GP years ago too in passing and based on my description back then he said it‚Äôs normal and nothing to worry about.

I‚Äôve been very aware of my heart health this year. A few months ago, I suspected I might have mild POTS because my heart rate often jumped by 30+ bpm when standing up. I never timed how long it lasted, but sometimes, even just standing (like when brushing my teeth) would raise my heart rate to 120 until I sat down again. Since I started walking regularly for exercise, that seems to have improved or at least wasn‚Äôt noticeable anymore, so maybe it was just a fitness issue. I‚Äôve never fainted or felt faint during these spikes, just uncomfortable or a bit out of breath. 

For background:

‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt drink coffee or alcohol and don‚Äôt use drugs

‚Ä¢ I myself don‚Äôt smoke but I‚Äôve been subjected to secondhand smoking my whole life from family and now coworkers 

‚Ä¢ I mostly drink water (at least 2, sometimes up to 3 litres daily) and occasionally herbal tea

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm neither over- nor underweight

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm vegetarian, but wouldn‚Äôt call my diet healthy (mostly due to extreme pickiness)

‚Ä¢ I take 1000 I.E of Vitamin D3 daily and 1000¬µg B12 twice a week (as prescribed by a doctor once) and I drink D-Mannose Powder mixed in a glass of water every morning 

‚Ä¢ My main exercise is walking (though I haven‚Äôt done much of that the past two weeks), but I also do a little yoga every morning, though that‚Äôs mainly just sitting and stretching neck and shoulder muscles (against tension headaches I used to get a lot before starting that)

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve been more stressed and anxious lately, but I‚Äôve always had anxiety disorders (including health anxiety but I swear this issue hasn‚Äôt made me anxious, just a little annoyed and a tiny bit worried in a healthy way) and these palpitations have never flared up with prolonged period of anxiety/stress.

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs not an every day, every time kind of 
occurrence, but it certainly happens regularly enough that my vision blacks out, blinding me completely for a few seconds when I stand up 

‚Ä¢ My resting heart rate (mostly at night) can go as low as mid 50s which has freaked me out a little sometimes

‚Ä¢ Over the past 2 years I‚Äôve been very very sick with some kind of infection(s) up to 5 times that made my resting hr (despite really just lying down and not moving) stay between 100-140bmp for 8+ hours 

‚Ä¢ For the past week I‚Äôve been waking up at the exact same time every night and can barely fall back asleep after (so possibly higher cortisol at the moment?). I might‚Äôve experienced like this before, but I‚Äôm not sure

‚Ä¢ My mother‚Äôs father had some sort of heart condition that required open-heart surgery once, and my mom has high blood pressure

‚Ä¢ My own BP readings at home have always been on the lower normal side

‚Ä¢ Fitbit and Visible app readings have been off recently, as if something is up with/in my body, though that could just be the stress

‚Ä¢ I think this is really unrelated, since it wasn‚Äôt the first time this has happened either (previously unrelated to heart issues), but a few days ago, I had what I think is a migraine aura. 20 minutes of zig-zag, rainbow rave like intense flickering taking over most my vision but no headache after (which is how these episodes have always been so far, though I‚Äôve had specific food triggered migraines before, years ago)

‚Ä¢ I live in Germany.

 Hello guys. I need your advice. Me (25M) and my gf (23F) we are together for 2 years. I usually stay in her home with her parents and her sister (19F). We all pretty close each other because i stay almost 4-5 times a week on their home and i visit them in a daily basis. 

 In the last months, me and my gfs  sister  are closer, we sometimes hang out but nothing more than friendly at least from my side. Last 2 months we started tickling, fighting (not hard like playing) and teasing each other. I am noticing that her sister gets angry when she sees me and my gf kiss each other , she likes tickling me a lot, fix my nails and i caught her staring at me many times and when i see her she looks somewhere else.Sometimes when we say to go for a ride or for a coffee and she is with her friends, she says to go the 2 of us when she finish with her friends. 
 One more think is many times asks me if her outfit or her nails is good or her hair. Last thing she does is that she puts her legs on my legs just to chill. All these things are known by my gf of course except the staring. At the beginning i thought is just my future sister in law , and kinda playing but i dont know. I feel we are very close and i think she is happier with me than with her bf. Btw many times she says to me : you came here again? and i am ugly and different things to tease me.
 
I want to ask if this type of behaviour is considered a flirt or just friendly type of behaviour.

I'm new to this subreddit, I've been on my pottery journey for about two years now.   
I work on the wheel, and am a member of a community studio near me (no space at my home to craft, unfortunately). I mostly make tableware and the like, and over the last two years, my kitchen cupboards have started to strain under the weight of all the stuff I've accumulated. Fortunately, family and friends love to get pieces gifted to them, and I've already taken a bunch of coffee mugs into work - my colleagues love them.   
There are also some pieces in my cupboards that I don't really like that much, and I don't think they are good enough to gift to somebody. I think there is beauty in all steps of the learning process, and some pieces I could never get rid of even though they are not great (like my first bowls I ever made, first cup with a handle etc). But I also have quite some pieces that are just.. meh, mediocre, not great.   
What do you do with these pieces? They are definitely not good enough to sell, I would also rather not gift them, I've been thinking of giving them to the charity shop - but I'm just not sure.

I'm a young (31m) working professional. I started professional work when I was 23, as an analyst for a government military contractor. I did that for about 4 years and it was a very weird working experience that I dount I could ever get again.

I got out of that industry and moved into private sales as a data strategist. That was something I was excited about and thought I'd be super good at - lo and behold, it was insanely stressful and difficult and my coworkers were fake as hell, everything about that job stressed me out and sucked, despite a big pay increase and great benefits. I did that for about a year before I couldn't do it anymore. 

Now I'm a data engineer, but I had NO training on how to do that, so I took a pay cut and have effectively started over since getting this new job. Work here has been easy. Like really easy. I am 24/7 wfh with okay benefits and occasional travel. My pay is effectively what I made when I first started working, plus some for a single raise I got a few years ago.
I don't care about this company and their really cringe culture, but I like my boss and my senior developer co-workers. They've taught me a lot. But, my day to day is generally super empty. Like I can check emails in bed at 830-9, eventually roll out of bed at like 930 in my pj's, get coffee and start the day. My coworkers don't know that I do that, because they're usually swamped with work- work that I can't really do. I've asked them if I could help them, but a lot of the time they say that this work is beyond my capability and that I should still be learning. Which is fine. But it feels weird to be so free. I feel like if I ever lose this job I won't know how to function at any other job now. Like I'm spoiled. I've learned a lot of stuff here, but all of that came in the pretty early phases of the job, like the first year and a half. 

Right now, I'm trying to teach myself stuff on the side (like python) so that I can hopefully develop some skills to be used in the future if this job doesn't pan out. I'm a little worried that when the seniors start to retire, I'll be up s*** creek without a paddle.

I guess what I'm asking is, should I keep this job and enjoy the freedom and just work on myself in the time between tasks that require my full attention, or should I look for a job that's more active and helps me develop, or maybe a job that I really love, instead of this one that I just don't care about but have loads of free time with.",1,1761572743.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

But here‚Äôs what has happened to me so far: 

I woke up early to get some coffee at a gas station, and while I was driving the gravel roads alone in the dark, I had the lid off my coffee to help it cool off faster (dumb). The roads were smooth enough the coffee wasn‚Äôt sloshing out of the cup. I reach over and grab the coffee to take a sip and right as I did that, I hit some washboards in the gravel. The coffee splashed all over my hand, and somehow didn‚Äôt get my face. 

Then‚Ä¶ the burn sets in, and I start dropping several F bombs. My hand is a little pink, and it‚Äôs pretty tender to the touch, but nothing serious I don‚Äôt think. 

I didn‚Äôt have any water to apply on the burn, and didn‚Äôt know what else to do, so I set my coffee down and roll my window down to stick my hand out the window to help cool the burn. It surprisingly worked! 

But that‚Äôs just been the start of my day. When I made it to work, I had to open my car door, and my hand slipped, I managed to slap myself with a backhand to the cheek. 

I also accidentally slammed my big toe opening the door to work. Sure the shoe padded the contact, but I‚Äôm just sitting here at work and I‚Äôm pretty confident that I have never had as clumsy of a morning as I‚Äôm having.

I tend to ""adopt"" people.

My husband goes along with it, but he isn't naturally the most social butterfly.  This girl, K (mid 20s) used to work with me, went through a horrific cheating break up with a douche, and would come over and we helped her mend her life, moved her out, back to her parents, so she would always end up coming over to have a break from that intensity too. I wingmanned her new dating life, she met the 2nd rebound boy, we helped them move in together, painted their house with them, my husband gave them trees and plants for their back yard. My husband built her her coffee table, lent her tools for her home projects, and although struggles socially at times, he used to get on with her probably the best of many of our friends. He built her father garden boxes, her father then helped us paint our house when we needed it.. close family friendship. We'd have them over for dinner, and go out with their whole family
Years go by, she's finally getting married to 2nd rebound boy. She sends an e-vite. Sure. Just to me. I eventually call. ""Does it not include hubby?"" ""No, we talked about it, we have to keep numbers tight for the reception"". She goes on to say that they have cut almost everyone's partners who aren't the couples actual friends, and it was just necessary to do that.

And as someone who‚Äôs seen many ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù fail the test (literally), I‚Äôm here to give you the big brother lecture I wish I‚Äôd had: don‚Äôt throw your money at the first service you find.

Here‚Äôs my honest review, straight to the point, listing what matters, and tossing in some stories from my own student days so you can avoid my mistakes.

**Why Even Consider an Assignment Writing Service?**

Maybe you‚Äôre working nights, or maybe you got stuck with a history topic so dry it could start a fire. Either way, it‚Äôs not about being lazy; it‚Äôs about surviving and sometimes thriving. But you want an assignment writing service that‚Äôs reliable - one that won‚Äôt vanish or sell you a recycled essay from 2012.

So, I researched the best assignment writing services and tried them out. Here‚Äôs how they stack up:

**The Three I Tested (And Why)**

1. [leoessays.com](https://essay.watch/Xs1B7H?type=86)
2. [speedypaper.net](https://essay.watch/Rx2zjD?type=86)
3. [essaymarket.net](https://essay.watch/HkSt2T?type=86)

Why these? Heard their names more than once - and after seeing my younger cousin panic during finals, I figured I‚Äôd try to help. I checked their order process, support, and the quality of what I got.

|Service|Ordering Process|Communication|Paper Quality|Discount|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|leoessays.com|Quick, simple interface|Live chat 24/7|Clear, well-sourced|10% off new users|Great for research-heavy essays|

**What Each Top Assignment Writing Service Gets Right**

[**leoessays.com**](https://essay.watch/Xs1B7H?type=86)

* Fast sign-up, simple navigation - none of that ‚Äúregister three times‚Äù nonsense.
* The sample paper I got had strong sources, didn‚Äôt feel cookie-cutter. My old literature professor would‚Äôve sniffed out plagiarism in seconds, trust me.
* Good for: those who need deep research, not surface-level fluff.
* Discount for first-timers. Not going to name the price, but it‚Äôs competitive.

[**speedypaper.net**](https://essay.watch/Rx2zjD?type=86)

* Best for urgent assignments when you‚Äôre staring down a deadline. I tested their chat at 2am (the ghostly hour of student desperation) and got an answer right away.
* The paper met the assignment criteria, and the formatting even matched my cousin‚Äôs school requirements. I wish I‚Äôd had someone do my APA formatting back when I mixed it up with MLA.
* Discount code SP10 kicks in for new folks.

[**essaymarket.net**](https://essay.watch/HkSt2T?type=86)

* If you want something custom, this platform connects you straight to writers. I had to do that once with an impossible philosophy topic - sometimes unique voices help.
* Communication is more laid back - mostly through email, a little slower but you get a wide range of writing styles.
* Decent first-task discount. 

**Student Stories: What I Wish I Knew Then**

I remember in my second year, pulling two all-nighters for a group project because nobody wanted to touch the bibliography. If these services were around, trust me, I‚Äôd use one to check my references. But nobody tells you the best assignment writing service isn‚Äôt just about easy grades. It‚Äôs about:

* Saving time for the big stuff (like internships or actual sleep).
* Getting clean formatting and proper citations - one less thing to worry about.
* Avoiding burnout by outsourcing the grind when you know your topic but not how to structure it.
* Having a backup plan for emergencies. Because sometimes the printer breaks, or your WiFi dies.

**Tips: Picking the Right Service for You**

1. **Check response times**. If they take forever before you pay, imagine after.
2. **Look for real sample papers**. Not just reviews - actual work.
3. **Compare discounts and see what‚Äôs included.** Some throw in outlines, references, and originality reports free.
4. **Privacy matters.** Check that they don‚Äôt re-sell your work or share your info.
5. **Read policies**. Boring but important. Refund and revision terms saved me once as a student when my requirements changed last minute.

**Some Final Wisdom From Your Big Bro**

I used to joke that coffee was my assignment writing service. Honestly, times have moved on. If you‚Äôre going to use a service, do it smart. Don‚Äôt treat it as a crutch - treat it as a tool: for rough drafts, for structure help, for those times when you‚Äôre spinning your wheels and decent sleep matters more than another re-write.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to invest in something that saves time and lets you focus on what actually counts. Just promise me: don‚Äôt let it replace your own effort. And if you‚Äôre curious, all three above - [leoessays.com](https://essay.watch/Xs1B7H?type=86), [speedypaper.net](https://essay.watch/Rx2zjD?type=86), and [essaymarket.net](https://essay.watch/HkSt2T?type=86) \- passed my test. Compare their offers, see which fits your needs.

**Goals:**

* Change dorms
* Get into the Tri-Var house
* Make Dean's List

I can't believe this is happening. When I finally think I'm about to be rid of Lilith she finds a way to weasel into my dorm room. As if 18 years of pestering me weren't enough, sabotaging my perfect High School record, she is still after me. WHAT DID I EVER DO TO HER?!

I have written SO many e-mails to the housing department and they insist on ignoring me. Whatever! I will soon get her out of my hair when I move into the sorority house. The Tri-Var has everything that I need. Close to the coffeeshop and alumni godmothers with direct ties to state government. (almost) Everything going as planned.

I sat down with my idiot sister and we laid down some ground rules. We keep to ourselves, DO NOT take any of the same courses, don't acknowledge each other in the hallways and sleep on rooms that are diametrically opposed. She seems to agree. If there is one thing we can both count on is our distaste for each other. One thing consistent in this whole endeavor.

**A Transcript from Campus Radio**

*Good evening, SSU! I am Dark Lilith, a freshman and your new host to your Campus Radio. I came in to rock every little brick in these old buildings with sweet jams and power chords! Before we jump into a playlist curated straight from the depths of a back alley in Bridgeport, some quick announcements:*

*Freshmen orientation week is going full throttle and will be populated by every nerd and geek on Campus. So you can count my boyfriend to be there, so avoid giving him a wedgy as a personal favor to me. I have all the enough cool-factor for both of us in this relationship.*

*Additionally the Urele-Oresha-Cham frat house is throwing another event to welcome in the freshmen which is sure to have ALL sorts of poor-taste traditions, like hazing the robots with no personality who believe they need the approval of an outdated system to have a social standing. If you go, say hi to my dear sister for me.*

*And because it is STUPID that Greek Houses have a monopoly on Campus Social Life, I will be throwing my OWN rager at Landgraab Dorms. So if you are a fan of sick beats and human dignity, do come by. Without further ado, here is ""Moldy Bread"" a punk-rock group from across the ocean with their not-a-hit, ""Burglar Rock"".*

Goals:

College is so much harder than school. When I am done with coursework, a new assignment appears. When I am done with assignments, a second page appears in the syllabus. I am going to go crazy. Dustin asked me out for coffee, and I don't know if I even can make it. This sucks. I am pretty sure I drank every coffee on Campus.

Of course, I would have made it in time if those ANIMALS that I live with were not just throwing parties all night long. I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING! COME ON! I spend AT LEAST 78 minutes and 39 seconds each day going to and back from the library just to make time. I SWEAR TO THE PLUMBOB IN THE SKY, IF I DON'T MAKE DEAN'S LIST....

Also that llama-face Brittany Upsnott refused my pledge to Tri-Var. Who does she think she is?! I will have to find another way in. My entire life *depends* on it.

**===Comments===**

We\`re finally in University! So many new sims and possibilities to play with. Not to mention having fun with more clothes and hairstyles to give them that transition into young adulthood.  
  
While the narrative will center on our four Pleasantview Sims, some of the other households will get their own POVs. Some dynamics will change, others will be invented, relationships will reconfigure themselves. And of course, college drama.

As I mentioned in my previous post I am not from the USA so I am completely unfamiliar with the dynamics/politics of their university culture so I am working off of Hollywood tropes for inspiration. (A lot from the Tri-Var gameplay is directly inspired by Legally Blonde)

I am undecided if I will have the next POV from Dustin and Dirk, or from Tiffany Sampson. 

Speaking on the Tri-Var house I have remodeled and redecorated the house and gave the girls a makeover. I used a very famous trio of mean girls as aesthetic inspiration for them. It was great fun! ",5,1761571406.0,sims2,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs been quite some time since I‚Äôve spoken openly about this. I‚Äôve been juggling a few different communities lately, but at my core, I stay rooted in two things I love learning and food.

On one side, I‚Äôve started a small skill camp with a few students where we study Data Structures & Algorithms purely for fun and mental discipline. On the other, I‚Äôm running a small food business in a tier-2 city (Ujjain).

Over the last couple of years, I‚Äôve realized I can‚Äôt be ‚Äúpan-Indian‚Äù in cuisine. That‚Äôs too broad and chaotic. Instead, I‚Äôm focusing on Northeastern and extreme Northern cuisines, while also refining what we already do well South Indian dishes, Punjabi and Main Course dishes, pre packed lunches on the go , Sandwiches and Breakfast

Platforms like Swiggy and Zomato have been crucial to my growth they‚Äôve helped me reach more people than I could have imagined. If anyone‚Äôs ever in Ujjain or Omkareshwar, you‚Äôre most welcome to drop by or let us cater for your group. üôè

However, I‚Äôve been facing an ongoing challenge that I‚Äôm sure other food entrepreneurs can relate to:

> People ordering online just to leave false complaints.



They‚Äôll order, eat, and then claim the food was ‚Äústale‚Äù or ‚Äúbland‚Äù even when it wasn‚Äôt. Some even cancel after the food is dispatched, meaning the meal (and cost) is gone.

I‚Äôve started documenting such orders pattern-spotting the ‚Äúcrash‚Äù ones but responses from platforms remain lukewarm.

The bigger issue, though, is consumer education.
In tier-2 cities, people often have zero exposure to authentic Italian or other global cuisines. For example, I‚Äôve been trying to introduce authentic Italian pasta not the Indo-Chinese fusion most people are used to. But locals often expect ‚Äúpasta‚Äù to taste like chowmein with ketchup and chili sauce. When I serve proper aglio e olio or carbonara, they call it bland.

How do you explain ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù to an audience that‚Äôs been conditioned to think ‚Äúfusion = flavor‚Äù?

I‚Äôve kept pasta ready-made for now (testing waters), but plan to go handmade soon. Along the way, I‚Äôve added unique beverages like Panakam (said to be Lord Rama‚Äôs favorite) and our own Haatimaar Coffee a strong blend that keeps you energized for 8 hours straight.

Now here‚Äôs what I want to discuss:

I‚Äôm working with limited real estate, and I‚Äôm cautious about expanding too fast. In smaller cities, space, staffing, and consistent customer flow are real challenges.

So my question to the community is:

üëâ How did you expand your food business (or any brick-and-mortar setup) with limited physical space without compromising quality or going broke in the process?

Would love to hear insights from anyone who‚Äôs scaled efficiently in the F&B space, especially in smaller towns or cities with developing food cultures.

Thanks for reading  and if anyone‚Äôs passing through Ujjain, the first Haatimaar Coffee is on me ‚òï

Budget is $1000-$1500. I‚Äôm fine with second hand if that is better

I don‚Äôt like using plastic parts with hot liquids, so things with copper pipes & stainless steel would be best. I don‚Äôt really want to go with a combo machine. Her girlfriends have the Breville Barista Pro, but if I can do better for her that‚Äôs what I want.  

I‚Äôm fine with my basic French press setup for myself (Cuisinart DBM-8p1 & Stanley FP), but want to get her something really nice. A good fine grinder and a good machine. 

Any recommendations for learning resources would be appreciated too, I want to deliver the best coffee that I can. 

Thank you!",0,1761571132.0,espresso,2,0.5,False
1ohe6au,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1ohe6au/how_to_cope_with_a_changed_image_of_your_parents/,How to cope with a changed image of your parent(s)?,"Let's say I never connected well with my parents, especially when I was younger (I'm 41 now).  
They were too strict in comparison with other parents, too conservative and too dominant in their projections and it was impossible to talk to them on a simple, human level. Shouting was their idea of dialogue.

When I got older I attributed a lot of this to their own upbringing and outdated view of raising kids. When I finally got diagnosed with autism, other things clicked and I can safely say they're both on the spectrum - which possibly contributed to their lack of self-knowledge, empathy or self-improvement.

So I made peace with the fact they weren't the best parents around. They did their best and although I expected more, they did taught me some things about life I find useful and I grew up being not a bad human so they must have had some good influence on me.

When I was 20 I left home to be independent. I was actually sick of the tensions and expectations at home. I did want to become a teacher but I had a lot of anxiety starting with college because I've had a rocky school career and my mother told me I wasn't able to go for higher education. After 3 years of shitty jobs, I gathered little of what was left of my savings and started teacher training at college.  
I paid everything myself, while working, which was very difficult, but I got some help from friends who invited me for dinner and also my parents who gave me 1000 EUR during my 3 years of college.  
  
I still don't know how I did it but finally managed to get my teaching degree and started working.  
Ofcourse teacher pay for beginners in my country is very low for the first 5 years so I was still struggling a lot with poverty, practicing no self care at all - just working, had little to no social contacts, constant financial stress and anxiety and just feeling generally like a bigtime loser although I just managed to become a teacher.

This period in my life gave me a lot of health issues that still linger on this day. I still have financial stress, I still have this weird eating disorder, smoking addiction, low self-esteem, anxiety and an irrational fear of living on the streets.

Back to my parents:   
When I was in college and struggling, my grandfather died and my mother, her sister and her brother inherited the money from the sale of his house and another property. I never asked for any part of that money, never asked anything about it really.  
The moment she got the money, I constantly saw my mother in new dresses, they bought a new car, new furniture, went on vacation a lot...but I was happy for them, enjoying their time after working 40 years. I was sure she wouldn't spend it all at once: she was always talking to us about saving and investing and I did hear her mention something about an investment. 

Fast forward to last year: after my mother had a mild stroke 4 years before, now it was my dads turn. His stroke was so severe we had to put them both in a retirement home because independent living was out of the question. It just wasn't safe anymore.  
  
So me and my 2 brothers took over their finances to pay for the, ridiculously expensive, retirement home and to manage all the other stuff. We noticed there was hardly any money: just about 10.000.  
We asked my aunt how much they each got from the inheritance: **175.000.**

So we asked my mother what happened to the rest of the money and she started lying. *It disappeared on the stock market. Someone at the bank took it. There was this financial crash.*  
Whatever we did, she wouldn't admit she spent it all so we recovered some years of transactions and finally came to the conclusion she spent it all in 5-6 years time. Mainly on clothes, garbage, vacations, handbags, jewelry + the car and remodelling the house (which was a council house ffs). We found out she also got scammed for appr. 1000/year through some shady website in Cyprus.  
We also noticed the money was in an account in her name only. She managed the family's finances anyway: dad left all the financial business in her hands and never complained as long as there were no problems. He did say a lot about her buying so much clothes but to avoid conflict, he mostly kept his mouth shut. Which I also never expected of him.

So after an excruciating 6 months searching trip - and my dad recovering from his stroke, we found them both a place in one of the cheapest retirement homes in the region. I was devastated. First I had to discover there were no savings (while they had the chance to save a lot), then I had my own mother lie to my fucking face, then I had to deal with a severely handicapped father and finally I had to put them in a retirement home that I dreaded because of the awful care and underqualified staff.  
We had to sell all their belongings to make sure there would be enough money to pay for the cheapest option there is. I felt like the poorest guy in town.

This year, my dad died from another stroke. The funeral ate up 80% of the money that was left. Mother doesn't receive enough pension and widow-supplement to pay for her monthly costs. So me and my 2 brothers will have to step in, which is impossible for me and my younger brother: we're both living paycheck to paycheck.

I still visit her. She still expects us to visit her and take her places. She acts like she didn't do anything. After an emotional rattle of me, she finally said something like ""it was my money"".  
  
In a couple of months, the image of my mother I had, changed immensely. Okay, we never had that connection but she was still this mother figure. She gave us food and clothes and good advice.  
Now all I see is a sick, selfish woman with some kind of spending disease. And yes, I know she is sick and I know she can't actually help herself but I can't help myself either.  
Because honesty and empathy are pretty important to me, I just can't handle the fact that she   
A) spent all the money without thinking about her future, her children and grandchildren  
B) still lies about it, even when we rub the bank records in her face

I still go visit her once a week and take her for a coffee or a wine. I still go on a witch hunt every time something in the retirement home isn't up to human standards. Because that is what good sons do. But I fucking hate it. I can't believe this creature is supposed to be my mum. I can't believe I had to put her (and my dad) in a home like one where she worked all her life and had nothing good to say about it. And now I have to carry this image with me for the rest of my life without any hope on reconciliation. She still refuses to admit anything, or apologize and her health is deteriorating so she probably hasn't long to live. 

All I need from Reddit is some advice, insight or a funny meme. You can just tell me how this looks to you. You can call me a retard for still visiting her or congratulate me on being the worlds best son. I just need something. This is cheaper than therapy.  


TLDR: I found out my mom is a selfish cunt and I would've never expected this. Toughen me up stranger.",1,1761571106.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

Joya showed interest in Erin from the beginning(bringing him coffee in bed that first day) so I wasn't surprised when she chose him, and I didn't care. I wished them Goodluck and when Erin asked me to go to the secret garden with him I refused(I might replay that episode).

Both sleepover guys are just meh but if I had to choose I would choose John.

Murphy seem to have a thing for MC because he always giving us lowkey complements. I think he will be an option later on in game.

I am not affiliated with Between Two Worlds in any way, just a huge fan of The Sulphuric Secrets and in awe of all the work and research BTW has dedicated to this project.

In the image you can see the fruits of the first The Sulphuric Secrets kickstarter from last year. The novelization of Season 1, and the stretch goal, Follow The Money. The latter started as a patreon article going down the Heaven's Gate rabbit hole and ended up as a whole book. Both books came out so great, and such fun reads with all the images and illustrations. 

This year's kickstarter has already reached it's goal, but there's still a few days left to reach some of the stretch goals. I don't know about you, but I really want a calendar and the coffee table book to add to my collection. 

Don't know what I'm talking about? Go look up The Sulphuric Secrets where you get your podcasts and check it out asap. 

If you're a fan of mysteries, the occult and deep dark rabbit holes you definitely won't regret it. The amount of threads the creator is able to connect and the amount of research that goes into building this world that is balancing on the threshold between facts and fiction is just mindblowing.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Brondby IF vs. OB Odense BK: A Danish Drama of Sieves, Sugar Rushes, and Soccer**

The Danish Superliga‚Äôs OB Odense BK vs. Brondby IF clash on October 27 isn‚Äôt just a game‚Äîit‚Äôs a battle of wills between a sieve and a sugar rush. Let‚Äôs break down the numbers, news, and why Brondby is the pick to leave Odense‚Äôs defense feeling like it just forgot to lock the front door.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Bookmaker‚Äôs Favorite?

The odds tell a clear story. Brondby IF is the consensus favorite, with decimal odds ranging from **1.8 (Bovada)** to **2.0 (DraftKings)**. Converting to implied probabilities, this means bookmakers give Brondby a **50-55% chance to win**, while OB Odense BK sits at a mere **27-29%**. The draw? A paltry **26-27%**, suggesting this won‚Äôt be a game decided by a coin toss.

The spread bets back this up: Brondby is favored by **-0.5 goals** at most books, meaning they must win outright. For OB Odense, the +0.5 line is a lifeline, but let‚Äôs face it‚Äîthis is a team that‚Äôs been outscored 13-5 in their last three matches.

---

### Recent Form: Brondby‚Äôs Sugar Rush vs. OB‚Äôs Sieve

Brondby enters this match on the back of a **3-1 thrashing of Aarhus**, the league‚Äôs second-place team. Their attack is as relentless as a kid on a 10th cup of coffee, and their defense? Well, let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôre not the ones leaking goals. Midtjylland might hold the crown for most dramatic comebacks, but Brondby‚Äôs consistency is terrifying.

OB Odense, meanwhile, is a team in crisis. Last time out, they were **shut out 0-1 by Nordsjaelland**, a team that‚Äôs won just once in their last five games. To put their struggles in perspective, OB‚Äôs defense is like a colander that‚Äôs been soaked in lemon juice‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs looking for a way through. They‚Äôve conceded **15 goals in their last four matches**, including a **2-1 home loss to Viborg** (a team that‚Äôs about as intimidating as a toddler with a balloon).

Two weeks ago, the announcer started sounding‚Ä¶ off.
The voice was lower, slower. No ads, no jingles. Just a man reading the same headline over and over:

The weird part? It wasn‚Äôt foggy. The sky was clear.

Now it happens daily.
Different messages.
Sometimes it‚Äôs just breathing.
Sometimes it‚Äôs the sound of tires on wet pavement even though the road‚Äôs dry.

Last night, while driving home, I heard the announcer whisper:

I looked up. There was an exit‚Äîone I didn‚Äôt recognize. No lights, no signs, just a narrow road vanishing into trees.

This morning, the dial was stuck. It won‚Äôt change stations anymore.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KuPS Kuopio vs. SJK Sein√§joki: A Finnish Math Problem with a Winner**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‚Äòround for a soccer spectacle that sounds like it was generated by a Finnish thesaurus: **KuPS Kuopio** vs. **SJK Sein√§joki**. Two teams with names that could double as algebra equations, a title race tighter than a sauna in July, and odds so close you‚Äôd think the bookmakers just flipped a coin‚Ä¶ then double-checked it with a second opinion. Let‚Äôs unravel this like a Christmas present wrapped in riddles.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Sieves

The moneyline odds tell a story of two teams so evenly matched, even their goalkeepers probably share the same coffee brand. KuPS is the slight favorite at **+235 to +270** (decimal \~2.35-2.7), implying a **36-43% chance to win**, while SJK hovers just behind at **+265 to +270** (36-43%). The draw? A tidy **+370 to +385** (26-27%), suggesting bookmakers expect this to end like a stalemate in a chess match between two sleep-deprived grandmasters.

The spread? KuPS is a **-0.25** favorite, meaning they‚Äôre expected to ‚Äúwin‚Äù by scoring a goal while SJK either concedes or accidentally kicks the ball into their own net. The totals market? **Under 3.5 goals** is a solid bet at **-160 to -180**, because both teams have the offensive zip code of a deflated balloon.

---

### Digesting the News: Extra Math Credits for KuPS

Here‚Äôs the kicker: **KuPS has one extra match** in the remaining three to four rounds of the league season. While SJK is playing catch-up in a race where the finish line keeps moving, KuPS can afford to collect points like a toddler hoarding candy. This isn‚Äôt just a game; it‚Äôs a **strategic chess move** in a title race where ‚Äúalmost winning‚Äù isn‚Äôt good enough.

Meanwhile, SJK‚Äôs recent form reads like a Finnish fol

School is not the most important thing in life. Remember, Bs (and intentionally sometimes even Cs) give you degrees. Further, there is no shame in quitting OMSCS.

**Nobody cares about a perfect 4.0 GPA,** besides yourself.

The intention by the administrators is that **OMSCS should always be done part-time** so that you could explore things that you love and enjoy. Do not rush to graduate! Take time off, do something that you really like in the meantime, and come back stronger.

**So what if the current job market is thrashy?** Take it slow.

With a part-time program, this gives you the best of both worlds - you keep your cash flow, gain real-world experience (be it through internships, jobs, love, holiday, etc.), and let the *learning sink in*, properly. 

**We emphasise on 1 class a semester.** It's tried & tested. 

Why rush & then burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability? Mastery doesn‚Äôt come from cramming, it comes from building knowledge steadily, applying and reflecting them, and then positively and creatively reinforcing them. 

**Life‚Äôs not just a race.** Go at your pace. 

This is especially more so now when the track we are in keeps on changing. Your future self will thank yourself for it. And when all is done, post a new thread and celebrate with us.

On a Sunday morning at 9 o'clock, Sunny, a 10-year-old boy, is busy decorating his house with his family before Diwali. The living room has a big sliding window with a balcony on the east. The main entrance door is opposite to the window. A sofa set with a coffee table is kept alongside the window in the living room. Opposite the sofa, there is a Big T.V. unit.
Three carton boxes with lights and decoration items are kept over the coffee table. A basket with flowers is kept on the ground. Sunny's mother is sitting on the ground and making flower garlands. His father is standing on a stool and hanging the garland on the north side wall, and Sunny is helping his father. His Sister Naina is four years old and sits near the main door, playing with a doll.

None of this ever feels easy, but I wanted to share a small moment I had yesterday as I was out at a event. At this event they sold patches, stickers and jewlery and I came across a small patch that said I heart my solider. Its been a rough couple of months and this patch made me stop and smile and I ended up buying it
 I also got a rose patch and a dream catcher patch earlier. Sometimes its the small little things that make me stop and remember im not alone in all of this. The moment made me pause and smile because I havent really heard from him lately. But it felt like a sign from the universe in admits of all the crazy going on around the world but also within my heart. I admittedly need to find the jacket I want to iron it onto but I think im going to iron it on the inside near the lining pocket so its closer to my heart..

Cannot find the original thread so I start a new post which I will not delete it. 

I think it is a scam if the school/instructor bills block rate but doesn't have a syllabus or doesn't execute real teaching for the time they charged. For example, it is a scam 0.5 pre flight is always charged to students but CFI is always chatting with ground crew or drinking coffee. It is also scam 0.5 post flight is always charged to students but there are no debrief for the flight. I don't pay CFI to go to bathroom or drinking coffee. If you are charging me ground instructions, I need to learn something. 

I know a school charge the 3 hours block time to students as fix rate. 1.5 ground, 0.5 post flight and 1 flight time. But there is no syllabus for ground so the student is paying CFI to go to bathroom, drinking coffee, chatting with colleagues during student preflight. The post flight is just writing log book. So I think it is a scam if school/CFI operates this way.

Added text based on the replied posts

If the school/CFI charges the ground time for their supervision and/or instructions, it should be a fair game. 

But asking for block time booking and charge minimum block time rate without predetermined tasks and/or syllabus is a scam. ",0,1761569683.0,flying,16,0.27,False
1ohdmby,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohdmby,"Taco Crawl - Support Local, Eat Deliciously","I really enjoy planning and executing food crawls. It‚Äôs a great way to try a bunch of spots and see the city. I‚Äôve done dumplings and pizza so far. This time I organized a taco crawl. I searched for recommendations using Reddit, Eater, the Infatuation, and Yelp. I identified a number of spots and created the crawl. The list was originally 10 spots long but we made it to a very respectful 6 different establishments before tapping out. 

My crawls have a few general rules: tip well (typically 50% because we‚Äôre ordering so few items). I try to keep the locations walkable or within 15-20 minutes via public transportation. 

This crawl has a few specific rules:
1. One taco per person. 
2. No other food (to conserve stomach space). 
3. Corn tortillas with cilantro and onion.

We walked to every single location with the longest stretches being about 30 minutes apart. We could have taken a bus at a few places but since it was a gorgeous day, we chose to walk. The tacos we chose at each place were what was most recommended in 
the reviews. 

1. Asian Cuisine Express
First stop was a banger. Opens right at noon. You walk in and you‚Äôre like am I at a taco spot or a Chinese restaurant? When you walk in you‚Äôre greeted by a massive meat tornado sitting on their grill, charred marks galore. The staff was super friendly and they let us in a bit early. Meat was super tender, nice small size with the perfect amount of pineapple, giving you just a whisper of sweetness. There were three salsas at the table with varying levels of heat as well as pickled onions. There was an al pastor fried rice on the menu that took our collective will power not to order. 

2. Lucido‚Äôs Tacos
Bellies warmed up with one delicious taco and we were off to our second stop. About a 25 minute walk to Lucido‚Äôs for our second round of al pastor. We liked being able to compare them back to back. Both were delicious. We all agreed the meat was better at Asian cuisine express but the tortillas were superior at Lucido‚Äôs. Two kinds of salsas plus some chips and salsa. They have a unique display of masks that we admired on our way out!

3. Taquerias Atotonilco
Our third stop was about a seven minute walk and this was the busiest of the three so far! And the largest tacos. They give your table a giant bowl of pickled carrots, like absurdly giant. Like why did we get so many carrots? We all got carne asada tacos here. Solid and delicious, but not our favorite of the day. 

4. La Chaparrita Taqueria
Our fourth walk took us through a neighborhood. It was a pretty solid 25 minutes but completely worth it. This place was our favorite! Located inside a small grocery store. The atmosphere was fantastic. The service was great. We ordered the cecina and it was fabulous. The meat was sliced super thin and it was so tender. The habanero salsa was so spicy but so tasty. The server gave us a little taste of their homemade tepache and I wish I would have bought some to take home. It was so sweet and refreshing. Don‚Äôt forget to buy some little candies too! Definitely worth the trek. I would 100% come back here anytime. 

5. La Casa de Samuel
About 15 minutes to our next stop. We ordered the cochinita de pibil here. This was probably our least favorite but it was because it was kind of loud and intense. Tacos were good, not our favorite. Paloma‚Äôs were delicious and fresh! We all agreed that the tortillas were the most unique. There was live music that day and it appears all desserts are done table-side with fire, if that‚Äôs your thing. 

6. Carniceria Maribel
Our last and final stop! This one is at the back of a shop that sells some basic pantry goods and a million different types of drinks. Not a lot of seating. Carne asada here, but debated trying to shrimp. These come out super hot! Was so happy to see they had bottles of Ting so we got a couple of those too. Perfect last stop before heading home. 

This was a great Sunday afternoon activity. Overall we spent about four hours hopping from place to place. Tacos + tip and the occasional beverage came onto to roughly $8 a person per stop (reminder that we were tipping nearly 50% at every stop, so it brought our costs up). We did make one small pit stop at Buenos Days (the coffees were absolutely fantastic and super unique but they take time. We probably waited about 30 minutes for 2 specialty drinks, I wouldn‚Äôt stop here if I was in a rush). Had an absolute blast and I think I‚Äôll plan another for the spring. The four stops we skipped were: 5 Rabanitos, Carnitas Uruapan, Rubi‚Äôs Tacos, and Carnitas Don Pedro. 

For logistics: we drove and parked on 18th towards the end of the crawl. We met at Anticonquista for a coffee and took a cab to the first stop. 

When I planned this crawl initially, the uninvited presence of ICE was not what it is today. And we weren‚Äôt sure what to expect. We all said we were thrilled to be supporting businesses during this time. Since I don‚Äôt live on the community, I can‚Äôt comment on whether or not anything is different for a Sunday afternoon. It was nice seeing all the signs with information for individuals and the signs letting ICE know our thoughts about them. ",83,1761569672.0,chicagofood,6,0.98,False
1ohdm2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ohdm2w/the_first_crack/,The first crack.,"I never realized how much power a sound could have over me until recently. That crisp pssshhht when a beer opens ‚Äî that‚Äôs my trigger. For years, it‚Äôs been the soundtrack to my nights. It used to mean relaxation, reward, comfort. I‚Äôd tell myself, ‚ÄúI deserve this one.‚Äù But one always turned into more.

Lately, I‚Äôve fallen into this awful loop. I wake up every morning and tell myself, I‚Äôm not drinking today. I say it out loud sometimes, like maybe if I hear it, I‚Äôll believe it. And for most of the day, I do alright. I drink coffee, go through work, try to stay busy. But then evening comes, and it‚Äôs like something flips. The craving creeps in quiet, patient. My hands almost move on their own ‚Äî fridge door open, can in hand ‚Äî and before I even think about it, there‚Äôs that sound. Pssshhht.

And just like that, I‚Äôve broken another promise to myself. Every time it happens, I tell myself tomorrow will be different. But tomorrow always ends the same way.

Last night, though, something hit different. I caught myself opening another one without even realizing why. I wasn‚Äôt celebrating or stressed ‚Äî just running on habit. I stared at the can in my hand and realized I didn‚Äôt even want it. I just didn‚Äôt know what else to do with myself.

So this morning, I decided today would be different ‚Äî again. But maybe this time I‚Äôll mean it. No beer. No excuses.

Will I remind myself to show grace? Yes ‚Äî I have to. But after lingering here for so long, fully aware that I‚Äôve had a problem with alcohol the whole time, something has to change. Today is the day I make a real promise to myself ‚Äî to slow it down, to finally mean it when I say, I won‚Äôt drink today.

I do enjoy his vibe but I don‚Äôt want anything more than friendship.

At one point, he started to be more comfortable vs me: 
+ Touching my hair
+ Joked sth like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in love‚Äù
+ Sent me (pool) picture from his vaca, giving me winks when we cross paths outside his cabinet
+ Suggest that I can be back at his cabinet anytime even just for a coffee (idk if it‚Äôs just a politesse or not since he laughed it off directly, so I just say yes in the moment but he never actually insist or send out real invitation) etc.

When we said goodbye after sessions: from nothing, to cheek-to-cheek bises French way -> lips-to-cheek -> then a real smooche paired with a hug. Since the smooche, I‚Äôve set a small boundary to keep things clear (didn‚Äôt want it to feel inappropriate). Now he stays friendly and polite but sometimes his answers would turn cold and disengaged all of sudden.

*TLDR on the first part: I am 55, and I met a 27 year old guy, who gave me very mixed signals, and after our first date, he severely down prioritized me.*

Despite what some of the Reddit crowd advised me to do ‚Äì to forget about him and move on ‚Äì I continued a bit further. But I‚Äôm still left out in the dark about his interest in me. So, this is what has happened after my first post:

As the reply rate from his side, got prolonged and prolonged, I went all-in with one final bet and sent him a dick pic, including an invitation to come and visit me at my place. He replied almost instantly, like *‚ÄúWow, was that picture for me, really? ... But, you should know ‚Äì I liked it!‚Äù*, followed by a voice message, telling me that he was extremely tied up with work, and that has going to reply back to me when we could meet a second time.

Then, another week or so went by, and we exchanged voice messages. My replies were almost always immediate, whereas I had to wait one or two days for his. His voice sounded very joyful though, and he was giggling. And his messages were also quite long. But, after another week or so, I ran out of patience and sent him a message, asking him to be very straightforward and honest, and said that I believed that he didn‚Äôt want to see me again. Two days later, he asked if I wanted to meet for a coffee the following day. I canceled all my other plans, of course, and jumped on the bus.

So, we met for the second time, at a coffee shop. We had quite a few joyful and good conversations, although they were on very mundane and general topics. Nothing was about me or him, or about anything related to feelings or attraction. I had hoped for some intense eye contact or some attempts to touching (remark: we live in a country where it‚Äôs usually not a good idea for two men to be touching each other in a sensual/sexual way, in public). The evening ended early, and I went back to my place. After that, some sparse text messaging and voice message exchange continued.

A week later, I again sent him a voice message, inviting him to come to my place for dinner. After some additional three days, he then suddenly called me, and asked if I had any plans for that same afternoon. Of, course, I accepted to meet him. And so we did.

Another coffee shop, another couple of conversations. I tried to catch any possible moment to touch him, or to catch his gaze, but with no success. This third time, we stayed together much longer, basically having coffee, walking around in the city and visiting some tourist attractions. In the same way as at our first meeting, he outlined plans for what to do the next time we meet.

Now, I‚Äôm even more confused. **What should I do**? I believe, that if you after three dates are not attracted to the person you meet, you will never be. So, maybe the window of being able to engage into anything sexual, has closed for good.

I find him attractive. Maybe not super hot, but still with a sexy frame, a cute face and with a very joyful personality. So yes, I like him. But sexual attraction is a two way street for me. And, as being the older of the two of us, I‚Äôm very careful about making any sexual moves. The last thing I want to experience is hearing something like *‚Äúwhat the fuck are you doing, you old creep! Did you really think I was interested in you that way?‚Äù*

But speculating on his intents is not doing anything good. I‚Äôm just ambivalent about what to do myself:

* Maybe I should just confront him, and tell that I am attracted to him? In some cases however, those kinds of verbal show downs could kill the tiny amount of interest that might be there. It might also scare him away if I push him to give me some definitive answers.
* Maybe I should be bold and try to make a move in terms of clear touching and caressing, provided that there is an opportunity opening for that, in a safe way. The only risk with that, except for getting the creep label, is that I would kill any future path for friendship with him.
* Or, maybe I should just keep pretending we are meeting as friends, and let him be the fore runner.

It would be much easier, if he would come and visit me at my place. But I live in the countryside, and he doesn‚Äôt have a drivers license. And I also cannot afford to pay for those 60-70 EUR taxi rides that would be required if he can‚Äôt use public transportation, and neither can he.

It‚Äôs Day 4 around 8:44AM. I don‚Äôt know how I managed to make into work. It‚Äôs cold and dreary outside. Reddit is a comfort but also a bane, in that it can start to make your mind spiral. It almost to me feels like what hell must be like. Each and every person, in complete agony and misery, wrestling with their pain and their thoughts.

I‚Äôve made a coffee, and I am sitting at my desk. I don‚Äôt know how I will tackle the day. My now, my ex and would have texted or spoken at least four or five times.

I guess in her mind, it‚Äôs just business as usual. Who cares. Whereas, for me my world is crumbling. And of course still stuck in the unknown. Is this an official breakup. Why am I not deleted yet on any apps. Or is that just how you are, where you don‚Äôt delete on Apps.

For me I need complete closure, to know it‚Äôs over. She did this to me back in November of last year. A part of me wants to reach out, as she always says its her who reaches out to me.

However, I don‚Äôt believe I will receive the warm reception I am hoping for. I imagine it will simply be the last thing she said to me, ‚Äúthese issues aren‚Äôt fixable.‚Äù Maybe she will say she too misses me, but then again, ‚Äúwe have too many problems.‚Äù With me of course then having to defend myself, and with her denying she‚Äôs responsible for anything. Or with her doing her usual, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs me take it or leave it.‚Äù

November and December will be very depressing. In November it‚Äôs my birthday, not that I ever celebrate it. And of course then it‚Äôs Christmas.

Let‚Äôs plan your Frasier-style Christmas holiday with a mix of sophistication, wit, and just a dash of pretentious charm.

üéÅ The Frasier-Themed Christmas Holiday: ‚ÄúA Seattle Noel‚Äù

üèôÔ∏è Setting the Scene ‚Äì Your Frasier-Style Home Ambiance

Transform your space into Frasier‚Äôs Elliott Bay apartment:
	‚Ä¢	Tree: Tall, symmetrical, impeccably decorated ‚Äî think white lights, gold and silver ornaments, and tasteful ribbon, not a hint of tinsel.
	‚Ä¢	Music: Classical Christmas playlists ‚Äî Handel‚Äôs Messiah, Tchaikovsky‚Äôs Nutcracker Suite, Ella Fitzgerald‚Äôs Christmas Album, and of course, a little Bing Crosby for nostalgia.
	‚Ä¢	Fragrance: Mulled wine simmering on the stove, or a candle that smells like mahogany, bergamot, and fir.
	‚Ä¢	Cocktail Setup: A small bar cart stocked with sherry, port, and the ingredients for an excellent martini (Frasier‚Äôs choice: gin, very dry, with a twist).

üçΩÔ∏è Christmas Eve Dinner ‚Äì The Crane Brothers‚Äô Feast

Host or prepare a dinner that screams refined taste and emotional repression:
Menu idea:
	‚Ä¢	Appetizer: Oysters Rockefeller or smoked salmon crostini
	‚Ä¢	Main: Beef Wellington or herb-roasted Cornish game hens
	‚Ä¢	Side: Haricots verts almondine and truffle mashed potatoes
	‚Ä¢	Dessert: Sherry trifle or B√ªche de No√´l
	‚Ä¢	Drinks: Start with Champagne, pair the meal with a Bordeaux, end with port and Stilton cheese

üí¨ Activity idea: Have dinner music playing softly (Mozart, Schubert, or jazz piano), and read aloud something pretentious-but-festive like Dickens or a Noel Coward monologue.

‚òï Christmas Morning ‚Äì A Touch of Caf√© Nervosa
	‚Ä¢	Brew your coffee in a French press and serve in porcelain cups.
	‚Ä¢	Have a light but sophisticated breakfast: croissants, smoked salmon, fresh fruit, and maybe an espresso martini if you‚Äôre feeling Niles-level indulgent.
	‚Ä¢	Watch ‚ÄúMiracle on 34th Street‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Nutcracker‚Äù from the Pacific Northwest Ballet.

Optional: Gently critique your gifts out loud, in the most eloquent way possible. (‚ÄúAh, socks ‚Äî a metaphor for my emotional warmth.‚Äù)

üé≠ Outings ‚Äì Frasier‚Äôs Seattle Christmas Agenda

Plan some holiday activities that fit the Cranes‚Äô cultured tastes:
	1.	Attend the Seattle Symphony‚Äôs Holiday Pops at Benaroya Hall.
	2.	See a performance of The Nutcracker by the Pacific Northwest Ballet.
	3.	Visit the Fairmont Olympic Hotel for their Christmas tea ‚Äî a setting Frasier would adore.
	4.	Go wine tasting at a Woodinville winery (Ch√¢teau Ste. Michelle or DeLille Cellars).
	5.	Window shop at University Village or downtown Nordstrom, commenting on the lack of aesthetic sensibility in modern retail displays.
	6.	Drive up Queen Anne Hill for the view ‚Äî cue Frasier theme music as you admire the skyline and Space Needle lights.

üõãÔ∏è Christmas Night ‚Äì The Crane Wind-Down
	‚Ä¢	Put on your best robe and slippers.
	‚Ä¢	Sit with your dog (Eddie substitute) and sip a cognac while listening to jazz ‚Äî Duke Ellington or Mel Torm√©.
	‚Ä¢	Watch a few Frasier Christmas episodes:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúMiracle on Third or Fourth Street‚Äù (Season 1)
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúPerspectives on Christmas‚Äù (Season 5)
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHigh Holidays‚Äù (Season 11 ‚Äì the Martin and Niles ‚Äúpot brownie‚Äù episode is gold)
	‚Ä¢	End the night calling someone dear, saying something touching yet overly formal.

1ohdffs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_XtremeHeaters2025/comments/1ohdffs/what_are_xtreme_heaters/,What are Xtreme Heaters?,"Xtreme Heaters was founded in 2004 with a mission to make the best freeze protection device available.¬† From the small niche market that we originally created the product for (boating), our heaters soon found homes in RV‚Äôs, campers, well houses, outdoor valve enclosures, greenhouses, utility trucks, compressor enclosures, cars, mining and construction equipment and even military vehicles and ships.¬† There is simply no better freeze protection product on the market that is as refined, heavily tested and validated through customer experience.

As we celebrate 20 years in business, we remain committed to our core values of safety, reliability, efficiency and personalized customer service, which is now backed by the best warranty in the industry of 5 years repair or replacement with lifetime support and service.¬† The only thing that rivals our commitment to provide the best products is our commitment to our loyal customers, for which we are grateful.

  
**The Whole Story of Xtreme Heaters**  
Xtreme Heaters started as a simple idea born from a love of the water and family time. After finally buying our first big boat, we spent every weekend we could at the lake, enjoying the freedom and peace it brought us. It was during one Thanksgiving break that the vision really took shape. We were out on the lake in those crisp fall mornings, bundled up, sipping coffee, watching the sunrise, and soaking in the quiet sounds of ducks and waves in the background. It felt like the perfect escape in an otherwise busy world.  
  
But reality hit each time we had to winterize and de-winterize the boat just to get a few spontaneous trips in through the season. We did it three times that year alone‚Äîit was exhausting, impractical, and took the fun right out of it. After trying everything from unsafe personal heaters to DIY setups, it became clear that there had to be a safer, simpler way to keep the boat ready for those special moments, without the hassle. That‚Äôs when the idea for Xtreme Heaters took root.

  
  
Working at an electronics design firm, I dove headfirst into creating a heater that could keep the boat safe in the cold without needing constant attention. It sounded simple enough, but that first spark of an idea quickly turned into a long journey of late nights, prototypes, and a lot of trial and error. For over two years, I spent freezing nights out on the dock, braving the cold temps with temperature probes spread all over the boat, trying to get everything just right.  
  
Some of the discoveries were surprising‚Äîlike how temperatures could vary by as much as 20 degrees within the same engine room, all because of subtle differences in airflow and leaks from fresh air vents. Every time I thought he‚Äôd nailed it, a new challenge would pop up, leading to yet another tweak in the design. After six different versions and countless hours testing out in the cold, I finally had a heater I could trust to keep his boat safe through the winter. Those early nights on the dock taught me more than I expected, and that hands-on knowledge still drives Xtreme Heaters to build the best, most reliable products today.  
  
Every bit of knowledge from those cold, late nights has helped us build the best freeze protection solution possible. For over 20 years, we‚Äôve taken customer feedback seriously, using it to continually improve our products. When someone suggested it would be helpful to know when the heater was on, we added an LED indicator. Then we went a step further, making the LED show what the heater was actively doing. We‚Äôre problem-solvers by nature, and every piece of customer input is another chance to make our products even better. We upgrade components whenever we find a weakness, and as new technology emerges, we incorporate it to ensure our heaters are always cutting-edge.  
  
Our goal is to create a product that‚Äôs as bulletproof as possible. We don‚Äôt just test to meet the required standards; we go well beyond them to find the breaking point, and we haven‚Äôt found it yet. Xtreme Heaters is a family-owned and operated American company, and we‚Äôre proud to still be as passionate about our work as we were when we started. We‚Äôre boaters and outdoor enthusiasts designing products to meet niche needs because we love what we do. At the end of the day, our customers are our top priority. We‚Äôre here to help, to solve problems, and to make sure you get the most out of your time on the water, on the road, or wherever your adventures take you.  
  
At Xtreme Heaters, our mission is to build the safest, most reliable, and efficient freeze protection on the market. Our heaters are designed to give you peace of mind by keeping your engines and equipment safe from freeze damage, so you can enjoy more time on the water, at work, or on the road.

## ***Flight Risk pt.1***

*A Memoir*

---  

### **Prologue: Altitude and Attitude**


For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a pilot.  I don‚Äôt remember the first time I fell, but I remember the second time.

The first must‚Äôve been a garden-variety toddler tumble ‚Äî low-impact, low-stakes, maybe a scraped knee and a Band-Aid with cartoon ducks on it. But the second one? That was deliberate. That was me, age five, halfway up a decommissioned water tower with a pair of aluminum wings duct-taped to my arms and a conviction strong enough to terrify physics itself.

They say bravery is the absence of fear. That‚Äôs wrong. Bravery is the presence of stupidity wearing confidence like cologne.

I could feel the wind whipping my face, smell rust, hear my heart counting down like a cheap metronome. Below me, a crowd of about eleven people ‚Äî most of the neighborhood kids ‚Äî stared up in the kind of silence usually reserved for miracles or imminent lawsuits.

And then I jumped.

That‚Äôs the thing about dreams ‚Äî they never mention the landing.

---  

### **Chapter 1: The Sky Believer**

I grew up in a neighborhood where everyone wanted to leave, but only I planned to *ascend*. We lived under a flight path, so the sky was basically a free movie. Other kids counted cars. I counted contrails.

The third time I climbed onto the roof of our single-story ranch house with a toy plane, a thermos of Tang, and a notebook I called *Flight Log Alpha*. I‚Äôd track the planes passing overhead, copy their tails, guess their destinations. ‚ÄúThat one‚Äôs going to Paris,‚Äù I‚Äôd whisper. ‚ÄúThat one‚Äôs going home.‚Äù

Mom would yell up from the kitchen window, ‚ÄúDanny! You‚Äôre gonna fall again!‚Äù

And I‚Äôd yell back, ‚ÄúNot if I'm *oriented!*‚Äù

There was a matinee idol back then ‚Äî **Jack Elliot**. Square jaw, leather jacket, eyes like turbulence. He was everything I wasn‚Äôt: tall, calm, adored. I watched his movies so often I could quote the flight checklist by heart. When he said, *‚ÄúIf you want to fly, don‚Äôt look down,‚Äù* I took it as scripture.

I made the next set of wings out of a broken window shade and my sister‚Äôs hula hoop. It didn‚Äôt go well. In my defense, the physics textbooks I‚Äôd borrowed from the library were missing the chapters on Gravity.

The crash was legendary. I didn‚Äôt just fall ‚Äî I *orchestrated* a descent. Straight into Mrs. McKenna‚Äôs rose bushes, my elbow to this day smells faintly of Neosporin.

Mom cried. Dad laughed. The doctor said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a little touched in the head.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt care. In my own mind, I was airborne.

That‚Äôs how it always started for me ‚Äî not with talent or training or sanity, but with conviction. The kind that makes other people look at you and whisper, *poor kid.*

Years later, when I was grounded in more ways than one, I‚Äôd look back at that afternoon on the roof and realize:
that was the first time I felt gravity‚Äôs hand on my shoulder ‚Äî polite, patient, reminding me it was still the boss.

But back then? Back then, I thought gravity was a suggestion. I thought gravity was just another critic.

---  

## **Chapter 2: The Science Fair Massacre**

People talk about their ‚Äúlife defining failure‚Äù like it‚Äôs something you can sample politely, maybe nibble the edges and push the rest away.  
Mine was an all-you-can-eat buffet.

It started with the annual **Jefferson Middle School Science Expo**, otherwise known as the one day of the year when every parent pretended to understand what their kid had built.  
For weeks the gym smelled like glue sticks and ambition.
Everyone had volcanoes, potato batteries, solar ovens.
I had something better‚Äîsomething *historic*.  

I was going to build **a functional jet propulsion demonstrator** out of my mom‚Äôs vacuum cleaner, a can of lighter fluid, and the divine inspiration of *Jack Elliot*.
My project board read:  

> *‚ÄúThrust, Lift, and the Future of Personal Flight.‚Äù*  
> The subtitle, in marker and underlined twice, was *‚ÄúHumanity‚Äôs Next Step is Up.‚Äù*

My homeroom teacher, Mrs. Hollis, asked me to tone down the ‚Äúflammables.‚Äù  
I told her aviation doesn‚Äôt happen in moderation.

By the time the fair opened, my exhibit looked less like a science project and more like an *FAA investigation waiting to happen*.  
Still, I wore my grandfather‚Äôs old bomber jacket and taped aviator wings to my chest.  
When the principal cut the ribbon, I saluted the crowd.  

**Voiceover (older me):** *Every pilot remembers their first launch. I just wish mine hadn‚Äôt required the fire department.*

It was supposed to be simple: plug in the vacuum, release the lighter-fluid mist through a funnel, ignite the airflow, demonstrate ‚Äúminiature propulsion.‚Äù  
Instead, I reinvented the concept of spontaneous combustion.  
The jet nozzle shot a six-foot flame directly into the papier-m√¢ch√© solar system next to me, turning Pluto into actual dust.

For about three glorious seconds, the gymnasium became a launch pad.  
Kids screamed.  
Teachers dove behind folding tables.  
The fire alarm wailed in applause.  
And me?  
I stood there, mesmerized, watching my project *achieve lift.*

Then the sprinklers kicked in.

The crowd‚Äôs cheers‚Äîor maybe those were shrieks‚Äîmelted into the hiss of rain from the ceiling.  
My homemade engine sputtered, sparked, and died, leaving behind a crater of melted plastic and one perfectly toasted ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù banner.

When the smoke cleared, Mrs. Hollis found me holding the charred remains of my project board, grinning like an idiot.  
She said, ‚ÄúDanny, what in the world were you trying to prove?‚Äù  
I told her the truth.  
‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt trying to prove anything in the world. I was trying to leave it.‚Äù

The principal suspended me for three days.  
The local paper called it ‚ÄúMinor Blaze at School Fair; No Serious Injuries.‚Äù  
They didn‚Äôt mention my name, which somehow made it worse‚Äîlike the universe had already downgraded me to *anonymous cautionary tale.*

At home, Dad grounded me in every sense of the word.
Mom wrung her hands and said, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you just keep a bike like normal boys?‚Äù  
Because normal boys don‚Äôt dream in attitude, Mom.
Normal boys don‚Äôt hear engines when the wind blows.

That night, I lay in bed with the smell of burnt cardboard still on my clothes, watching the ceiling fan turn lazy circles.  
If you tilted your head just right, the shadows looked like propeller blades.  
I whispered to the dark, ‚ÄúJack Elliot would‚Äôve understood.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt much of a prayer, but it was the first time I ever felt the comfort of belonging‚Äîto some imagined brotherhood of reckless believers.  
People who built, burned, and built again.  
Even at twelve, I knew: you can‚Äôt have flight without fire.

---

## **Chapter 3: The Flight Crew**

When people talk about childhood friends, they make it sound like fate ‚Äî like the universe pulled a few lucky names from a hat and said *these morons belong together.*
But for me, friendship was more like assembling a crew for a doomed mission.  
We weren‚Äôt bound by destiny.  
We were just the only ones who didn‚Äôt fit anywhere else.

### **The Crew**

There was **Tony ‚ÄúRadar‚Äù Morales**, who could tell you the make and model of any airplane just by the sound of it ‚Äî and, more impressively, could burp the Morse code for SOS.  
**Marcy ‚ÄúHawk‚Äù Hill**, who was allergic to sunlight, authority, and gym class, but could outthink the math teachers by three chapters.  
And **Earl**, whose last name we never used because he‚Äôd once set his house on fire trying to ‚Äúsee if smoke goes faster in the dark.‚Äù  
He was my spirit animal.

We met in detention ‚Äî the misfit‚Äôs recruitment office.  
While everyone else doodled or glared at the clock, I leaned over and asked if anyone had ever tried to build a glider out of cafeteria trays.  
Three hands went up.  
That was it. That was the beginning of everything.

We started spending afternoons in Tony‚Äôs garage, which smelled like oil, rubber, and the lingering guilt of unsupervised minors.  
We scavenged parts from junkyards and discarded science fair leftovers.  
To us, ‚Äúfailure‚Äù was just proof we were aiming high enough.  
We called ourselves **‚ÄúThe Flight Crew‚Äù** and made ID badges out of our old library cards.  
Tony designed a logo ‚Äî a cartoon bird with bandages over its wings and a stupid grin.  
We stamped it on everything.

**Voiceover (older me):**  
*People talk about high school like it‚Äôs a runway ‚Äî you take off or you crash. For us, it was more like taxiing forever in circles, hoping someone cleared us for takeoff.*

### **The Girl Who Wasn‚Äôt Impressed**

Then came **Allison Kerr**, the underclassman.  
Pearl colored hair, long stare, the kind of smile that didn‚Äôt have time for approval.  
She joined the photography club and carried a Nikon like it was a weapon.  
I fell for her instantly ‚Äî not with fireworks, but with the slow-motion inevitability of gravity.

I tried to impress her the only way I knew how: *reckless engineering.*

During a late summer weekend, The Flight Crew decided to test our latest ‚Äúaero-vehicle‚Äù ‚Äî a Frankenstein‚Äôs kite made of PVC pipe, tarp, and misguided hope.  
We called it **The Spirit of Dover** because it sounded patriotic and doomed.

The plan was simple:

* Launch it from the top of Ridgeview Hill.  
* Catch thermals.  
* Soar majestically over the soccer field.

The reality?  
I got three feet of air before gravity reminded me who was boss.  
I landed face-first in a patch of dandelions while Allison snapped the entire sequence in rapid burst mode.  
The next day, one of those photos made the school paper.  
Caption: *‚ÄúLocal Boy Attempts Flight. Gravity Wins Again.‚Äù*

I should‚Äôve been humiliated.  
Instead, I asked her out.  
She said yes ‚Äî but not because she liked me.  
She said she was ‚Äúmorbidly curious.‚Äù  
I took it as a win.

### **Flight Lessons (Emotional and Otherwise)**

Our first date was at the county fair, under the blinking lights of the Tilt-A-Whirl.  
I told her about Jack Elliot, about how he flew the Winchester through storms without blinking.  
She told me about her father ‚Äî a commercial pilot who‚Äôd spent more time in airports than at home.  
‚ÄúHe says flying makes you free,‚Äù she said.  
‚ÄúThen why does he always look so trapped?‚Äù

It was the first time I realized that maybe flight didn‚Äôt just mean *leaving the ground.*  
Maybe it was about escaping something heavier.

**Voiceover (older me):**  
*I didn‚Äôt know it then, but every dream about flying is really a dream about not falling. The trick is, most of us are already midair.*

That summer, between broken wings and busted handlebars, I found my tribe, my first heartbreak, and the first glimpse of the sky I‚Äôd chase the rest of my life.

We didn‚Äôt have much ‚Äî no training, no funding, no clue ‚Äî but we had one another.  
And for a little while, that felt like lift.

---  

## **Chapter 4: Altitude Training**

There comes a point when every kid‚Äôs dream stops being cute and starts being a problem.  
For me, that moment was the day my father found the engine.

Not a working engine, mind you ‚Äî just a corroded hunk of steel I‚Äôd pulled from a scrapyard and lugged home in Earl's pickup like a treasure.  
It sat in the driveway, dripping rust onto my dad's newly resealed concrete, while I tried to explain how it was ‚Äúsymbolic of my future.‚Äù  
He didn‚Äôt buy it.  
Moms cry.  
Dads sigh.  
Mine growled.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seventeen,‚Äù he said, rubbing his temples like he was auditioning for sainthood.  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supposed to be thinking about college. Girls. A job. Not‚Äî whatever this is.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù I said, gesturing dramatically toward the lump of oxidized metal, ‚Äúis progress.‚Äù

He blinked twice.  
‚ÄúSon, progress doesn‚Äôt stain the driveway.‚Äù

That was my father: a man who spoke in one-liners carved from disappointment.  
He worked construction ‚Äî hard hat, lunch pail, calluses like gravel.To him, everything worth doing was measurable, heavy, and done by hand.  
Airplanes?  
Those were for rich people and dreamers.  
And he‚Äôd never much trusted either.

### **Ground Control vs. Flight Crew**

By junior year, The Flight Crew had upgraded from paper wings to something resembling a movement.  
We hosted ‚Äúopen flight nights‚Äù in Tony‚Äôs backyard, where kids came to launch whatever flying contraption they‚Äôd built from scrap wood, bicycle parts, and audacity.  
Most of them didn‚Äôt last ten seconds.  
A few didn‚Äôt last three.  
But it was community, of a sort ‚Äî a congregation of crash-test dreamers.

The school caught wind of it (literally, after one glider clipped the flagpole), and we were told to ‚Äúcease all unsanctioned aviation activities.‚Äù  
Tony framed the letter.  
Earl wanted to build a rocket in protest.  
Marcy suggested we test parachutes first.

And me?  
I doubled down.  

Because by then, flying wasn‚Äôt just an idea.  
It was an identity.  
When you grow up hearing you‚Äôre different, you start to believe it.  
But when you find something that makes you feel special instead, you cling to it like a life raft.  
Mine had wings.

**Voiceover (older me):**  
Some kids drink behind the woods, some fight, some disappear into cars or girls or music. I disappeared into air. The thinner it got, the better I breathed.  
Love in a Crosswind

Allison was patient ‚Äî for a while.  
She came to the launches, brought snacks, even helped me paint the names of our ‚Äúprototypes‚Äù across the sides of the gliders.  
But one day she asked a question I didn‚Äôt have the tools to answer.

‚ÄúDanny,‚Äù she said, sitting cross-legged on the hood of my old Buick, ‚Äúwhat are you actually running toward?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not running,‚Äù I said, without looking up from my sketches. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm flying.‚Äù  
She gave me that look ‚Äî the one that could turn any sentence into a confession.  
Then she said softly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same thing, if you never land.‚Äù

I laughed it off, because that‚Äôs what I did when things hit too close.  
But her words hung there, heavier than gravity.

### **Descent**

The fight with my father came not long after.  
He‚Äôd gotten a call from my guidance counselor, who said I‚Äôd skipped three classes to visit the airfield outside town.  
When I came home that night, smelling like jet fuel and wind, he was waiting at the kitchen table ‚Äî beer in hand, silence locked and loaded.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get you,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt. You‚Äôve got your head so far up in the clouds you can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs right in front of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs right in front of me,‚Äù I shot back.

There‚Äôs a point where every childhood dream stops being cute.  
When you‚Äôre a kid, saying *‚ÄúI want to be a pilot‚Äù* gets you stickers and smiles.  
When you‚Äôre eighteen, it gets you *concerned looks* and pamphlets about trade school.

I didn‚Äôt notice the shift right away.  
But my parents did.  

### **Ground Control (a.k.a. My Mother)**

Mom was the kind of woman who ironed her worries into her clothes.  
Always pressed, always proper, always one coffee away from collapse.  
She worked the night shift at the hospital, came home smelling like bleach and bad news, and still found time to ask if I‚Äôd ‚Äúdone something about my future.‚Äù

‚ÄúDanny,‚Äù she‚Äôd said that night, voice stretched thin as kite wire, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not *really* going to chase this flying thing forever, are you?‚Äù

I‚Äôd shrug.  
‚ÄúNot forever. Just till I get off the ground.‚Äù

She‚Äôd sigh ‚Äî that long, tired sigh that means *you‚Äôve lost me, but I love you anyway.*

Dad didn‚Äôt say much more.  
He came home, ate, watched TV, and went to bed.  
If he ever had dreams, he‚Äôd sanded them down to splinters long before I came along.  
When I told him I wanted to take flying lessons, he didn‚Äôt even look up from his plate.  
He just said, ‚ÄúGravity always wins.‚Äù

### **The Hangar of Dreams**

Tony‚Äôs uncle bought a crop-duster business and let us hang around the hangar on weekends ‚Äî as long as we didn‚Äôt touch anything with fuel or a propeller.
Naturally, we touched *everything.*

We learned to refuel a Cessna, check the flaps, clean spark plugs.  
To me, that hangar smelled like destiny ‚Äî oil, dust, and hope trying to disguise itself as competence.

One afternoon, Marcy and I sneaked into the cockpit of a retired biplane.  
She fiddled with switches. I gripped the yoke.  
The sun poured through the cracked windshield, catching the dust in the air like glitter.

‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúThis is where I belong.‚Äù

Marcy laughed. ‚ÄúBelong? You sound like a priest, man. It‚Äôs a plane, not a pew.‚Äù

But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling.  
That seat ‚Äî that small, enclosed world ‚Äî made sense in a way school and people never did.  
Everything had a name, a function, a purpose.  
When you flipped a switch, something happened.  
No guessing. No mixed signals.  
Just cause and effect.  
Heaven in a checklist.

**Voiceover (older me):**  
*Maybe that‚Äôs what drew me in ‚Äî the order of it all. The sky didn‚Äôt judge. It just obeyed physics. Down here, things obeyed everything else.*

### **The Wall**

Then the years started costing money.

Flight lessons were expensive.  
Our town barely had enough for working buses, let alone private instruction.  
I spent two summers after high school mowing lawns, cleaning gutters, and fixing anything with an instruction manual.  
By the time I saved enough for my first lesson, the local flight school had shut down.

That‚Äôs when Mom suggested college.  
And by ‚Äúsuggested,‚Äù I mean she filled out the applications herself and left them on my desk with a Post-It that said, *‚ÄúConsider stability.‚Äù*

I tried to imagine myself in a classroom, learning accounting or marketing or something that didn‚Äôt make my pulse quicken.  
I couldn‚Äôt do it.  
It felt like trying to pilot a desk.

But Allison was already looking at universities.  
Marcy had moved across the river.  
Tony was talking about joining the Air Force.  
Even Earl had discovered the high of auto mechanics and was rebuilding junkyard engines like they were holy relics.

Everyone was taking off ‚Äî just not in the direction I‚Äôd planned.

### **Turbulence**

The night I told Mom I wasn‚Äôt applying to college was the closest thing we ever had to a shouting match.  
She said I was throwing away my life; I said it was *mine* to throw.  
Dad just sat there, jaw tight, watching the argument like it was the evening news.

Finally, he said, ‚ÄúYou think flying makes you free. But it‚Äôs just another cage. A smaller one. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù

I stormed out before I could hear the rest.  
Outside, the sky was overcast, no stars, just a heavy gray that felt like the world holding its breath.

That‚Äôs when it hit me ‚Äî the terrifying, electric thought that maybe I‚Äôd already peaked.  
That the sky I worshipped was just a mirror for everything I couldn‚Äôt reach.

**Voiceover (older me):**  
*Dreams don‚Äôt die all at once. They stall ‚Äî and if you‚Äôre not careful, they take you down with them.*

That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep.  
I drove to Ridgeview Hill ‚Äî the same place I‚Äôd tried to fly years ago ‚Äî and just watched the town lights flicker like runway beacons.  
Down below, the world went on without me.  
But up there, in the dark, I could still pretend there was lift left in me somewhere.

I'm losing my mind over how to go about helping my best friend, and don't know who else to ask. Thank you to anyone who takes the time reading my story (it's long and CRAZY, you've been warned) and for any advice and your understanding. 

(TLDR: My best friend of 25 years is in a toxic relationship and I'm now worried for her and her babies' saftey, also she has some upsetting behaviour towards her sister and close friends)
SO....
She F35  has now been married for 3 years with her partner M35 of 6 years. He has been caught twice over the last 6 years texting her friends trying to flirt with them, saying he'd like to meet them. His excuses for the last two times were that he was trying to make friends, and that he has problems communicating. (he is from another country, and says that in his culture men talk to women by complimenting them, I will go into why I find this problematic later) The first time she accepted his reasons and told us that she believed him, and that we were not to question him anymore, for her sake.  Me and another girlfriend supported her choice even though we personally still had doubts, but that was her choice, and he hadn't really ""done"" anything, like cheat. 

Then last summer he did it again. she had just given birth, (after 2 years of fertility treatments) and he was texting a female acquaintance of hers who had lent her something for the newborn baby saying she's a lovely person and asking her to meet with him for coffee, that he had something he'd like to say to her. She contacted me herself, showed me the texts and told him she was not interested.  She was also shocked and confused as to why this man who seemingly is in a happy marriage on social media, and a new father would do this. This blew up , after 2 weeks of wondering how to go about this, me and  our other girlfriend told my friend, in the kindest way possible as she had literally just given birth. We almost regretted telling her because it hurt her so much. She cried for a day, then believed him again, and kind of turned on us. I almost lost my best friend. I thought I was prepared for her to get mad at us (shoot the messenger, right?) but it kind of broke our friendship up. He said that he was just trying to make friends again, and that he felt betrayed by me, calling me and Y (our other friend) home wreckers and evil, amongst other horrible things, bringing up our personal lives and problems he knew about. Saying that he was going to keep his family away from us, as we were bad influences on his wife. (At this point we are wondering what he's been getting away with behind her back for years, if he's trying to flirt with women we all know) 
My best friend told me that I was trying to accuse her husband without real proof, and that I didn't think of her feelings, that I made her think that her husband was a bad person, that she has a family now that she needs to take care of. This hurt me so much, as I'd taken a plane trip and time off work back to our hometown to support her and also not to tell her over the phone about his behaviour, also , to be there in person if she needed a shoulder to cry on. 
She was obviously not ready to see the truth, I get it. She has always had attachment issues with her partners, and I believe he is playing with her. 
This was already painful enough. I told myself I was going to take a break from her private life for a while, as I felt like I'd intruded too much, and did not enjoy receiving hateful voice messages from both my best friend and her husband. I thought I'd just keep the conversations short and light. Let both of us  breathe and let some time pass. He then blocked me on everything. She is like a sister to me and I want to let her enjoy life, whichever one  she choses. We were slowly starting to feel normal again. 

Only 4 months after her OWN SISTER called her in shock. He had been texting her for over a week with more, explicit and vulgar wording. It started like the other two women, saying how much he appreciates her, then it goes to ""you're really beautiful"" then saying he'd like to meet up privately because he has something to tell her in secret. Just like the last two times. Only this time, her sister thought it was impossible that he was flirting and thought he had a surprise for his wife maybe, she answered nicely something along the lines of :  ""ok we can meet, just tell me what is up?"" 
So he went from ""you're a beautiful person"" to saying that he's always found her sexy and that he'd ""always wanted to ""fu‚Ç¨k"" her since the first time he saw her"" . Shocked, she answered that she didn't recognise him, that he was in the wrong for saying this, to which he then threatened her with sending her videos of himself m@$sturb@ting over her pictures if she didn't delete the messages or if she told anyone. (I will also add that my best friend hadn't told her sister about the last two times, probably out of embarrassment I guess. Even if they are close and her sister would spent time in the house with them and the baby. We also are wondering what she doesn't tell us? maybe she is keeping things from us so as not to give us ammunition to convince her to leave.) 
She ran to her sister, and told her, obviously. 
I am so upset again. She believes him. His excuse this time? He is possessed by an evil spirit, he doesn't remember sending those texts. (I kid you not) He's saying that he feels like he is loosing his mind, under stress from the newborn, and needs therapy. So she has sent him to her therapist. Her therapist has told her that he seems fine and a nice man (her ""therapist"" is a gestalt therapy counsellor, who I personally think has no business getting involved in my friends' personal life if she has been going to him for years) She is saying that she plans on staying with him, as he is obviously going through a mental crisis. And that once he has gone to therapy, they will go to couple's therapy and work things out. He is playing victim again. I am so angry and terrified of who my friend is with, and of what she is willing to accept out of her own fear of being alone. 
He basically sexually harassed her sister. She wants to ""cure"" him. I feel like I'm going crazy. I can't lash out, I can't shout at him. I don't want to , but I desperately do. It's such a confusing feeling. I'm angry at her for allowing this man to do this, for accepting this, for betraying herself and her sister. There is another issue that makes me uncomfortable - he is from West Africa, and she is European . He likes to say he comes from a different culture and there are things that she doesn't understand, and vice versa. That he tries to communicate but things get lost in translation. She says that he is trying to express his feelings but can't, and he keeps everything inside and that is what makes him expIode and do crazy things. She has found an ""Ethno psychologist"" who will supposedly help them move forward . I find that there is a racist undertone to all of this. People come from different backgrounds, have different cultures, but using them to play into stereotypes, also to infantilise and excuse your partner of his bad behaviour is wrong. It plays into the assumption that Africans are less capable of understanding concepts around relationships, faithfulness and love and it allows her to validate his behaviour.  (For the record I'm mixed race myself) I find this infuriating and frankly quiet racist. My friend asked me over the phone what my opinion was, to which I could only say she knows what my opinion is on her husband and last time she asked she didn't like the answer to the point of us almost not talking anymore. I just said that I think she needs to be careful, and stay safe, that whether he has psychological issues or not, what he did was unacceptable. 
 I feel  I'm at the end of our relationship? I don't know how to support this anymore. Our other girlfriends who know the situation are more understanding, saying at the end of the day she is the one in the most danger, who is obviously stuck in an extremely abusive relationship. They are trying not to push her too much, or say too much to her so as not to let him isolate her even more. If her own sister can understand her and forgive her for allowing her husband to do this to her, surely I should? 
I just keep thinking that he could do anything to anyone and she would find anyway that suits her to justify it. What's next, he'll get caught upskirting and say the ""night spirit"" forced him to do it? And then she'll say it's in his culture and she needs to try to understand? (He literally called the evil spirit the ""night woman"" . I know there is also a ridiculous side to this terrifying story) . My friend is a very intelligent, smart, funny, open minded feminist. Which makes this whole ordeal sadder.  She has travelled the world, she speaks many languages , she has so much more to give to someone who is obviously taking her for a ride. She has given him a job, papers, and now, a child. Also he has been here for 10 years, he speaks perfectly her language and has a stable job working in her extended families' business. He is Muslim, she is an atheist but that hasn't stopped her from getting the baby an islamic baptism, and allowing her baby to be raised under her husbands' religion. She is vegetarian, he eats meat, she is cooking meat for both him and the baby. ( I say this only to highlight her putting aside her own beliefs for him and her own baby,  no problem whatsoever with people who are of any religions, at this point why not convert, at least that would make sense.)  
If you've read up to here, Thank you so much. I maybe just needed to get it off my chest. Clear my thoughts .I don't know. Any advice would be appreciated.

I use a pressure of 15 and on my air sense 11 all my numbers check out very well. Usually under 2 ahi nightly. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much coffee or energy drinks I intake I‚Äôll still fall asleep if I get the chance.

I‚Äôve been through 3 different masks now over the years. Starting with nose pillows to a full face mask alternative to now a full face mask and I still don‚Äôt have any relief. I feel like a walking zombie of some sort some days.

My data gets sent off nightly to a sleep clinic and I haven‚Äôt got any calls or messages for a checkup in probably a year +

1ohdc3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceTalks/comments/1ohdc3c/i_decided_to_invest_6_a_day_instead_of_spending/,I decided to invest $6 a day instead of spending it. Here‚Äôs what actually happened after a year,"We‚Äôve all heard the classic personal finance advice: ‚ÄúSkip your daily coffee, invest the money instead, and you‚Äôll retire a millionaire.‚Äù

It always sounded like something people say just to make a point. I like my coffee, and honestly, five or six bucks doesn‚Äôt feel like it would change much. But after hearing it so many times, I decided to test it for myself. For one full year, I invested $6 a day,  roughly what I spend at Starbucks, just to see if it actually makes a difference.

I didn‚Äôt want to overthink it. I used Fidelity, but you could use any low-fee broker that offers fractional shares and automatic investing.

The main things I looked for were:

* Low or no account fees
* Fractional share investing (so I could literally put in $6 at a time)
* Auto-invest features
* A tax-advantaged account

I opened a Roth IRA, since contributions grow tax-free over time. For the investment itself, I went with a Vanguard S&P 500 index fund (VFIAX equivalent) ‚Äî basically, a simple basket of large U.S. companies that automatically reinvests dividends. No stock picking, no chasing trends.

I automated everything. Every morning, $6 automatically moved into my Roth IRA and went into the index fund.

This is called dollar-cost averaging ‚Äî investing the same amount regularly no matter what the market‚Äôs doing. When prices are high, you buy fewer shares. When prices are low, you buy more. It smooths out your cost over time.

My one rule: don‚Äôt skip a single day, no matter what.

**What happened**

I started in September 2023, and for the first few months, it honestly felt like nothing was happening. Some weeks the balance went up, some weeks it dropped, and I just ignored it.

Here‚Äôs roughly how it played out:

|Month|Gain/Loss|Return %|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1st month|\+$9.80|\+0.6%|
|3rd month|\-$17.50|\-1.1%|
|6 months|\+$142|\+5.3%|
|12 months|\+$398|\+14.6%|

By the one-year mark:

* Total invested: $2,190
* Account value: $2,588
* Profit: $398

Nothing wild, but still better than I expected for something that required literally zero effort.

Now, 14‚Äì15% returns in a year aren‚Äôt typical, 2024 was a strong year for the market, but the takeaway was clear: consistent, boring investing actually works.

**What I learned**

**‚ÄúTime in the market‚Äù really is the key.**

If I had tried to time my entries or waited for a ‚Äúdip,‚Äù I probably would‚Äôve messed it up. Just staying invested worked fine.

**Automation is everything.**

The reason I stuck with it was because I didn‚Äôt have to think about it. If I‚Äôd had to manually transfer money every day, I‚Äôd have quit halfway through.

**Small doesn‚Äôt mean meaningless.**

$6 a day feels like nothing. But that‚Äôs over $2,000 a year. At an average 9‚Äì10% annual return, that grows to roughly $380,000 in 30 years, from coffee money.

This experiment convinced me that the ‚Äúskip your coffee‚Äù advice isn‚Äôt really about coffee. It‚Äôs about building a habit.

If you can teach yourself to consistently invest small amounts, no matter how insignificant they seem, you‚Äôre setting yourself up for long-term success.

I still drink my coffee. But I also invest $6 a day, and that tiny change has completely shifted how I think about money.",28,1761568918.0,PersonalFinanceTalks,1,0.97,False

I had a colonoscopy 12-13 years ago, (bright red blood in stool). Same reason I am having another one. First one, was just told I had a beautiful colon. Hoping I get told the same. I honestly do not remember much, but I assume the prep was rough, as it was the really nasty stuff.

I started seeing bright red blood on my stool 7-8 months ago - I had a bit of constipation, so I assumed a hemorrhoid, or fissure, but it's been off and on for many months, so I decided to bite the bullet and get this done to be safe.

I am just extremely nervous - I hate the thought of this procedure. I hate that I cannot drive myself. It just feels very undignified. I know the risk of the alternative is much worse though.

I made myself some homemade bone broth with some beef bones I had stored, that I let simmer for 24 hours. Also, thankful I am allowed plain coffee, but tomorrow morning will be rough I expect, with a good headache from caffeine withdraw. So, for today it is a bone broth, coffee and water day. Tomorrow I'm supposed to just drink a 32 ounce of Gatorade with another bottle of Miralax. I wish there was a better alternative, because I never drink sugary drinks - but I do not want risk the prep and not follow their instructions.

**Please note: photos attached to this post are of Tianmen Mountain. I hope these photos will give people a better idea of what to expect ‚Äì what they will see or could see (pending weather and time of the year); help people plan a suitable itinerary or to navigate around Tianmen Mountain ‚Äì without a guide.**


**DAY 5**

I met my guide at Luckin Coffee around 8:30am so I could grab a cup of Iced Rose Latte (yum!) then walked across the street to the **Tianmen Mountain Cable Car Entrance (see photo 1 attached).** My guide had already booked a timeslot for us to enter (I believe its okay if you enter within 30min of the time-slot) and we completed Line A ‚Äì where you walk down the 999 stairs at the end. While I had to get my passport scanned to enter, my guide went through a different line and we met up in the queue for the cable car. It‚Äôs a long 20min+ ride up and the views were amazing as you can see Zhangjiajie city, mountains, valleys, the 99 bends and Heaven‚Äôs Gate ‚Äì on an angle (see photo 2 & 3 attached), as you head up to the top.**

Once we got off the cable car at the **Upper Station of Grand Cableway**, my guide lead me onto an escalator to **Yunmengxian Peak / Yunmeng Fairy Peak tower, which is the highest point of Tianmen Mountain**. It was quite cloudy up here, so we couldn‚Äôt see very far into the distance but on a clear day, you would get wonderful 360 degrees panoramic views of the entire area up here. **You can also pay to use the chair-lift (with no hand railing bar to stop you from falling off, so its sorta dangerous) from Yunmengxian Peak to Tianmen Mountain Temple.** I didn‚Äôt use the chair-lift as we would then have to do a round-trip or back-track to visit the other places that were on my list. After about 30min here, we caught the escalator back down to the Upper Cable Car Station area and headed to the **Heaven-Approaching Platform** then to the **West Glass Skywalk**.

**At the West Glass Skywalk, you pay 5 yuan (maybe 10 yuan?) for a pair of red slippers to wear over your shoes so you can walk on the glass and admire the views (see photo 4 & 5 attached). It‚Äôs short ‚Äì maybe 15min stroll, but depends on how crowded it is and your fear of heights. Nevertheless, its worth doing! Note: There is also the East Glass Skywalk, which is located on the other side of the mountain but my guide said the views aren‚Äôt as good as the West Glass Skywalk.** Once you complete this, you return the red slippers and end up at **Rainbow Pass** lookout point. If you don‚Äôt want to do the West Glass Skywalk, you can bypass it and walk through a different footpath which will lead you to Rainbow Pass. From Rainbow Pass, there‚Äôs only one walkway to follow and it will take you to **Forest of Wishes ‚Äì where you can buy red ribbons and/or wooden plaques, write your name or a message on them, then make a wish and hang them around here (see photo 6 attached) ‚Äì its like at the World‚Äôs No. 1 Bridge on Avatar Mountains)**.

After I hanged my red ribbon and wooden plaque on a tree, we continued strolling along to the **Guigu Moat** (see photo 7 attached) which was incredible! How these concrete walkways were built really amazes me... I felt like I was hiking around the mountain without actually climbing, huffing and puffing out of breath! It‚Äôs very safe and I bet you‚Äôll stopping every 5 metres to take another photo of the views! One of the best areas is along the **South Guigu Walkway** - its so surreal here as you can see how big the mountain is and how small we humans are on the walkway (see photo 8 & 9 attached). When you reach the **wide wooden suspension bridge**, make sure you stop for a moment and turn around to see Yunmengxian Peak (see photo 10 attached), then continue to the **Viewing Platform of Guigu Cave, Beihe Wall** (see photo 11 attached, this is around that area), and **Son-Craving Cave, til you reach Tianmen Mountain Temple (see photo 12 attached, a map guide of how much the temple is).** I arrived here around 11:15am and spent nearly 1hr exploring all the halls, stopped by the one souvenir shop and visited a small exhibition in the last building (no photos allowed up here on the 2nd floor).

A few minutes walk from the Tianmen Mountain Temple, is a resting area with souvenir shops, cafes & restaurants ‚Äì not many. I had lunch at 12:30pm in the **Cherry Bay Restaurant**, 45 yuan for some stir-fried beef and vegetables with rice ‚Äì very tasty! Around here, you can also catch the chair-lift to Yunmengxian Peak (see photo 13 attached).

We made our way to the **Love between Tree & Rock** viewing point, then to **Cliffside Path, Tianmen Cave Reservoirs** (where the East Glass Skywalk is located), **Immortal Source, Buckling Pass, Intoxicating Cloud Pavilion and Jade Lock of the Stone Door** (which isn‚Äôt on any map?) - but its a great area to visit as you will see the back end of Heaven‚Äôs Gate: the other side of the hole without the 999 stairs (see photo 14 attached)... then to **Fairy Springs** (which isn‚Äôt on any map?) and detoured to **Lingquan Temple**. There‚Äôs some construction work happening here, so not a lot to see but there was a toilet block, which we needed! My guide said, not many people visit this area of Tianmen Mountain as most are on a strict time frame, they‚Äôre tired from exploring the other areas already or only wanted to visit the main attractions; but I was fine ‚Äì I still had plenty of energy and I really wanted to see it all. We left the little temple around 1:40pm and made it to **Yuhu Peak tower** by 2pm.

I highly recommend visiting Yuhu Tower as you will get a gorgeous view looking down into the valley (see photo 15 attached), and you can see Yunmengxian Peak and the crazy cliff walkways (see photo 16 attached). As you make your way to the **Tianmen Cave North Watching Site**, you will pass the **Transmountain Escalator** and reach an area with restaurants, cafes, a few street vendors and a toilet block. There are lots of benches to sit and eat around here, rest and relax. I had a sea-salt cheese soft-serve ice cream cone for 15 yuan then wandered over to the platform area to view the Heaven‚Äôs Gate with the 999 stairs (see photo 17 attached). From here, you can walk to the **Fairyland Corridor, Panlong Cliff Glass Walkway, Davidia Involucrata Flower Garden, and Suspending Bridge of the Divine Valley which will lead you back to Upper Station Grand Cableway, but we caught the Transmountain Escalator down to the Heaven‚Äôs Gate instead.** If I ever come back to Tianmen Mountain, I will do this part - I didn‚Äôt have time to on this visit.

It probably takes 10min+ to ride all 5 or 6 escalators down, depending on how crowded it is, the queues etc. I didn‚Äôt wait at all to get on the escalators around 3pm. Once you reach Heaven‚Äôs Gate, it is packed. Lots of people are hanging around here trying to take a photo with the hole which has a pool at the base (see photo 19 attached). My guide said, its to help protect people and the cave because if a rock falls from above, ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù it will land in the pool and there will be less noise/echo, disruption‚Ä¶ On the left side of Heaven‚Äôs Gate, you will see a plaque and statue of a man who climbed the cave mountain here with no equipment ‚Äì what a lucky man to be remembered here! Now, **walking down the 999 stairs was an interesting experience! I wear shoes womens size US 8 / 39 or mens UK 6 / 39 and I couldn‚Äôt put my feet straight flat on a stair step. I had to place my foot on a 45 degrees angle to get my whole foot on a step. I‚Äôm noting this, because if you have really big feet, you might have trouble walking up / down these stairs or it might be uncomfortable. My heel kept touching the back stair step as I made my way down. I took my time, held onto the handrails and stopped every 20 steps to take photos, look around, wait for the person in front of me to move! There‚Äôs 5 sections to the 999 stairs and the middle row was busiest as everyone wanted to take central photos of the staircase and Heaven‚Äôs Gate.**

I reached the bottom of the 999 stairs around 3:45pm. There‚Äôs a stall selling incense, red ribbons and wooden plaques for 20 yuan (package deal) and you can pray here and place the incense in the big cauldron and hang the ribbons and plaques on it. **At the base of the 999 stairs, is a massive concrete square area with a few cafes, restaurants, souvenir shops, toilets and a viewing platform to look down at the 99 bends. You need to walk past all this to reach the Upper Station of Tianmen Cave Expressway cable car to head down the mountain. Once you‚Äôre inside the cable car, make sure you look to the right-hand side (and backwards, depending which side your sitting and facing) to see a huge set of stairs on the mountain (see last photo attached). I think this is interesting to note because I‚Äôm assuming, if the cable cars are broken / not operating, you will need to climb down these ‚Äòemergency stairs‚Äô to the bottom of the mountain?! Yikes!**

Around 4:30pm, I caught the 10min+ cable car ride from the Upper Station of Tianmen Cave Expressway to the **Mountain Gate**, which is also where you watch the Fox Fairy show. You follow the crowd and walk through a huge corridor, down lots of stairs, pass the Fox Fairy Show outdoor stage on your left-hand side (stop and watch the big animated white foxes on the rooftops for a few min ‚Äì they snore, open their eyes then go back to sleep ‚Äì so cute and a lovely surprise!), then stroll into a huge car-park before joining the queue to get onto a 20min shuttle bus, pending traffic, which will take you back to the **Tianmen Mountain Cable Car Entrance** in the city (see photo 1 attached). I got on the shuttle bus around 5pm and was back to Luckin Coffee where my guide dropped me off before 5:30pm.

**If you‚Äôve read all this, as you can see, it takes a full day to really explore Tianmen Mountain and I didn‚Äôt visit a section. I would have needed another hr or so and would have to back-track through it again to go on the escalator down to the 999 stairs. What you will see on Tianmen Mountain will depend on which Line A ‚Äì B or C you choose and whether you detour off the main route to check out various lookout points. Hence, I highly recommend you allocate a full day, 8am to 6pm, for Tianmen Mountain. People who only have half a day to visit Tianmen Mountain, won‚Äôt be able to check out the temples, go on the glass walkways, drop by Yunmengxian Peak tower and Yuhu Peak tower for panoramic views of the area, have lunch, relax at various lookout points etc. I think, if you have travelled all the way here, you should make the time to see it all ‚Äì as much as possible. Ask yourself, when will you return to Zhangjiajie?**

So, did I really enjoy my visit to Tianmen Mountain? Yes!

Would I revisit Tianmen Mountain? Yes, maybe in 10 years‚Ä¶ It was one of my favourite days on this trip to China!

After a quick bite and shower, I hopped into a taxi ‚Äì not a DiDi, to **72 Qilou / Wonder Tower**. I booked my entry ticket on Trip.com while I was in the taxi and arrived before 8pm. **You can have dinner here ‚Äì outside of 72 Qilou, or inside 72 Qilou. There‚Äôs about a dozen places to choose from outside = McDonalds, Meet Fresh, restaurants, cafes, convenience stores if you want something light etc, and only Chinese restaurants or cafes inside.** Once you‚Äôve scanned the qr code ticket to enter 72 Qilou, you can watch all the shows you want: like 10min street skit performances, musical broadway type acts, traditional dancing, there‚Äôs a bonfire dance party later at night‚Ä¶ 72 Qilou has a ground street level and first level (theres stairs and escalators to go up / down), its like an outdoor plaza with a theatre, entertainment areas, souvenirs shops, an arcade, several small museums ‚Äì enough to entertain you for a few hours. 72 Qilou closes at 11pm. The lights on the tower was probably the highlight for me ‚Äì it changes colour, from yellow to red to green to blue etc. A lot of people think this is a tourist trap attraction. I think, its just a place to hang out and something to do at night. Its a change of scenery, literally, from the national parks ‚Äì mountains, trees, rivers, canyons etc. Consider the entry fee as your contribution to staff wages, the cleaning and maintenance of the premises. It‚Äôs not expensive and if you have time or want something to do at night, visit 72 Qilou.


Thanks for reading all this. I hope its useful..


I will post my Trip Report on Furong, Fenghuang and Wangxiangu soon‚Ä¶

My husband and I are considering moving to Sheridan Park from Wicker Park. Currently we live on a busy street and we are looking for more of a neighborhood feel. We love design, being able to walk to cafes, being a close walk (or drive) to grocery stores/the gym. We got married last month so the next place we live is where we will hopefully have our first child if we are lucky.

We love the vintage charm of the buildings in Sheridan Park and have spoken to several people on the street and via phone who have lived there for multiple years. All have said that they love living in Sheridan Park, but because we are not familiar with the area we figured we'd post here to collect more info. For anyone who lives there: 1. Do you feel safe? Would this be a good area to have a baby in?, 2. Where do you find yourself going for groceries/dinner/drinks/coffee?, 3.

1ohd6yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppBusiness/comments/1ohd6yo/how_to_create_pixel_art_answers_to_questions/,How to Create Pixel Art: Answers to Questions Beginners Actually Ask,"Pixel art looks simple‚Äîjust tiny squares on a screen. But when you try making it yourself? It suddenly feels like a puzzle no one gave you the instructions for. If that sounds familiar, you‚Äôre in the right place.

And yes, you can start even if you‚Äôve never drawn anything before. One of the easiest ways to experiment is by using the [pixel art maker](https://www.filereadynow.com/productivity-tools/pixel-art-creator) feature to turn a photo into pixel art and edit it manually from there.

Let‚Äôs solve the questions most beginners ask.

# 1. How Do I Start Making Pixel Art If I‚Äôm a Complete Beginner?

Start small‚Äîreally small.  
Don‚Äôt try to create a full landscape or video game scene on day one.

**Here‚Äôs an easy first step:**

1. Choose a tiny canvas: 16√ó16 or 32√ó32 pixels.
2. Pick only 5‚Äì6 colors.
3. Draw something simple: a heart, a tree, a cloud, your initials.

Why? Limiting size and colors helps you focus on shape and shading instead of getting overwhelmed by details.

# 2. What Tools Should I Use for Pixel Art?

You don‚Äôt need expensive software. These are popular and beginner-friendly:

|Tool|Best For|
|:-|:-|
|[FileReadyNow](https://www.filereadynow.com/) (free, browser)|Professional pixel art + animation|
|[Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) (free, browser)|Simple, clean, great for beginners|
|[Procreate](https://procreate.com/) (iPad)|Drawing + pixel brush support|
|[Photo to Pixel tools](https://pixelartvillage.com/)|Quick conversion from photos to pixel art|

# 3. How Do I Turn a Photo Into Pixel Art?

This is one of the most common questions, and it‚Äôs easier than you think.

**Basic method:**

1. Upload a photo into a pixel art tool.
2. Choose pixel size or resolution (like 64√ó64).
3. Reduce colors if possible.
4. Manually fix edges, shadows, and highlights square by square.

You‚Äôll still need to clean it up yourself. Automatic tools get you 50% there, your creativity finishes the rest.

# 4. What Are Some Easy Pixel Art Ideas?

Here are simple pixel art ideas that don‚Äôt require advanced skills:

# Beginner-Friendly

* Small house with a red roof
* Sun, clouds, or a moon with stars
* Simple food icons like pizza, coffee mug, or sushi

# Photo to Pixel Art Ideas

* Your pet or favorite animal
* A skyline from your city
* A selfie, reduced to 32√ó32 pixels

# Mini Scenery Ideas

* Mountain at sunset with a gradient sky
* Snowy cabin in the woods
* Beach scene with waves and palm trees

Start with one. Keep it messy. You can make it prettier later.

# 5. What Makes Pixel Art Look Professional?

Here‚Äôs where beginners get stuck. To level up:

* **Use shading, not outlines.** Shadows shouldn‚Äôt be black, use darker versions of the base color.
* **Add light direction.** Decide where your ‚Äúsun‚Äù or light is coming from.
* **Avoid too many colors.** Great pixel art often sticks to 8‚Äì16 colors total.
* **Zoom out often.** Pixel art is meant to be viewed from a distance, not at 500% zoom.

# 6. Where Can I See Good Pixel Art Examples for Inspiration?

Look at:

* Classic games: Stardew Valley, Celeste, Pok√©mon
* Instagram / Pinterest: search ‚Äúpixel art ideas‚Äù or ‚Äúpixel artists‚Äù
* Game dev platforms like [itch.io](http://itch.io) or Behance

Study how artists use color, shadow, and simplicity, not just how detailed things look.

# Final Thought

Pixel art isn‚Äôt about perfection, it‚Äôs about storytelling, patience, and learning to see beauty in small squares. Start with one idea. Keep your canvas tiny. And don‚Äôt worry if your first attempt looks like a potato, it‚Äôs part of the charm.",1,1761568513.0,AppBusiness,0,1.0,False

My husband and I have been married for 6 years and I absolutely love him as a person. He's resilient, funny, loving, very smart, successful career-wise, mostly reliable, still very attractive to me. I'd say we're happily married 85% of the time. 

He has an issue though, a big one: explosive anger. Our first year of marriage he didn't like my messy desk so one day when I was at work, he got rid of my entire office and turned it into a TV den, which was very violating. My mom gave us a coffee table that I liked and he didn't and we were debating what to do about it and then one day when I was at work he brought it to the GoodWill. Then there's been other times where his anger explodes and he breaks things. One time he shredded one of my books that was a gift from a friend, he has called me a fucking idiot multiple times, smashed his own glasses on the floor, punched a wall, stomped on our kids toys, broke them and smashed their favorite wooden barn (because my 5 year old daughters room wasn't clean) in front of all of us, swerved all over the lane of a highway (with no one else on the road) and threatened to throw his Bible through the car when I ""asked him to drive with at least one hand on the wheel with me and the kids in the car"" (he was driving with no hands on the wheel with lane assist) because I had nagged him a few too many times that day. There's more instances of pretty egregious things throughout our marriage similar or slightly worse than these stories. He's never touched me or the kids in physical aggression, but he's not really seeking help for his issues with explosive anger either. 

I don't want our sons to see this, I don't want our daughter to grow up seeing this. Arguing is one thing but this physical aggression outbursts that happen maybe 4 times a year are already too much. They're really becoming a dealbreaker for me. Can I be honest in couples therapy about this with him? He'll be embarrassed, but he is not facing this problem. And Im the one contacting therapists for all of it, which is also frustrating because he is not taking the initiative to get help at all. I'm starting to consider getting a divorce because of it because I dont want my kids learning this behavior. I don't know what else to do because it's not getting solved.

Im a contractor and recently, weve had more jobs down in the city, so thats where ive been commuting to on the bus.

Ive had a few counter protesters recodnize me while commuting, most just dont say anything and i continue to mind my own business, but theres a few thst i keep running into that keep making a scene and have no respect and dont differentiate commuting to work, in construction orange, steel boots on and a tool bag with me, from protesting. 

The 3 worst i keep running into get right up in my face, scream all the ists and isims at me, theyve dumped my coffee all over me, spat at me, kicked and punched, stolen non political hats right off my head so on. No provocation, usually when i run into them im watching reels on the bus or walking along drinking my coffee eating my donut, other than they are regulars at the protests and recodnize me as a regular from the other side. 

Rather ironically, 3 things that regularly appear on my signs, End Political Violence, Reform *City name* Police Service and calls for Bail reform to take away bail from repeat violent offenders. Every incident of assault by these 3 gets reported, but hardly anything is done about it. Theres been a few times i see them go into cuffs, but then a few days later i see them again. 

Its got so bad that i never take the same route 2 days in a row and never take the same route home as i did to get there, ive been attacked and beaten to hospitalization after i fought back by what i still believe to be the minority of antifa members that are cool with violence, before at a protest, not trying to do it again with nobody i know around to help if more show up and decide to do something. 

Either way, the bullying and harassment wont stop me from protesting for what i believe in, if anything its making me double down on it. Like i said, i still believe its only a small minority of antifa freaks that do violent shit like this, but that small minority isnt helping yalls cause, and i hope you can reign them in, as we should on the right with folks who act simmilarly. We should be able to disagree at a protest, but also be able to peacefully coexist free from harassment and assault.

1ohd3gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreaticcancer/comments/1ohd3gw/72m_stage_45_pancreatic_cancer_journey/,72m Stage 4/5 Pancreatic Cancer Journey,"Sharing a little of my father's journey, I'm somewhat despair after getting to know how deadly pancreatic cancer can be, aggressive, nerves attack, bypasses immune system so the pancreatic cancer spread wildly.

  
Pancreatic cancer basically is like a dead sentence to us, medical condition aren't advance here, even if it's so, the medical cost will be pretty expensive, not to mention it's suffer for him to undergo them.

  
I rarely post on reddit mainly because of the culture here, not really friendly.

  
So, here's my father story, about weeks ago, my dad felt enormous pain, and went drive to to hospital by himself, I didn't knew that, and after looking for him out of nowhere in the middle of the night, we saw him and direct him to the private hospital, upon body diagnosis, we were told, he had pancreatic cancer, at that time, he was still able to speak and eat, and move, yet after because my family, for any reason, my father didnt took any therapy but was fed with just pain killers, getting transferred around to hospital just to ease his pain, I continue to boil him american ginseng as I believe, it strengthen his overall health.

  
Turned out in just a week of time, he started to refuse eating, we thought, maybe he is just want to have his own space or what. Yet after few days more later, he has urinate pain again, went to the govt hospital, took a queue of around 5-6 hours and realized his bladder were filled full of bladder stones, mainly because my father never liked to drink water, but coffee and soft drinks thru out his late age, because of these reasons sum up, his body weight loss dramatically, if you see him you will cry.

  
I'm kind of out of clue, personally, I didn't have too much money to offer him to ESWL, where a treatment stones can be broken down thru vibrations. Neither my family wanted though, for they believe, it's better for him to leave than suffer, so no solution being offered to him but pain killers.

  
At around 9th, I realized something called ginsenoside, posted around the net, told to be effective on pancreatic cancer. Since I'm from South East Asia, I decided to take a look on it, there were one they are sold cheap for around $15, with label, ""RG3 & RH2"", the flight from China to my Country, and the delay on custom took over 11 days to arrive, it's really late. I've been playing with herbs for many years, upon taking above more than the recommendation dose, I felt, it's fake, it doesnt have any content inside.

  
I hate it, because it ran my time out from helping my father. At that time, I thought ginsenoside is the only herbs that could slow down the cancer from spreading and eventually restore the immune system, telling them to recognize the cancer cell they once ignored, it's just too late, The cancer cell have spread all over the body including the bone. 

Until then, I realize, it's not only actually ginsenoside is supportive on pancreatic cancer but the rare content of it called RG3 and RH2, while I'm not an expert, I've asked Grok to do the paper research for me, I mean Grok is the only one offer reading paper when the links were provided.

The AI said, the paper shows that it's effective on pancreatic cancer cell that was done thru animal experiments, it could even shrink the tumor size over some 60% or more, but that was done thru rat experiments, very least human clinical trial.

The AI provide that, RG3 is like a special unit force, get into the tumor and bomb them, stop the tumor from sourcing the blood to the cancer cells.  


While RH2 is like telling the cancer to delete itself, and also, restore the cancer cell return back to their old cells.

These seems too good to be true, I thought it were all real, I deep look into the Chinese website to get the herbs again, I mean I know people would refuse from buying from them, and it's true there are a lot of store selling fake medicine, and I'm taking a deeper research on looking which company is genuine, which company is licensed, and has the analytical paper of the ginsenoside content. I bought it, but knowing it takes really long to arrive, I find for alternative solution, I look and look and look and realize, it wasn't only ginsenoside that can be consider helpful on pancreatic cancer, there are some other things too, like curcumin (turmeric powder), or honokiol (magnolia bark extract).

I never consider curcumin because, I mean turmeric powder, how can that have anti cancer properties? I looked into honokiol, thought I could get them first before the RH2 RG3 arrived. Somehow, all of these stuff aren't available in my country. Have to buy it online thru other store, and found a store that is legit, based according to the reviews and the website's traffic stats.

The reason I bought honokiol was mainly because, this is what AI says.

""This 2021 paper, published in *Cellular Oncology*, investigates how honokiol (HNK)‚Äîa natural compound from magnolia bark‚Äîtargets perineural invasion (PNI), a major driver of pancreatic cancer's aggressiveness, poor prognosis, and metastasis. PNI occurs in 70‚Äì100% of cases, leading to nerve damage, pain, and spread along nerves similar to blood/lymphatic routes. The study uses human (PANC-1) and mouse (KPC) pancreatic cancer cells, in vitro assays, and mouse models to show HNK blocks PNI by inhibiting the TGF-Œ≤/SMAD2/3 pathway, which drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, invasion, and cancer-nerve crosstalk. No direct focus on NF-Œ∫B or apoptosis here; emphasis is on EMT and neurotrophic factors like NGF/BDNF.""

Keep in mind, not human clinical trial.

I thought what about have a try, upon reading deeper, I realize something called the bio-availability, supplements, have weaker absorption in body, so in order to increase the absorption, you might need maybe, get pro biotic to increase the gut, breakdown, etc.

  
I keep look for paper and paper, there are very least combination uses of on easing or maybe, cure pancreatic cancer.

  
I looked into the chinese herbs, Honokiol and Ginsenoside can be both, used together, given the message I was imprinted by the AI was, Honokiol is like tearing off the cancer cell's protection barrier (some specific model of pancreatic cancer cell), while RG3 and RH2 do the cell recovery and tumor bombing.

I heard a few stories about the RG3 and RH2 explicitly reduce the side effect of chemo, like body weight loss or refuse to eat, hair loss etc, I mean my dad refuses to eat now, he throat is so thin, when he drink he get choked.

The herbs just arrived together, I dont know about the effect it yet, there aren't too much information available on the chinese web, they all uses wechat, they dont use web or forums like us.

  
Hardly I see anyone sharing them, the only post that I saw, sharing his own experiences on battling with the pancreatic cancer by consuming the RG3 + RH2 supplement daily, along with, drinking ""Agrimonia pilosa"" tea (hong kong paper showed a clinical trial was done on human, 185 of them taking the traditional chinese medicine together with this tea, their life expectancy has increased an average of x2). So the person said, he said over the past 6 months he didnt saw any improvement, nor did he saw things are worsening. (I'm looking for the post, couldn't find it anymore). I mean, if 6 months seen no improvement, isnt that a better improvement?

Upon looking for that post, I found this,   
""Revolution Medicines Announces FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Daraxonrasib in Previously Treated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer with KRAS G12 Mutations""

Grok said this.  
""The link says that a new drug called **daraxonrasib (RMC-6236)** got special approval from the FDA to speed up its development for treating **advanced pancreatic cancer** in people with specific **KRAS G12 mutations**. This is a big deal because pancreatic cancer is very hard to treat, and most cases (over 90%) have these mutations, but there‚Äôs no targeted treatment yet. The drug is showing promise in early tests, and the company (Revolution Medicines) is running a major study to confirm it works better than standard chemo. They hope to have results by 2026, and this could lead to a new treatment option for a deadly cancer.""

  
Well, certainly that will be really costly, I will continue to explore more herbs and see if the combination ease him in anyway. Pray.",1,1761568245.0,pancreaticcancer,0,0.67,False

1ohd0mi,https://i.redd.it/tcrbikfpcnxf1.png,HSA newly available to me by my employer. Some questions.,"While working on my annual enrollment this morning, I found that an HSA is newly available to me. I do not use my employer's health insurance, as I use Tricare instead (National Guard), and this was never an option for me. This year, it is an option, even without using their health coverage. Interestingly, the maximum annual contribution limit is $3300, even though the IRS limits are $4300 ($4400 next year).

Is this odd? Or is this fairly standard?

I do not have a high deductible health insurance plan. If I elect to enroll in the HSA, will this get canceled come tax time?

Assuming I am able to take advantage of this HSA, can I later roll it over into a family HSA, or myself plus spouse HSA, once I retire or leave employment?

I am fortunately very healthy in my mid-40s, and am looking at doing this to reduce taxes and for another tax-advantaged savings vehicle, with the added bonus if I do need to spend it on medical care, it's triple tax advantaged.

EDIT: I haven't discussed this with HR yet, because they tend to be fairly worthless in regards to specific questions like these, in my experience, and I don't have the time in the day to wait to talk to a human. The advice I receive on Reddit WCI or on the forum are far better than HR.

EDIT AGAIN: This is an FSA, not an HSA. Coffee did not kick in yet this morning. Thanks. ",2,1761568023.0,whitecoatinvestor,6,0.75,False

It‚Äôs called the Four-Column Accounting Method, and it originated during China‚Äôs Tang Dynasty. Despite being ancient, it‚Äôs surprisingly simple, and powerful enough to help you save your first (or next) $10,000.

**What Is the Four-Column Method?**

It‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like, you track your money in four columns each month:

1. Beginning Balance ‚Äî How much you have at the start of the month.
2. Increases ‚Äî All income (salary, side hustles, investments, etc.).
3. Decreases ‚Äî Every expense you make.
4. Ending Balance ‚Äî What‚Äôs left after subtracting your decreases from your total.

That‚Äôs it. No fancy software, no complex categories ‚Äî just pure, honest tracking.  
And that honesty is what makes it work. You can‚Äôt hide from your spending when it‚Äôs right there in front of you.

**Example**

Let‚Äôs say you start the month with **$8,000** in your account.  
You earn **$6,120** (salary + side hustles + dividends),  
and your expenses total **$6,470** (rent, food, transport, loans, etc.).

Your ending balance? **$7,650.**

You‚Äôve actually spent more than you made ‚Äî and you can *see* it.

That visibility forces accountability. You immediately spot where you‚Äôre overspending and can make adjustments for the next month.

**Why This Method Still Works**

It‚Äôs not just about math ‚Äî it‚Äôs about behavior. Ancient Chinese money culture emphasized a few timeless principles that make this system effective even today:

* Frugality & self-discipline ‚Äî Save first, spend later.
* Long-term thinking ‚Äî Focus on security, not short-term pleasure.
* Family responsibility ‚Äî Planning ahead and saving for others.
* Education & value-based spending ‚Äî Spend on things that grow in value (skills, health, assets), not just status symbols.

These aren‚Äôt just cultural ideas ‚Äî they‚Äôre habits that quietly build wealth.

**How You Can Use It**

You don‚Äôt need to start on the 1st of the month.

Start today. Open a spreadsheet or notebook and make four columns.

Add your numbers for the month so far ‚Äî or even better, look back at the last three months using your bank or credit card statements.

Yes, it takes effort. But after doing it once, you‚Äôll have a crystal-clear picture of your real financial habits, the good, the bad, and the ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I spent that much on coffee.‚Äù

If you want to make this ancient rule actually work in modern life, try to adopt these three behaviors:

1. Stay humble ‚Äì Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of showing off your money. Contentment is underrated wealth.
2. Live below your means ‚Äì Aim to save 30‚Äì50% if you can. Even 20% consistently beats most people.
3. Spend based on value ‚Äì Ask: ‚ÄúDoes this purchase genuinely add value to my life?‚Äù

The Four-Column Method is old, but that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs powerful,  it‚Äôs built on simplicity, awareness, and self-control. Sometimes the best ‚Äúnew‚Äù money strategy is one that‚Äôs been around for over a millennium.",20,1761567700.0,PersonalFinanceTalks,2,0.83,False

1ohcuzh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohcuzh,An Evening in Kolkata (Rate My Brief Visit to Your Quaint City),"I was in Kolkata this weekend for an exam. Knowing that I was all set to tank up the exam, I had no intentions of studying but didn‚Äôt know what else to do either.

Reached Howrah Junction around 2:00 p.m. I had booked a dormitory, checked in, and after not being able to take a nap due to the scorching heat, decided to go out. Did some Googling for a while and made a rough itinerary.

Got out of the dormitory around 4:15 p.m. and walked to Jagannath Ghat. Not being able to reach the other side of the bridge due to heavy traffic, I walked upstream on the wrong side of the footpath and went through a flower market that turned into a dark alley towards the end ‚Äî but fortunately, it did lead me to the ghat. I reached just in time to witness the sunset. It was peaceful, with very few people around at that hour. I watched the sun set behind the Howrah Bridge, and as the bridge lit up, I started towards the only place I truly wanted to visit in the city ‚Äî The Indian Coffee House. After swimming through a sea of traffic, I finally reached the destination. For me, the very idea that people can just be at a place and hang out where legends like Tagore, Bose, and Ray once had their addas is pretty fascinating. Of course, I found a lot of crowd there ‚Äî something that I had grown familiar with by then. Fortunately, I managed to get a table upstairs. I ordered my coffee and a chicken cutlet and soaked in the vibe as I waited for my order. The coffee was great. After that, I wanted to explore the bookshops of College Street. I eventually picked up a small souvenir for myself ‚Äî The Royal Bengal Mystery by Ray (which I read on the train during my return journey) ‚Äî along with a couple of other books for ‚Çπ200 (I know the bargain could have been better, but never mind). After that, I wanted to have some mishti doi, so I just Googled ‚Äúsweet shops near me,‚Äù which led me to a shop called Putiram Sweets. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs considered a good shop or not, but the mishti doi was a little too mishti for my taste buds. üòÉ

That‚Äôs it ‚Äî that was my evening. Came back to the dormitory, tanked the exam the next morning, and returned to my city.

So, was this a good visit ?

My wife and I are heading to New Zealand this November for our first wedding anniversary. It‚Äôs roughly a 20-day trip covering both the North and South Islands.

Both of us like to take it easy - not ticking every box, just enjoying the place, and the vibe. So our plan is a mix of relaxing days + a few key experiences.

Our main bases are Mount Maunganui and Queenstown, and we‚Äôve splurged a little on nice Airbnbs to make sure we can truly unwind. We know we‚Äôll be skipping a few ‚Äúmust-do‚Äù places in NZ, but we‚Äôd rather come back refreshed than exhausted.

Would really appreciate it if you could take a look and let us know if this itinerary makes sense, and if there‚Äôs anything nearby we should definitely not miss. (We‚Äôve already booked most of our stays, so suggestions near Mount Maunganui and Queenstown would be the most useful!)

Itinerary

Nov 14-15: Auckland

Landing in Auckland in the morning, staying for about a day and a half.

Plan: Art galleries, Sky Tower, Commercial Bay, and Devonport.

Haven‚Äôt researched Auckland much, so open to any ‚Äúeasy to do in a day‚Äù ideas - food spots, hidden gems, walkable areas, etc.

Nov 17‚Äì21: Mount Maunganui

Plan: enjoy the beaches, walk up the Mount, do a couple of hikes, and take it slow.

One day trip to Rotorua - especially to see Whakarewarewa Village.

Heard traffic in Tauranga can get bad‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôre from India, so we‚Äôve probably seen worse.

Nov 22‚Äì24: Tongariro + Taupo

Doing the Tongariro Alpine Crossing on the 23rd.

Heading to Taupo on the 24th to chill for a day before flying to Queenstown on the 25th.

Looking for relaxing stuff in Taupo ‚Äî lakeside walks, cozy caf√©s, or anything easygoing.

Nov 25‚ÄìDec 2: Queenstown + Around

Exploring Queenstown, plus day trips to Arrowtown, Glenorchy, Wanaka, Central Otago, and Gibbston Valley. Really excited for this part of the trip.

Also have an overnight trip to Mount Cook and Lake Tekapo.

Open to any extra suggestions. Anything we shouldn‚Äôt miss in Queenstown?

Dec 3: Flying back home.

---

Bonus Idea

We‚Äôd love to do a motorbike day trip - ideally around Mount Maunganui or Queenstown.
Is that realistic? Any routes you‚Äôd recommend?

---

What We‚Äôd Love Suggestions On

Hidden gems/short day trips near Maunganui or Queenstown.

Great local food, coffee, or craft beer spots, and everything else. Easy nature walks, hikes, gardens, or fun local experiences, anything that might not find on the internet.

Thanks a ton in advance for your help. We‚Äôre beyond excited for this trip! üôè",1,1761567521.0,newzealand_travel,3,1.0,False
1ohct1m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohct1m,Episode 8 of The Podcast Against Giygas is up!,"[Listen to it here!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y8I7gw-3dTY&pp=ygUISGVhbGlqYWg%3D)


Welcome‚Ä¶ to Moonside!

Ness drinks the coffee, and finds himself in a spooky inversion of the big city of Fourside. Dodging monsters and wacky townspeople alike, Ness frantically heads closer and closer to the demon statue. Meanwhile, poor Jeff is still stuck in the real world, and it‚Äôs up to him to keep Ness‚Äôs body safe while his friend‚Äôs consciousness wanders around the neon nightmare world. And that‚Äôs a tall order in itself, what with Ness stumbling into heavy traffic, a security system full of deadly robots, and ugh, PORKY!!!

Will Jeff save the day at the top of the Monotoli building? Will Ness ever find a man in a Hawaiian t-shirt drinking a Mai-Tai who can successfully teleport him to a man with a unibrow and a gold tooth so he can get in before the melting Dali clocks make him take the math test again and again for the rest of his life? Will, uh‚Ä¶ will that last one make a little more sense in context?

Find out on this week‚Äôs episode of‚Ä¶ The Podcast Against Giygas!

ROCKIN!!!
