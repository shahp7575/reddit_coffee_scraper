( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pwwer3,https://i.redd.it/h3m6t4q2nq9g1.jpeg,The new setup: Profitec Move + Mazzer Philos (I189D),"I had a BBT for ~5 years. After it died this past November, I decided to go all-in on espresso and look into dedicated machines instead of AIOs. Thanks to various posts here and a ton of research overall, I landed on the Profitec Move and the Mazzer Philos (I189D) for my caffeinated workflow in the morning. 

I've pulled perhaps two dozen shots on it so far and my initial impression on this combo is wow. It is such a step up from the BBT. Everything from the 58mm portafilter to the heft of the Mazzer let's me know this is a different league of coffee making. The Mazzer is incredible. As many others have stated, it's built like a tank and I feel this will continue running smoothly 10 years from now without breaking a sweat. I love the dial in the back, and it love how fast it grinds my beans (currently using Passenger 's Daterra). Everything about the Mazzer, for me, lives up to the hype.

The Profitec is also wildly impressive. I really like how handsome the machine is, and it's super sturdy to boot. It definitely took some time getting used to, and I'm still figuring out different settings to use. I haven't played with pre-infusion yet, but I will soon. After 3-4 shots to dial things in, I found the shots I've pulled so far have been delicious, with a velvety mouth feel and beautiful notes of nuttiness, fruit, and chocolate. (I realize this is in large part to the I189D burrs on the Mazzer) 

I know there are better machines / setups out there, but for someone with three kids under five and a tight morning schedule, having this level of control + automation is huge, and it's something my wife can comfortably use too. I love the Profitec 's built-in shot timer and I love that I can pull a shot and steam milk at the same time. 

Hopefully this setup will make great espresso for years to come. I'm excited to try more and more beans and see what tasting notes I can discern. Thanks to this subreddit for being such a resource for folks like me! ",3,1766837525.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

# The Secret to Superior Coffee: Why a Burr Grinder is Non-Negotiable

Tired of bitter, inconsistent coffee? The culprit might be your grinder. While blade grinders chop beans haphazardly, a burr grinder is designed for precision, delivering uniform particle sizes essential for an exceptional brew.

Think of it this way: brewing is an extraction process. When coffee grounds are uneven, some particles over-extract (leading to bitterness), while others under-extract (creating sourness). Burr grinders, by crushing beans between two abrasive surfaces, produce a consistent grind, allowing for even extraction and unlocking the full spectrum of flavor your coffee beans have to offer. This precision is the bedrock of a truly great cup, from the first aromatic whiff to the last satisfying sip.

*   **Uniformity is Key:** Burr grinders crush beans into consistent sizes, ensuring even extraction and balanced flavor.
*   **Flavor Preservation:** They generate less heat than blade grinders, protecting the delicate aromatics and oils of the coffee beans.
*   **Versatility:** Adjust the grind size precisely, whether you're making espresso, pour-over, or French press.

Ready to elevate your home coffee game? Invest in a quality burr grinder and taste the difference.

1pwwe9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pwwe9v/i_built_a_free_prompt_generator_for_ai_image_and/,I built a free prompt generator for AI image and Agentic Software Projects,"Hey everyone,



Wanted to share something I've been working on for the past few weeks. It started as a personal tool because I got tired of writing and also remembering the  prompt structures and remembering every space in them over and over when using LLMs.



**The Problem**



Every time I wanted to generate an image, I'd spend minutes for thinking about lighting, camera angles, composition, negative prompts... and then I'd forget half of them. I had a messy Notes pages with  ""prompt templates"" but it was getting out of hand.



**What I Built**

Prompy is basically a structured form that helps you build detailed prompts. You pick your subject type, and it shows you relevant options - portrait gives you ethnicity/expression/pose options, product photography gives you background/material options, etc.



The cool part (at least for me) is the output formats. You get:

\- Natural language prompt (ready to paste into any AI tool)

\- JSON format (if you're building something that needs structured data)

\- TOON/TONL formats (experimental compact notations I've been playing with)



I also added an ""Objects & Relationships"" feature because I was frustrated that AI tools often ignore spatial relationships. Now I can specify ""person is holding the coffee cup"" or ""cat is sitting on the windowsill"" and it gets included in the prompt structure.



**The Tech Stack**



Nothing fancy - vanilla JS frontend with TailwindCSS, Python Flask backend, SQLite for storage. I specifically avoided React/Next.js because I wanted something simple that loads fast. The whole thing is under 200KB.



**Why Login?**

I know some people will ask about this, so let me explain upfront. The login (Google OAuth) is 100% optional. You can use the entire generator without signing in - generate prompts, copy them, use all presets, everything works.



Login is only for:

\- Saving your prompts to a personal gallery

\- Creating lists to organize prompts by project

\- Seeing generated prompts by other users



I added these features because I personally wanted to keep track of what prompts worked well for specific styles. Nothing is sold, no emails are sent, I'm not collecting data for any commercial purpose. The whole thing is open source so you can verify this yourself. I just want to make tights with and between users.



**Current State**

This is very much a beta. I've been using it myself and a limited circle whom in my Twitter list for a few weeks and it's stable, but there are definitely rough edges. The UI could use some polish, and I'm sure there are bugs which haven't founded yet.



Some things I'm considering adding:

\- More preset styles

\- API for integrations

\- Prompt generating for other purposes



**Links**

\- Live: [prompy.xyz](http://prompy.xyz)

\- Source: [github.com/niyoseris/photoprompt](http://github.com/niyoseris/photoprompt) (MIT license)



Would love to hear feedback.

What features would actually be useful? What's missing that would make you use this over just typing prompts manually?

Or her eyes which glare,
Beauty is none,
And if the world was blind,
She would be the ugliest soul,
As the beauty is behind,
Behind all layers of fake smile and facade,
Her Beauty is smaller than her heart,
And even smaller than her big car,
And her bags which fits only her pride,

And fakes her smile,

Can I right my wrongs?
We say it doesn't bother us
But what if it's tearing me apart 
The thought which I can't stop no more
Which linger in my heart so close 
The eyes which shut them up close
And the stomach which cries and growls 
As the thoughts grow's 
My lover,
Can I right my wrongs?
Can you feel what is going on
With my heart which cries and moans
My poems which i can't write no more
As my hands shiver 
Not with cold 
But my own thoughts 
Which seems to hold me close
Can I right my wrongs?
But I can write my wrongs
And even though so my hands are cold 
I was never the one who would be content with you 
I want more of you
I am greedy of you
I am naive and I won't share you
I don't care 
I want you 
Scared by fate 
Can I right my wrongs
I can't drink this feeling 
Scared by fate i wish there 
Was a healing 
Out of this 
Which leads me to you
As I am walking on a path of love
Jealous was never an issue 
What hurts me is what I did to you
Can I right my wrongs
But I can write my wrongs
So I 
Wrote this for you

I missed us realised I don't want you to leave 
I want you to be the one
The one I kiss while dozing off on my sheets
The one who holds my hand in movies
The one who caress my cheeks 
While my heart pounds 
And skips beats 
I want you and all of you
A new page or a book in your life 
The monents like stain of coffee on my shirt 
Which you loved
I wish we never grow apart 
My love grows every day, minute and hour
I wish you felt the same for me
I hope you still like coffee 
I really hope you still are the same 
The same I feel in love with 
I wish I am not your page but  your book

1pwwc7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThingsThatSolve/comments/1pwwc7u/how_to_lose_5kg_in_two_weeks/,How to lose 5kg in two weeks?,"**To lose 5kg in two weeks, you must combine a severe caloric deficit with strategic carbohydrate depletion to flush water. This approach forces your body to burn stored fat while rapidly draining excess fluid retention held in your cells. You will see the scale drop by maintaining high activity levels and strict nutritional discipline.**

I know why you clicked this. You have a deadline. Maybe it's a wedding, a reunion, or a beach trip, and you just realized your favorite jeans won't button. You are panicking. You don't want a lecture on ""slow and steady"" right now. You want the weight gone.

I’ve been there. I have coached hundreds of people who needed to drop weight yesterday.

The fitness industry hates answering this question. They want to sell you six-month coaching packages. But the truth is, you can drop 5kg (about 11 lbs) in 14 days. You just have to be willing to suffer a little bit and follow instructions with military precision. This isn't a lifestyle change. This is a sprint.

# Is it actually safe to lose 5kg in 2 weeks?

**It is generally safe for healthy individuals to lose 5kg in two weeks if done correctly for a short period. This rapid loss comes primarily from water weight and glycogen depletion rather than just pure body fat reduction. You must listen to your body and stop immediately if you feel dizzy or faint.**

Let’s get the math out of the way. To lose 1kg of pure fat, you need a deficit of roughly 7,700 calories. To lose 5kg of *pure fat*, you’d need a deficit of 38,500 calories. In 14 days, that’s a deficit of 2,750 calories per day.

For most of you reading this, you don’t even burn 2,750 calories a day.

So, how do we hit the 5kg number? We cheat the system. We target fat *and* water.

Your body holds onto water like a camel. For every gram of carbohydrate (glycogen) stored in your muscles, your body stores about 3 to 4 grams of water. If you carry 400g of glycogen, you are also carrying over 1.5kg of water attached to it.

When we cut the carbs, we drain the glycogen. When the glycogen goes, the water flushes out. That is an instant 2kg drop in the first 3-4 days. The rest comes from fat loss through a caloric deficit.

This isn't magic. It is biology. But you have to be careful.

If you have a history of eating disorders, stop reading. This aggressive approach is not for you. If you are generally healthy and just need to slim down for an event, keep reading.

# What should I eat to drop weight fast?

**You should eat lean proteins and green vegetables while strictly limiting carbohydrates to manipulate your insulin levels. This combination keeps your metabolism high and prevents muscle loss while your body switches to burning stored fat for fuel. You must eliminate sugar, alcohol, and processed foods entirely to see the necessary results.**

The diet is simple, but it is not easy.

For the next 14 days, your best friends are chicken breast, white fish, egg whites, spinach, and asparagus.

You are going to strip your diet down to the studs. No sauces. No ""little bites"" of your kid's sandwich. No cream in your coffee.

Here is why most people fail: they think ""eating healthy"" is enough. It is not. You can get fat eating healthy avocados and nuts. For this sprint, we need high volume, low calorie.

You need protein. A lot of it. Protein has a high thermic effect, meaning your body burns calories just digesting it. Plus, it keeps you full.

I use a specific method for this called Carb Cycling. We don't just cut carbs to zero forever; that crashes your metabolism. We rotate them.

[**Check out my book regarding this specific science here >>>**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZMHDWQP)

In the book, I explain the ""High/Low"" method. But for a 2-week emergency drop, we are doing a modified version: The Depletion Phase.

# The Food List

Stick to these items only. If it is not on the list, do not eat it.

* **Proteins:** Chicken breast (skinless), Turkey breast, Cod, Tilapia, Egg whites, Tuna (in water).
* **Vegetables:** Spinach, Cucumber, Asparagus, Zucchini, Celery.
* **Fats:** Trace amounts only (from the cooking spray or the meat itself).
* **Liquids:** Water, Black Coffee, Green Tea.

Notice what is missing? Fruit. Dairy. Nuts. Red meat.

Fruit is fructose. Fructose fills liver glycogen. We want to empty the liver.

Dairy causes bloating in many people. We want a flat stomach.

Nuts are calorie bombs. One handful can ruin your deficit.

You are going to be hungry. Accept it now. Hunger is just a feeling. It won't kill you.

# How much do I need to move daily?

**You need to move significantly more than usual by combining heavy resistance training with low-intensity steady-state cardio. This two-pronged approach burns glycogen stores during lifting and mobilizes fatty acids for energy during the walking sessions. You must aim for at least ten thousand steps daily on top of your scheduled workouts.**

Diet does 80% of the work. Movement does the rest.

But don't go run a marathon. High-intensity cardio like CrossFit or sprinting spikes cortisol. Cortisol makes you hold water. We are trying to lose water.

We want ""NEAT"" (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) and heavy depletion workouts.

# The Workout Structure

1. **Morning:** Fasted Walk (30-45 minutes). Do this before you eat anything. Drink water and go. This mobilizes fat while your insulin is rock bottom.
2. **Afternoon/Evening:** Full Body Depletion Workout.

The depletion workout isn't about hitting a PR (Personal Record). It's about burning the fuel in the muscle.

Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps. Rest only 45 seconds between sets. Keep the heart rate up, but not exploding.

* Squats (or Leg Press)
* Push-ups (or Bench Press)
* Dumbbell Rows
* Overhead Press
* Lunges

If you lift heavy weights with low reps, you don't deplete glycogen as efficiently. We want to wring out the sponge.

# The Step Count

This is non-negotiable. You need 10,000 to 12,000 steps a day.

I had a client, Mike. He nailed the diet but sat in a chair for 10 hours a day. He lost 2kg.

Another client, Dave, did the same diet but walked 15,000 steps. He lost 6kg.

Walking burns fat without triggering hunger or stress hormones. Walk at lunch. Walk after dinner. Pace while you are on the phone.

# Do women need a different approach?

**Women often need a modified approach because hormonal fluctuations throughout the month impact water retention and metabolic rate. This biological reality means the scale might not move linearly even if fat loss is actually occurring underneath. You must adjust your expectations and potentially increase fats slightly to support hormonal health.**

Ladies, your body fights back harder. It is designed to protect reproductive function.

If you are in the luteal phase of your cycle (the week before your period), you are naturally holding water. You might follow this plan perfectly and see the scale stuck.

Then, three days into your period, ""Whoosh."" You drop 2kg overnight.

Because of this, women often struggle more with the ""crash"" approach. The hunger hits harder. The energy crash is steeper.

I wrote a specific guide for this because the standard ""bro-science"" advice fails women constantly. You cannot just starve yourself; your body will shut down your thyroid.

[**Grab the women's guide to painless dieting here >>>**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089G81QW1)

For this 2-week sprint, women should keep protein very high but might need a small thumb-sized portion of fat (like 5 almonds or 1/4 avocado) with dinner to help with sleep and hormone regulation.

Don't panic if the scale doesn't move for 3 days. Trust the process. The fat is burning. The water is just masking it.

# What is the specific protocol to follow?

**The specific protocol requires following a rigid schedule of low-carb days followed by a single refeed meal. This cycle keeps your leptin levels from crashing completely while ensuring you remain in a deep deficit state. You must execute the following fourteen-day schedule exactly as written without any deviations or cheat meals.**

Here is the blueprint. Print this out. Stick it on your fridge.

# Days 1-5: The Depletion

* **Carbs:** Near Zero (<30g, only from veggies).
* **Water:** 4-5 Liters per day. Drink like a fish. This signals your body to flush water.
* **Salt:** Moderate.

You will feel terrible on Day 3. This is the ""Keto Flu"" or withdrawal. Your brain is screaming for sugar. Push through. Drink some salted water if you get a headache.

# Day 6: The Refeed

* **Morning/Lunch:** Same as days 1-5.
* **Dinner:** Carbs!

Have a potato. Have some rice. Keep the fats low.

This isn't a cheat meal. Don't eat a pizza. The fat in pizza will store as body fat because insulin is high. Eat pure carbs.

This tells your thyroid, ""We aren't starving."" It keeps the metabolic fire burning.

# Days 7-13: The Grind

Back to the Depletion protocol.

* **Water:** Keep it high until Day 12.
* **Day 13:** Cut water in half.

# Day 14: The Reveal

* **Water:** Sip only when thirsty.
* **Carbs:** Low.

By cutting water at the end, while your body is still in ""flushing mode,"" you will dry out. Your skin will tighten against the muscle. This is how fighters make weight.

[**Get the complete box set for the full plan details here >>>**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CYSSHW2)

# Supplements

I don't like relying on pills, but for 2 weeks?

* **Caffeine:** Helps with hunger and energy.
* **Multivitamin:** You are missing nutrients. Cover your bases.
* **Electrolytes:** Essential. Without carbs, you lose salt. If you feel dizzy, you need sodium and potassium.

# How do I handle the social pressure?

**You handle social pressure by planning ahead and being firm about your temporary goals with friends and family. This boundary-setting prevents accidental calorie intake from peer pressure or polite snacking at social gatherings. You must learn to say no or bring your own food without feeling guilty about your choices.**

This is where you lose the war.

You go to a dinner party. The host makes pasta. You feel rude. You eat it.

Game over.

Glycogen refills. Water returns. You gain 1.5kg overnight.

For these two weeks, you are a hermit. Or you are ""that guy"" with the Tupperware. Be proud of it.

Tell people: ""I'm doing a strict challenge for 14 days."" Most people respect a challenge. They don't respect ""I'm trying to watch my weight.""

""Trying"" sounds weak. ""Challenge"" sounds committed.

If you have to eat out, order plain grilled fish and steamed broccoli. Ask for no oil and no butter. Watch the waiter like a hawk. Kitchens love to drown veggies in butter to make them taste good.

# How do I stop the weight from coming back?

**You stop the weight from coming back by slowly increasing your calories and carbohydrates rather than returning immediately to your old eating habits. This process is called reverse dieting and helps your metabolism stabilize at a new maintenance level. You must reintroduce foods gradually over several weeks to avoid rapid fat regain.**

Listen to me closely. This is the most important part.

On Day 15, you will be 5kg lighter.

If you go back to eating how you used to, you will regain 6kg in a week.

Your metabolism is depressed. Your body is primed to store fat. It thinks you just survived a famine.

Do not binge.

You need to ""Reverse Diet.""

Add 100 calories back per week. Add 20g of carbs back per week.

Keep the protein high. Keep the walking high.

If you do this, you might keep 3-4kg of that loss off permanently. The water weight will come back (about 1-2kg), but the fat will stay gone.

This two-week sprint is a tool. It’s a hammer. Use it to break a plateau or get ready for a photo. Do not use it as a lifestyle. You cannot live on chicken and asparagus forever. You will be miserable.

Real, long-term success comes from a sustainable cycle. That’s what I preach in my books. But sometimes, you just need to see the scale move to get that spark of motivation.

You have the plan. You know the math. The only variable left is you.

Put the phone down. Go to the grocery store. Buy the chicken. Do the work.

See you in 2 weeks.

At the same time, I’ve been trying to get a nice cup out of an Ethiopian natural process coffee from Skylark. I found myself mucking around with different recipes on the V60 and then today, I decided to use my old Aerolatté no 4 flatbed- honesty nothing fancy, just my first pour over from when I was starting out maybe 10 years ago, and at time v cheap and broadly generic. 

Lo and behold, like magic, all the flavors came together and that was the best cup I’ve brewed with this coffee; really balanced flavor, lovely sweetness, notably body and hues of fruit throughout with a more mild acidity. Still, I found myself thinking that I might trade off some body for more clarity.

1pwwbdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pwwbdn/why_do_some_people_take_reading_so_seriously/,Why do some people take reading so seriously?,"Some people treat books and reading way more seriously than seems reasonable.

For example, I once visited a friend’s house and his father had this rigid “reading time”. It was a set schedule, every single day, for the same duration (can't remember, I think it was 90 minutes). At first, I assumed it was for the kids, like a family study routine. But no, he followed it even when the kids weren’t around. And these weren’t work books or things he ""had to"" read; they were contemporary fiction, classics, nonfiction, whatever.

I’ve met a lot of people like this, though not always in the exact same way. Some obsess over owning the “right edition” of a book. Some get pisse if you suggest audiobooks count as reading. Others seem offended if you criticize any book in their library.

I once made the mistake of calling a classic “boring” (I won’t say which, to avoid potentially offending anyone here), and I got a lecture on its value. The lecture has never ended because still when I meet that person, they pick up where they left off. Feels like criticizing the Bible in front of a devout Christian. Unfortunately now I have formed a strong hatred of that particular book and I dislike it much more than I did originally, all as a reaction to this person. I know, it's irrational, but I'm just saying this can happen.

Here’s the thing: no author is perfect. Not Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Joyce, Woolf, Austen, Hemingway, Stephen King, J.K. Rowling… no book is perfect. Every idea can be questioned. Books are just ideas written by people. Yes, they can be beautiful works of art and you can keep them and value them, and you can take reading as seriously as you like, but don’t force others to share your perspective.

If you’re passionate about a book, great. But obsessing, policing, or idolizing it doesn’t encourage more people to read. I think it alienates them. Let people read how they want, listen to audiobooks, spill coffee on their book pages, or even throw them on the floor. Life’s too short to lose your mind over books. If it's their books and their time, let them do what they want.

If the ideas in these books you value are beautiful, they’ll speak for themselves. YOu can certainly recommend a book and set the scene but otherwise Let the ideas sing themselves. And if the song is beautiful, people will stop and listen. If the song is not beautiful to them, they will move on. You shouting at people around who don't like the song will not make the song suddenly beautiful.

[28F],"I’m 28 and I met a guy randomly on the street. We talked a bit, then started chatting, and the next day he asked me out for coffee. Even though I wasn’t really attracted to him at first, I told myself, “okay, I’ll give it a chance and see.”

But I felt absolutely no physical attraction ,actually, I felt a kind of aversion. Even though the date was pleasant, the whole time I just wanted to leave and go home and be alone (I’m very introverted).

Now he keeps texting me, and even texting feels draining and exhausting. I don’t feel excitement or curiosity, just tiredness.

I’m torn because people keep telling me to “give it time” and that attraction can grow. I’m also scared of losing a potentially good partner just because I don’t feel anything right now  but at the same time, I really don’t *want* to continue.

A big part of the problem is pressure from my family. They keep telling me I’m already “old,” that I shouldn’t have high standards, and that feelings don’t matter  only stability does. This makes me doubt myself a lot.

So what should I do?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Going outside and being amongst nature was a true pleasure, something that I would do most weekends, come rain or shine. I no longer want to do this. Not anymore. I've tried to think, theorise even, about what I have been through. Something rational, something real to this experience. I just can't. I'm hoping that writing this down might help? Help me process this shit, or at least try to.

It happened on Saturday, which was two days ago. I had gotten up early, hoping to make a quick head start so I would have the rest of the day to do what I wanted. I had planned this weekend for a couple of weeks now, and finally I had a long weekend to enjoy myself. I wasn't needed at work on Monday, so it allowed me to spend the next couple of days camping in my local woodland, Tingrass Woods. Tingrass is relatively small, being only about 15 hectares, but its beauty is unlimited. Shimmering streams and endless oak trees are some of the more dazzling features in there, however, I personally believed that the old mines surrounding the woods were the spotlights.

Tingrass, like its namesake, used to have tin mining in the area. Tin was the town's livelyhood, and was used often for ""revolutionary"" tin cans. The majority of men worked down there in those caverns, and nearly everyone who lives in the town today had at least one person in their family tree who mined tin.

However, on the 4th of December 1966, the Shear shaft collapsed and around 20 men were trapped under the roof of the cave that day. The Shear mineshaft was well-known as the cave with the most amount of tin hiding within it, and so, they mined there the most. It was thought they hit a supporter beam, and because of the cavern's weakened state, the entire ceiling fell. The state spent a month trying to get them out, but it was no use. The boulders were too big, and there wasn't much to do anything about it. At least not in those days. My grandfather was caught in the devestation, and in the end, my father was left with his mother and his two younger sisters.

They're mostly blocked off nowadays, and it's extremely difficult to even reach the entrances due to the rangers patrolling the area all day and night, looking for rambunctious kids wanting somewhere to get wasted or already-tipsy adults hoping to get even more wasted.

However, most people just watch them from afar, creeped out by the things. I mean, the black voids of the openings were definitely unnerving, to say the least. But, I found an eerie curiosity with them. My grandfather worked in those mines all his life, quite literally. My dad used to take my brother Tommy and I there when we went camping as kids and told us how, ""our grandaddy used to work day and night in those caves."" It’s part of my family history, and somewhere in that deep dark, my grandfather is lying there. Dad had never wanted to go down there, though. He stayed far away from them when camping and if he ever came close to mines, he'd come back home all jumpy, checking every room in the house and hugging my mom, Tommy and I when he saw us.

I suppose that strange anxiety is why he taught my brother and I how to get around those woods and to never go in those mines. I've been tempted, of course, but I've always stopped myself before I ever tried to sneak in. I didn't want to end up like my grandfather, and so, I avoided going near them for most of my life. Still, we continued to hike and camp with them in sight, which slightly desensitised my brother and I to their prescence.

I don't feel that way much anymore.

I packed enough food and drinks for the next couple of days, organising them in my rucksack. Beans and noodles would do me fine, and I even brought my portable kettle for coffee. This was a routine packing that I had done many times before. My tent would be in the left-hand side of my rucksack, with the sleeping bag resting in the middle, on top of the food and water. On the right would be my GPS, maps, and essentials, like first aid supplies, portable chargers, etcetera. Easy enough to remember, even with my terrible memory.                       

I set off at eight-thirty in the morning. Riding in my beloved Toyota Tacoma, the roads were thankfully clear. The bright sun shone beautifully over the Montana fields that day. I took a couple of pictures along the way to send to Tommy, who had moved out of state last year. He was living the high life at Stanford, lucky bastard.

I finally reached Tingrass at around nine-ish. The wind was low, and the late summer sun warmed my body. There were a couple of cars in front of the woodland. At least I wasn't the only one to take advantage of the glorious day.

With my rucksack on my back, I began my trek into the expansive treeline and took a quick look over to the abandoned mines. There were a pair of rangers trucks parked outside the two quaint log cabins, which were about 150 meters away from the mineshafts. I recognised one of the trucks parked next the other, the chipped sticker of the Wood Rangers emblem plastered on the door, ""WUTHERS CREEK RANGERS - GUIDE AND PROTECT"" written. His red dice dangled on the front mirror. Robbie was on patrol that day, usually doing the night shift as well as the day shift. He's my best friend and the only other person apart from myself who knows about what happened. Apart from you guys reading this actually.

I walked through the trees, and followed the Chessock Trail with ease. This trail headed to the middle of the woodland, although I didn't go that far. I waved hello to the odd traveler and showed a young couple where to go to reach the centre.

I continued wandering along the path, aiming to reach Babbler's Brook before ten. Or Brucie's Brook, as my friends and I called it. My old college buddy Bruce had one too many vodka lime sodas and ended up throwing up in the once-clear water, before quickly falling in and squealing like a little girl at the below-freezing temperature. I still have the video.

My timing was somewhat acccurate and I reached the brook at around ten. I slung my rucksack to the large oak tree next to the rushing water. I stretched and took a deep breath of that fresh air, crisp enough to cut silence itself. The bubbling of the water, the cheery sing-song of the birds above and the scurrying of squirrels and other little animals along the grassy floor. My bliss. My paradise. The sun was shining through the bushy leaves of the oaks, providing a large amount of sunlight for the rest of the day.

I spent most of the day there, taking pictures, doodling in my sketchbook and texting Robbie to let him know to drop by whenever he got a break. I also had to send some emails for work; being an intern has its perks, as well as its major downsides.

It was just around four when I headed back to camp. The sun was still high in the sky, but the shadows told me that darkness would be on its way soon. I chucked my rucksack onto my back and trudged back down the Chessock Trial. I let out a yawn and rubbed my eyes. It was an early start for me after all. I just let my feet take me where they knew to go. I was so away with the fairies that I didn't see the damned black book in my way. Why didn't I move slightly left? Or right for that matter. I could've missed it and avoided all this shit.

Instead, I clumsily tripped over it, and caught myself from falling face-first.

I spun around and furrowed my brow. I didn't realise what I'd stumbled on until I squinted at the obstruction in the path. As if it was placed there, a book was sat on the path, closed and waiting. I picked it up and dusted off any dirt that laid on the dark cover. It weighed heavily in my hand, which caused me to clutch the thing with two hands. There was no writing on the front, just a plain leather-bound outer cover. A silky string ran down the side of the pin-straight spine, untattered and a contrasting cream colour. The pages were a slight yellow, colouring the once-ivory edges.

I pouted. This wasn't here when I walked this way earlier.

Maybe someone dropped it whilst they were walking. It was certainly the most obvious and logical reason. Right?

I blinked, then tucked the tome under my arm, the heaviness made my arm ache as I carried it back to camp. I had to swap it between each arm to stop them from paralysing from the constant dull pain.

Finally, I reached camp. It was a place I knew well. Here, I knew the way out and the way to the centre, which would take less than twenty minutes for me to reach the entrance if need be. The sun still hovered above the endless treeline, and showed me how long I had before I was gripped by dark. Setting up the tent was always a pain in my ass, but I suppose everyone feels that way when putting up the damn things. I was zipping up the doorway to my home for the next couple of days when I first felt sick. It was a sudden rush of nausea, bile speedily crawling up my throat and the acid sorching the way. I fell onto my hands, knees already crouched. The sickness reached my mouth before I held it there, and then forcefully swallowed the vile, chunky liquid back down. What the hell was that?

I squatted there a good ten minutes, head pounding like I had smashed my head repeatedly on an iron pole. By the time my migrane subsided, the sun had dropped, sneaking behind the branches of the mighty oaks. I needed the fire made, and quick. Last time I tried to set a fire in the dark I nearly ended up destroying the whole woods. ""*Don't light a damn fire if you don't know where you're keeping it.*"" My father's scolding voice rang in my already pulsing head. I was drunk and I was also trying to impress a girl I was camping with by showing her my ""survival skills"". Safe to say, she didn't text me back after that.

Fumbling for my lighter, I tried to catch a flame. I had already set a little bundle of dry branches and leaves earlier whilst I set up camp, so I didn't have to forage for kindling in the twilight. Luckily, the light caught and a small, popping ember began to rise, before it spread onto each dead twig and mossy green leaf. I'd need the heat to be warm for the rest of the night anyway.

Finally, I took a seat on my camping chair. I had left the book on my bag and I was going to read it after I had my dinner of beans. What a banquet. However, I had a call from Robbie whilst I was cleaning up and stayed on the phone for the next couple of hours. I told him to drop by, which he agreed and would arrive later, where he would bring some snacks and beer for us to share. Yes, I know it wasn't great for either of us to be drinking in this sort of situation, with me being in the woods on my own, and Robbie ""technically"" on patrol. However, Robbie's dad was the sargent of the rangers, so it wasn't really a fear that he would be fired, and I never drank so much that I wasn't in control of my own actions. Bruce's late-night bender put me off doing that anymore.

The sun's orange and crimson rays bled through the treeline, blackness oozed from the shadows. I took my last picture for Tommy. He kept texting me about how home was, how mom and dad were, and what his semester at Stanford was like. He'd met a girl called Martina and they'd hit it off. He was living his life, and I was proud of him. Leaving home and looking to make your name in the big, wide world was a lot for anyone, let alone a dweeby 18 year old like him. So yeah, I'm pretty damn proud of Tommy. He asked me, ""*you seen anything cool out there?*"", before adding, ""*apart from those lame-ass landscapes?*""

I was about to retort, saying something like, ""*Yeah this!*"" and send a crude photo, but my eyes fell on my right side. It was then that I remembered the book. It was laid on my rucksack, ebony leather became inky in the sunset light. It would be a while before Robbie made his way over, so I thought ""why not?""

I picked it up for a reason. I sent a photo to Tommy, and I put ""*Found this thing on my way back from Brucie's Brook.*""

He came back to me, ""*What is that? Is it the Death Note or some shit?*""

""*No idea, just found it in my path coming back, it wasn't there before tho?*""

The little bubble popped up, then dropped, then came back again.

""*Holy shit it IS! Bro who you killing first? I know you want to, you psycho.*""

I rolled my eyes. I took Tommy out for a drive when he was a kid, just after I passed my test, and a squirrel was hiding behind the car's back left wheel and when I had to reverse out the driveway I squashed the poor thing. Unfortunately, Tommy and I went out to check and the dumbass screamed so loud it rattled all the windows in the neighborhood. A little pool of blood surrounded the flattened mammal, its splayed out position and crushed head made its eyes pop. Poor fella. I felt terrible, but Tommy was distraught. The only way I could get him into the car was to promise to take him to McDonald's after our drive. He was 12 at the time, and he still goes on about it now. ""Caused him trauma"" apparantly.

I texted back that he needed to get a life apart from consuming anime in his every waking moment, and looked over at the book once more. Tommy sparked my imagination. Someone dropped it. Surely.

""*Well? What's in it?*""

I read the message before I placed my phone on the seat next to me and reached over to pick the book up from my bag. Whilst I ran my fingers along the smooth spine, my phone buzzed again. I took no notice. I just stared at the black tome weighing down my hands.

Lifting up the hard cover, I took a peek at the first crispy yellowed page. It was blank, except for a date written in scratchy handwriting. 30th November 1966. 1966? What? This was a joke, I thought. It had to be. It must have been some kids scaring people. Something black covered a large area in the middle, like how a government organisation removed names and used black blocks on hidden files. It was more accidental though? It reminded me of spilt ink.

I flipped to the next page. This showed a diary entry, written on the next date. This isn't the entire entry, rather a summarized version, as this would be easier to read.

*1st December 1966.*

*Lewisham has been speaking to everyone about the mine's infrastructure. He's jabbering on about the creaking, the creaking from above. Management's been to have a look and they've found nothing. So what the hell is he going on about?*

*I spoke to Tim and he doesn't hear nothing. I don't think Lewisham is made for this, after all if he's worried about the sounds these caves make, what is he even doing here? It's a mineshaft. Honestly, the kids they get these days. Mind you, it's better than the new machines they're looking about bringing in. They're taking our damn jobs.*

*How will I pay the taxes, hell, even for the presents this year if they cut me? Peggy will have to try and pull the weight too, bless her. I cannot put this pressure on her. I will be the indispendable tool for them, so they can survive. I must be valuable. For them.*

I flip over the page to the next entry.

*2nd December 1966.*

*The rest of the boys are starting to hear something from above. I strain to hear things, although I do hear something.*

*Extremely quiet squeaks come from the ceiling. I can't let it detatch me from my work, unlike Lewisham. The man's going mad. He grabbed me today whilst I was pushing the trolley. His eyes were red and dry, very wild and twitching.*

*He says, ""Do you hear it, my friend?""*

*I squinted at him and asked what he meant.*

*He replied, ""The - (this bit was scratched out and I was unable to read it) - can't you hear it?""*

*I stared at him for a while and shook my head. Something wasn't right with that boy. However, I now worry, he may be right. Whether the sound is what he says it is, I sincerley hope it is a wild fantasy of his, rather than one of fact. He warned me of the terror to come, lest we leave this cavern. I didn't see him for the rest of the day after that. He knows something, and I'm afraid I know it too.*

Entry three changed the format slightly. More snappy and direct, almost rushed.

*3rd December 1966.*

*I feel the shakes. I feel the aches. It is creaking, and the boys know it. We have appealed to management to have a simple review of the shafts above. Denied. They make us think we are stupid. We are imagining things. Fools.*

*Lewisham has since handed in his resignation. He cannot go near the shaft without shaking like a leaf or turning white. Management call him a coward. To make us stay here. They care not for any of us, just tin. The damned tin.*

*The darkness groans and it moans. It wants us gone. We all know what Lewisham meant.*

*A source within the Earth has controlled them. Money shall enslave them to enslave us. Always.*

The final entry reads as follows.

*4th December 1966.*

*The men have bolted from the place. Many have lost jobs. I have stayed. Not for my own greed, but for my wife and children. Peggy's boss will not pay her more. They will not grant her the money she deserves, and so, she is forced to work twice as hard for half the pay. My darling Peggy. She should not have to endure this.*

*I am at work, not of my own violition. The mouth of the mine is darker today, and it churns my stomach. It was deep black, welcoming me. Begging and coaxing me to take the plunge.*

*I must. I must.*

*The aches and groans are almost ridiculously loud now.*

*It is in pain, we have taken too much.*

An icy hand brushed the back of my neck, long fingers raked the skin. My eyes widened and I stopped breathing.

It was barely noticable but it was too cold to ignore. As soon as it stroked my skin, it disappeared. I held my breath until I could no longer, wheezing and spinning my head around to see who, or what, that was.

Nothing. Just my tent and the vastness of the woodland.

Even though I've had time to think about this, I couldn't explain what that was. At all.

It was silent and chilly. The sun was long gone and the fire had nearly finished dying. My phone was dead. I don't know how long I was there for. I don't even know how I read anything in that light.

It hurt to blink. It took around twenty blinks before they began to lubricate with tears again. Then, I realised something.

I didn't know where I was.

I am being fully serious here, I had no idea where I was or why I was there. What brought on this random amnesia? Only God knows. Looking back, it had to have been because of that diary. I mean, how else would I forget a place that I had been going to for over a decade?

All I had was my tent, so I switched on my lamp and reached for my equipment. I was not spending my time outside, not any longer. Before I put out the fire I made sure to have a long look at the abyss, and found nothing. Still, whilst I chucked my bag into the tent, I kept taking quick glances, checking for anything skulking around in the treeline. Nothing came like before, thank God. I wouldn't know anyway. The light made it impossible to see anything.

I zipped up the door and huddled in the corner on my sleeping bag, then rubbed my neck. It was still bitterly cold to the touch. It was so cold I swear it burnt my hand. I dipped into my bag and retrieved my portable charger, before I quickly plugged the wire into my powerless phone. I had a while to wait before I could use it with good charge, and I knew that. I think that's why my eyes stared at the diary.

Dazed, I watched as my hands picked up the book again, and they slowly opened to the diary entry I left off from.

It was covered in ink. The rest of the passage was blotted out. I swear there was writing there. There was writing there before. I stared at the black puddle in disbelief. This wasn't right.

I flipped to another page. Then another. Then another. All were a dried black mess.

All apart from the second to last page. Thinking about this even now makes my neck hairs prick up and my stomach drop.

It was completely plain, no ink was on the page, except for the scrawled words:

""*It no longer whispers. It screams.*""

The world went blurry after that, and a growing ringing, no, rumbling climbed in volume. It rang loudly in my ears, so much so, I dropped the diary and clasped my hands over my ears. It didn't stop it, and instead made it louder by adding distant male screams to the caucophony. That hideous din, the fear, the destruction. I felt it all, bones rattled under my muscles, almost trying to escape the sounds by jumping straight out of my skin. I squeezed my eyes shut, tears streamed down my cheeks and my body vibrated, as I know believe I was screaming and sucking in ragged breaths when my lungs ran out of air.

I could hear things wiping their hands against the fabric of the tent, like they were trying to claw their way in. They were slow at first, and then they became more insistant, more furious. Feet began to join the constant racket, stomping and running around me, all were frantic and disjointed. It was like hundreds of men were fleeing from some sort of monumental force.

My eyes, although closed, saw things. Flashes of men running for their lives in the dark, their dirty faces had stretched their eyes and mouths wide, illuminated by the weak parafin lanterns dotted around the cracked walls. These visions would happen for such a short amount of time, I couldn't even remember how many went past my quivering eyelids, and soon it became a frenzied nightmare. They were all from different perspectives, some of the later ones would even be from a third person perspective; a fly on the wall in this horrific desolation. Men had their strong bodies contorted into malformed postions, with their limbs crooked and bent at aggressive angles. Pops and cracks were often heard along with squishing sounds like raw meat hitting a hard surface. Eyes bulged and stared at the midnight sky, as they gawped at the giant chunks of charcoal stone which plummeted towards them, and entrapped them in the perpetual blackness.

These unlucky men cried for their families. They howled for their brothers and sisters. They wailed for their mothers and fathers. God it didn't stop. The things begged for their wives and mothers to help them. Help which would never come. They were abandoned. They were dead, and they knew this. They knew they were bound to their torment. They could not accept it. The shouting grew, and broke into a swirling clamour, whines and moans of pain added to the horrid collection of voices. It was ear-splitting.

Pure inexplicable dread filled my stomach and spread to my mind, as I felt my lungs squeeze inwards and forcibly push the clean air out of them. All I could do was cough. All I could do was shake. All I could do was scream. There was no running, there was no hiding, just death. I could smell it in the air, as rot and decay were now in every breath I took. I can't even describe what it tasted like. It was heavy and putrid, with hints of a chalky aftertaste.

The best way I could describe it would be when Robbie and I went on a walk together in Tingrass when we were young. There was a horrible smell in the air and we both immediately inhaled it. We walked towards the smell by following our noses. I can remember how Robbie vomited his mom's lunch onto the floor when we found out what it was. It was a deer carcass. A huge stag was laid on its side, and its crimson ribs were exposed to the sky. The guts of the animal had been removed, as well as the lungs and diaphragm. The same applied for the kidneys and the liver. The most vile thing about it all was its head. It's eyes were rolled back into its skull and left the jellied sockets wet with dark blood. I could see a couple of white maggots crawling around, eager for sustinance. There was also an attempt to break into its head and squeeze out the brain. Whatever had scratched off the outer skin had failed, and the cracked pink bone was shown. Mountain lions weren't often seen around these parts, which is ironic because Mount Wuthers was literally right next to our town, so it was odd to see an animal this brutally attacked. Rather stripped for parts. The stench was scarily close to what I had smelt in the tent, like I was sat in the corpse of that deer.

Suddenly, scratches cut through the hellish sounds. They stopped in an instant and I felt something warm drip down my nostrils and eyes. The men, I thought, wanted me. They were going to punish me for reading that evil tome. I forced my eyes open and I stared at the crouched figure which prodded at my flimsy tent door. I shoved my hand into my bag and pulled out my hunting knife. I brandished the blade and held it close to my chest. Then, with trembling hands, I reached for the zipper, knife prepared to plunge into the foul creature that groped at my door.

""Matt, it's Robbie! Let me in!""

Robbie. He wasn't supposed to be there until ten. It could've been anything out there. For all I knew, that could've been one of those perished men who wanted to use me to bring their decimated corpses back to life. I blame my knowledge on local folk tales and also the fact I just had a horrific experience that I felt the need to ask him:

""If you're really Robbie, what did you buy me for my eighth birthday?""

Silence.

""What?""

""You heard me, what did you buy me for my eighth birthday?"" I asked him again.

Silence once more.

""I got you a Lego Batman building set? The Arkham Asylum one.""

Shakily, I opened the flap, my hands shook whilst pulling up the zipper.

Surely enough, there Robbie was squat, dressed up in his ranger's uniform and holding a shotgun in one hand, with a lit flashlight in the other. I genuinely thought he was one of the dead men in the mineshaft. My mind grew dull and my ears heard a high-pitch squeal, something like tinnitus.

His look of concern grew into one of shock and horror, ""Matty, what the fuck happened to you?""

I just sat there dumbly, and so, he slowly began to reach his hand out to touch my shoulder. He was warm. I was not.

He pulled me out the tent gingerly as if I was a wild animal. I don't remember much, only that Robbie had picked up my phone and we had made it to the cabins that the rangers use for their night rounds. He spoke to me, asked me questions. I couldn't answer him. My throat was torn and when I finally came to, the pain made it impossible to even breathe.

I sat on Robbie's bed, a quilt wrapped around my shoulders. He stayed with me for a while and told Tina, the other ranger on watch that night, that I had came down with a cold and I was going to spend the night in the warmth and head home in the morning. She brought me a cup of lemon tea for my throat and gave me a pitiful smile before she left to keep watch. Robbie wiped my nose with a tissue, and when he pulled it away to get a fresh one, I saw the blood soaked into the crumpled paper.

Robbie gave me two twisted up corners of a tissue and instructed me to put it up my nose, as it was still bleeding. He then handed me my phone with a grimace and told me, ""You should probably text Tommy.""

When I looked at my plugged in phone, I had 15 texts and 3 missed calls from Tommy, as well as 9 texts and 11 missed calls from Robbie. How long was I out? Who knows.

Tommy kept on texting me, ""*Hello*?""  and ""*This is a shitty joke Matt*"" and most disturbingly, ""*Stop it!*""

I had sent him pictures, about fifty, all of the diary. They were of the front cover, the pages, the back cover, all of it. I had even taken pictures of the woodland, although you couldn't see much, as they were either blurry or pitch-black.

I had done the same to Robbie. He was obviously worried and confused, and had set off to come and help me.

I then registered that I didn't know where the diary was. I prayed and hoped that Robbie left it behind, and didn't bring that wretched thing with us. I quietly murmured, ""Did you bring the book here?""

Robbie pulled a face. ""Dude, what are you talking about?""

""The black book! It should've been on my right side, or my left?"" My voice was nervous and, even worse, desperate.

He looked me dead in my eyes and told me:

""Matt, I didn't see a book there.""

What the hell did that mean? How? I still don't know the answer to that even now. My eyes stung. The damn thing evaporated into thin air.

Robbie noticed my distress and asked softly, ""What happened to you?""

I told Robbie everything, all with a raspy voice and taking sips of the scalding hot lemon tea. I showed him the pictures and my texts from Tommy. After I had finished, Robbie stared intently at the floor for about two minutes, eyes flickered from one side of the wood to the other. The air was tense and I felt like we had been sat like that for an eternity. Eventually, he took a deep breath in, and faced me. He believed my story, he just couldn't fully process everything yet, which I fully accepted. I couldn't even wholly remember this situation myself, so I can't even comprehend what he thought of all this.

Robbie took the couch that night and gave me the bed. I would occasionaly hear him get up and leave to check on Tina and actually do his job. When Tina was done on her shift, she came into the cabin and got some shut-eye herself. She was probably told by Robbie to stay there for the night. The reason was most likely in case something happened to me again, and that he was spooked by the whole incident so he kept Tina close.

I came home yesterday morning when Robbie finished his shift. He let Tina go home first, we both bid her farewell and saw her drive away in her truck. I certainly felt better than the night before and I told Robbie that I would be fine driving home on my own. He reluctantly agreed, but he wanted to come with me to get my stuff and my truck. He watched me like a hawk the entire way there and walked just behind me for the whole trek. We packed up my tent, kicked away my old fire kindling and sorted out my bag that I had left overnight. Thankfully, nothing was stolen. It was just like how it was last night. The only thing missing was the diary, which I hoped stayed gone forever.

There was no birdsong or any squirrels that chased each other in the trees. There weren't any people who walked by or distant chatter either. It was just dense silence. It hung so heavily in the air, almost like a bomb had gone off and erased all life from the area. I was stunned by how unusually still the woods was that morning, and I could tell it unsettled Robbie. He just stifly put things away and stayed quiet, much like me. We wanted to get out of there.

Strangely enough, the further we left the camping spot, the more alive the woods became. Sparrow chirps and fellow travellers returned, which eased us both. We reached the entrance and hauled my stuff into the back of the Tacoma. I thanked Robbie for all his help and opened the door to my truck, before I hopped in. As I was about to say goodbye to Robbie, he held the door window and his dark eyes stared straight into my soul.

""Call me if anything else happens, m'kay?"" It was more of an order than a request.

I nodded, started up my truck and drove home.  Yesterday, nothing really happened. Robbie came over to check up on me anyway just to see how I was doing. I kept all the lights on upstairs when I went to bed though, I didn't want to be left in the dark again. I slept like a log for most of the night. I only got up once. It must've been some sort of primal instinct because when I opened my eyes I felt as though I was being watched. It was like all the hair on my neck shot up and a hard lump weighed in my throat. I sat up slowly and observed the room. Everything still looked the same - all the lights were on and my door had remained closed. I grabbed my hunting knife and checked the house to ease my racing mind. I found the house identical to how I left it, not thing out of place. The feeling then drifted away and I dragged my weary body back to bed.

I can't tell you what happened that night. I seriously don't know. Part of me feels like it was some kind of bizarre hallucigenic seizure, or just an odd dream. But, part of me knows that was real. It was fucking real. More real than reality.

Something happened to me that night and it wasn't normal. Hell, even Robbie knows that and he's not the biggest believer in the supernatural.

And you know what, neither was I. Not until that night or until today.

You see, at around noon I made myself a coffee and looked through some emails to prepare myself for the meeting I have tomorrow. I left the living room for five minutes. Five fucking minutes.

Nothing could've happened in that time. No one, even if they squatted in that room for days, could've done anything. It simply wasn't possible. I would have heard them.

So you can imagine the absolute scare I had when I saw that diary laid on my coffee table in front of my laptop, wide open with the string running down the crack in the book. It was acting as a mocking bookmark, almost like it was doing me a sick favour.

It reads:

""*5th December 1966.*""

That is why I have decided to write this down. I need to prove to myself that I'm not crazy and I need assistance.

Someone, anyone, can you help me? I don't know what this thing is and I want, no, need this thing gone.

Please, I need knowledge on this thing. As I write this I keep looking over to it. Writing keeps appearing on the page everytime I look back. It's filled one page now and looks like it's going to start the other.

A couple weeks later she started sending me messages how iam not respectful and why iam sending her ""inappropriate"" messages, the same messages she laughed reading and made sure i knew that ... i just ignored the texts and deleted her .

Months have passed and a couple days ago she messaged me saying "" why u acted in such a disgusting way and you gave off a grap.est vibe"" now that pissed me off so i asked her to stop harrasing me and i dont want to speak with her, she kept messaging and i told her to stop and leave me alone and stop creating scenarios in her head that didnt happen then blocked her on all media platforms .

Thinking about it, one of the reasons i stopped talking to her was that she seemed mentally unstable and super cheap and loves money to the point she sued every single person that came to fix something in her house, that sounded kinda fishy tbh so i just stopped talking to her .

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

please take a seat or a good minute to read, and be brutally honest, I am here to know the real deal 

1. deep down (wrote it for a friend) 

Deep down the fire and ice 
Deeper than my conscious 
Dig deep into her eyes
The beauty is not her face or hair
Or her eyes which glare
Beauty is none 
And if the world was blind
She would be the ugliest soul
As the beauty is behind 
Behind all layers of fake smile and facade 
Her Beauty is smaller than her heart
And even smaller than her big car
And her bags which fits only her pride
Her beauty lies in her lies
As she lies to the world 
And fakes her smile 
And if the world was blind
She would be the ugliest soul

2. Write my wrongs

Can I right my wrongs?
We say it doesn't bother us
But what if it's tearing me apart 
The thought which I can't stop no more
Which linger in my heart so close 
The eyes which shut them up close
And the stomach which cries and growls 
As the thoughts grow's 
My lover,
Can I right my wrongs?
Can you feel what is going on
With my heart which cries and moans
My poems which i can't write no more
As my hands shiver 
Not with cold 
But my own thoughts 
Which seems to hold me close
Can I right my wrongs?
But I can write my wrongs
And even though so my hands are cold 
I was never the one who would be content with you 
I want more of you
I am greedy of you
I am naive and I won't share you
I don't care 
I want you 
Scared by fate 
Can I right my wrongs
I can't drink this feeling 
Scared by fate i wish there 
Was a healing 
Out of this 
Which leads me to you
As I am walking on a path of love
Jealous was never an issue 
What hurts me is what I did to you
Can I right my wrongs
But I can write my wrongs
So I 
Wrote this for you

3. The rough copy 

My last night was miserable 
I missed us realised I don't want you to leave 
I want you to be the one
The one I kiss while dozing off on my sheets
The one who holds my hand in movies
The one who caress my cheeks 
While my heart pounds 
And skips beats 
I want you and all of you
A new page or a book in your life 
The monents like stain of coffee on my shirt 
Which you loved
I wish we never grow apart 
My love grows every day, minute and hour
I wish you felt the same for me
I hope you still like coffee 
I really hope you still are the same 
The same I feel in love with 
I wish I am not your page but  your book
And not some rough copy 

Please let me know you really honest opinions and should I post on insta or not? 😓

1pwvyzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pwvyzo/crashing_because_of_crush/,Crashing because of crush,"Hi there,

first post ever so please bear with me!

So the general situation is that I've (M23) met a girl (F21) about a year ago who is studying in a similar field as I am.

We've had a few interactions throughout this year but nothing too meaningful but positive throughout. At the time I had no interest in a relationship so I didn't put much effort into it.

A few months ago I've felt ready for a relationship again and when I met her eventually it hit me like a  truck on a highway that's not going the speedlimit.  
My attempt on communicating my feelings was to bring it up in person but since we had no similar lectures and due to the size of the campus it was quite impossible to meet her naturally (I also don't know the lectures she takes). We also don't have crossing friendgroups or activities of any kind.

So after a couple weeks I've randomly met her in a bar (She was staring longer than necessary at me) celebrating someones birthday where I usually go with friends. Because of shyness I didn't dare to ask her out infront of the 12-ish people that were with her. Instead I went to them and talked to two of the guys of this group and also greeted her (She also said hi back but since we practically had nothing to do with each other I couldn't implement her into the conversation). After this I went back to my friends since my action was fruitless.

Later that evening I've sent a message stating my interest in her, saying that I find her attractive and would like to get to know her better over a cup of coffee or similar. Her answer to my approach was a very kind turn down, saying that she's just gotten out of a longer relationship and needs time for herself, hoping fo rme to understand that.

The hard truth would be #1 that it was a kind lie to state desinterest or #2 that it was actually true. Both leave me with only one action, which is to not put any ""romantic pressure"" on her whatsoever.

My issue is that I only wanted to get to know her to see if she's someone with a personality I'd like to date. From what I can tell she's a kind, intelligent and somewhat social person.

As a STEM-Major I at least fit the stereotypes a bit with my missing expertise in dating (one 2-year relationship prior).

Now the questions is whether it's appropriate to reach out again after a month of not a single interaction nor even seeing each other from afar. My idea was to ask whether she wants to partake in a study group I'm organizing regarding an exam we will both partake in. Or are there other things I could do to get to know her more without pushing boundaries?Or is it a lost cause an I should let it be?

I am genuinly so lost and rly in need of some advice from others since this has only been the second time in my life that someone fascinated me so much, which is why I don't want to fumble this up :') and this whole situation is just too distracting to remain unresolved.",1,1766835962.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1pwvudc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1pwvudc/my_grandfathers_5word_response_when_i_was/,My grandfather's 5-word response when I was disrespected changed how I view masculinity forever,"I was 19 when I first truly understood what respect means for a man. I had just started my first real job at a construction company, eager to prove myself among men twice my age with callused hands and weathered faces.

Three weeks in, I was the target of relentless comments from one of the senior workers Mike. He'd mock my technique, laugh when I struggled with heavy materials, and make jokes at my expense in front of the crew. Every day, I'd come home feeling smaller, the humiliation burning in my chest.

I remember sitting at my grandfather's kitchen table that Sunday, a man who had worked with his hands his entire life. After listening to me vent for ten minutes about the disrespect and my plans for an aggressive confrontation, he set down his coffee cup and looked me straight in the eyes.

""Respect is taken, not given,"" he said.

Those five words hung in the air between us. I waited for him to continue, to explain some elaborate plan for standing up to Mike, maybe even something physical. But he just sipped his coffee and let the silence stretch.

""What does that even mean?"" I finally asked.

""It means you're looking at this all wrong,"" he replied. ""You're waiting for him to hand you respect like it's something he owes you. But respect doesn't work that way, especially among men.""

He explained that I had two options: demand respect through confrontation, which might work temporarily but would position me as someone easily rattled; or command respect through my actions, which would change how people fundamentally saw me.

The next day, I arrived at the site thirty minutes early. When Mike started in with his usual comments, instead of showing frustration or firing back, I simply looked at him, nodded slightly, and returned to my work with deliberate focus.

At lunch, when the crew was sharing stories, I asked Mike about a technique I'd seen him use a genuine question about something he was clearly skilled at. His surprise was visible before he launched into an explanation.

For two weeks, I maintained this approach: arriving early, working with intense focus, acknowledging criticisms without emotional reaction, and recognizing the strengths of the very man who tried to diminish me.

By the third week, something had shifted. The comments had almost stopped. When I spoke in group discussions, Mike actually listened. One afternoon, when I solved a problem that had been slowing us down, he was the first to acknowledge it.

When I told my grandfather about the change, he nodded knowingly. ""You stopped asking for respect and started commanding it. Big difference.""

He went on to explain that true respect comes from three things: competence in what you do, consistency in how you show up, and composure in how you handle difficulty. ""Most men waste energy fighting for recognition when they should be focusing on being undeniably good at something that matters.""

That conversation changed everything for me. I realized that respect isn't about intimidation or dominance the things I'd associated with masculine respect. It's about becoming someone whose value is self-evident through their actions.

In the years since, I've found this principle works universally. When someone disrespects me now, I see it as information about them, not a judgment of me that needs defense. My response isn't to demand the respect I ""deserve,"" but to continue embodying the qualities that command it naturally.

My grandfather passed away last year, but those five words ""respect is taken, not given"" remain the most valuable lesson he ever taught me about navigating the world as a man.",36,1766835486.0,LockedInMan,3,0.97,False
1pwvu0j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pwvu0j,My humble collection and my top 3 picks,"Hey fellow Fragheads,

I have recently started building my own collection of perfumes, and needless to say, following this sub has fuelled this hobby to a good extent (my wallet disagrees).

This is my first time writing a review, so please excuse me if I’m not descriptive enough with it.

Anyway, to sum up my collection, here’s my top 3 picks:

1. Gucci Guilty EDP: I swear to god, this fragrance has my heart. It has a very distinct floral opening with a gentle hint of pepper (it’s perfectly balanced). A few months ago I was using a clone of this fragrance from a local perfumery and eventually got bored of this fragrance until I got the OG. Although it’s an evening wear and something you’d usually wear to a party, I still sometimes like to wear it to the office during day times.

Projection: 10/10 (definitely marks your presence however at the same time isn’t very loud)

Longevity: 10/10 (Lasts good 6-8 hours on the skin and days on clothes in Mumbai heat)

Overall: 10/10 no doubts

2. FW Royal Blend: This would be my number one, without question, if it would last a little longer.

It opens up very well and smooth. It gives off ‘cool drinking’ kind of vibe and is a heavy boozy scent (in a good way) which is very, VERY addictive. It’s seduction in a bottle for me.

Projection: 7.5/10 (projects well but fades away pretty fast)

Longevity: 7/10 (It lasts < 2 hours on my skin and 4-5 hours on clothes)

Overall: 9/10 (I’m giving this score with the hope that maturing the fragrance will help with the longevity)

3. CDNIM Untold: THIS! This here is an absolute beast of a fragrance. This is very, very close to BR540 and I absolutely love it. The saffron mixed with amber and jasmine, gosh this fragrance smells like how heaven probably would. The only drawback it you CANNOT spray more than 2 sprays. It will blind your nose but burn other people’s nose who will be unfortunate enough to find themselves in an enclosed space with you.

Projection: 10/10 (it is a nuclear bomb of a fragrance, just be careful not to annihilate the neighbours)

Longevity: 11/10 (you can sleep, sweat, shower and still smell traces of the scent)

Overall: 9/10

A few others I really love is: Tommy Bahama Maritime Deep Blue, EZE Magic (This fragrance is absolutely luxury especially when you check the price tag is only a thousand rupees), Odyssey Toffee Coffee and Asad Bourbon.

Feel free to ask me any questions you have and I’ll be more than happy to answer!",3,1766835451.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,3,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs
[And hopefully Snoo ](https://postimg.cc/B8vN5xJc)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

[WarEra.io],"Heyo everyone, we are trying to get the Indian community in WarEra.io, a geopolitical strategy MMO where players run countries, economies, and armies.
​Rn, the server is evolving fast. Other countries are forming massive alliances, establishing distinct economies, and taking territory. India has massive potential in-game due to our numbers, but we need more active citizens to actually become a global superpower.

WarEra is a browser-based (and mobile app) geopolitical simulator (maybe RTS too). It’s not a graphics-heavy shooter, it’s about Strategy, Politics, and Economy. Like a simplified, community driven version of eRepublik or Hearts of Iron but played in real-time with hundreds of other people.

​Real Politics: We have our own elections. You can run for President, become a minister of Defense, or manage the country's tax rates or even pass laws as a member of Parliament.
​War & Territory: We defend our real-world borders and can expand into neighboring regions. (Yes, we can conquer. Yes, it is satisfying. Yes, we've made Akhand Bharat.)
​Economy: Build factories, trade resources on the global market, and supply our soldiers with weapons and food, tip or make news articles and manipulate market with fake news.
​NO Pay-to-Win: This is the best part. You cannot buy your way to victory. Strategy and activity win wars, not UPI. Only IAPs are profile decorations.

And the best part, it can take 10 minutes a day, or 10hrs, all depending on how much you engage socially with community.
You log in, train, work at a factory, vote, maybe fight in a battle if one is active, and you're done. It’s the perfect ""coffee break"" game. But if you want intense debates, join the politics and fight all you want by words.

​We need people who want to:
​Soldiers: Just log in and click ""Fight"" to defend our borders.
​Economists: Players who enjoy market trading and supplying the army.
​Politicians: People who want to organize the community, create laws, and handle diplomacy with other countries.
​
How to join:
​Go to www.warera.io
​Select India as your citizenship.
​Important: Join the Discord (link inside the game). That is where the real planning, alliance talks, and strategies happen.

​Let’s show the server the strength of the Indian community. See you in the game! 🇮🇳

I’ve been with my GF (28F) for two years. In Toronto, she was a welcomed guest in my house. My parents treated her like their own daughter and showed her nothing but respect. For example, she has a medical condition that causes loud snoring and requires a CPAP machine, but she refused to use it. Even though it kept me awake at night, I never mocked her or made her feel bad because I knew it was medical.
In Toronto, our relationship felt balanced. She would pay for dates from time to time and we bought each other gifts. I am a student and I just finished my very last semester the same month we were in the Philippines. I actually received my final grades while staying at her house, but she didn’t even bother to ask about them. I never got to celebrate finishing college because the focus was entirely on her demands.
As soon as we arrived in the Philippines, I got incredibly sick. I was diagnosed with Acute Bronchitis and Bronchial Asthma in Acute Exacerbation. I was prescribed 7 different medications, including two antibiotics and strong steroids. I was struggling to breathe and in constant pain.
Despite being sick, I brought over $1,000 worth of gifts for her family. I bought my GF gold earrings that cost $600. When I showed them to her mother, her mother’s first question wasn't ""thank you,"" it was ""How much do they weigh?"" because she wanted to check the gold value. I felt ashamed even offering to buy coffee or small meals because the prices seemed so low compared to Toronto that I felt it wasn't a ""big enough"" gesture, even though I was already giving so much in other ways.
Instead of care, I was mocked. Her family giggled at me for blowing my nose or for my bathroom habits while I was sick. My GF started nagging me over a $5 7-11 bill, saying it was ""the least I could do"" after her parents bought dinner. She told me she was waiting for me to ""show a provider mindset"" by treating her whole family to meals.
The breaking point was when she showed me her phone. She had been talking to an AI to justify breaking up with me. She fed it a one-sided story, and the AI told her:
• My illness was a ""manipulation tactic"".
• Me feeling like an ""outsider"" was ""good for her breakup plan"".
• I was a ""bad guest"" who was ""sulking"".
After a massive argument where she insulted my mother, she told me to pack my bags and get out at 12:00 AM. Her parents hid in their rooms while I, a sick man who could barely breathe, had to lug two suitcases and a box into the street in the middle of the night.
She sent me a final text claiming she ""supported my life"" this trip, ignoring the two years we built in Canada. I left the gifts at her house and just flew back to Toronto. Am I crazy, or is this as cruel as it feels?",2,1766835077.0,ExNoContact,1,1.0,False

1pwvq6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1pwvq6n/comic_idea/,Comic idea,"I have some ideas for my comic... I've already planned the characters.

* Lioness-With-Mane: main character, a white lioness, who, however, was born with a mane. She is delicate, empathetic, and sometimes overly self-critical. She tries not to stand out, although the mane makes it impossible. Has a phenomenal memory for details (can remember what someone said six months ago). She likes to watch the stars and make up her own constellations from them. Terrified of spiders.
* Dingo: a friend of the Lioness, from Australia. Energetic, inquisitive, a little absent-minded. She speaks quickly, interrupts frequently, but is genuinely interested in the other person. She can fall asleep in any position and in any place. Knows hundreds of Australian legends and proverbs. Loves to collect unusual stones. She always carries a flask of eucalyptus infusion, a compass (even if she needs to go to a nearby store) and a notebook to write down ideas (90% are absurd). Easily amenable to impulse purchases.
* Hyena: Dingo's neighbour. An idealist with an exaggerated sense of justice. She speaks loudly, with a slightly raspy voice. She makes the best Turkish coffee in the area. She doesn't know how to accept help, so she always tries to cope on her own.
* Ram: Lioness's neighbor on the left, a pastor who lives with his wife, Ewe, and his son, Lamb. Kind but firm, he is convinced that compassion and understanding can transform society. He speaks deliberately, selecting his words carefully, and frequently cites Christian teachings. He always carries mints in his pocket (he offers them to anyone who is nervous), a miniature Bible, and a framed photo of his family. Freezes at the sight of wasps and bees.
* Ewe: Ram's wife. Kind, caring, with a quiet but firm voice. Knows how to listen and give wise advice. She never raises her voice, but her words always carry weight. Every Sunday she bakes raspberry pie by her grandmother's recipe. She grows flowers on the windowsill and gives them names. She dreams of opening a cafe, but is afraid to leave her family unattended.
* Lamb: Ram and Ewe's son. Active, inquisitive, with inexhaustible energy. He always asks questions and searches for answers. A dreamer who believes he can build a rocket and fly to the stars. He draws comics about his adventures, where he is a space explorer. A little unsure of himself, and couldn't find any friends at school.
* Boar: Lioness's neighbor on the right, a police officer. Conservative to the core. Appreciates order, schedule, and clear instructions. He is harsh on the outside, but in his heart he worries about everyone who is in trouble. He speaks in short phrases and avoids metaphors. Does exercises at 6:00 a.m., even in the rain. He loves to secretly watch romantic TV series, but hides it. He has a phenomenal memory for faces and details, and can remember who broke the rule three years ago and when.
* Saluki: Hyena's landlady. Restrained, but with a keen sense of humour. Tolerates Hyena's antics because she considers her an ""interesting person."" Conducts triple accounting (for herself, the tax and ""just in case""). Remembers every overdue payment with absolute accuracy. She drinks tea only from a cracked cup. She does not tolerate loud noises (covers her ears with her paws during thunderstorms).

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1pwvpud,https://www.reddit.com/r/Phoenix_2/comments/1pwvpud/phew_80_eh_is_this_when_meowtirement_turns_into/,Phew . 8.0 eh . Is this when Meowtirement turns into re-tirement?,"9 years played. 

44418949 Million invaders destroyed. 

747780 Missions flown. 

All upgrades, all Apexes

and a shit load of money spent on this game. 

Even though I don't play as much as I used to I still support the game/devs with a monthly VIP subscription as there was no other value-based way for me to pay for stuff as I had everything the game could offer and this game has provided me with unspeakable amounts of value playing it on my work travels etc - plus the friends / connections I have made through the discord server over this time. 

Im currently sitting at Level 287 (yes in the right groop and yes its the current highest level in the game for those that keep misquoting it as 267 or what ever)  - in ""meowtirement"" from chasing bobs/sbobs appart from the odd time when I blind clear and realise I'm in the top 5 and decide to go for it or what ever. Right now I am chasing to get to Level 300 and stop, at least that was my plan until now. Let me explain.....

  
I won't go into the major detail of some of the major changes from a build/game model perspective, other posters have already done that in great detail and I'll be honest, I don't fully understand it all yet either. I won't even go into it from a (former) speed runner / bob/sbob chaser as I have seen that alot are saying its effected that side of the game immensely. I'm coming at this from a pure ""in-game-experience"" point of view. 

  
Firstly, let me say to those that say shit like ""EL/The devs don't care about us/the players etc etc "". This is simply not true. I have been one of (if there are any other?) few players who have actually had the pleasure of meeting EL in person when he stopped over in Sweden to take time away on his family HOLIDAY to spend a few hours with me over a coffee, shoot the shit about the game and reminisce about our early gamer days from the late 90s and 2000s. Those in the discord have seen the pic of us at the end. I'm not a ""fanboy"" by any stretch but it was such a cool amount of time spent meeting the dev of a computer game that I played religiously. I wasn't even using the meeting to vent about my frustrations about the game, it was just a chance to catch up and meet face to face as we had messaged many times over the years. Naturally the conversation came to some areas of the game that frustrated me or needed improvement and he most definitely did listen because some of those changes have been implemented over the last few years. Heck, some of the more ""whingy"" wish list items I had told him that I honestly didn't think would happen, he kept me in the loop over the odd DM out of the blue saying ""he hasnt forgotten about X , we are looking at it"" which I honestly wasn't even expecting. One of the things I said to him - which has now (kinda) happened was ""give me a reason to spend more money on your game!"" (as at the time I had everything  that the game could offer) which leads to my next point....

2) - The company / devs NEED to have income otherwise the game will not exist nor HAVE these updates that we have had over the years to keep us there. Ive lost count at the amount of games I played years ago that I stopped, simply because there was nothing more. I was happy to drop money on apexes etc because I was fiercely competitive in the leaderboard stuff and I also had in the back of my mind that this is one of the best F2P games I have ever played and (not so much now) , if you WERE F2P , you could still eventually compete with the serious players/whales without spending a cent. So from a moral perspective, I will always support a company if a product of this value exists and I am GETTING so much value. Buuuuutt..... ""Give me a reason to spend more money on the game"" is now here..... and I don't like it. 

When previous updates dropped, I was ready to drop real money on what ever I needed to get instant upgrades / be the first to try (insert apex here) etc etc. The moment I clicked open on this 8.0 update (I was 24 hours after everyone else as i had no idea it had dropped (more on that later) I was met with instant confusion on what the fuck was going on - suddenly my ulted ships were..... no longer ulted. I only realised the game had actually been updated when I went to play VB on an armour mission, my kappa drive wasn't working and the missiles were black..... thats when I instantly went to discord and saw the commotion about the update. 

Further confusion ensued when I saw the mods, engrams, nova cores etc etc... and an icky feeling went into my stomach..... ""wow... EL has actually gone and done it""..... Ill ellaborate:

So Ive been addicted to Tower Defence games lately, I currently play 3 , I started with Rogue Defence then my algorithm showed me Galaxy Defence and now Planet Defence. I soon realised that these are all essentially the same game, same game mechanics, ecosystem all just with a different UI and graphics. 

I dropped a bit of money on them to try and level up fast but instantly realised that the money I spent was for very.minor.upgrades.... instant regret. The only thing I don't reget was buying the ""lifetime"" passes for each rather than a monthly amount, at least I get those rewards each month. But what makes me cringe are all the little micro transactions to get this mcguffin, that lead to the next mcguffin, to do this mcguffin, ooooh then ""forge"" these items together to maybe get the mcguffin I want. Its been a frustating labour of griding to get through the levels - I play the weekend events (Miss the weekend specialist events on P2) which even now I still don't fully understand due to the complex nature of the ingame ecosystem. 

I had a fleeting thought here and there the last few months while playing these games ""geeze its good that P2 was never this confusing. Ive even wondered over the years why EL hadn't gone down this path of monetization. Well.... the game screamed at me ""Badger, hold my beer here is 8.0""... 

  
So I open up the update and try to wrap my head around it ""right where I can I dump the 300k + credits I have accumulated so I can insta test out these new features... I was met with instant confusion and disappointment . Mods? Hang on, I have to now pay to get back some of the features I have had the last 9 years? ""Wait, let me find the shop how I can get the BEST ones""..... nope you now need  ""Nova Cores"" to do that.... ok let me find where I can dump my credits on those.... oh.. I have to pay for those - what do they do though? Let me go find some notes on how these work.... \*searches discord/release notes\*.... oh no one else knows either. So , not gonna spend money on something I don't understand.. but heck let's test out some of these mods that I CAN buy in the warp gate... so I do that and boy oh boy did I want to throw my already broken ipad at the wall as I 1) had to endure the warp gate animation spitting the mod at me THEN having to scroll down each time to purchase the next mod THEN when I actually equip these things (that was an experience working that out) I am then told by the stupid little helpful robot to ""here, equip your mod on this dot"" then ""dont worry Im friendly I can remove it when ever you want to"" animation over and over and fucking over again on each mod and ship I added to. I play around a bit and instantly notice the differences (not yet thinking positive or negative here, just ""cool, some new shit"" ). Then the engrams drop..... what in the actual fuck is this... no one can explain it to me , so I keep going then I realise after now reading some of the posts on here and discord, that its effectively gambling and (for now) its broken (duplicate mods etc etc) .  Just the experience gave me the ick as I instantly drew the experience of playing these tower defence games. 

So yep - They went there and changed the model to what it should be if you want to make the mullah like the other apps. Do I blame EL/Firi for doing this ? Not at all. They gotta get paid. But from an experience point of view / game model point of view - not so thrilled. Normally I would be reaching for the apple pay button and clicking that buy button on an update like this, but sadly not. ""Give me a reason to spend money"" was not there.   
  
Ill continue to play casually, log in here and there (the title was click baity yes) - definitely not chasing bobs/sbobs any more but sadly I don't think i will play enough to hit that level 300 mark. My initial calculations at my previous rate saw me get there in 1.5 to 2 years, but with only a few minutes here and there, not gonna happen.  Why? No incentive to speedrun any more and the grindy nature to get around the UI / ecosystem made me want to throw my ipad. 

  
Now, back to Planet Defence - got a weekend event to play.

1pwvmmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DryJanuary/comments/1pwvmmz/are_you_searching_what_is_aim_of_life/,are you searching what is aim of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1pwvlsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1pwvlsd/my_progress_following_dr_koufmans_detox_diet/,My progress following Dr Koufman's detox diet,"I can sleep flat again, yaay!!

As indicated on one of my post, I was diagnosed with H. Pylori in 2014. It was successfully treated with a 6 months treatment. About 2 years on I was diagnosed with chronic gastritis, that's when my hell started. I was on and off PPIs for 7 years of which 3 were everyday straight. In 2023 I had a series of serious ailments which doctors could not explain and failed to realize these were PPIs side effects. I figured on my own after tons of searching, I went cold turkey against my GPs advice who said I have to take Nexium for the rest of my life. That was in August 2024. 

I was fine-ish for a while until my Gerd started in December of that year. My throat was in constant pain, sinuses, ear ache, headaches, nose drip. At its worst everything made my reflux worse, even water. Nothing helped, wasted tons of money on trying this and that. I was ready to take cyanide to end my misery. 

One time I came across a comment here on reddit, someone was recommending Dr Koufman. I went to her YouTube channel which led me to her website. She specializes in Respiratory reflux AKA silent reflux /Gerd. She regularly does clinical studies. I followed her detox diet:

1.Elevate your bed

2. Drink alkaline water to neutralize the pepsin lodged in your tissues (sinuses, throat). Preferably with PH of 8 and above to dissolve the pepsin

3. Avoid acid meds(tums etc) they cause imbalance in your stomach, leading to more acid 

4. When I started I avoided carbohydrates:grains, legumes, nuts because they made my reflux worse. I ate boiled chicken with salt, eggs and crackers. Gluten and dairy are known to be inflammatory, avoid them. If you have no issues with carbs check her recommended foods on her website. Just type Dr Jamie Koufman, her info will pop up. 

5. Avoid eating constantly so that your stomach can rest, reflux is highly likely when your stomach is forever churning. I ate breakfast at 09h00 then dinner at 15h30,2 meals a day. 

6. Go to bed with empty, quiet stomach as gravity is impaired when you lie down. When I started My last meal was at 16h00. I lost tons of weight during this period but I would have done anything to feel better

7. Take Gaviscon advance aniseed always after food, it floats on top of your food during digestion so that it doesn't leak out. Take again before bed, then chew ginger root. I slept chewing ginger root  

8. I ate tons of raw ginger root, it made the pain so much better. Avoid coffees and teas, I only tolerate chamomile tea. Avoid dairy as well as it is inflammatory. 

9. Buy empty throat spray(I bought mine online, vey cheap) put alkaline water so that you can reach the far back of your throat to rinse off pepsin which is causing the issues on your respiratory tract. It belongs in the stomach, very dangerous when it's spills to outside tissues not created to handle it. 

10. Eat whole foods, ingredients added to processed food cause irritation when your digestive system is weak. She recommends eating a gum for salivating, I realized it caused me bloating, which leads to pressure on stomach, leading to reflux. Instead I still eat ginger root. 

12.ditch supplements, herbal teas and any other tons of things I know you have in your drawer, you want to figure out what works and what makes it worse. 

Remember that silent reflux/respiratory reflux/Gerd is because your stomach, LES, and throat  are inflamed. Almost anything will trigger your reflux, because the LES does not close properly and stomach contents leaks out, including the enzyme pepsin which is causing havoc on your tissues. Once the inflammation goes down and the LES is able to close properly you will be able to add back some of the foods that you enjoy. 

I followed this diet for about 2 months, I started to see a difference within 2 weeks. Today I am about six months in and I have never felt better. I did relapse many times due to adding back food early or some foods are still a No. I sleep flat, I have been eating frequently and randomly this festive season, and I am able to eat more food than when I started.I am now able to eat these foods I could not eat when I started: Hot sauce, chocolate, I now eat 90% red meat and tons of animal fats, sourdough, sodas in moderation and the best and Bizzare thing is that I can drink a whole 750ml of red wine or 3 cocktails in one sitting. For some weird reason my stomach immediately soothes after a glass of red wine. When I feel the heartburn coming I just drink red wine and I am immediately fine. I am still looking for why is this as I don't understand why alcohol makes my reflux evaporate. (remember that if you are in the throws of this illness, alcohol will make you worse. I am OK drinking because my LES, throat and my stomach are somewhat healed. Do not drink alcohol when you are still at worst.) 

  
Will I ever be ""normal"" again? My answer is No. Coffee, dairy, tea, too much carbs, beer, ciders trigger my reflux. Once it starts it takes 3 days to get it under control again. Sometimes it just acts out with no visual reason, sometimes I am able to eat something for a while and out of nowhere it triggers me. 

  
But I am over joyed that I am not in constant pain, I can eat red meat, drink a glass of wine and sleep flat again💃🥳🥳. Give it a try, you might get better as well. ",2,1766834604.0,GERD,2,0.75,False

Hi Cutie,

I hope you are doing well and having a lazy-cozy weekend.

I'm writing this to propose an idea - speed dating over this weekend. I don't mean 'making out before we know eachother's names' by that, hear me out. 

I usually am busy with something or the other every weekend and this weekend my cousins, friends, etc (who I usually chill with..) have one plan or the other. Then I thought why not do something interesting and fun.

My idea is to meet, spend time (in a public space - so that our kidneys are safe), see the vibe, have conversations, eat food, walk on streets and what not. If things go well, we can take it from there. It can be old school style where we don't even have to hold hands - intimacy is eyes' game anyways. We can figure out what we wanna do, in my DMs. 

About 'me and redditors' :
I've met some good people over here - I'll talk about 3 people:

1. I met someone in-person at 2 AM (purely sfw) - liked the conversations and comfort. Stayed real good friends for good amount of time with good conversations over her terrace and friendly dates. As humans, we wanted to do the deed for once - did it once and decided to limit it to just once. We rarely chat but not on bad terms at all, just life happened.

2. I met a cutie online and things are still online. Conversations with her feel real nice and we feel good things about eachother. If we ever meet, more than anything else, we might want to give each other a biggggg hug. It's all lovey-dovey over there and we support eachother emotionally when required. It's a half-romance, half-emotions scene over there - such a cutieeee she is.

3. I met a girl who lives 1.5 kms away from me coincidentally. If we are that close, we have to meet right. Yeah, we did. Just within our first day of talking, we met for breakfast/lunch. It was an hour affair we talked a lot of different things and vibed good. But, later realised that we expect different things from life. Still good friends is what I'd like to think. She's even gonna cook something for me soon(I guess). 

I wrote the above scenarios not to flex but, to show my internship experiences (references). I'd like to think I'm a sensible person who'd be respectful of what you want and be honest if things don't align - all the above girls would vouch for it, if they don't get creepy DMs after comments. I can do slow burn, fast burn or burning each other out ;). We can set the expectations over the DM, see where we stand and what can we get out of this weekend.

If you have come this far reading, I'm sure you might wanna send the DM too. Even if things aren't super aligned, we can at least have a good chat. See you on the other side.

ACROSS THE COUNTRY

The day had been a slow, grinding punishment.  
Emily Rose had written forty-three tickets, broken up two bar fights, and taken a punch to the ribs from a drunk who swore the stop sign was “a suggestion.” By the time the moon climbed over the precinct’s flat roof, its light looked thin and accusatory, sliding across the glass like a scalpel.

She pushed through the station’s side door, boots scuffing the tile. The air reeked of sweat, gun oil, and bleach. She dropped into her chair, let her head fall back, and closed her eyes for the first time in sixteen hours.

Then the scream came, raw, animal, ripping straight through the drywall.

Emily was on her feet before she registered moving. The sound came again, closer, from the lobby. She shoved past the duty desk, badge swinging, and burst into the night.

Delgado’s apartment smelled of stale beer and the ghost of cigarettes he swore he’d quit. The television flickered in the dark, volume low, just enough to let the anchor’s voice crawl under his skin.

“Gruesome discovery outside the 19th Precinct tonight. Sources confirm the victim is eight-year-old Anna Swinter, missing since.”

He didn’t need to hear the rest. He’d seen the head. He’d smelled the iron in the mailbox.

On screen, the parents stumbled out of a cruiser. Mr. Swinter clutching his wife like she was the only thing keeping him vertical. Mrs. Swinter’s mouth opened in a silent scream the camera lingered on for three full seconds. Three. Like it was art.

Delgado’s lip curled. “Sick fucks,” he muttered, tipping the bottle back. The beer was warm. Tasted like failure.

He’d been twenty when the first arrow appeared.

A finger in a matchbox. Mailed to a precinct in Baton Rouge.

Note: “tell mommy i tried to wave” ↓

Nine years. Thirty-seven packages. Forty-two victims, if you counted the ones they never found whole.

He stood, swaying, and hurled the bottle at the wall. Glass exploded. Amber liquid slid down the paint like blood.

“WHERE ARE YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH?”

His voice cracked on the last word. He punched the drywall, once, twice, until his knuckles split and the pain felt honest.

He slid down the wall, knees to chest, and let the sobs come. They always did, around 2 a.m., when the city quieted and the ghosts got loud.

His brother’s face floated up. Tommy, twelve years old, gap-toothed grin, always begging to tag along.

“C’mon, Ricky, just to the corner store. I’ll be good.”

But Ricky Delgado, twenty and invincible, had a party to get to. Girls. Music. A fake ID burning a hole in his pocket.

He’d told Tommy to wait on the stoop.

“Ten minutes, tops.”

Ten minutes became three hours.

When he came back, the stoop was empty.

Just Tommy’s sneaker, one lace untied, lying on its side like it was napping.

They found the first piece three days later.

A toe.

Wrapped in Spider-Man wrapping paper.

Note: “he won’t need these to run anymore” ↓

Delgado pressed his bloody knuckles to his forehead. “I should’ve stayed. I should’ve.”

The TV cut to commercial. A smiling family eating cereal. Like the world still worked.

He laughed, a wet, broken sound. “You took babies. Grandmas. That marathon runner in Denver. Cut her Achilles so she couldn’t finish. You mailed her feet to the finish line.”

He crawled to the coffee table, yanked open a drawer, and pulled out an evidence bag. Inside: a single playing card. The Queen of Hearts. On the back, in red ink:

find the rest before i find you  
↓

It had arrived last week. No postmark. Just slid under his door while he was at the gym.

He turned the card over and over, like the answer might appear if he stared long enough.

His pager buzzed. Rose.

He let it ring out. Then again. On the third try, he answered the pay phone down the hall.

“Yeah.”

“Delgado, it’s me.” Emily’s voice was tight, like she’d been running. “We got a hit. Print on the mailbox. It’s in the system. Old case, 1991, juvenile. Name’s redacted, but the file’s flagged ‘Arrow Task Force.’ Guess who signed the original report?”

He closed his eyes. “Me.”

“You were a rookie. You interviewed a witness. Kid saw a man in a station wagon. Gave a description. Then the file vanished. Someone buried it. There was a second file: girl, born without arms, case closed as ‘runaway.’ You never saw it.”

Delgado’s pulse thudded in his ears. “Give me the address.”

“Already scribbled it on the back of your pager message. And Delgado?”

“Yeah?”

“Bring your gun. This ends tonight.”

He hung up, stared at the Queen of Hearts, then at the photo pinned above his TV. Him and Tommy at the county fair, cotton candy stuck in Tommy’s hair.

He grabbed his holsters, badge, and the card.

“I’m coming, Tommy,” he whispered to the empty room. “I’m late. But I’m coming.”

The door slammed behind him. The TV kept playing. The anchor had moved on to weather. Clear skies tomorrow.

125 NORTH PINEWOOD TERRACE, 3:17 a.m., October 26, 1999.

The moon had slipped behind a bruise-colored cloud, and the bungalow on the ridge looked like a broken tooth against the sky. Delgado’s cruiser fishtailed on the gravel turnout, headlights catching the swirl of red-blue strobes already parked crooked across the lawn.

He killed the engine and stepped out. The air tasted of pine sap and old blood.

Two uniforms flanked the sagging porch. One of them, Officer Park, lifted the crime-scene tape without a word. His face was the color of dishwater.

“Detective,” Park muttered. “He’s escalating. Hard.”

Emily Rose emerged from the doorway, latex gloves slick to the elbow. Her ponytail had come half-undone; strands stuck to the sweat on her neck. She didn’t bother with hello.

“Inside,” she said. “You’ll want to see it before the techs start bagging.”

Delgado followed her through the splintered front door. The house had belonged to Nellie Parks, 78, “Neighborhood Hero” for knitting 1,000 blankets. Now it was a single, perfect tableau.

Living room: Nellie sat upright on her floral sofa, hands folded in her lap.

At first glance she looked asleep.

At second glance she was a quilt of herself.

Her torso had been hollowed, ribs splayed like wings. Arms and legs: her own: flayed to the bone in places, pinned to the cushions with upholstery nails. A knitted blanket draped her shoulders like a cape.

The head was missing.

On the coffee table: a bowl of soggy Cheerios in thick, dark milk. Ten feet away, on a plastic lawn chair, sat an infant. Pristine white onesie. Nailed to the chair through the palms with newspaper. Eyes open, filmed, fixed on the ceiling.

In the hallway: two severed child’s legs in a red plastic wagon, feet in glittery jelly shoes.

Another note, pinned to the wagon handle with a diaper pin:

don’t worry mommy i found them in the lost-and-found  
they were waiting for the 3:10 bus  
tell the conductor i said hi  
↓

Delgado felt the room tilt. He braced a hand on the doorframe.

Emily’s pager chirped. She checked the numeric display, face hardening. “Greyhound station downtown just got a package. Cooler. Addressed to ‘Daddy’s Little Helper.’”

Delgado stared at the jelly shoes. “He’s playing house. Whole damn country’s his dining room.”

Emily stepped closer, voice low. “We’re not chasing parts anymore, Rick. We’re guests at his table. And he just set another place.”

Delgado pulled the Queen of Hearts from his pocket. Flipped it so Emily could see the back.

Table for three. Bring the legs.  
↓

Emily met his eyes. “Clock’s ticking. Next course is already cold.”

Delgado holstered the card like a bullet. “Then we don’t keep him waiting.”

GREYHOUND DEPOT, DAWN

The depot smelled of diesel and wet cardboard. A single cooler sat on the baggage carousel, spinning slow, labeled: DADDY’S LITTLE HELPER: FRAGILE.

Emily stood with Delgado and Ramirez, forming a tight triangle. CSI had photographed. Now it waited.

Ramirez broke the silence. “Why’s he talking like a kid who flunked phonics?”

Emily didn’t look up from the note taped to the lid.

daddy i waited at the bus stop like you said  
but the driver said i need legs to ride  
so i gave him mommy’s  
tell him sorry they smell like milk  
↓

Delgado traced the arrow. “It’s not sloppy. It’s deliberate. Every misspelling’s a time-stamp.”

Ramirez frowned. “Meaning?”

“Meaning the day he learned ‘because’ was the day someone stopped reading to him.” Emily’s voice was soft, almost clinical. “He’s writing from the last grade he finished. Or the last one that finished him.”

Delgado nodded. “Look at the numbers in the Pinewood note. n125125125235pwts2. Not random. He’s counting something. Locker combos, bus routes, ages. He wants us to think it’s a map.”

Ramirez shifted. “Or he’s just screwing with us.”

“No,” Emily said. “Screwing with us would be silence. This is conversation. He’s testing if we speak his language.”

Delgado pulled the Queen of Hearts. Laid it beside the cooler note. Same ink. Same pressure.

Ramirez leaned in. “Wait. That card came to you personally?”

“Slid under my door. No stamp.” Delgado’s jaw worked. “He knows my route home. Knows I drink alone. Knows I still keep Tommy’s photo on the fridge.”

Emily’s eyes narrowed. “Every note references a ‘lost’ part. Legs in the hallway. Head in the mailbox. Now legs on a bus. He’s not hiding the bodies. He’s curating them. Like a kid leaving clues in a scavenger hunt nobody asked to play.”

Ramirez swallowed. “So the arrow.”

“Isn’t a signature,” Delgado cut in. “It’s a compass. He thinks he’s pointing us toward something we missed. Toward him.”

Emily tapped the cooler. “Or toward what he thinks we owe him.”

A tech wheeled the cooler away. The carousel kept turning, empty now, a slow mechanical shrug.

Ramirez watched it go. “If he’s stuck at, what, second grade? Third? Then the locations aren’t random either. Bus stops. Playgrounds. Schools with numbers in the address.”

Delgado’s pager buzzed again. Unknown callback: 555-0199. He showed Emily the screen.

did you find her shoes yet  
↓

Emily’s breath caught. “He’s at a pay phone.”

Delgado dialed the pay phone outside the depot. It rang once.

“Which pair?” he asked.

A childlike voice, crackling through the handset:

the glitter ones  
they still have playground dirt  
tell tommy i kept the left one  
↓

Click. Dial tone.

Ramirez stared. “He knows your brother’s name.”

Delgado’s voice was gravel. “He’s been reading my mail for nine years.”

Emily grabbed a marker, started scribbling on the evidence board. Columns: WORD CHOICE / AGE / LOCATION / ARROW DIRECTION. She underlined playground dirt twice.

“We stop treating the notes like taunts,” she said. “We treat them like diary entries. He’s regressing in public. Every scene is a page he can’t tear out.”

Ramirez hesitated. “So we… what? Profile an eight-year-old with a box cutter?”

“No,” Delgado said. “We profile the adult who never left that eight-year-old behind. And we follow the arrow until it points at the door he’s afraid to open.”

Emily capped the marker. “Starting with every elementary school in a fifty-mile radius. Bus routes that still run past them. Lockers with busted combos. We map the places a kid could hide and never be found.”

Delgado looked at the empty carousel, still turning.

“Then we stop looking for a monster,” he said. “We start looking for the classroom he never graduated from.”

Ramirez exhaled. “And if we find it?”

Emily met his eyes. “We ring the bell. And we don’t leave until he comes out for recess.”

SQUAD ROOM, MORNING

Six chairs scraped around a conference table that hadn’t been wiped down since the Reagan administration. Coffee had gone cold in Styrofoam cups; nobody drank.

Emily sat at the head, elbows on the table, fingers laced so tight the knuckles blanched.

Ramirez was opposite her, shoulders folded inward like a broken umbrella.

Delgado leaned against the wall, arms crossed, eyes on the floor.

The blood-spatter analyst, Nguyen, kept turning a single evidence photo over and over.

Two uniforms, Park and a rookie whose name no one could remember, sat silent, faces the color of printer paper.

On the table: a paper map of the county tacked to corkboard, push-pins in every color of grief.

Red for torsos.  
Blue for heads.  
Yellow for the pieces too small to identify without DNA.  
Green for the notes.

There were thirty-seven green pins.

They looked like a constellation no one wanted to name.

Ramirez’s voice cracked the quiet. “Everything looks… pale.”

He held a photocopy of last night’s note, edges trembling in his grip.

i made a snowman but he melted in the sun  
so i gave him new arms from the neighbor  
he still smiles  
↓

Emily didn’t look up. “We pulled forty-two parts out of one house. Forty-two. In one night.”

Her voice was sandpaper. “He’s not hiding anymore. He’s curating.”

Nguyen set the photo down. It was a child’s hand, palm up, fingers curled like it was waiting for a high-five. A crayon drawing had been stapled to the wrist: stick-figure family, all holding hands. One figure had no head.

Park cleared his throat. “News choppers were over Pinewood before we finished processing. Vultures.”

Delgado pushed off the wall. “They’ll run the footage on loop until ratings dip. Then they’ll blame us for not catching him faster.”

Silence pooled again.

Ramirez unfolded the note, smoothed it flat. His lips moved as he read it to himself, like a prayer he didn’t believe in.

Emily noticed. “You’ve been staring at that one for ten minutes, Ramirez. Talk.”

He startled, cheeks flushing. “It’s… nothing.”

“Bull.” Delgado’s tone was gentle, but it still cut. “Spit it out.”

Ramirez’s fingers worried the paper’s corner until it tore. “When I was twelve, I saw the first Arrow story on the news. A foot in a lunchbox. I thought… I thought it was the most perfect crime I’d ever heard of. Clean. No witnesses. Just the note and the arrow.” He laughed, a small, sick sound. “I decided that day I’d be a cop. To understand how someone could be that… precise.”

The room didn’t flinch. They were too tired for judgment.

Nguyen spoke first. “Precision’s a hell of a drug.”

Ramirez nodded. “I keep thinking, if I can just read one more note, ask one more question, he’ll tell me why. Like he owes me the answer.” He looked up, eyes glassy. “My mom said I was obsessed. That I needed therapy. Maybe she was right.”

Emily reached across, laid her hand over his. “He doesn’t owe us anything. That’s the trap. He wants us to beg.”

Delgado moved to the map, tapped a cluster of green pins near an old elementary school. “Every location’s within walking distance of a bus stop that hasn’t changed routes since ’91. Same year my first report vanished.”

Park frowned. “You think he’s circling the same neighborhood?”

“I think he never left it,” Delgado said. “We’re the ones who keep moving.”

Nguyen pulled a fresh sheet, started sketching. “Grammar regression, arrow vectors, bus routes, milk in cereal bowls. None of it random. He’s reciting a schedule. A childhood schedule.”

Emily stood. “Then we go back to school.”

Ramirez looked up. “Literally?”

“Field trip,” she said. “Abandoned elementary on Maple. Closed since ’92. Bus stop still active. Locker banks intact. We walk every hallway. We read every scuff mark like it’s another note.”

Delgado was already shrugging into his coat. “And if he’s waiting?”

Emily met his eyes. “Then recess is over.”

Ramirez folded the note carefully, slipped it into his pocket like contraband.

He stood, legs unsteady but moving.

“One more question,” he said to no one and everyone. “Just one.”

The six of them filed out, boots echoing down the corridor.

Behind them, the map stayed lit under the fluorescents, pins glowing like tiny, patient eyes.

PINEWOOD BASEMENT, LATER

Dogs lost the scent in a creek. Helicopter flyovers came back with deer. Every officer moved like they were underwater.

Then Ramirez’s voice cracked over the radio:

“Basement. Old root cellar. False panel behind the shelves. Kid’s here. Alive.”

They found her in a hollow beneath the house, curled inside a plastic toy box lined with Nellie’s blankets.

No arms.

No legs.

No eyes. Sockets sewn shut with pink embroidery thread.

No ears. Just smooth skin stretched over the holes.

The stumps were pale, hairless, healed.

Not cauterized.

Not scabbed.

Healed.

The antiseptic smell was fresh. Someone had cared for her recently.

Like the limbs had never been there.

Ramirez dropped to his knees. “Jesus… how long.”

Emily checked the pulse. Steady.

The child’s chest rose and fell in perfect, mechanical rhythm.

A faint smell of baby shampoo and antiseptic.

Delgado’s flashlight trembled. “These wounds are months old. Maybe years. He’s been… keeping her.”

The girl turned her head toward the sound of his voice. Blind, deaf, but aware.

Her lips moved. No sound. Just shaping a word over and over.

Emily leaned close.

“Mommy.”

Emily stepped back into the cruiser, locked the doors, and screamed until her throat bled.

Beyond the false panel, a narrow door, child-sized, painted sky-blue, stood ajar.

Emily went first.

The room beyond was no bigger than a closet.

Walls lined with pegboard.

Hooks.

Hundreds of hooks.

On them:

Children’s shoes.

Tiny socks rolled into pairs.

A single baby tooth on a red string.

Polaroids pinned like butterflies. Smiling faces, then the same faces with parts missing.

A mobile made of finger bones, spinning slow in the draft.

In the center: a low table.

On it, bodies.

Stacked like cordwood.

Small.

Some still in pajamas.

Some in school uniforms.

All missing pieces.

All arranged in a perfect circle, holding hands with what was left of their arms.

Emily made it three steps in before her knees gave.

She vomited against the wall, retching until there was nothing left but bile and sobs.

Delgado stood frozen in the doorway.

One officer behind him simply walked out, dropped his badge in the dirt, and kept walking.

Another sat on the porch steps and cried into his radio.

A third called his wife and quit on the spot.

Ramirez didn’t enter.

He just whispered, “This isn’t a hideout. It’s a museum.”

At the far end of the room, above the circle of children, hung a single sheet of thick art paper.

No yellow legal sheet.

No arrow.

No childish scrawl.

Just a portrait.

Done in charcoal and colored pencil, police-sketch perfect.

An old man.

Seventy-five, hair in a neat silver ponytail, round glasses catching the fluorescent light.

A gentle, grandfatherly smile.

Emily wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, stared up at it through tears.

“That’s Richard Jons,” she rasped. “Retired city engineer. Lived two blocks from the first drop. His face was in the 1991 file on the girl born without arms.”

Her voice came out raw, barely human.

TUESDAY, RAIN-SMELL

A single Polaroid appeared on Emily’s desk.

No envelope.

No prints.

Just the photo: an empty elementary school cafeteria.

Long tables.

One place set.

A bowl of cereal, milk still fresh.

A yellow legal note beside it:

lunch bell rings at noon  
bring your appetite  
table for one  
↓

The arrow pointed at the lens.

The school had been closed since 1992.

Address: Maple Street Elementary.

Same building they’d cleared twice.

They rolled in at 11:57 a.m.

Full SWAT.

Snipers on the roof.

News choppers kept at a distance by uniformed air patrol.

Delgado led the stack.

Emily behind him.

Ramirez brought up the rear, hands shaking so hard he nearly dropped his rifle.

They breached the cafeteria doors at 11:59.

He was already there.

Richard Jons sat at the head of the table, 75 years old, hair in a neat silver ponytail, round glasses catching the fluorescent light.

A china teacup steamed in his liver-spotted hands.

A double-barrel shotgun rested across his lap like a sleeping cat.

The room smelled of cinnamon and gun oil.

Officers fanned out, weapons up.

“FREEZE! HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!”

Richard smiled. Gentle, grandfatherly, the same smile from the charcoal sketch.

His voice was soft, perfect BBC English.

“Good afternoon, officers. You’re right on time.”

Delgado’s finger whitened on the trigger. “Drop the weapon.”

Richard lifted the shotgun, slow, theatrical.

Every muzzle tracked him.

He pulled the trigger.

Click.

Empty.

He laughed. A warm, rolling chuckle, like a bedtime story.

“Oh, dear. I always forget to load the punchline.”

The gun clattered to the tile.

SWAT surged.

Batons.

Boots.

Fists.

Someone’s knee found his spine.

A boot stomped his hand until bones cracked like kindling.

Richard didn’t scream.

He just smiled through the blood.

They dragged him out in cuffs, face swollen, still chuckling.

INTERROGATION ROOM 3

One table.

Two chairs.

Richard sat straight-backed, wrists zip-tied, tea stain on his cardigan.

Ramirez entered alone, closed the door soft.

“Hello, Richard Jons.”

“Hello, sir. How may I assist you on this beautiful day?”

Ramirez sat.

Leaned in.

“Why?”

Richard’s eyes twinkled. “Because I wanted to.”

Ramirez’s voice cracked. “Your backstory, Mr. Jons. Who were you? Why this?”

Richard sighed, theatrical. “You ask such complicated questions, young man. But I’ve grown bored of the game. Nine years is a long season. When I turned aggressive, you found me. Because I chose to be found.”

He leaned forward, voice velvet.

“I did it because it felt good. A sensation beyond language. Like cinema, like sculpture. Every cut, every note, every arrow… a frame in a film only I could screen. And you know it was beautiful. Everyone does. Art is the only honest confession.”

Ramirez swallowed, his throat dry, a shameful heat blooming in his chest. He shouldn’t feel this pull, this electric understanding, but the words landed like recognition. “It… it was good?”

Richard’s smile widened, blood cracking at the corners. “Oh, yes. Better than good. It was release. Pure. You know what I’m talking about, don’t you?”

Ramirez’s gut twisted with guilt, a hot, secret thrill he hated himself for. He leaned closer, voice dropping to a whisper no protocol would allow. “What did the arrows mean to you?”

Richard’s eyes gleamed, locking onto Ramirez like a shared secret. “The arrows was a symbol that i always was curious about this is why i used it as my symbol it was always a mystery when you knew the path but you dont knew what you was going to see when you arive there.”

Ramirez’s breath hitched, the answer burrowing into him like a hook. He should stop, should call it in, but the questions spilled out, weird and hungry, far from any interviewer’s script. “Did it ever… scare you? The first time?”

Richard chuckled softly. “Scare? No, child. It thrilled. Like opening a door you always knew was there but never dared touch.”

“And the kids’ voices in the notes… was that you, really you?”

“Every word. The child I never outgrew. The one the world forgot to feed.”

Ramirez’s hands trembled under the table, guilt gnawing deeper: he was enjoying this, the intimacy of it, the mirror held up to his own dark fascination. One more, he told himself, just one more before he ended it. “If you could send one last arrow… where would it point?”

Richard tilted his head, serene. “To the boy in you who watched that first news story and felt the spark. Right here.” He nodded at Ramirez’s chest. “You know what I’m talking about, don’t you?”

Ramirez stood abruptly, chair scraping, face burning with self-loathing. He’d crossed a line he couldn’t uncross. “I… know it was.”

“See? You speak my dialect.” Richard’s smile was beatific. “I did it for me.”

“Tell me about your life.”

“Born March 12, 1950, in a clapboard house outside Tulsa. Father: a drunk who loved me in slurred verses. Mother: a sad woman who stitched quilts to keep the silence warm. They fought like thunder, loved like rain. School was a coliseum of small cruelties. Children are savages with excellent aim. I still hate them. I ate cereal alone, walked to class alone, bled alone. No friends. No lovers. Only the mirror, and it never lied. I am still alone today.”

“How did it start?”

A shrug. “I don’t remember the first snap. Only the relief. Like stepping out of a burning house into snow.”

“How did you do it?”

Richard’s eyes gleamed. “Children trust a grandfather with butterscotch in his pocket. Adults trust routine: same jog at dawn, same bingo night, same unlocked back door. Muscle is irrelevant when you have patience and a bone saw.”

He lifted a cuff-chained hand, mimed turning a key.

“I never used my own vehicle. I’m a retired civil engineer: city contracts, county blueprints, maintenance schedules. I knew every municipal fleet, every school-bus rotation, every rental lot that kept spare keys under the visor. A different van, a different plate, a different life each time. I’d wear the city’s own coveralls, the city’s own gloves, the city’s own dust.”

A soft chuckle.

“No phone in my name. Pay phones, calling cards, cash. Hairnets, booties, Tyvek suits under the cardigan. I shaved in motel sinks with bottled water, flushed the blades. DNA? I left their DNA: stray hairs from the shelter, fibers from Nellie’s own blankets. You chased ghosts wearing the victims’ own clothes.”

He leaned in, voice velvet.

“I didn’t hide from you. I hid inside you. Every arrow pointed where I’d already been and I never go to the same place that I commit the crime.”

He leaned back, serene.

“You chased arrows I drew on the map of your guilt. Every note was a breadcrumb I placed on your tongue. The cafeteria? My curtain call. You never caught me. I retired.”

Ramirez’s voice was a whisper. “You’re proud.”

Richard’s smile was beatific.

“I am complete.”

The red light blinked.

Recording stopped.

Outside the door, Emily and Delgado watched through the glass.

Ramirez stood, legs trembling. He looked at Richard like a mirror and saw his own reflection smiling back: guilty, tainted, forever changed by the dialogue he’d savored in secret.

Richard Jons just sipped his cold tea, humming a lullaby no one recognized,

waiting for the needle that would finally give him the last frame.

SQUAD ROOM, EMPTY

Delgado sat alone under the buzzing fluorescents, the Queen of Hearts in one hand, the last yellow note in the other.

tell tommy i kept the left one  
↓

The paper trembled between his fingers. Not from fear. From heat. From the furnace that had been building in his chest for nine years, fed by every severed toe, every glittery jelly shoe, every butterscotch wrapper soaked in blood.

He had promised himself he wouldn’t cry again. He lied.

The tears came hot, silent, carving tracks through the grime on his cheeks. He pressed the note to his forehead like it could brand the words into his skull. Like it could bring Tommy back. Like it could make the world make sense.

But the world had stopped making sense the day his brother vanished from that stoop.

Richard Jons was going to die.

Not by needle. Not by some sterile state ritual.

He was going to die wrong.

He was going to die slow.

He was going to die looking into the eyes of the man he’d been haunting since 1990.

Delgado stood so fast the chair rolled back and crashed into the wall. Metal on tile. A gunshot in the quiet.

He didn’t feel his feet move. He was already in the kitchen of his apartment, the one that still smelled like stale beer and regret. The note went into the sink. A flick of the lighter. The flame kissed the corner. The paper curled, blackened, screamed in silence as it turned to ash.

He watched it burn until the last ember died.

Then he opened the drawer. The one with the false bottom. Inside: his service pistol, cleaned and oiled the way Tommy used to clean his toy cap guns. He loaded it with hollow points. One in the chamber. Five more in the mag. Enough.

The drive to county lockup was a blur of red lights he didn’t stop for. Sirens off. Badge on the dash. No one pulled him over. Cops recognize their own when they’re past the point of return.

At the gate, the guard—Martinez, rookie, still had baby fat on his cheeks—looked up, saw Delgado’s face, and didn’t ask questions. Just hit the button. Didn’t buzz anyone.

“Room’s yours, Detective,” he muttered, eyes on the floor.

Delgado didn’t answer.

The hallway smelled like bleach and despair. Fluorescent tubes flickered like they were trying to warn someone. No one was listening.

He pushed through the steel door.

Richard Jons sat at the metal table, wrists chained, ankles bolted to the floor. His face was swollen from the arrest: purple bruises blooming under the glasses, lip split, one eye half-shut. But he was smiling. Still. Always.

“Detective,” he said, voice soft as lullabies. “I was hoping you’d come alone.”

Delgado didn’t speak. He closed the door. Locked it. The click echoed like a round being chambered.

Jons tilted his head. “You look tired, Ricky. Like a man who’s been running in circles. Did you bring Tommy’s sneaker? I kept the other one, you know. In a box. With the laces still tied.”

Delgado’s hand came up slow. The pistol was steady. Black. Heavy. Real.

Jons’ smile didn’t falter. “You’re not going to shoot me. You’re a good cop. You follow rules. You—”

“This one’s for Tommy,” Delgado whispered.

The first shot took him just above the left eye.

No warning. No speech.

Just the roar. The flash. The smell of cordite and copper.

Jons’ head snapped back. The chair tipped. Chains rattled. His body slumped, still tethered, blood pooling fast and dark across the table, dripping onto the floor in perfect, rhythmic drops.

Delgado stood over him. Breathing hard. Watching the light leave those monstrous, twinkling eyes.

He pressed the muzzle to Jons’ heart and fired again. And again. Until the slide locked back empty.

Silence.

He dropped the gun on the table. It landed in the blood with a wet thud.

Alarms started wailing somewhere far away. Boots pounded. Voices shouted.

Delgado didn’t move.

He just stared at the body. At the ruin. At the end of nine years of arrows.

And for the first time since he was twenty years old, he felt the weight lift.

Not peace.

Not forgiveness.

Just done.

The door burst open behind him.

Hands grabbed him.

Shouts.

Cuffs.

He didn’t resist.

As they dragged him out, past the flashing lights and the cameras and the screaming headlines waiting to be born, he looked back once.

The arrow was finally broken.

And Tommy wherever he was could finally stop running.

Hi coffeelovers,

After six years with my Eureka Mignon silenzio. It's time to replace my first grinder. 

-My coffee machine is already upgraded and this is a Lelit Bianca V3.

-I drink mostly medium roasted beans. 
Espresso for me. Milk for my girlfriend or friends.
Sometimes pourover (1 time a month, cleverdripper)

-Budget is max 1000 euro's. If it's possible, how cheaper, how better. But I want something to last. 

So now the search for a new grinder is hard. 
I want to focus on zero retention. My silenzo was 2 grams and not very fast to clean.
So It think I need to search for another brand than Eureka.

I already found:

-DF83V, in budget and kind of good reviews.
-Timemore 064s or 078s, in budget but some reviews are not so positive.
-Mazzer Philos, over budget but is this worth the € 300 more than they DF83V ?


Thanks in advance for your help, other grinders are also welcome.",1,1766833646.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1pwvat2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pwvat2,Inside Asia’s Largest Starbucks: A Visit to the Shanghai Reserve Roastery,"I recently visited the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Shanghai, often called the largest Starbucks in Asia, and it truly feels more like a coffee theme park than a café. Located on Nanjing West Road, this massive multi-story roastery combines coffee roasting, artisanal baking, immersive design, and interactive experiences all under one roof.
Inside, you’ll find a fully operational coffee roastery, a huge copper roasting cask, rare Starbucks Reserve beans, and a bakery offering freshly made pastries inspired by both Western and Chinese flavors. There’s also a cocktail bar serving coffee-infused drinks, making it a unique spot even for non-coffee drinkers.
What impressed me most was the atmosphere—industrial, modern, and almost museum-like—yet still welcoming. It’s extremely popular, so expect crowds, especially on weekends, but it’s definitely worth a visit if you’re in Shanghai and interested in coffee culture, architecture, or unique travel experiences.

1pwv92g,https://i.redd.it/qar1rw3haq9g1.jpeg,Struggling Economy in 2025 Despite Trump’s Promises,"Trump promised a stronger economy at the start of 2025. Yet workers continue to face high prices and rising unemployment.

Details. Employment growth slowed in 2025 and is trending toward 0%. Trump’s deportations have removed roughly 750,000 migrants from the labour force, while expanded AI adoption, mass layoffs, and economic uncertainty continue to threaten millions with unemployment.

► Average inflation reached 3%, while prices for key goods (e.g., coffee) rose by over 10%. The Consumer Price Index peaked in September at 324.8, up from 315.61 in December 2024, indicating a significant increase in the overall cost of living. Meanwhile, 83% of hourly workers have less than $500 in savings, and minimum-wage workers ($7.25/hour) now live below the poverty line.

► The national debt rose from $36.22 trillion to $38 trillion, with the budget deficit hitting $1.4–1.8 trillion. Most spending cuts targeted social programs, while about $1 trillion was allocated to the military.

► 60% of Americans remain concerned about the current economic situation. Recently, Trump acknowledged failing to address these problems, lower prices, or secure jobs, yet blamed former President Biden for the situation.

Context. Trump’s campaign and administration centred on promises of a “Golden Age” following Biden’s predictable failures to resolve capitalism’s contradictions. Promises of tax cuts, job creation, and lower prices were paired, once in office, with selective data and rhetoric designed to mislead workers.

► Amid these promises, 52% of American voters supported Trump primarily because of the economic solutions he proposed.

► Trump promised more affordable housing and healthcare. While rents and some drug prices fell slightly, high mortgage costs and limited healthcare coverage remained.

► In November, the White House highlighted selective price declines and real wage gains measured from an inflation-depressed baseline as “big progress,” concealing the permanently higher cost of living for workers.

► In December, the administration claimed “100% private-sector job growth,” and for “native-born Americans — NOT illegals,” meaning all new jobs recorded were outside the public sector, while failing to mention that overall job growth remained weak.

► The administration presented the One Big Beautiful Bill as reducing spending and national debt for Americans’ benefit. In reality, it increased deficits, prioritised militarisation, and shifted the burden onto social spending cuts.

Important to Know. The outcomes of Trump’s rule are predictable. His economic agenda advances the interests of the American capitalist class. Tax cuts, deregulation, tariffs, militarisation, and selective interventions all protect capital and increase profits while transferring costs to working-class households.

► Trump’s program is also conditioned by global economic stagnation. The World Bank describes the current period as the slowest growth since the 1960s. Falling demand sharpens the imperialist crisis, intensifies inter-capitalist competition, and compels heightened exploitation and conflict to defend capital accumulation.

► Workers face intensified exploitation, higher living costs, and limited access to affordable housing and healthcare, whilst a bipartisan ideological offensive was launched against the broad left, with communists being targeted as a result.

► The Democrats gained popularity by promoting populist left-wing candidates, such as Mamdani, to exploit Trump’s unpopularity, promising to “fix” capitalism through moderate reforms – just as Trump promised a “Golden Age” amid Biden’s failures. By advocating reforms that leave private property and capitalist accumulation intact, these reformists advance the stability and interests of the capitalist class, not the working class.",2,1766833285.0,Politsturm,0,1.0,False

Day 1 was the absolute worst, with jitters and feeling like I was going to fall over... but I made it through. Although I strangely didn't develop a headache... or a seizure like I did when I last tried to quit coffee (pre-Carnivore). Just goes to show how much this diet heals.

That said, I'm still kinda tired all day; I have the energy to do things, but it's somehow difficult; I've often been tempted to grab some more coffee, just so I can not feel tired. I was only drinking .5-1 servings per day, so I guess I got off easy as far as most side effects still. If anybody has any advice (aside from more electrolytes, already have those) I'd appreciate it.

Also, one unexpected side effect of quitting is... it seems it's more difficult to bother me, and I stay calmer. I noticed this when the our obnoxious apartment neighbors weren't absolutely drive me up the wall like they usually did. But other things just mildly annoy me or make me only hesitate for a split second.

Then as we were winding down for the night, my husband pointed out earlier that he'd noticed it as well (referencing something both distressing and gaming-related that would be too difficult to explain here). It's an interesting concept.

Initially, I was only planning on giving coffee up for a month and see how I feel then... but we both agreed that it'd probably be for the best that I continue on my Carnivore journey caffeine-free.",4,1766833185.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

(Or a different model?),"So, a few weeks ago, I got into looking at upgrading from my current, still functional, Keurig. (A single brew, compact model.) Partly because I was just not getting anything close to what I'd get from, say, Starbucks.  (Brew vs Shot aside.) And, due to a couple of factors, I've come to the conclusion I must be more of an espresso gal than brewed.

  
So I went perusing for something that would come close to an espresso machine, without the excessive noise or babysitting. (I had an espresso maker years ago. Learned how to use it to supposedly reduce the scream, and what not. Still hated it.) Started with a broader search than Keurig. Then ended up back in Keurig-only searches.

  
Came across K Crema, even before I ever saw an ad. 😅👀 I thought this would be perfect. Or close to it. The extra pressure feature meant it would be closer to espresso. Probably as close as I'd get​ without a true espresso machine. 

  
Did my reading/ research, and ended up getting one on Black Friday. It came about a week later, and I did all the ""pre-flight checks"" you're supposed to. (Cleaning, rinses, etc.)

  
First cup... was perfect. 👌🏼 Was very happy with the result. But after that? Blech. So bitter. Like how could it be \*that\* different? Same filtered water, same brand/roast of pod, same settings as the first. So, I tried other variations/combos of pressure and oz. (Didn't bother with classic.)

  
Haven't had a cup as good as the first since.

  
Then, what do I find today? 

  
The K Supreme Plus... with seemingly similar options. And from what I'm reading now, between them, the Supreme is... well, supreme. 😅😫

  
I have until the end of January to return it if I want to. So Keurig peeps who have tried both...

  
Which is better for the purpose of getting as close to espresso as possible, without an espresso machine? (Or is there another Keurig better than either at that?)

  
\-OR-

  
Have you experienced this, the great first cup, followed by bitter/ poor ones after... and found a solution that fixed the issue while keeping the machine (Crema) you got?

  
HELP A GAL OUT! 😵‍💫😭 I can't do Starbucks as often anymore, partly because of finace... but also distance. (30 minutes away now, vs less than 5.)

I hope you can enjoy this real, short-to-long story of mine and of someone I've encountered this year who changed how I viewed life outside of what I know is normal. Here is chapter 1 out of 28.

**Chapter 1: The Coffee Break Encounter**>!​!<

There’s a certain stillness before dawn — the kind that belongs only to doctors and the sleepless.

It’s in that quiet hour, when the world still dreams, that my day usually begins. The smell of coffee blends with the antiseptic scent of the hospital corridors, and somewhere between the heartbeat monitors and hurried footsteps, another day unfolds exactly like the one before it.

That was my life.

Predictable. Purposeful. Exhausting.

In this rhythm, there was no room for surprises. My world was built around routines — ward rounds, late-night calls, cafeteria meals shared with colleagues who lived in the same cycle of fatigue and caffeine. We laughed about the same things, complained about the same shifts. It was a comforting monotony until one day, life decided I needed a pause.

It came disguised as a badminton game.

I almost didn’t go. It was a rare day off, and all I wanted was sleep. But a friend insisted — \*“Come on, you need this.”\* So, I went.

That’s where I saw her.

She wasn’t the loudest in the room, but somehow she filled it. The kind of person who carries sunlight with her — warm, easy, impossible to ignore. Her laughter rippled through the air, light as wind, and when she smiled, it was as if the whole court tilted toward her. There was nothing forced about her; she was naturally radiant, as if joy found its favorite person and decided to stay.

Our first encounter was nothing extraordinary — a few polite smiles, casual introductions, an exchange of smashes across the net. I didn’t even know her name right away. Yet something about her stayed — a flicker in the background of my thoughts, like a melody you can’t name but can’t forget either.

Weeks passed. Life went on. Until, as if the universe was gently teasing me, we met again. Same game. Different places. Same laughter that somehow felt familiar now. And again, there were no long conversations, just quick glances, playful exchanges, and the kind of quiet electricity that builds in the spaces words can’t reach.

By the third encounter, fate had made its point. I found the courage to add her on social media — a small, impulsive decision, yet it felt like a heartbeat skipping for the first time in years.

And then, it happened — a message, a joke, something silly enough to start everything and yet meaningful enough to change everything.

That was the moment my life — my carefully measured, disciplined, predictable life — began to shift.

The hospital lights, the monotony, the exhaustion — they all faded into the background as something unfamiliar started to grow between us.

I didn’t know it then, but that was my coffee break — a brief, beautiful interruption in the middle of my everyday chaos. A moment that would remind me what it feels like to \*be alive\*, to \*feel again\*, and maybe, just maybe… to \*fall in love\*.

I’ve been with my GF (28F) for two years. In Toronto, she was a welcomed guest in my house. My parents treated her like their own daughter and showed her nothing but respect. For example, she has a medical condition that causes loud snoring and requires a CPAP machine, but she refused to use it. Even though it kept me awake at night, I never mocked her or made her feel bad because I knew it was medical.
In Toronto, our relationship felt balanced. She would pay for dates from time to time and we bought each other gifts. I am a student and I just finished my very last semester the same month we were in the Philippines. I actually received my final grades while staying at her house, but she didn’t even bother to ask about them. I never got to celebrate finishing college because the focus was entirely on her demands.
As soon as we arrived in the Philippines, I got incredibly sick. I was diagnosed with Acute Bronchitis and Bronchial Asthma in Acute Exacerbation. I was prescribed 7 different medications, including two antibiotics and strong steroids. I was struggling to breathe and in constant pain.
Despite being sick, I brought over $1,000 worth of gifts for her family. I bought my GF gold earrings that cost $600. When I showed them to her mother, her mother’s first question wasn't ""thank you,"" it was ""How much do they weigh?"" because she wanted to check the gold value. I felt ashamed even offering to buy coffee or small meals because the prices seemed so low compared to Toronto that I felt it wasn't a ""big enough"" gesture, even though I was already giving so much in other ways.
Instead of care, I was mocked. Her family giggled at me for blowing my nose or for my bathroom habits while I was sick. My GF started nagging me over a $5 7-11 bill, saying it was ""the least I could do"" right after her parents bought dinner. She told me she was waiting for me to ""show a provider mindset"" by treating her whole family to meals.
The breaking point was when she showed me her phone. She had been talking to an AI to justify breaking up with me. She fed it a one-sided story, and the AI told her:
• My illness was a ""manipulation tactic"".
• Me feeling like an ""outsider"" was ""good for her breakup plan"".
• I was a ""bad guest"" who was ""sulking"".
After a massive argument where she insulted my mother, she told me to pack my bags and get out at 12:00 AM. Her parents hid in their rooms while I, a sick man who could barely breathe, had to lug two suitcases and a box into the street in the middle of the night.
She sent me a final text claiming she ""supported my life"" this trip, ignoring the two years we built in Canada. I left the gifts at her house and just flew back to Toronto. Am I the asshole or is this as cruel as it feels?",1,1766831981.0,AITAH,25,0.53,False

Rejoicing with Alastor when it is working. Like, I am still not over the fact that it laughed out loud.

From being angry along with him to the calm delight in showing that the balance of power is now on their side.

Just my appreciation for the only character that loves Alastor more than Alastor loves himself. The best familiar that someone with hyperindependence could have. I couldn't find all the screenshots and gifs that I needed, but I really wanted to make an appreciation post for Alastor's shadow. ",36,1766831723.0,Alastorcult,2,0.98,False

Have Sage / Breville Barista express at home which I’m loving. Devouring James Hoffman’s Atlas of Coffee book at the moment. 

I live near Dublin which is a city with a fair amount of great coffee shops and independent roasters. But I’m still sufficiently novice enough in my coffee knowledge journey to be sure of how to differentiate between an average coffee shop and a great one. (Apart from merely saying “I like ththe coffee here”) Are there any telltale universal signs of a quality espresso bar/coffee shop?

I’m thinking: 
- stating the type of beans being served  and name of roasters etc, no piles of nameless giant bags of beans hidden under the counter 

- staff willing to discuss bean offerings and staff who actually know what I’m talking about when I ask for guidance on how to dial the beans they sell into my machine

- [could be wrong here??] offering coffee brewing products for sale, coffee accessories etc?

- [could be wrong here??] main purpose of the business is coffee, not food, fancy brunch offerings etc

Anything else? Type of grinder, type of machine? Any brands of grinder or machine that immediately should make me scream “run away”?? 

Posting this mostly for fun but real curious to see if there’s any real differentiators of quality out there, especially in cities overrun with cafes and roasters.

We are a small Asda petrol station that used to be a co-op, co-op never opened on Christmas as it was the one day of the year we were allowed off. Asda decided we needed to be open which is fine. But then they fail to put enough staff on. 1 team leader and 1 CTM as they ""cant afford to put more on"" this was the real issue when we recieved over 130 deliveroos, just eat and uber eats orders. From a store that is used to a maximum of 45 (even that is on a busy day). On boxing day aswell we only had two people working from 8 until 10 pm the time where ALL other shops are closed for the holiday. Of course we were doing orders for the entirety of those two hours while trying to clean the coffee machine and serve customers in between making us leave 20 mins late.
Why open on christmas day if you cant put the staff on for it. Its not fair on the people that have to pick up the slack.",14,1766831709.0,asda,8,0.9,False

I’ve recently started a small, low-key weekend hangout community (coffee, walks, food, casual activities). It’s been going well and people have been showing up, which is great.
One thing I want to do better from the start is make sure the space feels comfortable and inclusive for everyone, especially women. For that, I’d genuinely love to have a woman involved as a co-organiser / volunteer, so it’s not just being run from one perspective.
This is not a job, no money involved — just:
Helping shape plans
Giving feedback on what feels comfortable / what doesn’t
Occasionally helping coordinate meetups
If you:
Like meeting people IRL
Care about safe, respectful social spaces
Want to help build something from the early stage
Feel free to DM me. Happy to explain more and answer any questions.",0,1766831567.0,BangaloreSocial,1,0.25,False

Can it already be causing side effects or just placebo?,"So, I'm very certain that a lot of it was placebo, but i took sertraline 50mg for the first time yesterday at afternoon (3:00 PM), it being my first ever experience with an antidepressant, and since then I already had felt some things.

It started with a sort of sleepiness and a very subtle feeling of being ""high"" within an hour after taking it and I was yawning a lot the whole day. By the night I've got a little headache (passed quickly), brain fog, jaw tension and pupil dilation; by the end of the night a little bit euphoric, again, similar to being high but without the most ""trippy"" aspects.
When it was time to go to sleep, despite feeling sleepy and being fisically tired because I went out, I had a little struggle, got to sleep late and today I woke up early without an alarm feeling kind of anxious in my body, with a feeling in my chest and subtle tremor in the hands, similar to when I drink coffee (which I'm very sensible when it comes to anxiety).

Can the side effects happen so quickly? The thing I'm most confused about is the sleepiness vs. agitation/increase on anxiety thing, because I was told to took it in the night if I've felt sleepy and in the morning if agitated but I think I've got both and idk how to adjust the time to took the medication lol",1,1766831291.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False

I do my best to write reviews which others would find useful. This is especially true where it’s something like a coffee machine or a vacuum cleaner where I will test the product over a number of days or even weeks and try to use all the different settings and  attachments. All but two of my reviews have been rated as excellent.

  
When I look at my review page and check the helpful votes, the most I have is 3 in recent times, I have the odd one which has one or two and by far the majority have zero. I am not that bothered as I am clearly doing something right to have been invited into the programme in the first place, but if you are someone who consistently gets loads of hearts for your reviews, what do you think the reason for that is in particular? Are most people like me with just a handful of hearts? Or am I in the minority?
