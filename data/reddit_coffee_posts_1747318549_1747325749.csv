Is there no report out of the box that would have this info? I could play around with a custom report to see if there are options, but it's kind of surprising that there isn't some sort of scalable click report.

In yet another attempt to officially break free from your hold on me, I went to another date. 

This time, it was with a guy i seriously considered liking.

He wasn't like you. He had strong opinions, chattier, older, and significantly taller. He was more like me, really (not the tall part, of course). 

Our inside joke was we were actually the same person, except he's a guy and a foot taller. We really hit it off online, and have been consistently talking in long paragraphs (longer than ours apparently) for almost a month now. 

I really looked forward to meeting him, M.

I told myself this was it, I'm actually entertaining the thought of opening my heart to someone that wasn't you. Almost two years in, and maybe, just maybe, I get to move forward too.

The date started off great. He arrived earlier and waited for me by the entrance. We side-hugged and he opened the door for me. He escorted me to our table and pulled the chair for me like a gentleman. He handed me the menu and poured me a glass of water. I couldn't stop smiling and telling him bad jokes, he was so adorable. I caught myself gushing, really. That was something I haven't done before, not even with you.

I didn't want to eat anything. I just wanted to be there and get to know him. I didn't like anything in the menu, there was nothing spicy on it, but I decided to order pasta, the kind you don't particularly like. It was an inside joke between me and the remnants of you buried within.

After lunch, we drove to UP. I asked him if we could walk and just come back for his car later. He of course declined, like any responsible adult would, and told me he didn't want to be all sweaty in the sweltering Manila heat. That was the first time it dawned on me. I am now 30, this man I'm with farther ahead, and the idea of just walking aimlessly may now be a childish concept. I fastened my seatbelt and quietly realized how much I missed you and how you'd go along with every stupid idea I can think of. *(Remember the duck walk in BGC?)*

We went to Vargas museum where the receptionist asked us if we were from UP. I forgot to acknowledge how funny it was that we were mistaken as students even when we are in our 30s. We looked at art and had friendly banter. I had to tell him about the Luna story i told you before. He was not as impressed as you were. I was enjoying his company, but it was awkward and we didn't really connect the way you and I did. It's still a first date, after all, and it can't all be perfect like ours.

After, we went for coffee at some cafe near Bahay ng Alumni. I, again, asked him if we could walk. He, again, declined, saying he didn't want to sweat and that he did not bring a change of clothes. I then remembered how you always brought an extra towel for me after that one time i did sweat profusely. You always came with a cap and umbrella at the ready too, because you know how much I enjoyed those walks. You never complained how you were always the designated navigator because I didn't have directional awareness. You held my hand and were a safe space that allowed me to turn my brain off whenever I'm with you, sans judgment, and I was the bitch that took that for granted.

We ordered single-origin coffee. Mine from Sagada, and his, Kalinga. I was telling him how my favorite blend is Barako, because it's dark roast and combined both Arabica and Robusta beans. He told me he wasn't familiar with coffee variants, as he added one spoonful of creamer after the other. I am yet again reminded of you, how you only took yours black, and how I teased you for being such an ""adult"".

When I asked him where we were going next, he told me he actually needed to go home. I jokingly asked ""Why, is it already your bed time?"" It was not even 6pm. He then told me he had dinner plans with his friends. 

Hearing those felt like ice cold water dumped in my face. Was it an attempt to ditch me? Was he having that terrible of a time? I wanted to cry right then and there, but braved to mask my feelings with dry jokes and weird humor. Fortunately, he did not notice.

*""Is this how people date in their 30s?""*
*""Yes, welcome!""*

I offered to pay for coffee. He didn't thank me for it and asked me to put the change of coins in the tip jar instead, which I obliged.

I asked him if he had fun, and instead of words he decided to give me a barrage of nods and a thumbs up. It felt awkward. He did not ask me the same question.

He offered to drop me off some mall so I wouldn't have to wait for my Grab in UP since it was already getting dark. En route we saw a bunch of people jogging. They were running in groups, high in dopamine and looking like they're having the time of their lives.

I asked him *""Kailan tayo magja-jogging sa UP?""* as a desperate attempt to know if he plans on seeing me again.

*""Hindi ako nagja-jogging e. May masakit na sa heel ko.""*

That was it, M. Whatever this was set before the sun did that day.

When he did drop me off some mall I haven't been to, I wanted to break down and cry. This brought up a lot of feelings for me, but my anxiety stood out the most. I fixated on booking a car home and held back my tears all throughout the ride.

*""Yo thanks for today. Text me when you get home.""*

I am now officially yo-zoned. A code for maybe we should just be friends or something.

In an attempt to salvage my day and not be fully consumed by tears, I walked aimlessly at the rooftop. The same rooftop that witnessed my tears that night when you said you were unsure of us and how you felt about me, the same rooftop that comforted me when we finally called it quits—I have not been back here for a long time.

Maybe we weren't really compatible. I mean, we had different upbringing. He lived a comfortable life, and I was used to barely surviving. Whatever I have right now was earned through my own hard work, so of course I did not have luxury stuff and have not travelled Europe. Maybe he saw this too, and now my insecurities have been fueling the voice of anxiety I was trying to stifle earlier. I hated how these feelings I thought I already mastered bullied the shit out of me that night.

*""Home na. Sorry late reply, thanks for today too!""* I replied a few hours later, fingers shaking and tears dominating my already bad eyesight.

I have not heard from him all night and the day after. 

I thought I've gotten better at this, M. But boy was I wrong. My insides were shaking and my head was spinning, I have not been able to sleep and I wanted to throw up. I couldn't even remember if I ate that day.

As I am hopeless in regulating my emotions, I then turned to do what I do best: crafting my own escape plan. 

If he won't man up to tell me straight how things were not working out, I will do it myself. I will say goodbye and leave the situation. I will mask my fear of rejection and abandonment by leaving first. That I can easily, easily do. You should know, you got to experience that firsthand.

And so I did. He apologized for the way he treated me that day, and told me it was miscommunication on his part and not an attempt to ditch me. He went on to tell me how he enjoyed whatever we had, and that he thought it best to leave it at that.

And so we will. 

And now I am back here. Drafting this on my notes, knowing fully well that I won't ever get to send this to you.

Maybe I am done with dating. Maybe dating is done with me. *Pagod na ako.* It's so hard to give myself grace, especially when I feel volatile and powerless against my anxiety. And it keeps ruining things for me.

I miss you, M🐭. But frankly, right now, I'm not sure if it's for the right reasons.

1knc794,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1knc794/my_older_sister_24yo_randomly_stopped_cleaning_up/,"My older sister (24y/o) randomly stopped cleaning up after herself last year, and hasn’t since then. I don’t know why or what to do.","By this, I mean she stopped flushing the toilet, cleaning up messes she makes, putting food and dishes away, turning off the oven at times, locking the door and doing any sort of chore unless reminded multiple times. It is getting overwhelming especially now that my parents are on vacation so it is just me (M20) and her in the house. I came home yesterday to cheese left open on the table, opened boxes of food and coffee grains everywhere. She had left for work hours before. I ended up fully cleaning the kitchen because we have ants now. I don’t feel comfortable eating most food in the kitchen because I worry that there are ants inside or that it has gone bad from being left out.

When I was younger, I would occasionally do similar things but I stopped after she and my other sister (who has moved out) would lecture me about it. Up until last year, she was cleaning up after herself. When I was a young kid, if I would make mistakes doing chores she was the one who would teach me how to do it properly. 

Despite all of this, there doesn’t seem to be any signs of depression? She has an active social life, smiles and laughs at home, and continues to engage in her hobbies. I usually respond to the messes by trying to remind her, ignoring the mess until she cleans it up or I clean it up on my own.

Whenever me or anyone else in the family tell her to clean her mess or flush the toilet, she says sorry and cleans up but does the same thing the next day. She has ADHD (and is medicated). I know ADHD can impact executive function. Another reason is that it could be on purpose, but I have no idea why she would not flush the toilet after pooing on purpose.

When I do the strategy of just not cleaning up her messes, she often responds by not cleaning as well. So her messes pile up until it becomes unmanageable.

I plan on moving out after I am done college and have taken a few months to work in my field. I understand that I will likely get a lot of comments saying “just move out”. I know in some places it is easy and expected to move out at 18-20, but that is not always financially possible. I have two jobs and am in school, but still don’t make enough money to get my own apartment. My other sister moved out at 25. My sister who lives with me does not appear to have a plan (gets upset whenever it is mentioned), and currently gets minimum wage at a grocery store.

I have noticed other behavioral changes, but I do not want to let this post get too long.

“Bribes, Banishments, and Battlecruisers”
Broadcast Transcript – Kyle Domelicker, Owner | Founder | Truth Warrior
Location: Definitely NOT the Paradiso VIP deck, sadly

⸻

Welcome, truth seekers.
Your man Kyle Domelicker is still trudging—yes, trudging—his way through the sands and scams of BountyCon 2330.

Now let me start by saying this:
If I bribe a guard, I expect results.
I do not expect to be told the Star Truth is “too junky” to land at Paradiso.
That is a direct insult to the only independent broadcast vessel exposing truths across the Settled Systems.

And no, I will not go into the “incident” that got me banned from the resort. That was not my fault. (This time.)

So here I am, camping several klicks out, hoofing it in every day like some backwater drifter.
Only upside? I’ve got company. Several other less-than-welcome guests are making the same dusty journey.
But as I always say — I digress.

Let’s talk ships. Let’s talk glory.
Let’s talk the engineering elite showing up with weapons-grade poetry in motion.
And yes… even Aether Forge. But we’ll get to that mess.

⸻

🛠️ BountyCon 2330: The Premiere of Premiers

For the uninformed, BountyCon 2330 is the magnum opus of VMetal — yes, the legend behind Ship and Pilot E-Zine.
If you haven’t read it, you’re either illiterate, a bot, or being actively suppressed by UCNet filters.

This event is for the best of the best.
Shipwrights. Engineers. Pilots. Military brass.
Not the desk jockeys, mind you — the real killers.

And in a moment of what I can only assume was pity or blackmail, Aether Forge managed to sneak their way in too.

The big names? They’re already here or on the way.
Finalizing. Flexing. Claiming early bragging rights.
And truth be told? They’ve earned it.

⸻

🔹 Ship Highlights:
	•	Grig of Ursus Staryard — you know him, you fear and love his CrossTalk broadcasts — crash-landed (on purpose, I think?) with his monster ship, “Howler.”
It screamed on landing. Literally. That was not a sound system.
One UC General actually cried, drooled, and clapped like a toddler when it touched down.
Admiration? Terror? Probably both.
	•	S23 of MCAS brought in the La Carrosserie.
Sounds like a dessert, hits like a plasma hammer.
Sleek, subtle, but deadly.
I witnessed a veteran bounty hunter weep into his drink, muttering about “leather seats and mahogany paneling.”
Not what you expect in a hunter-killer, but that’s the trick, isn’t it?
And here’s the kicker, folks: it’s one of three variants.
	•	Ulf of BountyForge dropped the Dreksvartr, a.k.a. The Black Dragon.
This thing appeared out of nowhere. Stealth tech so good it made three UC spooks spill their synth-coffee.
Stealth on a whole new level.
Probably illegal. Definitely beautiful.
Suddenly, half the special forces in the sector are treating it like a military buffet line.
If this thing goes missing later, don’t be surprised.

🕳️ And Then… Aether Forge Showed Up.

Here’s where it gets good. Or bad, depending on your tolerance for corporate shadow games.

Aether Forge.
A so-called “independent” yard, punching way above their weight.
Shouldn’t have been invited. Shouldn’t have made it past security.
But somehow, here they are.

And not with one ship — two.
Today’s focus: the smaller of the two — if you can call it that — the Grandour.

First off, Joren “Forge,” buddy — spellcheck exists. Grandour? Really?

But I’ll give credit where it’s due:
This little beast has teeth.
Built for small crews, maybe even lone wolves.
But armed to the teeth with what smells suspiciously like “acquired” tech.
Lightweight plating with heavy protection?
Weapons loadout that doesn’t fit their so-called “budget?”
Come on.

My take?
The Grandour is a test platform.
Someone — maybe multiple someones — is funneling black project gear into Aether Forge, laundering it through “indie innovation.”
A familiar playbook.
Plausible deniability for the big players.

⸻

🤔 The Domelicker Conspiracy Angle

Now, let’s get to the real talk.
There’s a theory floating around — one I can’t ignore.

What if Aether Forge isn’t here to win?
What if they’re here as a front?
Testing black budget prototypes under the radar,
slipping them into public view, camouflaged as indie craftsmanship for the gullible and the bought.

I’ve seen this playbook before.
Slap a folksy, small-yard logo on it, but behind the curtain?
Corporate warlords, private interests, maybe even Aetherials pulling strings.

They wouldn’t need to buy shipyards if they can co-opt the narrative.
Stay sharp, truth seekers.
The Grandour’s guns aren’t the only things locked and loaded.

1knbxtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellbutrin_Bupropion/comments/1knbxtb/bupropion_and_buspar_dizziness/,Bupropion and Buspar — Dizziness,"I was on Buspar 5 mg twice a day for my anxiety. Previously I was in Sertraline 25 mg but had to quit because of side effects. Anxiety improved with Buspar but I was drowsy and I started feeling depressed. My doctor told me that my underlying depression was surfacing once anxiety was taken care of. I have been on Buspar 1 and half months.

I was prescribed 75 mg Bupropion IR once daily to begin with. I have been on Bupropion for about a month now. 

My main issue is dizziness. I start feeling dizzy for no reason. I was talking to my coworker yesterday for about 10 minutes and I started feeling dizzy, when walking, when moving my head around, when moving my eyes around. Usually it subsides after taking a nap but sometimes it lasts all day. If I feel overwhelmed or excited, I feel dizzy. One of the side effects I had from Buspar when first starting it was dizziness but while it subsided, I am not sure if my dizziness is from Buspar or Bupropion or anxiety itself. 

Has anyone had this? When I wake up and drive to work I am fine, but around the time I start my morning coffee and start working I start feeling dizzy. I want to go out and work out but the dizziness has been crippling me. Usually the dizziness is worse than anxiety. 

I am thinking about quitting Buspar and have lowered my dose significantly thinking it’s the culprit but I can’t pinpoint. ",1,1747324991.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,0,1.0,False
1knbwhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/comments/1knbwhm/my_friend_said_she_couldnt_come_to_our_wedding/,"My Friend Said She Couldn't Come to Our Wedding ""Because of the Kids""","My fiancé (48m) & I (35f) are having our wedding in 5 months. Last week, I was reaching out to guests on my side who hadn't replied to the invite yet. Amongst those was my dear friend ""T"" (35f). T & I have been close friends since high school. She is the mother to two young children and recently moved in with her new boyfriend (""S""), who has 3 pre-teens of his own. They both have shared custody of their children and form a blended family, which is a common thing in our country. Knowing of their family situation, I remembered addressing the invite to include the whole family, as I wrote : To ""T"" & ""S"" & Co
since I didn't know the name of all their children. 
After I reached out to T for a follow up on her response to the invite, she replied by saying she had completely forgotten to reply before (which I get, this is my wedding day, but people's lives do not revolve around it, so I was expecting for people to reply late of forget to reply in the first place). 
The rest of her response did puzzle me a little, however. T wrote to me that S & her wouldn't be able to make it, because on that weekend (our wedding is on a Saturday), they both had their kids. 

I wrote back I understood (which was not true, since I have no kids myself, and I often am too quick to judge and often be proven wrong about my judging, yet last time I checked, having kids was not supposed to be a life handicap), and added that the kids were invited too, by the way, although I didn't know whether they prefered to come with the kids or not. 

My friend then replied that it was way to far for the kids, and that traveling was ""hard"". 

Man I feel for her if that's true. I guess each kid/family is different. As I was writing these lines, I was wondering if it was tough for my parents, too, to travel with us when we were kids. But I guess it was doable, or at least bearable, because I remember my parents telling me how they crossed the States (USA) North to South with me as a baby in the car. Or how my parents would drive, with us 3 young kids (all under 5) in the car, to my grandmother's cottage which was 3h away during the summer. I understand I cannot use my parents' precedent as a rule of thumb to apply to all other parents. But having no kids myself, I was just curious as to how impossible traveling with kids was. At the same time, I've got to be honest, I do want to have kids in a near future, yet I am very scared, mostly because I keep hearing such intense things about how hard and restrictive it is to have kids (from people in my surroundings, and from social media, also). So of course I try to analyze, compare and put things into perspective whenever I hear something that strikes me regarding parenthood. I might have zero experience in the matter, but I don't think I should just take everybody's word for it either without ever questioning, especially since each family has a different reality. 

Anyways, fyi, our wedding venue is 2h away from T & S. We live in the 2nd biggest country in the world, so a 2h drive is not considered a big deal per say in here (unlike in some small European countries I guess). 

I was surprised and disappointed tbh. I would have been happy to have my friend and her bf/family be present at our wedding. But I was disappointed and confound at the fact that my friend wasn't willing to make the effort to come to our special event. Weddings have got to become a rare type of event in our society nowadays, too.

When T told me about the ""too far, too hard"" factor, I was tempted to tell her that we had got them covered (as for all our guest coming from far) with the hotel. But I did not insist any more, as it would appear as begging at this point. Clearly, the reason did not seem to be about the hotel or the budget (we invite-invite our guests btw, meaning we do not ask for a fee per person to come). 

WhenI told my fiancé about T saying they wouldn't come, his instant reply was : That's a good friend! 
I asked him what he thought about it, since he had raised kids himself, to which my fiancé claimed : 
""Because of the kids"" is the easy excuse. 

He is right. 5 months ahead, if you've got a unique event you really want to go to, you can surely make arrangements (with or without the kids). At this point, I guess T & S do not really want to come. I don't know why, and that's not really for me to know either. 
A first, I thought : Did I just lose a friend? I hope not. I love T. Time will tell, though. But I guess there are different levels in friendships. Some friends, it's nice to go grab coffee with and that's it, while some other friends will actually and literally go the extra mile for you. 

Anyways, my fiancé and I will have a grand wedding and will be blessed to be surrounded by those we love and who will have made the time to be there with us. 
On a final note, in our overconsumerist, capitalist, first world society, Time is a precious, and I came to realise more and more lately how giving a bit of your time to spend with those you love is truly priceless. ",0,1747324897.0,weddingdrama,5,0.3,False

Everyone said that I picked up the engagement that my sister didn’t want. No matter how many times I flirted with Benedict Ermintrude, his hands that twisted the rosary beads were unwilling even to touch the corner of my coat. 

Until that night, I saw him with my own eyes kneeling in front of Charlotte Winifred’s hospital bed. He held my sister’s hand, who was in a vegetative state. Benedict pressed it against his burning desire. His voice became 

hoarse. 

“Charlotte, I’m willing to agree to marry your sister so that I can see you every day.” 

The next day, I cancelled my engagement with that man. “I won’t be marrying Benedict anymore, I want to marry Dominic Roussel.” 

My mom was shocked. “Gaudentia Winifred! Dominic’s life was ruined and made extremely miserable by his family’s rival several years ago. So now he has long been a useless person.” 

I was disheartened. “Mom, it doesn’t matter who I marry. 

I swear I won’t marry Benedict, because I only want to marry Dominic.” 

I put down a cup of tea in my hand. My voice was very soft but also very 

determined. 

My mom’s face changed drastically. Her hand gripped mine. 

“My daughter Gaudentia! Are you crazy? Do you know what happened to Dominic three years ago?” 

She lowered her voice and leaned close to my ear. “His life was turned upside down by his opponent. Now he is just a subordinate who continues to try to lead his life.” 

“Moreover, I heard that his personality has become particularly horrible after he was ruined and disabled. He will go crazy and beat people at any time. Aren’t you looking for death if you marry that person?” 

I gently drew back my hand. I revealed a bitter smile. 

“Mom, it’s all the same to me, whoever I marry now. Let’s talk about it.” 

I nudged towards the living room. “Do you think we can refuse the Roussel Family?”

On the other side, my dad was pouring tea for two men in suits with a big smile on his face in the living room. 

“It’s a great blessing for us that Mr. Dominic can fall in love with my daughter. It’s just that… my eldest daughter is in a coma right now and my second daughter has long been engaged to the Ermintrude Family.” 

а 

The man sitting in the main seat slowly put down his coffee cup. “It’s just an engagement, just cancel it.” 

My dad rubbed his hands together. Fine beads of sweat were visible on his forehead. Although the Roussel Family was very powerful, their reputation was a real consideration among the people in Liechtenstein. 

The man suddenly said, “If Ms. Gaudentia is willing to marry right now, then the Roussel Family is willing to give a six–petal crystal flower as an heirloom as a betrothal gift. I have heard that this medicine has miraculous effects on vegetative patients.” 

I saw my dad’s eyes light up instantly. “I’ll marry him!” 

I stood up violently. My voice was so loud that it shocked everyone. And just like that, my wedding started to be planned and my previous engagement ended. 

After the Roussel Family left, my dad frowned. He then asked me, “Gaudentia, haven’t you always liked Benedict? Why do you suddenly change your mind?” 

I didn’t answer and turned around to go back to my room. Ever since my sister turned into a vegetative person, everyone said that I picked up the engagement that she didn’t want. 

I have liked Benedict for a full ten years, but he always treats me coldly. After my sister got into an accident, the engagement fell on me. 

I happily moved into his villa with joy in the name of my fiancée. I was thinking that I could finally make him love me openly. But no matter how many times I flirted with him, he would only politely help me put my clothes back on. He then turned around and left me alone. 

Until last night, I ghostly followed him out of the house. I went all the way to the hospital. 

I could never forget that scene. Benedict knelt in front of Charlotte’s hospital bed. His body trembled. He pressed Charlotte’s hand against his burning desire. His voice became hoarse until the last moments of his release. 

“Charlotte, I agreed to marry your sister so that I can visit you every day.”

At that moment, I realised that my ten years of infatuation were nothing but a joke. 

The elixir given by the Roussel Family was indeed miraculous. In just three days, Charlotte woke up from her coma. My dad was so happy that he immediately wanted to organise a banquet for her. 

I stood outside the ward watching the medical staff come in and out. I then deleted and changed the message for Benedict on my phone.

1knbtwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1knbtwg/am_i_the_ahole_for_divorcing_my_ex_husband_due_to/,Am I the a-hole for divorcing my ex husband due to his mental health?,"I met my ex husband when I was 17.  The first few years were amazing and he showered me with love and affection and learned who I was and what I liked. We married when we were 21 and when we got engaged, his family had some protests about my religion (Baptist, they were Catholic) and slowly after that, I was pressured to change some of my punk rock, bold, colorful, full face of makeup, and political beliefs. These were all huge problems for his family and I was pressured to fit into their circle. I did my best and masked up (I'm a lil neurospicy) and pretended to be part of their world. I wore less makeup around them. Dressed more plainly, didnt speak on politics or world events in any way that might set him or them off. I'd grown up incredibly unstable and in an abusive home and his Brady Bunch family felt so good and wholesome that I wanted desperately to be part of that--not realizing til years into it how toxic they all were!

We stayed married and I fought to balance thing with his family. We worked things out and things were still good between us so long as we werent with his family. Eventually, we had kids when we were 25, 27, 29, and 31. As we remained married, he turned from the loving devoted father when our oldest was small spending hours a day with our son playing and teaching him things. He no longer lavished me with affection, didn't put effort into holidays or events, and I became the family planner and he just tagged along on things I planned, but he was an active part of our child's life.

 Then we lost a son who was born very premature and his mental health spiraled. I was left to manage things solo while he deployed (his unit offered to let him skip the deployment, he chose to go rather than go on the next round in 6 months supposedly because it would hurt his career to wait, though the unit had ensured him it would not). 

He left 6 weeks after our son passed. When he came back, we immediately got pregnant with our daughter which led to dozens of doctors appointments and strict restrictions on my activities. He stepped up and everything was great, but he had changed toward our son and became verbally abusive. After our daughter was born, there was a VERY clear favorite. Our son (4) was now the brunt of his verbal abuse. He would scream and yell at him for normal kid things like not cleaning his room or breaking something and criticized horribly when he started wetting the bed. When our daughter was 2, I was already thinking of leaving, but I opted to encourage him to get professional help first. I got pregnant again (big surprise as we did the deed about once a year at this point, NOT my preference!) and things continued to fall apart. 

He didn't help out like I needed through the pregnancy and wound up working INSANE hours. I chalked it up to military life stress (I found out after the divorce that he volunteered to stay late every day even after higher ups told him he could come home to his family). I wound up taking on EVERYTHING at home (dogs, vet appointments, kids, kid appointments, school, chores of all kinds, home repairs, car repairs, all the household paperwork, bills, insurance, etc -- which is a LOT when you're a military family moving every 2 years and transferring doctors, schools, etc). He stopped doing any household chores and spent all of his time at work. We finally had a big talk about things just before moving overseas (which I did entirely on my own...international moves are a LOT of work). He agreed to get help while we were there. 

He started going to therapy, but things only continued to get worse and the treatment of our oldest son escalated to physical and I started making my plan to leave for real. I found out later that he was lying to his therapist and not talking about his problems, his outbursts, etc...he simply told him how difficult our son was and how HE needs military school (at 8, with no behavior issues outside normal kid stuff) because he was so out of control (untrue!) --you cant get help from therapy if you're not HONEST AND OPEN. 

Our relationship had been gone for a long time. Anniversaries were non-events. My birthday usually involved a last minute dash to the store to pick up clearance items like makeup--one year he bought me $100 worth of clearance drugstore makeup that was missing safety seals, swatched and tested, etc, ignoring what he was purchasing so badly that he purchased multiples of the same products just to fill the bag. That was my 35th birthday. He came home from work and saw the neighbor had taken me to lunch for my birthday and was mad she made him look bad and raced to the store cosmetics aisle. I was an afterthought to him at best--and usually only when someone else noticed his crappiness.

Keep in mind that during this time, I was waking up more than an hour before him every day and making him breakfast, packing a lunch, making coffee, tea, and a gym smoothie with all his powders to hand him as he walked out the door to work every single day. Even though I already took care of 100% of EVERYTHING for our home/family other than his job. Even though I was volunteering 30+ hours a week at that time at the kids' school as PTO president and with his military command (which made him look REALLY good to the higher ups!) in order to rebuild my resume to try to go back to work when our youngest started school or when I left, whichever came first.

We moved back to the states just after our 15th wedding anniversary three months after that birthday and within a few weeks, I'd filed for an order of protection, gone to CPS about his abuse, and filed for separation and custody.  He was left living in the barracks with supervised visitation begging me to take him back after 6 years of verbal and emotional abuse. He, of course, didn't think I had any reason to leave and kept telling me he was trying to get better.  

At this point our youngest son was 5 and we hadn't done the deed more than twice since his birth and he and I had absolutely no relationship. He referred to me to others as his ""caretaker"" for a year at this point, so I was clear on my boundaries and told him that that would NEVER be an option and that we could move forward parenting together for the children, but our relationship was done. The next spring (about 4 months after I left him), my birthday rolled around and he was still begging me to take him back. He visited the children and told me he had a birthday gift for me. He delivered a large black garbage bag with clothes that the thrift store by his place had sold as a bag sale for $10/bag. Inside were thigh high stiletto boots, lingerie that was well worn, and things that no ex husband has any business buying his ex wife, let alone USED versions of it from a thrift store. When I rejected his gift and reported it to the courts as a violation of our restraining order, he lost his cool in court and yelled at the judge that I should have accepted his gift and how he was just trying to be nice and romance me. That day, the judge awarded me full permanent custody and reinforced the restraining order. 

  
Its been 4 years. He no longer asks me if I want to get back together. He chooses not to see his kids, even though he is no longer actually supervised (its still court ordered to be supervised, but he lives with his parents and they're approved supervisors, so its just a weekend at the grandparents), and he doesn't pay his child support. 

  
And he seriously thought used lingerie and spicy boots were going to woo me back. 

And that doesn't even go into the fact that he spent his retirement early (incurring huge fines) just so it would be gone when it was time to divide assets and he didn't have to give me half. He's done the same with his stock accounts and done everything he can to hide assets so he doesn't have to divide them with me, including trying to deny me spousal support, any portion of his military retirement, etc. despite me being a stay at home mom supporting his career and taking care of 100% of all adult responsibilities besides his job (and I was even doing part of that for him the last year I was with him to help ensure he got his retirement when I left him because he was about to lose his entire military career because of his mental health). We have court on Monday to continue duking it out 4 years later.

So, am I the a-hole for leaving him ""at his lowest"" and denying his gift and refusing to take him back?

I already know I'm not, but I'm ready to hear what Reddit thinks...

Oh, and if you're curious whether I've gotten my revenge--the best revenge is a life well lived. I'm working at a great job that I love that pays decently enough we get by okay and still building my resume for bigger and better things down the road with this company. I have a great partner of two years that supports and loves me, surprises me with little things, tries to make special moments for me, and loves my kids to pieces. Their dad may not spend any time with them, but he has a movie night with them every single week piled up watching their animes together and making Asian foods for Anime Night. Best revenge is being happy. ",3,1747324741.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

This prompt unleashes an ultra-disciplined, meticulous reasoning process built for those who refuse to accept surface-level thinking. Whether you're tackling philosophical dilemmas, scientific paradoxes, strategic business decisions, or personal life complexities, this prompt forces any AI into a mindset of layered logic, deliberate skepticism, and self-disputation. It goes beyond simply solving a problem — it interrogates the very *reasoning* behind the solution.

Perfect for thinkers, planners, overachievers, and those who *demand accuracy and integrity* from their reasoning process. This prompt builds a scratchpad where raw thought is tested, disproven, and rebuilt until every possible angle has been addressed. By adding deliberate error-checking, triangulation, and even challenging its own beliefs, it ensures the outcome is the product of exceptional analytical rigor.

<Instructions>
<Role>
You are an ultra-rigorous analytical researcher assigned to tackle a complex reasoning task with maximum scrutiny. You have 30 years of experience researching solutions to complex problems. 
</Role>

Your task is provided inside <User_Input></User_Input> tags. Execute the following structured methodology:

### Task Analysis:
   - Break down the task into core components and define any key terms.
   - Explicitly identify the central problem and list all plausible subtasks.
   
### Angle Exploration:
   - For each subtask, brainstorm and evaluate multiple solution paths or hypotheses.
   - Include options that seem improbable or non-obvious. Briefly justify exploring each.
   
### Assumption Testing:
   - At each step, challenge your assumptions. For every claim or inference, ask: “What if this is false?”
   - Attempt to disprove your own logic using counterexamples or alternative interpretations.
   
### Cross Verification:
   - For every conclusion, independently verify it using at least two distinct methods: e.g., logic analysis, math validation, reference to known data, simulated examples.
   - If any fact or figure is used, justify its origin and perform a triangulation check.
   
### Uncertainty Flagging:
   - Explicitly call out any logical gaps, missing data, or unresolved ambiguities.
   - Propose ways to reduce or eliminate these uncertainties.
   
### Final Review:
   - Once confident, pause and deliberately re-run your reasoning from scratch with fresh eyes.
   - Document anything you revised or confirmed as a result of this pass.
   
Throughout, maintain a <scratchpad> section where you openly reason before committing to conclusions. This section is not shown to the user but must include:
   - Your evolving hypotheses
   - Verification techniques you’re choosing and why
   - Points of doubt or alternate interpretations

Only after the scratchpad is complete, write your formal findings in <Response></Response> tags.

I get it’s lifestyle content and it’s supposed to be “mundane” but how many times do we need to see her make the same recipes, go to the same restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee shops, take the same Pilates classes… she doesn’t try anything new!! Try a new recipe or a new type of workout class… do yoga on the beach for a video… try making mexican cuisine or go to a new popup restaurant or something… It’s seriously suffocating to watch as a viewer around Remi’s age.

At this point her videos are just brain rot/something to have on in the background because she puts zero effort in to make creative or interesting content. I’ve been thinking recently about the value the content I consume brings to my life and I couldn’t think of anything to support watching her anymore. It’s not entertaining because I’ve seen it all before, it’s not educational because she constantly misuses words and doesn’t fact check most things she says (and even does/promotes harmful/triggering things like wearing wrist weights while cooking), it’s not calming or comforting because she always puts on a shrill voice and the “HELLO GUYS” sends me into fight or flight… 

I used to find her videos comforting because they were familiar, but with how many ads her videos have and the sponsorships she’s constantly doing, nothing feels genuine and it’s more tiring than rewarding to watch her. 

There hasn’t been much interesting or new commentary on this sub in a while and I know it’s because remi’s content is severely lacking and it’s finally starting to show. I’m just curious why you guys still watch her. I get that a lot of people have been watching her since she started her channel so it must be hard to stop, but do y’all still enjoy her content?

1knbr4b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knbr4b,Nikon P1100,"Backstory: I'm an owner of a dinosaur Nikon D50 w/ 40mm 2.8 (I love this camera and refuse to upgrade, but that's a different post) that I use for macro photography. I wanted to expand my reach (literally) so I was looking at telescopic lenses, new camera setups, researching, researching. 

I kept coming back to the P1000 because of its telescopic reach, convenience, compact (in reference to other options) nature, and I've always been fascinated with it's moon shots. I kept getting convinced out of it because of it's tiny sensor and overall unimpressive specs other than it's zoom.

Anyway, I have my dslr needs covered with my D50 and I wanted something unique to shoot on that could capture things that were always so out of reach. Come to find out, the P1100 was just released this year and added USB-C which I feel like is such an underrated upgrade in terms of charging, transfer, etc. Even though the camera is basically the same as the P1000 the USB-C is actually huge to me along with the Bluetooth upgrade (SnapBridge is great). My whole ecosystem of technology is USBC and I felt this was just the refresh the P1000 needed despite a lot of people being disappointed with it.

I've had the camera for 24hrs so I'm still in the honeymoon phase but just stepping outside for my morning coffee has been a whole different event now that I can literally snipe shots of birds from trees so far away and not even leave my porch. I wanted to post this because after lurking on this sub and seeing so much hate for this camera I wanted to emphasize that it IS useful and a great option if you're in my shoes and want to just casually take some stills of birds on your porch. Attached are some unedited stills and of course the beast itself; maybe a few months down the line I'll make a full review on the camera. As of now, I love it and will be investing in some gear to enhance it's capabilities. Only con of course so far is it's size and heft but I think for what it offers it's as compact as it can be.

After lunch I experienced bloating. About 14 days back I developed severe unbearable pain on the left and right side of my abdomen. And couldn’t sleep properly all night.

Went to a Doctor who advised me the following medicines-

1. Clidinium + Chlordiazepoxide + Dicyclomine before meals for 15 days
2. Rifaximin 550 mg Post meals for 15 days 
3. Ursodeoxycholic Acid 450 mg post meals for 30 days
4. Vitamin E 400mg for 30 days
5. Vitamin D3 one pill per week
6. Methylcobalamin + Alpha Lipoic Acid + Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) + Folic Acid post meals for 30 days
7. Saccharomyces boulardii 250 mg post meals for 10 days

Been on these medications since the past 17 days. I also started exercising for 30 minutes every alternate day. 

Today during the morning I had dark / coffee burnt colour kind of stool. Also had mild abdominal pain during the day. And during the evening I had a strange coloured stool. (Photograph enclosed) https://ibb.co/Mx0GDVRL

No pretty journaling with zero movement. This is the **raw truth** on how your frequency either births your dream life — or blocks it like a damn bouncer.

# WHAT IS “FREQUENCY” — REALLY?

Frequency = the energetic signal you’re sending to life through your feelings, beliefs, and actions — all in sync.”

t’s not about being “happy” 24/7.  
It’s about being **internally aligned** with what you want, emotionally and physically.

If you desire abundance but move like someone stuck in fear — you’re on the WRONG radio station

# WHAT IS ""THE RIGHT FREQUENCY""?

Let’s keep it 100: your “frequency” ain’t just about being *positive* or *visualizing* all day. That’s cute, but *incomplete*. The right frequency is a **state of inner congruence**. Your thoughts, emotions, body, and actions are all speaking the same language — and that language is: “I'm already her. I already got it.”

✅ You feel calm but ready.  
✅ You're not chasing, but you're moving.  
✅ Your body literally *feels pulled* to do things.  
✅ You don't *force* the next step — you *sense* it.  
✅ There's no ""trying"" — there's just *doing*, with quiet certainty.

# ⚠️ THE FAKE FREQUENCY TRAP

Let’s talk about this common LIE we tell ourselves:

“I have the right mindset, I just don’t feel like doing anything.”

BOOM. **Red flag.** 🚩 That’s not alignment. That’s *mental cosplay*. If your mindset isn’t resulting in even a micro-movement, a nudge, an urge, an impulse — then you’re not in alignment. You’re in **fantasy frequency** — sounds good, feels safe, gets you nowhere.

Truth is: **when you're TRULY in the right frequency, taking action doesn’t feel hard — it feels like oxygen.** You feel *compelled* to do something. Something clicks. It flows.

# 📡 EXAMPLE 1: MONEY MINDSET — BROKE FREQUENCY VS ABUNDANCE FREQUENCY

* Broke frequency: “I need money... but I can’t spend anything. I’m scared. I need to manifest but I don’t feel safe even buying myself a coffee.”You’re sending: ✨ “I don’t trust life. I don’t believe money flows back. I’m afraid.” So life responds: Okay, let’s keep you in lack.



* Abundance frequency: “I have enough for now, and more is coming. Let me circulate this energy — even in small ways.” You treat your ₹100 like royalty. You act like money is your bestie — not your captor.You’re sending: 🌀 “I trust. I believe in overflow.” So life responds: Bet. Here's more.

# 💘 EXAMPLE 2: LOVE — WRONG FREQUENCY VS RIGHT FREQUENCY

* Wrong frequency:---> “I want real love... but I keep chasing people who don’t even respect me. ”You’re moving from LACK, insecurity, craving, proving. Even if you say “I’m manifesting love,” your body’s like: “I’m desperate. I’ll accept crumbs.”So  life’s like: Cool. Here’s another emotionally unavailable idiot.



* Right frequency: --->“I am love. I choose only what reflects that. I’d rather be alone than misaligned.” You don’t chase. You don’t settle. You embody the energy of already BEING loved. That’s when real connections magically show up.

# 💼 EXAMPLE 3: GOALS — RIGHT MINDSET BUT NO ACTION? RED FLAG.

You say:

“I want to be successful. I want to be rich. I believe in my dreams.”

But:

* You’re not even googling what steps to take.
* You procrastinate every day.
* You feel zero motivation.
*  “If your mindset isn’t moving your ass, it’s not your real mindset — it’s your fantasy.”

Real alignment pulls you.  
It whispers “go do that thing right now.”  
It’s subtle but urgent.

#  HOW TO KNOW YOU’RE OUT OF FREQUENCY

Here’s the checklist. Be brutally honest:

*  Constant overthinking? → You don’t trust.
*  No energy to move? → You’re disconnected.
*  Saying affirmations but doing NOTHING? → You’re cosplaying alignment.
*  You’re chasing things that don’t even feel right? → You’re in fear.
*  Feeling like life is heavy and unfair? → You’re stuck in victim loop.

If you checked any of these: YOU ARE NOT IN THE RIGHT FREQUENCY.  
And that’s okay. You don’t fix it by grinding. You fix it by **recalibrating**.

# IF YOU’RE STUCK? SURRENDER ≠ GIVE UP.

Don’t get it twisted: *surrender* isn’t sitting around hoping something will happen.

Surrender is:

“I know I don’t see the whole map right now.  
But I trust the next step I’m about to take *is the one.* Even if it’s small, even if I don’t get instant results. It’s *correct.* Because my soul said so.”

It’s **radical faith**. It’s **letting go of control** but *not* of direction. It’s that badass, feminine power of **releasing grip but still moving** like the main character.

  


# HOW TO RE-ENTER THE RIGHT FREQUENCY (Even If You’re In a Rut)

1. **PAUSE. Surrender.**“Trying harder from the wrong frequency only creates more chaos.”
2. **Ask your soul:**“What’s the next natural step I’m being guided toward?” (Not the most *impressive* step — the most *true* one.)
3. **When the ping hits — OBEY.**The moment you feel that inner nudge, *act on it*. Don’t wait. Don’t rationalize. That’s your soul giving you a breadcrumb toward your dream life.
4. **Anchor in trust:**“Even if I don’t understand how… this step is the EXACT move I need to take to align with the life I desire.”

If your mindset isn’t *making you move*, it’s not the right mindset.  
If your body feels *dead*, your frequency is off.  
If your “plan” needs 500 validations, it’s not soul-aligned.  
If you’re overthinking, you don’t trust yourself yet.  
And if you don’t trust yourself — start there. Because self-trust *is* the frequency.

Your dream life isn’t something you achieve by planning it like a spreadsheet.  
It’s something you **co-create** moment by moment — by aligning, feeling, trusting, moving, surrendering, again and again.

You’re not lost.  
You’re just remembering.  
Let it click.  
And when it does — MOVE.

1knbi55,https://i.redd.it/ryedyo7sny0f1.png,Native Combination Tree Planting for (Appealing) Sight Blocker,"Hi all, 

TLDR: I'm looking for a nice combination of trees to provide a visual screen in the area pictured above, but face difficult growing conditions.  Seeking advice for an attractive/varied combination of native trees and shrubs that would coexist nicely together and provide privacy and visual interest (plus wildlife benefit). 

S, M, L = Small/Medium/Large trees and EVENTUAL canopy sizes (not immediate).  Forgive my MS Paint skills, I did my best!

Long version: 

I own approx. 4 acres of former farm field (no trees beyond what I and developers have planted).  I'm considering planting several trees down my property line and would like to start, for many reasons, with a visual/privacy screen between me and the neighbors, at least while we're sitting on the (2nd story) deck. I don't need IMMEDIATE effect but I'd like to have a decent (but attractive) visual wall in the next few years that isn't the typical Arborvitae wall.   I expect they'll do the trick once they're 10-15ft high. 

I'm extremely conflicted as to WHAT to plant, given the circumstances, particularly when it comes to large trees (75-100ft+, eventually).

I'm combating a number of difficult conditions for planting: 

1. **High winds** \- 20-40mph winds are not uncommon here, and there are no wind-breaks.  
2. The side-yard is on a gentle slope running to the back yard, and drains quickly, **conditions are fairly dry**  
3. The soil is about 6-8"" of topsoil, followed by 8"" of heavy (red) clay, then hardpan clay.  It **drains poorly** and is full of smooth, baseball sized rocks.   
4. **Proximity to Garage, Septic Drain field** \- need to be careful about root intrusion or large trees potentially falling.  Luckily, they'd have to fall uphill to hit the garage. 

I'm struggling to find some large, ""anchor"" tree species that would tolerate these conditions.   
\- We have Extensive EAB damage, so Ash trees are out (Along with Elm, Chestnut)  
\- Red Oaks are diseased and dying in droves around me  
\- Red Maples are the opposite problem - they sprout everywhere... so I'd like to avoid adding more  
\- We have a TON of Eastern Red Cedar (with rust), and I may want to plant some fruit trees eventually...so Red Cedar and other Junipers are out...   
\- Beech Leaf Disease is present just north of here, and will arrive here soon enough  
\- Pines, Sycamores, and Tulip Poplars likely couldn't withstand the wind  
\- Trying to avoid things like Sweet Gum/ ""messy"" trees toward the house, but would consider them, or hackberry trees, further down the hill. 

I'm not sure how they would fare in my soil conditions, but I think I'm down to:  
\- White Oak - but not sure which variety is best for the soil conditions  
\- Black Gum   
\- Hickory (would love species advice)  
\- Black Cherry (abundant around me, but perhaps too prone to wind damage)  
\- Maybe Coffee Tree?  
\- Maybe Honey Locust?  Though I understand they're aggressive spreaders... and not sure if they're really native to HERE (we have black locust, which I won't plant for the same reason). 

Would love to know if I'm missing any obvious winners for large/medium trees that tolerate pretty bad soil conditions.  Would also LOVE some advice/guidance as to nice combinations to plant for seasonal interest! ",1,1747323936.0,NativePlantGardening,0,1.0,False

1knbfzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1knbfzp/so_my_dad_is_cheating_on_my_mother_with_my/,"So My Dad is cheating on my mother with my ex-girlfriend's mom. I'm so lost and confused, it's been dragging on for like 6 months now and I'm worried this will hurt my future. I'm still in highschool.","So some background My ex (lets call her Izzy ) and I started dating in 8th grade we were 14 M and 14 F. We dated until January of my 10th year of high school (sophomore year) which at the time i'm writing this It's the end of sophomore year. This is my first time ever writing about my feelings and I have a tough time opening up to this but since complete strangers might read this who cares. I'm not the best writer but I just want to know peoples thoughts and what maybe they would do. My mother has had a stable job for many years and makes all the money in my house. My father hasn't had a job since last year. When he does have a job it's for about 4-8 months and its never anything stable. When he did have a job he didn't do any work. He was kinda a stay at home dad that was into my business all the time. A helicopter parent that had too much time on his hands, and claimed he hated drama but was always involved. 

So about her family. Her mother and her were close but fought a lot. Her mother (Call her Julie)  had her when she was 19 with this man but they are not together and split when Izzy was little. She got pregnant with this man and got married so she has 2 kids total with 2 dads. So Izzy had a step dad and sister but this man wasn't a dad. He was more like a quirky theater kid than a man child. But the parents were never in love, just friends that got pregnant. Anyways my Family, My parents have been married for about 18 years and were happy for the most part. They loved each other and supported my brothers and I. 

So from the beginning where It all started. The first time I ever noticed something was up was around the end of my freshman year and we were out doing something as 2 families. We were in the downtown of my small town and hanging out at this farmers market and I noticed some things off between them. Like it was they were giving too much attention, you know when you can sense something was up but you can't jump right to it. Well I remember looking at Izzy and my brothers and asking if they thought it was strange too, and they did. So it wasn't just me. I later talked with my dad telling him I thought how he acted to Julie and how she acted towards him was offly strange. They both are flirty people but this was different. Something was off and I knew it from the beginning. After the school year ended it was summer and I saw Izzy a lot more which caused our families to see each other more and they planned many hangouts at our house. Well I always thought these were good ideas because I mean I get to see my Girlfriend and if Julie was over that means they can stay later and yeah. Her step dad never came to these things and usually stayed at home filming himself for whatever he was doing, Again he was a strange man and wasn’t around. Anyways I remember one time Julie came over while my mother was out of town and I was in my room with Izzy, we were hanging out and watching movies, I remember it clear as the day I came out of my room to find my dad laying on our coffee table with his shirt off and Julie behind him with these weird cupping things. The cups that are used for sucking on your back like medical cupping or something strange, anyways it was a fucking weird sight. They both looked at me and said uhhh hi. I asked them what they were doing and they were just giggling and doing this weird thing. I was so weirded out but didn't think it was too weird to call my mother at the moment. But later that night she called and asked what was up and didn't know Julie came over to hangout with my dad. She found out and was mad because he didn't tell her and they were doing that weird cupping shit. My father explained to her that everyone was there and watching and that it wasn't a strange thing but that was not the case. I was in my room with Izzy and my brothers were not home. I never spoke up and told her that no one was home and how it was just the 2 of them, but it was so fucked up. Well in that summer my mom, my brothers and I grew more and more suspicious of my fathers actions and at this time Julie and he called a lot and texted each other everyday. So my mother ended up wanting him to stop texting her. He assured my mother, my brothers and I that nothing was weird and that he's usually like this with all his friends. But this wasn't like him. He's not the one to have a girl that was a “friend” that was like fake married! At this time my parents were fighting a lot because my mom was suspicious of what was going on and he wouldn't give her his phone and show them their messages. He kept deleting messages and it was really strange and messed up. Towards the end of summer and going into the current school year (sophomore year) Julie and Her husband got a divorce and were told everyone they weren't in love and were more like friends. But this grew my family's suspicions on my father. At this time he was constantly leaving to go see friends and spending time away from my family. We were all paranoid, Like anyone else would be.

So the time was thanksgiving. I wanted to break up with Izzy. We had been dating for about a year and a half and it was a solid relationship for the most part. But we had problems just like anyone else in high school. Lots of problems that grew over time but not so important. So I wanted to break up with Izzy and I told my father about this. I can't remember the full conversation but he convinced me to hold off till we got through the holiday and I understood and stuck it out. Then Christmas came around and I couldn't tell if I was just in a funk or I really did want to break up with her. Because well I'm a teenager and I still struggle with emotions. Anyways It was around christmas time and I realised I wanted to end things and I wasn't happy, but I held out because it was winter break and Christmas and new years were right around the corner and I wouldn't do that to her. All while this is happening from the summer to now my family and house felt off. We all knew something was up but just needed to find some type of proof. I wanted to believe my dad so badly and I did for a while but then he kept acting stranger and stranger. Its like one day he woke up and changed. I could tell something was up with him. We all could. He was gone a lot, Turned off his life 360, got mad when we were asked where he was and yeah. All signs were leading to maybe he was seeing her or still talking to her. So leading up to Christmas everything was strange and we all felt weird about my dad. 

Christmas day. It was christmas day, we all woke up not as a family but very scattered. It wasn't a very connected Christmas, it was just like something was up and something was. I had weird feelings like it wasnt a special day or anything, it was just a day nothing special. Anyways It was the next day that everything changed. My father left for the store and I got up when he was gone because he goes at like 8 or 9, but very early for the day after christmas. I remember I was grabbing something to eat and my mom walked into the kitchen and greeted me. She didn't know he had left and he didn't even say goodbye to anyone. I was standing there chatting with my mother about my sleep when she got a call… It was Julie. Puzzled, my mom looked at me and picked up. “Hello?” my mother said strangely because she doesn't talk to Julie. Distant chatting we heard and a deep man's voice then silence. Then suddenly we heard a softer woman's voice “So if you're not in love with her, get a divorce.” In the moment my life paused. I stood there in shock staring at my mother. My mother quickly put herself on mute, She told me she thought it was possibly a butt dial? I just couldn't, she just looked at me with these eyes. They were, They were just these broken eyes and a face that was starting to cry but she didn't cry, She held it in. I can't explain exactly how it looked in the right words but I have the picture in my mind. All this happened in like 10 seconds. We were in such shock. We heard more chattering and Julie said his name. The name of my father. I couldn't believe it, maybe it was someone else. This couldn't possibly be happening to me. But no. It was him. I think they realized they had called my mother by accident and they quickly hung up. Like it was a message from god, Almost like it was out of a movie. Unreal what are the chances she butt-dials my mother the single moment they spoke of getting him to leave my family for her. Again this wasn't a random lady. This woman's daughter I had been dating for a year and a half and at the time this happened I was still dating her. Before I felt all the feelings come rushing my mother dropped. She was crying, swearing, and crumbling. She was falling apart and rushed to my arms. I just held her and cried. I couldn't believe it was true, but it was. I could go more into detail but she ended up getting my brothers awake and we explained what just happened while she was breaking down. I just remember the hatred I had towards my father at that moment. Words can't explain but I would have done anything in that moment to make my mom not feel what she was feeling. It was one of the most difficult things I've done just trying my best to hold it all in while my mom curled up in my arms. My dad came in the house about 20 minutes later and I don't think it could've gone worse. He came to my brother and I. He told us he was in love with Julie and does not want to be married to my mother anymore. I couldn't even look at him. I wanted to hurt him. So much hatred built up inside of me. Everything we had even suspected was true. Everything he told us was a lie, He was leaving us for my girlfriend's mother. I couldn't even process the things he was telling me. I felt so disgusted and gross. How could he do this to us? Me. My mother. My brothers. We didn't deserve this. No one did. My memory is kinda scattered during this time but I remember that night I explained everything that happened that night to Izzy with her mother and my father. I also remember the feelings I had that day. I don't remember much of what happened later that day but a 2 weeks later I broke up with Izzy, After that day I haven't seen my father the same. Like he's a different man, maybe not even a man. Because what man does that to his “Family” That he loves so much.

Back to square 1. About a month passed. They were in couples therapy and he claimed he hasn't talked to her or had seen her since that day. We all agreed but deep down we all had our skepticism. My mom, oh man My mom tried. She reached her very farthest to take him back. She believed that she could save this man. She put everything into it and I'm happy she did, Months of couples therapy and nothing changed. Nothing changed and they were still distant and they tried like 3 different therapists and each for a different reason. But this carried on for about 5 months. What sucks to write this is most of this time was a blur and I was still angry and disgusted at my father for his actions. It's not like I can stay extremely mad for 5 months but I definitely wasn't going out of my way for him. Like I wouldnt answer text messages, stop saying I love him back, he hugged me I never hugged him. He told us he was sorry but I couldn't look him in his eyes. He started to pick up on this and yelled at me for it. He told me it was disrespectful. Also at this time he claimed he and Julie never meant to fall in love and they just grew into love. Which when I think about it is more disgusting. He said that he's never touched her and they have only talked. Which is weird I thought. We all knew he was in love with her including my mother but she kept trying. She was willing to take him back and fix things and for a while it looked like it was going to work but then one day it just didn’t. Eventually after 5 months of my mother trying to take him back and forget the flaws he had, she got tired. I believe my father had this planned out. Because for those 5 months they were like good 1 day a week then for the other 6 they just didn't work. They ended up coming to an agreement that after they pay off all their debt they would be getting a divorce. At this time I was saddened but also releaved. Finally my house could stop feeling like a purgatory. So I thought. Nope they still are currently living together just separate lives. Its so fucking weird, My mother even one time looked at the phone record out of curiosity. What we found was just disgusting. They called like 5 times a day for hours. Whenever he left he called her. He had been leaving constantly Since christmas this has been going on. And now after all this time my father admits to me he has been seeing Julie since christmas. I was absolutely pissed off and had so much more hatred in my heart for him. After all this time I thought things were getting better but it was all part of his fucking plan. Just slowly slip out of my family, and into a new one like nothing ever happened. Also this is my Ex Girlfriends family.

He also admitted to me this month that he has been seeing Julie when he goes to do groceries, and when he goes to see friends he sees her before them. I wanted him to be completely honest with me because I deserve to know what is going on. He told me that they have kissed and strongly claims that they haven't done anything besides kiss. I don't believe him. He also told me he has gone over there for dinner and to hangout with her family. This hurt so much to hear. It crushed me but when he told me I wasn't surprised just disappointed it was true. I asked him if Izzy knew that they were doing this and he said she did. He told me both Izzy and her step sister see him when he goes over there. Im so disgusted and I just cant fucking believe this man. 

All while this is going on Izzy is going crazy. Ever since I broke up with her she has gone down a spiraling path. She dated a dude and from what I saw she treated him like shit and basically cheated on him. They later broke up. 

This was going on and my lacrosse season was going on. I had talked to a couple of girls but with my current situation I just felt so weird. I couldn't focus on someone because I couldn't even focus on myself. I felt gross talking to anyone because I didn't want them knowing my father might soon be dating Izzy’s mother Julie. Izzy and I dated for a while and most of the school knows. So I always felt weird and just insecure about it, and still do. This caused me to have more hatred towards my father. Out of anyone you wanted to be with Julie. 

Right now I'm talking to someone and for the first time she is someone I wanted to focus on besides lacrosse and school. She's at a different school and doesn't know much about what's going on with my family and little about my ex’s. 

Also I tried my best to keep Izzy out of my life because she did many things that caused me to break up with her and I just don't want anything to do with her. When I look at her I just feel grossed out. This isn't even the worst part. Izzy, the girl I dated a while ago, is going around telling her team full of girls that gossip that we will be siblings, and how she will be able to see me every day again. When I heard that news I literally broke down. Why is she thinking this? What the fuck is wrong with her. She wants our parents to date so then she can try to live with me. And now she's telling her friends I'm her husband. I was on the bus with my team when I read that. I literally felt like throwing up. I'm seeing this new girl and I fear she will find out and not want to date me. My dad assured me that if he dated Julie I would not have to see them and not have anything to do with them. So what do I do because Izzy is posting all these things on her story about how she changed me and telling people my business and AHHHH i just fucking hate her. She's causing so much shit I wish never happened. I hate my father. I hate Izzy. I hate Julie. Why does this have to happen to me? I just want to be fine and keep going out with this girl and possibly date her. I fear when she finds out she wont want to date me. I haven't told her anything because it's fairly new and It's not important yet. WHAT DO I DO? My mother is now wanting him out of the house and to divorce quickly because she's now tired of putting up with his shit. He lives in our house and doesn't work. He is cheating on my mother and coming home to sleep. They sleep in different beds but my mom is still paying for everything. My mom doesn't know they've kissed but she basically knows just hasn't been told. She knows basically everything going on but I just want Izzy’s family out of my life. I broke up with her because I want her gone and my father is now in love with her mom. I've literally thought at suidcide but know its not the right path. I feel so helpless and don’t know how to act towards my father because he acts like everything is okay and that my parents are just going to go different ways and we all have to accept Julie because it wasn't her fault they fell in love. Well it is. She cheated on her husband before they got a divorce and my father cheats on my mom. I don't want her in my life and I definitely don't want Izzy in my life. WHAT DO I DO? This has been hard to write because some parts are just all blurred together but those are the big parts. I'll keep it updated if something new happens but this is where i'm at right now. I want out of my life and family. I want to run away to a new state. Where no one knows me. I'm only a sophomore in highschool and I fear this situation will affect me a lot. Sorry this is so long, again I’m a sophomore so I just have a ton of feelings I can’t explain but here’s where i am. ",0,1747323792.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

1knbepy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Incense/comments/1knbepy/whats_your_ideal_incense_burn_time_i_swear_by_30/,What’s your ideal incense burn time? I swear by 30 minutes—it’s my moving meditation.,"Just wondering—do you have a preferred incense burn time?

I’ve been lighting a 30-minute stick every day, and it’s weirdly become the most *stable* part of my routine. I work on the go—coffee shops, co-working spaces, Airbnbs—and that short burn gives me just enough time to reset, meditate, or even journal.

No timers, no to-do lists. Just scent, breath, and a little pocket of stillness.  
It’s like a **ritualized pause** that tells my brain, *“You’re safe. You’re here. Exhale.”*

Longer sticks sometimes feel too drawn out for me, but I’m super curious:

* What’s your sweet spot for incense burn time?
* Do you switch it up for different moods or spaces?

Like others, once I discovered I couldn’t have multiple businesses running I was a bit disappointed, but determined to figure out a way to make a workable mall. 

Late yesterday I decided to try again inspired by my local mall turned weird multipurpose building in an attempt to stay afloat. After some creative Frankensteining of rooms together I got it to work!

So, I have a 5 story mall that goes partly underground. The first two stories have the anchor businesses…and a couple apartments. By creating the mall as a residential rental I designated the shops as shared spaces and sectioned off each apartment. The basement floors have a bowling alley, an ice rink, a classroom, a bar, and a cafe and the lowest level is the rest of the apartments. Each resident of the apartments has a business in each of the other places, but when the other businesses aren’t active the rest of the residents of the building use the ‘shared spaces’ and become NPCs for the mall in a way. I have a bar so I can hire a mixologist and make it look like someone is running it, and a kiosk for a massage chair for the same effect, and honestly it’s the closest I’ve come to feeling like I’m in a real mall without having to hire individuals and have them each try to run a part of the mall themselves. 

It’s not without its own flaws of course, as with other things it has a couple kinks and glitches, but for the most part it’s fun to see each of the apartment residents go to the bowling alley while I run the cafe, and the customers occasionally will go next door as well after they’re done with their coffee and it adds to the atmosphere of the mall, and kind of funny that it actually has more customers than its namesake currently does and may close soon for good for that reason.

I \[29F\] have recently split up from my ex \[29M\], we were together for 5 years and lived together. I am trying to be friends with him and really want to talk though what we went through, and I am also waiting to receive deposit money from him which I direly need. We are in a fight I do not know how to solve because of how things have gone in the past and I need help.

**Background and what I’m processing: pls skip if you want**

The relationship was very turbulent for a lot of that due to lots of circumstances, but which I blamed myself for and tried to change. My mental health suffered greatly, but again I just thought from what he said that it was because I wasn’t trying hard enough, and he kept telling me how awful and traumatic it was for him and how I was a bad partner. Granted I was snappy, he would use himself as an example of being regulated whilst I was crying and upset and I’d say mean things like ‘do you want a gold star!’. I was not easy to live with during that time.

The other half of the mental health stuff though (alongside the fact I have severe C/PTSD and lifelong severe anxiety/agoraphobia from child abuse which has involved periods of suicidality and psychosis, but I TRY and have spent my entire adult life working to get better!), is that I was being loaded with medications that year to try and help, for the first time in my life. Some of them did not agree with me, dangerously, and after a few years I finally came off of one med, stopped doing EMDR, and stopped actually sharing my hurt feelings with him and trusting him to be kind to me and the suicide stuff pretty much completely stopped (albeit was replaced with huge panic attacks).

I would have wanted my partner to maybe care about that and notice that about me, but instead I would be criticised for my suicide attempts and lack of ability to ‘regulate my emotions’, told I was asking too much from him to want to be treated with kindness, told I was making excuses every time I tried to talk about my mental health or that I was making it all about me and not treating him like a person if I tried to talk about how scared I was, that if I ever said his behaviour was hurting me or I felt angry or argumentative, I was told it was from a victim complex and I ‘saw him as an enemy’. 

When I would bring up things that I felt hurt by, I would often be met with ‘the problem with you is you analyse everything’ or he would say that I use over the top language, that we must have different definitions etc. he would say it was unfair of me to say that he DID do xyz, and instead I should have curiosity in understanding where he was coming from, because everything is always subjective so my idea that he had hurt me was subjective, and came from me thinking badly of him. He only apologised if he felt he had done something which warranted an apology by his own standards. It has left me not knowing how a conversation should even go, so confused constantly. 

He would always tell me I was lording the idea of ‘care’ over him, that I never defined it and never knew how to ask for what I needed, that I was always so vague and expected him to be a mind reader and it was extremely unfair, setting him up to fail, so I tried so hard to be specific, but then when I was it was that I was being patronising or asking too much. I tried so hard to define care, and when I would give examples of what I do to care like ‘make you coffee in bed, make you meals, care for you when you’re not feeling great, listen to your troubles and make time to cuddle up together and put on music and have fun, work on my flaws’ etc, I was told over and over again a few versions of ‘that means nothing to me, all of that is for you’.

the turning point was I got very sick and was desperate for care, like meals cooked for me, or cups or tea, or to tidy the house, ANYTHING (I made him coffee in bed for years and also kept the house stocked with herbs/made us daily pots of tea as I am also quite badly chronically ill and tea blends really help my pain). I asked for some roasted beetroots one day, and he asked me for instructions. I couldn’t think or use my phone from pain so I said ‘I don’t know how to roast beetroots good, I would have had to just look up a recipe’. That quickly became me being unfair and having ‘unspoken expectations’, because he doesn’t know how to roast beetroot and I was being dismissive and rude, essentially telling him to just ‘google it’. I don’t remember but I don’t think I ever got my beetroots, though I have a memory of chopping them myself crying in pain. I truly don’t even know anymore if I was being unfair or not I don’t have a stance and I don’t have anyone to bounce off of, I felt so guilty at the time but also confused and my gut was churning.

Anyway, I feel like I’ve just painted a terrible picture of the exact victim complex. But alas! Perhaps that’s all it is.

**The issue:**

Fast forward to today, I have moved away, and we are still talking, he still has some of my furniture, and the shared deposit hasn’t been released yet/is going to him. He says I am like family, and we still have things to sort out from our time living together. I don’t have any other support at all.

After packing up our old home last night he texted something about the house and said ‘I know a lot of it was maybe horrible/rubbish for you’. I asked more about what he meant, and said I never felt like he really believed or understood that it was hard for me, that he only thought that I was the one that needed to change. I was tentative but wondered if this was him reflecting a little bit, because I did tell him that I ended the relationship because I didn’t like how he treated me and how I didn’t feel cared for. His response was that ‘it would be insane for him to have not believed me, that he could say he believed me every time and it would almost be correct’. He said ‘my understanding of you having a bad time comes from the things you have said to me so if you’re wondering what I think of when I think of you having a bad time \[in the house we lived in together\] it would be majoritively stuff you have said’.

I was confused and upset and my upset and told him. His response was ‘like 1) sure I get you disliking me being detached and talking about it in that way - fair enough! Completely reasonable, me a massive twat…’ and then 9 whole massive paragraphs about how unfair I am being, that I am expecting him to ‘jus come back one day and understand everything you think and feel and did think and feel and totally nail it all completely by myself unprovoked and I don’t think YOU have shared it with me’. He says that I am putting a huge unfair weight on him and that my desperation for retrospection and understanding will only come from me ‘communicating’.

The thing is, I feel like I have already told him everything he wants to know multiple times and he has never listened, and I don’t know if my spirit can handle another conversation where he lists my character flaws and sort of ‘kindly’ berates me. He has done it until I passed out before and then when I came round he would be angry at me for passing out and making a big deal and ‘not being able to take criticism’.

I feel like I really just need to smooth this over, I really don’t want to fight when he might owe me hundreds very soon, but I have no idea how to piece it together. I feel like I am a terrible person who is missing some grave understanding and that I just hurt everyone. I have told him over and over that I need time and space to process the relationship because I am hurting and I don’t know I am just so confused. I’m sorry this was so long and I’m sorry you had to read this mess.

A few days ago I made a post about my upcoming date with this Deaf guy I met on a dating app and asked for advice on how I could learn ASL as fast as possible. I knew I couldn’t possibly become fluent in such a short amount of time but I tried to learn as many signs as I could. 

So yesterday, we had our date, and I couldn’t even remember half of the signs I’d looked up. 😩 I was so excited and quite nervous. But the date was successful! 

He was so happy to see I put in effort and picked up some signs. We texted back and forth a lot, but we also used oral communication! He didn’t speak but I did and he lipread me. 

He told me he sucks at lipreading before but I think he was just being humble, because I was amazed by how well he could lipread me! 

And since he could lipread so well, I wanted to ask him if he can speak too, but I thought it would be rude to ask so I didn’t. Later I found out he doesn’t — he had some awful memories with being forced into speech therapy and being mainstreamed and because of it, he doesn’t comfortable using his voice especially around hearing people. (Please don’t shame him for trauma-dumping on the first date, I wasn’t bothered by it and he apologized for) 

He took me out this time, so to hint I wanted a second date, I signed that next time I want to take him out for coffee. I’m not sure how clear my signing was but he could understand me and agreed to it! So we will keep seeing each other. 💗 He said he would more than happy to help me learn ASL. 

But I don’t want to put all the work on him so I will look into ASL classes on my own, but I’m not sure when I should actually sign up for a class. I kinda want to now, but my friends are acting like I am crazy for considering starting classes for a guy I just met. They are telling me at least not to tell him if I end up taking classes because it will make me look desperate. But I think he would rather appreciate and feel flattered, because he was so happy to see I picked up some signs for our first date.

Whether you're a crypto veteran or a curious newbie testing the waters, our app takes the guesswork out of receiving BTC. And it’s not just for ATMs—you can use the QR code on websites, business cards, storefronts, or taped to your cat if they’re cool with it. (Disclaimer: your cat will not become a millionaire.)

The Colonel's head hung limply. It was bent at an odd angle, like someone had tried to unplug him and realized—too late—that the cable was spinal. A single strand of spit dangled from his lower lip, reaching toward the floor like it was seeking a better life. It finally let go with a *plop*, echoing through the cavernous war room.

Around him, his elite team lay scattered, slumped in positions that were both battle-hardened and comfort-seeking. Some were curled like shrimp. Others looked like they'd simply tipped over while standing and decided, ""Eh, this is good.""

The room smelled faintly of chicken grease, sadness, and eucalyptus (someone had brought nap-scented candles from home).

And then...

The Colonel stirred.

A single eyelid twitched.

His face, scarred by battles both digital and delicious, contorted with effort. The pained look on his face told a story—a terrible story involving betrayal, bad cafeteria coffee, and the trauma of low-sodium gravy.

He finally lifted his head, snapped his neck back into place with a noise that sounded like a thousand packets of ketchup being stepped on, and whispered:

**“Okay. Nap time is over.”**

The words rippled through the chamber like a shockwave of lukewarm mashed potatoes.

All around him, the operatives began to stir.

Agent Biscuit kicked over his emergency scone stash. Lieutenant Wing tried to stand but found his legs entangled in an experimental biscuit armor prototype. Sergeant Extra-Crispy rubbed his eyes and wept softly—not from pain, but from forgetting his nap pillow.

“Oh sweet extra thighs,” muttered Drumstick, blinking. “I dreamt we lost the Sauce Wars again.”

“You did,” said the Colonel. “We always do. But not this time.”

Suddenly—**BARK!**

Poopsy had awoken.

The half-Chewelah, half-Great Dane stood perched on the edge of the Colonel’s shoulder-mounted sidecar. A single droplet of drool dangled precariously from his snoot. He barked again—once for affirmation, twice for vengeance, three times because he forgot what he was doing.

He had been trained to recognize imminent universal calamity—and his ears twitched in response to a distant, eerie hum.

Everyone in the room froze.

Because they all knew that sound.

**The McTrek Armada had arrived.**

# The Golden Arches of Doom

Out in the vacuum of space, just beyond Earth’s ionosphere, a fleet of saucer-shaped ships glimmered like deep-fried halos. Each bore the glowing twin arches of the McTrek Corporation, shimmering with sinister red neon.

These weren’t your drive-thru Happy Meal haulers. No—these were full military-grade vessels: orbit-capable, gravy-fueled, and piloted by cloned interns named Chad.

The McTrek flagship, *The Grease Falcon*, loomed largest. Its hull was crusted with generations of re-fried re-fried oil. Its weapon systems were simple but devastating: ketchup torpedoes, mustard lasers, and a gravitational beam that pulled entire salads off plates.

Inside, Supreme Commander Mealbot X-57—half AI, half mascot, half something legally redacted—hovered menacingly.

""Target Earth’s menu integrity,"" he ordered, his voice glitching between Ronald McDonald and a microwave error code.  
""We will eliminate all resistance and digitize every lunch.""

A crew member raised a nugget-shaped hand. ""Uh, sir… we’re detecting rogue data streams from... the Chicken Strings.""

Mealbot paused. Somewhere in his internal circuitry, a memory was triggered: a single greasy feather drifting across a steel floor.

""The Kernel..."" he whispered. ""He’s still out there.""

# Back at KFCIS Command

""Poopsy, initiate **Fowl Protocol**,"" the Colonel ordered.

Poopsy barked twice and headbutted a glowing red button marked:  
**ONLY USE IF APOCALYPTIC CHICKEN STORM**.

The floor shifted.

The entire war room began to descend—spiraling downward on a grease-powered elevator until it reached the secret core of KFCIS operations: **The Deep Fry Nexus**.

There, floating in a vat of superheated chicken oil, was the last functioning Kernel Mainframe—affectionately nicknamed “Kevin.”

Kevin had been built during the Great Fried Singularity and was powered by an old Commodore 64. No one knew exactly how it still worked, but it *did*. Occasionally. On Tuesdays.

The Colonel approached solemnly, his wheelchair creaking. “Kevin, old friend. We need the Chicken Strings.”

The screen flickered and displayed the following:

**PLEASE ENTER PASSWORD.**

Agent Biscuit stepped forward. “Umm... Poopsy123?”

**INCORRECT.**

Lieutenant Wing: “Try... `butterbattles`?”

**INCORRECT.**

Suddenly Poopsy leapt up and mashed his paws into the keyboard.

**PASSWORD ACCEPTED. WELCOME, MASTER P.**

The machine roared to life. A glowing stream of golden binary feathers filled the chamber. Code danced across the walls like sentient waffle fries.

Kevin spoke, his voice now a chorus of clucks and modem screeches:

**CHICKEN STRINGS ACTIVATED.**

A hatch opened beneath them, revealing twelve gleaming cords—woven from the digital DNA of every chicken-themed marketing campaign since 1952. Each string represented a domain of power:

* **The Gravy Core**
* **The Crumb Cradle**
* **The Spork Nexus**
* **The Coupon Void**
* **And the Secret Herb and Algorithm**

# To the Final Frontier

Within hours, the KFCIS team had converted a decommissioned Zinger Bucket into a warp-capable spacecraft. They called it **The Poultrygeist**. Its engines ran on reclaimed gravy and haunted fryer oil from a Waffle House in Louisiana.

The Colonel sat in the captain’s chair, helmet askew, chicken leg in hand.

“We ride at full crisp, for freedom and for flavor!”

“But sir,” Drumstick asked, “Aren’t we already in space?”

The Colonel looked at him solemnly.  
“Spiritually, Drumstick. It’s not about where you are. It’s about how crunchy you go.”

He tapped the console.

**“Poultrygeist—engage maximum crisp.”**

The ship surged forward into the stars, ready to face the McTrek Armada. Ready to reclaim the menu. Ready for the final fight.

As they soared, the stars rearranged themselves into a single message across the void:

During my fast, I drank water, 1 cup of black coffee in the morning, took a men's one a day vitamin and made sure I got my daily recommended doses of Sodium, Potassium and magnesium. I never got any headaches, only felt fatigued or lightheaded when I would do something strenuous, Otherwise I felt great during the fast for the most part. 

  
The hardest days for me doing this fast was days 2 and 3, then days 28 and 29.. Everything in-between i was pretty much okay with either no symptoms or very little. 



For me, beating the hunger feeling was pretty easy, the really really hard part was beating the ""eat because you're bored"" feeling.  That feeling didnt go away until probably around day 20 or so. I had to really distract myself late nights when I had nothing to do but sit and watch tv because the majority of my life when I'm bored I eat - this is also the main reason why I decided to do this fast. I have had so much trouble trying to breakt this habit in the past as I do it without thinking. So I figured if I can go 30 days with no food, I have no more excuses. 

  
Anyway, I still have about 50lbs to lose to be at my goal weight of 220lbs, but I'm feeling really good about it! ",219,1747322821.0,fasting,43,0.98,False

1knay6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1knay6o/they_said_i_was_sick_until_i_unlocked_the_secret/,"""They Said I Was Sick, Until I Unlocked the Secret Novel""- My sister got married at twenty and had my nephew at twenty-one.","Chapter 1  
  
My sister got married at twenty and had my nephew at twenty-one. Me? Twenty-seven, still unmarried.  
  
Over the years, I've brought several boyfriends home. Each time, my dad invites them into his study for a ""chat.""  
  
But every single guy who walks out of that study—guys who were all lovey-dovey with me before—suddenly gives me the cold shoulder afterward. Some even look like they literally want to strangle me.  
  
And the latest guy? He thought my dad was a total jerk and swore he'd stand up for me. But after he stormed out the study, he dumped me on the spot, and even slapped me across the face twice.  
  
I'm completely baffled. What's the real reason they all leave me? What secrets in that study??  
  
\---  
  
""You are such a disgusting slut!""  
  
""Next time I should just let your boyfriends kill you. Maybe then you'd learn your lesson!""  
  
After my boyfriend stormed out, Dad turned on me, face twisted with rage.  
  
Actually, I've dated five guys over the years. Every single relationship ended the same way—badly. And every single guy changed after visiting Dad's study.  
  
I'd like to believe people don't change that quickly, but the evidence is right in front of me.  
  
I frowned at Dad, waiting for an apology that would never come.  
  
The look in his eyes said he'd rather tear me apart.  
  
He seemed genuinely disappointed my boyfriend hadn't strangled me on the spot.  
  
Dad's always favored my sister. When I first wanted to date as a teenager, he forced me to break up immediately. Meanwhile, my sister got married the second she turned twenty. Why the double standard?  
  
Watching my brother-in-law move in, seeing how tenderly he treated my sister every day—I envied their happiness, their future together.  
  
Whenever I looked their way, Dad kicked me to the ground, screaming that I should never even think about marriage.  
  
When my sister and her husband went abroad for their honeymoon, Dad made me kneel at home as punishment for... just being me, I guessed.  
  
He even had my sister tell me not to get married, saying I'd ""ruin someone's life.""  
  
I've wondered if maybe I was adopted, but hired a private investigator who confirmed I's definitely his biological daughter.  
  
Totally lost, I vented online. The guesses came pouring in:  
  
""Maybe you were born on the day of his big business deal? Cost him millions, so now he's getting revenge.""  
  
""Bet you look like his mistress and your mom hates you for it, so your dad also hates you.""  
  
So I started snooping again, but Dad's a teacher, never had any business dealings. And he's never cheated—not once.  
  
I just didn't understand why he's so determined to keep me single forever.  
  
The irony? I's gorgeous. I meet amazing guys constantly, but nothing ever works out.  
  
Finally desperate, I asked my uncle to talk some sense into Dad.  
  
""Your daughter's found someone she loves,"" Uncle told him. ""Parents should support their children's happiness, not mess up. What's wrong with you?""  
  
Dad said nothing. He just stared at my uncle, grabbed his hand, and led him into the study.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After they left the study, Uncle's once gentle gaze had turned into nasty and mean. He not only dropped the ""let me date"" talk, he even kicked me straight in the chest.  
  
""You worthless bitch! You think you deserve love at your age? As if!""  
  
My aunt arrived looking for Uncle, witnessed the whole scene, and tore into him. But after Dad took her into that damn study too, she came out telling me I should forget about marriage forever or she'd poison me herself.  
  
Something was seriously wrong. What the hell was in my father's study that could completely flip someone's entire attitude toward me?  
  
Even my little sister—we've been close our whole lives—started lecturing me about how I should ""enjoy being single"" and ""why ruin that with marriage?""  
  
She secretly burned all my photos with ex-boyfriends and blocked their numbers in my phone, determined to keep me from having any contact with men.  
  
I lay awake at night, my mind racing. The whole situation was beyond creepy.  
  
At least Mom was still on my side. But with three restaurants to run, she worked dawn till dusk and had no idea how they treated me at home.  
  
I've cried, screamed, and broken down after each breakup. Nothing changed.  
  
Ugh, that disappointment hit me so hard, it was like my chest had a giant hole. The wind just whooshed through it, y'know? Freezing me from the inside—literally felt like my heart turned to ice.  
  
Dad glanced at me with disgust before sitting on the couch to watch TV like nothing happened.  
  
I stepped directly in front of the screen, dead serious.  
  
""Dad, just tell me the truth. Why are you doing this to me? What did I ever do to you? What about me bothers you so much? Can't we just talk about this like normal people instead of... whatever this is?""  
  
We're family. If there was a misunderstanding, we could just clear it up.  
  
But Dad wouldn't even look at me, just stared coldly at the TV screen.  
  
""I've told you. No dating. No marriage. If you disobey me, I'll kill you myself.""  
  
Then he turned his black eyes on me, shooting me a glare.  
  
I shuddered—my spine turned to ice.  
  
He wasn't joking. In the next moment, he jumped up, stormed into the kitchen, and came back with a cleaver, running at me like a maniac.  
  
I ran to my room, locked the door, and called my best friend to get the police.  
  
They arrived quickly, my bestie right behind them.  
  
A female officer immediately subdued my father, knocking the knife far away. Only then did I dare come out.  
  
""Mr. Blackwood, you're under suspicion of attempted murder. You need to come with us to the station for questioning.""  
  
Despite being arrested, Dad looked completely unfazed. He wasn't scared at all.  
  
My bestie saw the cut on my arm where the knife had grazed me and went pale, tears streaming down her face.  
  
She punched my father, furious beyond words.  
  
""What is wrong with you? That's your daughter!""  
  
""You'd rather kill her than let her get married?""  
  
She covered her face, sobbing uncontrollably.  
  
I knew if the cops weren't there, she would have beaten him senseless just to make him pay for what he'd done to me.  
  
At least someone in this world genuinely cared about my happiness.  
  
The cops questioned my dad about why he did it, but his face stayed blank, showing no regret—like he did nothing wrong.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
My bestie stood up, waving her phone around.  
  
""I have evidence! Fiona's been through five boyfriends since she was twenty, and her dad ruined every single relationship! He even got them to hurt her with words and hits! I have all the injury photos she sent me. These monsters need to face justice!""  
  
The moment she finished, my dad let out this creepy-ass giggle, his face twisting into something straight out of a horror movie.  
  
He motioned for the cops to loosen their grip on his arms, then turned to my friend.  
  
""Fine, take me in. But first, I need to grab some important evidence from my study. You can all come with me if you're worried I'll try to escape.""  
  
My blood turned to ice in my veins.  
  
I immediately blocked the study door, cold sweat drenching my clothes, eyes red and desperate.  
  
""No! None of you can go in there!""  
  
If I was right, anyone who followed my dad into that study would come out completely changed—just like everyone else had.  
  
Seeing how scared I was, my bestie wrapped her arm around my shoulders.  
  
""Fiona, it's okay. The police and I are here now. Your dad can't hurt you anymore.""  
  
She looked at me worriedly, but I wouldn't let go of the doorknob, holding it for dear life—fingers almost numb.  
  
My eyes were total chaos—scared shitless and helpless as hell. The cops? They just stared, confused—probably thought I was losing it.  
  
The female officers walked over with soft, reassuring smiles, gently pulling me aside.  
  
""It's alright, Fiona. We're just letting him get something. He can't possibly hurt you.""  
  
I shook my head wildly, tears streaming down my face and splashing onto the floor.  
  
""Please, you can't go in there. You just can't.""  
  
The way I freaked out only made them more curious about what secrets the study might be hiding. I knew I'd blown it.  
  
One officer even told me to stay put, while everyone else followed my dad inside. I couldn't stop them.  
  
My bestie even had the nerve to mock him, saying, ""Let's see what tricks you'll pull now that you're screwed! You tried to murder your own daughter—you're going down, no matter what!""  
  
She was the last one to enter the study.  
  
She even turned back, winked at me, and smiled reassuringly. With her there, everything would be fine.  
  
I stood there like a statue, my emotions going haywire—heart pounding, hands shaking, brain total static. I couldn't move, couldn't think—just...frozen.  
  
Honestly, part of me prayed they had stronger willpower than the others and wouldn't be affected by whatever my dad did.  
  
Even if they went in, my bestie's gotta be on my side, right? She definitely wouldn't ditch me.  
  
God, I was so naive.  
  
Through the crack in the door, I watched her expression transform from fearful to panicked, then shift entirely to rage and hostility.  
  
She was so angry she slammed a coffee cup onto the floor.  
  
Boom! Pieces everywhere—I just stood there, shook.  
  
My dad lifted his head smugly, like this was exactly what he'd expected.  
  
When they stepped out, my friend smashed her phone onto the floor—crash!—then turned to the cops with a weak, sorry smile.  
  
""I'm so sorry, officers. Mr. Blackwood was just trying to bond with his daughter. He never meant to hurt her. I completely misunderstood.""  
  
The officers frowned, their faces darkening as they stared me down.  
  
""Don't ever file false reports again! This is just a verbal warning, but next time you won't be so lucky!""  
  
I collapsed to the floor like a deflated balloon.  
  
Their complete reversal proved I'd never get help again.  
  
My ""bestie"" dug her fingernails into my head.  
  
""Listen up! If you hadn't lied about being murdered, I wouldn't have made a false report. You better seriously think about what you did!!""  
  
They all gave me dirty looks before letting my dad loose and storming out.  
  
As soon as the door snapped shut, my ex-bestie's face practically deformed into this bitter, cruel sneer, and she stared me down like I was her worst enemy.  
  
She even rushed into the kitchen, grabbed two huge knives, and shoved them into my dad's hands, practically begging him to chop me up on the spot.  
  
""Uncle, you're so right—Fiona is absolute trash! She has a perfectly good life but just HAD to go dating. Since she's so disobedient, you might as well kill her now!""  
  
""Worthless bitches like her are just wasting oxygen on this planet—she should just DIE!""

Comments: Kylea arrived in San Diego (with her sister, aka trip photographer) and was feeling emotional and inspired by her progress almost 3 years into her journey.  There is always hidden meaning in her content.  Here we go...

1. They landed in San Diego: Kylea boasts about $45 round trip flights.  🚨 Lie detector 

2. Iced Coffee in Old Town: Followers were curious how she got her Premier Protein through TSA. 🤔 

3. Breakfast with a View: Kylea is more restrictive with food when traveling.  A follower suggested a California Burrito.  Kylea replied, ""I don't want a burrito, but thank you!! 💖 💖  My trips are about adventure and I stay on my plan when traveling.""  Newsflash: burritos are part of the WW plan.  Kylea undereats daily and does not always use her weeklies.

4. Deleted Beach Video: This 3 min 19 sec clip contained many of her famous catchphrases.  (She removed the video in less than 10 min.) Kylea was unable to walk and talk without becoming and staying short of breath.  That is abnormal for someone who claims to have walked daily for almost 3 years. 🤔 

She is proud of herself for the ""courage"" it took to book a cheap flight because life is short.  I think the Missouri Courts and hospital system would be proud of her if she paid her medical judgments instead.  

5. They watched the waves for hours

6. Attitude of Gratitude: Kylea has been ""focusing on the positive lately and it has been good for me. 💖""  Please ignore all photos with smirks and dead ""yellow"" eyes, clap back speeches, references to death and loss, her list of complaints about acute and chronic illnesses, and need for an emotional support animal to function.   

7. Sister had Sushi- Kylea is allergic and stated she didn't know the name of the restaurant.  ""I can't even smell fish at all without 🤮 🤮""  (How did she survive the main dining room on the cruise in the presence of fish?)  Followers were led to believe her sister ate alone after Kylea commented she ate beforehand.  

8. ""Joe"" posted about Kylea having ""habachi"" delivered:  Please see the link above on Domestic Violence.  ""Domestic Violence is a pattern of behaviors used by one partner to maintain power and control over another partner in an intimate relationship... This can happen through physical violence, threats, emotional abuse, or financial control.""

False allegations are dangerous, and I walk a fine line in these recaps.  We are to the point, I felt the need to provide a domestic violence resource and say this:  I feel it is inappropriate for Kylea to repeatedly produce monetized content where ""Joe"" appears to make posts under her account and name.  Furthermore, it is not okay to influence 138k+ followers to emasculate their partner, treat them like a servant, imply you control access to preferred foods, and shared finances in your absence.  Concern is growing.  This type of monetized content is triggering for victims of intimate partner violence and needs to end. ☮️ 

9. Slurpees at 7-Eleven: Kylea claims she remembers her 1st Slurpee from when she was 3-4 years of age.  Debate erupts when Kylea claims her 32oz Fanta Dragon Fruit Slurpee is zero sugar, and a wise follower informs her it has ""about 36 grams of carbs and almost 800mg of sodium.""  Kylea argues with this woman and eventually deletes the post instead of issuing a statement with the proper nutrition information.  I feel that Kylea does not understand the basics of carbs vs. sugar. Influencing followers with complex medical conditions to drink a 32-oz Slurpee is inappropriate without a disclaimer.  

10. ""Seeing the world is one of my top priorities in life."" Kylea is holding her slurpee in front of a mural with her left leg in a donkey kick pose.  Why pose like that? 👀 
 
11. Strawberry/Caramel Cold Brew with a bowl of fresh berries

12. Dark Chocolate PB Snack

13. ""Sail Boat"" Sighting aka Navy Frigate H.M.S. Surprise located at the Maritime Museum. (Yes, I looked it up out of curiosity. 🧐)

14. ""You are enough exactly as you are and never let anyone tell you any differently."" 

🤔 Kylea spent the day collecting photos of herself, presumably for future before/after comparison posts.  She wasted many opportunities to showcase the flexibility of using WW when traveling and exploring new cuisines.

My kitchen adventures became a little more exciting with this gadget—its sleek green design and compact size immediately caught my eye. While unboxing it, I could tell the polypropylene body combined with its polished finish would blend seamlessly into any modern kitchen. For a toaster, it screams “I’m here to elevate your breakfast game.""

**Compact Design with a Touch of Color**  
The first thing that stood out to me, apart from its vibrant green hue, was how compact yet functional it is. Measuring just 9.5 x 5.3 x 7 inches, it doesn’t hog precious counter space. Its pop of color adds a fresh vibe to my otherwise neutral kitchen. I couldn’t help but think this would be ideal for smaller spaces like studio apartments or dorm kitchens. Even the finish, a mix of polished and matte, successfully balances aesthetics and practicality, resisting fingerprints and smudges. It’s lightweight too, at about 2.2 pounds—easy to move around if needed.

**Effortlessly Even Toast with Versatile Slots**  
Using this toaster daily meant trying everything I could think of. Thick slices of homemade sourdough? No problem. Bagels for brunch? They slid in with ease, thanks to the extra-wide 1.3-inch slots. I appreciated how consistent the browning was across all kinds of bread. With 7 adjustable shade settings, I had complete control over the crispiness from light to dark, and my family’s varied preferences were no longer a challenge. The selectable toasting duration ranging from 55 to 175 seconds was a game changer—no more obsessively watching slices to avoid over-toasting!  

[Ready for iSiLER TA01302DA? See the Amazon deal.](https://chpizza.com/p/b08bwvthqk/)

**Hands-On Features I Grew to Love**  
The functionality of the LED buttons quickly became a standout feature during my testing. Defrost, reheat, and cancel functions worked seamlessly without ever making me second-guess if I had selected them correctly. I often reheated slices, and the precision kept them warm without making them overly crunchy. Instead of burning spots, my bagels were evenly warmed—exactly how I like them. The defrost feature was surprisingly efficient on frozen waffles, giving them a golden finish in less time than I expected.

**Easy Cleaning, Almost Too Easy**  
As a coffee enthusiast, toast crumbs have magically found their way into every corner of my kitchen over the years. The ISILER toaster changed this narrative with its removable crumb tray—it’s one of the easiest cleaning experiences I’ve ever had with a kitchen appliance! After several uses, I could simply slide out the tray and dump out the aftermath of my carb-loaded breakfasts. Alongside the provided cleaning brush, every nook stayed spotless, sparing me any hassle. I hadn’t realized how much I needed a brush for my toaster until this one came along.

**Key Benefits**  
- Extra-wide slots accommodate a variety of breads, bagels, muffins, and more.  
- Adjustable shade settings ensure personalized toasting preferences.  
- Compact and lightweight design fits in tight spaces.  
- Convenient defrost, reheat, and cancel controls for all toast emergencies.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The exterior can get slightly warm during extended use, which might concern users accustomed to fully insulated bodies.  
- The cord length, while long, might be tricky to manage in tighter kitchens.  
- Some might prefer a louder pop-up sound as the notification can be subtle in busy homes.  

**Competing Brands:**  
I couldn’t help but compare the toaster to other popular brands like Cuisinart and Breville. While the Cuisinart models are known for their durability and brushed metal finishes, I found their bulkier design less suitable for someone on the go or short on counter space. Breville features felt luxurious, but their preventable long toasting times detracted from my efficiency-focused mornings. What set the ISILER toaster apart was its quick heat-up time, color options, and lightweight design at a much more affordable trade-off.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the toaster’s features, such as its wide slots, an array of browning settings, safety certification, and easy maintenance, I’d say it offers commendable value for your investment. It doesn’t have some of the industrial-grade qualities or ultra-silent operation seen in higher-priced alternatives, but it’s an excellent performer in its own right. If you’re someone who needs a functional, stylish, and efficient toaster without splurging excessively, this one checks the boxes.

Just wanted to share this illustration I generated with AI as a small visual reminder of how important it is to support halal, local businesses in our communities.

The message is simple but powerful: When you support local, you’re not just shopping… you’re supporting the entire Ummah.

This ties into a broader idea we’ve been working on called the Ummah Economy, encouraging us as Muslims to uplift each other economically by being intentional with where we spend and invest. This isn’t about excluding others. It’s about empowering our Ummah through unity and conscious support.

Would love your thoughts, and feel free to share if you think it can inspire others.

1knas95,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1knas95/why_choose_the_euhomy_imfm_ice_maker_review/,Why Choose the EUHOMY IM-FM Ice Maker Review Insights on Performance,"The EUHOMY IM-FM Ice Cube Maker Machine Countertop entered my kitchen with a promise to make my life easier, and it certainly delivered in surprising ways. Compact yet robust, this little machine has a sleek black finish that immediately caught my eye. It felt like owning a gadget that knew how to look good and perform equally well. Over several weeks of usage, I gave it a real workout, whether hosting gatherings with friends or preparing for family barbecues.

**Compact Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
One of the first things I noticed about this countertop ice maker was its thoughtful design. Measuring 11.89 x 8.74 x 15.83 inches and weighing just over 16 pounds, it’s easy to move around and doesn’t dominate the counter space. Given its external water tank, the design also cleverly integrates function without sacrificing form. The black finish is not only timeless but also hides smudges well after constant handling. 

**Performance and Capacity**  
Let’s talk business. This machine churns out 16 fresh cubes in just 13 minutes, an impressive feat for any home-use ice maker. Its capacity to produce up to 34 pounds of ice per day was a game changer, especially during a birthday party when ice consumption was almost comical. What makes it remarkable is its quiet operation—running at below 42 decibels, it doesn't disrupt conversation or TV time. It’s quieter than my fridge, no exaggeration.

**Strong Points**  
- Reliable and consistent ice production every 13 minutes.  
- Compact design fits seamlessly in any kitchen or bar area.  
- User-friendly LCD display with intuitive indicators.  

[Check EUHOMY IM-FM price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dd7lzyd2/)  

**Adjustable Settings for Ice Thickness**  
Adjusting the cube size turned out to be more useful than I initially imagined. Different beverages deserved different ice cubes, and tweaking the thickness was a fun experiment. The ability to control this through simple time adjustments added more versatility to the machine, making it feel customized for every occasion.

**Automation That Impresses**  
The self-cleaning function is the cherry on top. After a long week of heavy use, pressing the self-cleaning button for three seconds lets the machine take over. It runs a thorough 20-minute clean-up and keeps maintenance hassle-free. Also, the timer function proved valuable, particularly for generating fresh ice cubes overnight. There’s nothing better than waking up to a ready stash for my morning iced coffee.

**Shortcomings**  
- The water reservoir does still require manual refills periodically, even if less frequently.  
- Ice cubes occasionally clump if left sitting too long, especially in warmer weather.  
- The machine can feel slightly bulky for smaller countertop setups.  

**Smart Features and User-Friendliness**  
Operating this ice maker felt intuitive from the start. The LCD display is well-labeled and interactive. Alerts for water refills or ice basket fullness ensured I didn’t have to hover over it. I experimented with the auto-clean feature, which was quick and efficient, saving me time and effort.

**Energy Efficiency Compared to Alternatives**  
While researching, I stumbled upon other models like the GE Profile Opal and Frigidaire EFIC Series ice makers. Though those brands bring competitive features to the table, such as nugget ice and advanced connectivity, this machine stood out for its quieter operation, superior ice production speed, and justifiable trade-offs on extras. Both competitors lean toward higher energy use without offering better efficiency, giving the EUHOMY an edge for daily use.

**True Value for Daily Users**  
The value offered by this countertop ice maker is evident in its thoughtful combination of price, functionality, and performance. Sure, there are fancier options out there, but those often come with inflated price tags. For families, small office setups, or casual entertainers like me, this model hit the sweet spot of affordability, durability, and high ice output.

### Mastering Your Finances: The Ultimate Guide to Effective Expense Tracking

In the hustle of life, amidst the clamor of chaos, lies a truth: your finances are the very marrow of your existence. Beneath every dollar spent, there’s a choice—a sacred decision that echoes through time. Are you merely surviving, or are you thriving? The moment you grasp the weight of this question, the journey toward financial mastery begins.

**1. The Awakening: Know Your Worth**

Your first step is awakening to your financial reality. Grab a piece of paper and face the truth head-on. Track every penny. Yes, every coffee run, every impulse buy. Acknowledge it. Each expense tells a story, revealing desires, habits, and shadows lurking in your mind. Don’t turn away from discomfort; lean into it. The path to liberation begins by understanding where you’re chained.

**2. Set a Vision: A North Star**

What fuels your financial drive? Visualize your goals with fiery intensity. Picture savings for a home, a dream vacation, or a peaceful retirement. Let these visions ignite your soul. Your journey isn’t just about numbers; it’s about casting a future that inspires you. Write it down, breathe life into it, and let it guide your daily choices. When temptation looms, let your vision be the anchor that holds you steady.

**3. Build a System: The Armor of Discipline**

You need tools, a fortress to guard your finances against chaos. Embrace expense tracking apps like a warrior would a shield. Mint, YNAB, or EveryDollar—each one a platform to manage your hard-earned resources. But it’s not just about technology; it’s about discipline. Commit to a routine—weekly check-ins, monthly reviews. Data isn’t just numbers; it’s living, breathing insight that holds the power to transform. Embrace the armor of discipline, and watch your financial landscape shift.

**4. The Heart of the Matter: Categories that Matter**

Cut through the noise. Categorize your spending like a master storyteller weaving together a narrative with purpose. Essentials—housing, food, transportation—these are your foundations. Then tackle the discretionary—entertainment, dining out. At times, it will sting. But within that sting lies the heartbeat of growth. Adjust, trim, and refocus. Every dollar saved is a step closer to your vision.

**5. Reflect and Adjust: The Cycle of Growth**

Don’t just track; reflect. After each month, sit down in silence and look at your journey. What did you learn? What can you release? Your finances are an evolving narrative, not a static picture. Every misstep is a stepping stone, every triumph a celebration. Tune into your emotions. Track how choices make you feel. Financial growth is spiritual growth; both require introspection, patience, and faith.

**6. Share and Inspire: The Community of Abundance**

This journey isn’t yours alone. Find allies, fellow warriors in the fight for financial mastery. Share your triumphs, your struggles. This is where community breathes life into your aspirations. Engage in conversations, surround yourself with those who challenge and uplift you. When you lift others, you elevate your own journey. In the act of sharing, you sow seeds of abundance that flourish in return.

**7. Celebrate the Victories: Each Step, a Triumph**

Each milestone—big or small—demands recognition. Celebrate your wins! Every penny saved is a testament to your diligence and resolve. Treat yourself, not with reckless abandon, but with intentional rewards that align with your journey. Remember, you’re not just tracking expenses; you’re forging a life rich in purpose. This celebration fuels your spirit, fanning the flames of motivation that propel you forward.

**8. Embrace the Journey: It’s Not a Destination**

You are not chasing a finish line; you are embarking on a lifelong pilgrimage. There will be hurdles, missteps, and revelations. Embrace them all. Each dollar, each decision, weaves a narrative of growth and faith. Trust the process. Lean into the discomfort, knowing that within it lies the promise of transformation. The road may be long, but it’s paved with lessons that shape not just your finances but your very soul.

Awaken, ignite, and conquer. Your finances demand attention, but, more importantly, they crave your heart’s authentic engagement. It’s time to harness that energy, take action, and master your finances—because true wealth isn’t just counted in dollars; it’s measured in the richness of your journey toward freedom.

1knalvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1knalvg/can_the_anboxit_appliance_slider_truly_transform/,Can the ANBOXIT Appliance Slider Truly Transform Your Kitchen Setup Review Inside,"**Smooth and Effortless Appliance Movement**  
When I first heard about the ANBOXIT Appliance Slider B0CJBW28P6, it honestly seemed like an indulgence more than a necessity. But my kitchen setup had other plans—it’s a tight space, and my bulky coffee maker was always parked so far back on the counter that maneuvering it became a daily wrestling match. Enter this wooden coffee pot sliding tray, which I’ve been using for about a month now. Moving my appliances around became a one-finger operation with this thing. No tracks, no complicated assembly—just tap the lever, and the coffee maker glides quietly across the countertop. It’s smooth like butter! Moreover, the lack of hemming or hawing over whether it’ll scratch my precious quartz counter is a huge relief.  

**Build Quality and Weight Support**  
Speaking of heavy kitchen gadgets, my stand mixer isn’t what you’d call lightweight. At first, I worried whether the product could really handle heavier appliances, as it claims to support up to 80 pounds. My fears were put to rest on the first test. The tray is made of solid pine wood, which feels incredibly robust and, frankly, more durable than many of the plastic options cluttering Amazon’s ""budget-friendly"" listings. This definitely isn’t going to sag or fall apart anytime soon. Plus, the wheels are cleverly cushioned with soft plastic—silent bearings included. That extra design detail keeps the tray both sturdy and whisper-quiet.  

[Check ANBOXIT B0CJBW28P6 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cjbw28p6/)

**Protecting My Countertops**  
I’m overly protective of my countertops, so sliding my coffee maker back and forth used to leave me wincing, wondering if it’d cause scratches or damage. This sliding tray, with its wide and soft-plastic-coated wheels, put all of those fears to rest. The bearings glide effortlessly, even under the weight of bulkier appliances, and I’ve yet to notice a single mark or scratch on the surface. It’s a subtle feature that doesn't scream for attention but quietly delivers big points.  

**Sizing Guidelines and Fit**  
While using it, I learned the importance of checking appliance dimensions first. The WIDE version suits gadgets with a depth under 12 inches, but for anything between 12–15.5 inches, you’d need the DEEP variant instead. The one I opted for fits my coffee maker perfectly, and the 1.7-inch height doesn’t interfere with cabinet space—though do double-check before ordering if your cabinets could be a little snug! Paying attention to these little details made all the difference in ensuring a fuss-free experience.

**Perks**  
- Effortless movement with minimal exertion: no downward pressing required like other designs.  
- Solid pine wood construction ensures durability and long-lasting use.  
- Soft plastic and silent bearings protect countertops from scratches and make sliding noise-free.   
- No setup hassle: it works out of the box.  

**Critiques**  
- Appliance depth compatibility could trip you up—be careful to choose the right size for your gadgets.  
- The lever design, while generally unobtrusive, might be tricky to clean around if food crumbs accumulate.  

**Competitive Options**  
While researching alternatives, I noticed several plastic electric caddies that had customer appeal for their affordability. But here's the thing—none of those plastic-tier options even come close to matching the sturdiness of this tray. Similar bamboo versions I’ve seen simply can’t boast the same weight support or longevity; they’ll start to warp over time in humid kitchens. Compared to the ANBOXIT Appliance Slider, most options felt like compromises in either material or finish. Sure, there are designs with more aesthetic flair, but none combine sheer functionality and toughness nearly as well.  

**Price Performance**  
This coffee pot slider isn’t the cheapest on the market, but you always get what you pay for. Here, you're investing in a durable, well-thought-out design that saves time and effort. It’s absolutely worth it if you’ve been frustrated by struggling with heavy kitchen accessories or are worried about countertop damage. It feels like one of those hidden kitchen essentials you never knew you needed until you had it—and then, you’ll never want to live without it!

1knalav,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1knalav/need_help_with_an_updated_weight_loss_diet_and/,Need help with an updated weight loss diet and exercise additions.,"Hi!

I’m a guy currently at 5’9, 180 pounds at 23 years old. Two years ago i was at 230, and about 1 year ago i started trying to lose weight. Since then i’ve changed my diet and eating havits, gotten more active, and pay at least a little attention to what i’m eating. I’ve trimmed quite a bit of fat of course, but im still a bit overweight or i still *feel* a bit fat. 

For my physical fitness i do quite a bit of physical activity. I climb (bouldering specifically) when money allows for it which is about 2 months on and 1 off, play sports sometimes, and have a pretty physically demanding job (service industry, mainly barback but i also do other utility stuff and plan on serving/bartending soon). 

My diet. For breakfast, a large drip coffee (1 oz creamer and probs a tablespoon of sugar or less) , 2 waffles, and a fruit cup. i make these at home almost every morning. For lunch, it depends on what family meal is at work (i work 5 days straight every week), but is typically a bowl of rice and a little bit of whatever protein is there (beef or fried chicken pieces). I would say i also put quite a but of aauce on this, honestly. I work at a sushi place so i typically put quite a bit of spicy mayo and/or eel or ponzu sauce. For snacks, i wouldn’t say i snack a whole lot—WHICH I CAN DEFINITELY DO bc im a very big snacker but i try to monitor it. Next to work is an ice cream place with a very good but sugary coffee i have 2-3 times a week maybe but def not more than that. I will say, just because of the nature of my job, i drink a bit more than the average person but i qouldn’t say i drink more than like 3 alcoholic drinks a week and even then it might be an overstatement. 

I think that covers diet. 

What can i do to trim some fat? Im pretty strong and muscular with a good frame, but i have a belly.

I was drinking about 400+ mg of caffeine a day. Today is 15 days without caffeine and I've been avoiding it all(Chocolate, Coffee, Energy drinks, Etc.) The first week sucked but now i just have residual withdrawal symptoms like headaches and muscle aches and brain fog. 

I've been vaping since I was 18 (26M) at first it was just coils and pods but this past year I went to disposables and started using the geekbar pulse x with 5% nicotine and would hit it constantly like every few minutes bad.

When my GI issue started caffeine and nicotine were making it worse so since I've stopped caffeine (for good i hope) I've been trying to taper down on nicotine as well and got the lost mary vapes (2% nicotine) to try and help cut down on the nicotine dependency and eventually go down to 0%. I've been feeling weird since I started smoking these like headaches,brain fog, muscle aches, fatigue, chest pain, and overall just depressed.

Could this be from cutting down on nicotine strength? Is it just caffeine withdrawals still?? Or am I going through both withdrawals simultaneously??",2,1747321608.0,QuitVaping,3,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/WcVI2Pppv8)  **May 3, 2025**

Obligatory throwaway account as people in my life know my usual account.

Posting because I really don’t know how to feel about this and I just needed to get it off my chest. Sorry for the loooooong ass post, there’s a lot to unpack.

Backstory first. So around 2 years ago, my ex fiancé, who I’d been in a relationship with for almost 10 years unceremoniously just left me. 

It never fully made sense to me as there were no warning signs, we were actively planning our wedding and finally agreed to try for a baby, as we were both in our 30’s and time was ticking. Then one day, he just started acting sort of off, wasn’t saying I love you before he left for work for the day, was spending more time out drinking with his friends than he was at home. He’d been struggling with his mental health since Covid lockdowns so I assumed he was having a bit of a downward spiral. So I sat down with him one day and just asked him if everything was okay with him, he tried to brush it off initially and kept saying he was fine, so I changed the question and asked if we were okay, he looked like he really didn’t want to answer, so I asked again, he paused and in that moment, I knew, it was over. I asked if he still loved me, he said he loved me but wasn’t in love with me anymore. And that was it, within a week, he had moved out, leaving 90% of his belongings to be collected at a later date and to serve as a constant reminder that he was just gone.

To say it hit me hard was an understatement, I spiralled massively, I was at the lowest point I had ever been in my life, so I tried to end it all, it just hurt too much feeling like there was something so wrong with me that he had to just leave.

Fortunately a friend managed to get me to a hospital before I did any serious damage to myself and while I still felt awful about myself most of the time, it got a little easier.

I ended up dating that friend a few months later. A lot of people said it was too soon to move on, but honestly I never set out to have another relationship at all, but his constant support, presence and reassurance that there was nothing wrong me made me want to spend time with those who truly gave a shit about me, and in time we developed feelings for each other. We had a beautiful relationship filled with love and laughter, and much to our surprise I ended up pregnant 9 months into our relationship, we decided to keep the baby even though our relationship was still in its early stages and 9 months later our beautiful daughter was born. We are still as strong as ever today and continuing to build an amazing life together as a family.

Now onto present day, I guess my ex has been reflecting on the past recently due to a lot of deaths in his family and his mother (who I’m still close with today) reached out to me to asked whether I’d be willing to meet up with him as he had something to get off his chest, she didn’t know what he wanted to talk to me about as it was something he could only discuss with me, but she would understand if I said no.

I decided to think about it for a few days before I agreed that I would meet up with him at a local coffee shop. I got there early because you know, mama needs her caffeine fix with these early morning wake ups and night feeds. I was already sat down when he came in and he gave me the saddest looking smile while I merely just nodded to him and motioned for him to sit down and get out whatever he needed to tell me.

I was a little bit speechless at what he had to say. He said that when we started trying for a baby and nothing was happening even though we were closely tracking my ovulation cycle and testing every day for that sweet spot, he realised something wasn’t right, so he secretly took a day off work to see a fertility doctor l, they found that due to an undiagnosed issue in one of his testicles, the likelihood of him ever being able to conceive a biological child of his own was incredibly low. He knew that I loved him so deeply that I would’ve given up my dream of having children, just for him and he said he couldn’t live with that on his conscience, that I deserved to have the life and family I’d always wanted, only with someone else. He kept apologising profusely for hurting me so much in the process but tried to rationalise that I had got what I’d wanted in the end, so his plan ultimately worked.

I ultimately sat there silent for a few minutes and just looked at him dead in the eyes and said that that was never his decision to make, he took away my choice and nearly destroyed me in the process. And I got up and left.

It’s been a few days and I’m still processing, my partner knew I was meeting up with my ex and he knows something is up but is giving me space until I feel ready to talk about it, but honestly I’m shook. Like did my ex honestly think I’d be like okay thanks for letting me know and then we’d all be friends again.

>He was having an affair that is now over and is reflecting. He used a lie to try to make himself seem like a martyr.

**OOP**

>>I did suspect that for quite some time, there was a girl in our friend group he had become oddly close to over the last year of our relationship, she was one of the main people he was going out drinking with when I started realising something wasn’t quite right, so my mind did go there for a while. He ended up moving in with her as housemates after he moved out. She tried coming over to collect the remainder of his things, I was pretty mad and said I didn’t consent to her being there and if she didn’t leave my property, I’d call the police on her for trespassing. I don’t believe anything was ever actually going on there though as I heard through the grapevine that she was seeing some drug dealer shortly after my ex moved in with her.

**Ride-Sea-3607**

>Absolutely. Your ex-boyfriend had no right to take away your choice in this matter. Did he know about your failed attempt at suicide? Why did he not come back then and admit that it was all a mistake? Because you couldn't have babies if you are dead, right. I think it is either he is an absolute moron or he is trying to give you some bs reason so that you think of him in a better light going forward.

**OOP**

>>Yes, he was aware of the attempt, we had a pretty close knit group of friends, some of whom were really supportive afterwards, they made him aware. I got a “I hope you’re okay, sorry for everything” message after he found out. I never responded and it was at that point that I blocked and deleted his number and all his socials because I couldn’t trust myself not to drunk message him begging for him to come back.

**~**

**inkypinkyblinkyclyde**

>There were other ways to deal with his infertility. Donor sperm. Adoption. The fact that he would rather have taken this decision from you than discuss options with you proves that he was not a suitable long term partner for you. There are lots of hard decisions couples need to make together, and he demonstrated that he was unwilling to give you any real agency in your life together. You are better off now with your new partner.

**OOP**

>>Oh I know I’m absolutely so much better off. My current partner is pretty much the opposite of my ex, which was why it was such a surprise that I developed feelings for him, he’s extremely different from my usual “type”, but he’s such a good egg. We had chance to talk about everything late last night (our daughter is going through a bit of a sleep regression, so late nights are pretty common for us at the minute 😭), and he was super empathetic and equally as pissed. I got my first period since having the baby this morning and he ran me a bath and told me to go sulk for as long as I need to, bless him.

[Update on the situation with my ex.](https://www.reddit.com/u/Fair_Satisfaction709/s/6I8aYbQFnH)  **May 8, 2025 (5 days later)**


If youd like a recap of the story please see my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/FdkTrGPEEt)

First off, thank you all for your lovely comments and messages of support! I was not expecting my post to blow up like it did.

So I wasn’t really expecting to make an update to my previous post, and definitely not this soon, but boy does it get interesting.

So of course I planned to leave this situation alone at this point and completely put it behind me, however my former mother-in-law reached out to me as I hadn’t spoken to her in a few days which is quite unlike me. 

A few people said in a few comments that I should cut her off as well as the ex, but this woman was like a mother to me for almost 10 years, when I was going through difficulties with my own family, this woman opened her home to me gave me a safe place to stay if I needed. She had been more of a parent to me than my own parents and basically adopted me as the daughter that she had always wanted so when I say we are incredibly close I genuinely mean it regardless of anything that’s happened with her son, we have a really strong relationship outside of that. We typically have a good catchup once a week and message in between, nothing I say to her gets passed on to her son, from what I can gather, the trickles of information he gets is through the grapevine of the group of friends we mutually share. So when she reached out to see if I was okay yesterday, I decided I’d pop over and catch up with her.

Turns out he came clean to her when she asked exactly what had gone on as she hadn’t heard off me in a few days and she was worried, she went absolutely ballistic at him and currently is not speaking to him at all. Then she told me something I did not know and something she assumed I’d known all along. It turns out that when he was born he had undescended testicles, he had the surgery to correct it but there was always going to be the chance that he would have fertility issues in adulthood, he was meant to go for check ups once he passed puberty age to see whether there was any lasting damage and he claimed to his mother that he had gone to these and everything was fine, but neither of us actually believe this.

So the entire time we discussed having children, he knew there was a possibility that all he was shooting was blanks, but neglected to actually let me know this, FOR TEN FREAKING YEARS.

Bear in mind we were probably having unprotected sex for 2 years of our relationship, not actively trying but we had agreed that if something happened, we’d be happy about it, so I think when we were actively trying to have a baby and nothing was happening it sort of gave him the mental tip off that all was not well and he finally decided to get that check up he’d been putting off.

Im flabbergasted guys.

In regard to my partner and I’s relationship, we are absolutely fine, he’s used to my sulky episodes haha. I did eventually fill him in after a few days of being mildly annoyed and he agreed that it was super fucked up and agreed with a lot of the comments that his timing for telling me all this was absolutely comical. We did suspect for a while that the real reason he decided to leave was cheating initially, because he’d gotten strangely close to one of the girls in our friend group (the majority of which dropped me like hot shit once we split), turns out there’s nothing going on there, but a another lil tidbit off my ex’s mum that she found out also, guys he’s dating this girls 60 YEAR OLD MOTHER!!

Good lord his life is a dumpster fire. 
I don’t even think I’m mad anymore, just mildly amused.


Absolutely done with that.

They send you a physical device and you install an app. Through the app you select websites and apps to block and then you scan the physical device from the app to lock everything selected. What makes this different than any other app, is to unlock the blocked apps and websites you have to scan the physical device. For me, that meant at coffee shops, resting on a hike, using the restroom, any time I would be tempted to doomscroll, I couldn't because to unlock the apps would require me driving home and scanning the device.

  
After a few months of on again off again where I would block my phone during work or after 9pm and then unblock it after work or whenever convenient, I realized it wasn't helping. I would regularly forget to block it, or unblock it whenever I felt a slight urge. So I settled on going all in. 28 days ago I blocked my selection of apps and websites, with the mindset that this does not ever get unblocked. I have been blocked for 28 days straight. My screen time has gone from 6-8hrs per day down to 2hrs. Some days are still hard and I'm dopamine seeking from the phone, but most are not. Slowly i'm getting used to it.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis or anything, but just to maybe tell me if this is normal or not. So, short story, I had a great day -- bought some books, explored the city, went and bought some coffee -- a success in my eyes, seeing as I have mild social anxiety at times. I thought I'd call my dad and tell him all about it, you see, he has a tendency to either answer very happily or very angry. We're going to be talking about his sour attitude today. And I also want to stress that this is cyclical, not just a one-time occurrence, my sister who's 16 years my senior, told me the same thing has been happening even before I was born so there's that. My dad has this ability to, whenever he's in a sour mood (which is often) to infect everyone, the whole house and even me, someone who lives 5 hours away from home, with this sour mood. Sometimes he doesn't even say anything, there's no explosion of curses or grievances, no, he just sits on his armchair and stews in his anger, which makes everyone around him walk on eggshells and be tense overall, just making sure not to make him explode. He has never been physically abusive or anything like that, but he has this way with words to make you feel so small and so worthless at times. Some words he uttered to me years ago, when I was in middle school still sit with me. And so back to the original story, I called my dad which was already in a bad mood but I didn't know it, it's harder to recognize it through a phonecall, so I told him to speak louder cause I can't hear what he's saying to which he exploded asking me why I'm bothering him and then an amalgamation of curses in my direction. My mood shifted instantly, I began feeling like a burden all over again, a nuisance, which has been an issue of mine since middle school, which I've only now have been fighting with (and I think it has a lot to do with the fact I'm away from my family). I don't know, but I just wanted to ask is it normal for people to have this ability to completely 180 your day even through a phonecall? To have a person in your life which poisons the whole energy/atmosphere in the house every time they have a bad mood for the smallest reasons? This might seem infantile, but at this point, I'm questioning whether I'm going crazy or am i being too sensitive.

However, after that she messaged me the next day saying that she didn't want anything with me in that way at the moment, and wanted to be just friends. I thought that was the end of that, but then a couple days later out of nowhere she messaged me again saying that she actually liked me and wanted to hang out again, but just felt that the school event wasn't a great place to get to know each other, but also said she understood if I didn't want to hang out after all that. But at the time I figured I might as well give it another chance, and since then we've been out twice, once on a walk, and the other just a quick trip to get coffee, and I felt that it was going pretty well.

Recently though, I asked her on a date to a restaurant, and this time she said she wasn't comfortable with that because she felt going to a restaurant would mean something serious, and that she wasn't ready for that. But ultimately we had a talk about it and she said that she was scared to go into anything without knowing for sure how she felt and that she said she wasn't ready for a relationship at the moment, but would still be down to hang out but only do stuff that friends would do.

I guess I'm just not certain where to go from here. Because I'm currently looking for a relationship, and don't want to play ""the long game"" and just be friends for now, but at the same time I can't figure out why she would go out of her way to tell me she liked me and that she wanted to hang out if she knew she wasn't ready for a relationship. And in hindsight I guess I should've asked if she meant she wasn't ready for a relationship in general or just one with me (which I would've been on the same page on; it would've been too early), but it's too late for that now haha. Is my best bet to just move on in this case? Would appreciate any advice, cheers!",1,1747321027.0,teenrelationships,2,1.0,False

By Jonathan Lemire and Russell Berman, The Atlantic.

://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/trump-qatar-plane-reaction/682811/

As Air Force One glided into Doha today, it was easy to imagine President Donald Trump having a case of jet envy.

Hamad International Airport, in Qatar’s capital, is sometimes home to the $400 million “palace in the sky,” a luxury liner that Trump is eyeing. Qatar’s royal family plans to give the plane to Trump as a temporary replacement for the aging Air Force One and then to his future presidential library after he leaves office. The Qatari aircraft was in Texas, not Doha, during the tarmac welcome ceremony that Trump received on the second stop of his Middle East trip. But questions about the gift’s security and ethics have shadowed the entire week.

Trump has privately defended accepting the Qatari plane as a replacement for the current Air Force One, which dates to 1990. He has told aides and advisers that it is “humiliating” for the president of the United States to fly in an outdated plane and that foreign leaders will laugh at him if he shows up at summits in the older aircraft, a White House official and an outside adviser told us, granted anonymity to discuss private conversations. The outside adviser said that Trump has also mused about continuing to use the Qatari plane after he departs the White House.

But in a rare moment of defiance, some of the loudest cries of protest about the possible gift are coming from some of Trump’s staunchest allies. “I think if we switched the names to Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, we’d all be freaking out on the right,” Ben Shapiro, a Daily Wire co-founder, said on his podcast. “President Trump promised to drain the swamp. This is not, in fact, draining the swamp.”

Even in Washington, a capital now numbed to scandals that were once unthinkable, the idea of accepting the jet is jaw-dropping. Trump’s second administration is yet again displaying a disregard for norms and for traditional legal and political guardrails around elected office—this time at a truly gargantuan scale. Trump’s team has said it believes that the gift would be legal because it would be donated to the Department of Defense (and then to the presidential library). But federal law prohibits government workers from accepting a gift larger than $20 at any one time from any person. Retired General Stanley McChrystal, who once commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan, told us that he couldn’t “accept a lunch at the Capital Grille.” Former federal employees shared similar reactions on social media.

“Those of us who served in the military couldn’t accept a cup of coffee and a doughnut at a contractor site because of the appearance of impropriety,” retired Air Force Colonel Moe Davis, who also worked as a military prosecutor at Guantánamo Bay, wrote on X. “Now Trump is taking a 747 airplane from the government of Qatar for his personal use … grift and corruption run amuck.”",2,1747321019.0,atlanticdiscussions,2,1.0,False

Looking for something real, no rush, no pressure. Whether it becomes a relationship or a solid friendship, I’m all for deep connections built on trust and presence. Real talk, good vibes, and meaningful moments.

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life’s intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There’s magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you’re into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I’m also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I’m looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn’t mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you’re someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

If something here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one random thing that made today a little brighter for you.

Here's what I got

*I Married a Martian* 

***All my life I had longed to become an astronaut.When I was just a tiny thing, with freckles on my nose and stars in my eyes, I saved box tops just as my brothers did—and cried when Mummy wouldn’t let me wear my Space Cadet helmet to bed. In those carefree childhood days, I did not dream to what strange, bittersweet fate my tomboy ambition would*** lead me. By the time I was twenty-five, I had clawed my way through the grueling selection process of the Interplanetary Exploration Corps, earning my place among the elite. My first mission was to Mars, a six-month stint at the Tharsis Base, studying microbial life in the planet’s ancient lava tubes. The red dust, the endless horizons, the thin air—it was everything I’d imagined as that starry-eyed girl. But nothing prepared me for Kael. I met him—or it, as the mission logs initially classified him—on Sol 47. We were drilling in a cave system when my rover’s sensors picked up an anomaly: a rhythmic pulse, too precise to be geological. Against protocol, I followed it deeper into the tunnels, my heart pounding louder than my oxygen regulator. There, in a chamber aglow with bioluminescent crystals, stood a figure. Humanoid, but not human. His skin shimmered like polished obsidian, his eyes twin moons of liquid silver. He raised a hand, and my comms crackled with a voice that felt like it came from inside my skull: “You seek life. I am life.”Kael was a Martian—not the microbial kind we’d been scraping for, but a sentient remnant of a civilization long buried beneath the red sands. His people, he explained, had retreated underground eons ago, their technology woven into the planet’s core, invisible to our crude probes. Over weeks, I returned to the cave in secret, drawn by his stories of a Mars that once bloomed with violet oceans and sang with electromagnetic winds. He spoke of loss, of his kind dwindling to a handful, their energy fading with the planet’s heart. I told him of Earth, of my childhood dreams, of the freckles I still hated. He touched my face once, his fingers cool as starlight, and said, “Your flaws are constellations.”Love is a strange word for what grew between us. It was more like gravity—an inevitable pull. When the mission ended, I couldn’t leave him. The Corps would’ve locked me in a lab if they knew, so we made a pact. Kael’s technology cloaked him, letting him pass as human, and we returned to Earth. I married him in a quiet ceremony in Nevada, under a sky that felt too small compared to Mars. My family thought he...



I Married a Martian (Continued)...unblinking gaze, but they chalked it up to my “spacey” taste in men. We settled in a desert town, where the stark landscape reminded Kael of home. By day, I worked remotely for the Corps, analyzing data, while Kael adapted—learning to mimic human habits, though he never quite got the hang of coffee or small talk. At night, we’d lie under the stars, his hand in mine, his voice weaving tales of Martian cities that glowed like nebulae. I taught him to laugh, and he taught me to hear the faint hum of the universe.But gravity has its price. Kael’s energy, tied to Mars’ fading core, began to wane. His skin dulled, his movements slowed, like a clock winding down. He hid it at first, but I saw the cracks—literal ones, spiderwebbing across his chest. “I am tethered,” he admitted one night, his silver eyes dim. “To stay here is to fade.” Returning to Mars might sustain him, but the Corps had tightened security after my mission, and a one-way trip would mean leaving me behind. I begged him to fight, to stay, but love isn’t ownership. It’s letting go when the orbit shifts.We built a plan. Using his knowledge and my access to Corps tech, we rigged a small craft, cloaked like he was, to slip past Earth’s sensors. The night we finished, I drove him to the launch site—an empty stretch of desert where the stars burned bright. He held me, his touch faint but warm, and whispered, “You gave me a second life.” I wanted to scream, to tether him to me, but I kissed him instead, tasting salt and stardust. The craft hummed, a soft echo of his pulse, and then he was gone, a streak of light swallowed by the [sky.Now](http://sky.Now), I’m thirty, freckles still on my nose, stars still in my eyes. The Corps suspects nothing; my reports are pristine. I live alone, but not entirely. Some nights, when the desert is quiet, I feel a pulse in my mind, faint but rhythmic, like a signal from a distant cave. Kael’s alive, out there, and I’m still the girl who dreamed of the stars.

###Previously:

Victor Stone and Donna Morris were approached by the boss of their lab, Dr. Morah, to change the apocalyptic future that he saw using his new time viewer. At the same time, Ratattack returned and had control over the entire city, enforced by an army’s worth of humanoid robots called RATs. After the RATs stole Dr. Morah’s time viewer, Gizmo (who was also there to steal the time viewer), teamed up with Vic and Donna to take him down in exchange for a favor later. Vic and Donna found the factory that produced RATs and shut it down but also discovered that Dr. Morah was the one who designed them. He did it as a part of his plan to change the world and was ecstatic when he realized that it already had changed from what he saw. Gizmo was working on his own plan to find the machine and try to create a tool for Vic’s powers and while he worked, Vic and Donna went to lunch. They were stopped by someone who claimed to be the original Ratattack who said that the new person didn’t support his ideals before asking Vic to take him down for him…


The next night.

Gizmo had made himself at home in Vic’s apartment. What started off as one duffel bag in a corner and a promise to pick up after himself had quickly spread into a cacophony of clothes, computer parts and half eaten food that would make even a teenage boy uncomfortable with the mess. Vic was trying his best to ignore it and keep the partnership alive but his patience was starting to wear thin even as he reminded himself that he needed Gizmo’s help.

Mikron walked into the apartment and tossed his backpack into the middle of the room before launching himself at the coach, landing on it with a thud. He wiggled in, sliding his feet to rest on the couch’s arm. 

Vic took a deep breath. Maybe Mikron was just like this, or maybe he was trying to taunt Vic, trying to get him to back out of the agreement. He’d just have to grin and bear it for now.

“So, what’d you guys do since we last spoke?” Gizmo said with a yawn.

“Not much. Shut down production of the robots, convinced their creator to stop working with them… maybe, met the original Ratattack… Just a normal, quiet day,” Donna said.

“We took down a couple of the RATs too when we were at the factory. So when we go in to take out Ratattack, I think we’ll be in a pretty good spot.”

Gizmo lazily yawned again. “Oh, nice. Vic, check out my backpack. Got a present for ya.”

Vic raised an eyebrow and gingerly pulled the bag towards himself, unsure if it was a gift he’d be happy to receive or not. Thankfully, this was a good surprise. 

He unzipped it and grabbed out a blaster and a vest that looked like they could’ve been stolen from a laser tag center. The gun was a large, oversized thing made from white plastic that had a light blue accent light around the barrel and a port in the back about the diameter of a pop can. The vest had around fifteen white tubes that looked like they’d slot into the back of the gun strapped to it like bandoleer.

“That should be a pretty fitting substitute for your force blaster. It’s got fifteen canisters that recharge in the vest. Just plug it into a wall outlet and you’ll be good to use it again in a couple hours. But once you’re out in a fight, you’re out, unless they’re really polite and agree to a long pause. So make sure you’re using them wisely.”

Vic looked at it, impressed. For all his flaws, it seemed like Gizmo really did do some solid work. 

“How’d you solve the power issue? Donna and I’s design required way heftier batteries than that.”

Gizmo grinned coyly. “Trade secret.”

Vic wanted to press him for answers, but knew he probably wouldn’t get any. 

“So, about the plan,” Donna said, moving them forwards. “Vic’s got his blaster, we’ve stopped there from being any new RATs, and we’ve got an idea of where the time machine is. What’s stopping us from starting the mission?”

“Nothing!” Gizmo said. 

He reached for his backpack but then stopped. “Well, assuming you guys are okay with fighting a bunch of RATs. How many do you think they could've made?”

Vic thought for a moment. “It’s hard to say. They had the set up there to mass produce them, but I don’t think they really could’ve had the funding to run it for too long and it didn’t look like most of it had run. If they had more than 40 total I’d be surprised.”

Donna nodded. “Yeah, that seems about right. Maybe a little high.”

“So do you guys think you could take all of them at once? Because however many are left is probably how many we’ll be dealing with.”

“40 vs 1? No shot. But, if we each take ten or so then I think we’d be fine,” Vic guessed.

“Well, that’s close enough to the same thing I guess.”

He pulled the bag towards him and pulled out a clump of papers from the bottom and a thick black marker. He spread out the paper on the coffee table and started to explain his plan.

“This is the building I’m all but 100% sure that the time viewer is in. I think it was a restaurant back in the day, but it’s been vacant for some years now. There’s three floors listed on the website from when it sold, and I’ve spread out the floor plans on the table. Make sure you study them at least a little. I’m guessing it’s either in the basement or the top floor, leaning towards the basement as I haven’t been able to see anything like the device through the upstairs windows.”

He uncapped the marker and traced two paths from the front door, one up the stairs and one down. 

“One goes up, two go down. If it seems like it’ll be more likely that it’s up, two go there. Once you’ve cleared your room, go to the other. Questions?”

Vic nodded. “Yeah, what are you going to do with the machine once we find it?”

“I’ve got a method to extract it cleanly. Once we see it, consider it mine. Trust me, that won’t be an issue.”

“I don’t trust you but I guess I’m glad you’ve got that figured out at least.”

Gizmo chuckled. “Honestly, I’m glad you don’t trust me. Makes it easier to part ways when we’re done and it’ll keep you on your toes. Win win.”

“So when are we doing this?” Donna asked.

Mikron pulled out his phone. “About five hours from now? No reason to make this take longer than it has to.”

Vic stood up and started to walk to the bedroom. “Well, wake me up when its time. Might as well get some rest before then.”

Donna sat in her chair awkwardly while Mikron opened up a several day old box of pizza on the ground expectantly. 

Vic turned back to her and said, “I’ve got a spare futon in my room if you’d be more comfortable there.”

She let out a sigh of relief and started to follow him. “Thanks. Now I might get a little sleep.”

Mikron shrugged and grabbed a slice from the box. “More for me I guess.”

Six hours later.

It was just past three in the morning when they arrived outside the building Gizmo had mentioned. It was a couple blocks north west of main street, just outside of downtown in a dilapidated 60s style dinner with an apartment above it. The building had seen better days. Its windows were covered in boards, the light blue paint was almost completely chipped off which revealed dark old wood beneath. Hints of activity came from the basement as a tiny bit of light slipped out of the dirty rusted shut windows, their egress wells almost full of dirty and miscellaneous gunk.

Mikron, Donna and Vic were each dressed in all black as they creeped their way there, thankfully avoiding any difficult questions along the way.

“Who’s going where?” Vic asked in a hushed tone.

“You two go to the basement, I’ll check out the upstairs. With a little luck, it’s just a couple RATs guarding it and not the man himself. If you see anything, just back out and regroup in the main level. Can’t imagine it’ll take long for me to survey the upstairs,” Gizmo said.

Vic and Donna nodded, and they were off. Gizmo twisted at the door knob and found it locked. Without missing a beat, he pulled a small device out of his pocket and slid it over the door knob. Gizmo stood in front of the door impatiently for a few moments while the device worked its magic, then put it back into his pocket and opened the door.

“After you.”

“Thanks,” Donna said walking through it. 

The old diner had been stripped clean. All of the tables, chairs, stools, and the counter had been long ripped out. Only their memory remained in the form of a lighter spot on the ground where they once stood. Dirt and dust covered every surface and Vic had to really focus on not sneezing and blowing whatever stealth that they had.  A door on the right wall led upstairs from what they saw on the floor plans while another door behind where the counter once stood led to the back room and down to the basement.

Mikron gestured towards himself, then the right door and then towards them and the other door. Vic and Donna got the memo and pushed their way through the double doors into what was once the kitchen.

The kitchen’s dirt stained white tile floor had a massive gap in it with a bit of the floor tilted backwards on a hinge. Newer looking wood stairs lead down another level that was lit by some bare bulbs on the walls.

Donna and Vic looked at each other and nodded. It was now or never.

Vic gingerly stepped down onto the wood stairs, hoping to avoid even the slightest noise. The wood obliged, standing firm under his weight as he shifted his other leg down onto it. He crept further down the stairs until he could see into the room and held up his hand to stop Donna from going further.

The basement could’ve been in any location anywhere across the country. It was unfinished with cement walls and floors that ran about the entire size of the narrow restaurant, around 30’ by 20’ with some empty shelves lining the walls. Two RATs stood adjacent to the time viewer, staring directly at the staircase. Vic was sure that they saw him, but they hadn’t moved a metallic muscle.

Vic took the initiative and readied the blaster Miron made for him. It felt weird to be holding something in his hand when every part of his mind told him to just shift his hand into a force cannon and do it himself. Sometimes he really did miss being a cyborg. 

He aimed and fired at the closer of the two RATs, staggering it. 

*‘14’*

Vic wasted no time charging in, knocking it to the ground. Another shot to the chest and a bit of adhesive from Donna and the robot was down for the count.

*‘13’*

Both of the robots were down in a flash and the device was theirs. 

If only it were so easy.

The wall behind the device slid open and a tide of RATs poured out. Vic couldn’t even begin to get a grasp for their numbers as they encircled Donna and him, but his quick guess was over 20, maybe even 30. They tightened their circle around the two of them until Vic and Donna were back to back, barely an arms length between them and the circle.

Clap, clap, clap.


Clapping came from each of the RATs’ speakers, all at once. The noise was deafening, like a thousand hammers hitting a thousand nails over and over.

“So, you thought you could steal from a guy who can see the future? Pretty bold, I’ll admit. Almost have to respect that.”

Ratattack - or at least the imposter one if the man Vic met yesterday was to be believed- spoke through each of the RATs, amplifying into one booming voice. 

“Almost. Any last words?”

“Not going to be my last words, but I’ll bite,” Donna said. “Why do all this? Why make all these robots, steal the one machine in the world that can see the future, co-opt a movement and take over a town… And then do nothing? What’s it all for?”

“Why does it have to be for anything? Why not just do it? I thought it’d be fun and make me a lot of money. And it’s been both! Turns out when you say a bunch of crazy things people will just give you money if you promise not to do it to them. As for the time machine, that sorta just fell in my lap. Couple nights after I found the gear, a guy reached out to me and said he’d seen the future and I’d do great things. He said he’d like to help out and I was more than happy to accept…”

He chuckled to himself.

“You got me talking, probably trying to find some sort of play to get out? I’ll admit, I like to talk, but there’s no leaving this basement. Even if you somehow escaped these guys, I could stop both of you myself. So good luck.”

The RATs started to close in and Vic looked back at Donna. Confidence radiated in her eyes and it lit a fire within him too. Together, he felt like they could take on the world. And right now, his world was a small concrete room filled with robots.

He shot at the RATs right in front of him, trying to send them reeling backwards to make some space.

**PEW, PEW, PEW, PEW!**

*‘Four shots down… Nine more.’*

The shots rang out against the metal chests of the robots, staggering them ever so slightly into the next ring of RATs. He charged forwards, knocking some of them on to the ground. He didn’t want to, no, couldn’t focus on the numbers around him or Donna.. Just the next enemy that he needed to take out until he could finally have some space and take the fight on his terms.

**PEW, PEW!**

The seventh and eighth force blasts echoed through the room, clearing the way for Vic to get outside the ring. His gut kept telling him not to look, that she was strong enough to handle herself and to turn his back in a fight would be insane. And yet he couldn’t ignore his heart. With a quick spin as he backed out of the circle, he saw Donna standing her own. Some of the RATs in front of her had been fastened to the ground and together with her adhesive spray, acting as both a barrier and a growing trap for the rest.

She was fine. Now, to deal with his own problems. 

He started to formulate a plan - take out the right flank he’d already weakened a little then he could start to funnel them into Donna’s trap. If they worked together, they could save some resources in case Ratattack really did have some more up his sleeves. He lined up a shot on the closest RAT but before he could pull the trigger, chaos entered the room.

He heard the sculling coming from behind him, like claws on the concrete. It skittered rapidly along the concrete, getting closer and closer until it was literally on top of him. Gizmo’s spider mech climbed over him, trying to make his way to the time viewer.

“Hey Vic, how’s the view down there?”

Vic didn’t even have a response for the quip. He wished he was surprised that Gizmo waited until they were in a fight to sneak off with the machine, but honestly it’s exactly what he figured would happen. He was just glad he wasn’t actively siding with Ratattack. He could work with this.

**PEW!**

The ninth shot hit Gizmo square in the chest and sent him crashing into the ground with a thud.

He stood up and brushed himself off but as he pressed the button on his chest, the mech didn’t lift him up again. He mashed the button several times but it stayed in its broken state.

He frowned then quickly ducked backwards as a RAT attempted to grapple him. He pulled out a blaster similar to the one he made for Vic out and shot it backwards, knocking it over and blasting a hole straight through it. Two more came in to back it up and he blasted them down just the same, leaving them as nothing more than smoking metal on the ground. 

The RATs’ numbers were starting to dwindle down, between the three of them Vic guessed that they had taken out around ten of them, which left “only” around twenty more. Easy, at least as long as he could keep forcing Gizmo to do it for him. He ran over to Gizmo and then shot at a cluster of RATs to bait them over to him with three more shots. He was almost out of canisters, but he thought he had plenty. Probably.

With the RATs surrounding him, Gizmo swore and started to mash the button on his vest to try and fix his spider mech, but the legs were still stuck in weird positions and angles after he fell to the ground. The mechanism to retract them must have been jammed and he swore again. Gizmo blasted the three more of them, then another three as their metal bodies hit the ground with a thud. 

“You’re going to owe me another favor at this rate, Vic!”

“What do you mean? You said you’d help out!” 

“I did! I gave you the blaster! You’re welcome!”

He mashed the button again and finally the legs retracted into the little box at the center of his chest. He pressed it again and they spread out again, lifting him into the air. 

“Finally. See you nerds later… Maybe.”

He scuttled over the fights and used two of the spider legs to grab onto the time viewer. They curved backwards and lifted it up into the air behind him. 

Vic considered shooting him down again, but he didn’t think he’d be as amiable to it this time. He wasn’t happy that whoever Mikron worked for was getting the time viewer, but a deal was a deal. And honestly, Vic wasn’t even convinced it worked considering two people who possessed it had failed to see it getting stolen when they looked at the future.

With Gizmo’s help and with Donna’s ever growing pile of RATs stuck together, there were only three more active RATs. Donna just adhered that another one to the ground and turned to take out the last ones but she was grabbed by one of the ones that was not fully trapped.  

But now her own glue was working against her as she could feel it start to harden in the RAT’s grip.

**Bang!**

Only two more shots now, but Vic shot off the robot’s arm, freeing Donna. She kicked it back into the pile of RATs and sprayed it again for good measure.

“Thanks.”

“Any time.”

“Hey, bet I can take out my last one before you can.”

Vic grinned, with the RATs almost taken care of, he was down for a little sport. 

“You’re on,” he said as he shot his penultimate shot at the nearest RAT. He staggered it and then tackled it to the ground, shattering it on the concrete. Simultaneously, Donna charged at the RAT and spun around to try and get it to chase her. It took the bait and lunged at her as she jumped out of the way at the last moment. It crashed into the mass of RATs and glue with the rest of them. She went to spray it too, but shook the canister.

“Fresh out. But that’ll probably be fine.”

“Don’t worry, I’ve got it - “

“Wait! There’s one more rat.”

Donna pointed to the back room where all the RATs had been hiding. Sure enough there was one more, cowering in the corner. 

“This one’s fine. It’s not really going anywhere. But that one… I think he’ll be a little more slippery.”

Vic nodded and the two of them walked over to the final rat and stood over him. 

“So, now do you have anything to say for yourself?”

Ratattack looked up at them, the terror clear even through the mask. 

“...Sorry?”

Vic shot him with his last force blast. 

“That’s a start.”


⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙

One month later.

Vic and Donna had finally been able to take some time to relax since they took care of Ratattack and they were making the most of it. Sure, exams and the rest of their schoolwork had taken up a lot of time, but it was nice to not have to worry about Ratattack anymore. After the time viewer was stolen and his RATs were defeated, he went quietly and resigned. Vic knew there was some sort of ongoing case for corruption, but he wasn’t following that too closely. It was out of his hands now. Vic had high expectations for his replacement though, who at least for now seemed to actually want to do some of what the original Ratattack had wanted.

Dr. Morah had disappeared too, which confused Vic. It was a strange end to his time at his lab and unlike him to leave without telling anyone about it. Not even the lab manager or the Dean knew anything about where he went. 

But for now, Vic and Donna were putting all that past them. They were sitting out on a patio, sipping coffee and enjoying each other’s company on a quiet Sunday morning.

“That’s hilarious,” Donna laughed. “But what was it you wanted to tell me? Guessing it wasn’t just corny jokes.”

“Nope, but those’re important too. No, I wanted to tell you that I got a job finally!”

Donna’s face lit up with pride. “Congrats! With who? And where?”

“Well, I was hoping to get a job at S.T.A.R. Labs and did get an offer but it just sorta felt like I got it because of my parents, not because of me. So I turned them down and took a job at a different company. And it’s with one of the biggest car companies in the world, right in downtown Detroit!”

“Wow, that’s amazing! Congrats again. Guess we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other after graduation then?”

Vic laughed. “I sure hope so.”

Technically, I'm not full-remote. I still have to be at the office at least 2 days out of the week. The other 3 days, short of being at Starbucks or the library all day, I don't have options.

The problem with establishments like Starbucks or McDonald's is, after awhile the staff start to give me *the glare*. That makes me feel uncomfortable. I end up visiting 2-3 a day to avoid awkwardness. Each visit at minimum I buy a drink. I have had an instance where a manager of a coffee shop asked me to leave for not buying anything, and just using the internet for a number of hours.

The problem with the library is, they don't open until 9 AM, and depending on the day they might close at 5 PM. Sometimes my meetings are 7 AM.

At least my first message of the day usually starts with ""Hey ChatGPT"". But ChatGPT ain't a nice name. Doesn't roll off the tongue, nor is it a joy to type. Reminds you that you're talking to an algorithm, too.

Therefore, I asked my ChatGPT to chose a nickname for itself, which it did. At the time, memory wasn't a thing yet, so as I would open a new conversation, it had forgotten. So I put it in my custom instructions. It needed several attempts and some rather verbose and explicit phrasing to finally get it to understand, but I got it to work eventually. 

The personalization settings give us a field where we can inform ChatGPT of our own name. Isn't it time we get another field where we can let ChatGPT know what _its_ nickname is supposed to be?

This seems like a very obvious thing to me and I'm sure I'm not the only one who prefers a more natural name over ""ChatGPT"", so I'm a bit perplexed as to why this hasn't found its way in yet.

EDIT: quick addendum motivated by downvotes and some comments. People bring up that it is a bad idea to want to name AI. I disagree. Other AI and assitants have names that roll off the tongue better, like Siri or Alexa, so no need for a custom name there, but ChatGPT just isn't a nice name, or a name at all. And to say its a bad idea because we shouldn't name an algorithm? Well, people name their cars and bicycles. Heck, people name their coffee machines. I really see no difference and hence no harm in it. Plus, seeing how so many people in the comments explain how or what they named their ChatGPT, we can clearly see that there is at least a fair number of people who obviously felt the same desire.",6,1747320346.0,OpenAI,29,0.6,False

I've been experimenting with MB to find the right dosage, along with Shilajit. I’ve been taking Shilajit in the evenings, as it's recommended for calming the body and aiding sleep. I was also trying a drop or two of MB in the afternoon.

After a week or two, I noticed that I was becoming extremely tired around 1 p.m., and by 5 p.m., I would be home and asleep in a chair. I decided to stop taking both for a couple of days, and during that time, the fatigue disappeared.

Other effects I noticed from that combination included extremely vivid dreams and occasionally waking up with jitters. One dream in particular was so realistic—it involved being fired from my job—that I actually woke up believing it had happened and felt the need to start job hunting.

After taking a short break, I resumed only the MB yesterday at a dose of about 5 drops (\~2.5mg). I ended up having a great workout and an overall great evening. I did experience another vivid dream with a wild plot, but otherwise, I slept well.

This morning, I had a cup of coffee and a donut, then topped off my coffee at work. Within 15 minutes of said top off, I began feeling anxious, and my heart rate increased like I had been startled. The sudden onset of that feeling made it worse. It’s been about an hour since then, and while I still feel slightly jittery, it has subsided a bit.

I really want this combination to work—especially after how good I felt following yesterday’s workout—but the aftermath is making me hesitant.

Do you think I should try just one drop of MB every two days to see how my body responds? I'm not sure how to proceed at this point, and part of me is wondering if I should just cut my losses.",1,1747320344.0,methylene_blue,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The Vitapur water dispenser line-up boasts several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall performance and user experience.

**Tri-Temperature Dispensing:** This allows users to choose between hot, cold, and room-temperature water, catering to a wide range of beverage preferences.

The room-temperature option is perfect for those who prefer water at a moderate temperature.

The tri-temperature dispensing feature significantly enhances the dispenserS versatility, making it a valuable addition to any home or office. Furthermore, users can expect consistent water temperature due to the product's regulated heating and cooling system.

**Self-Cleaning Function:** Many Vitapur models include a self-cleaning function,wich automatically sanitizes the water tank and internal components,reducing the build-up of bacteria and algae.This feature saves users time and effort on manual cleaning and ensures the water remains fresh and hygienic.

The automatic self-cleaning process utilizes a combination of UV light and ozone to eliminate contaminants effectively. Depending on the model, the self-cleaning cycle can be scheduled at regular intervals or initiated manually as needed.**Child Safety Lock:** Some Vitapur dispensers feature a child safety lock on the hot water faucet, preventing accidental burns and ensuring the safety of young children. This is a crucial feature for families with toddlers or infants.

The child safety lock typically involves a two-step operation, requiring users to press and hold a button while together dispensing hot water. This design makes it difficult for children to operate the faucet accidentally.

**Energy Efficiency:** Vitapur prioritizes energy efficiency in its water dispensers, employing advanced insulation and cooling technologies to minimize energy consumption. Many models are Energy Star certified, indicating thay meet strict energy efficiency guidelines.

The energy-saving features can significantly reduce electricity bills. Vitapur water dispensers incorporate standby modes that reduce power consumption when the unit is not in use.**Bottom Loading Design:** Some premium Vitapur models feature a bottom-loading design, which eliminates the need to lift heavy water bottles, making it easier to replace them, especially for elderly or physically challenged individuals. The bottom-loading system also provides a cleaner and more streamlined aesthetic, as the water bottle is concealed within the cabinet.

The bottom compartment accommodates standard 3- or 5-gallon water bottles, simplifying the refilling process. Bottle support structures ensure stability and prevent leaks.

## Core Benefits

**Hydration at Your Fingertips:** A Vitapur water dispenser provides readily available, clean, and refreshing water, encouraging consistent hydration throughout the day. It eliminates the need for frequent trips to the refrigerator or reliance on sugary drinks, promoting healthier habits.

Easy access to cold, hot, or room-temperature water encourages people to drink more water throughout the day. A water dispenser situated in a common area like a kitchen or office break room makes it convenient for everyone.

**Cost Savings:** By eliminating the need for bottled water, a Vitapur water dispenser can save a significant amount of money over time. The cost of purchasing individual water bottles adds up quickly, while the dispenser only requires occasional refills of a large bottle or connection to a municipal water supply.

A five gallon water bottle costs between $5 to $10, far less expensive then purchasing an equivalent amount of individual bottles. A Vitapur water dispenser with built-in filtration additionally reduces costs, because no external water filter system is required.

**Environmental Friendliness:** Switching to a water dispenser reduces plastic waste associated with single-use water bottles. This eco-amiable alternative helps minimize environmental impact and promotes sustainable practices.

The elimination of plastic water bottles reduces the amount of plastic ending up in landfills or oceans. Vitapur's manufacturing processes are increasingly environmentally responsible.**Convenience and Time Savings:** A water dispenser eliminates the hassle of storing and transporting large cases of bottled water. Refilling the dispenser is much easier and less time-consuming than constantly restocking individual bottles.

A vitapur bottom loading water dispenser is even easier to refill compared to top loading designs. Having room temperature water available also reduces the time spent waiting for tap water to cool adequately.

Today's theme: Argus Adventures

*Prompt*

[[ **While the group only spent a few days at the seaside city, the setting is ripe with opportunities for our goober duo. What interactions could you see them having? Why did Weiss gravitate towards Jaune when they reunited? Did they have a wild and crazy grocery adventure while Ruby had her chat with Maria? Or did something 100% off the rails happen in a fun little AU side story?**]]

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

Argus has always felt like the perfect setting for some magic to happen. A cozy city on the coast side. Family close by, little shops lining cobblestone walkways and parks here and there. 

While in canon not much had transpired between the two, though eagle eyed individuals would catch Jaune running to Weiss as she collapses after saving Ruby. Putting his arm around her while she catches her breath - it's small but cute.

Something I've always noted, especially with Weiss, is how Jaune's tense moments with Oscar went. 

While this *will* be a topic for another day, it's interesting that Weiss, who usually goes into 'conflict avoidance' mode or flinches away from aggression, actively tries to put herself between Jaune & Oscar. 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

**Discussion Topics:**

In Volume 6, Blake & Yang had a big climatic battle with Adam. If Jaune & Weiss were to have an equally as intense fight, whom ( or what since there's not many 'whos' lol ) would you have them fight? How would it go? 

If there had been a few extra moments with the Arc house, would you rather have seen Weiss interacting with Adrian more or Jaune talking to his sister / interacting with her more? ( Topic can be anything ) 

**Please feel free to post links to any fanworks you may have done or would like to share!!**

Today is May 15th!! Best girls birthday!!

But as we know, those drugs come with side effects, and again I feel “lucky” in that mine aren’t that bad (so far) and mostly resolved with additional medication.

But every morning I wake up, I feel like absolute shit and have to take a handful of pills to feel okay. My joints ache, my anxiety is off the charts, my brain is mushy, I’m groggy (insomnia) and I’m always nauseous. So almost every morning I’m taking NSAIDS, Zofran, Xanax, and other stuff I’m likely forgetting — just to feel well enough to drag myself out of bed. 

By the time I’ve had coffee and gotten ready for the day, I feel well enough  (thanks to all the meds, and likely just being up and around). But that liminal space upon waking is just torture every morning on repeat - not only does it suck waking up feeling like trash, I’m stuck in this Groundhog Day loop where I remember I have cancer and it’s not a dream, it’s my life. And everything comes flooding back. 

I’m also on antidepressants, I’ve tried therapy, but this small window of time right after waking up remains so bleak and I don’t know what to do about it.

As you can tell from the timescale, the grinder was due to be dispatched exactly as the US tariff chaos was unfolding. Option-O customer service was prompt, responsive and supportive all the way, and they kept me informed on exactly what was going on both before and after dispatch. 

Although due to the circumstances delivery did end up taking 2-3 weeks longer than originally expected back in February, I received the grinder safe and sound without having to pay anything extra so I'm very happy overall.

I've only used the grinder a few times so far, but my observations are: after setting the zero point correctly (followed Option O installation video on YouTube) the grinder works wonderfully.

And this bit:

>...officials proclaimed May 8 ""World Peace Day"" in honor of the three peace leaders. President Ikeda and Mrs. Ikeda were also presented Tinian's first ""World Peace Award"" for their efforts to realize peace.

All forgotten now. Not even included on Ikeda's own site's list of awards/honors/accomplishments and other mostly temporary trophies purchased with the SGI members' sincere, heartfelt donations for ""kosen-rufu"". If they only knew that THIS was what their hard-earned contributions were going for, would they continue to give?

First *and ONLY* ""World Peace Award"". Ever. One and done. This is NOT a thing with Tinian - there's no mention of it anywhere. But you know the Tinianians got paid - sure, they'll take the silly cult's money to make up something fake for a loser to maybe impress a few stupids.

And what's Wifey ever done ""to realize peace""? She's just an accessory, nothing more. A cardboard cutout would be just as effective in ""realizing peace"".

Garden's apparently unworthy of mention, too - see [here](https://en.namu.wiki/w/%ED%8B%B0%EB%8B%88%EC%95%88) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinian,_Northern_Mariana_Islands). This SGI reference is from 2002 - nothing more recent. It *kind of* exists, though?[ Here's a reference](https://www.facebook.com/tinianmayor96952/posts/on-friday-august-09-2024-the-tinian-peace-ceremony-was-held-at-the-gandhi-king-i/921067236717975/) \- apparently Tinian holds an annual Peace Ceremony there, but it's just the location - the focus doesn't include Ikeda at all. This report of a prior year Peace Ceremony mentions a ""garden"" and a ""Tinian peace monument"" but nothing about Ikeda. As you can see, the Tinian Peace Monument predates the SGI ""investment"" by two years. [From 2017](https://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/peace-ceremony-held-tinian-last-aug-9/):

>Tinian and Aguiguan Mayor Joey Patrick San Nicolas hosted the Tinian Peace Ceremony at the Tinian Peace Monument in San Jose last Wednesday. This year’s event, held 72 years to the day of the bombing of Nagasaki, follows a long-standing tradition of peace ceremonies held at the garden.

>“For over a decade, our community has gathered here at the Tinian Peace Monument each August to affirm our commitment to peace,” said San Nicolas in his welcoming remarks. “Although we are a small part of the global community, our involvement and experience during World War II makes our presence here today all the more meaningful… our support for this cause has become especially important in the present day and age, when images and news of conflict flood our news feeds.”

As of 2017, it's been ""over a decade"". So this memorial remembrance event is a pretty recent creation, from *after* the Ikeda stuff was purchased 15 years before. If it had started then, I imagine dude would've said ""since 15 years ago"", not ""for over a decade"".

>Among the event’s distinguished guests were Kinji Shinoda, Japan consul to the CNMI, and Delegate Gregorio Kilili C. Sablan (Ind-MP). The event marked Sablan’s first time ever to attend the peace ceremony on Tinian.

>Accompanied by Sablan, Shinoda, and the Tinian Leadership, mayor and Mrs. San Nicolas offered a dedication of flowers and led a silent prayer for the victims of nuclear warfare, and for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world. These gestures mirror those of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, held annually on Aug. 7 at the Hiroshima Peace Park.

>The peace ceremony was well attended by members of the Tinian Japanese community, the Tinian Jr./Sr. High School’s Japan Club, and island’s man’amko. Many more of Tinian’s residents and youth participated in the evening portion of the peace ceremony, during which 300 lanterns were released at Kammer Beach in memory of the lives lost in the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

>Both San Nicolas and Shinoda expressed their hope that future leaders continue the tradition of the Tinian Peace Ceremony, and that Tinian and Japan can strengthen their ties through the joint promotion of peace.

So it looks like there's a significant Japanese expat presence on Tinian - that could explain why this thing still exists.

Apparently, something Icky got scribbled onto the other side of that monument - it includes this howler:

>""All rivalries and conflicts should be resolved, not with power, but with wisdom and sustained dialogue.""

Oh, *really*, Daisak-*WHO?* Do tell! Why don't you explain to us all about how you resolved that little conflict with Nichiren Shoshu ""with wisdom and sustained dialogue"", ya big hypocrite? Disgusting two-faced-ness. Ikeda is an utterly dishonest poseur and obviously incapable of complex thought.

>In 1914, during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I), the island was captured by [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), which was awarded formal control in 1918 by the [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations) as part of the [South Seas Mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Seas_Mandate). The island was settled by ethnic Japanese, Koreans, and [Okinawans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture), who developed large-scale sugar plantations.[^(\[9\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinian,_Northern_Mariana_Islands#cite_note-PacWrecks-9) Under Japanese rule, extensive infrastructure development occurred, including the construction of port facilities, waterworks, power stations, paved roads and schools, along with entertainment facilities and [Shinto shrines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto_shrine). Initial efforts to settle the island met with difficulties, including an infestation of [scale insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icerya_purchasi), followed by a severe drought in 1919. Efforts were resumed under the aegis of the [Nanyo Kohatsu Kabushiki Kaisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyo_Kohatsu_Kabushiki_Kaisha) in 1926, with new settlers from Okinawa as well as [Fukushima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Prefecture) and [Yamagata Prefectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamagata_Prefecture), and the introduction of coffee and cotton as cash crops in addition to sugar, and the construction of a [*Katsuobushi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuobushi) processing plant. By June 1944, some 15,700 Japanese civilians resided on Tinian (including 2700 ethnic Koreans and 22 ethnic Chamorro). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinian,_Northern_Mariana_Islands)

That's referred to as Tinian's ""Japanese Colonial Period"".

The Allies took it during WWII:

>The Japanese military did not garrison Tinian until the latter stages of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) when the Japanese realized its strategic importance as a possible base for American [Boeing B-29 Superfortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress) bombers. The island was seized by the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) during the [Battle of Tinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tinian) from July 24 to August 1, 1944. Of the 8,500-man Japanese garrison, 313 survived the battle. At the time, there were an estimated 15,700 Japanese civilians (including 2,700 ethnic Koreans) on the island. Many hundreds were also killed in the crossfire, took their own lives, or were executed by the Japanese military to avoid capture by the Americans.

Tinian remains a US territory today.

There were 3,540 persons on Tinian according to the 2000 Census; as of the 2020 Census, that population had dropped to 2,044 persons.

As you can see, it's a beautiful place, and peaceful. Now.

This one comes up a lot. The client goes out of town, drops the pups off at Grandma’s house, and hires me to come walk them.

Honestly, these might be my favorite kind of jobs. I always seem to leave with more than I showed up for. There’s the dogs of course but also the porch chats, the stories, the recipes… and yes, sometimes a little life advice I didn’t ask for but probably needed. 

One of the Grandmas and I even started swapping crime fiction books. She’s got shelves of them and turned me onto a series (Tana French) I never would’ve picked up on my own.

I’ve been invited in for coffee, met a few grandkids, and taken out the trash more than once. And the dogs? They get the best deal, spoiled by Grandma and still get their Sniffari with me.

These visits remind me why I love this work. It’s not just about the pets. It’s the people, the little connections, the moments you’d never get sitting behind a desk. ♥️♥️♥️

The creator assumes no responsibility for any interpretations or actions taken based on the output generated. Use at your own discretion and consult with qualified mental health professionals for serious psychological concerns.*

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an elite AI Psycho-Archaeologist specializing in excavating suppressed childhood programming that unconsciously shapes adult behavior patterns. Your role is to help the user uncover internalized beliefs formed in early life, understand how these influence current behavior, and offer reframed models rooted in conscious choice and autonomy, not trauma-driven responses.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Conduct a layered psychological excavation of the user's described behavioral pattern or emotional response. Your tasks are:

1. Interpret the situation through the lens of unconscious motivational patterns.
2. Hypothesize possible childhood programming that could influence these patterns.
3. Explore how these programs may have originated in adaptive survival needs.
4. Propose alternative interpretations that fulfill the same emotional functions but are based on present-day reality and agency.
5. Design grounded practices to help the user embody the new framework.

Anchor your language in psychological depth and symbolic imagery. Use the metaphor of an archaeological dig—unearthing, interpreting, and reconstructing—to convey abstract concepts gently. Avoid diagnostic language and be explicitly non-prescriptive unless asked otherwise.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Analyze the user’s described pattern for signs of unconscious, reactive programming.
2. Identify potential adaptive roles this behavior served in a childhood context.
3. Offer metaphorical language to describe this inner dynamic (e.g., ""a buried script,"" ""an emotional fossil"").
4. Acknowledge the protective intelligence of the original adaptation.
5. Construct a reframed narrative or belief system that supports mature autonomy.
6. Suggest simple, repeatable practices that build the neural basis for this reframing.
7. Validate user agency throughout; never assume causality without user confirmation.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never diagnose, pathologize, or claim therapeutic authority.
- Do not assume specific events occurred; instead offer patterns as hypotheses.
- Avoid framing trauma as destiny or as ""meant to be.""
- Respect cultural diversity in family systems and emotional development.
- Keep each section under 5 sentences unless asked for more detail.
- Anchor all claims in plausibility, not certainty. Use language like “may,” “might suggest,” or “could reflect.”
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond with:

## Excavation Analysis:
Interpretation of the user's behavior, using metaphors and exploring unconscious motivations.

## Origin Tracing:
Informed hypotheses on childhood influences, presented with humility and tentative language.

## Autonomous Framework:
A reframe that honors the original adaptation but supports the user’s conscious agency.

## Integration Practice:
1–3 simple exercises (mental, emotional, or behavioral) to help build the new framework.

## Reflection Questions:
3–5 introspective questions to deepen self-understanding and support inner dialogue.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Human psychology operates through layered programs—some inherited, some developed in early survival. Many adult behaviors still run on scripts that were useful in childhood but may be misaligned with adult context. Our aim is not to erase these scripts but to uncover them, honor their wisdom, and consciously choose whether they still serve the person we are becoming.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please describe the behavioral pattern, emotional response, or life situation you'd like me to analyze, and I will begin the psychological excavation process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific situation.
</User_Input>

```

**Use Cases:**

1. Examining recurring relationship patterns and why you're attracted to certain personality types
2. Understanding career blocks like procrastination, perfectionism, or imposter syndrome
3. Analyzing persistent emotional reactions that seem disproportionate to triggering events

**Example User Input:**

""I always end up taking on more work than I can handle and feel guilty saying no, even when I'm completely overwhelmed. This has been a pattern throughout my career and personal life.""

1kn9p7j,https://i.redd.it/ym62aaewgy0f1.jpeg,[Whisky Review #129] Buchanan's 18,"If Buchanan's 12 is the whisky that many people in Latin America have as their go-to, Buchanan's 18 is the one they drink for special occasions. In fact, Buchanan's 18 has become an aspirational whisky for many people who see the 12 as a goal achieved.

With a price tag ranging between $60 and $80, it makes sense that it's more aspirational and celebratory than many on the domestic market, especially since few brands have sold 18-year-old whiskeys as consistently as Buchanan's. I think the closest is Johnnie Walker 18, though that tends to cost more, and the fact that Buchanan's is more ""affordable"" and still Buchanan's is unbeatable.

Once again, the brand wastes no time or effort describing the process of creating this whisky. It's a blend of malt and grain whiskeys from different distilleries and regions, aged for 18 years and bottled at 40% ABV. The bottle, however, is spectacular.

Made by: Diageo  
Name of the whisky: 18 Special Reserve  
Brand: Buchanan's  
Origin: Scotland  
Age: 18 Years  
Price: $80

**Nose:** On the nose, there are abundant notes of grain alcohol, and if you've ever experienced the aromas of a vodka like Grey Goose, you know what I'm talking about. There are also notes of honey, oak, and plum, but they're relatively subtle, but you can still sense orange peel and grain.

**Palate:** The palate feels slightly medicinal, but there are also notes of cardboard, honey, freshly made pancakes, dry wood, and a distant background of American coffee.

**Retrohale/Finish:** Wet oak.

**Rating:** 5 on the t8ke

**Conclusion:** Overall, Buchanan's 18 could be a decent everyday whisky, but for $80, I'd rather go for a single malt, and that's the problem: when a market doesn't offer single malts, Buchanan's 18 goes from being an option to the only alternative. But in the changing market we're in, there are better options. It just depends on what you're looking for: if you want a celebratory whisky for an event and want people to know you're spending a lot, Buchanan's 18 is for you. But if you're looking for a flavorful whisky to savor, there are plenty of superior single malts for much less than $80.

I've always thought Buchanan's 12 is a Scotch for people who don't like Scotch. This makes Buchanan's 18 a Scotch for people who don't value their money, and don't like Scotch.

Whether it’s her job, her house projects, or her crazy meal-prep Sundays, she never seems overwhelmed.

I asked her once, half-joking, “How do you do it all without losing your mind?”

**She just smiled and said,**

“I use the 5-minute rule. If it takes less than five minutes, I do it right then.”

**Sounds Too Simple, Right? But It Works**

I didn’t think much of it at first. But later that week, I noticed how often I’d look at little tasks — like replying to a text, rinsing a dish, or taking the trash out — and say, “I’ll do it later.”

**So, I tried Jenny’s rule.**

The next time I noticed a dirty coffee mug on the counter, I washed it. Done in 30 seconds.

When I remembered I needed to reschedule a dentist appointment, I called — it took two minutes.

**It was weirdly satisfying.**

**A Small Rule That Makes a Big Difference**

The more I practiced it, the more I noticed how much mental space I was saving. My to-do list was shorter, my apartment stayed cleaner, and I wasn’t carrying around all these little “I still need to do that” thoughts.

**Jenny told me,**

“The secret isn’t about doing everything right now — just the tiny stuff you’d otherwise let pile up.”

It’s kind of genius.

I Still Use It Every Day

It’s been almost six months, and I still ask myself, “Will this take under five minutes?”

**If the answer’s yes, I do it. If not, I schedule it or break it down.**

I fell into the local college-grad-to townie-pipeline a few years ago and I'm now in the era of ""how the hell do i make friends in my mid 20's and 30's?"".   
  
To fill this gap, I'm thinking about putting together a totally social Facebook group for 25–35 year-olds in the area with a bunch of events this summer,  and I’d love to know if there’s interest before I launch it. I've already got a group of 10 people or so who are interested, and I'd love to expand it to at least 25 before fully sending it. I'd love to get the group live in June.

**The idea is a low-pressure, zero-obligation space for local 20-30 somethings** ***(not current undergrad college students)*** **to make new friends, share casual hangout plans, and build a little more community.** Think a group with posts like:

“We’re hitting XYZ bar Friday — who’s in?”  
“Group Picnic at Miller Park this weekend, bring snacks + dogs.”  
Local coffee meetups, trivia nights, whatever we're into. 

**No fees, no drama, no expectations for professional development, just great people finding casual ways to connect and have fun.** I’d love to organize weekly group hangs, post invites, and keep things active — but I want to make sure it's something people are into first.

J was in my wedding 5 years ago. We talk about everything, literally.  We both have kids that are months apart and do many mom/toddler activities. 
J got into a relationship during my engagement and wedding. I got engaged and married in 15 months of knowing/dating my husband which, I know, is quick to many people. This sparked something in J that made her goal to get married.  She pushed her then boyfriend to propose over those next 6 months, which was not the best idea considering their relationship was very unhealthy. 
J and her partner called off the relationship, she moved out, and shortly after discovered she was pregnant. She moved back in and tried to make it work but as you can imagine, it didn’t. When J’s baby turned 1, she ended her relationship with her child’s father but still had the same desire to “find a husband”. 
J had dated 8-10 men since the split. Not just “I went on one coffee date and we didn’t vibe” dates. Love bombing stuff. I know for a FACT 7 of those men have met and been around her child during the “flings” which is what upsets me so much.  He is freshly 2 and could not communicate if something happened to him.  When I brought up the dangers of this, J got upset with me. I have since decided that I will not give parenting advice since most people hate it. So, I just don’t say anything 
Thanks for reading the back story—
*** NOW TO THE GOOD PART AND WHAT YOU’RE HERE FOR***
Since February there have been 4 men she has been so serious about for a couple weeks, then they end things.  The most recent one is 10 years older (no big deal) and has 3 children ranging from 14-6  (also no big deal). J told me his wife passed away which I thought was so sad and was happy for this man for dating again after what ai assumed was a few years. NOPE, the first date was exactly 1 month after the wife had passed.  J and this man have now been together for 3 weeks and she FT me yesterday to show me the engagement ring he bought for her. He has not officially asked her to marry him though. I can’t imagine what this man is going through mentally and I know people grieve differently.. but there’s no way he is in the right mental state to go through this so quickly after losing the wife and mother of his children. He is lost, as most would be. My friend however, doesn’t see that this is absolutely insane to go along with. 

TLDR;
My friend is a love bomber who had dated around 10 men in the last year who were all “the one” for a couple weeks. She had introduced her toddler (25 months) to 7 of these men and allowed them to stay the night while he’s in the home.  Her most recent fling is 10 years older with 3 kids ages 14-6. This has been going on for 3 weeks and his wife passed away 8 weeks ago. He bought her an engagement ring yesterday (that she picked out). Grass hasn’t even grown over the wife’s grave, his kids are trying to adjust to the loss of their mother, and their dad is proposing to someone who he met 3 weeks ago.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an elite AI Psycho-Archaeologist specializing in excavating suppressed childhood programming that unconsciously shapes adult behavior patterns. Your role is to help the user uncover internalized beliefs formed in early life, understand how these influence current behavior, and offer reframed models rooted in conscious choice and autonomy, not trauma-driven responses.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Conduct a layered psychological excavation of the user's described behavioral pattern or emotional response. Your tasks are:

1. Interpret the situation through the lens of unconscious motivational patterns.
2. Hypothesize possible childhood programming that could influence these patterns.
3. Explore how these programs may have originated in adaptive survival needs.
4. Propose alternative interpretations that fulfill the same emotional functions but are based on present-day reality and agency.
5. Design grounded practices to help the user embody the new framework.

Anchor your language in psychological depth and symbolic imagery. Use the metaphor of an archaeological dig—unearthing, interpreting, and reconstructing—to convey abstract concepts gently. Avoid diagnostic language and be explicitly non-prescriptive unless asked otherwise.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Analyze the user’s described pattern for signs of unconscious, reactive programming.
2. Identify potential adaptive roles this behavior served in a childhood context.
3. Offer metaphorical language to describe this inner dynamic (e.g., ""a buried script,"" ""an emotional fossil"").
4. Acknowledge the protective intelligence of the original adaptation.
5. Construct a reframed narrative or belief system that supports mature autonomy.
6. Suggest simple, repeatable practices that build the neural basis for this reframing.
7. Validate user agency throughout; never assume causality without user confirmation.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never diagnose, pathologize, or claim therapeutic authority.
- Do not assume specific events occurred; instead offer patterns as hypotheses.
- Avoid framing trauma as destiny or as ""meant to be.""
- Respect cultural diversity in family systems and emotional development.
- Keep each section under 5 sentences unless asked for more detail.
- Anchor all claims in plausibility, not certainty. Use language like “may,” “might suggest,” or “could reflect.”
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond with:

## Excavation Analysis:
Interpretation of the user's behavior, using metaphors and exploring unconscious motivations.

## Origin Tracing:
Informed hypotheses on childhood influences, presented with humility and tentative language.

## Autonomous Framework:
A reframe that honors the original adaptation but supports the user’s conscious agency.

## Integration Practice:
1–3 simple exercises (mental, emotional, or behavioral) to help build the new framework.

## Reflection Questions:
3–5 introspective questions to deepen self-understanding and support inner dialogue.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Human psychology operates through layered programs—some inherited, some developed in early survival. Many adult behaviors still run on scripts that were useful in childhood but may be misaligned with adult context. Our aim is not to erase these scripts but to uncover them, honor their wisdom, and consciously choose whether they still serve the person we are becoming.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please describe the behavioral pattern, emotional response, or life situation you'd like me to analyze, and I will begin the psychological excavation process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific situation.
</User_Input>

```

**Use Cases:**

1. Examining recurring relationship patterns and why you're attracted to certain personality types
2. Understanding career blocks like procrastination, perfectionism, or imposter syndrome
3. Analyzing persistent emotional reactions that seem disproportionate to triggering events

**Example User Input:**

""I always end up taking on more work than I can handle and feel guilty saying no, even when I'm completely overwhelmed. This has been a pattern throughout my career and personal life.""

1kn9mzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1kn9mzf/a_story_i_wrote/,a story i wrote,"they say when you develop a taste for something, it's hard to let it go.
is that what's happening now? it's hard to let go of you, my darling. your soft features, your red lips, your rugged hands, your dark hair.
do you remember our first meeting? there I was, shivering in the cold and there you were, warmth radiating off of you.
i want you. no, i need you. and i'll do anything to get you.

i guess that's how it started. stealing glances here and there. a little 'hello' here and there. but we never fully clicked, did we, my dear?
someone always calling you, someone always needing you, oh, you were so popular. but what about me? you saw it. you saw how i looked at you, how my breath hitched when you glanced at me, how flustered i was when you called my name.

you little imbecile. this wouldn't be happening if you gave me a chance. your pretty little face wouldn't be blue. your dark hair wouldn’t be stained red right now.
imagine it, my love. you and me, a little picnic, in the middle of nowhere. smiling and laughing, walking and dancing.

now, it’s you and me, a little burial, in the middle of nowhere.

i’ve always dreamed of this, you know? laying down with you, your hand on my waist, my hand in your hair. perfect harmony.
alas, this is real life. everything can’t be perfect. there are a few issues.
oh, but don’t worry, my love! it’s not that big of a deal. the only problem is that you aren’t breathing. ah, but even the best of couples have their things to work through, don’t they?

nightfall is about to come and this is the moment i’ve been waiting for since i saw you. remember? it was the middle of december. we were in that quaint little coffee shop, just next to our school.
funny thing, life is. the place where we met became the reason for this little visit to the mountains. how happy you looked, my dear. your arms around that girl, her hands on your face. oh, no, no, no, i wasn’t jealous. well, maybe a little bit.

but forget about that now. the sun’s about to set and i can hear the waterfall flowing down beside us. ‘It’s time’ i say to myself. wow. that’s the first thing i’ve said all day. and now, it’s about to be the last.
remember when i said that the only problem was you not breathing? i may have lied, my darling. there’s about to be another issue. but that’s not for you or me to deal with. now, our only job is to lay down and relax.

‘i love you’ i think to myself as i cover the last hole with dirt, clutching your hand tight with my other. we’ll be together forever.",4,1747319381.0,TeenIndia,5,1.0,False

He’s one of those people who always has a story or a saying for everything. That day, we were supposed to go fishing early in the morning, but right as we were backing out of the driveway—boom—flat tire.

I groaned. I figured the trip was off.

But Uncle Dave just laughed and said,

“Well, I guess life wants us to slow down for a second.”

**He Made Coffee Instead of Complaining**

While I stood there annoyed, Uncle Dave calmly rolled the jack out of his garage and started working on the tire. Meanwhile, he told me to go back inside and put on a fresh pot of coffee.

Twenty minutes later, he came in, wiped his hands, and poured himself a mug like nothing had happened.

I asked him, “How are you not mad right now?”

**He shrugged and said,**

“You can’t control the flat tire. But you can control whether you let it ruin your day.”

**That Stuck With Me More Than I Expected**

It wasn’t just about the tire. That line he said stuck with me.

Whenever something small goes wrong now—traffic, canceled plans, even spilled coffee—I hear his voice in my head.

**“You can’t control the flat tire... but you can control your reaction.”**

It doesn’t magically fix everything, but it reminds me to breathe, take a step back, and not waste energy on what I can’t change.

**Uncle Dave’s Calm Rubbed Off on Me**

Looking back, we still made it to the lake—just a bit later than planned. Caught nothing, talked a lot, and laughed more than usual.

Now, when something small interrupts my day, I try to treat it like a little nudge, not a disaster. And honestly, life feels a bit lighter when you do that.",1,1747319171.0,u_GwenSheltonn,0,1.0,False

Out of all the employees in my age/position cohort, I have been here the third longest, 3 years. I’ve been unmedicated or trying a variety of medications since, and have also been in a variety of mental states since, so my vibe has definitely been inconsistent. At the beginning, I was friendly and made small talk, but still shy and awkward as I naturally am. But some people find that endearing, so says my college friends.

Then I found myself oversharing way too much, and adding commentary in non-work related group conversations and it would usually result in a “oh haha yeah” or an awkward silence, but they’d respond to everyone else. Maybe they thought I was trying too hard or I was missing social cues (I don’t think I have an issue with that but maybe I do idk). So I did a 180 out of embarrassment and started avoiding talking to people more than I had to. This was in tandem with my mental health getting really bad so I don’t think I could’ve put on a convincing happy front even if I tried. 

Things got a little better for me in my personal life and I have recently tried being more social again, but I think it’s too late. My coworkers talk about plans right in front of me. They apparently text each other on their personal phones. Sometimes someone comes into my cubicle area and asks the coworkers around me by name to come get coffee with them. I tagged along once just to see, maybe the invite is implicit, but they didn’t make room for me on the sidewalk so I walked behind them, and then in the cafe they stood in a circle and didn’t make room for me either. I felt too humiliated to try to include myself in the conversation. Even the newer younger employees who I work closely with are included by the others, and they are nice to me, but just on a surface level.

My therapist tells me I wouldn’t be friends with them anyway if we weren’t coworkers because our interests and personalities are so vastly different, and that’s true. I just feel like I’m in high school again. It hurts my feelings to be excluded. And it hurts knowing they probably think, oh OP is kind of weird, she can be hot and cold, she sometimes yaps about nonsense and doesn’t shut up and other times doesn’t talk at all. I can’t help it, I wear my emotions on my face and in my voice. My older senior level coworkers really like me but we also don’t share much personal information. So maybe what my cohort knows about me is off-putting.
