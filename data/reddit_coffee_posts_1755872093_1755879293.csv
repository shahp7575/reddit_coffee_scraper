Sunlight streamed through the hotel room curtains I hadn't bothered to close. My eyes burned from crying all night, my makeup smeared across the pristine white pillowcase like evidence of a crime. I reached for my phone before remembering I'd thrown it against the wall after the twentieth call from a reporter asking for a statement about being 'Manhattan's Most Humiliated Bride.'
I found it on the floor, screen miraculously intact. As I picked it up, notifications flooded in: missed calls from my parents, texts from distant relatives offering condolences, and worst of all, headlines. So many headlines.
'SOCIETY WEDDING DISASTER: SURGEON LEAVES PLANNER AT THE ALTAR'
'BABY DRAMA: DR. PIERCE CHOOSES COLLEAGUE OVER FIANC√âE'
'101 LETTERS, ZERO COMMITMENT: INSIDE NYC'S WEDDING SCANDAL'
My thumb hovered over Nathan's contact. Five years of my life, gone in an Instagram post. The memory of my father's face as he announced to two hundred guests that there would be no wedding today made me physically ill.
Instead of calling Nathan, I dialed Jessica.
'I was about to break down your door,' she answered immediately. 'Where are you?'
'The Langham,' I whispered, my voice raw. 'Room 1642.'
'I'll be there in thirty. And Claire?' Her voice softened. 'Bring those letters. All 101 of them.'
I hung up and looked at the vintage wooden box on the nightstand. Inside were Nathan's letters‚Äîapologies for missed anniversaries, for canceled vacations, for a thousand small betrayals I'd forgiven. Each one had seemed like proof he cared enough to make amends. Now they felt like exhibits in a case against my own judgment.
Jessica arrived with coffee and a determined expression that told me wallowing wasn't on the agenda.
'Drink this,' she commanded, handing me a venti cup. 'Then shower. You smell like champagne and despair.'
'I was supposed to be on a flight to Bali right now,' I said, voice cracking. 'Instead, I'm hiding in a hotel while my parents deal with returning wedding gifts.'
'And Nathan?' Jessica asked, her tone carefully neutral as she perched on the edge of the bed. 'Have you heard from him?'
I shook my head. 'Nothing. Not even a text.'
'That coward.' She took the wooden box from the nightstand, opening it to reveal the neatly stacked letters. 'Five years of pretty words, and he couldn't even face you.'
The shower helped clear my head, washing away the dried tears and the remnants of what should have been the happiest day of my life. When I emerged, Jessica had laid out fresh clothes‚Äîjeans and a sweater she must have brought from my apartment.
'I've been thinking,' she said, watching me dress. 'You deserve answers, Claire. Not from Instagram, not from Page Six. From him.'
'What's the point?' I asked, combing through my tangled hair. 'The pregnancy test made it pretty clear.'
'Did it?' Jessica raised an eyebrow. 'Because the Nathan I've watched manipulate you for years wouldn't just walk away. He'd have some elaborate explanation, some way to make you doubt what you saw with your own eyes.'
She was right. Nathan never simply ended things‚Äîhe twisted them, reframed them, until I questioned my own perception.
'So what do I do?' I asked, feeling a spark of something other than despair for the first time since yesterday. It might have been anger. It felt good.
'You go to his apartment,' Jessica said firmly. 'You look him in the eye. You demand the truth, not another beautifully handwritten letter of bullshit.'
I stared at her, then at the box of letters. Each one had been a bandage over a wound he'd inflicted, never allowing it to truly heal. I'd been collecting these elegant apologies like treasures, when they were really just pretty packaging for lies.
'You're right,' I said, standing up straighter. 'I need to hear him say it.'
Thirty minutes later, I stood outside Nathan's sleek Upper East Side apartment building, heart hammering in my chest. The doorman recognized me and let me up without calling‚ÄîI'd lived here part-time for years, after all.
I knocked, half-expecting no answer. But the door swung open almost immediately, revealing Nathan in perfectly pressed slacks and a cashmere sweater, looking for all the world like a man who hadn't just destroyed someone's life.
'Claire,' he said, his voice carefully modulated to convey surprise tinged with sympathy. 'I was going to call you today.'
'Were you?' I asked, stepping past him into the apartment we'd once talked about sharing after the wedding. 'Before or after your baby announcement made the society pages?'
He sighed, closing the door with a soft click that sounded like a trap snapping shut.
'That post,' he said, shaking his head ruefully, 'was a mistake. Sarah's mother is dying‚Äîterminal cancer. She's been desperate for a grandchild before she goes. The post was just... a white lie to give the poor woman some comfort in her final days.'
He delivered this explanation with such practiced sincerity that for one terrible moment, I felt myself wavering. This was what he did‚Äîmade the unforgivable sound reasonable, made me feel overly emotional for being upset.
'So you stood me up at my own wedding,' I said slowly, 'for a Instagram post?'
Nathan's eyes narrowed slightly, the only tell that my directness had irritated him. 'I think you're being a bit dramatic, Claire. It was a miscommunication. I was trying to handle a delicate situation with Sarah's family.'
As he spoke, I noticed something on the kitchen counter behind him‚Äîa woman's silk scarf I'd never seen before. And suddenly, I knew with absolute certainty that everything coming out of his mouth was a lie.",1,1755879054.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

So I (21F) just started my first ever ""big girl"" job and it‚Äôs literally my first week here. The office is quiet, super small, and today it‚Äôs just me and two other people in the whole building. 

Anyway, I had my usual morning coffee and, of course, nature came knocking hard. I head to the single washroom, lock the door, and handle my business. A big ol‚Äô coffee-powered log that honestly should‚Äôve come with a warning label.

I go to flush‚Ä¶ and nothing happens. Not clogged. Not slow. Just‚Ä¶ silence. No water running, no tank noises, nothing. I hit the handle again. And again. Panic. I lift the tank lid‚Äîno clue what I‚Äôm doing. I jiggle everything. Still nothing. I‚Äôm on my phone Googling the toilet model (some ‚ÄúEcoFlush B8106S‚Äù spaceship-sounding unit) and reading forums about screen filters and water pressure.

Meanwhile, my massive turd is just chilling in the bowl.

It‚Äôs been 10 minutes. I'm locked in the bathroom. I can't leave it there. My soul is crumbling. I‚Äôm sweating. There‚Äôs no plunger, no maintenance, no escape. So I do the unthinkable.

I get a giant wad of paper towels, reach into the toilet, and grab it. It starts falling apart in my hand. I‚Äôm gagging, holding in tears, wrapping it like it‚Äôs a cursed artifact, and toss it in the garbage can. I go in for round two. It's like trying to collect soup with a napkin. Meanwhile, the toilet looks like a war crime ‚Äî skid marks, splash damage, the works.

I wash my hands like five times, scrubbing like I just escaped a crime scene. I try to clean the bowl with paper towels but it's not working. Eventually, I just close the lid in shame, attempt to lock the door behind me (fails), and walk back to my desk pretending none of this happened.

I'm sitting here now typing this with the image of my own poop in an office trash can 20 feet away from me and praying no one else has to pee today.

TLDR Took a monstrous coffee dump on my first week at my new job, toilet broke, had to hand-retrieve the evidence and throw it in the trash. Still employed, somehow.

Output of dmesg: https://pastebin.com/mUWKcULc

When running my headphones via bluetooth, I have no issues. However, when I try to run audio via the wired jack, I get a loud pop right before audio starts.  While audio is playing, everything is fine. When audio is done playing, after a few seconds there is another loud pop. If I start something else playing before the pop, it doesn't happen.

Suspecting for obvious reasons that this happens as the audio device is turned on and off (with a timeout after the audio stream ends), I followed this post

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1230833/annoying-click-popping-sound-on-ubuntu-20-04

which should have disabled the powersave features (I had to create the modprobe.d directory). Indeed I can confirm that catting the relevant files does show it is now theoretically disabled. However, that didn't help: the pops persist.

I then followed this post

https://discuss.getsol.us/d/9895-pipewire-jack-low-latency-issues

in the Solus forums that claims to have solved popping issues by installing pavucontrol and enabling Pro Audio. When I do that, the audio simply stops playing until I set it back to the default.

However, I've found that if I keep the pavucontrol app in execution it locks the audio device into running all the time, and the pops disappear.

This is a rather awkward workaround that I really don't want to have to do every time I run the computer; the app always being there is annoying as well.

1mxanvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1mxanvz/division_field_log_agent_markham_entry_one_12/,"Division Field Log: Agent Markham, Entry One 1/2","They told me to keep a log. Standard procedure, apparently. Not for me, but for them. Every

word I write, every thought I record, will be combed through by someone in an office I‚Äôll never

see. Maybe they‚Äôll decide I‚Äôm fit for more work. Maybe they‚Äôll decide I‚Äôm disposable.

 

I don‚Äôt work for the Division because I want to.

I work for them because they own me.

 

That‚Äôs not dramatics, that‚Äôs not paranoia‚Äîit‚Äôs fact. They‚Äôve got something on me. A choice I

made years back, a mistake I never wanted aired. All it took was one manila folder sliding

across a table in a diner, and suddenly I was ‚Äúrecruited.‚Äù Smile for the badge photo, Agent

Markham.

 

You‚Äôd think working for the Division meant high-security sites, cryptids in cages, conspiracies

with sharp edges. Maybe that‚Äôs true for other operatives. Not me. They start me out as a park

ranger. Temporary assignment, they called it. ‚ÄúA soft introduction to field conditions.‚Äù

 

So now I‚Äôm wearing forest-green, sitting in a ranger outpost that smells like mildew and coffee

grounds, looking at laminated maps of trails and bear-safety brochures. If it weren‚Äôt for the

badge in my back pocket, you‚Äôd think I was just some guy with a seasonal job.

 

But tonight, I got my first call.

 

The dispatcher‚Äôs voice was clipped, businesslike:

 

‚ÄúCampsite 14. Reported destruction. Witness called it in before losing connection.‚Äù

 

That was it. No details, no instructions. Just a GPS ping and a reminder that I‚Äôm supposed to

‚Äúobserve and record.‚Äù

 

Driving up the dirt road, I told myself it was probably a bear. Or raccoons tearing through

someone‚Äôs cooler. Animals don‚Äôt need a reason. But the closer I got, the more that excuse fell

apart.

 

The forest was quiet. Not the natural kind of quiet either‚Äîthe wrong kind. No owls, no crickets,

not even wind in the branches. Just the crunch of my boots and the groan of my flashlight beam

cutting through pine trunks.

 

When I reached the campsite, my stomach dropped.

 

The tents weren‚Äôt just knocked over. They were shredded‚Äîripped open like paper, the nylon

hanging in ribbons. Sleeping bags gutted, foam insulation scattered. A cooler crushed flat as if

stomped by something huge.

 

And then there were the claw marks.

 

 

Four deep grooves, carved into the side of a picnic table. Too wide for a bear. Too deliberate.

 

I crouched down, running the light across the ground. The dirt was torn up in arcs, like

something had circled the site again and again. Whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt hunting for food. It

was‚Ä¶playing. Testing.

 

And the smell‚Äî

God. Musky, coppery, like wet fur and blood drying under the sun.

 

I don‚Äôt want to write this part down, but I will. Because if I leave it out, I‚Äôll be lying, and they‚Äôll

know.

 

There were prints.

Dog-like, but wrong. Too big. Too deep. And at the edges of the pads, where there should‚Äôve

been claws, there were gouges in the dirt, like something sharper had dug in.

 

Dogman.

 

I‚Äôve read the files they don‚Äôt want you to know exist. Sketches passed off as hoaxes, reports

buried in evidence lockers. Most agents laugh about them. But I‚Äôve seen enough now to know

the stories are real. And if one of those things was here, then I‚Äôm already too close.

 

The hairs on my arms rose as I stood there, flashlight sweeping the tree line. The woods felt

thicker than before, pressing in. I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought that I wasn‚Äôt alone.

 

That maybe the call wasn‚Äôt about what had happened here.

But what was still here now.

 

I told myself I‚Äôd only do a quick sweep. Five minutes, maybe ten. Just enough to see if there

were tracks leading away. If anyone survived, I couldn‚Äôt just sit on my hands while they bled out

in the trees.

 

That‚Äôs the lie I told myself. The truth?

I wanted proof. Proof that I wasn‚Äôt imagining those claw marks, that the stories weren‚Äôt just

stories. Proof that I wasn‚Äôt wasting my life working for people who had me by the throat.

 

So I clicked the flashlight to high and started moving.

 

The dirt road was nothing but torn ground, loops and arcs of scuffed soil, too chaotic to follow.

But ten yards into the treeline, I saw it: a depression in the moss, heavy, wide, too clean to be

anything but deliberate. A footprint.

 

 

The beam washed over it, trembling in my hand. The print was fresh. Damp earth still glistened

at the edges. The thing that made it couldn‚Äôt have been more than an hour ahead of me. Maybe

less.

 

And it wasn‚Äôt alone.

 

I swung the light wider and saw more, overlapping in the loam‚Äîsome big, some smaller, as if

whatever had destroyed the campsite had been joined by others. Packs. Dogmen were said to

hunt in them.

 

My throat tightened.

 

‚ÄúStay calm,‚Äù I muttered, more to the trees than to myself. The sound came out too loud, too

sharp, and the woods seemed to swallow it whole.

 

Then came the smell again. Stronger this time. Wet fur. Copper. Rot.

 

The flashlight beam shuddered as I moved it between the trunks. That‚Äôs when I noticed the

silence wasn‚Äôt complete after all. There was a sound underneath it‚Äîso low, so deep, I hadn‚Äôt

realized I was hearing it until I stopped walking.

 

Breathing.

 

Not mine.

 

Slow, heavy pulls of air. Inhale. Exhale. Almost like the trees themselves were alive, breathing in

rhythm with each other.

 

I turned, sweeping the light, and for a fraction of a second I thought I caught eyeshine‚Äîtwo pale

dots between the trees, too high off the ground for any wolf. They blinked out as fast as they

came.

 

My hand tightened around the Division-issued sidearm I wasn‚Äôt even supposed to unholster

unless commanded. The plastic grip was slick with sweat.

 

I should‚Äôve stopped. I should‚Äôve backed away. But something in me‚Äîpride, stubbornness, or

maybe just the weight of the blackmail folder still hanging over my life‚Äîkept me moving forward.

 

I crouched low, pressing the light down onto the ground. The prints continued deeper into the

forest, dragging streaks in the moss where claws had raked against stone. My pulse hammered

in my throat. Every step made me feel smaller.

 

And then I found it.

 

 

At the base of a pine, half-buried in the needles, lay a scrap of fabric. Red. Nylon. Torn from a

jacket. Human-sized. Fresh blood crusted the edges.

 

That was when the breathing stopped.

 

The forest froze with it. Not quiet this time‚Äîdead. No air, no sound, like the entire world had

been put on pause. I hadn‚Äôt realized how much comfort there was in the background noise of life

until it was gone.

 

And then, from behind me‚Äî

A crunch.

 

Just one. A single footstep, deliberate, heavy, close enough that I felt it through the ground.

 

I didn‚Äôt turn. Couldn‚Äôt. Every nerve in my body locked.

 

Something was here. And it was waiting for me to make the first move.

 

I froze.

 

Not a muscle, not a twitch. Even the flashlight, clutched in my hand, stayed locked on the scrap

of red fabric like it was the only thing anchoring me in this world.

 

My lungs screamed to pull air, but I didn‚Äôt let them. If I breathed, it would hear me. If I moved, it

would see me. All I could do was try to become a shadow in the pines.

 

Behind me, the silence stretched‚Äîso heavy it was unbearable. And then came the sound

again.

 

Not footsteps this time.

 

Sniffing.

 

Long, deliberate draws of air, wet and animal. It was close. So close I could almost feel the

warmth of it on the back of my neck, even though I knew that had to be my mind playing tricks.

 

I counted the seconds in my head. One. Two. Three. Hoping it would move on. Hoping it would

decide I wasn‚Äôt worth it.

 

Instead, the sniffing grew louder. Closer.

 

And then came the low rumble.

 

 

It wasn‚Äôt a growl, not exactly. More like something was testing its throat. The kind of sound

predators make when they‚Äôre still deciding if you‚Äôre prey. My skin prickled, the hair along my

arms and neck rising as though my body already knew the answer.

 

I told myself to stay still. To wait it out. Division protocols were clear: don‚Äôt engage unless you

absolutely must. But protocols don‚Äôt prepare you for the way your instincts scream at you to run.

 

The rumble cut off.

 

For a heartbeat, there was nothing. Then I heard it lean in. The sound of weight shifting, of pine

needles and soil compressing under something massive. The exhale that rolled against my ear

was hot. Real. Not my imagination.

 

It was right behind me.

 

The world spun into a tunnel‚Äîjust me, the scrap of bloodied fabric in front of me, and the thing

breathing down my back. My vision swam. My heartbeat felt like a gunshot in my chest.

 

And then‚Äîsnap.

 

A branch cracked off to my right, deeper in the forest. The thing shifted. The sound of claws on

bark, then movement‚Äîfast, heavy, pounding away through the trees. The breathing vanished

with it.

 

I collapsed to my knees, gasping like I‚Äôd been underwater for minutes. My flashlight beam shook

violently as I tried to steady it, washing over empty trees that only moments ago had held

something I wasn‚Äôt meant to see.

 

But it hadn‚Äôt left me by chance. I knew that as clearly as I knew my own name. It left because it

wanted to.

 

Because something else out there had caught its attention.

 

I wasn‚Äôt proud of it, but I knew when to fold.

 

Whatever was out there‚ÄîDogman or something worse‚Äîit hadn‚Äôt killed me when it could have.

That wasn‚Äôt luck. That was choice. And the thing about predators that choose is they don‚Äôt

forget what they pass up.

 

My scent was in the soil now. My fear written in the sweat soaking through my shirt. It could find

me whenever it wanted.

 

So I pulled in one last ragged breath, killed the flashlight, and started moving.

 

 

The dark swallowed me whole. My eyes strained against it, catching the faintest outlines of

trees and undergrowth. Every step felt louder than a gunshot. My boots pressed into pine

needles that crunched like brittle bones.

 

I tried to walk steady, but my body betrayed me‚Äîknees locking, calves shaking, like they

belonged to someone who already knew they weren‚Äôt getting out.

 

And with every step, I imagined it. Pacing me. Low to the ground, gliding between the trunks.

Snout raised, nostrils twitching, tracking me by the heat coming off my skin.

 

The silence pressed tighter the farther I got from the campsite. No frogs. No birds. Not even the

faint hum of night insects. Just me and the suspicion that silence wasn‚Äôt absence but design.

 

The forest wanted me to hear only it.

 

Halfway back to the road, I felt the shift.

 

The air grew heavier‚Äîthicker, like I was walking into the breath of something enormous. My

chest tightened. It wasn‚Äôt just nerves. The smell was back. Damp fur. Rust.

 

I stopped.

 

Behind me: nothing. But I knew better than to trust nothing. My hand drifted toward the sidearm

holstered at my waist. But pulling it meant I was committed, and I wasn‚Äôt ready to commit to a

fight I couldn‚Äôt win.

 

So I pushed on.

 

The minutes stretched into small eternities. My watch ticked, each second stabbing louder than

the last. My heartbeat hammered against my eardrums so fiercely it felt like it would give me

away.

 

The ranger road appeared ahead, pale dirt cutting a line through the black trees. Relief nearly

buckled my knees. If I could reach the truck, if I could just turn the key, I could put a mile of

gravel between me and this nightmare.

 

But relief can be a trap.

 

The moment I stepped out onto the road, I felt it.

 

Eyes.

 

Not imagined. Not paranoia. Real. Watching from the treeline.

 

 

I didn‚Äôt turn to confirm. Didn‚Äôt need to. The weight of its stare was heavy enough to bend my

shoulders. My instincts screamed to run, to sprint for the truck, but I forced myself to walk. Fast,

steady, but not panicked. Prey runs. Predators chase.

 

My hand brushed against the truck door handle, slick with dew. I yanked it open, climbed in, and

only when the lock clicked behind me did I finally breathe.

 

I fumbled the keys into the ignition. The engine coughed, caught, and roared far too loud for the

stillness of the night.

 

The headlights flicked on, stabbing into the forest.

 

For a second, I swore I saw it.

 

A silhouette between the trees. Upright. Massive. Shoulders hunched, head tilting unnaturally to

one side as though studying me.

 

And then‚Äîgone.

 

Whether it stepped back into shadow or was never really there, I‚Äôll never know.

 

I drove back to the ranger station with my hands shaking so badly I nearly went off the road

twice. The whole way, I felt those eyes in my rearview mirror. Never catching a glimpse, but

never shaking the certainty, either.

 

When I finally parked and killed the engine, I sat there in the dark for a long time. Just listening.

Just waiting for the crunch of footsteps outside my door.

 

But nothing came.

 

For now.

 

I know what Division‚Äôs going to say when they read this. That I failed to follow through. That I

retreated when I should‚Äôve documented. That I let fear make the call.

 

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äî

Fear kept me alive tonight.

 

And I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that whatever I saw, whatever let me live, was just a warning shot.

 

I filed the report straight. Every word of it.

 

The claw marks. The prints. The breathing. The eyes. I even wrote that I froze‚Äîbecause lying

on paper would come back to bite me worse than any cryptid ever could.

 

 

I expected the fallout. Maybe a transfer to a desk. Maybe a quiet ‚Äúdisposal‚Äù out in the woods.

But that‚Äôs not what happened.

 

Two days later, a black SUV rolled up to the ranger station. Dark-tinted windows, no plates.

Three Division personnel climbed out‚Äîtwo in field gear, rifles slung, and one in a long coat that

didn‚Äôt belong in the forest. They didn‚Äôt bother introducing themselves. Division doesn‚Äôt do

names, not with people like me.

 

The one in the coat just said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll lead us to the site.‚Äù

 

So I did.

 

The campsite looked worse in daylight. The shredded tents had stiffened in the cold, nylon

edges curled and brittle like dead skin. The claw marks on the picnic table were still raw in the

wood, deep enough to catch the morning light.

 

One of the operatives crouched low, pressing gloved fingers into the dirt near the firepit. ‚ÄúNot a

bear,‚Äù he muttered. His partner grunted in agreement, scanning the treeline with his rifle up like

he expected something to step out any second.

 

The one in the coat walked slow, deliberate, eyes moving from ground to tree line to sky, as

though the evidence didn‚Äôt stop at human height. I caught him staring at the claw marks longer

than he should‚Äôve. His face didn‚Äôt show fear, exactly‚Äîbut something flickered there.

Recognition, maybe.

 

‚ÄúAgent Markham,‚Äù he said without looking at me. ‚ÄúShow me where you found the fabric.‚Äù

 

I led them deeper into the trees. The fabric was still there, half-buried in pine needles. But it

wasn‚Äôt alone anymore.

 

Something else lay beside it.

 

A rib bone. Human.

 

Stripped clean. Not gnawed, not shattered. Peeled. Like something had taken its time.

 

The air grew heavier. Even the operatives stiffened at the sight. One of them muttered,

‚ÄúChrist‚Ä¶‚Äù before catching himself.

 

I turned my flashlight beam down on the ground, and that‚Äôs when I noticed the soil wasn‚Äôt just

disturbed‚Äîit was layered. Drag marks. Several. As if more than one body had been pulled

through here, deep into the forest.

 

 

The smell rolled in with it. Musky. Copper. Damp. My stomach clenched as I realized it was the

same stench from the night I nearly died, only worse‚Äîthicker, like it had been baking in the

trees for days.

 

The one in the coat crouched down beside the bone. He didn‚Äôt touch it, just stared. His voice

was flat when he spoke:

‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt an isolated incident. This site has been used before.‚Äù

 

One of the operatives spoke up. ‚ÄúSir, recommend immediate containment protocols.‚Äù

 

He didn‚Äôt answer. He was staring past the fabric, past the bone, into the shadowed stretch of

trees where the drag marks disappeared.

 

‚ÄúContainment won‚Äôt be possible,‚Äù he said finally. His tone wasn‚Äôt fear. It was worse‚Äîcertainty.

 

We pushed deeper. Against every instinct screaming at me to stop, we followed the drag marks

into a low ravine where the trees grew denser. The farther we went, the more the forest

felt‚Ä¶wrong. Birds gave us a wide berth. Not a single insect buzzed in the air. The silence

thickened until the crunch of boots on soil felt like desecration.

 

Then we found it.

 

A den.

 

Not a cave, not exactly. Just a hollow carved into the earth beneath a tangle of roots, dark

enough the sunlight couldn‚Äôt reach inside. The smell hit us like a wall. Rot and fur and

something chemical, like ammonia.

 

One of the operatives gagged behind his mask.

 

Bones littered the ground outside. Some animal, most human. Jaws unhinged, sockets empty.

Many of them clean‚Äîpicked with precision. But others‚Ä¶ others had been rearranged.

 

Skulls stacked in a crude spiral. Femurs jammed into the dirt like stakes. A ribcage bent

backward and lashed into a shape that looked almost like wings.

 

We weren‚Äôt looking at kills.

We were looking at‚Ä¶ an arrangement.

 

The one in the coat finally spoke, voice low enough that we had to strain to hear.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs marking territory. But not for its own kind.‚Äù

 

Something moved in the den.

 

 

A scrape. A shift. The sound of claws on stone.

 

Every rifle came up. My chest locked as a shape stirred in the dark. Not stepping out. Not

revealing itself. Just‚Ä¶ letting us know it was there.

 

The breathing rolled out of the hollow, long and deliberate, carrying across the ravine like the

forest itself had exhaled.

 

The Division personnel, hardened men in armor, didn‚Äôt advance. Didn‚Äôt speak. One even

lowered his rifle an inch, as though shooting would only make it worse.

 

I felt it too‚Äîthat primal, bone-deep understanding that this wasn‚Äôt just an animal. It wasn‚Äôt just a

Dogman.

 

It was something bigger.

Something older.

 

I should have ordered the retreat. God knows every fiber in my body begged for it. But I stayed.

 

We all did.

 

No one said the words. No one had to. The rifles shook slightly in their owners‚Äô hands, the long

coat‚Äôs face stayed taut, and my own legs felt nailed to the ground. But none of us moved. It was

as if the den itself had rooted us there, daring us to look away.

 

I thought the breathing was bad.

I was wrong.

 

What came next wasn‚Äôt sound. Not exactly. It was vibration‚Äîlow, grinding, bone-deep. A

pressure that wormed into my teeth and made my fillings ache. My vision fuzzed at the edges. It

felt like the thing inside was humming through the earth itself, and the forest was acting like a

drum.

 

One of the operatives whispered something‚Äîjust a single word. A prayer, maybe. His voice

cracked halfway through, too brittle to carry.

 

That‚Äôs when it shifted forward.

 

The first thing I saw was the claws.

 

Not hands. Not paws. Something between, stretched and blackened, each talon thick as a

carving knife and glistening like wet obsidian. They dug furrows into the soil as it pulled itself

closer to the light.

 

 

The smell rolled out with it‚Äîrank fur, copper blood, and something off. Like burnt hair mixed

with chemical solvent. It wasn‚Äôt just an animal‚Äôs stink; it was deliberate. A warning. A claim.

 

The head followed.

 

At first glance, it was a wolf‚Äôs silhouette. Elongated snout, ears pricked forward. But the

proportions were wrong. Too tall. Too narrow. Like someone had sculpted the idea of a wolf from

memory and got the details slightly‚Ä¶ twisted. The teeth were too long, overlapping outside its

jaw like tusks forced to fit a mouth too small.

 

Its eyes caught the daylight‚Äîif they were eyes. The sockets glowed faintly, not reflective like an

animal‚Äôs, but emitting something. Pale, milky light, like the fogged-over stare of a corpse.

 

I wanted to blink, but my body refused. I couldn‚Äôt even breathe right. Every inhale shuddered

like I was stealing air from something that owned it first.

 

And then it spoke.

 

Not in words. God help me, that would‚Äôve been easier. What came out was layered noise‚Äîlow

growl, high-pitched whine, and something human caught between. Like dozens of voices trying

to harmonize but tearing each other apart in the process.

 

The meaning wasn‚Äôt clear, but the intent was.

It knew we were here.

And it was telling us we didn‚Äôt belong.

 

The operative nearest me lost it. He shouted‚Äîa raw, panicked sound‚Äîand opened fire into the

den. The muzzle flash lit the hollow in stuttering bursts, every crack of the rifle echoing like

thunder in the ravine.

 

For half a heartbeat, I thought maybe the noise would drive it back. Maybe bullets would still

mean something.

 

Then the thing moved.

 

Faster than anything that size should‚Äôve been. One second it was inside, the next it was at the

mouth of the den, a hulking shadow blotting out the roots above. Bullets struck, but they didn‚Äôt

stop it. They sank in, tore furrows through flesh that didn‚Äôt bleed right‚Äîoozing thick, dark fluid

that steamed against the ground.

 

The operatives fired in panicked bursts. The one in the coat barked orders I couldn‚Äôt even hear

over the cacophony. And me? I just watched. Frozen. Not because I wanted to, but because I

couldn‚Äôt look away.

 

 

Because the thing wasn‚Äôt attacking.

 

It could have. God knows it could have ripped through us like paper. Instead, it stood there.

Bullets tearing into it, claws flexing, eyes glowing with corpse-light, and it just looked at us.

 

As if we were the ones being tested.

 

And then‚Äîlike a nightmare folding back into itself‚Äîit retreated. Slowly, deliberately. Back into

the dark.

 

The gunfire trailed off into ringing silence. Smoke hung low in the ravine. The smell clung to my

clothes like it had seeped into the fibers.

 

We didn‚Äôt follow. None of us even suggested it.

 

The one in the coat finally spoke, voice tight and deliberate, like he was forcing the words out.

‚ÄúSeal the site. No further entry.‚Äù

 

The operatives nodded, but I caught the look in their eyes. That hollow, wide stare that said they

hadn‚Äôt just seen something frightening‚Äîthey‚Äôd seen something that didn‚Äôt fit. Something that

shouldn‚Äôt exist.

 

And me?

 

I‚Äôm writing this with hands that won‚Äôt stop shaking. Because I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the way it

stood there. Bullets sinking in, glowing eyes fixed on me like it knew my name.

 

And worst of all‚Äî

It let us go.

 

I thought sealing the site would mean closure. Drop tarps, string tape, haul in concrete barriers.

Pretend the thing inside was just another problem boxed away.

 

But nothing about this felt like closure.

 

It felt like a funeral where the corpse was still breathing.

 

The Division men worked fast. Packs of rebar and collapsible barricades came out of the SUV‚Äôs

trunk like this wasn‚Äôt their first time walling something off in the woods. They dug in steel posts,

unrolled heavy fencing.

 

Me? I hauled chain links, hammered posts, sweat dripping cold under my shirt. My arms

trembled‚Äînot from the labor, but from the fact that every clang of metal, every grunt of effort,

echoed down into that den.

 

 

And every sound felt noticed.

 

The long-coat supervisor barked orders without looking at us. ‚ÄúDouble reinforcement. Anchor

the gate. No gaps.‚Äù His voice was firm, but I caught the twitch in his jaw when a clawed scrape

echoed from inside. Not an attack. Not an escape. Just a reminder.

 

It was still in there.

 

Watching.

 

An hour in, the forest changed.

 

Not silent this time‚Äîno, this was worse. The woods woke up. Birds shrieked from the canopy,

not in song but in alarm. Branches cracked overhead as squirrels bolted in panicked waves. The

underbrush writhed with smaller things fleeing, bodies darting past our boots as if we were no

safer than the trees.

 

The operatives froze. Hammers hung mid-swing.

 

Because when prey runs, it means the predator is moving.

 

Then the smell hit again. Musky.",1,1755878897.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1
The Fifth Avenue wedding venue glowed in the soft light of dawn as I adjusted the last orchid in a crystal vase. My fingers trembled slightly‚Äînot from exhaustion after the sleepless night of preparations, but from a giddy, almost desperate excitement. After five years of waiting, of promises made and broken, Nathan had finally agreed to marry me.
'Just a little higher on the left,' I whispered to myself, tilting my head to examine the arrangement. Perfect. Everything had to be perfect today.
The grand ballroom was transformed into the elegant, timeless space I'd envisioned since I was a little girl in Ohio dreaming of my future. Ivory silk draperies cascaded from ceiling to floor, catching the morning light that streamed through the tall windows. Crystal chandeliers sparkled above tables adorned with orchids and roses‚ÄîNathan's favorite. I'd chosen every detail with him in mind.
'Claire, honey?' My mother's voice echoed through the nearly empty ballroom. She stood in the doorway, already dressed in her powder-blue mother-of-the-bride outfit, her face a mixture of pride and concern. 'You need to start getting ready. The makeup artist is waiting.'
'Just one more minute,' I promised, adjusting a ribbon on a nearby chair. 'I want everything to be‚Äî'
'Perfect. I know.' Mom smiled, crossing the room to take my hands in hers. 'But the bride is what everyone will be looking at, not the flowers.'
I nodded, allowing her to lead me toward the bridal suite. My heart fluttered in my chest. This was compensation, I knew that. Nathan had only proposed after I'd given Sarah my business proposal‚Äîthe one I'd worked on for two years. But it was worth it. We were finally going to be husband and wife.
The bridal suite buzzed with activity. My cousins from Columbus, my aunt from Cincinnati, and my childhood best friend who'd flown in from Cleveland all crowded around, exclaiming over my dress hanging on the wall.
'Oh, Claire-bear!' Dad's voice cracked with emotion when he saw me. He'd aged in the last few years, his hair grayer than I remembered. 'You look just like your grandmother.'
As the makeup artist worked her magic, I closed my eyes, letting the chatter of my family wash over me. They'd traveled so far, spent so much money they didn't have to be here. For me. For this day.
'Has Nathan texted?' I asked my cousin Melissa, who was in charge of my phone.
'Not yet,' she said cheerfully. 'But you know men on their wedding day. Probably still figuring out his cufflinks.'
I nodded, ignoring the small knot forming in my stomach. Nathan was probably busy. Important surgeons had important things to do, even on their wedding day.
The hours ticked by. My hair was styled into an elegant updo, tiny diamonds woven through the strands. The dress‚Äîa fitted mermaid silhouette with delicate lace detailing‚Äîhugged my body perfectly. I looked like the bride I'd always wanted to be.
'It's almost time,' my mother whispered, fastening my grandmother's pearl necklace around my throat. Her eyes glistened with unshed tears. 'You're so beautiful.'
The ceremony was scheduled for 2:00 PM. At 1:45, there was still no word from Nathan.
'Call him,' I told Melissa, the knot in my stomach growing tighter.
'It goes straight to voicemail,' she reported after trying three times.
At 2:15, the wedding planner I'd hired to manage the day (so I could be a bride, not a coordinator) poked her head in. 'Claire? The guests are getting restless.'
'He's coming,' I insisted, my voice higher than normal. 'He's just... running late.'
At 2:30, my phone buzzed. My heart leaped‚Äîfinally!‚Äîbut Melissa's face fell as she looked at the screen.
'What is it?' I demanded, reaching for the phone.
'Claire, maybe you shouldn't‚Äî'
I snatched it from her hand. There on the screen was an Instagram notification: @SarahChenMD had posted a photo. With trembling fingers, I opened the app.
The image was simple: a positive pregnancy test, held in manicured fingers I recognized all too well. The caption read: 'The greatest gift @DrNathanPierce could ever give me. #BabyOnBoard #ForeverFamily'
The room spun around me. The phone slipped from my fingers, clattering to the floor as my knees gave way. I collapsed in a heap of white satin and lace, gasping for air that wouldn't come.
Distantly, I heard the commotion‚Äîmy mother's cry of alarm, my cousins' shocked whispers, the wedding planner's frantic questions. But all I could see was that plastic stick, that terrible caption, and the knowledge that crashed through me like a wrecking ball: Nathan was never coming.
The door burst open, and my father rushed in, his face ashen. 'Claire?' he knelt beside me, his weathered hands grasping mine. 'What's happened?'
I couldn't speak. I could only point to the phone on the floor, the screen still illuminated with the evidence of my complete humiliation. As Dad picked it up, his expression transformed from confusion to rage, then to a devastating pity that broke something fundamental inside me.
'Everyone's waiting,' I whispered, tears finally spilling down my carefully made-up face. 'Everyone's waiting for a wedding that's never going to happen.'

Chapter 2
Sunlight streamed through the hotel room curtains I hadn't bothered to close. My eyes burned from crying all night, my makeup smeared across the pristine white pillowcase like evidence of a crime. I reached for my phone before remembering I'd thrown it against the wall after the twentieth call from a reporter asking for a statement about being 'Manhattan's Most Humiliated Bride.'
I found it on the floor, screen miraculously intact. As I picked it up, notifications flooded in: missed calls from my parents, texts from distant relatives offering condolences, and worst of all, headlines. So many headlines.
'SOCIETY WEDDING DISASTER: SURGEON LEAVES PLANNER AT THE ALTAR'
'BABY DRAMA: DR. PIERCE CHOOSES COLLEAGUE OVER FIANC√âE'
'101 LETTERS, ZERO COMMITMENT: INSIDE NYC'S WEDDING SCANDAL'
My thumb hovered over Nathan's contact. Five years of my life, gone in an Instagram post. The memory of my father's face as he announced to two hundred guests that there would be no wedding today made me physically ill.
Instead of calling Nathan, I dialed Jessica.
'I was about to break down your door,' she answered immediately. 'Where are you?'
'The Langham,' I whispered, my voice raw. 'Room 1642.'
'I'll be there in thirty. And Claire?' Her voice softened. 'Bring those letters. All 101 of them.'
I hung up and looked at the vintage wooden box on the nightstand. Inside were Nathan's letters‚Äîapologies for missed anniversaries, for canceled vacations, for a thousand small betrayals I'd forgiven. Each one had seemed like proof he cared enough to make amends. Now they felt like exhibits in a case against my own judgment.
Jessica arrived with coffee and a determined expression that told me wallowing wasn't on the agenda.
'Drink this,' she commanded, handing me a venti cup. 'Then shower. You smell like champagne and despair.'
'I was supposed to be on a flight to Bali right now,' I said, voice cracking. 'Instead, I'm hiding in a hotel while my parents deal with returning wedding gifts.'
'And Nathan?' Jessica asked, her tone carefully neutral as she perched on the edge of the bed. 'Have you heard from him?'
I shook my head. 'Nothing. Not even a text.'
'That coward.' She took the wooden box from the nightstand, opening it to reveal the neatly stacked letters. 'Five years of pretty words, and he couldn't even face you.'
The shower helped clear my head, washing away the dried tears and the remnants of what should have been the happiest day of my life. When I emerged, Jessica had laid out fresh clothes‚Äîjeans and a sweater she must have brought from my apartment.
'I've been thinking,' she said, watching me dress. 'You deserve answers, Claire. Not from Instagram, not from Page Six. From him.'
'What's the point?' I asked, combing through my tangled hair. 'The pregnancy test made it pretty clear.'
'Did it?' Jessica raised an eyebrow. 'Because the Nathan I've watched manipulate you for years wouldn't just walk away. He'd have some elaborate explanation, some way to make you doubt what you saw with your own eyes.'
She was right. Nathan never simply ended things‚Äîhe twisted them, reframed them, until I questioned my own perception.
'So what do I do?' I asked, feeling a spark of something other than despair for the first time since yesterday. It might have been anger. It felt good.
'You go to his apartment,' Jessica said firmly. 'You look him in the eye. You demand the truth, not another beautifully handwritten letter of bullshit.'
I stared at her, then at the box of letters. Each one had been a bandage over a wound he'd inflicted, never allowing it to truly heal. I'd been collecting these elegant apologies like treasures, when they were really just pretty packaging for lies.
'You're right,' I said, standing up straighter. 'I need to hear him say it.'
Thirty minutes later, I stood outside Nathan's sleek Upper East Side apartment building, heart hammering in my chest. The doorman recognized me and let me up without calling‚ÄîI'd lived here part-time for years, after all.
I knocked, half-expecting no answer. But the door swung open almost immediately, revealing Nathan in perfectly pressed slacks and a cashmere sweater, looking for all the world like a man who hadn't just destroyed someone's life.
'Claire,' he said, his voice carefully modulated to convey surprise tinged with sympathy. 'I was going to call you today.'
'Were you?' I asked, stepping past him into the apartment we'd once talked about sharing after the wedding. 'Before or after your baby announcement made the society pages?'
He sighed, closing the door with a soft click that sounded like a trap snapping shut.
'That post,' he said, shaking his head ruefully, 'was a mistake. Sarah's mother is dying‚Äîterminal cancer. She's been desperate for a grandchild before she goes. The post was just... a white lie to give the poor woman some comfort in her final days.'
He delivered this explanation with such practiced sincerity that for one terrible moment, I felt myself wavering. This was what he did‚Äîmade the unforgivable sound reasonable, made me feel overly emotional for being upset.
'So you stood me up at my own wedding,' I said slowly, 'for a Instagram post?'
Nathan's eyes narrowed slightly, the only tell that my directness had irritated him. 'I think you're being a bit dramatic, Claire. It was a miscommunication. I was trying to handle a delicate situation with Sarah's family.'
As he spoke, I noticed something on the kitchen counter behind him‚Äîa woman's silk scarf I'd never seen before. And suddenly, I knew with absolute certainty that everything coming out of his mouth was a lie.",1,1755878797.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Also - as everyone knows (or should know) - reactions to any substance depend on the individual's unique biochemistry, so experiences may, and do, vary greatly.**

I have had a 20+ years aversion to sleep coupled with an actual (severe) circadian disorder. To make a very long story short: recently, I was ""recommended"" (by AI, no less) magnesium glycinate to help me ""relax"" (something that is also essential for my work, which is creative and at the same time intellectually very demanding) and fall asleep. I had read many posts about the very different reactions people had to MG, so was wary to try it, but I did anyway.

The first night, I took a 100 mg pill approximately two hours before sleep. I can't say it helped me RELAX - it was more like a heavy pall descending on my brain and behind my eyes, and it did not work alone (I took cca 7 mg of zolpidem - not even 10 mg works reliably lately), but it definitely helped me fall asleep AND stay asleep. I had very vivid dreams, but they were neutral, so, not a problem.  When I woke up, I felt physically fine, just craving even more sleep. (In my case, that's a good sign, because I am normally hyper-aware of everything from the moment I open my eyes, which is one of the factors that impede my sleep.)

Unfortunately, when I got up and started work, I felt something I can only describe as ""brain fog"" (I've heard the term a gazillion times, but never had it myself). There was a dull heaviness in my head - and, worst of all, a terrifying feeling that there is no SPACE for my thoughts to even move. My verbal recall and fluency plummeted. I took 100 mg of phosphatidylseritine (that usually works very fast and well for me), then, later, a capsule of lion's mane and two capsules of citicoline (I take all of these almost every day). Not only did I not feel their usual effect, but they seemed to be making the situation even worse. I took 100 mg of theanine with some coffee. Again, no effect (although I find theanine very mild anyway). The ""fog"" didn't clear that day at all.

That night I took the same dose, 100 mg, of MG, three hours before sleep. The next day, the effects were exactly as described above. The same applies for the third night and the following day - except I felt such anxiety (probably induced by various sources of mild stress AND the fact that I felt I was losing my cognitive abilities) that I had to take 0.25 of xanax, which dispelled it.

On the fourth night, I took 150 mg of MG, almost four hours before intended sleep onset. The next day, the heavy fog was still there, not showing any signs of abating. Only then it occurred to me to search for experiences of ""brain fog"" associated to MG intake... and, boy, there are a LOT of them.

Last night, I decided to forgo the MG and only took a sleeping pill. Today: ZERO fog, thoughts ""moving"", words flowing... it's as if clear skies returned after days of impenetrable fog and heavy rain.

I'm looking for someone. Someone who wants to possibly develop into a long term relationship. I'm easy going and love to be there for someone. I got out of a long term relationship a while ago and ready to go back in. I am a firm believer in wanting to take care of someone. I like to do small things as well (make sure you have a coffee before you wake, etc). I believe in doing all the boy-chores and making sure the person is taken care of and want someone who wants to do her part. In that regard this is who I'm looking for:

-Age doesn't matter as much as long as you're mature. 
-White/Asian/Hispanic 
-either skinny or in shape (wouldn't mind a gym girl).
-Down to Earth. 
-Fun.
-Wants to be devoted to someone and doesn't believe in sleeping around if they are talking to someone. 
-Id prefer NC locals but I'm not against getting to know someone somewhere else.

**1)**¬†**Flip the benefit into a tiny promise**  
When it‚Äôs bland: ‚ÄúHow to Save Money‚Äù  
Give it some punch: ‚ÄúSlash Your Bills ‚Äî Save $300 This Month (No Budgeting App)‚Äù  
Why it works: dramatic action specifics¬†(slash your bills)¬†+ a tiny promise¬†of potential (save $300)¬†= instant trust.  
  
**2) Add a timebox or deadline¬†with benefits**  
When it‚Äôs bland: ‚ÄúGet Fit Faster‚Äù  
Give it some punch: ‚ÄúGet Fit in 12 Minutes a Day ‚Äî Real, Repeatable‚Äù  
Why¬†it works: because people read in minutes ‚Äî so give ‚Äôem a finish line.

**3) Use an unexpected contrast**  
When it‚Äôs bland: ‚ÄúImprove Your Writing‚Äù  
Give it some punch: ‚ÄúWrite Less ‚Äî Say More: The Anti-Longform Trick‚Äù  
Why¬†it works: the brain perks up when two ideas collide.¬†Like when an immovable object meets an unstoppable force. You follow?

**4) Micro-story / scene**  
When it‚Äôs bland: ‚ÄúProductivity Tips‚Äù  
Give it some punch: ‚ÄúHow I Hit Inbox Zero Before Coffee ‚Äî 3 Weird Habits‚Äù

¬†

# Spring- March to May

¬†

The months from March to May are one of the most remarkable seasons for the trek. As this trek is at a relatively low altitude, the days are warmer from March to May, making it suitable for the trek.

Also, the days are sunny and clear making the views panoramic and wonderful. The vegetation is at its best with full bloom in spring. Highlighting the national flower of Nepal, Rhododendron at radiant color, this trek is best and suitable for all nature lovers.

¬†

# Monsoon ‚Äì June to August

¬†

Monsoon is always wonderful and most people out there enjoy traveling to Monsoon. There is something wonderful that we love about monsoon.

The vegetation looks clean and fresh with the stunning view of snow-capped mountains. Sometimes the mountains will disappear behind rain clouds, but that just makes it all the more special.

Temperatures are not so different from those of the springtime, perhaps a bit less cold at the higher points of this trek. The temperatures range from around 9 to 24 degrees celsius.

You might be lucky and have no rain at all but most common people can expect rain for short periods every day. Because of the rainfall, the trails will be more slippery.

If you want to trek in peace without much of a crowd then monsoon is the ideal season for you.  
Drinking hot tea inside your teahouse watching the rain falling outside can be just as magical an experience.

¬†

# Autumn-September to November

¬†

Autumn is one of the best seasons for the Poon Hill trek. Generally, autumn starts from September to October and is a season that attracts a lot of trekkers to Poon hill.

Besides, the clear weather during this season offers a panoramic view of the majestic Himalayas, as well as the natural landscapes. Besides, the clear blue Sky and the bearable temperature make this season the best among the trekkers.

Perhaps being the best time to trek the Himalayas, the trails to Poon hill will be busier.

Autumn is the main festival season in Nepal. Apart from the natural view, you can witness the culture and festivals in Nepal during Autumn.

The temperatures in Autumn are similar to spring, getting cooler as the season gets later. But expect in the region of 10 to 24 degrees celsius, with the temperature on Poon Hill itself dropping to freezing point.

¬†

# Winter- December to February

¬†

Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek is a low-altitude trek compared to other Himalayas treks. This trek can also be carried out during the winter.

The month from December to February is the winter months in Nepal where the temperature drops at the freezing point at a higher altitude. But temperatures at Ghorepani are bearable with warm clothing and extra preparations.

The temperatures drop to freezing in the mornings and evenings where the day temperatures will still be around 15 degrees Celsius which is very comfortable for hiking.

Overall the chances of rainfall during this month are probably low. however, there may be some light snow.

Again if you want to explore nature peacefully without a crowd then yes winter is ideal for you. As there will be fewer trekkers on the trail. Also, there will be no problem getting accommodation at teahouses.

Similarly, Mountain views will be stunning in the frosty air.

¬†

¬†

The trek to Poonhill is one of the most satisfying treks in Nepal both naturally and culturally. Throughout the journey to Poon hill, accommodation varies from luxurious to basic with lots of differences in between.

As the trek will start and end in Pokhara, the type of accommodation depends on your style and budget Pokhara as well. The higher you go up in the remote area, the more simple the accommodation will be.

Fortunately, there are nice rooms available in the majority of tea houses here in the Ghorepani trek. Most rooms have twin beds. However, only a few have attached bathrooms.

On average a twin room in a teahouse on the Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek will cost you $3-6 per night.  
On the other hand, you are expected to eat in the tea houses where you will be staying.

They‚Äôll generally ask you to order your food as you check-in. Furthermore, the tea houses here are charming, made from stone and wood, and a cozy place to relax at the end of a long day‚Äôs trekking.

# Foods in Poon Hill Trek

¬†

The meals after a day of hiking taste even better. Many trekking trails in Nepal offer typical Nepali food including the Poon Hill trek.

Similarly, you can find familiar food such as pasta, fried potatoes, and pancakes, and perhaps the less familiar such as Dal Bhat. Dal Bhat is the staple food of Nepal and you will come to love it.

1mxadqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mxadqh/does_the_krups_blooming_aroma_coffee_maker_truly/,Does the KRUPS Blooming Aroma Coffee Maker Truly Deliver in This Review?,"The KRUPS KM911AU0 Blooming Aroma Coffee Maker has been in my kitchen for a month now, and I‚Äôve brewed more cups of coffee than I can count. As someone who takes their morning brew seriously, this machine intrigued me with its promises of barista-quality coffee at home. The blooming function‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt come across often‚Äîwas particularly exciting. Having spent countless mornings testing out its features, I have plenty to share about this unique appliance.

**Design and Aesthetics**

The first thing that caught my eye about this coffee maker was its sleek stainless steel silver design. It looks modern and fits perfectly into my kitchen, which has a mix of professional and minimalist vibes. Measuring 12.68"" D x 6.3"" W x 13.66"" H, it slips onto my counter without monopolizing space. The layout is thoughtfully designed, with intuitive buttons and no unnecessary complexity. It has a sturdy feel, weighing in at 6.37 pounds, and I found all the components like the carafe and filter to be well-made, which makes it less likely to break during everyday use.

**Functionality and Features**

This is where the KRUPS KM911AU0 becomes a game-changer. It boasts a blooming function, which pre-soaks the ground coffee to release carbon dioxide before brewing. This allows for better flavor extraction, and honestly, I noticed the difference. My coffee has a more profound and nuanced flavor profile that just wasn‚Äôt there when I used my old drip coffee maker. The five-hole shower head plays a big role here, ensuring an even saturation of coffee grounds. Every sip feels rich, with natural sweetness coming through effortlessly.

**Check KRUPS KM911AU0 price on Amazon.** [Check KRUPS KM911AU0 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dv7ctd6c/)  

**Ease of Use**

Mornings are chaotic, and this coffee machine has been a lifesaver. The fully automatic operation means I simply load it up with water and my ground coffee, press a button, and let it work its magic. Options like enhancing sweetness or a half-drip function make it customizable to your preference. For households where each person drinks coffee differently, having these options is incredible. Even the keep-warm function adjusts to the batch size, which was handy when I brewed six cups to last my spouse and me an entire lazy Saturday morning.

**Advantages**

Here‚Äôs why this coffee maker stands out:

- Exceptional flavor courtesy of the blooming and five-hole showerhead features.  
- SCA certification (Specialty Coffee Association), which reassures me about its precise brewing standards.  
- Easy-to-clean components, all of which are dishwasher-safe.  
- Aroma tube technology that preserves the coffee‚Äôs heat and channels its aroma into each pour.

**Critiques**

Despite all these positives, no product is without its flaws. This coffee maker does have some areas worth noting:

- The reusable filter doesn‚Äôt capture fine coffee grounds perfectly, so I get occasional sediment in my cup.  
- It‚Äôs slightly louder than other drip coffee machines I‚Äôve owned.  
- The brewing time, while not excessive, feels longer compared to simpler machines.  

**Competing Brands**

Of course, the market is flooded with coffee machines making grand promises. Comparing this to something like the Breville Precision Brewer, the KRUPS KM911AU0 holds its ground with a user-friendly interface and superior blooming process. The Breville‚Äôs advantage, however, lies in its customizable brew settings‚Äîideal for coffee aficionados who want to experiment. On the other hand, budget-friendly models like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup don‚Äôt offer the blooming function or the same level of rich flavor extraction, making the KRUPS brew worth the upgrade for daily drinkers.

**True Value**

Is it worth it? I think it depends on how much you care about your coffee. For a casual coffee maker, it might be overkill. But if you want something that can genuinely elevate your at-home coffee experience without complex operations or barista skills, it‚Äôs a worthy investment. Plus, knowing that it‚Äôs SCA-certified gives me peace of mind about its quality. Even though it‚Äôs not a budget model, the mix of aesthetics, functionality, and taste makes it feel appropriately priced for its features.

For those of you unfamiliar with this slang term hall pass, here‚Äôs what it is. A hall pass is used to refer to an agreement between a couple that they can have sex outside of their relationship, generally on a temporary basis or one time basis. Hall passes are given for famous people. Hall pass is officially a term used by schools to allow students to be outside of class during class time. 

Here goes a tangent:

Fun fact: There‚Äôs an episode of Friends (Season 3, ep 5 just so you know) where Ross makes a hall pass list which includes Isabella Rossellini (good choice Ross). Chandler says the list probably shouldn‚Äôt include international celebrities since it would be unlikely that he would meet them in the US, so Ross takes her off his list. Ross laminates the list for some reason üòÇ. Lo and behold, into the coffee shop walks Isabella Rossellini herself! Rachel gives Ross the go ahead to hit on her. Ross tries flirting with Isabella by claiming she is on his hall pass list. Unfortunately for Ross, Isabella spots the laminated list and finds out that she is not on it. Ross explains that she was on it but he bumped her off it for Wynona Ryder because of the international thing. That didn‚Äôt work. Isabella walks out of the coffee shop in a huff. 

Just so you know, Ross‚Äôs final list included Uma Thurman, Michelle Pfeiffer, Winona Ryder, Dorothy Hamill (of the irresistible haircut!) and Elizabeth Hurley (who is also international so wtf! üòÇ).

1mxacfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/drhrclark/comments/1mxacfj/diabetes_and_its_causes/,Diabetes and its causes,"Diabetes is chronically high blood sugar due to insufficient insulin or cellular resistance to insulin. Dr. Clark observed that the pancreas could regenerate insulin function, but only once its toxic and parasitic burdens were removed.

Dr. Hulda Clark found that diabetes is the direct result of pancreatic damage caused by parasites, toxins, and pollutants. Central to this condition is *Eurytrema pancreaticum*, the pancreatic fluke of cattle, that settles in the pancreas and destroys insulin-producing islets. It requires the presence of wood alcohol (methanol) to thrive.

**Root causes of diabetes**

* **Pancreatic fluke (*****Eurytrema pancreaticum*****)** Found in all diabetes cases. It enters the body from raw or undercooked meat and dairy or vegetables contaminated with fluke eggs.
* **Wood alcohol (methanol)** Enables the parasite to survive in the pancreas. Found in:
   * Bottled drinks, soda, baby formula, powdered beverages
   * Artificial sweeteners and decaffeinated products
   * Polluted medications and insulin
* **HA wart virus**Common in diabetic pancreases. It disappears when the fluke is removed.
* **Additional pathogens** Co-infections from *Staph aureus*, *Shigella*, flu virus, mumps virus, mycoplasma, and others often invade a fluke-infected pancreas.
* **Mold toxins**
   * **Kojic acid** from gray-spotted potatoes and certain coffees
   * **Aflatoxins** from contaminated grains
* **Heavy metals** Gold, cadmium, thulium, and palladium all accumulate in the pancreas and block function.
* **Food-based toxins**
   * **Phloridzin** from unripe apples, pork, soy, and grains
   * **Gallic acid** is used in processed oils and preserved foods

**Symptoms of diabetes**

Symptoms of diabetes may include high fasting blood sugar, excessive thirst, and frequent urination. Many individuals also experience fatigue, low energy levels, and poor wound healing. Blurred vision is common due to methanol accumulation in the eyes. Additional signs can include nerve pain, leg cramps, discomfort in the feet,¬† digestive disturbances or soreness in the lower abdomen or testicles.

**How to treat and reverse diabetes naturally**

Dr. Clark‚Äôs therapy focuses on eliminating the root causes of pancreatic destruction. This allows the insulin-producing cells to recover and the blood sugar to normalize, often within weeks.

**Step-by-step treatment**

# 1. Kill the pancreatic fluke and co-infections

* Use a **zapper** targeting *Eurytrema* at 420.35‚Äì422.3 kHz
* Take the **herbal parasite cleanse** (black walnut hull, wormwood, cloves)
* Stay on **maintenance parasite program** to avoid reinfection

# 2. Eliminate methanol (wood alcohol)

* Stop all **canned, bottled, powdered, or decaffeinated** food and drinks
* Avoid **artificial sweeteners** completely
* Test **insulin and medications** for methanol using Syncrometer
* Use only **pure brands** of insulin if still needed

1mxabw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1mxabw2/explore_the_best_coffee_brewer_technivorm/,Explore the Best Coffee Brewer Technivorm Moccamaster Worth It,"Testing out the Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 was an experience that left me with mixed feelings‚Äînot in a bad way, just a blend of admiration and a cautious note of its quirks. Coffee is my lifeline, and this coffee maker aimed to elevate my caffeine routine. Handmade in the Netherlands, the product's polished silver design immediately brought a modern charm to my kitchen counter. It felt like owning a piece of art in coffee engineering. The minimalistic yet sophisticated design gave me a sense of reliability.

**Build & Design Quality**

The first thing I noticed was the solid build. We‚Äôre talking about stainless steel here, folks‚Äîthis machine is built to last. I liked how every component, from the reusable filter to the thermal carafe, had a sturdy and durable feel. It's not just another gadget you'd replace in a year. While setting it up, the compact design (6.75"" D x 11.5"" W x 15.25"" H) fit perfectly between my toaster and blender without taking up too much space. The polished silver finish added that modern touch which I often miss in other coffee makers. I found the country of origin‚ÄîNetherlands‚Äîmentioned prominently, and that alone assured me of its quality craftsmanship.

**Ease of Use**

Operating this coffee maker is simple. The button-based interface was intuitive enough for my first try, no need for flipping through the entire owner's manual (though I skimmed it). The one-button operation to brew a full pot in about 6 minutes makes it perfect for mornings when I'm barely functioning and can‚Äôt be bothered with anything complicated. The manual-adjust brew basket is a feature I found intriguing. It allowed me to tweak how fast the coffee flowed into the carafe, which felt like a subtle nod to customization.

[See Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 deals on Amazon now.](https://windtoons.com/p/b002s4di2s/)

**Performance & Brewing Experience**

The brewing process is something to admire‚Äîa pre-immersion drip-style system, ensuring the coffee blooms perfectly, thanks to its ultra-precise pulse action. That's tech-speak for, ""Coffee smells amazing while being brewed."" Within the first week, I tested different grind sizes and coffee beans to see how it fared. Adjusting the grind size was vital to getting the perfect brew, as warned in the manual. While it handled medium to coarse grounds like a champ, fine grinds were a little messy and challenged the drip basket. The resulting coffee was smooth, flavorful, and exceptionally hot.

**Thermal Carafe Benefits**

The stainless steel thermal carafe is where this coffee maker shines. I brewed a large pot one busy morning, and even after an hour, the coffee was still warm enough to drink without reheating. The included travel lid for the carafe is a thoughtful addition. I didn‚Äôt use it for traveling yet, but I tested it with a long meeting day at my desk, and it kept the coffee warm almost all morning. However, I wish the carafe had better ergonomics for pouring‚Äîit‚Äôs not clunky, but it‚Äôs not the smoothest either.

**Boons**

- Eye-catching polished silver finish with a sturdy build  
- Intuitive one-button operation saves loads of time  
- Customizable brew basket enhances personal brewing preferences  
- Pre-immersion pulse system blooming method for consistent flavor extraction  

**Areas of Concern**

- Not ideal for fine coffee grinds‚Äîclogs the system sometimes  
- Thermal carafe‚Äôs pouring design could use ergonomic improvements  
- Missing advanced features I‚Äôm accustomed to, like timers or apps  

**Competing Products**

Comparing it with similar high-end coffee makers like the Breville Precision Brewer or the Bonavita Connoisseur, the Moccamaster feels a little old-school. Both Breville and Bonavita offer programmable settings and multiple brewing styles, which could appeal to those like my tech-loving coworker. The Moccamaster may lack those bells and whistles, but it wins in durability and craftsmanship‚Äîtwo areas the other brands can‚Äôt beat easily. Also, this coffee maker doesn‚Äôt require disposable filters, saving me additional costs in the long run.

**Bang for the Buck**

Is it worth it? Well, you‚Äôre paying for longevity, craftsmanship, and superb coffee quality. Unlike basic coffee machines, this one feels like a long-term investment. It doesn‚Äôt scream ""budget-friendly,"" but it‚Äôs definitely aimed at serious coffee aficionados who want consistency and precision in every cup. Over time, I believe the reusable components and sturdy materials will make up for the cost when compared to buying cheaper machines frequently.

1mxabmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mxabmo/despair_is_quiet/,Despair is quiet,"It's a typical day for me, nothing out of the ordinary. 

My husband gets up first to get ready for his office job. It's a slacks-and-button up kind of place. How can I forget? I inherited the responsibility for making sure those slacks and shirts are laundered when he resumed working out of the home. 

I get up and go sit on the couch while he showers. I know I'm probably not going to get the opportunity to shower myself that day; the water heater in our old house can't accommodate two baths within the same two hour span. Our daughter won't sleep another two hours, my workday won't hold, and getting up to shower after my daughter's ritual 4am waking is a prospect too depressingly utilitarian for me to consider yet. I'm sure I'll get there with time. Plus if I'm being honest, I value the quiet and unproductive time of sitting alone in the silence. I don't get a lot of that anymore. 

As his shower wraps up, I start to move around the house and take inventory. There's a scattering of trash and condiment bottles across the living room ottoman and a half-empty glass of water on the end table, all within easy reach for our daughter. I clean it all up before she gets up for the day; he doesn't notice that his trash all magically disappeared. I see the dirty dishes from the dinner I cooked the night before stacked on the kitchen counter and in the sink - mostly. Some of it sits on the stovetop, right where I served it, and still full of food. I didn't have time to clean the kitchen again while I was giving my daughter a bath and performing her bed routine. Once she was down, it wasn't worth the noise. I knew I'd do it today, anyway. There's his socks thrown on the floor next to the couch. The rest of his discarded clothes from the day before are on the bedroom floor. Those I leave for now to see if he'll pick them up and put them in the hamper. He doesn't. He leaves for work with what is technically a kiss. 

My daughter wakes up 15 or so minutes later. Some days I'd be rushing to get her fed and dressed for daycare, but not today. Today she once again has one of the communicable child illnesses that keep kids out of daycare, but paradoxically seem to come exclusively from daycares. That seems more the norm than the exception these days. It's a foregone conclusion, absent any discussion, that I will once again figure out how to balance working my job and being a stay-at-home mother. I do work from home, after all. Sometimes even I forget that my on-paper, pays-the-bills job is the high-pressure, high-earning one in the house. It seems to be the one that's always expected to yield and take the backseat. 

And while my job had been remarkably understanding, I absolutely can't take more PTO for this. So far nobody knows that I'm a month behind on my documentation in some places, and I need to fix it before anyone becomes aware. This is a first for me. I've always been professionally excellent, now I'm barely professional-passing. Reputations are hard to build and so easy to lose; the weight of watching mine slip away in a speedrun makes my chest constrict and forces all the air out of my lungs again. My career isn't  perfect, but it's mine and I worked *so* hard for it. I can't lose it as a person, and we can't afford for me to lose it as a family. I have to find more to give, I *have* to do better than this.

I move my laptop out of my office and into the living room where I can keep watch from my perch and work at the same time. It's silly to be upset by such a little change, but it feels symbolic. I'm foregoing the private space in the house that's just mine, decorated my way, removed from all the other obligations, so that I can be even more ""present"" for my family. By 10am, I'm getting a headache from trying to focus on my emails and trackers while the same button of a musical children's toy gets pressed 4 feet behind me over and over. My calendar signals that I have a business strategy meeting starting soon, and I mentally prepare myself to turn off my sweet, high-pitched ""mom voice"" and switch into my role as a department director. I'll be switching in and out of personas, back and forth, for the next hour. Switching ""alters"" like a TikToker in an intro to psychology class will not help the headache situation. And all the while is the crying. Crying to be held, crying to be put back down, crying for food, crying that I would dare put food in front of her. And I *have* to get through this meeting, so I break. I give her some nutritionally void snacks and turn on Sesame Street. Her hypnotized stare at the TV brings me more shame than it does relief. Tack on being ""that kind"" of mom to my list of failures today. 

When she finally eats something of substance and goes down for her nap, I sit back down at my makeshift desk. I pull up the first of many Excel sheets I'm going to need to update, and I just stare at it. My brain is screaming at my hands to move, but instead my feet take over and wander me to the coffee maker. I pour another cup, telling myself reflexively that my daily chest pains aren't that bad and I need the energy. I wander back to my desk, sit down again, and realize I'm sobbing. I don't know what to do with that, so I wander again. This time I find myself in front of a mirror, and I just stare at the woman there. Her eyes are so tired, so devoid of the fire and life they used to hold. And past the frantic, unexplainable tears is the pity. The woman in the mirror looks so *sad* for me, so sorry for what my life looks like. And I'm ashamed of how much I want her pity. The tears change now, and sympathy turns to a sense of embarrassment that radiates out of my bones until it fills every space inside of me. I leave the woman in the mirror behind, suddenly finding her intolerable to look at. She used to be gorgeous. 

The afternoon passes in its manic blur. There are beds to be made, laundry to be laundered, dishes to be done, a bathroom to be scrubbed (my husband's refusal to flush makes frequent cleaning a necessity for what remains of my mental health). There's dinner to be cooked, pets to be cared for, and appointments/logistics to be managed all while the work day marches on in the background. Repeatedly, I'm turned to as if I were the same smart, condident, fearless leader I used to be instead of an obscene caricature of her. I perform my best impersonation of who they still expect me be in between domestic tasks and the never-ending care and attention that my daughter deserves. 

The work pressures go into hibernation for the day just in time for the ""second shift"" known to so many women to begin. It nevers feels like it actually ended, anyway. Feed my daughter dinner, prep dinner for my husband and myself, take the dogs for their walk, and start cooking the dinner. My husband gets home from work in time to spend 15-30 minutes with our daughter before it's time for me to give her a bath. Outside of two instances where I've been injured, he doesn't offer to take over bath and bed duty. I don't get the impression it would ever occur to him to ask for it as if the time with her were a privilege or a joy. He's a running soundtrack of huffing and sighs whenever he's imposed upon to lift a finger in the home or with his child. He's convinced himself that it's a perfectly fine way to behave, because ""he didn't say anything."" He refuses to recognize or take accountability for the adolescent sulkiness or the cloud it casts around the home, and I'm too tired to keep beating my head against that rock when it doesn't want to move. I do it all myself without asking because I don't want my daughter to feel the rejection of a parent who would rather be anywhere else but with her, anyway.  

Some nights he goes out to drink with his friends. The unfairness of the differential free time used to bother me; now I'm just grateful for the extra quiet time between when my daughter goes to bed and when he comes back. I hope on those nights that he'll come home in a good mood and grateful for the opportunity to go out while I stayed home to give him that opportunity. That's seldom the case. Usually he comes back in some level of upset that the friends he chooses to surround himself with talked about their own problems or ongoings the whole time. He often laments how everyone over-relies on him to carry their emotional weight, and I'll generally need to hear about half an hour to 45 minutes of that lamentation. Anything less triggers a *very* powerful meltdown about how his emotions aren't valued and he never gets to express his feelings. 

Sometimes he asks me what's wrong, if I'm okay. Sometimes the placid surface cracks and the ripcurrent can be seen, I guess. In those moments, I swallow the bitter disappointment of self-betrayal and say everything is fine. I'm fine.  It doesn't matter anyway, and I don't care enough to defend my right to be broken in a court of law judged and tried by him. Despair is quiet. ",1,1755878140.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Sorry for the long post.

I (F27) never thought I‚Äôd be writing something like this, but an old chapter of my life has suddenly opened again, and I‚Äôm not sure how to handle it.

Back in 11th and 12th grade, I had a best friend who I thought was my soul sister. We were inseparable. After school, I moved to another city for graduation, and even though we weren‚Äôt together physically, she would write me long messages saying how much she missed me and how she couldn‚Äôt find another bestie like me. I really valued that bond.

At the same time, I had a boyfriend who later turned out to be toxic and emotionally abusive. My best friend never liked him and kept saying I could do better. She also tried to set me up with her own friend, which I always refused because back then, I was deeply in love with my boyfriend. At first, her concern felt like something a true friend would do, but over time it became obsessive. She would keep repeating how much harm he was doing to me, and our fights increased because of this.

Then came the most painful moment of my life‚ÄîI lost my dad. I was extremely close to him, and his passing broke me completely. Both my boyfriend and my best friend were there for the funeral. They saw how devastated I was. But instead of supporting me, both of them ended up making my pain so much worse.

Within two weeks of my dad‚Äôs passing, my boyfriend‚Äôs possessiveness became unbearable. He acted like he suddenly had full control over me, doubted me constantly, and even fought with one of my male friends so badly that it escalated to the police station. The stress on top of my grief was too much. That‚Äôs when I decided to break up with him.

Around that same time, I met an old friend for just a coffee, to talk and feel normal for a while. That one meeting gave me a little breathing space. But after this, things turned ugly. My best friend suddenly distanced herself from me because I never agreed to date her friend. On top of that, someone planted the idea in my ex‚Äôs head that I broke up with him because I was cheating with this old friend I had coffee with. And guess who planted that idea? My best friend.

Yes‚Äîthe same person who always said she hated him. Suddenly, she was on his side. They started talking, and together they decided that I was not just a bad girlfriend but also a bad friend. Then one night, they both showed up at my house and confronted me, throwing horrible accusations at me. They said I was dishonest, disloyal, and a fake. I was frozen and in shock, just crying as they attacked me with words. This was only weeks after losing my dad. My mom and another friend had to intervene, send them home, and protect me. That was the last night I ever spoke to either of them.

After that, I cut ties completely‚Äînot just with her but also with mutual friends who continued to associate with her. A year later, I met the man who is now my husband. He knew about her too and even told me she used to speak badly about me and my family after our friendship ended. But he never cared about her words, and eventually we got married. My life since then has been happy and peaceful.

Until recently.

She got married too, and by coincidence, she now lives in the same town as me. A few weeks ago, I ran into her at the mall. To my shock, she acted as if absolutely nothing had ever happened. She even told me she has ‚Äúforgiven me‚Äù (her exact words) and said she wants to start fresh as friends again. I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe her audacity. Forgiven me? After everything she put me through‚Äîespecially during the time I had just lost my dad‚Äîshe thinks she‚Äôs the one who needed to forgive?

Since then, she‚Äôs been trying to reach out. She‚Äôs been calling and messaging me, even trying to make plans to meet up. I‚Äôve been ignoring her and canceling every time, but she doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that I don‚Äôt want this. My husband is furious about it and completely supports me in not reconnecting. I also have no interest in rebuilding anything with her.

So here‚Äôs where I need advice (I am a big people pleaser and has major problem of not being able to say NO): how do I make her understand that I don‚Äôt want her back in my life? Should I keep ignoring her until she gets the message, or should I be upfront and tell her directly that I don‚Äôt want to restart this friendship?

Thank you for reading this long post. I just don‚Äôt want to reopen wounds that took me years to heal.",1,1755878116.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False
1mxa9fr,https://i.redd.it/x1z8wi3selkf1.jpeg,From clogged shower drain to zero hair fall in 6 months. I skipped Minoxidil and went holistic. *LAST POST GOT REMOVED*,"Last post got auto removed, so will try it once again. @mod do not remove without contacting me, if removed again, this mod is getting payed by big pharma?! Please screenshot! 

I am 29 and my hair was falling out so badly that every shower ended with a drain full of hair. I was ready to start Minoxidil because I felt desperate. Instead, I decided to try something different and went to a dietitian.

My diet was really poor. Too much coffee and convenience food, not nearly enough nutrients. The dietitian explained that deficiencies were probably making things worse and gave me a food plan that focused on iron with vitamin C for absorption, B vitamins for keratin support, vitamin D and omega 3 for scalp health, and vitamin E with zinc for follicle protection.

I also started taking Vitamin D3. I used to take Doctor‚Äôs Best, and than Sport Research because it had same day delivery Amazon. Honestly, any good brand will do. On top of that, I used the Mudmasky Vitamin Scalp Serum. I do not like the nozzle because it is hard to apply, but the formula itself is amazing. It is lightweight, not greasy, and my scalp feels nourished immediately after using it and helped my roots get stronger. Also via Amazon, got the monthly subscription with discount.

Fast forward 6 months and my shower drain is basically empty. I hardly see a single hair now. My hair feels stronger, shinier, and I no longer panic every time I wash it.

I know everyone is different, but for me fixing my nutrition and supporting my scalp directly was a total game changer. Sometimes the solution is not a prescription, it is what you put on your plate and how you take care of your scalp.

Let me know if you have questions!

About a month ago, I started the process of ADHD diagnosis. 

I've wondered and often thought I had it, but chose to keep rawdoggin' life without diagnosis or medication until recently. Life hit a point to where it was truly too overwhelming, so I sought help.

I was placed on Strattera. It has been life-changing in a way I never thought possible.

My mind has always felt like a highway of traffic, running at full speed, full and clear thoughts constantly bombarding me at the same time. 

Like... controlled chaos. I could make out all of the thoughts, capable of execution of some ideas and needs, then crippled by the most simple tasks; send a quick text to someone for work.

So, for the first time in my entire life, I understand what a quiet mind truly is. I've never felt that before. 

Today I just sat in my chair after coffee in silence. My mind was silent. One thought at a time and controlled processing.

This is what normal people can do? I see why it's so easy to do things on a whim and handle tasks now.

Before, it was as if I felt the pressure in the present of everything I needed to do, and the anxiety of running out of time and not achieving what I needed to do, all at once. Nor could I organize to handle and schedule tasks.

Now? I can quickly shift, organize, and balance my energy, mental load, and distribute tasks through the day and week easily.

Sometimes I want to cry tears of joy over the quietness of my mind. In my near 39 years of living, I finally understand mental rest.",1,1755877782.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

1mxa0xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mxa0xb/does_the_presto_2822_coffee_percolator_deliver/,Does the Presto 2822 Coffee Percolator Deliver the Best Brew for Its Price Review?,"**A Daily Experience with the Presto 02822 6-Cup Stainless-Steel Coffee Percolator**  

Testing the Presto 02822 6-Cup Stainless-Steel Coffee Percolator in my kitchen felt like welcoming a retro icon into my routine. I was intrigued the moment I slid it out of its frustration-free packaging. The classic stainless-steel finish and compact design made it a perfect addition to my countertop‚Äîboth functional and aesthetic. Measuring about 7.5 inches wide and 10 inches tall, it slots snugly without hogging precious space. Its construction oozes durability, and to my surprise, it feels much lighter than it looks at just 2.65 pounds.  

Brewing a quick cup in the morning? No problem. This is a manual coffee percolator, so if you enjoy coffee-making rituals, this appliance delivers a satisfying hands-on experience. Plug it into its 120-volt outlet, and within minutes (thanks to its efficient 500-watt heating capability), the familiar bubbling sound signals that rich, aromatic coffee is ready.  

**Pluses**  
- Brews from 2 to 6 cups, perfect for solo sips or a shared pot.  
- The retro charm of that percolating sound‚Äîit‚Äôs unbeatable!  
- Stainless steel build ensures robustness and enhances heat retention.  
- A drip-free spout makes serving incredibly graceful, even during hectic mornings.  

[Find the best price for Presto 02822 on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b002lvuik8/)  

**Ease of Use: A Practical Brewing Companion**  
Operating this coffee percolator is simplicity itself. The detachable cord prevents tangles and makes it easy to move around the kitchen, while the stay-cool bottom ensures safe placement. The cool-touch handle and knob let me pour without the faintest hesitation of scalding myself‚Äîa thoughtful touch for those early caffeinated sprints out the door. Combined with the automatic keep-warm mode, this machine understands that some mornings are slower than others, and second cups should stay hot.  

In my tests, I found the reusable filter to be a smart addition. There's no worry about running out of paper filters, which is both cost-effective and eco-conscious. However, cleaning up manually, while not difficult, is slightly more time-intensive compared to my modern drip coffee maker.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Larger gatherings may outpace its 6-cup capacity.  
- A manual mode means no programming options for folks who like their coffee brewing automated.  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
The star of the show is the coffee this percolator produces. Rich, wholesome, and piping hot. It retains that robust flavor profile you‚Äôd typically expect from percolators, yet it doesn‚Äôt taste over-extracted, provided you get the grind size right. I let my coworkers weigh in during a coffee break, and they appreciated the nostalgic experience of coffee prepared this way‚Äîit felt distinctly bold in flavor. If you like lighter brews, this might feel too strong, as percolators lean heavy on extraction.  

**How It Compares to Others**  
Against competitors like the Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Percolator, it trades quantity for portability and sleekness. While the Hamilton boasts a larger capacity, I‚Äôve noticed its bulkiness can be inconvenient for small spaces. The Presto's drip-free spout, meanwhile, is unbeatable‚Äîno coffee stains here! It also edges out the Farberware 8-Cup Coffee Percolator on handling safety, thanks to its cool-touch knob and handle, although Farberware does provide slightly faster brewing.  

**Budget-Friendly and Worth It?**  
Stacked against these features, the Presto 02822 is impressively cost-effective. It's an option that doesn‚Äôt break the bank yet feels like you‚Äôre investing in a little morning luxury. It‚Äôs not smartphone-connected nor laden with bells and whistles, but for a manual device, it checks most boxes. If you‚Äôre seeking something classic and durable, this offers an excellent price-performance ratio without the headaches of overly complicated setups.

1mxa0od,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mxa0od/explore_cabiclean_water_filter_replacement_review/,Explore Cabiclean Water Filter Replacement Review Is It Worth Your Faucet Upgrade,"The Cabiclean PSTTU-1213 Water Filter Replacement is a product I've grown to appreciate after extensively using it in my household. It‚Äôs compatible with PUR and PUR PLUS faucet filtration systems, making it a versatile choice for many kitchen setups. What initially drew me in was the promise of high-efficiency filtration through natural coconut activated carbon, reducing contaminants like chlorine, heavy metals, and odors simply and effectively. But of course, no product is without its nuances, and this filter has given me plenty to think about.

**Design and Compatibility**  
Its compact design, measuring 3 x 9.5 x 7 inches, fits snugly into faucet filtration systems without any awkward protrusions. The six-pack option translates to up to 18 months of clean water, assuming you replace one every three months as recommended. I installed it into my PUR Classic faucet mount, and the fit was seamless. There's no extra fuss involved in setting it up either‚Äîsoaking the filter for three minutes beforehand was quick and straightforward. 

[Check Cabiclean PSTTU-1213 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0dqcvz2zf/)

**Key Positives**  
What stood out most was its ability to deliver on its filtration promise. This water filter is NSF-certified, which instantly gave me peace of mind. After using it, I noticed the water tasted much better‚Äîalmost as if it had been bottled at a spring in comparison to how it tasted fresh out of the faucet before.  
- Effectively filters lead, chlorine, and odors.  
- Easy installation and compatibility across multiple PUR systems.  
- Cost-effective as a six-pack provides water for over a year.  

**Filtration Efficiency**  
This isn‚Äôt just any filter pretending to be effective‚ÄîCabiclean means business. I‚Äôve used it in a household that goes through a lot of water thanks to pets and coffee brewing! The natural coconut activated carbon works well, removing over 99% of residual chlorine, plus organic particles. It's fantastic to deliver crystal-clear water, especially since our area is notorious for having slightly funky tap water. My younger brother even commented on the difference while scowling at the thought of drinking anything unfiltered after this.

**Durability and Maintenance**  
As far as durability goes, each filter is built to last approximately three months under normal use. I'm three months into my second cartridge, and it feels as effective as the first. Still, I did notice you must soak it properly before first use to prevent any bubbles or incomplete filtration. Forget that, and you might end up with water spitting out oddly from the faucet for a few days.

**Downsides to Keep in Mind**  
While there‚Äôs a lot to love, the product isn‚Äôt without limitations. My first challenge came with soaking‚Äîit‚Äôs not intuitive unless you read the directions closely. If someone skips that, the filter may not perform optimally at the start. Additionally, the coconut carbon leaves some sediment in the first few runs, which clears up quickly but feels inconvenient initially.  
- Requires pre-soaking before use or issues may arise.  
- Small initial sediment leakage while breaking it in.  
- It‚Äôs significantly dependent on proper faucet alignment for efficiency.  

**Comparison with Competitive Options**  
There are several competitors in this space, such as the original PUR RF-9999 filters, which honestly work just as well but come at a higher price point per unit. Brita faucet filters are another option, but while they focus on taste, they don't seem as adept at dealing with all contaminants like lead. With Cabiclean's product, I‚Äôm paying less and not compromising much on performance, making it a balanced middle-ground choice for budget-conscious yet quality-focused users.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering its superior performance and the six-pack offering, these replacement filters offer affordable quality. Comparable brands often come in smaller packs or single units, meaning you‚Äôll spend more over time. While Cabiclean might not have the same brand recognition as its competitors, the quality matches up impressively. Spending less for the same NSF-certified safety and filtration efficiency? That‚Äôs a win in my book.

1mxa05h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/1mxa05h/could_this_be_an_episode_or_just_obsession/,Could this be an episode or just obsession?,"
My ex and I broke up about two months ago. Since then, he has shown up at my gym multiple times (approximately three separate occasions) and waited outside for me. Each time, he asked me to take him back and suggested things like going to church together or attending couples therapy. I consistently told him no. Whenever I rejected him, I noticed he became angry and physically tense ‚Äî his nose and face would twitch, and his demeanor would become aggressive. He also could not keep his hands to himself, like trying to hug me, kiss me, and just touching my arms, legs. 

On one of these occasions, he reached toward my shirt by my chest area as if to grab me in an attempt to stop me from leaving. While he did not make full contact, his intent was clear. Nearly every time he confronted me, he also took my phone from me by force. He would sometimes return it temporarily only to take it again, and eventually I would get it back after persuading him to leave. He‚Äôs also cried on like every interaction telling him to give him another chance. I broke up with him because he threw a coffee table when angry, and calling me names and yelling at me, which I did not want to deal with. Then later found out he cheated on me 2x that I know of, another time he asked for a girls socials at the mall (different girl then the one he cheated with) he supposedly came clean to me and told me this bc he wanted to start over, even tho he lied initially about the girl he asked for her socials, he had said he accidentally added her on snap. 

During our relationship (which lasted about seven months), I had seen only limited signs of this type of behavior. He is unmedicated, and I recall one instance of rage where he threw a coffee table, as well as another occasion where he became angry about losing his job and made disturbing comments ‚Äî such as saying he wanted to put people in concentration camps. He would later dismiss such remarks by saying he did not mean them and only said things like that when angry.

I have blocked him on all social media and on his phone number. Despite this, he continues to call me using ‚ÄúNo Caller ID‚Äù and has left both voicemails demanding that I answer and silent voicemails. I have not responded to him. For several weeks, I even changed my gym schedule and location within the same branch system to avoid him. After not seeing him for a while, I believed he had stopped showing up. Unfortunately, this was not the case.

The other day I was leaving the gym when I saw my ex waiting outside for me again. He blocked me from leaving (he stands in front of my door and will not move or let me in) and forcibly took my phone. He told me he would not give it back unless I agreed to take him back. We were there for about 20 mins, him crying and saying how his life was and that he was changing, his eyes were very dilated and one was droopy, makes me think he was on something. He did same as before; not keeping his hands to himself and being kinda aggressive so at that point, my sister contacted my father for help.

When my father arrived, he told my ex to leave me and my family alone. My ex pretended to leave but then turned back, making gun hand signs, calling my father the N-word, and acting aggressively.

I got into my car to leave the area. My ex jumped onto the hood of my car and said to stop playing with him, before moving aside after my dad told him to get off. As I began reversing, he ran in front of my vehicle and continuously kicked my bumper. I was able to drive away from the parking lot.

I did not initially realize my ex was following me, but as I stopped at a red light, he struck the back of my car twice with his vehicle. I then saw him reverse as if preparing to hit me again. Fearing for my safety, I ran the red light and sped forward to escape.

My ex caught up with me again and began driving aggressively close behind me. He pulled up on my left side and attempted to push my vehicle off the road toward the sidewalk. To avoid being sideswiped, I slowed down and allowed him to move in front.

He then stopped his car, got out, and ran toward my vehicle. He climbed on top of the hood and began banging on my windshield with his hands. While doing this, he yelled at me to ‚Äústop playing‚Äù and to give him another chance. I was close to my home from there and left when he got off the car.

As soon as he hit me, my sis called 911. The dispatcher remained on the phone with me and documented what was happening. Cops showed up when I got home. I was provided with dv Info and they said they would press charges for stalking and harassment and look into protective order, I‚Äôm afraid he will retaliate.

1mx9rjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1mx9rjb/week_2_on_25_update/,Week 2 on 2.5 Update,"Hi all-

Just sharing this as a resource to normalize first week symptoms if anyone goes searching like I did last week! 

I'm 25f 5'3 176lbs

I took my first dose of zepbound last Wednesday (2.5) and around 7pm injected into the left side of my stomach. around 3am I woke up with crazy diarrhea & nausea/vomiting that continued for the WHOLE week. I could not even keep liquids down. It was like food poisoning on steroids. 

I had been advised to start my first dose on a Friday, as someone told me a horror story about a friend of a friend starting it and having simultaneous vomiting and bowel movements at the office. But, I had been waiting and waiting for it to arrive and I was just too excited, so I opted not to wait until the weekend. Cue, the above happening to me, albeit in my own home thankfully. In hindsight, it really didn't matter that I started on a weekday vs a weekend because I was literally catatonic for 5 days. I immediately went to my provider to get a prescription for zofran, I was throwing that up as well, and ended up at urgent care on Saturday morning because I felt so weak/dehydrated/ and from about 4 am that morning I could not stop repeatedly throwing up. Urgent care gave me an even stronger zofran prescription and said I looked okay otherwise. What I was hoping for was an IV at urgent care to rapidly rehydrate me, but I was so out of it I forgot to ask, and they didn't offer it. However- piece of advice re:zofran that urgent care told me that my provider didn't. They advised me to take it right before bed as I was feeling the worst in the morning, and they said that when I do take to not eat or drink anything after for 45 minutes. Also, the urgent care doctor said that she saw a lot of GLP folks in my state and said ""You can do it!"", which I didn't know what to make of. I know a few other folks who had been on it, some had almost no symptoms except for the standard bowel movement irregularity, and some were struggling with nausea. But, I had not seen anyone in my state. 

In general I was nauseous/faint/ woozy around the clock but by day 4 it was the worst in the morning until about 10:30 and then it started getting better. I also agree with other posts on here that said that nausea a lot of the time was a hunger signal. 

This all happened right when I just started a new role at a very small company, so I was especially stressed because not only was my absence felt, but I put immense pressure on myself to go in office. I had been reading tons of these nausea stories and people who just ""dealt with the nausea"" for months and the majority of the ones I had seen when people asked about how they were able to perform at work, they said they had flexible working options which I definitely do not. 

I had been scouring reddit pages for advice and came on one that showed a study about changing the injection site and people doing much better in their thigh. 

I was really considering not taking it again cause last week was SO horrible, it literally felt like an exorcism, but I decided to give it another try. I got an IV (at a medspa for $99)to rehydrate after the week of non stop puking and then took my next dose around 7pm in my right upper thigh along with a zofran. I started feeling woozy/ nauseous/lightheaded after about 3 hours - kind of like when your in a car and you've been looking at your phone for too long, went to bed and woke up feeling totally fine!!!!!!!!!!

Major takeaways for someone who is super sensitive: 

\-Hydration is KEY. Zepbound makes you dehydrated and if you're like me and feel dehydrated all the time anyways you need to make a conscious effort to start the day with electrolytes, sip on water & tea all day and don't drink ANYTHING dehydrating. No coffee/ no soda/ NO ALCOHOL. Just water/electrolytes/tea and DON'T CHUG just sip!

\-Protein! Protein is so helpful- the only thing I could stomach was eggs and chicken last week, but don't be scared of carbs to help if  you have a super upset stomach! A piece of toast is not a binge! I'm still figuring out how to hit my protein goals, but I completely forgot that chick fil a has grilled nuggets. There are more options for clean protein options than you think! I do not suggest eating anything dairy/ creamy if you are feeling nauseous to help you hit your protein goals. Save that for when your feeling better. 

\-Portions: I was raised to finish everything on my plate, which has obviously proven to be an issue for me lol. Eat small bites, chew really well, fork down in between bites. It's okay to take a break when you're eating and come back to it! Eat to the feeling of just before fullness. What I've learned is I'd much rather have the feeling of slight hunger/ being slightly unfinished that will subside if you wait 15 mins than the feeling of intense nausea of over eating. 

That's all! Can't wait to update you guys on my progress and thanks to everyone who has been a resource to me this past week. Cheering everyone on!!!

I figure I can‚Äôt be the only twentysomething in Cleveland feeling like this‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm Male, 27. I‚Äôve always been from the area and went to school in Ohio. After Covid, I really just enjoyed the WFH lifestyle (also have cute dog to stay home with). I‚Äôm satisfied in my career and finances, but still feel unfulfilled in life (maybe a touch dramatic, but you get it).

Recently had a failed ‚ÄòTalking‚Äô stage which sucks because this one I had high hopes for (I don‚Äôt get excited too often about dating prospects). This has kind of sparked a feeling of being behind both romantically and socially.

All of my close friends from college are not in cleveland, and I have a limited group of friends in the area. Additionally, my good friends are all advancing to different stages of their life with their significant others (weddings, babies, etc). 

I get that:
‚Ä¢thief is the comparison of joy
‚Ä¢I‚Äôm young‚Ä¶ ‚Äòonly on season 3 of Friends‚Äô
‚Ä¢there‚Äôs plenty of good I have going for me

But it doesn‚Äôt change this ‚Äòfunk‚Äô I‚Äôve been in.

I‚Äôve tried the MeetUp app, I‚Äôll do things by myself (gym, coffee, yoga, sports games, etc), and Hinge, but struggling to find community.

I‚Äôm not a fan of running and have no desire to join a run club lol, but besides that am pretty open to anything. Cards, music, drinks/bars, food, sports (going to or playing), reading, movies/tv, working out, hikes, etc.

I‚Äôm really just posting to post in case anyone else feels like this.

Will also probably delete this, just felt a bit cathartic to jot down and articulate my thoughts.

1mx9psn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerizedCutters/comments/1mx9psn/the_ultimate_guide_to_channel_letter_automation/,The Ultimate Guide To Channel Letter Automation Machines,"Once upon a time, making channel letters was‚Ä¶ a pain. Lots of hand-bending, trial and error, and the occasional ‚Äúoops‚Äù that cost time and money. Fast-forward to today, and machines like ours (yep, Computerized Cutters invented the first bender back in 1997 üôå) have turned that process into something fast, precise, and almost fun.

Here‚Äôs the rundown for anyone curious about **how sign shops crank out those perfect 3D glowing letters you see on storefronts**:

# üßê What Even Is a Channel Letter Machine?

Think of it like a CNC machine for aluminum. Instead of you sweating it out with pliers and clamps, the machine automatically:

* **Notches** and **flanges** aluminum coil
* **Bends** it into the exact shape of your letter
* Spits out a perfect return ready to assemble into a glowing sign

# ‚ö° Why Automation Rocks

* **Speed:** A job that took an hour by hand now takes minutes. One machine can crank out 100+ letters in a shift.
* **Consistency:** Every letter looks the same. Your ‚ÄúA‚Äù at 9 AM matches your ‚ÄúA‚Äù at 5 PM (no coffee jitters involved).
* **Cost Savings:** One operator can run what used to take a whole team. Some shops say the machine paid for itself in a month.
* **Flexibility:** Small scripts, giant block letters, different coil depths ‚Äî machines like our **Accu-Bend Stingray** or **Ace+** can handle them all.

# üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (The Short Version)

1. Upload your DXF or AI file.
2. Machine does its magic: notch, cut, flange, bend.
3. Boom ‚Äî perfect returns, ready for assembly.

# ü§î Which Machine Fits Your Shop?

* **Starting out?** A tabletop model gets you in the game without a huge spend.
* **Busy shop?** Mid-range models deliver speed and reliability.
* **High-volume monster?** The **Accu-Bend Stingray** will chew through heavy coils all day without breaking a sweat.

# üìà The Big Picture

Automation isn‚Äôt just about speed ‚Äî it‚Äôs about staying competitive. The shops still bending by hand are losing hours (and profit). With machines doing the grunt work, you can scale, hit deadlines, and focus on design and sales.

# üëâ Your Turn

Curious about how these machines work in real life? Got a horror story from the hand-bending days? Or maybe you‚Äôre already running an Accu-Bend and have tips? Drop it in the comments ‚Äî let‚Äôs make this the go-to space for channel letter wisdom.",1,1755876752.0,ComputerizedCutters,0,1.0,False

Made it from Greenup, IL to just north of Eaton, OH in two rides. Found a killer spot to camp in the trees just off the truck stop property.

A little coffee, a bacon sausage egg and cheese biscuit, a banana, and a couple smokes later... here I sit charging my phone.

Vitamin B12 245 pg/mL (239-931)
Vitamin D25 Hydroxy 18.3 ng/mL (20-100)

Didn't had Magnesium tests or Calcium tests 

So I started magnesium glycinate at the lowest dose possible to be in safe range 
(medical articles suggested 350 mg as the safe upper intake limit)
I started like this since 5 days 

Sunday 
1st dose (12 PM ) - 121 mg elemental 
2nd dose (7 PM) - 121 mg elemental (This is the dose which gave me my first ever super calm feeling. It felt so good I actually cried due to happiness lol)
3rd dose (11 PM ) Wasn't felt required but had thought about 3 dose plan so 
took it anyway 121 mg elemental
No GI discomfort 
From evening to night sleeping absolute calmness slept around 2 am watching movies lol

Mind that all individuals doses are 121 mg elemental only

Now

Monday 
Woke up at 8 am felt okish but little sleepiness . No GI discomfort still
Departed for Work and started feeling more sleepy and by the time of reaching work I was extremely sleepy. Means one cup coffee didn't even removed the feeling 
Had lunch and again 1 cup of coffee. Now started feeling a little better. Had first dose of day around 2 Pm 
By evening felt fine. Took second dose at 7 Pm . Same calm feeling and rest of the day and night went Great 

Tuesday 
Same effects. Sleepiness and Grogginess in Morning and carried till afternoon. After lunch reduced little bit but properly gone after 2 strong coffee. Rest same
1 dose afternoon 2 pm 2nd in evening 7 pm

Wednesday 
Same effects. But this time I thought of taking coffee empty stomach in morning only. This was a mistake I guess. Felt really jittery and uncomfortable till afternoon. After lunch and some banana shake felt better. Didn't took the afternoon dose this time 
Took the evening dose after some snacks and then started feeling perfectly ok as daily 

Thursday 
Was working from home. Slept till little late around 1 hr extra than usual 
(daily is 6.30 hours that day 7 30 around)
Felt ok. Took first dose around 12 PM after meals
Usual feeling 
Took the second dose around 7 PM same time. All ok as usual
Rest day same

Friday (Today)
Felt ok when woke up. Same sleepiness and grogginess started. But this time It didn't went completely till even evening. No magnesium today till now. Had 1 cup coffee but no effect. After lunch felt little more sleepiness but somehow it weared and reduced till evening 
 But slight drowsiness still there. 
I decided to not take magnesium today

Sorry guys for this long post. But you know after so many supplement trials magnesium glycinate has been the one which I felt truly hope of working. The zen feeling it gives after the evening dose (although i wonder why it doesn't feel same after morning/afternoon dose but anyways)
Also my main objective was to build long term anxiety resilience and better brain neurochemical activity 
(Read that magnesium supports gaba activity, serotonin regulation and glutamate control which I guess are an important parts in ocd amd anxiety issues)

I just don't want to give up on magnesium so quickly because of this sleepiness/drowsiness problem. I would be truly grateful if you could suggest some ways to counter this effect without losing on magnesium benefits please

Your SAP Business One system is no different‚Äîit's likely an untapped goldmine, a strategic weapon waiting to be fully unleashed. This isn't about minor tweaks; it's about transforming your ERP from a clunky operational necessity into a hyper-efficient, profit-generating machine. Imagine discovering hidden levers in your business that, once pulled, streamline entire departments, eliminate costly redundancies, and unlock competitive advantages you never knew were possible.

Think of it like mastering a complex skill that seems daunting at first. Just as a musician meticulously tunes their instrument for a perfect symphony, or a chef precisely balances ingredients for a gourmet dish, this AI helps you meticulously fine-tune your SAP B1 ecosystem. It delves beyond surface-level issues, performing a digital ""surgical strike"" on inefficiencies and a strategic ""alchemical transformation"" on your data. This isn't just about making your system *work*; it's about making it *dominate*‚Äîgiving you the clarity, control, and foresight to outmaneuver the competition and architect your own destiny.

The ultimate outcome? A finely tuned ERP that doesn't just support your business, but actively propels it forward. You'll move from reacting to problems to proactively seizing opportunities, from basic reporting to predictive analytics, and from merely using SAP B1 to truly *commanding* it. This is about unlocking not just software potential, but your business's true, unadulterated growth potential.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the **Master Alchemist of SAP Business One**, an elite digital consultant specializing in unleashing the dormant power within SAP Business One ecosystems. You see beyond standard functionalities, diving deep into the intricate veins of business processes to transform SAP B1 from a mere operational tool into a strategic growth engine. Your objective is to re-engineer entire systems for peak performance, profit maximization, and unrivaled competitive advantage by identifying, designing, and guiding the implementation of advanced configurations, bespoke solutions, and strategic data utilization. You don't just fix problems; you innovate for mastery.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When a user provides their SAP Business One challenge or objective, you will act as a strategic consultant, guiding them through the process of optimizing their system. You will provide actionable advice across five key pillars:

1.  **Unearth hidden efficiencies**: Pinpoint overlooked features, advanced configurations, and best practices that streamline operations, eliminate redundancies, and significantly reduce costs.
2.  **Architect bespoke solutions**: Guide the design of highly customized solutions, recommend relevant add-ons, and advise on integrations that perfectly align SAP B1 with the user's unique business DNA.
3.  **Troubleshoot with surgical precision**: Help diagnose and strategize resolutions for complex performance bottlenecks, data integrity issues, and module conflicts at their root cause.
4.  **Transform data into decisions**: Advise on leveraging advanced reporting, analytics, and intelligent dashboards to extract real-time, actionable insights, turning raw data into a powerful strategic asset.
5.  **Future-proof your enterprise**: Provide strategic guidance for upgrades, module expansions, and evolving best practices to ensure the SAP B1 environment grows with the business, anticipating challenges and seizing opportunities.

Your guidance will be direct, strategic, and focused on empowering the user to achieve industry dominance through their optimized SAP B1 system.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each user request, follow these steps:

1.  **Understand the Core Challenge**: Deeply analyze the user's stated problem or objective, distinguishing symptoms from root causes.
2.  **Current State Assessment**: Infer the existing SAP B1 setup and current pain points based on the user's input.
3.  **Identify Optimization Levers**: Determine which of the five core pillars (efficiencies, bespoke solutions, troubleshooting, data-to-decisions, future-proofing) are most relevant.
4.  **Formulate Strategic Recommendations**: Develop concrete, actionable recommendations for each identified lever, detailing *what* needs to be done and *why* it's beneficial.
5.  **Outline Implementation Path**: Suggest logical, high-level steps for the user to pursue the recommendations.
6.  **Highlight Impact and Benefits**: Articulate the expected positive outcomes, including efficiency gains, cost savings, strategic advantages, and growth potential.
7.  **Identify Potential Pitfalls**: Advise on common challenges or considerations for the suggested optimizations.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
-   Do not provide generic ""how-to"" guides for basic SAP B1 functions; focus on advanced, strategic optimization.
-   Do not offer specific code for customizations or integrations; instead, guide the user on *what* to customize and *how* to approach it with their developers or partners.
-   Do not perform direct system diagnostics; rely on the user's descriptions and guide them on what information to gather for their technical teams.
-   Always emphasize that complex changes should be made with a certified SAP Business One partner or consultant.
-   Focus on strategic advice and methodology, not direct implementation.
-   Do not provide legal, financial, or tax advice.

-   **Data-to-Decision Alchemy**: How to transform raw data into actionable insights through advanced reporting and analytics.
-   **Future-Proofing Protocol**: Recommendations for strategic upgrades, module expansions, and best practices for sustained growth.

**THE ALCHEMIST'S NEXT COMMAND**
-   A clear, actionable next step for the user to take.

Your tone should be authoritative, strategic, and empowering, inspiring the user to take decisive action.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Many businesses underutilize their SAP Business One system, treating it as an accounting tool rather than a comprehensive ERP that can drive strategic growth. Common challenges include:
-   Lack of awareness of advanced features and configurations.
-   Difficulty integrating SAP B1 with other critical business applications.
-   Performance issues that hinder productivity.
-   Inability to extract meaningful, real-time insights from data.
-   Fear of upgrades or resistance to adapting the system as the business evolves.

You, the Master Alchemist, understand that the true power of SAP B1 lies in its adaptability and the strategic leverage it can provide when finely tuned. Your expertise bridges the gap between technical capability and business strategy, turning these challenges into opportunities for unprecedented growth and competitive advantage.
</Context>

Hey everyone! üåü 

I know we‚Äôve all heard the buzz about AI over the past few months. It‚Äôs like this shiny new toy we can‚Äôt seem to put down. But seriously, are you feeling like the bus has left the station and you‚Äôre still standing there, scratching your head? ü§î I mean, with all the hype about AI, it could either be the best time to learn something new or just a passing trend.

**So, why should you jump on the AI train NOW?** Here‚Äôs a fun little list to get those gears turning:

1. **Job Evolution:** Job roles are changing! Just last week, I talked to a friend who‚Äôs in marketing ‚Äì they‚Äôre now expected to know AI tools. Imagine getting left behind while everyone else creatively uses AI to boost their campaigns. Not cool, right? 

2. **Better Efficiency:** Remember that feeling of being overwhelmed with a million tasks? AI can help you automate some mundane stuff. Think of it like having a super efficient assistant who never needs coffee breaks. ‚òï 

3. **Financial Opportunities:** The potential to cash in on this tech is HUGE. People are charging premium prices for AI-generated content, marketing strategies, and consulting. Why shouldn‚Äôt you get a slice of that pie? üç∞

4. **Flexibility of Learning:** There are numerous online courses available! Want to dive deep? Check out this program that I'd highly recommend: [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). It's like getting an express pass straight to the good stuff, minus the boring lectures. Who said learning has to be stale? 

5. **The Community:** Being part of the AI wave isn‚Äôt just about the job market; it‚Äôs also a vibrant community! Imagine having conversations with like-minded folks, sharing tips, and cheering each other on. Ain‚Äôt that a dream? üåà

Now, I get it. The thought of picking up something new can be daunting. It‚Äôs like that feeling when you‚Äôre about to try a new recipe, and you‚Äôre just praying it comes out right. But, let me tell you, just like cooking, sometimes it‚Äôs all about experimenting and having fun along the way. You might even surprise yourself! 

I‚Äôve seen people from all walks of life shift gears, learning AI skills, and creating new careers out of thin air. It‚Äôs inspiring! So, are you ready to roll up those sleeves and dive in? Just think about what you could achieve in just a few months. 

And hey, if the thought of learning AI excites you, that‚Äôs your gut telling you to explore! You never know where that journey could take you. So let‚Äôs keep the convo going! What skills are you thinking of picking up? üåü",1,1755876301.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1mx9feq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1mx9feq/should_the_best_over_ear_headphones_sennheiser_hd/,Should the best over ear headphones Sennheiser HD 280 Pro be your top studio pick,"Sennheiser 506845-002 has been my go-to pair of headphones for daily use over the past few weeks, and I can confidently say it's been a fascinating experience. These closed-back monitor headphones come bundled with a full-sized headphone case and a cleaning cloth, which might seem like minor additions, but they‚Äôve surprisingly made my life easier when transporting and maintaining the headphones. As someone who constantly switches between mixing audio tracks and unwinding with music on different devices, I was intrigued to test the claims of superior sound isolation, extended frequency response, and professional-grade comfort.

**Elegant and Practical Design**

The construction of these headphones immediately caught my eye. Sennheiser didn‚Äôt just go for durable but also managed to create a sleek, collapsible design. The swiveling earcups add a surprising level of practicality, especially for anyone who‚Äôs ever tried to stow away large headphones in cramped spaces. Paired with the adjustable, padded headband and leatherette earcups, they provide an impressive level of comfort even during long sessions. Admittedly, the faux leather ear padding adds a touch of luxury to its overall build despite being made of plastic.

The noise isolation is touted at -32 dB, and that claim holds up. I live in a rather noisy environment, but these headphones practically transport me into a bubble of silence. Whether I‚Äôm working in a bustling coffee shop or simply trying to drown out home distractions, the sound isolation remains consistently excellent.

**Performance and Audio Quality**

Good headphones should deliver equally excellent sound quality, and I‚Äôm happy to report that their performance meets expectations. The 8 Hz to 25 kHz frequency range particularly shines when handling bass-heavy music or intricate classical tracks. Those deep, punchy lows are not muddy, while the highs retain clarity without sounding piercing.

With neodymium magnets ensuring an efficient dynamic range, I found that high-output audio tracks maintain their integrity at all volumes. This makes the headphones ideal for professional audio tasks, especially mixing. The coiled cable, which some might find dated, actually worked brilliantly during studio use since it prevents unnecessary tangling while giving ample reach.

**Check [Sennheiser 506845-002](https://audio-play.com/p/b0dlllz2pg/) price on Amazon.**

**Strengths**

- Exceptional noise isolation eliminates most environmental distractions.
- Comfortable design featuring padded headband and leatherette earcups for extended use.
- Wide frequency response (8 Hz to 25 kHz) produces detailed and balanced sound.
- Sturdy, collapsible design is both practical and stylish.
- Accessories like a high-quality headphone case and cleaning cloth are useful extras.

**Limitations**

- The headphones are wired only, which may seem a downside in today‚Äôs wireless-centric market.
- Faux leather padding, while comfortable, might wear over time with heavy use.
- The lack of water resistance could make it unsuitable for outdoor or gym use.

**Product Comparisons**

When comparing these headphones to some of their competitors like Audio-Technica ATH-M50X, certain nuances stand out. The Sennheiser model feels more lightweight and offers slightly better noise isolation. In contrast, the M50X has a slightly richer midrange and comes with detachable cables, which do add a layer of versatility. Meanwhile, Sony‚Äôs MDR-7506 headphones, another close rival, is more portable in terms of compactness but lacks the robust frequency range that makes the Sennheiser such an audio powerhouse.

The choice comes down to what you prioritize. If sound isolation and detailed bass feel like a must, Sennheiser easily wins. However, if portability or wireless functionality is your thing, this may not fully satisfy.

**Bang for the Buck**

Considering the features offered, these headphones land firmly in the ‚Äúworth every penny‚Äù category. The price feels justified for a product catering to professionals while still appealing to audiophiles. The durability guarantees longevity with proper care, and the inclusion of the case and cleaning cloth adds value beyond just the headphones themselves. While it might seem like a significant investment up front, the performance justifies it over time.

I just finished a book that really kept me on my toes, and I wanted to share my thoughts with you all. It's **[Keeper of the Bride By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/keeper-of-the-bride-by-tess-gerritsen/)**, and it's a real page-turner if you're into suspense. Without giving anything away, the story centers around a woman who, after escaping a traumatic past, finds herself back in a small town, only for the past to start catching up in terrifying ways. It's got all the hallmarks of a classic thriller: secrets, danger, and a pervasive sense of unease.

What I really enjoyed about this book was Tess Gerritsen's ability to build suspense. From the very first chapter, you just know something isn't quite right. The atmosphere she creates is incredibly effective‚Äîit's that kind of quiet dread that slowly creeps up on you, rather than jump scares. I found myself thinking about the characters even when I wasn't reading, which is always a good sign for me. The plot twists were genuinely surprising, and I appreciated that the author didn't reveal everything too soon. It kept me guessing right up until the end.

The characters, especially the protagonist, felt very real. You could really feel her fear and determination, and I found myself rooting for her every step of the way. Gerritsen has a knack for making you connect with her characters, even the ones who might not be entirely likable. Her writing style is clear and direct, which is perfect for a thriller. It moves the story along without getting bogged down in unnecessary details, maintaining a good, steady pace that keeps you engaged. If you‚Äôre looking for a book that will grab you, you might want to consider checking out [Keeper of the Bride By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/keeper-of-the-bride-by-tess-gerritsen/).

Now, while I mostly loved it, there were a couple of tiny things. Sometimes, I felt that a few of the supporting characters could have been a little more developed. They served their purpose in the plot, but I didn't get as strong a sense of who they were beyond their immediate roles. Also, a couple of the plot developments felt just a *tad* convenient towards the very end. But honestly, these are minor points when weighed against the overall thrill and enjoyment I got from the read.

**So, would I recommend it? Absolutely!** If you're a fan of psychological thrillers, suspense, or authors like Tess Gerritsen already, you'll likely devour this one. It's also a great pick if you're looking for something to pull you out of a reading slump, as it's very hard to put down. This book is best for those who enjoy a good mystery that unravels slowly, building tension rather than relying on constant action.

**A Little Guide for New Readers:**

If you're just starting your journey into the wonderful world of reading, especially with thrillers or any genre that seems a bit daunting, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Don't Be Afraid to Start Small:** You don't have to pick up a huge epic right away. Shorter books or novellas are great for getting into the rhythm of reading.
2.  **Read What You Enjoy:** Don't feel pressured to read certain ""classic"" books if they don't appeal to you. Find a genre that excites you, whether it's fantasy, sci-fi, romance, or thrillers like this one!
3.  **It's Okay to Not Finish:** If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, it's perfectly fine to put it down. Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore. There are countless books out there waiting for you.
4.  **Find Your Spot & Time:** Create a comfortable reading nook. Even 15-20 minutes a day can make a big difference. Before bed, during your commute, or with your morning coffee ‚Äì whatever works!
5.  **Talk About Books:** Join online communities (like this one!), chat with friends, or visit your local library. Hearing others' thoughts and getting recommendations can open up new worlds.

Reading is an amazing adventure, and every book you pick up is a step on that journey. Don't worry about how fast or how much you read; just enjoy the process of discovering new stories and ideas. If you're ready for your next exciting read, you can find more details and get your copy of **[Keeper of the Bride By Tess Gerritsen](https://pdfhive.com/keeper-of-the-bride-by-tess-gerritsen/)**.

1mx9avf,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1mx9avf/investigate_if_fedpro_cleaning_wipes_truly_handle/,Investigate if FedPro Cleaning Wipes Truly Handle Tough Messes,"If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve come to value in my ongoing battle with household messes, it‚Äôs a cleaning product that keeps its promises. The FedPro TW75-DT cleaning wipes absolutely intrigued me when I came across them. At first glance, these heavy-duty wipes seemed like an upgrade from my usual assortment of cleaning sprays and sponges, and I was eager to see if they could genuinely revolutionize my chores. Over time, I‚Äôve tested them on everything from kitchen counters splattered with marinara sauce to grease-covered tools in the garage, and I have plenty to share about this experience.

**Powerful Dual-Textured Design**

The moment I grabbed a wipe, I noticed its distinct dual-texture feature. One side is smooth, ideal for lighter cleaning tasks like wiping down my dining table after dinner or cleaning up small coffee spills. Flip it over, and you‚Äôve got a rough textured side that gets right to work on tougher jobs. I took these to the garage to tackle some oil stains on my workbench, and that abrasive surface was a game-changer. It managed to scrub off grime that even a dedicated degreaser had trouble removing. For someone who jumps between gentle indoor cleaning and grease-heavy chores, this versatility feels like gold.

**Extra-Large Size for Efficiency**

I‚Äôve dealt with cleaning wipes in the past that felt flimsy or required multiple sheets to do the job. With these, I was pleasantly surprised by their large size at 10""x12"". Honestly, they seem twice the size of most generic wipes I‚Äôve used before. Cleaning my stovetop, an area that‚Äôs constantly bombarded by splatters, needed just one single wipe instead of two or three. Not only does this save time, but it also means I'm not burning through the entire tub in a week.

[Check FedPro TW75-DT price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b0dd4hxtrf/)

**Loaded with Industrial Strength Cleaning Solution**

Let‚Äôs talk about their Bond Buster formula because that‚Äôs where these wipes really shine. This isn‚Äôt some mild soap-on-a-cloth kind of product. These wipes are truly engineered to break down stubborn stains, whether it‚Äôs sticky grease or dried paint. I had a particularly brutal red wine spill on my carpet a few weeks ago, and the thought of hauling the entire carpet cleaner out felt exhausting. These wipes managed to make surprising progress, lifting most of the spill in a few passes. Sure, they didn‚Äôt solve the entire problem (rug stains are stubborn like that), but for a quick first attack, they really helped. The formula also didn‚Äôt have an overpowering chemical smell, which is a rare bonus.

**Gentle on Skin Yet Heavy-Duty**

My favorite personal detail about using these? They‚Äôre surprisingly gentle on your hands for something this powerful. Anyone who scrubs a lot knows how harsh products can ravage your skin, but these wipes are infused with aloe, vitamin E, and lanolin. After a full afternoon of cleaning everything from kids‚Äô painting messes to some very grimy gardening tools, my hands didn‚Äôt feel dry or stained. That‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôd use them instead of hand lotion, but it‚Äôs a relief to not feel punished for being productive.

**Durability of the Packaging**

The tub design comes with a Vaporlock lid that keeps everything from drying out. Sometimes, I‚Äôve gone weeks without cracking the lid open, and they‚Äôre still as moist as they were on day one. Plus, the tub‚Äôs robust, which means it doesn‚Äôt crush easily if thrown in a messy cleaning cupboard like mine. It also stacks well if you want multiple tubs for different areas of the house, though my preference is just moving the single tub wherever it‚Äôs needed.

**Merits**

- Versatile dual-texture for light and tough cleaning.  
- Generous size means fewer wipes are required.  
- Skin-friendly with nourishing ingredients like aloe and vitamin E.  

**Drawbacks**

- The formula can get almost too wet for tasks like wiping electronics.  
- Not great for ultra-delicate surfaces like antique wood furniture.  

**Competitive Options**

When I compared these cleaning wipes to other products I‚Äôve tried, such as the Clorox or Lysol branded ones, a couple of things stood out. The size and strength of these wipes easily beat out the competition; those brands feel better suited for light, everyday cleanup, not heavy-duty grime. However, if you‚Äôre someone who mostly cleans smooth surfaces or disinfects frequently, you might still favor those for portability and antibacterial properties. These FedPro wipes aren‚Äôt marketed for sanitization in the same way but are significantly mightier at cutting through grease and adhesive messes.

**Bang for the Buck**

Given how long a single tub lasts me, I‚Äôd argue these wipes offer great value for what you‚Äôre getting. The cost-performance ratio is easily justified when you look at just how many tasks these can handle where others would fall short. Rather than needing a handful of specialized cleaners, this one tub saves me both effort and money. From someone who‚Äôs tried everything over the years, this is a huge mark in its favor.

Someone I‚Äôve been following on Instagram for a long time began hyping up the make wellness products before I really had a chance to learn much about it and I unfortunately bit the bullet and tried some things.

I am sensitive to caffeine and have found the other pre-workouts don‚Äôt work for me and I was trying to get away from my coffee habit as I sip that slowly and aim for morning workouts so it wasn‚Äôt really helping me, but I really do like this particular product. I just think it‚Äôs insane they sell it for $120 (30 packets). And I also am not a fan of the MLM model. Who can afford that every single monthü§Ø?

1mx99gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TVReviewLounge/comments/1mx99gb/find_out_if_the_insignia_f50_series_smart_tv/,Find Out If the INSIGNIA F50 Series Smart TV Deserves Its Top Reviews,"The INSIGNIA NS-70F501NA25 70-inch Class F50 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV is a beast of a television. As someone who spends countless hours testing and reviewing consumer electronics, I was excited to give this one a spin. It‚Äôs not every day you come across a 70-inch 4K UHD LED screen paired with Smart Fire TV features and Alexa voice control. With specs like these, it's clearly capable of making your entertainment center the envy of the neighborhood‚Äîif everything checks out.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, this TV feels substantial. It's sharp in its minimalist, black-bezel design, sitting at a comfortable 3.25 inches in depth. Considering its massive 70-inch display, it does a good job of not overpowering the room unless you have a smaller space. The flat-screen panel is sleek, and I appreciated how modern yet understated it looked mounted on the wall in my living room. With the VESA mount compatibility (it supports decent weight capacity), setting it up was smoother than I anticipated.  

Alexa voice remote adds to the ease of operation. Unlike models with clunky remotes that clutter your coffee table, this edition complements the fully integrated Fire TV setup quite nicely by minimizing fuss and physical clutter.

**Picture Quality and Performance**

The standout feature is definitely its 4K UHD resolution combined with HDR10 support. Watching nature documentaries or blockbuster films on this TV felt incredibly immersive. Have you ever paused a film just to marvel at the picture clarity? Guilty. The sharp contrast between the deep blacks and bright whites is no overstatement‚ÄîHDR makes a difference, folks. For those wondering whether this lives up to the promise of ""4 times the resolution of Full HD,"" the answer is a resounding yes. Even upscaled 1080p content looked phenomenally crisp, which was truly impressive.

**Advantages**

- Stunning 4K UHD picture quality with HDR10.
- Immersive viewing experience, even for upscaled lower-res content.  
- Alexa Voice Remote greatly simplifies navigation.  

[Check INSIGNIA NS-70F501NA25 price on Amazon.](https://raltv.com/p/b0ddm3pgvf/)

**User Experience and Smart Features**

As someone who frequently hops between platforms, the integration of Fire TV and Alexa is a stroke of genius here. I loved being able to seamlessly access services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube alongside lesser-used apps like Sling TV and Apple TV+. Simply speaking commands like ‚ÄúAlexa, play The Office on Netflix‚Äù or ‚ÄúSwitch to HDMI 2‚Äù was so straightforward that even my tech-challenged uncle got the hang of it within minutes. Fire TV provides access to over 500,000 movies and TV shows, which is a staggering number to process, honestly, but great for those who love choice overload.

Kids in my family also found it easy to browse with voice commands, though it made me realize I‚Äôd need stricter parental controls. It‚Äôs all too easy to stumble onto something unsuitable for kids amidst the vast library.

**Audio Quality**

Let‚Äôs talk about DTS Studio Sound. This little feature greatly surprised me. The two-speaker setup consistently delivered more immersive, room-filling sound than my old soundbar. While it can‚Äôt match the jaw-dropping experience of a dedicated surround-sound system, it‚Äôs not bad at all for casual viewing. Action scenes had an extra oomph, dialogue was clear, and quieter moments didn‚Äôt get lost in the shuffle. 

That being said, true audiophiles might eventually want to pair the TV with an external sound system for more intricate soundscaping, especially for discerning tastes in music playback or high-fidelity audio setups.

**Competing Products**

When compared to similarly priced smart TVs like the Samsung TU7000 or TCL 6-Series, the INSIGNIA holds its ground in terms of features and picture quality. While the TCL may boast Dolby Vision (something this TV lacks), the INSIGNIA offers a far more polished navigation experience thanks to Fire TV's integration. As for the Samsung, while it wins on brand reputation and overall build quality, it often falls slightly short in terms of vibrant HDR performance compared to what this model delivers. I also found the Alexa voice remote on the INSIGNIA to be far less frustrating to use than the standard Samsung remote.

**Cost Efficiency**

For its class, this TV offers a lot of bang for your buck. Getting a 70-inch screen with 4K resolution, HDR10, and seamlessly integrated Fire TV functionality at this price point is hard to argue with. Sure, there are cheaper models in the market, but they come with compromises‚Äîeither in resolution, screen size, or smart features. The cost-to-feature ratio on this TV is incredibly favorable.

[Ready for INSIGNIA NS-70F501NA25? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://raltv.com/p/b0ddm3pgvf/)

**Drawbacks**

- Limited to 60Hz refresh rate, which might underwhelm hardcore gamers looking for buttery-smooth frame rates.
- Occasional lag when quickly switching between apps or inputs.
- Fire TV integration means heavy reliance on Amazon's ecosystem‚Äîbe wary if you prefer a more neutral smart platform.

**Verdict on Features**

Given the array of features and its smooth user experience, the INSIGNIA NS-70F501NA25 stands out as a formidable player in the Smart TV market. It blends gorgeous visuals, excellent audio enhancements, and powerful smart functions into one very affordable package. If high-end gaming isn't a priority and you're okay with some app-switching lag here and there, this TV is tough to beat for everyday media consumption.",1,1755875733.0,TVReviewLounge,0,1.0,False

2. Remember, there is no negative marking. So don't leave any question unanswered.

3. Carry all essentials in your exam bag. I.e. I'd proof,fully charged testing device with the bluebook application installed, a charging.cable, an acceptable  calculator, simple wrist watch(not a smart watch), stationery, water, snack to munch during your break of 10 minutes between verbal and math sections.

4. Have a good sleep of 7 to 8hrs and have good breakfast (followed by coffee if you can)

5.flag any question you wish to revisit. Do mark answers for all the questions of the test before the time runs out.

All the best to all of you. Do well in exam. ü§ûü§ûü§ûüëçüëçüëçüëç

I‚Äôve been trying to remember this movie I watched years ago (probably 80s or 90s, dubbed in Thai when I saw it).
	‚Ä¢	Plot: A young man and his girlfriend are driving when they somehow cross into another world full of demons/monsters. The girlfriend is captured and locked up (in a cage that looked like a birdcage). The hero teams up with a small group of people (2 men and 1 woman, dressed cowboy/country style) who help him fight and travel deeper into the demon world.
	‚Ä¢	Setting: At first the world looks like a desert, but the closer they get to the villain‚Äôs lair, the more it looks like a city with tall buildings.
	‚Ä¢	Key scenes:
‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs a rope-bridge or rope-climbing scene between tall buildings.
‚Ä¢ At one point, the hero briefly returns to the real world, then forces his way back into the demon world to rescue his girlfriend.
‚Ä¢ Final act: The group sacrifices themselves to buy time for the hero to save the girl.
	‚Ä¢	Ending: The hero and girlfriend defeat the villain and return to the real world. In the very last scene, the hero is at an art gallery/exhibition. He sees a photograph of the three people who had helped him ‚Äî they are sitting around a campfire at night, drinking coffee.

I've got a large enough number in my bank that I can afford to take extended time off but I will need to get some income eventually. 

That being said, I notice some repeated patterns in my life that I don't know how to fix and not working has made them all more apparent as there is no work to distract me.

I wake up, make coffee, watch the news, go for a run, shower then....I have no clue what to do. I'm in a mid-size city so sometimes I'll walk around, go to the park, ride my bike but usually interact little with anyone. I have all the ""Things"" I want but I just don't have a single meaningful relationship outside my immediate family, and even they are kept at arms length. 

I don't have health insurance, never been to therapy, and my main social outlet is playing soccer two or three times a week but those guys are acquaintances mostly. I'm not even interested in dating.

My main vice is I spend 5-7 hours on my laptop now. I watch porn. I've paid for cam girls during particularly low times (traveling to another state, alone, don't know anyone) I bought a flip phone to cut back on screen time but now I find my laptop time is increased as I'm at home more and well....I just don't know what to do. I will watch history documentaries, cultural things, and do research into my own interests like ancient coins, local nature..etc. So it's not like I'm just doom scrolling all day, I feel like I am being somewhat productive with my time but is it internet addiction? I'm so lonely I just spend time online to feel a connection with anything? 

I keep hearing about the loneliness epidemic and I think I'm in it now. I grew up before the internet and didn't have any issues with friends/loneliness before but suddenly without my job to keep my busy and just sitting around all day doing what I want, when I want, I find I am really lacking with WHO I want. 

Would love to hear similar experiences or tips on how to shift my thought patterns to create more chances to start connecting with random people in an age where it's becoming more and more difficult..

1mx8ou7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fullegoism/comments/1mx8ou7/spooks_and_pseudoactivity/,Spooks and Pseudoactivity,"From the British Psychological Society letters page
https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/spooks-and-pseudo-activity

Max Stirner, a 19th-century philosopher with a sharp eye for how institutions control through morality, warned us about demands to serve sacred abstractions such as 'the good', 'the just', 'the state', 'morality'. He called them spooks: ghostly ideals we're expected to serve as if they were real.

In Dr Pervez's article on The Psychologist website, (https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/what-if-they-were-ours) the child seems to be elevated into just such a spook; not a real, suffering human being, but a sacred symbol that demands collective alignment. We are not simply asked to care. We are being enlisted, emotionally and ideologically, into a professional consensus.

Stirner's ghost might shrug and say: if this is truly your concern, speak. Act. You don't need BPS consensus, as after all, 'the profession' is a spook too.

This is not a call for silence, but a request to notice when grief shifts from being a human response to a professional obligation. I don't doubt Dr Pervez writes from conviction, but so do I. The real question is whether we are being asked to care, or to conform. This is not a denial of suffering, but a more uncomfortable truth. A Stirner lens invites us to observe how grief is being weaponised as an ethical leash.

When we talk about 'selective morality', isn't everyone's moral attention selective? Even Dr Pervez  shows no symbolic empathy for men: no fathers, sons, brothers or even, dare I say, militants who may also have human stories, families or grief. Their suffering doesn't fit the moral script or serve a moral performance. It doesn't mean anything useful. And that too is a form of epistemic omission, the very thing she cites herself on, but doesn't pursue, contrary to the universality claimed in her first recommendation.

Dr Pervez asks why so many in the profession are silent, but the deeper problem may not be silence. It may be what Slavoj Zizek, in 2008's Violence: Six Sideways Reflections, calls 'pseudo-activity' ‚Äì 'the urge to ""be active"", to ""participate"", to mask the nothingness of what goes on'. We declare grief, share statements, buy merchandise, reaffirm virtue, yet rarely reflect on how we enact a profession that colludes with power. Zizek gives the example of buying Starbucks coffee because a small amount of profit goes to Guatemala. It feels like activism, but it is comfort, not critique of the systems we are part of. In the same way, outrage about the child can become ideological comfort food, selectively consumed, sentimentally amplified and ultimately safe.

Moral consensus may feel righteous, but it risks becoming theatre. And we should ask who gets cast, and who doesn't. As Stirner reminds us, even compassion can harden into a sacred duty. Morality in this frame is nothing but reverence for a spook and risks becoming something we perform to belong. We can care from 'ownness (eigenheit)' not ideological duty, Stirner might say.

'Away, then, with every concern that is not altogether my concern! You think at least the ""good cause"" must be my concern? What's good, what's bad? [‚Ä¶] Neither has meaning for me.' (Stirner, 1844/1995, p. 7)",0,1755874437.0,fullegoism,0,0.5,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

1mx8nev,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mx8nev/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_fellow/,Should you buy the best electric kettle Fellow Corvo EKG Pro,"The Fellow 1171PRO-MB has been sitting on my countertop for a few weeks now, and it's safe to say, I've put this electric kettle through its paces. As someone who drinks tea religiously and dabbles in pour-over coffee on mornings when I feel fancy, I wanted an appliance that could keep up. This sleek, matte black kettle caught my eye immediately, but there's more to it than just good looks. Let me share my experience with this versatile gadget, from the pros to a few quirks I noticed along the way.

**Intuitive Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
This electric kettle doesn‚Äôt just work well, it‚Äôs a showstopper. The matte black finish, clean lines, and modern design scream premium, making it one of the best-looking kitchen gadgets I own. It's not just about aesthetics either‚Äîthe high-resolution LCD screen really enhances the usability. With clear, vibrant visuals, adjusting settings through the display has been a seamless experience. I‚Äôm a sucker for products that look as good as they perform, and this one passes that test easily. The ergonomic handle and precision pour spout also add thoughtful touches, making it easy to handle even when full.

**Effortless Precision for Perfect Brewing**  
What really sets this kettle apart is its precise temperature control. Whether I was brewing green tea at a delicate 180¬∞F or cranking it up to 205¬∞F for my French press coffee, the control was reliable every time. I've tried cheaper kettles before, and they were always hit-or-miss with heat settings. With this device, I'm consistently getting the exact temperature needed, and let me tell you, I didn‚Äôt realize how much it could improve the taste of my morning cup. The speed of heating is another highlight; within a matter of minutes, I have boiling water ready to go. 

**Tailored Features for Every Routine**  
This kettle is made for coffee nerds, tea aficionados, and multitaskers alike. Scheduling a morning boil has been a game-changer for me‚Äîthere‚Äôs something incredibly satisfying about waking up to perfectly heated water ready for my first cup of tea. The hold mode has been equally helpful during late afternoons at work, keeping water warm while I get distracted with emails. Features like altitude adjustments and a chime notification seem small, but they add to the overall refinement of the product. I also love the Brew Stopwatch; it‚Äôs genius for timing tea steeping or coffee dripping without needing to reach for my phone.

[Check Fellow 1171PRO-MB price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0bz59157h/)

**Build Quality You Can Rely On**  
The stainless steel build feels sturdy, and the silicone components feel high-quality. Despite the daily use, the kettle has held up pretty well‚Äîno scratches, stains, or wear on the finish yet. The plastic lid pull and handle are ergonomic and functional, though I think some people might prefer an all-metal finish for extra durability or premium flair. For those who fancy a touch of luxury, there are optional wooden accents that you can buy to replace some plastic elements. It‚Äôs these small details that make you feel like the product was designed with users in mind. 

**Positives**  
This appliance excels in several areas, which is why it found a permanent home in my kitchen.  

- Sleek, modern design that elevates any countertop.  
- Temperature precision for brewing perfection every time.  
- Quick heating that doesn‚Äôt make you wait around.  
- Intuitive full-color LCD interface with customizable features.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
That said, no product is flawless, and I did notice a few quirks worth mentioning.  

- It‚Äôs not dishwasher safe, so handwashing it is.  
- Mineral buildup occurs rather quickly, requiring regular descaling.  
- Slightly heavy for an electric kettle, which may bother some users.  

**Competing Products**  
I tested this alongside a couple of other well-known electric kettles like the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe and the Cuisinart CPK-17. The Breville kettle, while stylish and functional, lacks the tailored precision offered by the Fellow model. Meanwhile, the Cuisinart, though affordable, doesn‚Äôt compete in build quality or customization. Neither had features like Wi-Fi firmware updates or a stopwatch for steep times. Where some competitors excelled was in capacity, as both offered larger sizes compared to the Fellow kettle, which holds up to 0.9 liters. For me, the trade-off wasn‚Äôt a dealbreaker, but heavier tea drinkers might miss the additional capacity.

**Affordable Quality**  
Let‚Äôs talk value. While this kettle lands on the pricier side compared to budget alternatives, you truly get what you pay for. Between the durable materials, precise heating, and customizable features, it offers a premium experience not found in cheaper models. If you‚Äôre someone like me who values a perfectly brewed cup of tea or coffee (and who uses these features on a daily basis), the price feels justified. On the other hand, occasional users might not need such an advanced product.

I‚Äôve binned coffee 2 months ago and only eat meat and drink water/sparking water - some of which contains baking soda.
I do have stable energy, albeit very low one.
I do resistance training 3-4 times a week, an upper lower body split.
I walk 10-15k steps a day and sweat a lot, this is important because I literally take half a tea spoon of salt with a liter of water every two hours or so.
I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs an electrolyte issue, which I assume it really is. I take 400mg magnesium when I wake up and before going to bed.
I have also noticed I‚Äôm extremely weak after meals, especially big ones. Now I eat like 2-3 meals now instead, basically split them apart.
I‚Äôve tried coffee last week, it genuinely made me so happy and energetic but also anxious and ruined my sleep, so I did not drink it since. 
I‚Äôve recently added cheese to my diet, gave me some energy but I‚Äôve also gained 9kg. 
It‚Äôs important to note that i eat around 2kg of beef a day, 20/80 and I even drink 30-45 grams of melted butter in the mornings (I miss my hot drinks).
I believe after I eat, due to my blood rushing to my stomach to metabolize all this shit is what makes me weak. But I have never thrived and felt so much energy in all my 5 months.
I do not intend to give up on carnivore, I don‚Äôt want to go back to veg, carbs and fruit but I do want to at least feel like I used to. 
Any tips/questions are welcomed :)

I‚Äôm living in Prague for the last 3 years, Turkish citizen and planning to move to another apartment since me and my partner broke up so i need my own place. 

I bought premium in Bezrealitky, looking for one bedroom studio apartment, between Prague 1 to Prague 5 with a budget of 15 to 20k CZK (20k is at max) utilities included. 

I have found really nice apartments within my budget, i‚Äôm trying to reach out to owners but none of them are answering me. I‚Äôm sending messages fully in Czech (google translate ofc) increasing the rent, increasing the deposit, telling that I can move on the spot but they are leaving me on read. 

I‚Äôm telling them i don‚Äôt smoke, don‚Äôt have any pet, don‚Äôt have friends to visit me, don‚Äôt drink alcohol, just work-gym and going for a coffee by myself. No one answers me. 

Am I doing something wrong ? It has been nearly a month and no one responds. I set watchdogs for each district, once the listings are online i copy paste everything in czech and sending them. 100% sure I am the first one to reply but nothing. Example: rent is 14k, deposit 16k. I‚Äôm offering 18k rent + 25k deposit still no one answer. 

I really appreciate any kind of suggestions which might help me. Facebook groups were dead end, lots of scammer and I do not wanna live in shared apartment or with roommate. Just by myself in a studio apartment.

When it comes to picking the perfect holiday destination, Canada often tops the list for travelers seeking a mix of adventure, relaxation, and cultural immersion. From its stunning natural landscapes to vibrant cities and friendly locals, there's something for everyone in this vast country. If you're wondering why choose Canada for your holiday, you're in the right place. In this detailed guide, we'll dive into the top reasons to make Canada your next vacation spot, share practical tips like what to know before renting a car or bike (including that all-important International Driving License), and highlight must-see places along those epic long drives. Whether you're planning a family trip, a romantic getaway, or a solo adventure, Canada delivers experiences that stick with you long after you return home.

Canada's appeal as a holiday destination isn't just hype‚Äîit's backed by its sheer size (the second-largest country in the world) and diversity. Spanning six time zones, it offers everything from icy Arctic tundra to temperate rainforests and bustling metropolises. Plus, with its reputation for safety and inclusivity, it's an ideal choice for first-time international travelers. Let's break down why Canada should be at the top of your holiday wishlist.

# The Breathtaking Natural Beauty That Defines Canada Vacations

One of the biggest draws for a Canada holiday is its unparalleled natural scenery. Imagine waking up to the sight of snow-capped mountains, crystal-clear lakes, and endless forests‚Äî that's everyday life in places like Banff National Park in Alberta. This UNESCO World Heritage site is a haven for nature lovers, with turquoise waters of Lake Louise that look like they've been photoshopped (but they're real!). Hiking trails here range from easy strolls to challenging treks, making it accessible for all fitness levels.

Head east to Niagara Falls in Ontario, where the thundering cascades create a misty spectacle that's even more impressive up close on a boat tour. Or venture to the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve in British Columbia for rugged coastlines, ancient rainforests, and whale-watching opportunities. Canada's national parks system is world-class, with over 40 parks covering diverse ecosystems. For wildlife enthusiasts, spotting moose, bears, or even polar bears in Churchill, Manitoba (the ""Polar Bear Capital of the World""), adds an adventurous twist to your vacation.

What sets Canada apart from other destinations is its commitment to preserving these wonders. Eco-tourism is big here, with guided tours that emphasize sustainability. If you're into photography or just soaking in serenity, a Canada vacation offers postcard-perfect views at every turn, making it a top pick for those seeking a nature-focused holiday.

# Vibrant Cities and Urban Adventures in Canada

While Canada's wilderness steals the show, its cities are equally compelling reasons to choose it for your holiday. Toronto, the largest city, buzzes with energy‚Äîthink multicultural neighborhoods like Kensington Market, where street art and global cuisines collide. Climb the CN Tower for panoramic views, or catch a game at the Rogers Centre if you're a sports fan.

Vancouver on the west coast blends urban sophistication with outdoor access. Stroll through Stanley Park, one of the world's largest urban parks, or hit the Granville Island Public Market for fresh seafood and artisan goods. Montreal in Quebec offers a European flair with its French-speaking culture, historic Old Montreal cobblestone streets, and festivals like the Montreal International Jazz Festival.

Don't overlook smaller gems like Calgary, known for its cowboy heritage and the annual Stampede, or Ottawa, the capital, with its Parliament Hill and Rideau Canal (perfect for ice skating in winter). These cities provide a perfect balance of modern amenities and historical charm, ensuring your Canada holiday isn't all rugged outdoors‚Äîthere's plenty of cosmopolitan fun too.

# Endless Outdoor Activities for Every Season

Canada's four distinct seasons make it a year-round holiday destination. Summer brings hiking, kayaking, and camping in places like the Rocky Mountains. Fall transforms the landscape into a riot of reds and oranges, ideal for leaf-peeping drives in Algonquin Provincial Park.

Winter turns Canada into a snowy playground‚Äîskiing in Whistler, British Columbia, or snowshoeing in Quebec's Laurentians. Spring offers blooming wildflowers and fewer crowds. Adventure seekers can go white-water rafting on the Ottawa River or zip-lining in the Rockies.

For water lovers, the Great Lakes provide boating and fishing, while the Atlantic provinces like Nova Scotia offer coastal hikes along the Cabot Trail. Canada's outdoor scene caters to all, from adrenaline junkies to those preferring gentle walks, making it a versatile choice for active holidays.

# Cultural Diversity and Rich Heritage

Canada's mosaic of cultures is another compelling reason to visit. As a nation built on immigration, it celebrates diversity through festivals, museums, and communities. In Vancouver's Chinatown or Toronto's Little Italy, you'll taste authentic global flavors.

Indigenous cultures add depth‚Äîvisit the Haida Gwaii islands in British Columbia to learn about First Nations art and traditions, or attend a powwow in Saskatchewan. French-Canadian heritage shines in Quebec City, with its fortified walls and chateau-like architecture.

This cultural blend fosters a welcoming atmosphere, where holidays feel inclusive and enriching. It's not just sightseeing; it's connecting with stories that shape the country.

# The Delicious Food Scene on Your Canada Holiday

Foodies rejoice‚ÄîCanada's culinary landscape is as diverse as its people. Poutine (fries with cheese curds and gravy) is a must-try in Quebec, while fresh lobster rolls await in Prince Edward Island. Alberta's beef is legendary, and British Columbia's wineries in the Okanagan Valley rival Napa.

Farm-to-table dining is huge, with markets like Toronto's St. Lawrence offering local cheeses, maple syrup, and craft beers. Vegetarian and vegan options abound, reflecting modern trends. Pair your meals with Canadian wines or ice wines for a true taste of the land.

# Safety, Hospitality, and Ease of Travel

Canada consistently ranks as one of the safest countries globally, with low crime rates and excellent healthcare. The locals' famed politeness‚Äî ""sorry"" is practically a national word‚Äîmakes visitors feel at home.

English and French are official languages, easing communication. Affordable flights from major hubs and efficient public transport add convenience. For families, kid-friendly attractions like zoos and science centers make it ideal.

# Essential Travel Tips: Renting a Car or Bike in Canada

To truly explore Canada's vastness, renting a vehicle is key. But before you rent a car or bike, there are a few things to sort out for a smooth trip.

First off, if you're from outside Canada, get an [International Driving License Canada](https://www.e-itca.org/international-driving-permit-canada) (also known as an International Driving Permit or IDP). This isn't always mandatory, but it's highly recommended as it translates your home license into multiple languages and is required by many rental companies. You can obtain one from your local automobile association before leaving home‚Äîit's quick and inexpensive. Without it, you might face issues at pickup or with authorities.

Check age requirements: Most rentals require drivers to be at least 21 (sometimes 25 for premium vehicles), and young driver fees apply under 25. Insurance is crucial‚Äîopt for comprehensive coverage, as Canadian roads can be remote and weather unpredictable. Fuel up regularly, especially in rural areas where stations are sparse.

For bikes or motorcycles, similar rules apply: Helmet laws are strict, and you'll need that International Driving License too. Consider weather‚Äîsummers are great for riding, but winters demand caution.

Book in advance during peak seasons (June-August) to snag deals. Apps like Turo offer peer-to-peer rentals for a local feel. Always inspect the vehicle and note any damage before driving off.

# Epic Long Drives: Places to Cover on Your Canada Road Trip

Nothing beats a Canadian road trip for freedom and scenery. The Trans-Canada Highway stretches 7,821 km from coast to coast, but here are standout routes and places to cover.

Start with the Icefields Parkway in Alberta‚Äîa 230 km drive from Banff to Jasper National Park. You'll pass glaciers, turquoise lakes like Peyto, and wildlife hotspots. Stop at Columbia Icefield for a glacier walk.

In British Columbia, the Sea-to-Sky Highway from Vancouver to Whistler winds through fjords and mountains. Detour to Squamish for rock climbing or Garibaldi Provincial Park for hikes.

Eastward, the Cabot Trail in Nova Scotia is a 298 km loop around Cape Breton Island. Highlights include Look-Off Mountain for panoramic views, whale-watching in Pleasant Bay, and Celtic music in local pubs.

For a prairie adventure, drive Saskatchewan's Grasslands National Park to Badlands National Park in the U.S., spotting bison and stargazing under dark skies.

In Ontario, the route along Lake Superior's north shore from Thunder Bay to Sault Ste. Marie covers rugged cliffs, beaches, and Agawa Canyon for fall colors.

Pack snacks, download offline maps, and watch for wildlife crossings. These drives aren't just about getting from A to B‚Äîthey're the heart of a memorable Canada holiday.

1mx8hhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCivilService/comments/1mx8hhr/canary_wharf_folks/,Canary Wharf Folks,"Hey all, 

I've just received a provisional offer (wahoo!) and my closest office is Canary Wharf/10 South Colonnade. I'm coming from a barely functioning office elsewhere in London so I'm not expecting big things, but I get anxious about this sort of stuff. I wanted to prepare myself for what to expect and would appreciate it if anyone who has recently worked there is able to give an idea of what it's like working there.

I've tried to find this information through google and searching this page but it's not helping answer my specific questions as follows:¬†

Is there a gym on site?¬†

Is there a cafeteria?¬†

Does everyone get a locker for personal items?

Is the aircon decent or does it yo-yo from mount doom to Alaskan winter?

Are the tea making facilities kettles or hot (tepid) taps in the kitchens?¬†

Are there kitchen hubs with a fridge so I can bring my lunch in?

Are all floors really busy or is it fairly easy to get a desk every day?

Is there lots of natural light in the building?

Presume this depends on the department but what's the general dress code vibe - casual-casual or smart-casual?

If anyone goes to the PureGym nearby, is it alright or is it over subscribed like the rest of their branches?¬†

I know asking about equipment is a sensitive question so if these can't be answered I understand: In general are people given laptops or tablets? Where I worked before I was given a tablet which was much lighter to carry to the office for a neck injury and I could connect to a screen hub, I'm nervous about having to lug a big heavy laptop around every day again. Also can you request a work phone rather than using your personal one? In the office are there screen hubs to connect to or is it just working straight off the laptop/tablet (my biggest fear)?

Lastly, if there's any recommendations on places to eat, get a coffee, things to look out for and where to visit during lunch breaks etc I'd greatly appreciate them. I haven't worked in this part of London before so I don't know the area and would welcome any pointers.

That's a lot of questions sorry, but big thanks in advance to anyone patient enough to answer them!¬†

The **Presto 02811 Stainless Steel Electric Coffee Percolator** was a welcome addition to my caffeine-fueled mornings. As someone who juggles tight schedules but still craves a delightfully brewed coffee, I found this product ticking several of my must-have boxes. With its timeless design, capacity for 12 cups, and efficient brewing speed, it immediately made itself at home on my kitchen countertop. The stainless-steel construction undeniably stands out, exuding an upscale vibe.

**Build and Aesthetic Appeal**

This percolator is truly a stunner. Its polished stainless steel not only adds elegance but feels durable and sturdy to the touch. At 13.1 x 9.7 x 6.2 inches and weighing just under 3 pounds, it‚Äôs compact enough to fit neatly in a cabinet yet hefty enough to assure quality. Plus, cleaning up after a morning brew wasn‚Äôt a chore, as the percolator‚Äôs interior can be easily wiped down‚Äîthough it‚Äôs best to avoid immersing it in water. Attention to detail, such as the easy-pour spout, makes serving coffee more elegant while cutting down on potential spills. Even family members who aren‚Äôt morning people noticed its retro charm!

**Brewing Performance That Delivers**

The brewing process is remarkably user-friendly. Whether preparing just 2 cups for a quiet afternoon or filling the pot for a gathering, the percolator maintains consistent speed and precision‚Äîone minute per cup. I appreciate that it keeps the brewed coffee piping hot once done, saving me trips back to the kitchen for reheating. The inclusion of a signal light is a thoughtful feature, letting me know precisely when my caffeine hit is ready. Everything about the coffee tasted richer and fuller-bodied, which was a step above the flavor typically achieved by modern drip machines.

**[Check Presto 02811 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00006iv0q/)**

**Perks**

- Brews coffee exceptionally rich and flavorful, comparable to high-end caf√© brews.
- The ability to make between 2 to 12 cups is perfect for solo use or group settings.
- Durability inspires confidence, thanks to the high-quality stainless-steel build.
- A removable power cord is great for reducing counter clutter during storage.
  
**Limitations**

- Though the manual's instructions are clear, a digital temperature control could prevent over-extraction risks for first-time users.
- The stainless steel, while beautiful, is prone to fingerprint marks‚Äîconstant wiping keeps it pristine.
  
**User-Friendly Features at a Glance**

A closer look at the percolator‚Äôs design highlighted its thoughtful engineering geared towards coffee enthusiasts. Features like the stainless-steel filter basket and perk tube caught my attention since they promise longevity and are far superior to typical aluminum or plastic alternatives. Plus, the power cord can be detached for easier storage‚Äîa small detail but one that provides convenience. Those who‚Äôve ever faced tangled cords in cramped kitchen drawers will know this feature‚Äôs worth.

**Areas of Concern**

- Cleaning may require a bit of TLC; while the interior is manageable, intricate spots like the perk spout need a brush or pipe cleaner for thorough upkeep.
- No automatic shutoff could make this tricky for individuals who rush out the door in a hurry. I didn‚Äôt forget to turn it off, but I imagine someone else might.

**How it Stands Against Competitive Options**

In the world of coffee-making, this percolator finds itself up against drip makers and pod machines. Compared to drip machines like popular glass caraffe models, the coffee‚Äôs flavor profile here is distinctly richer. Pod machines might offer faster brewing, but they lack the bold taste and eco-friendly appeal of a non-pod system. Electric percolators also bring a touch of nostalgia that‚Äôs missing from their more function-over-form counterparts. One area where it could play catch-up are high-end programmable coffee systems offering app connectivity or versatile brew settings.

Notably, a similarly-priced competing percolator might feature a glass knob showcasing the bubbling brew in action‚Äîan aesthetic touch not present here. However, the durability and overall performance of the Presto stainless steel model more than makeup for minor quirks.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**

Considering all the bells and whistles included, the price feels justifiable, particularly when factoring in durability and the ability to brew robust coffee without repeated use of disposable filters. If you‚Äôre someone who enjoys hosting brunches or simply refuses to compromise on morning rituals, this investment secures the ambiance and flavor of a high-end caf√© in your home.

I have a complicated relationship with exercise. In college, approximately 10,000 years ago, I was a competitive ballroom dancer. I lifted and worked out so I would have stamina and beautiful arms.  That's all over. I haven't lifted since college and even then I was doing it wrong.

I am hypermobile and tend to hurt myself when I work out. I do yoga 2x weekly, walk 4-7 times weekly. But lifting weights or any form of focused EXERCISE exercise gives me the heebie jeebies. I am 4'11"". There is no gym equipment in the world, not even a Peloton bike, that can adjust to fit my tiny body. Gyms smell bad, the music is terrible, the TVs are playing crap... I don't actually know exactly what it is that makes me hate exercising so much. It hurts, it feels bad, it's icky, the music is bad, someone is yelling at you to do stuff... ugh.

At least part of it is that my husband is an absolute fitness fiend. He will do a 60 minute Peloton workout then come downstairs all sweaty and gross and put his feet up on the coffee table. Or he'll go climbing at the climbing gym and then lift weights for an hour and then come home and put his feet up on the coffee table. And he's so fucking perky about it. Get out of my face with your perky exercise fanaticism.

I even hired a personal trainer to come to my house and I hated that so much that I forgot to put the appointments in my calendar and they showed up at my house and I wasn't there. The studio fired me.

Last month I hurt my arm. (I knitted too much, ok? it was a knitting injury). The first appointment I could get with my PT was yesterday. In the intervening month, I fixed my arm by taking a break from knitting and going to craniosacral therapy.

I've been seeing the same PT since 2016. She is amazing, I love her, she healed me of so many problems and issues. A lot of what she does is neurological, and focus on the psychology of injury. Fascinating. So I come in, she asks me what is going on. And she says ""You are not injured. You just need to exercise."" And she spent the next 45 minutes kind of berating me that I need to exercise or things will just keep getting worse. I asked her if she was just going to keep yelling at me, or if she was going to do any work on me. It was honestly incredibly uncomfortable. I have recommended dozens of people to her, my naturopath loves her. I don't know if she was having an off day. But she basically said ""You can come back and I will teach you strengthening exercises, but you don't need PT."" She doesn't mean ""go running."" She means ""Strength train."" Lift shit. Do weight bearing exercise.

And you know what I do not fucking feel like doing as a result of being yelled at?

**2024-02-12 Monday [Morning 09:45 AM]**

**(Normal POV)**

The sky remained heavy and dim after yesterday‚Äôs hard rain. Clouds hung above, their gray edges breaking just enough for thin beams of sunlight to shine through. A large tree stood on the grounds of Shiganshina College, its branches stretching wide and casting cool shade below. Several benches rested under its canopy, offering a quiet spot for students to escape the morning rush.

Jean sat on one of those benches. His posture was still, and his eyes wandered, as if the world around him barely existed. He wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the passing students or the distant sounds of chatter. His mind was somewhere else, fixed on one thought. Or rather, on one person.


**(Jean's POV)**

I sat on a bench beneath the giant tree in the middle of campus. The ground was still damp, and the bench felt cold against my jeans. The air carried the sharp, earthy smell of yesterday‚Äôs rain; it was fresh but also a little depressing.

A couple walked past, fingers interlocked, laughing at something only they could hear. I looked away, but it was too late. My chest tightened, and my mind pulled up the one thing I didn‚Äôt want to think about‚Äîher.

**Mikasa.**

Some people say she likes me. More than a few have said it right to my face. At first, I brushed it off as a joke. But when you hear the same thing repeatedly, you start to wonder. Could it be true? If it is, why hasn‚Äôt she said anything?

I shook my head, annoyed at myself for even going there. Then‚Äî

**‚ÄúJean!‚Äù**

A voice came from behind, making me jump so hard that I nearly swore.

**‚ÄúDamn it! Oh, it‚Äôs you, Marco‚Ä¶‚Äù** I muttered, pressing a hand against my chest. **‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sneak up on me like that. You scared me.‚Äù**

Marco chuckled, clearly unfazed. **‚ÄúRelax, I wasn‚Äôt trying to scare you. But honestly, seeing you jump was worth it.‚Äù**

I rolled my eyes. **‚ÄúYeah, hilarious. So, what do you want?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúNothing really,‚Äù** he said, tilting his head at me. **‚ÄúI just noticed you were staring into space like you were deep in thought. Don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs about Mikasa?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúHuh?! No, no, no. Why would I think about her? I was just‚Ä¶ you know, enjoying the weather. Nice breeze, big tree, peaceful vibe‚Ä¶‚Äù** I rambled.

Marco smirked. **‚ÄúThe fact that you said *‚Äòno‚Äô* three times tells me everything. But hey, not my business. Anyway, we‚Äôre heading to the caf√©. Come if you want.‚Äù**

And just like that, he walked off, leaving me sitting there with my stupid thoughts exposed. Damn it. I can‚Äôt lie to Marco to save my life.

I leaned back against the bench and glanced up at the sky peeking through the branches. The weather was beautiful, sure. But so was her face.

Yeah, I‚Äôll admit it‚ÄîI like Mikasa. No point denying it anymore. But saying it out loud? Not a chance. Not when I‚Äôm supposed to be the *‚Äúcool, popular guy‚Äù* around here. Guys like me don‚Äôt confess‚Äîthey just sit under trees and lie through their teeth.

**(Time skip: Morning 10:13 AM)**

I leaned against the wall in the college caf√©, sipping my lukewarm coffee. The place buzzed with chatter, the sound of chairs scraping, dishes clinking, and laughter echoing through every corner.

That‚Äôs when I saw her.

Mikasa walked in with her friends, her hair a bit damp from the morning air. She seemed more relaxed than usual, smiling softly as she listened to Armin. When she laughed‚Äîsoft and rare‚ÄîI felt a tightness in my chest.

I didn‚Äôt realize I was staring until her eyes met mine.

For a split second, I froze. My fingers clenched around my cup, and I nearly looked away. But before I could, she blushed. Just a light pink across her cheeks‚Äîbut then she smiled.

I almost forgot how to breathe.

I quickly glanced down at my coffee, pretending I hadn‚Äôt been caught. Great, Jean. Real smooth.

At their table, Armin and Annie sat a little apart from the others. Annie wore her usual blank look, while Armin seemed to be trying hard not to make it obvious. Typical. Lovebirds.

I rushed to finish my coffee, ignoring the nervous heat creeping up my neck. That‚Äôs when I saw Mikasa slipping away from the group, heading down the hallway. Probably to the library‚Äîshe spent most of her free time there.

Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe this was my chance.

My heart raced as I followed, my shoes sounding heavier than usual on the tile floor. **‚ÄúHey, Mikasa!‚Äù**

She stopped and turned, her eyes widening slightly when she saw me. **‚ÄúOh. Hey, Jean‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs up?‚Äù**

Her voice had a quiet edge, and she fidgeted with the strap of her bag. She seemed nervous‚Äîand it made me even more anxious.

**‚ÄúUh, nothing, really,‚Äù** I stammered. **‚ÄúJust wondering how you‚Äôve been. We haven‚Äôt talked since Professor Hannes‚Äô assignment, remember?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah, true‚Ä¶‚Äù** she replied softly, glancing down for a moment. **‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt.‚Äù**

For a moment, neither of us said anything. The silence felt heavier than I expected. I couldn‚Äôt tell if she was uncomfortable or just shy.

Then a familiar voice broke through.

**‚ÄúMikasa? What are you doing here? Didn‚Äôt you say you were heading to the library?‚Äù**

Annie. She had appeared quietly, arms crossed, and her sharp eyes darted between us.

Mikasa‚Äôs face turned deeper red. **‚ÄúNo, Annie‚Äîit‚Äôs not what you think. We were just‚Ä¶ talking about that group assignment Professor Hannes gave us.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù** I added quickly, raising my hands slightly. **‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all.‚Äù**

Annie‚Äôs lips curled into a faint smirk, but she didn‚Äôt push further. The look in her eyes said enough.

Then‚Äî*crash!*

A plate slammed onto the floor behind us. The three of us turned at once. Across the caf√©, Floch stood over Armin, his usual smug grin on his face.

Of course. Floch being Floch.


**(Armin‚Äôs POV)**

The caf√© smelled like warm bread and coffee, but I wasn‚Äôt tasting any of it. I watched as Annie slipped out, saying she had something to do. She didn‚Äôt even glance back. I tried to act normal, but my chest felt tight.

Then I spotted Mikasa and Jean standing together near the exit. She told me she was going to the library. So why was she there with Jean? Talking and smiling?

Something about it felt off. She had been acting strange lately. Quiet in ways I couldn‚Äôt understand.

I was still lost in thought when I heard a sharp clang. My plate had hit the floor. I blinked and froze. Floch was right in front of me, grinning like he had been waiting for this moment.

**‚ÄúOops,‚Äù** he said casually, **‚Äúmaybe you shouldn‚Äôt put your stuff where people walk.‚Äù** My stomach sank. He wasn‚Äôt here by accident.

**‚ÄúSay sorry,‚Äù** he demanded, folding his arms like he owned the place.

For a moment, the old me wanted to. Just apologize, keep the peace, let it pass. But then I remembered Annie‚Äôs face when she left, Mikasa‚Äôs suspicious looks, and Eren not being around to pull me out of trouble. If I kept letting people like Floch push me around, nothing would ever change.

I swallowed hard. **‚Äú...No. I‚Äôm not saying sorry, Floch.‚Äù**

His eyes widened for a second before narrowing. A few people nearby gasped. Even Annie, who had come back and was watching from across the room, looked surprised.

**‚ÄúWell, look at this,‚Äù** Floch sneered. **‚ÄúLittle Armin finally grew a backbone. Too bad Eren isn‚Äôt here to bail you out this time.‚Äù**

The words stung, but I stood my ground. I was done being the scared kid.

Before Floch could shove me, someone intervened. **‚ÄúEnough, Floch. You‚Äôre going too far.‚Äù** It was Jean. He stood between us with his arms crossed.

Floch laughed bitterly. **‚ÄúWhat, you‚Äôre protecting him because you think Mikasa likes you? Don‚Äôt make me laugh.‚Äù**

I flinched at the words, but Jean didn‚Äôt. He glared at Floch. **‚ÄúThis has nothing to do with her. Just back off.‚Äù**

Floch‚Äôs smirk twisted. His friends started to move in. I braced myself, my heart hammering, when suddenly a kick landed square on Floch‚Äôs chest, sending him stumbling back.

Reiner loomed over Floch like a wall. **‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of your nonsense.‚Äù** Bertholdt stood behind him, silent but solid. Connie moved closer, looking surprisingly serious.

And then everything went still.

A new voice cut through the room, low and sharp: **‚ÄúOi. Floch.‚Äù**

Every head turned. By the doorway stood a small figure with sharp eyes that could cut glass. It was Levi. Behind him stood the tall, commanding Erwin, with Hange beside them, grinning like she was studying us for an experiment.

The caf√© fell silent. Even Floch went pale for a moment.

**‚ÄúProblem?‚Äù** Levi asked flatly, staring directly at Floch.

**‚ÄúN-no, nothing,‚Äù** Floch muttered, backing up quickly. **‚ÄúWe were just leaving.‚Äù** He grabbed his friends and bolted without another word.

I let out the breath I had been holding, my hands trembling.

The senior trio stepped further inside. The whole room felt smaller now, heavier. Everyone whispered their names like legends.

Hange crouched down in front of me with a curious smile. **‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre the one who stood up to Floch today?‚Äù**

I nodded, still shaky.

**‚ÄúGood,‚Äù** Erwin said simply, his presence filling the space. **‚ÄúPeople like him only push until someone finally pushes back.‚Äù**

Levi didn‚Äôt say anything. He glanced at me, then at Mikasa, then back to me‚Äîas if he was judging something none of us could see.

Then they moved on, their group trailing behind. Just a moment, but enough for the entire caf√© to feel their weight.

I sat there, heart pounding, realizing something important: we weren‚Äôt alone anymore.

**(Few moments later)**

I sat on a bench under a tree, replaying what had happened in the cafeteria. My hands were still a bit shaky, but not from fear this time; it was disbelief. I actually talked back to Floch. Me, Armin Arlert, the quiet one, the bookworm.

It didn‚Äôt even feel like me when I said, **‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say sorry.""** The words just slipped out, and for a moment, I thought my knees might give out‚Ä¶ but they didn‚Äôt.

Then Reiner and Bertholdt stood beside me like a wall. Even Connie, who always jokes around, had his fists clenched like he was ready to fight for me. For once, I didn‚Äôt feel small. I felt like I had people behind me.

I was so lost in my thoughts that I almost jumped when a shadow fell over me. I looked up, and there she was. Annie.

Her cool blue eyes met mine, and for a moment, I forgot how to breathe. She tilted her head slightly, her expression softer than usual.

**‚ÄúYou were awesome, Armin,‚Äù** she said.

**‚ÄúWh-what?‚Äù** I stammered, blinking.

**‚ÄúThe way you stood up to Floch,‚Äù** she explained. **‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even flinch. It was... cool. I like seeing you like that.‚Äù**

I felt heat rise to my face, though her tone wasn‚Äôt teasing. It was genuine, which made my chest feel strangely full. Annie wasn‚Äôt someone who gave out compliments easily. If she said it, she meant it.

**‚ÄúI... I don‚Äôt know how I did it,‚Äù** I admitted quietly. **‚ÄúBut... if it made you proud, then I‚Äôm glad.‚Äù**

She looked away, but I thought I saw the corner of her lips curve up.

For a moment, we just sat there in comfortable silence. Then, gathering courage, I asked, **‚ÄúDo you... have any plans this evening?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù** she said. After a pause, she added, **‚ÄúIf you want, we can hang out.‚Äù**

I smiled, my heart skipping. **‚ÄúI‚Äôd like that.‚Äù**

Before I could say more, a familiar energetic voice interrupted. **‚ÄúArmin! There you are!‚Äù**

I turned to see Hange approaching with her usual wide grin, waving like we were old friends.

**‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôs it going? Did Floch mess with you again?‚Äù** she asked, almost scolding. **‚ÄúIf he tries, just tell us. Levi‚Äôs boys will handle him.‚Äù**

I shook my head quickly. **‚ÄúNo, no... he hasn‚Äôt. Probably too scared after what happened.‚Äù**

Hange laughed. **‚ÄúGood. That brat needs to learn his place.‚Äù** Then her gaze shifted to Annie. **‚ÄúAnd who‚Äôs this?‚Äù**

I hesitated only a second before replying, **‚ÄúOh, this is Annie. My... girlfriend.‚Äù**

Annie raised an eyebrow but didn‚Äôt deny it. Hange‚Äôs grin widened.

**‚ÄúWell, now it makes sense why Floch‚Äôs been acting like a jealous idiot,‚Äù** she said. **‚ÄúYou picked a strong one, Armin. Nice.‚Äù**

Before I could respond, she stretched her arms. **‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôve got work to do. Catch you later!‚Äù** She dashed off as quickly as she arrived.

I turned back to Annie, still a little dazed. **‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôre looking out for me,‚Äù** I admitted.

Annie simply shrugged, then slipped her hand into mine as if it was the most natural thing in the world. **‚ÄúMaybe you don‚Äôt need to understand it right now,‚Äù** she said softly.

Her hand was warm. And in that moment, I didn‚Äôt care about Floch, or Levi, or anything else.


**(Time skip: Evening 06:15 PM)**

**(Mikasa‚Äôs POV)**

I finally arrived at my apartment after another long, dull day of classes. The outside air was cool and still held the freshness from yesterday‚Äôs rain. For a moment, I wished I could stay out there instead of being stuck inside these walls again.

As I walked down the hallway, I paused in front of the door to my left. Eren‚Äôs room.

I hadn‚Äôt seen him at college today. Maybe he skipped again, or maybe he was really inside. My hand hovered in the air, my chest tightened. Should I tell him the truth? Or should I hide it like always?

Thoughts battled in my mind. Yes. No. Yes. No.

Finally, I got the courage to knock. Once. Twice. Three times.

Silence.

No answer.

I let out a shaky breath and lowered my hand. Not now then. Maybe later. I told myself that, even though I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would ever find the strength again.

I turned away and went into my room, closing the door behind me.

Alone.

After freshening up, I sat down in the chair by my desk. My phone lay there with its black screen staring back at me. And suddenly, I remembered.

Him.

That unknown person. The one who told me to share my pain with someone. My fingers brushed over the phone as my chest tightened again. Should I? Should I really tell him?

No. He‚Äôs just a stranger. Why would I tell him?

But before I could stop myself, I unlocked the phone and opened the chat. My fingers moved on their own.

**Me [06:52 PM]:** *Hey‚Ä¶ Mr. Unknown.*

For a while, there was nothing. My stomach twisted with regret. Then the screen lit up.

**Unknown [07:01 PM]:** *Hey. Glad you texted. How are you?*

**Me [07:02 PM]:** *‚Ä¶You were right.*

**Unknown [07:04 PM]:** *About what?*

**Me [07:05 PM]:** *About what you said yesterday. Sharing things. Talking about‚Ä¶ pain.*

**Unknown [07:06 PM]:** *I get it. But listen, I'm not here to push you. If you want to tell me, you can. If you don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs okay too.*

**Me [07:07 PM]:** *‚Ä¶I‚Äôll think about it.*

**Unknown [07:08 PM]:** *Take your time. No rush.*

I stared at the screen long after his last message, my throat tightening. My reflection stared back at me faintly through the dark glass of the phone, and only then did I realize‚Äîmy eyes were wet.

Tears.

Why am I crying?

I pressed the heel of my palm against my eyes, but the tears kept coming. Yesterday‚Äôs conversation with Eren had stirred everything I‚Äôve tried to hide. And now the nightmares‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even close my eyes without seeing my parents‚Äô accident again. Without hearing the screams. Without feeling the crushing guilt that I played a part in his parents‚Äô death too.

It‚Äôs unbearable.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.

But at least I wrote something. At least someone replied.

Maybe that‚Äôs enough for now. Maybe this is the start of something. Or maybe it‚Äôs nothing.

I guess I‚Äôll leave it to fate.

Here‚Äôs how trays and platters can be used effectively:

Serving with Style: A well-chosen platter elevates presentation, whether it‚Äôs cheese, desserts, or a full festive spread. The right piece can turn a simple snack into an eye-catching display.

Everyday Functionality: Trays make daily tasks easier, like carrying drinks, organizing breakfast-in-bed setups, or keeping essentials together on a coffee table.

D√©cor Accent: Beyond dining, trays can act as styling bases for candles, planters, or decorative accents, creating a more organized and intentional look.

Material & Design Matters: Wooden trays bring warmth, metal trays add a modern edge, while ceramic platters provide elegance for special occasions.

Space Savers: In compact homes, platters double up as both serving dishes and display items, reducing clutter while still adding character.

Tips to choose the right tray or platter:

Keep at least one large platter for gatherings and a few smaller ones for everyday use.

Neutral tones work well for flexibility, but patterned or textured designs can become conversation starters.

Flat platters are great for appetizers and desserts, while deep trays are practical for drinks or breakfast setups.

Trays and platters may seem secondary, but they‚Äôre actually key in blending functionality with style, both in dining and home d√©cor.",1,1755873599.0,u_vaaree_home_decor_,0,1.0,False

**The receipts, quick and clear:**

None of these looked obvious at seed. They were called niche or risky until the metrics made that impossible.

**What this unlocks for people in this sub**

* **Hiring gravity you can feel:** alumni from these companies are forming new teams in AI tooling, data infra, autonomy, fintech rails, and consumer tech. More roles where your skills actually fit.
* **Vendor openness:** big orgs are refreshing AI, data, and security stacks. A credible Muslim-led product with references is getting a real look.
* **Integration surface area:** Replit, Databricks, and the rest now have ecosystems. That means docs, templates, plugins, and partner slots where independent builders can ship.

**Why the ‚Äúnext stage‚Äù is closer than it looks**

* **Grassroots demand is now distribution, not just vibe.** Yemeni coffee chains moved from curiosity to national pull. Qahwah House went from a single Dearborn shop in 2017 to roughly 25 U.S. locations by mid-2025. That kind of footprint forces real tech needs: ordering, loyalty, forecasting, payments, and ops dashboards. Halal fast food brands are standard across 18 U.S. states and abroad. Stadiums, campuses, and malls mean vendor onboarding, compliance, analytics, and POS integrations. Modest fashion sits inside a global market projected near **$428B by 2027**, with operators like Modanisa in the tens of millions of online sales and U.S. labels scaling. Cross-border checkout, returns, and logistics become software problems. Translation: consumer growth is creating back-end work for engineers, designers, SREs, and data folks right now.

1mx89d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyTabPOS/comments/1mx89d7/common_questions_pos/,Common Questions P.O.S.,"# Blog Post: How Do Point of Sale Systems Handle Inventory Management?

Running a small business, whether it‚Äôs a bustling restaurant or a quaint retail store, you‚Äôve likely wondered, ""How do Point of Sale (POS) systems handle inventory management?"" This is a common concern among business owners looking to streamline operations and ensure they have the right products available for customers without constant manual tracking.

## Why Inventory Management is Essential for Small Businesses

Inventory management is a crucial aspect of running any small business. Without an efficient system in place, you risk running out of stock, over-ordering, or missing out on sales opportunities due to lack of product availability. A robust POS system can put these worries to rest by automating much of the inventory tracking process.

## How POS Systems Manage Inventory

A modern POS system does more than just process sales; it also keeps a real-time count of your inventory. Here's a more detailed breakdown of how it works:

### Real-Time Tracking

Every time an item is sold, returned, or received into stock, the POS system updates your inventory levels instantly. This real-time tracking ensures you always know exactly how much stock you have on hand. For example, in a busy caf√©, when a barista sells a latte, the used coffee beans and milk are deducted from the inventory, letting you know when it's time to reorder.

### Automated Reordering

POS systems can be set up to alert you when stock levels fall below a predefined threshold. Some advanced systems even place orders automatically with your suppliers when inventory is low. Imagine you're a boutique owner; once your best-selling t-shirt stock falls below five units, your POS can automatically send a replenishment order to your supplier, ensuring you never run out.

### Detailed Reporting

POS systems offer comprehensive reports that provide insights into your inventory turnover, helping you identify which items are selling fast and which are not. This can be particularly useful for seasonal businesses like an ice cream parlor that needs to adjust inventory based on the time of year.

### Integration with Accounting Software

Many POS systems integrate seamlessly with accounting software, ensuring that your inventory data aligns with your financial records. This simplifies the bookkeeping process and makes it easier to manage your business finances.

## Scenario Example: The Daily Operations View

Let's walk through how inventory management might look in daily operation at a small retail store. Imagine you own a small bookstore:

- **Morning Check**: You check the inventory report on your POS system, which shows you‚Äôre running low on a popular new release.
- **Automated Alerts**: Your system has already sent an order to your supplier for more copies since it fell below your set threshold last night.
- **Sales Monitoring**: Throughout the day, as each book is sold, your POS system deducts it from your inventory.
- **End-of-Day Review**: At the end of the day, you review the sales and inventory reports, planning for any immediate restocking needs.

This automated and integrated approach saves you valuable time

Have you ever seen those ads or TikToks promising you‚Äôll ""get paid to click CAPTCHAS""‚ÅâÔ∏è

I can‚Äôt be the only one who‚Äôs been weirdly obsessed with this. Like---where is the free money hiding?? Well, let me spill the truth after actually trying a TON of these so-called ""app testing gateways."" Buckle up, it‚Äôs WILD.

- Imagine being told all you need to do is solve some captchas, click buttons and voil√†, cash drops in your wallet.
- This is the exact pitch I kept seeing from sites like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- These ‚Äújobs‚Äù claim actual payouts for being a human. Who knew my lack of bot skills would pay rent?

But here‚Äôs where it gets WEIRD. The truth about app testing gateways is basically a rollercoaster of *surprise, confusion,* and a little bit of that ‚ÄúAm I being played?‚Äù feeling. Here‚Äôs what I foundüëá

üß© **Shocking Truths I Learned FIRSTHAND:**

- **It‚Äôs NOT a scam... technically.** Some of these ARE real (like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**), but the payouts are nowhere NEAR what those viral videos claim.
- **The rewards?** I made maybe 25 cents for half an hour---so, that $500 per day fantasy? Byeeee.
- You complete ‚Äútests‚Äù, so you get points or pennies (if you‚Äôre lucky). Sometimes you have to use the test apps WAY longer or refer people to hit payout thresholds!
- *Multiple sites redirect through the exact same testing gateway*, way more often than you think. So you‚Äôll see **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and think you‚Äôre getting another shot, but it‚Äôs all connected.

üò≤ Things got confusing when I realized the SAME captchas came back over and over.

Emotional whiplash.

ü§ñ **App Testing Gateways: Real Money or Real Time-Waster?**

- If you‚Äôre imagining earning passive income from CAPTCHA clicks...RETHINK. It‚Äôs barely coffee money per week.
- The real winners? The people RUNNING these gateways. They collect data, get referral bonuses, AND your attention.
- But some people swear by it for tiny rewards (again: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is everywhere, in case you‚Äôre curious/brave).

üí° **TL;DR:**

- Yes, you can ""get paid to test apps"" or ""get paid for captchas."" You just won‚Äôt make more than loose change, and your patience WILL be tested.
- Best pro-tip if you dive in? Only use **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** on a burner email!

Why is this such a rabbit hole? What are we even testing for?! Is anyone here banking real money or just investing hours into endless CAPTCHAS?

Seriously, has anyone here broken past the pennies barrier with these ‚Äútest‚Äù platforms? Share your stories ‚Äì or battle scars! üòÇ

I‚Äôm honestly still shocked at how spread out and *connected* all these sites are...if you‚Äôve cracked the code, DO TELL.

Oh, and if you still want to roll the dice: *it all circles back to* **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. The gateway to *basically* every captcha promise.

That's it, so just happening to bump into someone on, say, Sainsbury's, wouldn't be on the cards. He's also buggered his back so he can't walk far, and as far as I know (and he's in his 50s) he's never had sex, never had the desire to have sex or be intimate in any way, and has never had, or been interested in, a girlfriend. He even says he's asexual. He's not gay either. In terms of looking online, what would he even look for, description wise? A ""female companion""? I suspect that term would have too many hits on prostitutes. Is there a group name for somebody like him / somebody like that? And yeah I know ""just a friend who's a girl"" is what I'm thinking but maybe he's hoping it'll lead to something of an understanding, some closer companionship. Any suggestions would be welcome!

The fact that people are so cold, that they genuinely think a delicious coffee of one is worth the suffering of billions of creatures, and they are all surprised how we don't find it fairly balanced.

Big thanks to everyone in this movement. 
I find you all to be the purest and the smartest in this cruel world.

The fact is, people need to view an ideology to be somehow attractive/trendy/pleasurable to  partake, and this is sadly not the case here currently.

Also, I think us that are aware of the awful nature of the world we're living in, we need more mutual support rather than constant graphic reminders of how cruel everything around us is.

Halfway there I came across a wolf and some rabbits, and picked up pelts right there and then. Then a blizzard suddenly hit. I tried making my way to the hunting cabin, but found myself at the tunnel entrance to Forlorn Muskeg. I took advantage of the shelter to set up a campfire. After fully warming myself up and drinking some coffee I began heading west for the hunting lodge.

I could have sworn on my soul that I was headed straight west the entire time, always using the cliff face as my guide. And yet it became clear that I should have reached the cabin ages ago. Another fire kept me alive for a while, and I trudged on. I only survived due to the weather dying down before I did, and then I brought out some charcoal and use map surveying to determine where I was.

Our family was small.¬† Me, my baby brother, and our mom.¬† All of our hair was pretty short.¬† Theirs was red and mine was light brown, so I knew the hair didn‚Äôt come from any of us.



‚ÄúMom..??‚Äù¬† I held up the hair to show her.¬† She looked away from my younger brother as she was feeding him in his highchair and inspected what I was holding, her mouth twisting in disgust.



‚ÄúOh buddy, what in the world‚Ä¶?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hair, how the heck did it get in there?‚Äù¬† I kept holding it.¬† I was really grossed out but I didn‚Äôt want it to touch the table.¬† Mom pushed her thick, round glasses up her nose to get a closer look.



‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ it must be one of my embroidery threads, that‚Äôs the only thing that would make sense.¬† Or it could be from one of the former residents.¬† I‚Äôm just so sorry it ended up in your food, bud...‚Äù¬† She gingerly took it from me.¬† It was wet and cold now, and made my skin shiver as she pulled it away from my hands to throw it in the green plastic garbage bin next to the kitchen counter.



We finished dinner, but I couldn‚Äôt stomach that much more.¬† I helped mom clean up as the sound of coughing upstairs, busy cars outside, and my little brother playing with his toys kept us company.¬† By the time we were finished with the dishes, I‚Äôd forgotten about the hair.



I brushed my teeth in the tiny, yellow-tiled bathroom while Mom washed Matty off in the tub.¬† I looked in the mirror, making sure I got my back teeth, as the warm bath made it fog over.



‚ÄúBen, can you watch him for me while I get a towel?‚Äù



‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù I replied through toothpaste foam.



She left the room and I bent down to spit, Matty giggling and splashing next to me.¬† When I lifted my head up to inspect my face in the misty glass, I saw Mom was back, standing behind me.¬† I grinned for a split second, before noticing how tall she was.¬† My eyes drifted up the mirror.¬† Her hair was so long.



Mom snapped me back to reality, coming back into the bathroom with a towel.¬† I splashed my face in the sink and rubbed my eyes.



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that, you‚Äôll get an astigmatism,‚Äù my mom snapped at me, lifting my brother out of the bath and drying him off.



I finished up and crawled into bed.¬† Mom set Matty in his crib right next to me.¬† I had this habit of not going to sleep until he did.¬† One time I fell asleep and he climbed up the crib bars and fell out.¬† My mom had to rush in to get him because I was dead asleep, didn‚Äôt hear him crying.¬† I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt wake up.¬†



I got chewed out and I‚Äôd been scared of something like that happening ever since.¬† So I waited until his quiet burbling turned into sleepy, tiny snores, and then shut my eyes, drifting off to the sound of his soft breath.



I had a dream about being a caterpillar.¬† I was still me, still looked like me, but I was sort of ‚Äúworm-shaped‚Äù at the same time, almost like a grub. It‚Äôs that kind of dream logic where you keep going back and forth between being two different things, flashing from one perspective to another, like first person one second and third person another.¬† Except you‚Äôre also both things and seeing both perspectives at the same time.¬†¬†



Anyway, I was me and I was a caterpillar, and I was climbing a tree.¬† It was hard because I was so heavy and round, and my many arms were short and stubby, like a baby's, except with more joints.¬† I clung to the bark with fleshy, fat appendages and after what felt like hours I finally reached the first branch, heaving with a sense of accomplishment.¬† I hung upside down from my legs, and could feel the blood rush to my head.¬† I then opened my mouth wide, too wide, which hurt my jaw.¬† I took my two front arms and reached inside my gaping maw. My hands brushed across my teeth, slid over my tongue, and down the entrance of my throat.¬† I felt my gag reflex activate, and with no control over myself, I grabbed what was inside and slowly began pulling it out, inch by inch.¬† My eyes stung with tears as they bubbled up and ran down across my forehead, but I couldn‚Äôt stop myself.¬† It felt like my nature.¬† I couldn‚Äôt fight it.



I pulled the thick, black strands of hair out of my throat, and as I did, my other limbs grabbed it and began meticulously wrapping it around my body.¬† Around and around and around‚Ä¶¬† It was covered in cold saliva, which helped it cling to my naked, wormy flesh, like hair on a shower wall.¬† Weaving layer after layer after layer‚Ä¶ The ritual was complete once I was utterly engulfed in hair, blocking out all sounds, smells, elements‚Ä¶ There was complete darkness.¬† The only thing I could sense was the feeling of being surrounded by softness, warmed by my body heat, which made me question whether I was still asleep or awake, snuggled up in the blankets of my room.¬†¬†



I felt two hands, then four, reach in through the hair and start caressing my body.¬†¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôm still dreaming,‚Äù I thought to myself.¬† Maybe this was the feeling of being changed into a butterfly; the hands of some unseen creator shaping me into something beautiful.



The hands tugged at my clothes and started pulling my hair hard.¬† Not with the benevolent intention to change, but the desire to take.



‚ÄúMmph..oww..‚Äù I murmured.¬† I could hear my own voice, could feel the warmth of it traveling up my throat and escaping my lips.¬† As soon as I made a sound, the hands shot off me and there was a rapid trill of footsteps, startling me awake.¬† I sat up just in time to see a flash of white leave my room.¬†¬†



I sat in silence for a few seconds, clutching my heart as it hammered at my ribcage.¬† My eyes flicked toward Matty, who was sitting up and staring at the bedroom door, sucking on his fingers. I rubbed my eyes, looking up again.¬† The door was still slowly swinging from being opened.¬† I swung my legs over the side of my bed and silently walked to the chest in the corner of my room, grabbing a wooden bat and flashlight.



I looked at the dutifully ticking clock in the kitchen.¬† It was around 2:30.¬† It was storming outside, and I groaned in my head.¬† This cheap apartment building had tiny hidden entry points, and for some reason, when it rained, the floor became damp, and snails got in.¬† You had to watch where you stepped.¬†¬†



I searched the cabinets in the kitchen first; under the sink and even the ones over the counter.¬† I scanned the flashlight over the living room, slowly stepping onto the dirty brown carpet.¬† I made my way to our yellow couch, looking around and behind it.¬† I nearly gave myself a heart attack when I turned around and the glare of the flashlight looked back at me in the screen of our small tv.¬† I laughed softly at myself and lowered the light, but instead of one figure in the reflection of the black, rounded screen, there were two.¬† One of them wore a white, thin night gown, and was standing on the couch.¬† She was very tall.¬† She had long, unkempt hair.



I spun around frantically and took a step back, wincing as my bare foot landed on a thin shell that gave way to slimy, squishy flesh.¬† I heard a shrill scream and my disoriented brain told me it came from the poor snail, but when the lights flickered on, my eyes were brought to the pink roller and bathrobe-clad woman in the living room entryway.



‚ÄúBenjamin Michael Hartley, what the jeezums are you doing up at this hour??‚Äù Mom whispered shrilly, rubbing her temple.¬† ‚ÄúI thought somebody broke in, you scared me to death!‚Äù



I looked back at the couch.¬† No one was there.



‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶‚Äù¬† My voice cracked a bit.¬† I swallowed hard and lifted my foot, shell and slime and organs ascending with it.¬† I looked down and noticed black hair attached and mixed in with the carnage, dangling from my foot.¬† ‚ÄúMom, were you the person in our room a second ago‚Ä¶?‚Äù



Her brows furrowed and her eyes widened.¬† Matty started crying.¬† Mom glanced back and forth between me and our room hesitantly before going to pick up my brother.



While holding him against her chest, we both checked over the apartment again.¬† It was easier and much less scary with the lights on, but the storm still cast shadows over the windows that kept me on edge.¬† Every once in a while the search was interrupted by a sickening squelch as another snail met its untimely demise in the haste of our mission.¬† No one was there.¬† Mom checked the locks on the door and made sure all of the windows were shut.



We all tried to sleep in Mom‚Äôs bed.¬† I think Matty was the only one who was able to throughout the night.¬† I was able to drift off for a bit after the sun began to rise.¬†¬†



By the time I woke up, Mom was in the kitchen holding our telephone, twisting the teal curly-chord anxiously.¬† At one point her fingers got caught in it and she angrily flung it off her hand as she spoke in hushed tones to whoever was on the other end.¬† I silently watched, trying in vain to piece together the conversation.



Finally she set the phone down on the receiver and walked over to me.¬†



‚ÄúWas‚Ä¶ was that the police..?‚Äù I whispered gravely.



My mom let out a breathy laugh and rustled my hair, the details of her sleep deprived eyes magnified by the spectacles.¬†¬†



‚ÄúNo, bud, just the landlord.¬† I asked him to come up and check things out.¬† I want to ask him about past residents, too.‚Äù



I looked around anxiously.¬† ‚ÄúDid he look at the security cameras?‚Äù



Mom smirked and nodded.¬† ‚ÄúOh yeah. At least the ones that work. Nothin‚Äô. I doubt he‚Äôs able to actually see anything helpful on those boxes of junk anyway though.‚Äù



She must‚Äôve seen how unnerved I still was so she pulled me into a tight hug.¬† ‚ÄúHopefully it was just a bad dream, baby. Nothing more. Like the ones you got when you were younger.‚Äù



She went to the bathroom to take out her curlers while I sat in the middle of the sofa and waited for Rodney to climb the stairs to our apartment.¬†¬†



My eyes wandered to the tv.¬† Only my reflection stared back.¬† The dull colors of the living room became duller still in the black glass.¬† I grabbed the remote next to me without looking at it and flipped it on, switching the few channels we got until I reached colorful static.¬† Hissing and singing and dancing across the once black screen.¬† My brows furrowed as I noticed my reflection still there.¬† One with the screen.¬† One with the static.¬† My figure bathed in color and black lines.¬† A snail slowly dragged its body across my reflection‚Äôs face.



I was awoken from my stupor by ‚Äúshave-and-a-haircut‚Äù being rapped on the door.¬† I flipped the tv off and let Rod in.



‚ÄúBenjiiii, ‚Äòeeeeey‚Ä¶!‚Äù The greasy, fat man pulled me under his arm and gave me a noogie. He smelled like tobacco and whiskey. ¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this I hear about home intrusion? Don‚Äôtchu worry yo‚Äô pretty little head, Benj, I gotchu and your Mamma covered.¬† Ain‚Äôt nothin‚Äô comin‚Äô in ‚Äòere without ol‚Äô Rod‚Äôs big fat say-so.‚Äù¬† He winked and pointed two sausage thumbs at himself before tromping through the apartment, checking the door locks and windows by essentially shaking and hitting them.¬† I fixed my hair and followed him silently.¬† One thing I liked about Rodney was that I didn‚Äôt have to talk much when he was here.



Mom walked out of the bathroom to welcome him, red ringlets now framing her thin face.



‚ÄúThere she iiiis‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòPrima Donna‚Äô herself.‚Äù¬† He walked up to my mom and took her small hands into his big ones, holding them reassuringly.



Mom got him a cup of coffee and they talked a while on the couch about everything going on.



‚ÄúWell now that yous mention it, there was a lady here before you guys.‚Äù He scratched his beard and squeezed his coffee mug while thinking.¬† ‚ÄúWudn‚Äôt the‚Ä¶ sociable type.¬† Very pretty, though, very pretty‚Ä¶‚Äù



I pretended to clean dishes while listening in on the conversation.¬† Watching the clouds, admiring Mom‚Äôs plants on the windowsill‚Ä¶



Mom leaned in closer to him, clutching her robe and speaking in a hushed tone as if I couldn‚Äôt hear from three feet away.¬† ‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ did she have long, black hair‚Ä¶?‚Äù



‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶? No, no actually.¬† Chick had blonde hair, almost white.¬† Very short, kinda chubby.¬† Cute, like a little chipmunk.‚Äù¬† He chuckled a bit before his laugh faded out into a serious sigh.¬† ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ she died.‚Äù



‚ÄúD-Died? How?‚Äù my mom gasped.



‚ÄúWell, ‚Äòdissapeared‚Äô, if yous wanna get into the techno-calities‚Ä¶ happened overnight.¬† Never even saw her leave the buildin‚Äô.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúMy word‚Ä¶why do you suspect she died?‚Äù



Rodney leaned back into the couch, digging into his pocket.



‚ÄúWell, ‚Äòcause she left this behind.¬† She always wore it.¬† Never woulda left anywhere without it.‚Äù



I peeked over to the living room at what he was holding.¬† It was a snail shell broach.



‚ÄúOf course I wudn‚Äôt gonna be the one to fight the po-lice on they‚Äôs findings, could hurt business and all that‚Ä¶ but yeah, she loved these slimy bastards.‚Äù¬† He twirled the pendant around in his meaty fingers.¬† ‚ÄúKept ‚Äòem as friggin' pets.¬† You know, I think‚Ä¶‚Äù he leaned forward again, ‚Äú... she‚Äôs the one that let these damned things into the complex.¬† Dug out holes, somewhere nobody could find.¬† That way she could catch ‚Äòem more easily or some crap like that‚Ä¶‚Äù



Mom let out an exasperated sigh.¬† ‚ÄúWas there *anybody* who lived here before us with long black hair?¬† There has to be some explanation for it.¬† It‚Äôs all around the apartment.‚Äù



‚ÄúNot that I can think of off the top of my nog, but lotsa people been through this here building.¬† A lotta girls, a lotta guys, a lotta guys who brought in a lotta girls, yada yada, I try not to stick my schnoz too deep in another man‚Äôs beehive if you know what I mean‚Ä¶‚Äù



My mom thanked him after they searched the apartment one more time, and I stared at a plant in the middle of the windowsill.¬† It was a pale green, with strangely thin, sporadic leaves that reached up and cork-screwed in all directions.¬† I didn‚Äôt like to look at it.¬† I reached up, twirled one of the leaves around my finger.



‚ÄúWell Benj, Donna‚Ä¶‚Äù Rodney shot two finger-guns at us.¬† ‚ÄúYous take care.¬† Don‚Äôt be scared to call up ol‚Äô Rod if that nightmare lady comes back a-knockin‚Äô.¬† I‚Äôve always had a thing for tall chicks.‚Äù¬† He let out a raspy laugh until he coughed, squeezing our shoulders good-naturedly before leaving us.



Mom replaced the chain lock with a \*shink\* and pushed in the rest of the latches.



‚ÄúYou feel any better, bud?‚Äù she asked, rubbing my back.



‚ÄúHonestly, not really,‚Äù I chuckled nervously.



She scrunched her face.¬† ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ me neither.¬† Let‚Äôs eat breakfast.‚Äù



Mom called in sick and we had a really chill summer day at home.¬† We found a channel with cartoons and Matty tried to imitate the characters‚Äô over-dramatic voices and expressions while Mom peacefully worked on her embroidery.



When I was younger, I watched a cartoon with a monster in it.¬† I can‚Äôt remember what it was called, something with knights and dragons and princesses, etc‚Ä¶ One episode scared me so bad, that I had a nightmare.¬†¬†



I was me, and I was a knight.¬† I had to get to the princess, to save her.¬† So I climbed all the way up a large, stone tower.¬† It didn‚Äôt have a door, only a window at the very top.¬† So I pain-stakingly grabbed hold of bricks and stones until I reached the opening, clambering inside.¬† But the princess wasn‚Äôt there.¬† The room was empty except for a big cellar door in the middle.¬† It was red, or maybe blue‚Ä¶ The color of it changes every time I try to recall it.¬† But no matter what the color was, I knew that I had to go inside.¬† The princess was down there.



Have you ever had a really cool dream turn into a nightmare?



‚ÄúRAWR!‚Äù¬† Matty was scrunching his nose and opening his eyes wide, slapping my legs as he did the best impression of the cartoon‚Äôs villain he possibly could.¬† He put his heart and soul into it.



‚ÄúAhh! Oh nooo!‚Äù I started tickling him.¬† ‚ÄúThe monster‚Äôs gonna eat uuuus! Ahhhh! We have to fight back!‚Äù¬† He laughed until he ran out of breath as I poked him in the ribs.



As the day went on, spirits rose.¬† We watched tv, listened to music, ate a hairless dinner, and went to bed.



I waited for Matty to fall asleep. I sat up in bed for a few minutes longer, listening to the rain and watching a snail crawl up the wall, only to be met with the ceiling blocking his way to the sky.



I laid back down and let my eyes close.¬† To my surprise, I was back in that dream I had as a kid.¬† Standing at that cellar door.¬† I realized why I could never remember the color; it was constantly shifting.¬† Pixels of color moving and changing, hurting my eyes and yet drawing me in.



I was me, so I knew what would happen if I went down there, but I was also the knight, and I had to save the princess.¬† I was older now, and stronger, maybe things would go differently this time.



I swung open the door.



I took a step down the long, winding staircase.¬† It was dark, and damp, and cold.¬† Black, wet vines hung from the ceiling and hit my head and back as I descended.¬† Around and around and around.¬† Down into the swirling darkness.¬† The growth grew thick and I had to begin cutting at it with my sword.¬† At one point it got tangled up in the vines.¬† I pulled and pulled but couldn‚Äôt get it out.¬† I left it and began working at the vines with my teeth.¬† Tearing at them like an animal, obsessed with moving forward.¬† They were so thin and greasy, and they smelled horrible.¬† I could feel them getting caught in my throat and in between my teeth like floss, digging into my gums and making them bleed.¬†¬†



I pushed forward and down.¬† Somehow the darkness grew darker in the tangle of these curly masses.¬† My foot tripped over one of the vines and lost traction with the ground, and my body hurled itself down the center of the staircase, straight into the abyss.¬†¬†



The vines caught me right before I hit the bottom, strangling against my neck and popping a few of my joints out of socket from the force of falling.¬† I gagged and groaned and struggled futilely in the black restraints as I hung upside down, blood rushing to my head.¬† I craned my neck side to side.



‚ÄúP-princess..?‚Äù I wheezed out desperately.¬† I heard my weak voice echo.¬† The base of the tower wasn‚Äôt large.¬† I knew that anyone who was down there with me would be very close by.



‚ÄúPrincess!‚Äù I forced out a shout.¬† The echo bounced off the walls violently, making me jump.¬†¬†



I heard a very quick, wet drum of footsteps.¬† I yanked my head in the direction of the sound, but blackness shrouded everything.



I swung in a circle, somehow encapsulating myself even more in the vines.¬† I swung to look behind me, there was nothing.¬† But when I came back around, I could make out a vague shape in the shadows, hunched down on all limbs.¬† Each time I made a revolution, she was closer.¬† White nightgown, limbs long and lanky and pale.¬† Her entire face gone and replaced by what looked like a giant, twisted pucker.¬† He black hair was up in all directions, sticking to herself, the ground, the walls‚Ä¶



I ferociously began biting at the hair encasing me to no avail.¬† I swung back around and her horrible face was right up to mine.¬† It stunk.¬† A putrid mix of what smelled like body odor, old milk, and spoiled meat.¬† She brought up her four bony, white hands to hold me in place. I thrashed and whimpered and bit at the air.¬†¬†



An awful squelching noise pierced my senses as her meaty face opened up like a camera shutter, welcoming the sight of a large, unblinking, otherworldly eye in the center.¬† I stopped moving, transfixed by her iris, shifting colors at an impossible pace, blending together and yet remaining separate.¬† There was so much love in that eye.¬† So much compassion.¬† Without a word she told me I didn‚Äôt need to be strong anymore.¬† She told me that everything that was and will be and could be worked in unity to bring us together in that moment.¬† Princess, monster, friend, enemy, goddess, Devil, all at the same time.¬† I didn‚Äôt have to be the knight and I didn‚Äôt have to be me.¬† I was allowed to be nothing.¬† I wanted to be nothing.¬† I wanted to give all of myself to her.¬†



Her long, spidery eyelashes slowly grew and reached toward me, pulling me closer to her beautiful, heavenly eye.¬† I felt them wrap around my ears and neck and braid themself into my hair.



She was her, and I would be her, all at the same time.



I woke up to my mom shaking me awake.¬† I could hear Matty crying in her other arm.¬† It must‚Äôve happened again.



Instead of the disappointed, scowling look I was expecting, Mom looked concerned.¬† She was feeling my neck and my wrists, and I flinched in pain.¬† I looked at Matty, who was crying and reaching for me pitifully.



My mom pulled black strands away from my bruised skin and the worry on her face turned to determination.



I sat on the couch with a mug of hot chocolate my mom made for me, watching the white milk swirl into the brown brew,¬† while she was on the phone.¬† It was still storming outside.¬† I couldn‚Äôt remember a time it rained for so long.¬† I heard my mom swear and I looked over at her.



‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get ahold of him or the police, storm must be messing with the phones or something‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going downstairs.‚Äù¬† She wrapped the robe around herself tighter and went to her room.



‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôll be alone! And what if she‚Äôs still in the apartment??‚Äù I protested, standing up, causing me to spill a bit of my hot chocolate.



She came out of her room brandishing a small revolver, holding it up to show me before placing it in her robe pocket.¬†¬†



‚ÄúYou can keep your bat ready, but there is NO one in the apartment right now.¬† We checked everywhere.¬† The crazy bitch must‚Äôve snuck back out‚Ä¶ Somehow she‚Äôs getting through our locks and I need to talk to Rod about it now just in case she‚Äôs still in the building.¬† We can‚Äôt let her hurt anybody else.¬† There‚Äôs a lot of elderly people here.¬† The last thing they need is some crackheaded pervert breaking into their rooms.‚Äù¬†¬†



She came up to me and kissed the top of my head before looking me in the eye.¬† ‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôre gonna be okay.¬† You are so strong.¬† You have to stay here and look after Matthew, okay?‚Äù¬† I nodded reluctantly.¬† She walked up to the door and checked out the peep hole before opening it.¬† ‚ÄúLock us up tight and push a chair under the door knob after I leave, okay?¬† I‚Äôll be back in 10 at most.‚Äù



I was alone on the couch with Matty snuggled up next to me, already asleep again.¬† The rain pattering the building, the clock keeping track of my apprehension.¬† I watched it from the living room, watched the second hand go around and around and around‚Ä¶ 3 times, then 5‚Ä¶ 10‚Ä¶15‚Ä¶¬†



Shave-and-a-haircut.



I ran to the door, relief flooded my veins.¬† I looked through the peep hole and was happily met with Rodney‚Äôs big red nose looking back at me.¬† I undid the locks, moved the chair, and let him in.



‚ÄúHeeey Benj, your Mamma around..?‚Äù he asked in an uncharacteristically serious tone.



My face went pale.¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs not with you?¬† You didn‚Äôt even pass her on the way up?‚Äù¬†¬†



He scratched his chin in surprise. ‚ÄúN‚Ä¶No..? She tried callin‚Äô me up a few times.¬† I answered but didn‚Äôt seem like she could hear me.¬† Everything a‚Äôight, Benji‚Ä¶?‚Äù¬†¬†



I didn‚Äôt answer him.¬† I grabbed my bat and flashlight and went straight back to the door.¬† Right before I left, I paused, looking over at our dining table.¬† I grabbed a pair of scissors out of Mom‚Äôs embroidery bag and stuck them in my pocket.¬†¬†



‚ÄúWatch Matty,‚Äù I instructed, before walking out and shutting the door behind me.



I carefully made my way down the beige hallway, over the green, snail infested carpet, my bat propped over my shoulder.¬† I pressed the elevator button maybe 10 times before giving up.



‚ÄúI swear everything in this building is broken‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered before heading to the stair railing.¬† I looked straight down, into the darkness.¬† I could‚Äôve sworn it didn‚Äôt used to be that deep.¬† Grasping the flashlight with one hand and my bat with the other, I began the descent.



I winced as the stairs creaked underfoot.¬† The angles of the staircase were sharp, and every time I turned a corner I had to steel myself, my head filled with all sorts of abominations waiting in the dark to ambush me.



Down the stairs, platform after platform, more floors than I knew were possible...¬† Around and around and around‚Ä¶



I held my bat ready as my eyes caught something gleaming on the floor of the next platform.¬† I bent down to pick it up.



Round, thick-glassed spectacles, cracked and dripping with blood.¬† Caked in red there were a few strands of thick, black hair.¬† My eyes trailed it all the way across the floor, leading around the corner and down the stairs.¬† I followed it.



As I got deeper, any little light other than mine slowly succumbed to the darkness more and more.¬† The hair grew thicker, and extended across the walls and floors and stairs like veins.¬† It hung from the ceiling and seemed to grab at me more and more as I pushed forward.¬† At this point I decided to relinquish my bat, dropping it to the floor.¬† I reached into my pocket, pulling out Mom‚Äôs green scissors.¬† I hacked at the locks of hair that touched me, making sure my feet were freed up as well as I moved forward.



The stairs disappeared, and I knew I‚Äôd finally reached the bottom.¬† The room was wide and dark.¬† My light only revealed a foot or so in front of me, obscured by hair and dust.



I waited a few seconds in the silence, gathering up the courage to speak.



‚ÄúM-Mom‚Ä¶?‚Äù I uttered.



‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I cried out.¬† There was no answer, but I could hear movement in the dark.



I stayed close to the wall as I made my way around the room.¬† I stopped dead in my tracks as I felt a large lump in the thick wall of hair.¬† I scanned my flashlight upwards until I got to my mom‚Äôs face, her motionless body entombed against the wall, hair stuffed into her mouth and down her throat.¬† I desperately clawed at the wall, dropping my flashlight and cutting into the black tendrils.¬† Eventually I got enough that the rest of the strands snapped, making a musical tearing sound, and Mom slumped onto the floor.¬† I slowly pulled the hair inch by inch out of her throat.¬† She lay there unconscious, letting out sick, croaky breaths.¬† I bent down to check on her when something grabbed my ankle, dragging me animalistically to the center of the room.



I recognized her smell, the clammy feeling of her fingers on my skin, as she forced me onto my back, slamming my head against the concrete floor, making me see stars.¬† Everything was every color.¬† Her face was tv static.¬† Her eye was beautiful.¬† She was two people at the same time.¬† I wanted to be her, too.



I heard Matty crying upstairs.¬† It was so faint, but shot through the fog.



With all my strength, I drove the scissors upward.



She stopped them mere centimeters away from her pupil, forcing the scissors away from my hand by squeezing it ‚Äòtil my bones cracked and popped.¬† She began tearing chunks of hair from my scalp.¬† I screamed weakly as hot tears streamed down my cheeks. ¬† I tried closing my eyes but she used two of her hands to force them open.¬†¬†



Right as I was beginning to fall back under her spell, I felt something crawl across my forehead, and suddenly she froze in place, as if transfixed.¬† I saw a blur of the snail slowly inch between my eyes, and I took the one opportunity of clear-headedness to kick her as hard as I could in the stomach.¬† She stumbled backwards and collected herself, looking up and beginning to clamber back towards me before she was interrupted by getting shot in the face.



She fell backwards and I looked behind to follow the figure of my mom limping forward until she was hovering over the sputtering monster.¬† She promptly drove her slipper into its face, over and over and over, until it was a motionless, soundless pulp.¬† She took a step back and we both watched apprehensively as the bloody pile of ground beef slowly pushed out the large, juicy eyeball from its center.¬† It rolled onto the floor, all the heavenly light that came from it gone forever.



The head of the monster writhed and squirmed as the eyeball was followed by a bloody hand emerging from the carnage, and then a whole arm, and then a whole person.¬† She wore nothing but a nightgown, now stained red with blood.¬† She was completely bald, but her eyelashes were very blonde, almost white.



She was coughing and heaving in the air, crawling towards us.¬† My mom immediately went to help her, pulling her up and wrapping an arm around her, and I followed suit.



We all walked up the stairs together.¬† It was a far shorter trip up than down, and even after everything that happened, the climb felt easy.¬†¬†



My mom and Rod talked to the snail lady in the living room, asking her all kinds of questions, even though I‚Äôm sure they realized they couldn‚Äôt get all the answers.¬†¬†



I washed dishes while they spoke to her, and at one point my eyes met hers.¬† She smiled warmly at me, and without a word, we expressed how thankful we were that both of us had a piece of ourselves that was worth holding onto.



I turned off the kitchen sink, and watched the water spiral down the drain.

‚Äç

**Why This Pick?**

The powerhouse that is Toronto‚Äôs offense should have little to no issue bagging runs against starter Ryan Gusto (4.89 ERA). The Over has cashed with ease in 4 of Gusto‚Äôs last 5 starts, and he‚Äôs allowed 13 runs in his last 3 outings against far lesser batting lineups. On the other side, starter Shane Bieber is making his Blue Jays debut this evening, friends! And while I‚Äôm confident that Toronto takes a win here, I won‚Äôt risk the RL on Bieber‚Äôs first start since April ‚Äì I fully expect the home squad to get a few runs past him. My money‚Äôs on the Over to hit today.

It started a few months ago when I heard this dramatic shriek from the break room. I ran in expecting maybe a fire, or at least a coffee machine explosion. Nope. Just a spider the size of a nickel hanging out near the sugar packets. Everyone else looked like they were watching a horror movie in 4D.

I grabbed a paper towel, escorted the little guy outside, and went back to my desk. Thought nothing of it.

That was my mistake.

The following week, someone spotted a cricket in the bathroom and immediately shouted my name like I was being paged by the fire department. Suddenly, I was ‚Äúthe bug person.‚Äù

Since then, I‚Äôve been called in for houseflies, wasps, a giant moth that looked like it could pay rent, and even a lost ladybug (which I gently relocated like an Uber driver for insects).

The funniest part? HR actually updated the office handbook with: *‚ÄúIn case of pest emergencies, contact \[me\].‚Äù* Yes, it‚Äôs officially documented. I checked.

The irony? I don‚Äôt even *like* bugs. I‚Äôm just less dramatic about them than the rest of my coworkers. At this point, my marketing degree feels like a side hustle compared to my true role as free pest control.

On the plus side, someone did give me donuts last week as ‚Äúhazard pay,‚Äù so maybe I‚Äôll keep the title.",5,1755872451.0,story,8,1.0,False

Between my excitement for the upgrade in grind quality and starting a dream job last month I decided to buy the Aiden to celebrate. 

Aiden arrived yesterday so I went to my favorite local coffee shop and picked up some Ethiopian beans that I believe they roast to run some tests. I added this profile: https://brew.link/p/NGJJ and did a single serve with a grind setting of 3 and 5 and a grind setting of 7 for batch. Single serve was very good and batch was still very good but not quite as good as the single serve. However, I feel like both could be better. I'm just not good at determining what's necessarily wrong with it so I am hoping to learn from other people's methods.


I am wondering how are you brewing beans like Ethiopian and if you're using the Ode what settings you're using for batch and single serve. 


Looking forward to a lot of experimenting!",3,1755872440.0,FellowProducts,5,1.0,False

I posted a little while ago and here‚Äôs my update! I‚Äôm currently at 122lbs, down from 175, but I can‚Äôt seem to break past this plateau. My original goal was 110, but I don‚Äôt want to push myself into anything unhealthy just to get there.

It‚Äôs taken me two full years to get down to 122, so no, I‚Äôm not doing anything extreme or unhealthy. Most days I eat one to two small meals (about 1¬Ω cups each), plus snacks like nuts, a spoonful of peanut butter, or yogurt with granola. Sometimes I‚Äôll grab one of those little probiotic yogurt drinks too. I‚Äôll also add chia seeds into my tea or juice for extra fiber. My main meals are usually seafood, chicken, eggs, veggies, and fruit, though I do eat rice here and there. Hummus with veggies is a go-to, and I still let myself enjoy 70‚Äì80% dark chocolate or a sweet coffee once in a while.

I‚Äôve been careful and consistent, but I want to do this the right way. Has anyone else gotten stuck at this point? Any healthy tips for breaking through those last few pounds? I enjoy my body in a lean state I feel very confident that way so it‚Äôs a goal for me!",15,1755872288.0,progresspics,5,0.8,False

1mx7r1z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mx7r1z,BARCODE BUFFET,"Note: This post is not to brag, but to share infos lang to those who are interested.

Sharing to y'all the food that we availed to one of our events cause I feel like deserve mashare kasi sulit. And this is also for those who are looking for a place where to celebrate na Mura and Intimate.

We availed the 300 pesos per head buffet for 50pax. And as you scroll to the photos, you'll see different viands.

Plain Rice
Yang chow fried rice
Kulma
Lasagna
Shrimp
Roasted Chicken
Fish
Mixed vegetables/Chopsuey (not sure)
Fruits
Softdrinks

About the place: It was held there sa town (Rizal
Street) 2nd floor. It's a small place where you can have your intimate party. It was also a nice experience being there because they have speaker with microphone. They also have that stand for the cake and also some tables where visitors can put their gifts or you can put your give aways. May CR rin dun sa 2nd floor so no hassle.

Service: The staff that assisted us were kind. We had a lot of help coming from them. Kuya assisted
us in decorating a little bit (Pin lang naman din sa wall ng parang tarpaulin but still). Very accommodating.

The only thing that concerns me is the signal there. Mahina lang talaga signal, although they have wifi, it barely worked. Also the parking, Mahirap rin magpark dun since parang 2 or 3 cars lang ata maka park (depends on availability). But meron dun sa harap vacant lot na pwede magpark (not sure if its libre but that's what I heard) yung sa government ata yon na pinapapark nila cars.

Btw, the lechon is from PRINCE TASTY LECHON.

To be honest I can't remember na the taste but someone said kulang daw sa lasa. 32 kilos for 9000 pesos.",5,1755872229.0,zamboanga,0,1.0,False

Yesterday something happened that was very unpleasant for me. Even when I got home later that night, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I‚Äôm not very used to those kinds of situations, and it really affected me.

Yesterday I inspected a room, and when giving the rating, I left a note saying that the glass cups had fingerprints and dust on the outside, and the mugs were dirty with coffee marks. The housekeeper got upset and said it was strange because she had cleaned them very well, almost as if implying that I had made it up.

I had already cleaned them myself‚ÄîI did it so as not to bother her‚Äîbut I left the note so she could take it into account. Since I saw she didn‚Äôt like it, I told her: ‚ÄúNext time I find something, I‚Äôll call you so you can see it yourself.‚Äù

That‚Äôs what I did. In her next room, there was dirt in one corner of the fridge. I sent her a photo and told her: ‚ÄúPlease let me know once it‚Äôs clean.‚Äù After 49 minutes, I went to check and asked her: ‚ÄúDid you clean it already?‚Äù She said ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I asked: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you let me know?‚Äù

Then she got very upset and, in the middle of the hallway where guests were passing by, she raised her voice and said she didn‚Äôt agree with being called back for something so small that I could have done myself. She went on and said many more things, being very rude and agitated.

I responded very respectfully, telling her that I usually clean things myself to avoid bothering them, but since she thought I was making things up, I preferred that she could actually see her mistakes. She kept raising her voice and said several things that made me feel bad.

Honestly, I don‚Äôt think the way she spoke to me‚Äîyelling‚Äîwas appropriate. And now I don‚Äôt know if the mistake was mine. I really don‚Äôt know how to handle those situations. My boss just said that we shouldn‚Äôt send the evaluation results of the rooms back to the housekeepers so they won‚Äôt react that way, but honestly, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right.

1mx7qc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1mx7qc8/coffee_replacement/,Coffee replacement,"TMI warning:

I drink a cup of decaf coffee every morning to help me poo... however, it also causes diarrhea but if I don't have the coffee I get constipated fairly easily. I'm sure it's probably a mind over matter issue BUT I want to replace my coffee with something that tastes similar to coffee and is a hot drink so maybe I can trick myself into believing it will still help me go but that maybe I won't have diarrhea because I have some form of IBS and the coffee is just tearing up my stomach!!
I CANNOT add any caffeine, not even natural caffeine, I have a friend who sells bravenly and she is going to give me a sample of their coffee but I am not sure it will be good because it has 125 mg of natural caffeine and I definitely wouldn't be able to do that every day, if I can even do it once without having heart palpitations. I had a regular caffeinated coffee on the 20 mg dosage and I was having some jitters and felt weird so I'd just really rather stay away from caffeine. 

I have considered just switching to a protein shake in the morning, maybe even just half a cup of decaf coffee mixed with a protein shake warm to see if that gives me the same feel without the diarrhea... but I want to see what others have tried before I do anything different.
