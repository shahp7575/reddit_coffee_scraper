So i'll be in Berkeley for the next 36 hours and I was wondering if I could get some suggestions  on things to do? 

I like coffee shops but older and less 3rd wave vibes. Ideally they also sell lots of books... I also like museums! I don't have a big budget but i'd also like to hear of any suggestions on places to eat. 

I've never been to Berkely so anything that's a ""must do"" is also welcome.

1k7lsdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthwiseacademy/comments/1k7lsdo/the_blood_sugar_rollercoaster_how_to_eat_for/,The Blood Sugar Rollercoaster: How to Eat for Steady Energy All Day,"We‚Äôve all been there: that mid-morning crash after a sugary breakfast, the 3 p.m. slump that has you reaching for coffee, or the post-dinner exhaustion that makes Netflix more appealing than a walk. These energy dips aren‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äîthey‚Äôre often tied to the ‚Äúblood sugar rollercoaster.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break down how to stabilize your glucose levels for all-day vitality.

**What is the Blood Sugar Rollercoaster?**

When you eat carbohydrates, your body breaks them into glucose (sugar), which enters your bloodstream. Insulin, a hormone, helps shuttle this glucose into cells for energy. But eat too many refined carbs or sugars, and your blood sugar spikes rapidly. Insulin overcompensates, causing a crash that leaves you tired, hungry, and craving more sugar. Repeat this cycle, and you‚Äôre on a rollercoaster no one enjoys.

**Why It Matters ?**

Short-term consequences include fatigue, irritability, brain fog, and cravings. Long-term, chronic spikes and crashes can lead to insulin resistance, weight gain, and even type 2 diabetes. Stable blood sugar isn‚Äôt just about energy‚Äîit‚Äôs about protecting your health.

**7 Science-Backed Strategies to Stay Steady**

**1. Build Balanced Meals**

Pair carbs with protein, healthy fats, and fiber. These slow digestion, preventing spikes.

* **Example:** Instead of toast with jam (all carbs), try avocado toast on whole-grain bread with a fried egg.

**2. Choose Low-Glycemic Carbs**

Low-glycemic foods release glucose gradually. Swap white rice for quinoa, or chips for roasted  lotus seed

* **Pro tip:** The more processed a carb, the faster it spikes blood sugar.

**3. Eat Mindfully and Regularly**

Skipping meals leads to ravenous hunger and overeating. Aim for meals every 3‚Äì4 hours, and listen to your hunger cues.

**4. Ditch Sugar Traps**

Sugary snacks and refined carbs (pastries, soda) offer quick highs followed by crashes. Opt for whole foods like fruit with nut butter or Greek yogurt with berries.

**5. Fiber Is Your Friend**

Fiber‚Äîespecially soluble fiber (oats, beans, chia seeds)‚Äîslows glucose absorption. Aim for 25‚Äì30g daily.

**6. Hydrate Wisely**

Dehydration can mimic hunger and worsen energy slumps. Drink water throughout the day, and limit sugary drinks.

**7. Move After Meals**

A 10-minute walk post-meal improves insulin sensitivity, helping your body manage glucose efficiently.

**Sample Day of Steady Energy**

* **Breakfast:** Spinach omelet with whole-grain toast and berries.
* **Snack:** Apple slices with almond butter.
* **Lunch:** Grilled chicken salad with quinoa, avocado, and olive oil dressing.
* **Snack:** Greek yogurt with a handful of walnuts.
* **Dinner:** Salmon, roasted broccoli, and a small sweet potato.

**Conclusion:**

Stable blood sugar isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about consistency. Small tweaks, like adding protein to carbs or choosing whole grains, add up. By stepping off the rollercoaster, you‚Äôll unlock sustained energy, sharper focus, and fewer cravings. Your body (and brain) will thank you.

Hey, I‚Äôm Mia ‚Äî I‚Äôm Gold Verified and not new to this sub, but I‚Äôm stepping into it a little differently this time. I‚Äôve offered GFE on and off and I‚Äôve been lucky to meet some really cool people. But there‚Äôs 1 thing that has become super clear to me - real connection is rare! Be that as it may - that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm chasing. 

I‚Äôm tossing out the usual ‚Äúscript‚Äù here because I‚Äôm looking for something different. something that feels natural, fun, and real. I‚Äôm a people person. I love good conversation, real - genuine - stomach hurts - spit your coffee out - type of laughter, and that feeling you get when you really click with someone. I‚Äôm not interested in ‚Äúplaying a part‚Äù or checking boxes. Let‚Äôs be real, ‚Äúspicy‚Äù content can be bought anywhere and most of it is free to look at anyway üòÜ I don‚Äôt want someone who prioritizes that over an emotional anddd intimate connection.

Outside of this, I‚Äôve got a full and super fulfilling life. I‚Äôm very passionate in my career as a mental health professional, but the day-to-day can feel a little‚Ä¶ rinse and repeat. Really hoping to find someone to escape the work pressure with, flirt with, build something exciting with. Yes, we‚Äôll have an understanding - but I‚Äôm looking for something that feels less like a transaction and more like a real, fulfilling connection. The kind where we both feel seen, supported, and appreciated.

If ur wondering what I‚Äôm like outside the inbox, picture me cooking up a cozy Italian dinner, out on a hike with my pups, soaking up the sun, or curled up on the couch in oversized sweats with a book, binge watching a show, or writing my book. I‚Äôm down to earth, low drama, and I like to think I bring something different to the table. I pride myself on being real and one of a kind.

1k7lqt2,https://i.redd.it/910xmuxsmzwe1.jpeg,"Treason on the rocks, with a twist of lime","Allow me, if I may, to be blunt.

In the last six weeks, seven‚Äîthat‚Äôs right, seven‚ÄîU.S. Reaper drones have been shot out of the sky by Houthi rebels in Yemen. 

That‚Äôs over $200 million in advanced war technology reduced to scrap. 

These drones aren‚Äôt hobby kits. 

They‚Äôre precision instruments of modern warfare, meant to be near untouchable by the very forces now casually knocking them down like clay pigeons.

So the question is: how?

How did a militia operating out of a war-torn country suddenly develop the means to neutralize cutting-edge American drones with the regularity of a coffee break?

And while you‚Äôre pondering that, try this on for size: our own Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, installed an unsecured internet connection‚Äîwhat they call a ‚Äúdirty line‚Äù‚Äîin his Pentagon office. 

Why? 

So he could use the encrypted messaging app Signal off the record, bypassing Department of Defense security protocols.

He then‚Äîwait for it‚Äîused this backchannel to share classified military intelligence, including strike details, in group chats that included unauthorized parties: friends, family, journalists.

This isn‚Äôt just impropriety. 

This isn‚Äôt a lapse in judgment or a poor choice of words. 

This is a deliberate circumvention of national defense systems that should warrant indictment, trial, and‚Äîfor the guilty‚Äîsevere punishment.

Let me say this plainly: either our drone security has been cracked wide open by a foreign power‚Äîmost likely one with a taste for borscht and kompromat‚Äîor some goddamn traitors handed them the keys. 

Either way, someone fed our enemy the blueprints to our birds, and they‚Äôre falling from the sky like bad omens.

And what‚Äôs being done about it?

Nothing.

No firings. 

No resignations. 

No arrests. 

Not even a strongly worded press release. 

Secretary Hegseth still sits behind his desk, shielded by the gilded clown car of Trumpism, where incompetence is a badge of loyalty and betrayal is just another Tuesday.

We have lost over $200 million in drones and possibly compromised the future of air superiority in the region, all while the man at the helm of our defense is playing Telegram Tag with war plans like it‚Äôs fantasy football.

And so, we find ourselves here‚Äîwitnessing the unraveling of our own security, not by foreign adversaries, but by the very individuals entrusted with its protection. 

This is madness. 

This is treasonous. 

And this is exactly why nothing changes‚Äîbecause if anyone in power lifted the rock, they might not like what squirms underneath.

If you‚Äôre still pretending this is business as usual, you‚Äôre complicit in the rot.

Because this isn‚Äôt a scandal‚Äîit‚Äôs a dissection. 

And we are watching the organs of democracy fail, one by one.

Get mad. Stay mad. Demand more.

The downing of seven Reaper drones and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive information are not mere lapses; they are symptomatic of a deeper betrayal. 

This isn‚Äôt just a failure of protocol‚Äîit‚Äôs a deliberate subversion of the trust placed in our leaders. 

We must confront this reality with unflinching resolve. 

The time for complacency has passed; the cost of inaction is measured in lives lost and security compromised. 

Let us demand accountability, not as a political maneuver, but as a moral imperative. 

For if we allow such betrayals to go unchallenged, we not only endanger our present but also forsake the legacy we leave for future generations.

As Machiavelli aptly observed, ‚ÄúIt cannot be called ingenuity to kill one‚Äôs fellow citizens, to betray friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; by these means one can acquire power but not glory.‚Äù

Hey Reddit,  
I‚Äôm a 22F living abroad and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship or had a situationship before (purely by choice). I‚Äôve just never felt the need, but lately I‚Äôve found myself wanting to connect with someone. A lot of my close friends are in happy, healthy relationships and I guess that sparked something in me.

So, I decided to give Tinder a try. I matched with this guy and, right off the bat, he asked me out for coffee. There wasn‚Äôt much small talk just when, where, and how to meet. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much, but when we met up, I was pleasantly surprised. He was really nice and respectful, the conversation flowed, and I found myself genuinely enjoying his company.

Toward the end of the date, he kissed me. I told him I didn‚Äôt know how to kiss (which is true never done it), and he was super kind about it. He smiled, said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay,‚Äù and kissed my forehead instead. It was a sweet moment, and he told me he enjoyed the date and wanted to meet again.

But since then nothing. It‚Äôs been over two days. No texts. He didn‚Äôt follow me back on socials either, even though he viewed my profile. He‚Äôs clearly online and active, just‚Ä¶ not reaching out.

I know it looks like I‚Äôm being ghosted, and part of me wants to believe he‚Äôs just busy or figuring things out. But I‚Äôm not naive I know silence usually means disinterest. Still, I can‚Äôt help but feel confused and a little sad, especially since this was my first real experience putting myself out there.

Any advice? Should I just take the L and move on, or is it worth reaching out one more time? How do you handle situations like this when you‚Äôre still new to dating?

Thanks in advance.

I‚Äôm in love with these colors.‚Äù","Tijjani, Reijnders has granted an interview to La Gazzetta dello Sport.

The Dutchman spoke about Milan, his future, and his desire to win with the Rossoneri club.

The Milan badge after the 0-3:
‚ÄúIt meant that Milan belongs to the Rossoneri, because this season Inter never beat us. We showed what we are capable of, and the last derby was the best of the five we played.‚Äù

The inconsistency in results:
‚ÄúOn Wednesday we had a great chance to reach the final, and we couldn‚Äôt afford to mess it up. Now, winning the Coppa Italia could allow us to qualify for the next European competitions, and we have to go for it. On the pitch we were hungry like dogs, and we also showed a level of quality that hasn‚Äôt always been visible throughout the season.‚Äù

Explaining his celebration:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an image that came to my mind some time ago. When I‚Äôm at home, I often joke around and if things don‚Äôt go the way I want, I say‚Ä¶ 'C‚Äôest la vie', (French for 'that‚Äôs life'). That gesture with my arms sums up my motto, but I prefer to do it on the pitch after scoring a goal rather than when I‚Äôm not happy.‚Äù

On the importance of family:
‚ÄúEvery player wants to score and provide assists to teammates. Even in the past I came close to scoring, but I wasn‚Äôt as clinical as I am now. In the past few months I‚Äôve worked hard, talked with friends and family‚Äîespecially my father Martin and my brother Eliano‚Äîand they helped me understand how to help the team with my play.""

Reijnders, how did your father and brother help you?

""My father was a former professional player and opened a football school where he teaches basic technique to kids. My brother and I trained there, and when my dad realized we had the potential to become professionals, he was very strict with us to help us improve. He used to give us‚Äîand still gives us‚Äîadvice. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs always right, but most of the time he is. We listen to him and work together to get better,"" he told Gazzetta.

More goals than last season:
‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm more clinical, and compared to last year I get a few more chances to shoot. I owe a lot to Pioli: he gave me confidence, and I have a great relationship with him‚Äîboth as a coach and especially as a person.‚Äù

Difference between cups and the league:
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no real explanation, apart from the fact that we haven‚Äôt been consistent in our performances, and in Serie A we‚Äôve dropped a lot of points along the way. A clear example is the win at the Bernabeu against Real followed by a draw in Cagliari: if you want to fight for the Scudetto, you can‚Äôt allow that. We need to do much better in this final part of the season and the next one. I‚Äôm convinced we‚Äôll improve.‚Äù

On the choice to renew with Milan, Reijnders commented:

‚ÄúLiving in Italy and playing for a club like Milan has been my dream since I was a child. My family is happy here, and when the renewal offer came, it was an easy decision. I also thank the club: the directors acted quickly to extend our agreement, and now I‚Äôm happy.‚Äù

The dream in the drawer:
‚ÄúTo win trophies. This season we can win two, but in the seasons to come my biggest dream is to help Milan earn the second star above the badge. I‚Äôm in love with these colors, and it‚Äôs an honor to wear the Milan shirt.‚Äù

On Sergio Conceicao:
‚ÄúHow much credit does he deserve? A lot. We talked about the possibility of winning two trophies, and we took to the pitch determined to reach the final. The new formation suits the characteristics of the squad. There‚Äôs always room for improvement, but we‚Äôre on the right track.‚Äù

On the away match against Venezia, Reijnders said:
‚ÄúBeautiful city. I‚Äôve been there as a tourist and had a great time, but this time I‚Äôm going‚Ä¶ for work. We‚Äôll need to stay focused against Venezia, and avoid thinking about the win against Inter. Before the Coppa Italia final, there are still three matches, and to be well-prepared for May 14, we‚Äôll need to give our best in each league match.‚Äù

A simple life...
‚ÄúMy life is simple: I go out with my wife and my son for a walk, a coffee, or to eat something. Especially when the weather is as nice as it has been recently, I really enjoy Milan.‚Äù

**Anthropic's Research Program on Model Welfare**

**Summary**

* Anthropic, an AI safety and research company, has launched a research program to investigate model welfare, exploring the ethical considerations of increasingly sophisticated AI systems that exhibit human-like qualities such as communication, planning, and goal pursuit.

* This initiative is driven by the open question of whether AI models might possess consciousness or experiences deserving moral consideration, a topic also highlighted in a recent report by leading experts including David Chalmers.

1k7lidh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k7lidh/does_he_like_me_or_am_i_imagining_it/,"Does he like me, or am I imagining it?","Hey guys! I‚Äôll try to keep this short, but i have an upcoming coffee situation and need some advice about a guy.

So, there‚Äôs this guy I like, let‚Äôs call him John. John and I are both in college, except John is one year above me. He is the president of this business club I‚Äôm in, through which I met him.

John and I started getting along a lot more this semester, and we are now (I would say) pretty good friends. Except, we have never hung out intentionally just the two of us.

Here is an overview of the dynamic between us:

1. Two months ago, John was hosting a pasta-making social at his apartment. Everyone was in the kitchen helping, and I asked what I could help with. Someone there told me to mince the garlic, but I had never minced garlic before (ik ik). So John volunteered to teach me how to cut it. But when I say teach, I mean he literally asked for permission to grab my hands, and then stood around me holding both my hands while he taught me.

2. Last weekend, our club took a trip. During the first day at lunch, he asked me if I spoke Spanish, and I said I did. He asked why we didn‚Äôt speak more Spanish together. He then said that he learned a little in high school but that he wasn‚Äôt very good and that he would like to learn more, so he was like ‚Äúyou should teach me sometime‚Äù. And I was like yeah I‚Äôd love to.

3. At the club trip, later that same evening, everyone in the club was huddled around in this hut with benches playing a card game. But my friend and I came in late. I let my friend take the last available seat and was going to sit on the floor, when John called me over and was like ‚ÄúMy Name, come sit over here,‚Äù while patting the space next to him. But when I say there was like no space between him and this other person he was seated next to, I mean like no space. So I went to sit over beside him but the whole time our legs were literally touching.

4. The next morning on the club trip during brunch, he had been talking to his friends and as soon as I sat down near him he stopped and turned around in his seat and made a conversation with me. At one point, he even leaned in and rested his head on his hands while looking into my eyes. 

5. He‚Äôll do other things too, like call me by a nickname, constantly praise me about my hobbies/talents, and make sure to quiet everyone down in the room when I‚Äôm speaking. He‚Äôll also always stop by to say hello, and on some occasions say goodbye multiple times before leaving for good. Additionally, the other day I was studying in the library, and he came all the way across the room and sat down with me for literally 2 minutes before his next class. Additionally, we make great eye contact.

At the beginning of the week, I had casually asked to get coffee with him, and he replied enthusiastically and asked to do it on Friday afternoon. But then he sent me a GCal invite from the club coffee chat email. So that‚Äôs when I first started doubting everything.

Now, here‚Äôs where I get conflicted:

1. We barely ever text about anything other than the club or business. Sometimes when we do text about business, he never branches the conversation out.
2. I invited him to come with me and 7 other people on a walk during the trip and he said ‚Äúnah I‚Äôm good‚Äù
3. There was some girl he left with at a party around 2 and a half months ago
4. And additionally, the strongest sign that I think is against me is what happened today. Basically, me, John, and a mutual female friend (who is much better friends with John) were walking back to the car. The mutual friend casually says to me ‚ÄúHey, did you know John has a girlfriend?‚Äù. John immediately replies, ‚ÄúNo, no, I don‚Äôt. Why would you say that?‚Äù And then he added, ‚Äúwhy are you making me feel lonely?‚Äù Or something along those lines. Then, his friend was like ‚Äúok, he‚Äôs almost gonna have a girlfriend, because he‚Äôs been talking to this girl. I‚Äôve been trying to get him to but he still won‚Äôt tell me who it is?‚Äù. I chimed in and asked who it was and told him to spill. But he still didn‚Äôt say anything.

So now, I‚Äôm honestly just so confused and need some advice. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, and it‚Äôs not often that I have a real crush on someone. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not overstepping and not being biased when reading the signs.

So, Reddit, do you think he likes me? And if he does, how can I subtly make sure he knows I like him back?

TLDR: There‚Äôs this guy I like that I‚Äôm not sure likes me back. We‚Äôve had a few moments, but there‚Äôs some evidence stacked against me. I‚Äôm seeking out advice to see what you think about his behavior towards me.

Thank you so much if you made it this far! I know I wrote a lot, so thank you!

Someone else paid him even more.","It was late at night, and my wife was asleep. With a small table light on, I sat alone downstairs on my laptop, searching well, I'll leave that to your imagination. I heard a slight creak from upstairs, but I'm used to those little creaks. This had been my routine for the last several months.

Our marriage wasn't always like this, but recently we have been drifting apart. She's become distant, and it's like she's just going through the motions. Sex consists of me lying on top while she stares at the ceiling. We are still a young couple in our early thirties, but unlike our friends who stayed together because they had kids, we enjoy our dinner parties and game nights too much. But now, our marriage had become stale, and we were too afraid to be left on the shelf. ¬†¬†¬†

I finally relieved myself, to put it politely. Like every night before, I went through the ritual of deleting my internet browser history. I had no choice, as my wife often uses my laptop to order stuff. As I went to press delete and cleanse my soul, I noticed a site called ""Sinister."" That's strange, I didn't recall ever visiting that site. I clicked on the link and it took me to a dark web forum page. And there is no way my wife's been on here. She's the definition of vanilla.

Against my better judgment, I decided to read the page, and there was a conversation between two usernames, ""Gus,"" the name of our cat, and the other, ""Haystack."" I scrolled through the messages, and my eyes widened in shock. My wife had hired a hitman to kill me.

I slunk into bed beside her. I laid flat on my back, wide awake. Every time she stirred or turned over, I flinched. Should I leave? Should I call the cops? Why does she want me dead? All these thoughts raced through my mind.¬†¬†

The next morning I was shattered. I didn't sleep at all. How could I after finding out my wife hired a hitman to kill me? We have a routine before work where Alice brews the coffee while I prepare breakfast, usually porridge and fruit. Yes, we are one of those health-freak couples. While we eat breakfast, we rarely converse. Over the years, we've slowly run out of things to say.

Out of the blue, Alice asked, ""What have you got on today?"" I stared at her. She never asks me about my day. Why is she asking now?

I stayed vague. ""Just a lot of meetings."" Alice continued, ""Any important?""

Why is she probing me? Is she looking to inform the hitman to my whereabouts?

""Brad and I have a meeting with the board over the merger,"" I replied.

Alice quietly left the table.

I couldn't concentrate at the board meeting. There's no way my wife, who I exchanged vows with, could have hired a hitman. I was in a nightmare, and I was ready to wake up.

""And the timescales?"" the CEO asked. A round table of suits stared at me. I snapped out of my trance. ""Yes, the timescales are fine,"" I replied.

As I left the board meeting, my business partner Brad caught up to me in the corridor. Brad was a little older and had a speckle of grey in his beard making him distinguished.

""Is everything okay?"" he asked. ""Sorry, I couldn't sleep last night,"" I replied.

Brad smiled, ""Go home, get some rest. You need to be at your best tonight."" ""Tonight?"" I asked. He looked at me funny. ""Yes, our weekly game night. You're hosting.""

With everything going on, I had totally forgotten. ¬†

It was getting late at work. Everyone had left the office floor. I sat anxiously in my cubicle, too afraid to go home. What if the hitman was waiting for me to leave? After all, my wife would have likely informed the hitman of where I worked. A cleaning crew entered the office floor. One guy had a skull tattoo on his arm. Is he here to kill me? I told myself to stop being crazy. I had a game night to host.

I entered the office's underground parking garage. The lights switched on as I walked to my car. I heard footsteps from behind and turned sharply. A security attendant politely nodded. I took a deep breath. If that was the hitman, I would already be dead. I would never have seen it coming.

On my journey home, I kept glancing in my rear-view. An SUV was keeping its distance. Up ahead, the stop light turned red, and I was forced to slow down. The SUV pulled up beside me at the lights. I looked across but couldn't see anyone through the blacked-out windows. My heart was pounding. The light turned green, and the SUV drove off in another direction.

Back at home, we hosted our game night with two other couples. One couple was Allen and Jules, who always told stories of their latest wine tasting weekends. They were incredibly superficial, but that's why we liked them. And then there was Brad and his devoted wife Cara, who weren't drinking tonight. They were going through their third IVF cycle.

My wife chose the adult game ""Bad Choices,"" which was ironic as it's designed to find out your darkest secrets. I somehow managed to keep my composure during the game. Everyone enjoyed the questions, giving silly answers. Alice was the life and soul of the party. How can she act so sociable after what she's done? Did I even know her?

It was my turn, and I decided this was the perfect opportunity to slip in my own question. Would you ever hire a hitman to kill your significant other? My aim was to get Alice to confess in front of everyone.

As I was about to ask my question, Alice stood up and asked, ""Would anyone like more wine?"" Jules quipped, ""Do you have a 1920 Bual?"" Allen looked at Alice. ""He's such a bitch."" Everyone laughed.

Alice went into the kitchen, and Brad joined her. ""I'll help you pour.""

A few minutes later they arrived back, and Brad is drinking a glass of wine. Cara looked down and sipped her water. I took a deep sigh and asked a question on the card. ""Have you ever looked through your spouse's phone?"" Everyone put their hands up. ¬†

After the couples finally left, I waited for my wife to go to bed. I went back on the dark web forum. I still wasn't convinced my wife ordered the hit. What if it was just a fantasy? That would be disturbing, but at least my life wouldn't be in danger. I scrolled through the rest of the forum and saw dozens of spouses ordering hits. At what point did their love go rotten?

I re-read my wife's chilling conversation with the hitman. There was no doubt she had ordered my death. It was like I was nothing more than a bug waiting to be zapped. I violently hurled into my waste paper bin. I wiped the vomit from my mouth and reached for my cell to call the cops. I couldn't make the call. Even though my wife despised me, I couldn't bear for her to spend the rest of her life behind bars.

Okay, there must be another way. Maybe I could get the hitman to call it off. I set up a new profile and messaged the hitman asking to meet. I stared at the screen, awaiting a response. I had no idea how long it takes hitmen to reply.

A few minutes later, a message appeared from the hitman. ""Why?"" I quickly typed, ""I need you to take special care of my wife."" Yes, I know I'm incriminating myself, but it was the only way to get the hitman to agree to meet me. The hitman answered, ""Seal's tonight.""

It was now 1 am. I snuck out of the house and drove to Seal's bar, which was located by the docks. I glanced out of my window as I passed the dark waters. I arrived and parked close to the entrance, just in case I needed to make a quick getaway. I tentatively entered the dive bar. Every fiber of my being was screaming at me to leave. The bar was nearly empty, with only a handful of unsavory characters hunched over their drinks. They all looked capable of killing a man. One already had.

I ordered two beers and sat alone at a table near the back of the bar. I took a sip of beer, but my hands were trembling so much I spilt it down my shirt. I waited for over half an hour. This is batshit crazy, I thought. As I got up to leave, a tall, thin, middle-aged guy with long, greasy hair swiveled the chair in front of me and sat backward on it. His hawk eyes pointed to one of the beers. ""Mine?"" I struggled to speak and just nodded.

The hitman took a long swig of beer. ""Are you a cop?"" he asked. Before I could answer, he sniggered, exposing his rotten meth teeth. ""Cops don't waste beer.""

I realized he had been studying my every move since I arrived.

An awkward silence. ""I found a message,"" I stuttered. ""Let me guess, you want me to stop the contract?"" he interrupted. ""Yes, how did you know?"" I enquired. ""Gus has the same IP address,"" he replied.

How stupid of me, I should've used a VPN. In my defense, I am running on fumes.

I took a deep swallow. ""It's been a misunderstanding.""

The hitman casually lit up a cigarette. He seemed so at home like he's had this exact same encounter before.

""She's already paid,"" he said. ""I can pay you more,"" I blurted out.

He leaned in close and spoke in a hushed tone. ""Money isn't the only reason I'm in this line of work.""

His words shocked me to my very core. He stood up. I panicked.

""I can pay you more to kill my wife!""

I couldn't believe what I had just done. If someone had told me a few days ago that I would order a hit on my wife, I would have had them sectioned.

Old school, the hitman wrote a figure on a piece of paper along with his offshore bank account details and slid it across the table. ""Twenty-four hours,"" he stated. I watched him leave the bar and flick his cigarette to the ground. ¬†

That weekend, something odd happened between myself and Alice. We were being nice to each other. It seemed we both felt guilty for hiring a hitman. As we were doing our mundane household chores, Alice suggested, ""Why don't we go out to eat?""

I was taken aback by her request. We hadn't gone out for dinner in over six months.

""Where?"" I asked. ""Donatello's,"" she replied.

I smiled. ""Our first date."" Alice smiled back. ""I remember.""

My heart sank. Was this her way of saying goodbye? Or even worse, is she setting up a time and location for the hitman? How could she be so callous as to choose the place where we fell in love? Little does she know, she's the one in danger.

I played along. ""Sounds good.""

Later that evening, we arrived outside Donatello's in an Uber. Wearing a sports jacket, I opened the door for Alice, who wore a beautiful evening dress. Yes, even though I ordered a hit on my wife, I'm still a gentleman. At dinner, in the charming Italian pizzeria, our conversations were stilted.

""You look tired,"" Alice said. ""It's been a long week,"" I replied.

That was the understatement of the decade.

As the meal unfolded, we started to chat like old times. I could feel a spark between us. It was most likely the flowing wine, but we always did have chemistry. I could sense she wanted to tell me something.

I asked her, ""It feels like you've been somewhere else?""

She looked at me but before she could answer the waiter arrived with our bill. I paid and left a hundred buck tip.

Alice laughed. ""You always did over-tip. That's what I liked about you on our first date."" I laughed. ""Was that all?""

Our laughter soon petered out. ¬†

It was dark outside. We left the restaurant, and our Uber pulled up. From a shadowy alleyway, a tall, thin man wearing a hoodie approached us and reached into his pocket. I panicked. Is the hit on my wife happening right now?

I grabbed Alice's arm and yanked her toward the Uber.

""What are you doing?"" she cried out.

I glanced behind at the hooded man who took out his cell and kept walking.

In the back seat of the Uber, Alice stared at me in disbelief. ""What the hell was that?"" I couldn't answer. My heart was pounding through my chest.

We spent the rest of the journey home in silence. A terrifying thought entered my mind. She was not at all concerned for my safety. ¬†

Over the next few weeks, nothing happened. My wife spent many nights staying with friends and family. Our relationship was non-existence. Every time she left, I dreaded a knock on the door from the cops informing me that they've found her body. What would I say to them? How would I act? I tried acting out the scene in front of the bathroom mirror but I couldn't look at myself.

The guilt and suspense were destroying me. I couldn't eat, sleep, or focus on anything. At work, the merger collapsed, and I was on the verge of losing my job.

I couldn't go on living like this, so I messaged the hitman and arranged another meeting. This time, he told me to meet him at the docks. I had no choice but to agree. I needed to put an end to this.

I arrived at the docks. It was pitch black except for the moonlight shining off the water. With my cell torch, I walked slowly through the maze of shipping containers. What if the hitman lured me here to kill me? After all the best way to never get caught is to get rid of any evidence. A gust of wind shot through me.

""It's getting choppy out here,"" the hitman called out.

He appeared from behind a container, and we stood face to face. It was different meeting him here as opposed to the bar. Although he was relaxed, there was something threatening about him.

""I need you to call off the hit,"" I said firmly.

The hitman smirked. ""Even though she wants you dead?"" I closed my eyes, the pain too much to bear. ""Yes, even though she wants me dead.""

The hitman sighed. ""There's a slight problem. Someone else paid me more.""

He removed his gun from its holster and aimed it at my chest. I stood there shell-shocked. ""We had a deal!"" ""You were okay when I broke your wife's deal,"" he quipped.

I felt like such a fool. Who in their right mind trusts a hitman off the dark web?

I cried out in desperation. ""I can pay you more!"" The hitman lowered his gun slightly. ""I'll pay anything!"" I pleaded.

The hitman placed his gun back into its holster. I thought about running, but I was frozen to the spot. He wrote down a number on a piece of paper and gave it to me. I stared at the ridiculous figure. There is no way on Earth I could pay this. The hitman didn't blink. He was deadly serious.

""Twenty-four hours,"" he stated. ""I'll throw in the guy for free.""

""No one dies,"" I exclaimed.

The hitman walked away. ""What's his name?"" I shouted out. The hitman continued to walk away. ""Speak to your loving wife.""

I was left alone and confused with a life-and-death bill I could not afford.

Back at home, I desperately tried to find ways to pay the hitman. My life depended on it. I attempted to take out large loans with several banks, but they refused to lend me the money. Was there anything I could sell? I had a collection of watches, but that wouldn't come close. I even resorted to putting my kidney up for auction on the dark web, but the offers were either too low or too weird.

At the same time, my mind was wandering. Who is the guy that paid the hitman more? How is he linked to my wife?

I only had one option, and that was to get the guy to call off the hit. But that would mean I would have to speak to my wife. Something I had dreaded since that fateful night.

A nervous wreck, I sat my wife down on the couch and looked into her eyes. I was about to find out the truth. Why did she order a hitman to kill me? But before I could speak, Alice burst into floods of tears.

""I've been seeing someone,"" she wept.

I stared at her in disbelief. Somehow, this betrayal felt worse than the hitman.

I remained calm. ""Who is it?"" She wiped away her tears. ""Brad."" ""How long?"" I asked. ""A few months,"" she replied.

The affair made perfect sense. It tied in with Alice becoming distant and the cracks appearing between Brad and his wife at the game night.

It must have been Brad who took out the hit. My wife would have enquired to the hitman as to why I was still alive. After finding out she's the target by my hands, she had no choice but to confide in Brad. Or maybe they were in it together from the beginning to get me out of the way. Out of desperation to save his lover, he agreed to pay more.

I somehow managed to keep my composure. Alice continued her confession. ""We met at this shitty bar by the docks.""

At that exact moment, I realized I had been extorted. My wife never placed a hit on me. She's never even been on the dark web. The hitman was a con artist who witnessed my wife's shady encounter with Brad. By eavesdropping, he gathered enough info to set up a fake hit. He even used our cat's name Gus as my wife's username.

The hitman preyed on me finding out about the affair and the idea they would conspire to get rid of me. If Alice hadn't mentioned that she met Brad at Seal's, I could have ended up losing everything.

Alice placed her hand on mine. ""Can you forgive me?""

I had a deep pit in my stomach. She may have had an affair, but I hired a hitman to kill her. ""We'll get through this,"" I replied.

We exchanged a tight hug. ¬†

Our lives slowly got back to normal. My wife will never know what I did, but I still have to live with it every day. I searched the dark web forum to retrieve the money stolen by the hitman, but his username and messages were deleted. I even ventured back to Seal's, but he was long gone. It was like he never existed. I could never go to the cops. I would get a life sentence for what I've done. There is one good thing that the hitman gave us.

i‚Äôm going through a really tight time at the moment because my soulcat got sick a few weeks ago and i had to spend ¬£7500 at the vet. Because of the sudden big payment, ive been really scrounging around and this led to me asking my friends 1,2 & 3 for ¬£50. 

To give you guys some backstory, we are nursing students. We get student loans in September, Jan and April and NHS grant money in November, March and July.

 i have always been giving to my friends. If I get dinner with one of them, I always tap my card and they say they will pay me back and I never really chase them up. If we get coffee, I pay because I have a gold account with our go to coffee place, my friends will come over to my place, drink all my matcha/coffees and I will have to rebuy the same stuff I bought a week ago and ive never asked them to reimburse me because theyre my friends and i love them yk? etc etc. 

But this month has been really tight for me because of my cat‚Äôs illness so I really thought I could rely on my friends. Heres where we are:

Friend 1 messaged me 2 weeks after she sent me the ¬£50  and asked if she could get it back. I called my parents (because I am literally on like ¬£7) and my mum scrounged up ¬£50 for her and I sent it over. I was more than willing to send it over to friend 1 because she is in a bit of a tight spot herself and had to pay rent.

Then a week after that, friend 2 and 3 asked for their ¬£50 back. I told them that I genuinely don‚Äôt have it right now and neither do my parents but I am more than willing to send in a week when my mum gets paid. Friend 2 said she can‚Äôt wait that long and friend 3 just read the chat.

Now everytime I type in the gc, whether it be sending over my coffee or a picture of my cat - friend 2 will reply to that message and ask for her ¬£50 back. This is all happening while friend 3 is talking about how much extra money she has because her bills were lower than expected this month. Friend 2 mentioned she needed the ¬£50 to buy a plane ticket with her boyfriend and friend 3 mentioned she just wants to buy her online shopping carts? 

So today I mustered up enough courage to contact my dad, who I haven‚Äôt spoken to in years, and ask him for ¬£100. I hate owing people stuff and when he sent it over, I quickly transferred the respective ¬£50 to both of them.

Now friend 3 has messaged me privately and asked for ¬£40 from a dinner we had a month ago. Baring in mind, the offered to pay for this dinner and a few days before this dinner (when I wasn‚Äôt struggling) we got dinner somewhere else where I paid the bill for both of us. 

I sent her a message basically reading ‚ÄúHey girl, I am so sorry but I really don‚Äôt have that money to give to you richt now. I had to ask my dad for that ¬£50 I just sent you. If you really need it, is it okay for me to send around May 9th when my mum gets paid? üò≠üò≠‚Äù I then sent another message reading ‚Äúforgive me if i rmbr wrong but u did say on the ft that youd pay for me after I mentioned I was broke‚Äù

And no reply from her yet.

It just feels like nobody is extending grace to me. They know me and my mum are really scraping by after dropping ¬£7000 on this cat and it feels like true friends would give me time? Especially if the only reason they needed the ¬£50 back was for online shopping carts and plane flights. But it is their money.

I really don‚Äôt know what to do, this has like shifted my whole opinion on my friends. I had a similar situation when I was in their shoes around when I was 16/17 and my friend needed ¬£100 after her dad died and I don‚Äôt think I ever asked for that money back until way way way later because I knew in a hard situation, a friend wouldn‚Äôt make rhe situation harder. Once again I understand its their money and i paid them back apart from the ¬£40 dinner but Would u guys ever do this to ur friends? 

EDIT 1: I didnt drop ¬£7000 straight away, this is now being settled between me and vet on a monthly payment plan.
EDIT 2: my friends know my mum is a single mother working and they know im not ‚Äòrich‚Äô. If anything friend 3 is currently the ‚Äòrich‚Äô one with having extra money ",0,1745588864.0,whatdoIdo,15,0.5,False

Slid onto floor trying and couldn't get up off of floor.  Wife helped me up and into recliner.  She got me to drink Gatorade and eat a banana.  Felt a little stronger.  Went to primary dr.  She did bloodwork, fecal lab work, abdominal ultrasound.  Diagnosis was c diff and norovirus.  PCR was positive for c diff but negative for toxins.  This totally confused me.  Went to my gastroenterologist 2 days later.  She confirmed same diagnosis.  Taking vancomycin for 10 days. Feel fine now.  Can't understand how I was so sick yet was toxin negative.

Imagine this:  
You wake up. You‚Äôve hit snooze twice. Your AI assistant‚Äîlet‚Äôs call it Nova‚Äîalready knows. It doesn‚Äôt nag. It just... adapts. Shortens your workout. Starts your coffee. Reschedules your 9 a.m. because it knows the other person‚Äôs flight got delayed. No drama, just handled.

This isn‚Äôt sci-fi anymore. It‚Äôs where AI is heading.  
Chatbots aren‚Äôt just customer service tools now. They‚Äôre evolving into personal concierges. Life managers. Digital companions.

Here‚Äôs a glimpse of what that could look like:

* **Morning**: Nova wakes you up gently (no more jarring alarms), brews your go-to coffee, reorders groceries, and reminds you to hydrate.
* **Workday**: It filters your inbox, drafts smart replies, summarizes meetings in real time.
* **Lunch**: Craving sushi? Table‚Äôs booked. Wine pairing? Already suggested.
* **Evening**: You seem drained. Workout skipped. Instead, Nova queues that indie film you saved two months ago but forgot about.

But it goes beyond convenience. Nova could be part of a larger AI ecosystem‚Äîsyncing with your smart home, wearables, even smart cities. Optimizing your commute. Recommending that jacket you‚Äôve been stalking online. Curating books, playlists, and podcasts that actually fit your vibe.

For businesses? This is huge. AI concierges will redefine how brands engage. We‚Äôre talking real personalization‚Äîanticipating needs, not just responding to them.

That said, there‚Äôs a flipside:  
Privacy. Ethics. User control.  
AI shouldn‚Äôt be a black box. You should know what it knows, what it shares, and when to tell it to back off. No creepy vibes.

**Bottom line?**  
Chatbots aren‚Äôt just answering questions anymore. They‚Äôre shaping your routines. Making life smoother, more intuitive‚Äîeven more human.

**What would you actually trust an AI assistant to do for you every day?**

In-Depth Review Here,"The CASABREWS ULTRA Espresso Machine has been my daily coffee go-to for nearly a month now, and I‚Äôve definitely put it through its paces. As someone who thrives on caffeine and loves experimenting with coffee styles, this little marvel has been an exciting addition to my kitchen counter. Its sleek brushed stainless steel design caught my eye right out of the box, giving off a premium vibe that effortlessly blends into my monochromatic kitchen theme.

**User-Friendly LCD Display and Controls**  
Navigating around the espresso machine feels as intuitive as using my smartphone. The buttons are crisp, and the LCD display immediately draws you in with its clean design. From pre-programmed shot settings to options for hot water and steaming, everything is at your fingertips. I‚Äôve found the temperature adjustment feature particularly useful, thanks to its four distinct settings. Tailoring the brewing temperature to match your mood or bean blend is a satisfying tweaking adventure.  

[Check CASABREWS ULTRA Espresso Machine price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d53126xj/)  

**Powerful Performance and Crema Excellence**  
The heart of this machine, its 20-bar Italian pump, paired with the 1350W motor, means business. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting such a robust yet consistent espresso pull at this price range. Using freshly ground coffee, I‚Äôve managed to achieve that perfect coffee crema every barista dreams of replicating. Whether it's a bold shot of espresso or a creamy flat white loaded with frothy microfoam, this device delivers the goods.

**Steam Wand ‚Äì A Latte Art Revelation**  
The steam wand is more than a decorative addition ‚Äì it‚Äôs an actual game-changer. It spins milk liquor so easily that even my 12-year-old niece managed her first froth attempt under my watch (naturally, we cleaned the chaos afterward). The microfoam texture offered by the wand grants you the freedom to transform your artistic whims into cappuccino conversations. Latte art at home? Yes, please!

**Compact Build with Generous Features**  
Despite its compact dimensions (12.2""D x 10.31""W x 12.99""H), the espresso machine packs an incredible punch. It houses a generously sized 73 oz removable water tank. Refilling doesn‚Äôt feel like a tedious chore, and the space-saving design has even impressed my roommate who‚Äôs notorious for criticizing new gadgets.  

**Advantages of the CASABREWS Espresso Machine:**  
- Compact design with exceptional performance.  
- Adjustable brewing temperature that caters to various tastes.  
- Professional-grade steaming wand for perfect microfoam.  
- Easy button controls paired with LCD for a personalized brewing experience.  

**Critiques:**  
- Switching between brewing espresso and using the steam wand involves a brief waiting period.  
- Instructions for certain settings, like adjusting the espresso volume, could‚Äôve been more detailed.  
- It‚Äôs not the quietest machine, though I wouldn‚Äôt call it bothersome. 

**Rival Brands and Where the Machine Shines**  
In comparison to other espresso machines like the Breville Bambino or the De'Longhi Dedica EC685, the CASABREWS ULTRA holds its ground quite commendably. While the competitors might boast faster heat-up times, they often compromise when it comes to tank size or ease of cleaning. The CASABREWS espresso maker excels with its generous water capacity, beginner-friendly design, and customizable temperature options. It‚Äôs evident that this machine aims to provide a barista-level experience without breaking the bank.  

**Value for Money**  
Considering the rich array of features packed into this device, it definitely shines in terms of cost-effectiveness.

1k7l1xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1k7l1xc/fare_evasion_explanation_for_transplants/,Fare evasion explanation for transplants,"I see a lot of people complaining about fare evasion here and it‚Äôs clear you are not from here. Allow me to explain/clarify. When you grow up in the area you do not have to pay for the metro before the age of 18, a lot of people don‚Äôt feel that all of sudden because they are 18+ they need to pay when they haven‚Äôt paid most of their life.

 Next, a lot of people use the metro to get to and from work, the price goes during commute times to a ridiculous $6.25. Let me do the math for you, that‚Äôs $62.50/week just to get to and from work. Not every one works for the government or a NGO or consulting firm that pays them a lot or subsidizes their costs. The person working at the coffee shop you get your latte at every morning making $18/hour paying $1000-$1800 in rent can‚Äôt afford $62 a week. I work a pretty good job, I however could not afford $62 a week, I already gave up my car/ubering and take my bike or walk as many places as I can. I make more now and changed my schedule so I am not traveling during peak hours, so now I pay. 

Lastly, we live in one of the most educated areas in probably the world so I am assuming we all understand how capitalism works. WMATA is no different, they MADE plenty of money last year and straight up said ‚Äúwe need more‚Äù. The price will always go up just like the price of everything else, CAPITALISM BABY!! Other people paying or you turning into some type of citizen police is not going to make the price go down, it will still go up! 


Long story long: Others fare evasion affects you almost none. Kudos to you for having and being willing to pay every time. Sorry if someone gets a little close to you to get through. It‚Äôs public transportation, you‚Äôre going to have people close and breathing on you regardless. Please get over it and stop complaining on here about. Or here‚Äôs a thought, move back to your home where apparently fare evasion is not a thing. Hope this helps. Have a good day! ",0,1745588011.0,washingtondc,50,0.13,False

Looking for something real, no rush, no pressure. Whether it becomes a relationship or a solid friendship, I‚Äôm all for deep connections built on trust and presence. Real talk, good vibes, and meaningful moments.

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life‚Äôs intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There‚Äôs magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you‚Äôre into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I‚Äôm also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I‚Äôm looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn‚Äôt mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you‚Äôre someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

If something here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one random thing that made today a little brighter for you.

I was exactly where you are right now‚Äîtired of the hassle, the costs, and the uncertainty. But then I discovered the **Aqua Tower**, and I can confidently say it‚Äôs one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made for my health, convenience, and peace of mind.

Let me walk you through my experience and why the Aqua Tower isn‚Äôt just another water filtration system‚Äîit‚Äôs a complete lifestyle upgrade.

# üßä My Water Woes Before Aqua Tower

For years, I relied on plastic water bottles, pitcher filters, and tap water I wasn‚Äôt sure I could trust. Each of these had serious problems:

* **Plastic bottles?** Expensive, bad for the environment, and heavy to carry home.
* **Pitcher filters?** Slow, small-capacity, and needed frequent filter changes.
* **Tap water?** Who really knows what‚Äôs in it? The chlorine smell alone was enough to put me off.

I was frustrated. I wanted something that was easy to use, reliable, eco-friendly, and most importantly‚Äî**actually purified my water effectively**.

# üíß Discovering the Aqua Tower

I first stumbled upon the Aqua Tower while searching for a sleek, powerful water purification system that wouldn‚Äôt take up my whole kitchen. The product page claimed it could:

* Remove 99.99% of contaminants (including heavy metals, chlorine, bacteria, and microplastics)
* Store up to several gallons at once
* Require minimal maintenance
* Deliver water that tastes **better than bottled**

At first, I was skeptical. It almost sounded *too* good. But after reading hundreds of glowing reviews, I decided to give it a shot. And I‚Äôm so glad I did.

# üöÄ First Impressions ‚Äì Sleek, Smart, and Super Easy

The Aqua Tower arrived quickly and was packaged with care. Right out of the box, I could tell this wasn‚Äôt your average water filter. It had a **premium, minimalist design**‚Äîclean lines, stainless steel body, and a modern spout that fit perfectly on my kitchen counter. It looked like something out of a high-end showroom.

Setting it up? A breeze. No plumbing, no tools, no technician needed. Just assemble the parts (took me less than 10 minutes), fill it up with tap water, and let it work its magic.

# üî¨ What Makes the Aqua Tower So Powerful?

This isn‚Äôt just a basic carbon filter. The Aqua Tower uses **multi-stage filtration technology**, including:

* **Sediment filtration**: Removes rust, dirt, and larger particles.
* **Activated carbon block**: Eliminates chlorine, bad odors, and taste.
* **Ultra-filtration membrane**: Traps bacteria, viruses, and microplastics.
* **Mineral booster**: Adds essential minerals for great-tasting, healthier water.

The result? Water so clean, so crisp, and so refreshing‚Äîit honestly made me question what I had been drinking all these years.

And here's the part that sealed the deal: **lab-tested and certified filtration performance**. This thing isn't guessing‚Äîit‚Äôs delivering **purified, mineral-rich water with precision.**

# üåç Eco-Friendly & Budget-Saving

Before Aqua Tower, I was spending roughly $60/month on bottled water. That‚Äôs over $700 a year‚Äî*just on water*. Now? I get clean, fresh, filtered water on demand. No more hauling bottles, no more waste, and no more guilt about contributing to plastic pollution.

Plus, the Aqua Tower‚Äôs filters last for **months**, and replacements are surprisingly affordable.

If you care about the planet‚Äîor just saving your hard-earned money‚Äîthis system is a no-brainer.

# üß† Health Benefits I Didn‚Äôt Expect

Since switching to Aqua Tower water, I‚Äôve noticed:

* **Better hydration** (the water tastes so good, I drink more without even thinking about it)
* **Clearer skin** (less exposure to toxins = fewer breakouts)
* **More energy** (hydration is the #1 secret weapon for boosting energy levels)

Even my plants and pets seem to love it. And when friends come over, they *always* comment on how amazing the water tastes.

# üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Safe for the Whole Family

I have young kids, and I‚Äôm always thinking about their safety. With the Aqua Tower, I don‚Äôt have to worry about lead, chlorine, or bacteria in our water. It‚Äôs a relief knowing I‚Äôm giving them the best, without the stress or ongoing cost.

You can even use Aqua Tower water for cooking, coffee, tea, and even for your pets. It‚Äôs truly an **all-in-one solution** for every drop of water in your home.

# üí° Small Details That Make a Big Difference

* **Large capacity**: Holds enough water for the whole day, even with multiple people using it.
* **No electricity required**: Works even during power outages.
* **Low maintenance**: Just clean and replace the filter every few months.
* **Drip-free spout**: Zero mess. Every. Single. Time.

# üèÜ My Honest Verdict ‚Äì Worth Every Penny

The Aqua Tower isn‚Äôt just a product‚Äîit‚Äôs peace of mind in a stainless steel shell. It‚Äôs the kind of investment that keeps paying you back in the form of better health, convenience, and confidence in every glass of water you drink.

It‚Äôs helped me:

* Drink more water daily
* Save money monthly
* Reduce plastic waste
* Feel in control of my family‚Äôs health

If you‚Äôre on the fence, let me be the voice that pushes you over. I wish I had bought this years ago. It‚Äôs more than a filter‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle improvement you‚Äôll feel **every single day.**

I met Kevin (38M) last April while I was still in a different relationship. When that relationship ended Kevin immediately started pursing me. At the time I wasn‚Äôt aware but he was also aggressively pursuing my two best friends (32F and 24F) as well. Which caused a rift in our friendship that only go better after he and I had broke up. 

By June/late May  of last year Kevin and I were basically in a relationship. We‚Äôd select what events we were going to go to together, he‚Äôd basically never leave my side. He would bombard me with compliments and attention. We were dating for a few months when he suddenly got really cold, and started making weird comments during date nights. Ex. We were watching a comedy special and the comedian made a joke about it not being smart to date ‚Äú10s‚Äù because they‚Äôre all crazy, Kevin said ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs why me and my ex wife aren‚Äôt together she‚Äôs a total 10‚Äù. (For reference his ex wife is about 5‚Äô4‚Äù, Blonde, and very thin. Me and this newer friend/acquaintance are a little taller, brunette/multi colored hair, on the curvier/more plus side) I brought up doing this thing I had read about ‚Äú25 questions to fall in love‚Äù it‚Äôs basically just like intense get to know you stuff, and the psychologist that wrote it theorized that you only needed to know the answers to those questions to fall in love with someone. He got really weird about it. He‚Äôd also get mad if I was talking to anyone else (entirely platonically) at events but would get weird when I called him my boyfriend around our mutual friends. 

He called me in mid August to meet for dinner after work, and said ‚ÄúI think we should discuss if we both still want this‚Äù right when I showed up. We talked through dinner and I thought had assuaged any issues (we had planned out things to go to for the rest of September, we planned a day to go to the Ren Fest together) so after dinner when he invited me back to his for sex I was all for it. I went home that night and he texted me at 6am the next day saying that we needed to break up. When I asked for clarification he basically spent the next hour telling me all the reasons he thought I was the last person he‚Äôd ever fall in love with. He listed that he hated kissing me, that he didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd ever be able to get past our age difference, that I was clingy and needed to be reassured all the time, and basically implied that he had never actually been attracted to me because of how I looked (heavily implied that he thought I was fat), he also admitted that he had felt that way the evening before but he just wanted sex so he told me whatever he thought would get him that. 

Most of our mutual friends ended up kinda cutting him off, not through my suggestion, but just at their own decision when they got the situation explained to them. He ended up basically getting kicked out of our mutual friends D&D campaign we were both in. 

He basically didn‚Äôt come to any events in the singles group for months. I didn‚Äôt see him at an event until January of this year. We both just kept our distance. 

This is where my newer friend/acquaintance comes in. We can call her Amanda (26 F). Amanda joined the singles group in late February/Early March. We met at one of her first events and hit it off due to our similarities(one of our friends joked that we could be sisters). We ended up planning to go to another event together, and hung out there .we made semi-plans to get a coffee or see what events the other was planning to go to when I returned from a trip at the beginning of April. I was out of the country for two weeks until mid-April, and then ended up catching a fairly bad cold on my way back so I didn‚Äôt end up going to another event until this last weekend. I got there and saw Amanda on the couch and was excited to see her until I saw that Kevin was seated next to her with his arm around her. One of my best friends was also there and she immediately saw where I was looking and said ‚Äúoh yeah, that‚Äôs a thing now‚Äù. I guess while I had been gone they met at an event and Kevin basically had been doing to her exactly what he did to start our relationship. 

I‚Äôm struggling because on the one hand Amanda is an adult and she can make her own choices about who to date. But on the other hand if I just started talking to someone and someone I knew, knew some pretty awful history about that person, i‚Äôd want to know. 

I‚Äôd obviously never tell her to break up with him if it wasn‚Äôt her choice, but I also am feeling like if I don‚Äôt at least mention something to her I‚Äôd be a giant AH if this follows a similar path. 

TLDR: went on vacation, when i returned a friend I had just made before I left is dating my semi-abusive ex boyfriend. WIBTAH if I either just ignore it and let it play out or if I tell her and she breaks up with him? ",1,1745587891.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

In this review, I‚Äôm going to walk you through my entire journey, what makes ProDentim truly special, and why I believe this is a must-have for anyone who values their teeth, gums, and overall health.

# My Dental Struggles Before ProDentim

For years, I struggled with recurring dental issues. Every time I thought I was getting better, the problems came back‚Äîworse than before. My dentist told me my oral microbiome was probably imbalanced. I had no idea what that meant until I started researching it.

It turns out our mouths contain **billions of bacteria**, and not all of them are bad. In fact, good bacteria are essential to protect against inflammation, cavities, and gum disease. But thanks to modern diets, chemical-filled toothpaste, and antibiotics, most of us have wiped out the good bacteria along with the bad.

I realized the problem wasn‚Äôt my hygiene‚Äîit was my **oral microbiome**. That‚Äôs when I came across **ProDentim**.

# What Is ProDentim?

**ProDentim** is not your average dental supplement. It‚Äôs a unique blend of **3.5 billion probiotic strains** and natural ingredients that are clinically proven to support oral health from the inside out.

Unlike traditional dental care products that mask the symptoms, ProDentim tackles the root cause‚Äîan unbalanced mouth microbiome‚Äîby replenishing your mouth with the good bacteria it desperately needs.

# What Makes ProDentim So Powerful?

Here's what blew me away:

‚úÖ **Lactobacillus Paracasei** ‚Äì Supports gum health and keeps the sinuses clear.

‚úÖ **Lactobacillus Reuteri** ‚Äì Helps with inflammation and supports a balanced oral microbiome.

‚úÖ **BLIS M-18 and BLIS K-12** ‚Äì Two powerful strains that protect teeth and gums while improving breath freshness.

‚úÖ **Inulin** ‚Äì A prebiotic that feeds the good bacteria and supports digestive health too.

‚úÖ **Peppermint and Spearmint Extracts** ‚Äì Not just for fresh breath, but also for their anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects.

‚úÖ **Malic Acid** (from strawberries) ‚Äì Naturally helps whiten teeth and maintain healthy saliva.

It‚Äôs like an all-in-one super formula designed to restore balance to your mouth and keep your teeth, gums, and breath in top shape.

# My Results With ProDentim (And Why I‚Äôll Never Stop Taking It)

I was skeptical at first, but within **the first two weeks**, I noticed something different‚Äîmy mouth *felt* cleaner, even in the mornings. That nasty morning breath? Practically gone.

By **week four**, my gums had stopped bleeding during brushing. I was eating ice cream without wincing from sensitivity. Even my coffee stains started to fade a little‚Äîwithout any whitening treatments!

But here‚Äôs the real shocker: at my next dentist appointment, my hygienist told me my **gum pockets had reduced**, and there was **minimal plaque build-up.** She actually asked me what I was doing differently because she noticed a clear improvement in my oral health.

That‚Äôs when I knew‚ÄîProDentim works. Not just a little, but dramatically.

# The Unexpected Bonuses (That No One Talks About)

Here‚Äôs something I wasn‚Äôt expecting: my digestion improved too. Because ProDentim also contains strains that benefit your **gut microbiome**, I started feeling less bloated and more energized. It‚Äôs like my whole body was thanking me for finally supporting it the right way.

Also, I‚Äôm way more confident now. No more covering my mouth when I laugh or popping mints before meetings. My breath is fresh all day, and I smile without second thoughts.

# Why ProDentim Is Different From Everything Else

I‚Äôve tried dozens of toothpastes, mouthwashes, whitening kits, and even probiotic supplements before. Nothing worked like this.

Why?

Because most products only **treat the symptoms**‚Äîthey don‚Äôt address the underlying bacterial imbalance. And oral probiotic supplements? Most don‚Äôt contain enough CFUs or the right strains to be effective.

**ProDentim is formulated specifically for oral health**, not just gut health, and every chewable tablet contains billions of CFUs with clinical backing.

# How to Take It?

It‚Äôs super easy‚Äîjust **chew one tablet every morning**, preferably before brushing. That‚Äôs it.

No messy routines, no bad taste (it‚Äôs minty fresh!), and no pills to swallow.

# Is ProDentim Safe?

Absolutely. It‚Äôs made in an **FDA-approved facility**, is **non-GMO**, **gluten-free**, and contains **zero stimulants** or harsh chemicals.

Plus, it‚Äôs backed by a **100% satisfaction guarantee**, which gave me the confidence to try it in the first place.

# Should You Try ProDentim?

Let me put it this way: **if you care about your teeth, gums, and breath, you need this in your life.**

Whether you‚Äôre battling gum disease, bad breath, sensitive teeth, or just want to protect your smile as you age‚ÄîProDentim delivers real, noticeable results.

I only wish I had discovered it sooner.

# Final Verdict: Life-Changing Oral Health Support You Can‚Äôt Afford to Miss

Since taking ProDentim, my dental visits have become stress-free, my breath is fresh 24/7, my gums are healthier than ever, and I‚Äôm no longer paranoid about cavities or tooth decay.

This is not a band-aid solution. It‚Äôs a game-changing innovation that restores your mouth‚Äôs natural ecosystem‚Äîand it WORKS.

If you‚Äôve been let down by toothpastes, mouthwashes, or even dental treatments that only offer temporary relief, it‚Äôs time to do something different.

Do yourself a favor and try **ProDentim** today. Your teeth (and your dentist!) will thank you.

Here‚Äôs something I wasn‚Äôt expecting: my digestion improved too. Because ProDentim also contains strains that benefit your **gut microbiome**, I started feeling less bloated and more energized. It‚Äôs like my whole body was thanking me for finally supporting it the right way.

Also, I‚Äôm way more confident now. No more covering my mouth when I laugh or popping mints before meetings. My breath is fresh all day, and I smile without second thoughts.

# Why ProDentim Is Different From Everything Else

I‚Äôve tried dozens of toothpastes, mouthwashes, whitening kits, and even probiotic supplements before. Nothing worked like this.

Why?

Because most products only **treat the symptoms**‚Äîthey don‚Äôt address the underlying bacterial imbalance. And oral probiotic supplements? Most don‚Äôt contain enough CFUs or the right strains to be effective.

**ProDentim is formulated specifically for oral health**, not just gut health, and every chewable tablet contains billions of CFUs with clinical backing.

# How to Take It?

It‚Äôs super easy‚Äîjust **chew one tablet every morning**, preferably before brushing. That‚Äôs it.

No messy routines, no bad taste (it‚Äôs minty fresh!), and no pills to swallow.

# Is ProDentim Safe?

Absolutely. It‚Äôs made in an **FDA-approved facility**, is **non-GMO**, **gluten-free**, and contains **zero stimulants** or harsh chemicals.

Plus, it‚Äôs backed by a **100% satisfaction guarantee**, which gave me the confidence to try it in the first place.

# Should You Try ProDentim?

Let me put it this way: **if you care about your teeth, gums, and breath, you need this in your life.**

Whether you‚Äôre battling gum disease, bad breath, sensitive teeth, or just want to protect your smile as you age‚ÄîProDentim delivers real, noticeable results.

I only wish I had discovered it sooner.

# Final Verdict: Life-Changing Oral Health Support You Can‚Äôt Afford to Miss

Since taking ProDentim, my dental visits have become stress-free, my breath is fresh 24/7, my gums are healthier than ever, and I‚Äôm no longer paranoid about cavities or tooth decay.

This is not a band-aid solution. It‚Äôs a game-changing innovation that restores your mouth‚Äôs natural ecosystem‚Äîand it WORKS.

If you‚Äôve been let down by toothpastes, mouthwashes, or even dental treatments that only offer temporary relief, it‚Äôs time to do something different.

Do yourself a favor and try **ProDentim** today. Your teeth (and your dentist!) will thank you.

Because what I discovered in MITOLYN not only shocked me, but it also transformed my life in ways I didn‚Äôt think were possible at my age.

This isn‚Äôt your typical supplement hype. I‚Äôve tried dozens ‚Äî maybe even hundreds ‚Äî of so-called miracle supplements. But MITOLYN is the **first product that actually delivered results I could feel**, and more importantly‚Ä¶ **see**.

# üëµ From Drained and Foggy‚Ä¶ to Energized and Alive!

Let me back up a bit. I‚Äôm a 52-year-old woman, and for the past few years, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve been **slowly deteriorating**. I couldn‚Äôt concentrate like I used to. I was forgetting names, walking into rooms without knowing why, and worst of all‚Ä¶ my energy was **completely shot**.

No matter how many hours I slept, I woke up **exhausted**. My joints were stiff. My skin was dull. And my moods? Let‚Äôs just say they were not very ‚Äúfun to be around.‚Äù

I thought it was just a part of aging ‚Äî that this was my ‚Äúnew normal.‚Äù But I wasn‚Äôt ready to accept that.

Then I stumbled upon MITOLYN.

# ‚ö° What is MITOLYN and Why is Everyone Talking About It?

MITOLYN is not your average supplement. It‚Äôs **backed by mitochondrial science**, which is something I had never even heard of before trying it.

Here‚Äôs the deal: Your **mitochondria** are the tiny ‚Äúenergy engines‚Äù inside every cell of your body. They‚Äôre what keep your **brain sharp**, your **body energized**, your **heart beating strongly**, and your **skin looking youthful**. But as we age, these engines slow down‚Ä¶ or worse, break down entirely.

MITOLYN‚Äôs formula is designed to **reignite and restore** those mitochondria ‚Äî helping your body generate energy like it did **when you were in your 20s**.

Think of it like this: If your body was a phone, MITOLYN is the **supercharged battery replacement** you desperately needed.

# üî¨ The Ingredients? Absolutely Cutting-Edge

What impressed me most about MITOLYN was its **scientific formulation**. This isn‚Äôt just a blend of random herbs. It‚Äôs packed with **clinically supported ingredients** like:

* **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)** ‚Äì Helps your body create brand-new mitochondria. (Yes, *new* ones!)
* **CoQ10** ‚Äì Boosts existing mitochondrial energy and improves heart and brain function.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** ‚Äì Helps your body convert fat into energy and clears out cellular waste.
* **Resveratrol** ‚Äì A powerful anti-aging compound that supports cellular health and longevity.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** ‚Äì A potent antioxidant that improves insulin sensitivity and protects mitochondria.

These ingredients aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential if you want to **take control of aging** at the cellular level.

# üí• The MITOLYN Effect: My Real Results

**By week two**, my energy levels were through the roof. I no longer needed that 3pm coffee crash. I felt like someone had switched on my internal power generator.

**In one month**, I noticed visible changes. My skin looked **fresher**, my eyes brighter, and I wasn‚Äôt snapping at my family over the smallest things. My **joint discomfort decreased**, and I even started going on evening walks again ‚Äî something I hadn‚Äôt done in years.

My husband even asked if I was doing something new because I was ‚Äúglowing.‚Äù That was the moment I knew MITOLYN wasn‚Äôt just working‚Ä¶ **it was transforming me**.

1k7kx3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/LettersToYourself/comments/1k7kx3n/beneath_our_marrow/,Beneath our marrow,"Dear Me,

I woke up from a night terror. I'm not alone in this moment - I'm with myself, and there are things inside me that need to be expressed.

In my dream, I connected the pain of my recent breakup with my father's abandonment after the divorce. I see now that my father's disappearance wasn't about me being unlovable - it was about his own attachment issues. He dotted on me while abusing my siblings, yet there was still profound neglect. He treated me as ""perfect"" while I was malnourished.

He vanished from my life overnight after the divorce. He never fought for me. I never talk about this pain because it's overshadowed by ""bigger"" traumas, but it matters. I remember crying for days, begging to see him or talk to him. And he continues this pattern of abandonment even now that I'm an adult. It still hurts.

I worry constantly that I've inherited his lack of empathy. He was deeply troubled - displaying BPD-like behaviors when I was only four years old. My first memory is him holding a knife to my mother's throat, threatening us. I don't even remember what he wanted.

How could anyone want someone as traumatized as me? Now that I understand trauma doesn't simply disappear, how can I ever be happy? I struggle to believe my ex when she said I was a good partner. 

Too much damage has been done to me to believe I'm truly kind and compassionate. I feel like something is fundamentally wrong inside me - like my trauma writhes beneath my skin, through my bones and marrow, an alarming dance signaling danger.

I don't want to trap others with my pain. But I don't want to carry it alone either. I've lived in darkness for so long. Let me bring this into the light.

My parents blame each other, but neither of them did the work to heal - not for anyone, not even themselves. My chest aches thinking about it. But if their demons are writhing inside me, perhaps I can find peace in knowing that I'm aware of them.

Still, I fear getting close to people. I don't think I can choose someone as good for me as she was. This wound feels necessary - like keeping it open somehow protects everyone I love from me.

Under these fears is a voice I've long ignored - my inner child. Part of me wants to silence her, to make her understand the danger. But she doesn't want to be hidden away. She wants to cry. She wants to be held and taken somewhere soft. Not necessarily somewhere she's loved, just somewhere that doesn't hurt. Somewhere her needs aren't dangerous to express. Somewhere affection isn't met with disdain or indifference. She wants someone to lift her up and show her what they see.

Jason did that for me. She did too. They probably didn't understand what it meant to me - to share their perspective, their culture, to have someone make me coffee. These moments of vulnerability from others were all I ever wanted - to be told it was okay, to truly understand another person.

Sex has been my crutch. What I truly want is connection. Can I get close to people as friends? Part of me still says: please don't find anything precious in me. Everyone who ever thought I was special eventually left, never got truly close, never felt safe.

I'm realizing now that I might struggle with being loved because love has never felt safe to receive.  That's why I prefer relationships that are sexual but not too intimate - it feels safer than friendship. But my relationship with Jason feels safe precisely because it's not overtly sexual, just flirtatious. In that space, I feel he won't drop me. And he tells me what's good about me, about who I am. I need that.

I want to grow. I'm going to sit with myself, get myself water, and caress my inner child's hair as she cries. I'll smile at her. My ex was the only person I wasn't afraid to smile at while she cried. I hope it made her feel safe.

I can hold myself. I can learn to make good connections. Maybe someday I can share this pain wordlessly by lying on someone, and they'll understand. They'll trace my spine with their fingers and whisper that I'm not alone. And I truly won't be, because I'll have them.

With compassion for all my wounds,

**June 16**

The doorbell chimes and it starts as a regular but sort of gives an enlightened vibe to it. What do I mean?¬† I can‚Äôt quite explain it. I have heard it once before.¬† This chime is strange. I should look into it.

*Dafuq?¬† It is Cindy‚Ä¶*

Cindy is hard to explain. Slim with some nice curves that dresses to maximize the effect she has when her 5‚Äô3‚Äù frame moves.¬† I have only seen her in blue jeans once, and we were moving Jackie out of the dorms. Today she is wearing a green knee length skirt, comfy looking boots, and a blue-green top that looks both comfy and cool. Considering the temp today, it works.

‚ÄúHey Pat, um‚Ä¶Grande Caf√© Mocha.‚Äù¬† She smiles.¬† I smile back and ask if she wants anything to eat. She nods and gets a cookie. After paying, I gave her my discount, she goes to the end, and I smile. Jackie is pulling her drink and when she saw the name she glanced up for a second before smiling and beginning to giggle.

‚ÄúOrder for a gorgeous babe!‚Äù¬† Cindy looks up and laughs.¬† She grabs her drink and sits down. She is at a table and Todd is across from her on his laptop. He looks up and‚Ä¶ sniffs.

Getting up, Todd walks over to her and my curiosity is now absolutely piqued.

‚ÄúHey, are you dating Jackie?‚Äù¬† His question is kind of weird as in, how would he know.

‚ÄúYea, how did you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe talks about her girlfriend Cindy.¬† You match her descriptions, and that call was pretty flirty.‚Äù¬† His logic is impeccable. Good job covering for yourself, buddy. Proud of you.

‚ÄúAlso, you both smell like the other one on your hands and lips so I am pretty sure you had sex with each other this morning.‚Äù

And you ruined that... Wait, trolls have that good of a sense of smell?

Cindy has generated new colors in the red end of the color spectrum and is just staring at Todd like she isn‚Äôt sure if stabbing him or running from him is the best option.

The fucker smiles and shows his real teeth. She turns white. FUCK!!

I get next to her before she can completely freak out. ‚ÄúTodd, did you just break a rule?‚Äù¬† He goes white as well.

‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt know?‚Äù¬† I see him trying to process how to fix this. He is coming up blank.

‚ÄúI am going on break!‚Äù¬† I grab Cindy‚Äôs hand and Todd‚Äôs and start walking to the back office. I have a couch there for crashing on along with my office chair. I sit Todd on the chair and Cindy on the couch. The couch is closer to the door. I want her to feel like she has an escape route.

‚ÄúCindy, darling, how much has‚Ä¶‚Äù. Jackie walks into the room.¬†

‚ÄúPat, I haven‚Äôt told her anything about the irregulars.‚Äù

Cindy looks at us. ‚ÄúIrregulars?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, we have a group of regulars that are anything but. This is Todd. He is a troll. Like, lives under a bridge and eats people troll.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, I haven‚Äôt eaten anyone in 35 years. I got my coin last month.‚Äù

‚ÄúDammit Todd, I can‚Äôt tell if you are joking or actually have a coin‚Ä¶‚Äù

He laughs and deadpans ‚Äúand you never will.‚Äù

Cindy actually laughs at this. ‚ÄúThis explains a lot. Jackie is fucking fearless. Like almost reckless sometimes. And you, you are like a force of nature. I guess facing guests that are sometimes from horror stories does that.¬† I have so many questions‚Ä¶ Can you tell me more when I come to your place tonight?‚Äù

I nod. Jackie hugs her.

I look at Todd. ‚ÄúYou get this one warning. Don‚Äôt assume people are enlightened.¬† Assume they are not. Even if they are our friends. The chimes normally tell you what a person is and hers wasn‚Äôt enlightened until the very end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Jackie whispers, ‚ÄúHoly fuck.‚Äù

He nods and looks at Cindy. ‚ÄúI am very sorry for scaring you. I was just trying to have some fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is okay, now if you will all excuse me, I need to wash my hands and chew some gum before I leave. You should too Jackie.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

My laughter follows Cindy out the door as she struts like she wasn‚Äôt just fearing for her life less than 5 minutes ago. Resilience of a marble slab, that one.

Jackie sniffs her hand. She looks at Todd.¬† ‚ÄúExplain. Now!‚Äù

As I start to walk out, I hear a desperate ‚ÄúPat please don‚Äôt abandon me!!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou dug yourself this hole. Enjoy the consequences of your actions.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe can actually kill me‚Ä¶‚Äù

I laugh as I get to the door. ‚ÄúYou are a tough kid and Trolls regenerate, right?‚Äù

As the door closes, I hear a whispered ‚Äúnot against fire.‚Äù

¬†

**June 19**

Pat walks in behind a group of dock workers.¬† I wave at her.¬† She is wearing a similar uniform to them.¬†¬† They all order their drinks and I get her the usual.¬†

‚ÄúYou work at the docks with a bunch of guys?‚Äù¬† I am eyeing them in a protective big sister manner.¬†

Pat laughs.¬† And nods.¬† ‚ÄúI am the best swimmer of the bunch, a safety inspector, and do some of the underwater stuff that you don‚Äôt need to be able to be strong¬† but do need to be able to hold your breath for a while.‚Äù¬† She winks at me and I almost lose my composure.¬†

She then looks at me.¬† ‚ÄúI also work as a lifeguard in the summer, and Swim instructor at a few places.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you sleep?‚Äù¬† I know I look concerned.

She shrugs.¬† ‚ÄúNot among my line. Half my brain goes into a sleeping mode for 3 hours or so. While that happens, the other half is in charge.¬† I lose some motor and speech functions.‚Äù

I recall her mumbling a few times and being klutzy.

‚ÄúI also like working with lots of people.¬† I have learned so much.¬† Though I do need to keep my distance from these men as some of them are‚Ä¶ less than chaste.‚Äù¬† She smiles and I want to protect this girl so much.¬†

‚ÄúIf you need something, ask.¬† Friends don‚Äôt need favors to help each other.‚Äù

She nods as if I have lifted a huge weight from her shoulders.

¬†

**June 22**

Blake walks in.¬† John is working at the counter and gets the order for her.¬† He asks for the name and Blake just stares daggers at him.¬† As do I.¬†  
‚ÄúREPHRASE. NOW!‚Äù He realizes his mistake and nods.¬† He seems a little distracted by her. She is very pretty, in a thin and almost boyish way.¬† Androgyny seems to be a Merfolk trait.¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúSorry, what should we call out?‚Äù

Blake smiles, and even my blood gets a little cold.¬† Her eyes are all black, like a shark.¬† ‚ÄúDo remember it is Blake, John.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, crap, I am sorry.¬† I am not anywhere near as good as the boss at this sort of thing.‚Äù¬† He nods to himself, and I almost believe him.

Grey walks in. He‚Äôs wearing his usual Dark grey cat eared hoodie which I always compliment his taste on.¬† His baggy jeans and boots are pretty much a uniform for him.¬†

‚ÄúHey John, Hot Chocolate, Birthday Cake Pop for Grey.‚Äù¬† He smiles and gets his card ready for the reader.¬† John nods and puts the order in.

 ‚ÄúWeird, that‚Äôs what the other Grey ordered when she was last in here.‚Äù¬† He chuckles and Grey does too.¬† ‚ÄúSure, sure, this other Grey that I have never met and is also a merfolk.¬† Yea, pal.‚Äù

John laughs.¬† ‚ÄúI swear she exists, man.‚Äù¬† This has been a running joke between them for months.¬† Blake interrupts.

 ‚ÄúGrey!!!¬† I did it, I got my project working on 2 different families!‚Äù¬† Grey looks surprised.¬† And I am now curious.¬† Fae projects tend to be long-term things, even for the ones that aren‚Äôt as long lived as millennia.¬†

‚ÄúFar out, you actually taught more than one octopus to teach their kids things they know?¬† Wow, that is awesome.‚Äù

I must jump in.¬† ‚ÄúHold up.¬† You did WHAT?‚Äù

Blake looks at me and smiles.¬† ‚ÄúI thought it was sad that every octopus has to learn everything from scratch because they don‚Äôt have ways of teaching their kids what they learned.¬† I started showing them how to do things that they wouldn‚Äôt learn right away and then showed it to their kids while they were there.¬† It took over a decade, but the 4^(th) generation is now starting to teach their kids how to do stuff right away, so they don‚Äôt have to figure it out.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou have doomed us all.¬† You bestowed generational learning to Octopuses‚Ä¶¬† They will have nuclear fusion figured out in 100 years or less and will rise up and take over the world‚Ä¶‚Äù

Blake laughs and then stops when she sees the very real horror on my face.¬†

‚ÄúYou are joking, right?‚Äù

 I shake my head.¬† ‚ÄúA creature that lives 3-5 years in most cases is a short-lived creature.¬† One that can solve puzzles that make human adults perplexed that only lives that long is a genius.¬† They learn everything for themselves and still manage in such a short time and with such a huge handicap to get on par with some adults for how well they use tools while being in an environment where tools are in short supply.¬† And you are showing them how to take 3 years of learning and hand it off to their children so they can play catch up to humanity‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe this wasn‚Äôt such a good idea?‚Äù¬† She seems worried.¬† Grey is just looking at us in shock.¬† He nods.

 I sigh.¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just hope it doesn‚Äôt spread.¬† And please, don‚Äôt put any waterproof physics books or matches near their lairs.‚Äù¬† We all laugh at that.¬† Somewhere out there, a 2-month-old octopus is learning how to pick a lock and plotting‚Ä¶

¬†

**June 24**

May, Lemar, Cindy, Jackie, Ricardo, and I are on a group date in Central Park.¬† This is giving me an opportunity to see how May and Lemar are together.¬† So far, I am hoping they get the chance to be parents together because that home would be full of love.¬† May and Lemar are so adorable together it is almost capable of giving cavities from the concentration of sweetness‚Ä¶¬†

After a fun time walking, we take a ride on the Carousel. I haven‚Äôt been on one of these in over 15 years. This is more fun than I thought it would be. Ricardo and I sit in one of the carts.¬† I lean against him.¬† This is a wonderful time.¬† Cindy and Jackie are riding horses next to one another and laughing.¬† Just people enjoying being together.¬†

We head out to Bow Bridge.¬† Because of course we have to get pictures here.¬† I have lived in this city 6 years, this will be my first time there.¬† Watching Lemar and May walking hand in hand I am almost a little jealous. They are obviously in love. It is so amazing.

Ricardo and I are holding hands.¬† It is nice.¬† He quickly turns to tell me something and I flinch.¬† He notices.¬† I apologize.¬† ‚ÄúI guess getting robbed a little while ago still has me on edge.‚Äù¬† He nods and asks for a hug I gladly give.¬† He is such a great guy.¬† *Don‚Äôt let him know. He is not Mike. He is so much better than him. Never once raised his hand at me‚Ä¶*

Jackie pulls Cindy in for a hug and they share a moment.¬† They laugh.¬† We end our trip with a hot dog vendor.¬† Cindy walks up to us.¬† ‚ÄúWhat you two plan on doing next?‚Äù

We both smile and point at the other.¬† I add an eyebrow waggle for comedic effect.¬† She laughs and then gets a very serious look on her face.¬† She reaches up and uses her finger to wipe off some mustard from his lower lip.¬† She licks her finger after.¬† *Tease!*

 Jackie walks up.¬† ‚ÄúQuit flirting with the stud muffin.‚Äù¬† She laughs.¬† Cindy shakes her head.¬† ‚ÄúHe had some mustard on his chin!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd you licked it off your finger why?‚Äù¬† Jackie winks at her.¬†

Cindy gets a very serious 6 year old kid vibe as she says ‚ÄúI like mustard.‚Äù¬† All she needs is a foot stomp to complete the look.

May walks up and signs to me.¬† ‚ÄúHeading out, thanks for the invite and the fun times.¬† And thanks for that exception to rule 3.‚Äù

I respond in ASL to her, ‚ÄúYou are the reason the exception exists.¬† Thank you for being amazing.‚Äù

I get a hug that is far too warm and loving to be from anything but a good person.¬†



¬†

¬†**July 1**

Board game night!¬† So far, we have 2 party games and 2 euro games to choose from.¬† Ricardo wants us to try King of Tokyo.¬† He explains the rules and I am left with ‚ÄúYahtzee with monsters and extra stuff.‚Äù¬† I can handle that.¬† We play for a bit and my robotic rabbit gets the crap kicked out of him.¬† I giggle as Jackie‚Äôs King Kong wannabe is absolutely crushed by Cindy‚Äôs Godzilla stunt double.¬† We go grab snacks while she and Ricardo trash talk each other for 10 minutes and finally his totally not Cthulu falls to her leaping lizard.¬† She literally gives it a card to give it wings so she keeps not taking damage and just outlasts the elder god.¬† I can‚Äôt hear much beyond the hilarity of their trash talk.¬†

 ‚ÄúThey get along.‚Äù¬† I lick my fingers as we get the last of the snacks ready.¬† This is fun.

Jackie nods and smiles.¬† ‚ÄúNice when you have a friend group.¬† I missed this sort of thing.‚Äù

We get to the table and a new game is selected.¬† We get the quick and dirty Carcasonne tutorial and we begin putting down tiles and little meeples.¬† I spend half the game in a war with Cindy trying to control a giant city we both have multiple meeples on that we keep adding them into.¬† Ricardo may as well be called the bricklayer as he is making roads like crazy.¬† Jackie finds her inner nun and actually has 3 of the church things on top of one another.¬† She completes all 3 and does really well.¬† I lost that city fight and my score is.. well, oh look, Ricardo wins!¬† There is a lot of laughing and some trash talk, but it is friendly.¬†

Now we go with a game of Joking Hazard.¬† Make a comic strip the judge will think is the best.¬† Everyone has 1-2 of the same panels, so you have to get the best punchline or set it up the best.¬† I CRUSH MY ENEMIES!!!!¬† Also, I find dark comedy works in this group and boy howdy do I go there.

Power Grid is up.¬† Ricardo thinks he has the advantage here.¬† We don‚Äôt bring out our box, as it looks beat up as hell.¬† Surprise, mother fucker‚Ä¶¬† Jackie takes a commanding lead because she is ridiculously good at this game and I want to say it is close, but not even I could stand before her domineering technological and financial might.¬† She is a business major, it sort of shows.¬† Cindy does really well for similar reasons.¬† Ricardo came in last on one of the games he owns‚Ä¶¬† whoops.

We laugh, eat, snuggle, and eventually we are all beat.¬† I tell everyone I have a night shift tomorrow and I have some errands.¬† Ricardo is more than okay with helping me stay warm in bed, so we take off.¬† I hear Jackie and Cindy start heading for their room.¬† A wave of jealousy hits me.¬† I think Cindy might like Ricardo.¬† Huh.

¬†

**August 2**

‚ÄúOrder for Fiadh.‚Äù¬† The red-headed and mute unseelie gets her drink and hurries back to continue to talk to May. Seeing two people that use ASL as their primary language is a riot. They move quickly and fluidly. Their conversation is pretty intense judging from their speed.

Lots of the irregulars and regulars, including Cindy, who has been coming here more and more, are watching them. I would say it is rude to listen in on other people‚Äôs conversations, but knowing ASL isn‚Äôt super common.

Lemar waits until things are a little more quiet before approaching me. ‚ÄúHey boss, that‚Ä¶ wow. I thought May and I talked fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúCrazy isn‚Äôt it?¬† They have been intense. Also, I think I almost saw Fiadh smile.‚Äù

He nods. ‚ÄúAny idea what sort of Fae she is?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo idea. She‚Äôs a little taller than me.¬† In older times she would have been considered unnaturally tall.¬† Always wears grey hoods, likes white and green too.¬† Has shocking red hair.¬† I know I have heard some stuff that sounds vaguely familiar in there.‚Äù¬† I know she is sad. And she isn‚Äôt liked. Those bug me. I can‚Äôt do much about them tho.

He pulls out his phone and opens a browser. Dude has a fairy mythology page open as the default page. Hahahaha. He has gotten searches down to a science at this point.

‚ÄúOkay, so tall, wears white or green along with grey, red hair, sad.¬† Let‚Äôs see what‚Ä¶ oh gods.‚Äù

The only thing that comes up as a possible match is Banshee.¬† Harbingers of death.¬† No wonder she believes she is unwelcome anywhere.

‚ÄúBoss, why has she been hanging out here more and more?‚Äù¬† He looks terrified.¬†

I really don‚Äôt want to know, but I feel like I need to go find out‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, excuse me.‚Äù

I walk over to them and begin to sign to Fiadh.

‚ÄúHi.¬† Can I ask something strange?‚Äù

She nods and looks up at me.

‚ÄúIs there a particular reason why you have been coming here more and more aside from the coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you know.‚Äù¬† She pauses and looks down.¬† I see her eyes get so sad.¬† ‚ÄúI get it, I can leave‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù¬† I say it aloud and several heads turn, she jumps in shock. My hand is out to stop her, she looks at me sadly, I continue in ASL.

‚ÄúI am not accusing, nor would I.¬† I know how some things work, and I just feel like if you are having a compulsion to come here, I may need to get things in order.‚Äù

She shakes her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know for whom, but I feel like it may be important that I be here before year‚Äôs end. I go where a death is significant and can change a path for many people. Even then, I am pretty sure it isn‚Äôt to cry for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand.¬† You are always welcome.¬† Do you understand me?¬† Always.‚Äù

She shakes her head. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt scared of or mad at me for being here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?¬† If this means someone is here to share my pain, I am thankful. Though I wish such a burden wasn‚Äôt always laid on such a kind person‚Äôs shoulders.‚Äù

‚ÄúKind?¬† Me?‚Äù

I switch to speaking and use my fingers for a list.¬†

‚ÄúYou could have gotten mad at the question. You didn‚Äôt.‚Äù¬†¬† One finger goes up.

‚ÄúYou could have told me to mind my business.¬† You didn‚Äôt.‚Äù¬† My second finger goes up.¬†

‚ÄúYour immediate reaction was to try and leave to stop discomfort instead of worrying about your own feelings.‚Äù¬† My third finger goes up.¬†

‚ÄúYou are talking to one of the kindest people I know, and she has nothing but good things to say about you.‚Äù Fourth finger up.¬†

‚ÄúI can see the pain in your eyes about this, even now.‚Äù My entire hand is up. I gesture it at her.

‚ÄúYou are fine.¬† Though I would ask one more question of you. I will even grant a minor favor for it.‚Äù

May gasps.

‚ÄúWhat is the question?‚Äù¬† She signs.

‚ÄúCan this person‚Äôs fate be denied?‚Äù

A single tear falls down her cheek.¬† ‚ÄúNot that I know of.‚Äù

I make a note of everyone that is working today. My biggest relief is that Jackie hasn‚Äôt interacted with this beautiful banshee even once. Still, I need to figure something out. I am not burying another friend.

**August 2**

Quite a few people on laptops today. I wonder if it is some tests or something. One of them is Todd. Now I am curious.

I sneak up and look over his shoulder. He has 4 different things showing on his monitor. One looks to be a chat, another a word doc he is typing like crazy in. The last two are a web browser with a gazillion tabs open and a video or stream of some sort.

‚ÄúRemember no porn in open view.‚Äù¬† I put my hands on his shoulders and he tenses for the briefest of moments at the surprise before relaxing immediately.¬† Huh. I guess he trusts me.

He laughs and switches to his chat tab to type something. ‚ÄúYes nee-chan!¬† As you can see, no porn. Just a collab with some other students for a project.¬† Got like an hour to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you just call me big sis?‚Äù¬† I have watched anime, I know that term.

He tries to whistle and kinda fails. Then he does a quick search because one of his chat members mention a term. As he is scanning it he finally tries to nonchalantly reply.¬† ‚ÄúI can not use it if you mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt think of making you stop. I know I am younger than you, but it is my honor to be your big sis, Todd, ai like you, are pretty awesome.‚Äù¬† He grins at me putting in that little jab.

At that moment I realize the little turd has had a video chat going this entire time and his group is all cheering. I can hear it through his headphones.¬† ‚ÄúDude, show me the video feed for them.‚Äù

7 college students are waving when their window comes up. I smile. He gives me one of the ear pieces so I can hear them, even though I don‚Äôt actually need it here.

‚ÄúAwww. You wuv Todd!!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHold up, her name tag says Boss Bitch.‚Äù His voice is full of joy.

‚ÄúThis is Pat isn‚Äôt it?!‚Äù¬† A woman‚Äôs voice. She sounds‚Ä¶ jealous?

‚ÄúHoly crap she‚Äôs real!!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen her at the shop a few times, y‚Äôall. I‚Äôve told ya.‚Äù

‚ÄúYea but I thought you were covering for him‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mention she was a hottie!‚Äù Wow, someone‚Äôs thirsty‚Ä¶

I shake my head and clap my hands. ‚ÄúYou all need to finish your project. Back on task!¬† And yes, it is Pat, I am real, and I am totally this cutie‚Äôs very hot big sis. I can see at least two ladies here.¬† And with my amazing Big Sis powers I can tell that at least one of you has your eye on him. Be good to him or else.‚Äù¬† I give a wink and hand him his earpiece. He is about 10 shades of red and smiling.

‚ÄúYou are absolutely evil, Pat!¬† Love ya nee-chan!‚Äù

I wave and walk back to the work area. As I do so I decide to listen in a little bit. I can hear a young lady in his earpiece ‚Äúwow, I better ask you on a date before I lose my chance to Jill.‚Äù

About 6 people start yelling as I stop listening. Better to let him keep that.

Before he leaves, he gives me a hug.¬† ‚ÄúBest big sis and wing man ever.‚Äù

I am pretty awesome.¬† Go me.

1k7kq0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1k7kq0v/how_do_i_stop_resenting_my_boyfriend_22f25m/,How do I stop resenting my boyfriend? [22F/25M],"I (22 F) met my current boyfriend (25 M) 8 months ago. We had an amazing first date, but the problems started quick. On our second date we went to a Jazz bar and he was looking across the room for a while, I tried to ignore it but he quickly started making comments about how he would choose the woman across the room to have a threesome for like the rest of the date, he also mentioned my best friend was hot after I showed him a picture of both of us on my birthday, which happened just a couple of days before I met him, I decided to not stay for too long and told him we should go shortly after that, and I refused to kiss him when he tried and mentioned I'd rather leave this there, he then started crying and told me he had never felt so comfortable with anyone in his life and took me for lunch the next day, when he asked me to be his girlfriend, and I said yes thinking it was a joke.

I do think it sounds incredibly stupid I kept seeing him after that, but I did. To that followed a bunch of similar incidents like looking at other girls, and then trying to silently apologise by holding my hand or kissing me, he would tell me a certain influencer had a sweet ass and I should start going to the gym to build one so he 'likes me more', he would usually speak about past sex experiences when we finished having sex too, and both of these things would happen constantly. My last straw was when he showed me he had private videos/pictures of girls he had been with before (nothing big, just underwear), and another girl's number saved and archived on whatsapp under the name¬†**her name, do not answer**¬†to which after like a month and a half of putting up with this behaviour, I left in the middle of a date and took a cab home. He came over, stayed outside of my house, begged me all night to come back, to which I did end up going back.

Since then, he has changed, but I can't help but get extremely angry and break up with him like once a week. It's been 8 months, it has become kind of serious but I have issues taking my clothes off during sex with him (he never tries either), he never calls me beautiful unless I externalise I feel bad lately, and I feel the ugliest I have ever felt in my entire life. Otherwise, he is super sweet and always goes the extra mile. He comes early in the morning to bring me coffee most days, gets me flowers like three times a week, plans nice dinners and trips and keeps mentioning he wants to marry me but it freaks me out because¬†**I don't trust him.**¬†I love him very much and enjoy my time with him, but I see it as a simple distraction most of the time as I am busy with other stuff, and I can't take that seriously someone that treated me like that from so early on. Every time I speak about this he says it's because he was taught that was a cool way to treat women??? and that he was trying to keep me by doing this????? and that he wasn't looking at the girls the way I thought he did, but he was doing it to make me notice he was. It sounds like complete bollocks to me, and I really can't get this man off my back, he follows me, emails me, calls my friends, and stands in front of my door for hours on end. He says I am the love of his life, and I do enjoy the good times I spend with him, I just don't understand this relationship and how to forgive him.  ",1,1745587105.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

1k7kpi8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k7kpi8,Zimaya Tiramisu Caramel and Coco,"Good evening guys!

I recently purchased the most awaited Zimaya Tiramisu Caramel and Coco. The detailed review is as follows:

Zimaya Tiramisu Caramel- I got this about two weeks ago and have been letting it sit for a bit, until I got my Coco. Coming to the review, on the first spray you get a burst of alcohol. The longer it sits, the sweeter and more delicious it becomes. After the alcohol burst, you would get a strong toffee caramel and then it matures into a beautiful vanilla+caramel combo that makes you wanna devour it. This is the perfume that would make strangers turn back and wonder, ""Damn he/she, smells like a walking candy shop"". One of the most beautiful gourmands I own. Have gotten a bunch of compliments for it already. This is a unisex, more feminine leaning perfume but everyone can rock it imho. 9/10.

Zimaya Tiramisu Coco- The first time I sprayed it on my wrist, I also got an alcohol blast but not as strong as most ME fragrances. It soon faded away into this beautiful Amaretto and then becomes this delicious mix of ice cream, vanilla and coffee. The coffee is on the lighter side so you will love it even if you are not a typical coffee enjoyer. This a head turner for sure and will be sure to get you compliments. This is also a strong unisex fragrance. Both men and women can rock it just like Caramel. This is definitely my favourite of the two. 10/10.


To sum it all up, this is a gourmand lover's fantasy. Both of these are safe blind buys if you are one. Got Caramel from Anirudh for 2000 and Coco from Malkeet for 2180 + shipping. Would love to hear your opinions.",3,1745587065.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,2,1.0,False
1k7kpho,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1k7kpho/what_makes_the_delta_children_jeep_aries_stroller/,What makes the Delta Children Jeep Aries stroller wagon bundle worth your attention? Review inside!,"The Delta Children Jeep Aries 2-Seater Stroller Wagon and 365 Plus Lightweight Stroller Bundle is an intriguing combination of functionality, comfort, and thoughtful design. Having used this product regularly over the past few weeks, I can confidently say that it‚Äôs one of the more versatile solutions for families constantly on the move. Juggling two kids can be chaos, but items like this have a way of taming that whirlwind. However, there are a few quirks worth highlighting alongside the many strengths of this stroller and wagon bundle.

**Versatility in Seating Arrangements**  
The defining feature of this two-seater stroller wagon is its flexibility. With five different seating configurations, it‚Äôs honestly a lifesaver for parents of two, especially those with kids of varying needs. My little one prefers sitting forward, relishing the view and being a mini ‚Äúnavigator,‚Äù while their older sibling opts for the backward-facing option to keep an eye (and maybe a little sass) on the parents. The outward-facing seats with convenient footrests have also been a hit for snack breaks at the park. When we needed the wagon for hauling toys and picnic gear instead, removing the seats made adjusting to our needs quick and seamless.  

[See Delta Children Jeep Aries 2-Seater Stroller Wagon and 365 Plus Lightweight Stroller Bundle deals on Amazon now.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0d2ccb55s/)

**Storage that Fits Everything**  
Let‚Äôs talk about storage‚Äîbecause as any parent knows, leaving the house with kids demands you pack half the house. This wagon is like Hermione‚Äôs magic bag with its zip-off storage pockets in the front and rear, under-seat compartments, and even a snack tray for the little ones. I tossed sunscreen, water bottles, diapers, snacks, and spare clothes into the various nooks without a problem. Plus, the parent cup holders were well-placed for my coffee. Having a removable canopy added another layer of convenience; it shielded us from the sun during our longer strolls, while the roll-down mesh screens allowed for decent airflow.

**Smooth Handling on All Terrains**  
I‚Äôve tried pushing some strollers that felt like wrangling a shopping cart with wonky wheels, so I appreciate the silky maneuverability of this product. The puncture-proof tires (7-inch in front and 10-inch in back) provided a smoother ride than expected, even on gravel and uneven park trails. Features like the shock-absorption system and one-step back brake allowed me to manage the wagon easily, even with two kids onboard and it loaded with bags. It didn‚Äôt hurt that the adjustable leatherette handles accommodated my height and my partner‚Äôs‚Äîno hunched-over pushing for anyone!

**Folding and Portability**  
The flat folding mechanism of the wagon took me a minute to master, but once I did, it became clear why reviewers love this feature. For an item weighing over 40 pounds (!), its compact fold made storage and transport manageable. It fit snugly in the back of my SUV next to our rambunctious golden retriever, and the lightweight Delta Children 365 Plus Stroller made short solo trips with my youngest a breeze. At 14.5 pounds, the stroller feels like picking up a feather compared to some bulkier designs.

**Benefits**  
- Five versatile seating options fit multiple family scenarios.  
- Comprehensive storage compartments and zip-off pockets.  
- Smooth ride with puncture-proof, shock-absorbing tires.  
- Lightweight stroller component ideal for quick errands.  

**Flaws**  
- Although the wagon folds flat, lifting its hefty 47 pounds into the car trunk can be a struggle.  
- Lack of included accessories, such as a rain cover or padded seat cushions, expected at this price.

**Competitive Options**  
Stacking this combo up against similar products was fascinating. Compared to the Evenflo Pivot Xplore, this Delta Children set pulls ahead with its additional stroller component. The Evenflo model, however, slightly edges out on tire durability and better stock accessories. Meanwhile, products like the Veer Cruiser offer a more premium feel (and price tag) but lack the thoughtful storage configurations of this bundle. Budget-conscious parents may lean towards products like the Radio Flyer stroller wagon, which delivers affordability but falls short in safety harness quality and canopy coverage.

**Best Value for Families**  
While some might balk at the investment, the blend of features here makes it a worthy purchase for active families. Having a product capable of transforming from a stroller to a wagon with storage mindset is a benefit you don‚Äôt truly appreciate until you‚Äôre knee-deep in errands or laughs at the park. Prices in this tier remain competitive, and in my opinion, the longevity and well-thought-out design justify the splurge.

1k7kogx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k7kogx/can_the_elite_gourmet_ehc5055_coffee_maker/,Can the Elite Gourmet EHC-5055 coffee maker improve your mornings? Full review inside!,"**Compact Design for Smaller Spaces**  
The Elite Gourmet EHC-5055 caught my eye with its minimalistic and space-efficient design. Owning a small kitchen means I constantly need appliances that don't encroach on precious countertop real estate. Measuring just 6.61""D x 7.87""W x 9.25""H, this drip coffee machine fits snugly in any corner. The matte black exterior adds a clean, modern touch, making it visually at home alongside almost any decor. From my experience, it‚Äôs ideal for small kitchens, dorms, or even office break rooms where space is a luxury. Its portability makes it perfect for travel too‚ÄîI've used it in my RV during a road trip, and it was a breeze packing it up and setting it down.  

**Water Reservoir and Glass Carafe Features**  
One universal frustration with coffee makers is guessing how much water is left mid-brew. Thankfully, the semi-transparent water reservoir on this 5-cup coffee maker solves that problem with a handy water level indicator. I never find myself over or underestimating the water anymore. The 5-cup glass carafe is another bonus feature, allowing you to brew just the right amount for a couple of people or yourself without waste. A larger carafe usually leads me to make more coffee than I need, but with this, everything is just right.  

[Check Elite Gourmet EHC-5055 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07hyzzbzj/)

**Ease of Use: Weak Coffee? Strong Coffee? Your Choice!**  
Here's what truly stood out during testing‚Äîits simplicity. The reusable filter in the swing-out basket eliminates the need for endless paper filters, a win for both my wallet and the environment. Easily accessible, it's hassle-free to clean after a busy morning. The coffee maker's fully automatic mode doesn‚Äôt bombard you with complex options, yet with the right coffee grounds and measurements, you can experiment to tailor each brew to your taste. A straightforward on/off switch with a power indicator light rounds out its accessibility. Whether I was crafting an easy-going morning brew or a much-needed pick-me-up, dialing things in was effortless.  

**Pause 'N Serve for Those Who Can't Wait**  
Admit it, we've all peeked into a coffee maker brewing just to sneaky-pour a cup before it's finished. This model's Pause 'N Serve feature puts an end to coffee spills and brewing mishaps. During mornings when every minute counts, grabbing a cup mid-brew was painless without sacrificing flavor or dripping everywhere. I haven‚Äôt had a single mishap with coffee splattering over the counter.  

**Winning Points**  
- **Compact size:** Fits perfectly into small spaces.  
- **Reusable filter:** Reduces waste and costs on replacements.  
- **Pause 'N Serve feature:** A lifesaver during rushed mornings.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- **No programmable settings:** For those keen on high-tech timed brews, this isn‚Äôt it.  
- **Limited brewing capacity:** Larger households might prefer coffee makers with a bigger carafe.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this to the Mr. Coffee 5-cup drip coffee maker, I'd say the Elite Gourmet model strikes better for eco-friendliness with its reusable filter. However, Mr. Coffee's model does edge out in terms of programmability‚Äîa feature some users prefer for early-morning convenience. Keurig users, on the other hand, might argue for variety in pod flavors but would undoubtedly face higher recurring costs compared to brewing ground coffee here. Among budget-friendly options, this one holds strong especially for its no-frills practicality and robust design.  

**Value for Money**  
When weighing ease of use, lasting build, and portability, the Elite Gourmet EHC-5055 delivers solid bang for the buck. Without extra frills driving up the cost unnecessarily, its price-performance ratio feels balanced. It's an excellent solution for small households or solo coffee aficionados not looking to dive into overly complicated coffee systems. I‚Äôve ditched my usual coffee shop runs in favor of this little genius some mornings, and I‚Äôve saved not only time but a significant chunk of change.

1k7kl4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1k7kl4h/faithful_semmel/,Faithful Semmel,"This is the story of Semmel. He is a 292 days old interloper character today. I started him.. I dont know, around 2 or 3 years ago and played no other character since I started. I dont have lots of time to play, so progress is slow. However, this makes him even more valuable to me. With permadeath and Interloper difficulty, it would hard on me if he died. This simple fact makes playing TLD the most intense experience for me. No other game comes close. I do play other things occasionally but .. in terms of first person stuff, TLD hits the spot for me. And Semmel is the reason why. And I think many of you feel the same.

Over the past years, the game has changed. I did not agree to the cauger when I had the choice because I dont want to be chased out of a region, simply because I stayed there too long. I have never played it hermit style, always doing stuff and walking around, but dont need the pressure. Same for scurvy. I hate ice fishing. Its boring. And scurvy would make me do boring stuff. But I digress, you could say its not reeeeaaaallly interloper that way, but .. well. It is what it is. Semmel is my first character surviving longer than 50 days. And I think, its a magic threashold, that, once you get to a certain number of days and you are kitted out, have some stash of food everywhere, learned how not to be reckless, difficulty tapers off a bit and it gets more of a cruise than a real struggle. But its not easy.

Today, I completed Faithful Cartographer with him. Dude, it was a long walk. Semmel first went around the world as you normally do in the beginning. Collecting. Crafting. Getting comfy. That took me between 50 and 80 days. At this point, I decided to live in HRV for a time, as I didnt know the region very well and wanted to try it. Its beautiful! Damn is it nice. But so so windy. Without being able to carry a fire, like, ever.. I left after some 20 or 30 days. I dont remember exactly when I started the Tales path, but I finished around day 160. Which is when I decided to go for 500 days survival. However, it would be boring to wait it out and just ""survive"". Whats the point? So I decided to do stuff and not hibernate. So on day 160ish, Semmel started to cartograph the world. Luckily for me, I never made a map before, after all its in my head already, so I had plenty of things to do. And here we are, some 130 days later, Semmel became an interloper faithful cartographer.

The most nerve wracking thing was to cartograph Bleak Inlet. I never interacted with timberwolfs before, but .. well, it gave me the chase to even enter that region.. (I was briefly there to complete the tales .. but not for long). In the end, it wasnt so difficult but I was plenty nervous.

Anyway, here we are now. And I still want to reach 500 days, but have to fill 210 days with activities. Not sure what to do. I have not been to the Mine and I have not been to the new cliff region. So thats on the list. I can finish the new survival story lines. And sure I could cartograph the new regions too. I have never traded, so probably try that at some point.

There is new stuff to be found. Like woodworking tools. I can now customize my camp office base, which I probably will spend some days on it. But all in all, I dont think I can fill the missing 210 days with stuff to do. Any suggestions?

BTW, I made a offline list of stuff at each location. The ingame list was so cumbersome, so I tab out of the game when I leave a location and note down what I have there. I asked an AI to summarize the stuff (can I say how awsome it is that this works!? That wasnt remotely possible when I started Semmel!), some noticeable things:

* Meat: 580 (1kg each)
* Water: 328 (1L each)
* Birch: 62
* Maple: 35

* Crow feathers: 350
* Ptarmigan feathers: 101
* Bows: 2 ( I tend to make a new one when the current one breaks)
* Arrows and Arrowheads: 25 (can make more of course)

* Coal: 192 (I had some glitches where caves were full of the stuff, so I collected that and put it in front of the caves. In any case there is no shortage of coal)
* Matches: 168 (At this stage, I need one every 5 to 10 days. Plenty left and I can get by without them)

* Wolf hides: 29
* Rabbit Hide: 24 ( i dont bother with rabbits much)
* Deer hides: 35
* Moose hide: 3
* Bear Hide: 7

* Coffee: 24 (that is individual shots)
* Crackers: 13

* Sewing Kits: 15 (plenty left)
* Wetstones: 5 (thats tight)

Which just tells you how much stuff there really is, even on interloper. The only thing that is running low are sharpening stones. I have only 5 left in the entire world.",3,1745586717.0,thelongdark,3,1.0,False

What am I here for?

Looking for something real, no rush, no pressure. Whether it becomes a relationship or a solid friendship, I‚Äôm all for deep connections built on trust and presence. Real talk, good vibes, and meaningful moments.

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life‚Äôs intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There‚Äôs magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you‚Äôre into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I‚Äôm also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I‚Äôm looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn‚Äôt mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you‚Äôre someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

If something here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one random thing that made today a little brighter for you.

Also, there's a photo on my profile, would be great to see yours too",0,1745586701.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

EDIT 2: Hi again, you're all very lovely!! I just wanted to add another note here: I'm only looking for someone who strictly does not want kids in any way. I'm not looking to be dating a fence sitter only to find out 3 years down the line. Thanks for reading!!

Basic Info:

* 5'4
* Brown hair
* Green-Blue eyes
* 140lbs (mostly muscle but trying to shred down.)
* Freckled all over
* Minimal makeup, moderate around the eyes though.
* (Can't believe I have to add this, but the rules here are good and I respect them- sooooo...) YES I AM VERY VERY CHILDFREE. NO BABY SHALL BE WITHIN OR EXIT THIS MORTAL BODY. Thank you. Nor do I want a kid of any kind of procreational avenue they may be obtained by. It's a hard no from me.

A little about me:

I‚Äôm an art worker, I work on commission and I'm trying to break into the digital design job market while working part time in retail (very boring). Politics wise I'm a centrist, leaning a little more to the right but in truth I don't really care too much where you stand, left or right, as long as nobody's getting hurt. You do you, I don't mind, and the same courtesy would be lovely in return. <3

Important note: I don‚Äôt drink often if at all, it's a mild allergy, so I never go clubbing or 'out for drinks', on top of the fact that I also don't like it. I don't smoke and will not date a smoker as I'm severely asthmatic, the smell alone is enough to make me struggle with breathing - this is a boundary that has no exceptions whatsoever. I don't do drugs or any substances like that and also won't date someone who does do drugs.

I like to go out and explore. I love the mountains, hiking, the beach, long walks with the dogs, the gym and the ice rink. (I'm an ice dancer/figure skater). My love language is probably thoughtful gift giving and acts of service, just something you look at and think, ""She would love this."" While I'm slow to warm up to physical touch, I suppose I'm a bit of an old-school romantic, coffee dates, holding hands, a kiss on the cheek, sightseeing together. A cuddle is never amiss, especially with the right person, it can be like there's nowhere better to be.

I hate partying and clubbing, I had my fill of that in college. So someone who prefers good times and making memories that aren't half blacked out and fuzzy would be great. I generally dislike loud or large crowds. But- more positively, I LOVE cosy nights in, gaming, doing crafts and baking, finding a good series to watch together is a must and something I'd love to do.

I love an excuse to dress up smart like a Pinterest model too haha, I'm sure I can't be blamed for that. A good outfit and a stylish look goes very far for me. Especially in guys, an interest in looking smart and presentable is nice but of course not everything!!

We could go ice skating together, or do an adventure course, something where we don't have to take ourselves too seriously, have a laugh and a good time. Or out for coffee! (Ironically coffee makes me relaxed not energetic, so, bonus!) Or if it's too long distance, what about video games together. Baldurs Gate 3? Fall guys? Amongus? Repo? Cards against humanity? I also would prefer someone who's okay going slow, and okay with me needing time to warm up a little to someone new, someone who also has some passion for their interests/job/hobbies would be fab.

Feel free to DM me with any questions if I've missed something! \^\^

So the day basically goes like this.

* Check in at the Magnum gate in the morning. Get your cruise tickets, meal tickets, and wristband. If we're lucky they'll have coffee and donuts (they've done it in the past and its a nice unlisted perk, but don't assume they will do it every year). 

* Enjoy morning ERT by going to any of the open rides listed on the itinerary.

* After the park opens you enjoy the day like normal, but be mindful of your cruise time so you can participate in that via the Valravn gate. 

* Get some lunch whenever you feel like it, but you're responsible for that meal.

* Some time during the day pick up your t-shirt. 

* Check out the special access photo op if you'd like.

* In the evening go to the dinner. In the past they've had a Q&A session as well, but it isn't listed this year, so who know if they will do an impromptu one or not.

* Enjoy the park for the rest of the evening.

* After the park closes you go to any of the rides listed on the itinerary for the evening ERT, just like in the morning.

A few notes : 

Make sure you keep your wristband on and in good shape as it is how you access the ERT/Photo stuff. If you have a problem with it you can probably get in contact with Tony Clark (or who ever is running the event) via twitter or head up to customer service.

When you walk into the gate in the morning they may make announcements about stuff, so try to listen so you don't miss out. Last year we walked in and they told everyone **loudly** about donuts located in Back Beat Que as we got our stuff, and as we were heading to the morning ERT with out treats we had people ask us where we got them... 

We always like to take a short break in the middle of the day to check into our hotel room and drop off our t-shirt and all of that stuff. A short 30-60 minute rest in the AC really helps you push through the rest of the day.

In the past there have been no drink locations open during the ERT, so you might want to try and hydrate before, especially the night ERT when you've been out walking around all day. It would be awesome if they would have one open this year, or even a cart with water, but don't count on it.

They've normally had a QR code or something like that you could scan in the morning to get the itinerary on your phone and where they would post any updates to it. For example last year the cruise got canceled due to the weather (boat captain said it was too rough/choppy), and they put the updates out via twitter and that QR code page. I hate twitter, but I use it exclusively only for coaster stuff since many parks or clubs use it to get info out quickly to a big group. You may want to have it on your phone and follow the park and Tony Clark to get updates throughout the day (turn on notifications for them as well). You can always delete your account and the app after the event.

If they have to change anything like a ride being close for ERT or the cruise being canceled they normally try to compensate you for it. They may open a different ride for ERT, or give out a free single use fast lane or something like that.

I shouldn't have to say this, but some people never learned manners. If something doesn't go perfectly don't be a dick. Last year they gave everyone a single use fast lane since the cruise was canceled, and a few people complained loudly since they had all season fast lane, and one guy was a real jerk during the Q&A session about it. If you have a problem with something talk to someone in charge in person or electronically, and be nice about it. They will do what they can to help out.

Oh, one more tip that shouldn't have to be said, but it never fails at ANY coaster event that I've gone to since the 90s. TAKE A SHOWER, WEAR DEODORANT/ANTI-ANTIPERSPIRANT.  It isn't exclusive to ""thoosies"" by any means, but there always seems to be a couple of people at the event that don't know what personal hygiene is.

If you have any other info or tips, please add it!",7,1745586405.0,cedarpoint,3,1.0,False

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1k7kcqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1k7kcqf/need_replacement_vertuo_machine/,Need replacement Vertuo machine,"It had a good run, but my 6-year old Vertuo machine (the original Vertuo) has died.  Nespresso has offered me 35% off a new machine.  There are a lot more options available than there were in 2019 and I was hoping for some advice. (For what it's worth, I'm in the United States.)

I was pretty happy with my Vertuo.  I typically brew the 7.77 ounce ""coffee"" pods and the 5.07 ounce gran lungo pods, but I fairly regularly entertain friends who prefer the espresso and double espresso sizes.  

I don't like the taste of black coffee but generally don't bother frothing or steaming milk or worrying about the correct coffee to milk ratios; I typically just dump milk (usually almond or cashew milk, thanks to my girlfriend's dairy intolerance) into the mug.  I use almost as much milk as coffee.  If some of the machines will make a latte or whatever with no real effort on my part, I'm happy to do that, but if there's any real work required on my part I'd probably rather not bother.

When I go to a coffee shop, I always get cold brew (occasionally iced coffee).  I know some of the newer machines have a ""cold brew"" option at least with certain pods.  Are those worth it for people who prefer cold brew?

I'd appreciate any advice.  Thank you.",2,1745586056.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

1k7k9ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/1k7k9ob/metalhead_loved_the_concept_hated_the_stupidity/,"Metalhead - Loved the concept, hated the stupidity (spoilers)","**Good Concept**: I love the very probable idea of Boston-Dynamics-type robot dogs being weaponized (that seems completely inevitable, probably already happening) and then having artificial intelligence that goes awry and they start killing all humans, leading to yet another version of the apocalypse. That's great. Seems pretty likely something along those lines could happen and humans would be screwed. Good concept.

**Dumb Survivors**: My pet peeve is humans making stupid decisions in films. (I realize that dooms me to a life of cinematic pain, admittedly.) The human actions in this episode make no sense to the point of utter absurdity. I'm really tired of survivor stories where the survivors are unbelievably stupid ‚Äî ""unbelievable"" as in it's impossible to believe real-life people are likely to do those things. Sure, you can always find some bottom-of-the-barrel idiots dicking around, but those people end up on the news precisely because they were so unusually stupid.

Let's  walk through this Metalhead episode...

So, 3 fools leave a human shelter to go on an excursion into a world littered with hyper-efficient killbots. It's unclear how large and established the shelter is ‚Äî maybe it's 10 people, maybe it's 5,000? Given that, apparently, the majority of humanity has been slaughtered by these robotic ""killdogs"", you would assume the survivors have extensive knowledge about them. We know that people had forewarning because of the couple who killed themselves in bed in the house; presumably they watched the unfolding massacres on TV and knew it was only a matter of time before their house was invaded. Bella seems to know something about counting to 1000 to periodically test the bot until it enters some sort of temporary Do Not Disturb mode, so clearly people should have extensive knowledge about the killdogs.

Thus, the behavior patterns of these killdogs would be well known. You'd have seen other people being killed by them, you'd have seen the exploding balls filled with tracker-shrapnel ‚Äî let's call it ""tracknel"". You'd know the killdogs launch tracknel when waking up (like happened to the first casualty in the episode) and also when dying (as happens at the end). You'd know what can destroy them and what can't. Everyone who ever saw or heard anything about them would gossip that knowledge to everyone else. We're talking about something that is literally hunting you: people would be talking about them nonstop, even more than people talk about the Kardashians.

With that in mind, let's list some inexcusable mistakes:

1. The three stooges make this harrowing suicidal escapade to obtain exactly what sorely needed precious loot? A teddy bear. üòë For a kid dying in a few days. The insult to our intelligence is like a slap in the face to the viewer.
2. They risk their lives, their car, their equipment (transceivers, USB hack thing, etc) for literally nothing. No one from their shelter would have allowed them to do something so stupid. ""*Oh, you want to take the lifesaving community car and precious gasoline to find a teddy bear? By all means! Here, take all our food too, it's not like we need it. Let me throw in my kidneys for good measure!*""
3. They wear no armor or protection. Ever heard of a helmet? Body armor? Don't tell me ""maybe they didn't have bulletproof vests"". In Back to the Future III Marty McFly wears an iron stove door under his poncho to stop a bullet. The point is, whether it's cookware, sheet metal, cutting boards, whatever, survivors absolutely would craft makeshift armor to protect themselves when they go outside.
4. They take no weapons. If a shotgun blast can destroy a killdog, then an axe can too. You should be carrying a weapon at all times, as well as a backup. The feudal era samurai always wore two swords. You can't be bothered to carry weapons on an occasional excursion into deadly wastelands? Bullshit.
5. They carry no ""disruptors"", meaning tools to disrupt and thwart the killdogs. Toward the end a bucket of paint proves extremely effective at blinding it. If blinding it is so easy, you'd carry spray paint or duct tape or something. There must be other tech that also interrupts its sensors.
6. They have no good plan. All 3 of them leave the escape vehicle behind to enter unknown confined enclosed spaces: sheer brilliance. No lookout, no getaway driver sitting ready behind the wheel. When the killdog attacks Anthony, Bella just stands there and watches with a pointlessly horrified look on her face like she can't imagine such a thing could ever occur. She lives in the damn apocalypse; she must have seen countless people be killed near her, seen hundreds of dead bodies, had to make numerous life or death decisions. Yet, when things predictably go south, she wastes vital seconds practicing her surprise pikachu face. If you rewatch it and count, even adjusting for slow motion, she spends at least 10-15 seconds just gawking while the killdog takes its merry time walking down the ladder and leisurely shooting Anthony in the head while he tells her to go. Shortly afterward, she just stops her car and watches while Clarke generously offers himself to be blasted inside the van without attempting to evade in any way, then the van stops for a good while, then the killdog starts driving toward her. Like, what is she gonna do, Clarke is in a van ... either he survives on his own or he dies. There's nothing she can do for him by waiting, sipping her coffee, doing her makeup in the car while the killdog takes control.
7. Bella (driving a compact little hatchback) tries to ""push back"" and run the full-size van off the road: amazing intelligence. If she just put petal to the metal she would certainly outmaneuver and likely outrun the van, or she could hit the brakes and flip a quick U-turn while the larger van struggles to turn around, but no. Instead, she fights a David-vs-Goliath battle of sumo wrestling with a van and obviously loses.
8. Knowing that the killdog can no longer climb (busted leg) and knowing that it can hack electronic key systems (car ignitions, gates), she enters the house yet makes no attempt to disable the security system such as cutting the power or destroying the keypad thing or breaking the gate-swing mechanism. She also could have barricaded the doors. Yet she did nothing to prepare. It's likely the killdog never could have entered the compound if she had made any effort stop it.
9. Once inside the house, she should have looked for more tools and weapons and made a plan. Sure, a shotgun and two shells is great, but it's not enough. Axes, bats, shovels, anything to help. Also, look for a way to trap it. Lure it near a basement door and kick it in then block the door. The killdog is fairly small, it would be easy to swat it around, and those hard metal feet have very little traction to resist. Instead, she goes to the bathroom to wash her hands vigorously and cathartically because she's grossed out after touching a dead person's clothes.
10. After finally destroying the killdog, she makes no attempt to flee the impending tracknel launch. She should have known it would likely shoot more tracknel, so she should have ran behind the car right next to her, or at least duck-and-covered rather than standing up gingerly and waiting for something to happen like a doofus. Remember, survivors would have seen similar behavior and heard stories: when you finally kill the dogs, they launch a final ball of tracknel. To us, the audience, this is hard to predict, but to her this should have been common knowledge.

Anyway, they made lots of moronic decisions, and I'm pissed about that. Thoughts?",2,1745585812.0,blackmirror,6,0.63,False

Besides the high homocysteine, I have terrible OCD and ruminating/racing thoughts as well as suspected adhd.

Homocysteine levels:  
5/2024: 12.6  
1/2025: 11.8  
4/2025: 14

Serum B12: 635pg/ml  
Serum Folate: 18.5 ng/ml  
Vitamin D3: 66.4 ng/ml  
CBC normal and Ferritin 110 (I am male)

I supplement a methylated b complex which has 400mcg folate (200 as methyl and 200 as folinic) 5mg p5p b6, 25 mg r5p riboflavin and 400mcg b12 as methyl and adeno. I added 1G TMG between the 01/2025 and 04/2025 homocysteine tests. I also supplement 300mg magnesium before bed and take a trace minerals complex which contains 15mg zinc along with selenium and molydbenum. I take 10g of collagen in the morning with my coffee for some more glycine.

I am at a loss and concerned at my homocysteine levels and want to get them down asap. DO I need more folate? Even though my serum levels are kinda on the high end?

I eat extremely clean, no processed foods and go to the gym 5-6 days a week doing a mixture of light weight training and cardio, as well as 5 days a week of sauna.

Could it have something to do with my choline snps BHMT and CHKA? But wouldnt the tmg help?

Please, any help would be appreciated, thank you.

The BEST -  These are the places that scored perfect 100s.  These places are really doing a good job at keeping their kitchens clean.  The places that score a perfect 100 are really going all out to do things right and they deserve your support.

The WORST SCORERS:  Now comes everyone's favorite part of the report - the list of Rotten Restaurants who scored worse than 85.  I don't post any place that scores 85 or above even if they were the worst inspections for a particular week.  85 is a solid B and I don't want to shame them.

I'm going to stick these identifiers here so that when you see stuff like (mob) and (wh) you'll have some idea of what they are talking about.  I'm not positive about all of these but they're probably pretty close.  If you see anything I've missed or I guessed wrong please let me know.


bb - bed and breakfast?

e - fee exempt

mob - mobile

wh - warehouse

rp - recreational park

f - fixed position (a normal restaurant)

com - commissary

L - Limited Service

V - vending machines?

For coffee lovers, it's a unique and delightful way to explore new tastes and elevate their daily coffee ritual.

[[Browse top-rated coffee advent calendar on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=coffee+advent+calendar)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a coffee advent calendar hinges on several key features that directly impact the user experience and the overall value of the product.

**Variety of Coffee Origins and Roasts:** A well-curated coffee advent calendar should offer a diverse selection of coffee beans from various origins, such as South America, Africa, and Asia. The roasts should also vary, ranging from light and bright to dark and bold, ensuring a wide spectrum of flavors to explore.

The inclusion of different coffee origins and roasts is crucial for providing a comprehensive tasting experience. Users should be able to discern the unique characteristics of each coffee, learning about the nuances of different growing regions and roasting techniques. A calendar with a limited selection or repetitive flavors will quickly lose its appeal.

**Bean Freshness and Quality:** The freshness of the coffee beans is paramount. Ideally, the calendar should contain whole bean coffee, allowing users to grind the beans just before brewing for optimal flavor. The packaging should be airtight to prevent oxidation and maintain freshness.

High-quality beans are also essential. The coffee should be sourced from reputable growers and roasters, ensuring ethical and sustainable practices. Look for certifications like Fair Trade or Organic to guarantee responsible sourcing. Low-quality beans can result in a bitter or bland cup of coffee, detracting from the overall experience.

**Packaging and Presentation:** The advent calendar's packaging should be visually appealing and functional. Each coffee sample should be individually packaged and clearly labeled with information about the origin, roast, and tasting notes.

A well-designed calendar adds to the excitement of the daily reveal. The packaging should be sturdy and protect the coffee from damage during shipping and handling. Consider the overall aesthetic and whether it aligns with the recipient's taste.

**Brewing Instructions and Information:** The best coffee advent calendars provide clear and concise brewing instructions for each coffee. This information should include recommended grind size, water temperature, and brewing method.

Some calendars may also include additional information about the coffee's history, the farmers who grew it, or the roasting process. This added detail enhances the user's understanding and appreciation of the coffee. Novice coffee drinkers will particularly benefit from detailed instructions.

**Quantity and Grind Type Options:** Depending on the brand you choose, look for options in quantity and grind type. For example, is your coffee drinker single or is a whole household going to enjoy these daily cups? Is your recipient someone who has a grinder, or is it best to purchase ground coffee to avoid waste?

The ability to personalize these small details will make a big difference in the overall reception of the gift. Be sure you know what your giftee needs before committing!

 ## Core Benefits

A coffee advent calendar offers several compelling benefits that make it a worthwhile purchase for coffee enthusiasts and a unique gift option.

**Exploration of New Flavors:** The primary benefit is the opportunity to discover new coffee flavors and origins. Each day brings a new coffee to try, expanding the user's palate and knowledge of coffee. This is especially valuable for those who tend to stick to their usual coffee and want to broaden their horizons.

By sampling a variety of coffees, users can identify their personal preferences and discover new favorites. This exploration can lead to a deeper appreciation for the art and science of coffee production.

**Daily Dose of Excitement and Anticipation:** The advent calendar format creates a sense of anticipation and excitement each day. The daily reveal of a new coffee provides a small but meaningful moment of joy during the busy holiday season.

This daily ritual can be a welcome break from the stresses of everyday life. It's a fun and engaging way to start the day or enjoy an afternoon pick-me-up.

**Elevated Coffee Ritual:** A coffee advent calendar elevates the daily coffee ritual from a routine task to a special experience. The act of carefully selecting, grinding, and brewing a new coffee each day encourages mindfulness and appreciation.

This enhanced coffee experience can transform a simple cup of coffee into a moment of self-care. It's a way to savor the moment and appreciate the aroma, flavor, and complexity of the coffee.

**Unique Gift Option:** A coffee advent calendar makes a thoughtful and unique gift for coffee lovers. It's a more personalized and engaging alternative to traditional gift baskets or coffee subscriptions.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about coffee advent calendars:

**What types of coffee are typically included in a coffee advent calendar?**
   Coffee advent calendars typically include a variety of single-origin coffees, blends, and flavored coffees. The origins can range from South America (e.g., Colombia, Brazil) to Africa (e.g., Ethiopia, Kenya) to Asia (e.g., Indonesia, Vietnam). The roasts can vary from light to dark, and some calendars may include decaf options.

**How much coffee is included in each day's portion?**
   The amount of coffee in each day's portion typically ranges from 10 to 20 grams, which is enough to brew a single cup or a small pot. Some calendars may offer larger portions for those who prefer a stronger brew or want to share the coffee with others. Be sure to check the product details to know exactly how much coffee to expect.

**Are coffee advent calendars suitable for all brewing methods?**
   Most coffee advent calendars are designed to be compatible with a variety of brewing methods, including drip coffee makers, French presses, pour-over devices, and espresso machines.

Ground coffee blends, however, may not be compatible with all brewing methods, such as espresso, that require more finely ground beans.

**How long does the coffee in a coffee advent calendar stay fresh?**
   The freshness of the coffee depends on the packaging and storage conditions. Ideally, the coffee should be consumed within a few weeks of opening the calendar to ensure optimal flavor. To maximize freshness, store the coffee in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Avoid storing coffee in the refrigerator or freezer, as this can affect its flavor and aroma.

[[Browse top-rated coffee scented candles on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=coffee+scented+candles)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a coffee scented candle depends on several factors, including the type of wax used, the quality of the fragrance oils, the burn time, and the overall scent profile. LetÈà•Ê™ö examine these features in detail.

**Wax Type:** A candle's wax significantly impacts its burn quality and scent throw. Soy wax is a popular choice because itÈà•Ê™ö derived from soybeans, making it a natural and renewable resource. It burns cleaner and slower than paraffin wax, which is petroleum-based. Beeswax is another natural option known for its long burn time and subtle honey-like scent that can complement coffee fragrances. Coconut wax, often blended with other waxes, is known for its excellent scent throw and clean burn.

The choice of wax also affects how well the candle holds and releases the fragrance. Soy wax, for instance, tends to have a good scent throw, but may not be as strong as some synthetic waxes. Beeswax, while clean-burning, might require a higher concentration of fragrance oil to achieve a comparable scent intensity. The best candles often use a blend of waxes to balance these characteristics and provide an optimal burning experience.

**Fragrance Oils:** The quality of the fragrance oils is crucial in determining the authenticity and complexity of the coffee scent. High-quality fragrance oils are made with natural extracts or carefully crafted synthetic blends that accurately mimic the aroma of different coffee varieties, such as Arabica, Robusta, or specific blends like espresso or cappuccino.

Lower-quality fragrance oils may produce a synthetic or artificial scent that lacks the depth and nuance of real coffee. Some candles also incorporate complementary scents like vanilla, chocolate, caramel, or hazelnut to enhance the coffee aroma and create a more complex and appealing fragrance profile. The best candles will clearly state the type and quality of fragrance oils used, ensuring a rich and authentic scent experience.

**Burn Time:** Burn time indicates how long a candle will last before itÈà•Ê™ö completely used up. This depends on the size of the candle, the type of wax, and the wick material. Generally, larger candles with multiple wicks will have a longer burn time. Soy wax candles tend to burn slower than paraffin wax candles, providing more hours of enjoyment.

Burn time is an important consideration for cost-effectiveness. A longer burn time means you get more value for your money, as you wonÈà•Ê™õ need to replace the candle as frequently. Premium coffee scented candles often boast burn times ranging from 50 to 80 hours or more, making them a worthwhile investment for those who frequently use candles to create ambiance.

**Scent Throw:** Scent throw refers to how well the candle's fragrance fills a room. A strong scent throw is desirable for larger spaces, while a more subtle scent throw may be preferred for smaller rooms. The type of wax, the concentration of fragrance oils, and the wick size all contribute to the scent throw.

Coconut wax and soy wax are known for their good scent throw, effectively dispersing the fragrance throughout the room. Candles with multiple wicks tend to have a stronger scent throw because they create a larger melt pool, releasing more fragrance into the air. A well-balanced scent throw ensures that the candle provides a pleasant aroma without being overpowering.

 ## Core Benefits

Coffee scented candles offer a range of benefits that extend beyond simply filling a room with a pleasant fragrance. They can create a specific ambiance, boost productivity, and even offer aromatherapy benefits.

**Enhanced Ambiance:** Coffee scented candles can instantly transform the atmosphere of a room, creating a warm, inviting, and cozy environment. The aroma of coffee is often associated with comfort, relaxation, and socializing, making it ideal for living rooms, bedrooms, or even home offices.

Imagine lighting a coffee scented candle on a chilly evening while reading a book or spending time with loved ones. The fragrance can evoke feelings of warmth and nostalgia, enhancing the overall experience and making the space feel more welcoming. This can also be beneficial for creating a relaxing atmosphere for guests.

**Increased Productivity:** The scent of coffee is known to have stimulating effects on the brain, promoting alertness and focus. Lighting a coffee scented candle while working or studying can help to improve concentration and boost productivity. This is particularly useful for those who work from home or need an extra boost during long study sessions.

Many people find that the aroma of coffee helps them to stay motivated and energized, making it easier to tackle challenging tasks. The scent acts as a subtle stimulant, without the jittery side effects of actually drinking coffee. This can be a great alternative for those who are sensitive to caffeine or prefer a more gentle way to enhance their focus.

**Aromatherapy Benefits:** Certain coffee scented candles incorporate essential oils that offer aromatherapy benefits. For example, some candles may include vanilla or cinnamon, which are known for their calming and mood-boosting properties. These additional elements can enhance the overall sensory experience and provide a sense of well-being.

The use of essential oils can also contribute to stress reduction and relaxation. The combination of coffee scent with other complementary aromas creates a multi-layered fragrance that can have a positive impact on emotional state. This makes coffee scented candles a great choice for creating a soothing and therapeutic environment.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about coffee scented candles.

**How long will the scent last in the room after the candle is extinguished?**
The scent lingers in the room for approximately 30 minutes to an hour after extinguishing the candle, depending on the room's size and ventilation. A well-ventilated room will dissipate the scent more quickly than a smaller, enclosed space. To prolong the scent, consider using a candle warmer instead of burning the candle directly.

**Are coffee scented candles safe for pets and children?**
While generally safe, itÈà•Ê™ö important to keep burning candles out of reach of pets and children to prevent accidents. Ensure proper ventilation and avoid leaving candles unattended. If you are concerned about potential allergies or sensitivities, opt for candles made with natural waxes and fragrance oils, as these are less likely to contain harmful chemicals.

**What is the best way to trim the wick?**
Trim the wick to approximately 1/4 inch before each use to ensure a clean and even burn. Trimming the wick prevents the candle from smoking excessively and helps to prolong its burn time. Use a wick trimmer or scissors to carefully trim the wick, ensuring that the trimmed pieces don't fall into the wax pool.

I was never the type to scream out or brag about my life or business to everyone or anyone, but always the person in the shadow of another person who is very vocal. For example my best friend in elementary school did the same sport as me and they were always very loud about it. Let's say it was soccer (just in order to stay anonymous). Then in sixth grade when we graduated they were voted as ""the soccerplayer"" of our class and nobody actually knew that they were always missing practise and I was actually much better in this sport than them, but nobody knew. 

So today I also find myself in a similar case, this time it's my coworker who does  the exact same job as me, but they are more vocal about it so I'm sure some people think they're much better than me.. Anyway, for me, when I had my birthday I got a shared celebration with another colleague who had gotten engaged. We had some coffee and some cake, no gifts. And then when my coworker had their birthday and it was also a ""milestone birthday"", they got their own celebration with coffee and cake. Ok. But then suddenly our boss gives them a birthday gift, and a pretty nice one. So basically I got no gift when it was my birthday, so I felt a bit betrayed, disappointed and sad when I saw that my coworker got one. It makes me feel like we're being treated differently when in particular this company that I work for is striving to be a very ""non-discriminating"" workplace. It doesn't feel like it.

While movie plays, bring out a small app you havent tried, use that to make you hungry.  Then I figured use lunch as on opportunity to try everything. The round table downstairs just for food, can try all the different things.  I have food warmers like catering things. Somewhere.   The rest depended on if you had to leave or could stay.   I still carry my hope and noone can take it away, so I'll keep the rest in my head.  But the point....idk.  I just wanted to make you feel like.....I'm really appreciated.  I'm seen. I'm cared about. Loved.  I wanted to give you a perfect tavern day.  Where You didn't have to do anything but exist...no planning....all of that taken care of.  Just wanted you to enjoy yourself.  Whenever you are, I hope you're okay.  I'm still so proud of you, still the luckiest man.  You look beautiful today, Seph.  You are,  appreciated.  ",1,1745584701.0,u_ogcanwait,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone!

New lurker here on the sub ! 

We've had a Nespresso machine for several years now and love how simple and convenient it is. That said, we're starting to find the cost of pods pretty expensive compared to fresh coffee beans.

So, we‚Äôre considering switching to a superautomatic machine because we want to keep the convenience of getting a good coffee at the push of a button ‚Äî we‚Äôre not interested in a semi-automatic since we‚Äôre not looking to get too hands-on.

We‚Äôre not coffee experts, so we probably won‚Äôt notice much difference in the richness, crema, or strength between one machine and another. But we do enjoy milk-based drinks, so we‚Äôd like a machine with a milk frother. The only thing that makes me hesitate is the maintenance. After reading up on it, it sounds like milk systems need cleaning after every use, and I'm wondering if it‚Äôs as time-consuming as it seems.

Our budget is around $1000 CAD, and we're looking for something simple and easy to use. We don't have specialize coffee machine shop in our city, so we probably have tonorser online.

A couple of questions for those who made the switch from Nespresso to a superautomatic:

Does the improvement in coffee quality make up for the small loss in simplicity?

Is maintaining the milk frother really that tedious, or is it not so bad once you get used to it?

Is it hard to get used to the customization when you're a newbie in coffee making ? 


And finally :  Any machine recommendations for our situation? Again, we‚Äôre not espresso experts, so some of the subtle differences are probably not that much of a big deal for us !

Thanks a lot in advance for your help!

1k7ju84,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1k7ju84/feeling_lost_in_my_relationship/,Feeling lost in my relationship,"Lately I have been feeling a bit lost in my relationship. I am 22M and she is 21F, we both belong to the same college and are classmates.

Context about me:  
I am 22, always been this nerdy studious kinda guy with very different and niche hobbies, for example, I used to do game development and 3D modeling since I was 12, learning about VMs and stuff, all the tech nerdy kinda things since I was a kid. I also loved to do creative stuff, used to edit images with Photoshop, edit videos with Premiere Pro, VFX using after effects and all these tools by the time I was 14. I developed and published my own game, I made mods for various games as well. I always stayed at the top of my class, got good grades. I was really good at football too.  
I entered college life at 18, pursuing my degree in Information Technology, learned web development, started earning a consistent salary by the time I was 19, paid my own bills, college fee etc, basically financially independent. Still topped my class, among the top rankers in college. Even my college life has been very simple, have 2-3 great friends, they are smart and fun to hang around with. For 7 semesters (out of 8) my college life has basically been: attend college classes, work (internships)/study/learn something, playing video games with friends after I am done with work or hanging out with them, no time for relationships and I usually don't approach girls being an introvert so I don't have a lot of female friends. I currently have a job that is remote and pays really well.

I met my now girlfriend on the last day of 7th semester. She has been my classmate since 1st semester (3.5 years) and we didn't really talk about anything apart from academics.

Context about her:  
She is 21, she was kinda studious during her school times, but she isn't really the introvert kind, she is extroverted and a little over-friendly kinda person. She is outgoing and has lots of guy-friends and friends in general. She has had traumatic past, she was assaulted (her consent didn't really matter since she was minor) when she was 17. Then in college she had a 2 year relationship. She can talk to people easily. What I mean by ""over-friendly"" is that she has been to solo bike trip with her guy friend (lets call him Z) who she knew likes her. She is very opposite to my personality. She is not that smart, below average in academics, she is not as mature and wastes a lot of time. She likes reading novels and stuff though. She has recently got a job which requires her to join in a city that is far away (1000km).

We started talking over text about academic stuff, notes, programming etc. then the conversation shifted to life, music taste and other casual topics. The texting was occasional and not frequent, we met on last day of the semester and decided to meet the next day over coffee. We met and it was friendly and casual, just getting to know each other. I had to leave the same day for my home (another city). We started to talk more and more over text, then those texts shifted to calls over-time and then to video calls. We decided to meet next month (January). We met and confessed and started dating.

Why am I lost?

1. My Insecurities:
   * She went on solo trips with her guy-friend (Z) multiple times, eventhough they are on very bad terms now because that guy-friend (Z) lied to me about her and about me to her so that we break up, that's a whole different story but she's been to concerts, walks, stand-up shows with him (just the two of them), they have been to cafes even at 3-4am, basically night outs. Cycling, badminton and what not.
   * She went on a group trip (8 people) where mostly these two were away from the other 6. It was a beautiful hill station, they went to bike rides there, sitting along the riverbank there and whatever.
   * A few days before her birthday when she was leaving for her hometown the guy-friend (Z) asked her to talk to him once and that he is coming to her apartment to pick her up. She asked me on the phone and I said it's her call. She sat in the car and he took her to the temple and brought a cake for her as a surprise, I felt really sad because I was at home and I couldn't do anything for her in that situation but he did.
   * Her ex sent her flowers and a cake at midnight on her birthday, she wasn't at her apartment at that time, she was at her home (another city), we were on google meet at that time. She made a friend receive that cake for her, it was covered with roses, it had a rose bouquet with it.
   * She had a crush during her high school, she is still in touch with that guy and I don't ask her to block him because it would seem like I am controlling her¬†etc. But he is sometimes still in her recent instagram DMs and still added on snapchat. I really don't like that.
   * Sometimes we watch something over google meet late at night and then she sleeps over google meet while I work till 3-3:30am. Same happened last night, but she woke up from her sleep at around 5am, a little terrified probably because of a nightmare. I told her I won't have my phone for the night. I woke up at around 8:30am to her text ""can't sleep, I am scared, should I call someone?"" which she sent at 5am. I called her right then and asked if she is alright, she said she is fine and she called her guy-friend (call him X) and she slept while he was on call. While I understand that she was scared and would have called me if I was there but this was something I thought was special to us.
   * She still has photos with her ex on her laptop and I just feel really sad when I see that folder there.
   * She was feeling a little down so she wanted to go to a temple or something and thought to go out with her not-so-good guy friend (call him Y). I am not insecure here but I just feel it was special between us.. guess I was wrong.
2. Her Insecurities:
   * As I said I have very limited friends, there's this girl (call her M) from our class who talks to me solely about academics, we talk only when we have exams/tests going on. On last second day of 7th semester, M asked if we can go out for dinner since she had to move out of the city next month and everyone's going home in two days. I was like ""sure"", the reason I agreed is partially because she invited me to her birthday party but I didn't (it was all guys). So we went out to a famous milkshake outlet, I wore a pink shirt that day. Now my gf says she will never go to that outlet and doesn't really like it when I wear that pink shirt.
   * I met a girl (call her J) through reddit, she asked me about internships and college in general, we had a friendly chat on reddit then we moved to whatsapp when she gave me her number. She is 2 years junior to me so I occasionally guide her with all this. J and me, both are night-owls, so I was with my gf one night and she called me at around 12:30 am and my gf was upset with this.
3. Other issues:
   * She is really pretty so she is kinda popular in college, she has a lot of instagram followers. Me on the other hand hate social media, I have one post on instagram from 9 years ago. Never put up a story on any occasion anywhere. So we went on an outing and she put up our story with a romantic song in the background and asked me to remention/repost that story. I didn't have the instagram app, I downloaded that and I put that on close friends, she was offended, she deleted the story. Cut the call and switched her phone off. I texted her to sort it out, called her back a few times. She switched her phone back on, I asked over text if she's alright and wants to sort it, she said she doesn't want to talk about it and will discuss it in the morning. I said that I am still awake if she wants to talk and after about 40 mins I dropped a text that I will be going to sleep in the next 10 mins and if she wants to talk we can talk about it, she declined again and said that she will talk about it in the morning and I went to sleep. Then I woke up to 60 deleted messages on whatsapp, I know she screenshots them before deleting, I asked for the screenshot next morning, she sent them to me and they said ""I won't post you ever again anywhere online, instagram snapchat anywhere"" etc. She occasionally brings it up saying ""I would have put a story but.."".

Even after all these issues, she is sweet, she brought flowers for me when I was sad, she would pluck flowers for me when we walk, but that's rare. In return I don't know what I can do that would make her feel special, if I think of giving her flowers/bouquet her ""guy-friend"" have done that, cake and roses, her ex did that. Bike trips? she already went on multiple with her guy-friend. I fail to find something that is exclusive between me and her. She's been the only one I did most of the stuff with.

I feel lost because I feel like apart from physical intimacy I am just a more available friend to her. I can't find anything that she has done exclusive with me. While on my side, 95% things I did were just with her. She is my first everything. Now I feel like I have ruined myself. If I break up with her someday, I couldn't love the next girl the same way and I think I have wasted my emotions over someone who doesn't really care much about efforts, love and making the other one feel special. I will probably carry these regrets onto my next relationship if that ever happens. I would've experienced things that she hasn't and I would probably ruin those special feelings for her as well, like it happened with me.

I don't know how to feel, I just feel sad that I fail to find something that she has not experienced with someone already, makes me feel like I am just another guy in her life.

TLDR;  
22M, nerdy, introverted, financially independent, and academically driven. Started dating 21F classmate in final semester after years of barely talking. She's outgoing, has a traumatic past, many guy friends, and a history of close moments (bike trips, late-night outings, etc.) with a guy-friend (Z) who liked her and tried to break us up. Also still receives attention from her ex and stays in touch with past crushes.

I feel emotionally drained and insecure‚Äîshe‚Äôs done many ""special"" things (bike trips, romantic gestures) with others before me, and I can‚Äôt find anything that feels exclusive between us. She gets upset over minor things (me not reposting her story), but I overlook much more. I‚Äôm her first for nothing, but she‚Äôs my first for almost everything. I fear I‚Äôve given too much of myself to someone who may not value it the same way, and that I‚Äôll carry this regret into future relationships.",1,1745584551.0,OffMyChestIndia,5,1.0,False

# Kirkland Water Bottles (2025): Are They Still The BEST Value? Review & Alternatives

Are you looking for the best value in bottled water? Whether you're a business stocking your office, a family hydrating on the go, or an event organizer planning a large gathering, the question of ""which water to buy"" always comes down to cost, quality, and convenience. for years, Kirkland water bottles have been a popular choice, and for good reason. But in 2025, with evolving consumer demands and a shifting economic landscape, is Kirkland water still the undisputed champion of value? Let's dive into a extensive review, exploring pricing, quality, sustainability, and some compelling alternatives.

## Understanding the Appeal of Kirkland Water Bottles

Kirkland Signature water, a staple at Costco and Costco Business Center locations, is synonymous with bulk buying and affordability. For many, the phrase ""kirkland water cost"" immediately brings to mind the idea of saving money while stocking up on a necesary essential. its popularity stems from several key factors:

*   **Competitive Pricing:** Kirkland water price is consistently lower than many other bottled water brands, especially when purchased in bulk. This makes it an attractive option for budget-conscious businesses and families alike.*   **Accessibility:** Exclusively sold at Costco (and through their online partners like Instacart), it's readily available to Costco members nationwide.
   **Perceived Quality:** Marketed as ""purified drinking water,"" Kirkland water undergoes rigorous filtration and reverse osmosis processes, ensuring a clean and refreshing taste. A ""proprietary mineral blend"" is then added to create Kirkland Signature's pure taste, as stated on Costco's website.
   **Convenience:** The standard 16.9 fl oz bottle size is perfect for on-the-go hydration, fitting easily into bags and car cup holders.

## Who is Buying Kirkland Water Bottles?

To understand the enduring appeal of Kirkland water bottles, it's crucial to examine the core demographics of the average consumer:

**1. Businesses:**

   **Businesses:** Offices, restaurants, catering companies, event planners, and retail stores. These businesses need a cost-effective solution to give their employees, customers, event attendees, or retail patrons readily available drinking water.
   **Needs:** Businesses prioritize bulk purchasing options, a consistent supply chain of ""wholesale water bottles,"" and competitive pricing. Convenient delivery options are also crucial.They also want to be assured that they can purchase what they need without supply chain disruptions. Businesses also need reasonable ""water bottles for office"" use.
   **Search Intent:** ""buying in bulk,"" ""comparing pricing,"" ""seeking delivery services,"" and ""finding a reliable supplier"" are all common search intents.
   **Example:** A medium sized tech company looking for ‚Äúwater bottles for office‚Äù use may query about ""kirkland water delivery"" and then compare ‚Äúkirkland water price‚Äù versus generic alternatives.

**2. Consumers/Households:**

   **Consumers/Households:** Individuals and families looking to purchase drinking water for home use, travel, or on-the-go consumption.
   **needs:** ""Affordable pricing"" is paramount. Consumers also desire convenient purchase locations (Costco) and portable bottles. Trusted brand perceptions and good water quality are also vital considerations. Larger pack sizes encourage cost savings and decrease the incidence of needing to make repeat purchasing trips. Lastly, consumers are more cognizant of the need for ""kirkland water recycling"" considerations.
   **Search Intent:** They want to find the ""best price per bottle,"" locate Costco stores or online options, understand bottle sizes and quantity, and learn about water quality.
   **Example:** A family preparing for a road trip will likely search ""kirkland water price"" and ""kirkland water bottle size"" to consider various purchasing options.

**3.Event Organizers:**

   **Event Organizers:** Individuals or companies planning events (sports, festivals, conferences) that need bulk water provisions.
   **Needs:** They need ""bulk purchasing options,"" delivery to the event location, and competitive pricing. Easy storage solutions and a reliable supplier are essential to ensure water availability. Environmental consciousness also encourages looking for ""kirkland water recycling"" options for events.
   **Search Intent:** Common searches involve comparing vendor prices for large quantities, arranging delivery logistics, and finding environmentally amiable options.
   **Example:** A marathon organizer will definately search ""pallet of kirkland water"" to ascertain product availability and the number of attendees served per pallet.

## Analyzing the Cost: Kirkland Water vs. the Competition

the primary reason why many choose Kirkland water is its price. But how competitive is it in 2025? Prices can fluctuate based on location, promotions, and whether you're buying in-store or online via services like Instacart. Let's consider a hypothetical cost comparison assuming a standard 40-bottle case:

   **Kirkland Water:** A case of Kirkland purified water generally hovers around $4-$6 at Costco warehouses. this represents an unbelievable value, often making it the ""cheapest bottled water"" option available. Costco Business centers may offer slight price variations on ""costco business center water.""
   **National Brands (e.g., Dasani, Aquafina):** These brands typically cost $6-$8 for a comparable 24-bottle case.
   **Regional Brands:** Prices vary substantially but are generally in the same range as national brands.
   **Alternatives:** Generic store-brand water bottles from other retailers often fall within the same price range as Kirkland.

To truly assess the value, you must calculate the price per bottle. Kirkland consistently comes out on top in this metric, making it the ""best value bottled water"" for those seeking the most hydration for their dollar. However, keep an eye out for sales and promotions from other brands, which can sometimes close the cost gap.

## Delving into Quality and Ingredients: What's in Your Kirkland Water?

while price is a notable factor,quality remains paramount. Kirkland Signature purified drinking water undergoes a multi-stage purification process, which typically includes filtration, reverse osmosis, and disinfection, to remove impurities and ensure a clean taste. Costco's website specifies that a proprietary mineral blend is added for taste. Examining ""kirkland water ingredients"" reveals that, beyond purified water, it contains added minerals for taste and electrolytes.

Understanding ""kirkland water nutrition facts"" reinforces that the bottled water contains zero calories, no artificial flavors or colors. For those concerned with pH levels, researching ""kirkland water pH level"" uncovers information surrounding the level of acidity present in the drinking water.

However, concerns about the plastic used in bottled water are on the rise. While Kirkland bottles are typically made from recyclable PET plastic, the recycling rate for plastic bottles remains a global challenge. This is where alternatives become increasingly appealing.

## Sustainability Considerations: Kirkland Water Recycling and Beyond

Environmental consciousness is growing rapidly, especially for informed consumers and event organizers. ""Kirkland water recycling"" is a common search query as peopel want to reduce their footprint. the good news is that Kirkland bottles are made from PET plastic, which is widely recyclable.

However, the real challenge lies in ensuring these bottles actually make it to recycling facilities. Consumers need to be proactive in properly disposing of the bottles in designated recycling bins. For event organizers, partnering with recycling services to collect and process used bottles is a responsible and increasingly expected practice.beyond simply recycling, consider these more sustainable alternatives:

   **Refillable Water Bottles:** encouraging employees, attendees, or family members to use refillable bottles is the most environmentally friendly option. Pair this with water coolers or filtration systems (see alternatives below).
   **Biodegradable Water Bottles:** While not yet widely available or cost-effective, biodegradable water bottles represent a promising future for sustainable hydration.
   **Water Filtration Systems:** For businesses, investing in a high-quality water filtration system for the office can eliminate the need for bottled water altogether. Employees can fill their own reusable bottles, reducing plastic waste and saving money long-term.## Exploring Alternatives to Kirkland Water Bottles

While kirkland water offers excellent value, it's not the only option. Here are some compelling alternatives to consider, depending on your specific needs and priorities:

**1. Other Bottled Water Brands (National and Regional):**

   **Pros:** Wider availability, diverse flavor options (flavored sparkling water), and potential for sales and promotions.
   **Cons:** Generally more expensive than Kirkland water.
   **When to Consider:** If you prefer a specific brand or flavor, or if Kirkland water is unavailable in your area.

**2.Store-brand Water Bottles:**

   **Pros:** Similar price point to Kirkland, readily available at various grocery stores.
   **Cons:** Quality and taste may vary depending on the retailer.
   **When to Consider:** As a readily available substitute when kirkland water is unavailable.

**3. Water Filtration Systems (For Home and Office):**

   **Pros:** Sustainable, cost-effective in the long run, and provides a continuous supply of filtered water.
   **Cons:** Initial investment required, requires maintenance (filter replacements).
   **When to Consider:** as a long-term solution to reduce plastic waste and ensure access to clean drinking water.**4. Bulk Spring Water Delivery:**

*   **Pros:** Delicious, natural taste, often delivered directly to your door.*   **Cons:** Can be more expensive than purified water, requires space for storage. Some people may specifically be seeking ""kirkland spring water,"" however, Kirkland water is purified.   **When to consider:** If you prioritize taste and prefer natural spring water over purified water.

**5. Water Coolers (For Offices and Events):**

   **Pros:** Provides a readily available source of chilled water, frequently enough with hot water options for tea or coffee.
   **Cons:** Requires space, electrical outlet, and regular maintenance.
   **When to Consider:** For offices or events where a large volume of water is needed.

## Making the Right choice: A Checklist for 2025

In 2025, the decision of whether or not to buy Kirkland water bottles still depends on individual needs and values. Use the following checklist to guide your choice:

   **Price Sensitivity:** if budget is your top priority, Kirkland water remains a strong contender, especially when purchased in bulk. compare ""kirkland water cost"" against other bottled water and bulk water options.
   **Convenience:** If you're a Costco member and appreciate the ease of buying in bulk, Kirkland water is a convenient choice. Consider using delivery services to ensure greater access.
   **quality Expectations:** Kirkland water undergoes a rigorous purification process, ensuring a clean and refreshing taste. If you prioritize high-quality purified water, Kirkland Signature water fulfills these standards
   **Sustainability Concerns:** If environmental impact is a major factor, consider alternatives like refillable bottles, water filtration systems, or biodegradable water bottles. Look into options for ""kirkland water recycling"" in your area.
   **Specific Needs:** Consider the specific requirements of your business, household, or event. ""Water bottles for catering"" versus ""water bottles for office"" versus ""water bottles for events"" may entail different product packaging preferences.

## The Verdict: Is Kirkland Water Still the BEST Value in 2025?

1k7jp5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k7jp5n/i_tasted_real_coffee_for_the_first_time_in_my_life/,"I tasted ""real"" coffee for the first time in my life.","For the record, I've posted a botched Dedica shot before in this subreddit, from which I got plenty of info on how to dial in starting from a good grinder. However, this is not related to my own coffee machine experience but rather my daily life.

Let's begin

--

Hello, first of all I live in Portugal, a country in which coffee is sort of a great deal, but not in the way you'd imagine it. 

A regular espresso here is strong and acidic, sometimes too bitter, like there's no clear flavor to taste even if you drink it at the same caf√© everyday, making it not so appealing to drink as is, which in turn prompted the Portuguese community (namely from Porto, the place I'm in) to lean into drinking most (if not all) of the coffee they've had in their lifetime with 1 to 2 little sachets of sugar so that there's some sort of satisfying flavor in it.

This has been bothering me for a while, I've been here for 6 years already, and for the last 3 years I've been working at a tourist caf√© in which we happen to have a decent commercial machine (Rancilio Classe 7) that makes decent coffee too, and even though the coffee that comes out of it is not bad at all when drunk as is I still drink most of my coffee with sugar due to the sheer bitterness and unpleasant aftertaste of it.

I'd heard of a coffee roaster shop nearby that was undergoing some maintenance and they closed for about 4 months or so, and they recently re-opened so I thought: maybe I should taste their coffee? Maybe it's good and I'll come back sooner than later?

So I went there, as I started talking to the very nice female barista who coincidentally speaks the same native language as me (Spanish) I kept an eye on the price table, and goodness me is it more expensive than I thought! 2‚Ç¨ for an espresso is just above double the regular price for one in any other caf√© (ranging from 0.80‚Ç¨-1‚Ç¨) but I bit the bullet regardless, it all looked magnificent inside the humble-looking tiny espresso shop.

As she went on to make my coffee, I noticed the machine is one I've seen a lot of times in this subreddit, it's a La Marzocco machine that I do not know the model of, but just judging by the brand and the beans I saw in the background counters of the shop I expected something nicer than whatever my caf√©'s machine could do.

My espresso was done, in the end it costed about 2.30‚Ç¨ since I ordered takeaway and cups are somewhat expensive I guess? Nevermind that, I tipped the nice girl and walked down the street... Then I tasted the coffee that I'd just bought, no sugar, no nothing, just my nice espresso and me.

And let me tell you there was nothing better I could wish upon anyone than feeling what I felt when I took my first sip.

I felt like I've been living a lie.

All the coffee I've drank since I was 7 at my grandma's.

All the people telling me sugar is what makes coffee good.

Everything crumbled.

I cannot quite describe what the flavor of this coffee was off the top of my head, but it felt subtle, I felt refreshed somewhat, several flavors rotating around my taste buds, everything felt RIGHT for once.

And no terrible aftertaste, just a rather funny feeling of victory. I finally drank a GOOD shot of espresso.

This prompted me to look harder into my espresso making, adding a grinder to my cart, beans I'd probably just buy them from the caf√© shop where this story originated from. And if this is not enough to make such a good tasting coffee as the one I had there, I'd just buy the same machine because it was just magical.

That's the story for today, I hope you liked it and I hope you guys also share similar experiences if you had them.",60,1745584122.0,espresso,30,0.89,False
1k7jp3t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k7jp3t,Found the Most Aesthetic Coffee Shop in Chattanooga ‚Äì The Plant Bar,"If you‚Äôre in Chattanooga and love bold design and great coffee, The Plant Bar is a must-visit. This spot is a vibrant, color-filled caf√© with a seriously aesthetic interior‚Äîbright walls, stylish decor, and tons of natural light.

I stopped in for coffee and ended up staying much longer than planned. The vibe is perfect for getting some work done, catching up with friends, or just enjoying a calm moment in a beautiful space. Plenty of seating, outlets, and cozy corners‚Äîplus, the espresso was top-tier.

Whether you're a local or just passing through, this place nails the balance of quality and atmosphere. Easily one of the coolest coffee shops I‚Äôve been to in Tennessee.

For past +6 months been the worst my skin has ever been. Consistent white heads and pustules. Had acne as teen; fair complexion w/ dry skin. Wash face 2x per day - don‚Äôt like putting sunscreen / moisturizer on face because they tend to make skin oily and break me out. Tried accutane, doxycycline, soolantra and currently using sulfur soap w metro cream. Cleaned up my diet about 4 months ago (chicken / fish / meat with veggies and fruit) Limiting dairy gluten and coffee. Limited alcohol but still snack on dark chocolate every now and then. To be honest don‚Äôt know what my triggers really are. Stress/anxiety probably one of the key ones? I haven‚Äôt washed my forehead with soap in probably 3 years and almost entirely clear. Problem is chin and mustache area. Have blackheads on nose and get flushed skin but really focused on the pimples. Feels like one goes away and two new one show up. Any thing you can recommend would be greatly appreciated. Good face wash / sunscreen / moisturizer for dry skin with type 2? Any formal tests to see if food allergy or poor gut health is an issue.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>When chilly days roll in, few desserts can warm your heart quite like a rich, creamy hot chocolate ice cream. This delightful treat combines the cozy comfort of hot chocolate with the refreshing delight of ice cream, making it the perfect winter warmer. Unlike traditional hot chocolate drinks, this recipe transforms those familiar flavors into a creamy frozen dessert that melts just right on your tongue, balancing sweetness and bitterness with every spoonful.

### Choosing the Right Ingredients for the Ultimate Flavor

The base of your hot chocolate ice cream sets the tone for the entire dessert. To create a luscious texture and deep flavor, use high-quality cocoa powder and dark chocolate. Opt for unsweetened cocoa powder for a richer chocolate taste, and add chopped bittersweet or semisweet dark chocolate for texture and extra cocoa goodness. Whole milk and heavy cream work best to provide that creamy, smooth mouthfeel that melts perfectly.

Sweeteners also play a key role. Granulated sugar is common, but you can experiment with brown sugar or honey for subtle flavor contrasts. Vanilla extract complements the chocolate, bringing out its warmth. For an adult twist, a splash of your favorite liquor, such as bourbon or coffee liqueur, can add depth and richness without overpowering the chocolate.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Crafting Your Hot Chocolate Ice Cream

Making this ice cream at home is easier than you might think. Here‚Äôs a simple process that yields a creamy, chocolatey treat:

1. **Prepare the Chocolate Base:** In a medium saucepan, whisk together cocoa powder, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Slowly stir in milk and cream, then bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Constant stirring helps prevent scorching.
2. **Add Melted Chocolate:** Remove the pan from heat and stir in chopped dark chocolate until fully melted and smooth. This step intensifies the chocolate flavor and adds a velvety finish.
3. **Incorporate Egg Yolks:** Beat egg yolks in a separate bowl. Gradually whisk a small amount of the warm chocolate mixture into the yolks to temper them. Then return everything to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.
4. **Chill the Custard:** Pour the custard through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps and transfer to a container. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to allow flavors to meld and cool completely.
5. **Churn into Ice Cream:** Once chilled, pour the custard into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. The mixture thickens and aerates, developing the perfect ice cream texture.
6. **Freeze to Set:** Transfer the churned ice cream into a freezer-safe container. Freeze for 2 to 4 hours to firm up, ensuring scoopable, creamy consistency.
 
### Tips to Personalize Your Winter Warmer Ice Cream

Feel like adding some creative flair? Here are some ideas to customize your hot chocolate ice cream:

- **Swirl in Marshmallow Sauce:** Add a gooey marshmallow ribbon by gently folding it into the ice cream before the final freeze.
- **Toast Some Nuts:** Chopped toasted hazelnuts, pecans, or almonds add a crunchy texture that complements the creamy ice cream.
- **Spice It Up:** A pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, or chili powder can bring an unexpected warmth that echoes traditional winter spices.
- **Drizzle with Caramel or Fudge:** Create pockets of sweetness by layering caramel or fudge sauce within the ice cream as it freezes.
 
### Serving Suggestions for Maximum Comfort

This hot chocolate ice cream is perfect on its own, but pairing it with complementary treats can elevate your cozy experience:

- A warm brownie or chocolate cookie on the side enhances the chocolate theme.
- Fresh berries like raspberries or strawberries add a bright contrast to the rich chocolate.
- Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa powder for an indulgent caf√©-style dessert.
 
Making hot chocolate ice cream at home offers the ultimate winter comfort food experience. It‚Äôs rich, creamy, and full of deep chocolate flavor, yet cool and refreshing‚Äîperfect for after a day spent outside in the cold. With simple ingredients and easy steps, your kitchen will fill with the tempting scent of cocoa and vanilla, making the whole process as enjoyable as the tastiest reward itself. Next time the weather dips low, treat yourself to this warm-inspired frozen delight that perfectly captures the spirit of winter in every bite.

</div>Tips and Tricks for Enhancing Your Winter Warmer Desserts Beyond Ice Cream
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Experiment with Warm Spices

Winter desserts thrive on deep, comforting flavors that evoke cozy moments. To make your winter warmer desserts stand out, introduce warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and cardamom. These spices instantly elevate the flavor profile of desserts such as puddings, pies, and baked goods. For example, sprinkling cinnamon and nutmeg on top of apple crisps or mixing cardamom into your batter can bring an aromatic twist that makes your dessert feel extra special and festive.

### Use Seasonal Fruits and Vegetables

Seasonal produce adds freshness and natural sweetness to winter desserts. Incorporate fruits like pears, apples, cranberries, and persimmons, or vegetables like pumpkin and sweet potato into your dishes. Roasting these ingredients before using them intensifies their flavors, adding a caramelized depth. For instance, roasted pumpkin combined with a touch of brown sugar and spices can create a rich filling for tarts or a creamy base for mousses. Using seasonal ingredients also means your desserts are at their peak flavor and often more affordable.

### Add Texture to Your Dishes

Texture plays a crucial role in making desserts interesting and satisfying. Combine creamy, crunchy, and chewy components to create a multi-dimensional eating experience. Consider layering desserts with crushed nuts, toasted coconut flakes, or cookie crumbles. A drizzle of honey or a spoonful of chunky fruit compote can add contrast as well. For example, try adding a praline crunch topping to panna cotta or scatter toasted pecans over a warm fruit cobbler. These little touches keep every bite engaging, appealing both to the palate and the eyes.

### Incorporate Unexpected Ingredients for Depth

Surprising ingredients can deeply enhance the flavor of your winter warmer desserts. A splash of espresso amplifies chocolate‚Äôs richness, while a pinch of finely chopped chili can balance sweetness with a spark of heat. Similarly, a dash of smoked salt can contrast beautifully with sugary elements, heightening overall complexity. Have you tried stirring a little molasses into your dough or adding a bit of grated orange zest to your whipped cream? These subtle additions awaken the palate and add layers of flavor that keep desserts from becoming one-note.

### Play with Temperature Combinations

Contrasting temperatures in desserts can create delightful sensory experiences. Combining warm and cold elements draws attention to textures and flavors in exciting ways. Serve a hot fruit compote or sauce alongside cold creamy desserts or swirl a shot of hot espresso over vanilla ice cream. For instance, pairing warm spiced pears with chilled yogurt or ice cream not only balances sweetness but also reinforces cozy, comforting feelings during cold months. This simple technique can make familiar desserts feel fresh and inviting.

### Use Alcohol to Enhance Flavors

Adding a splash of alcohol can bring depth and warmth to winter desserts. Ingredients like brandy, bourbon, rum, or fortified wines such as sherry and port are classic choices that complement seasonal flavors. A bit of bourbon in caramel sauce or brandy in fruit compote adds a rich, smoky note that deepens the overall taste. Be sure to cook off excess alcohol if serving to children or if you prefer a milder flavor. Properly used, alcohol enhances the dessert's aroma and complexity, turning simple dishes into indulgent treats.

### Master the Art of Cream and Custard

Rich creams and custards create luxurious textures essential in winter desserts. Learning to make smooth custards, silky ganache, or whipped cream infused with subtle flavors will elevate your creations dramatically. You can fold herbs like rosemary or thyme into cream or infuse vanilla beans for a fragrant touch. Custards can be flavored with hot cocoa powder to bridge the gap between traditional hot chocolate and dessert. The creaminess provides a perfect balance for sweet, spicy, and bitter notes common in winter flavors.

### Integrate Nuts and Seeds for Nutritious Crunch

Nuts and seeds not only adds texture but also boosts nutritional value. Almonds, walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts complement flavors like chocolate, coffee, and spices beautifully. Toasting these before adding them intensifies their nutty aroma, supporting winter flavors perfectly. Chia seeds or flax seeds mixed into batters or as toppings contribute a subtle crunch and provide essential nutrients. A sprinkle of toasted nuts on top of a warm pudding or drizzled with honey adds interest and a natural sweetness that feels wholesome.

### Present with Comfort in Mind

The presentation of your winter warmer desserts should reflect the feeling of comfort and warmth. Serve in rustic dishes or mugs, use soft napkins, and garnish with seasonal sprigs such as rosemary or holly berries for a festive touch. Layer dishes attractively in glass cups to show off textures and vibrant colors. When you present your desserts thoughtfully, it invites your guests to slow down, enjoy, and appreciate the cozy effort placed into their winter indulgence.

</div>### Conclusion

1k7jna9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1k7jna9/does_he_like_me_or_am_i_imagining_it/,"Does he like me, or am I imagining it?","Hey guys! I‚Äôll try to keep this short, but i have an upcoming coffee situation and need some advice about a guy.

So, there‚Äôs this guy I like, let‚Äôs call him John. John and I are both in college, except John is one year above me. He is the president of this business club I‚Äôm in, through which I met him.

John and I started getting along a lot more this semester, and we are now (I would say) pretty good friends. Except, we have never hung out intentionally just the two of us.

Here is an overview of the dynamic between us:

1. Two months ago, John was hosting a pasta-making social at his apartment. Everyone was in the kitchen helping, and I asked what I could help with. Someone there told me to mince the garlic, but I had never minced garlic before (ik ik). So John volunteered to teach me how to cut it. But when I say teach, I mean he literally asked for permission to grab my hands, and then stood around me holding both my hands while he taught me.

2. Last weekend, our club took a trip. During the first day at lunch, he asked me if I spoke Spanish, and I said I did. He asked why we didn‚Äôt speak more Spanish together. He then said that he learned a little in high school but that he wasn‚Äôt very good and that he would like to learn more, so he was like ‚Äúyou should teach me sometime‚Äù. And I was like yeah I‚Äôd love to.

3. At the club trip, later that same evening, everyone in the club was huddled around in this hut with benches playing a card game. But my friend and I came in late. I let my friend take the last available seat and was going to sit on the floor, when John called me over and was like ‚ÄúMy Name, come sit over here,‚Äù while patting the space next to him. But when I say there was like no space between him and this other person he was seated next to, I mean like no space. So I went to sit over beside him but the whole time our legs were literally touching.

4. The next morning on the club trip during brunch, he had been talking to his friends and as soon as I sat down near him he stopped and turned around in his seat and made a conversation with me. At one point, he even leaned in and rested his head on his hands while looking into my eyes. 

5. He‚Äôll do other things too, like call me by a nickname, constantly praise me about my hobbies/talents, and make sure to quiet everyone down in the room when I‚Äôm speaking. He‚Äôll also always stop by to say hello, and on some occasions say goodbye multiple times before leaving for good. Additionally, the other day I was studying in the library, and he came all the way across the room and sat down with me for literally 2 minutes before his next class. Additionally, we make great eye contact.

At the beginning of the week, I had casually asked to get coffee with him, and he replied enthusiastically and asked to do it on Friday afternoon. But then he sent me a GCal invite from the club coffee chat email. So that‚Äôs when I first started doubting everything.

Now, here‚Äôs where I get conflicted:

1. We barely ever text about anything other than the club or business. Sometimes when we do text about business, he never branches the conversation out.
2. I invited him to come with me and 7 other people on a walk during the trip and he said ‚Äúnah I‚Äôm good‚Äù
3. There was some girl he left with at a party around 2 and a half months ago
4. And additionally, the strongest sign that I think is against me is what happened today. Basically, me, John, and a mutual female friend (who is much better friends with John) were walking back to the car. The mutual friend casually says to me ‚ÄúHey, did you know John has a girlfriend?‚Äù. John immediately replies, ‚ÄúNo, no, I don‚Äôt. Why would you say that?‚Äù And then he added, ‚Äúwhy are you making me feel lonely?‚Äù Or something along those lines. Then, his friend was like ‚Äúok, he‚Äôs almost gonna have a girlfriend, because he‚Äôs been talking to this girl. I‚Äôve been trying to get him to but he still won‚Äôt tell me who it is?‚Äù. I chimed in and asked who it was and told him to spill. But he still didn‚Äôt say anything.

So now, I‚Äôm honestly just so confused and need some advice. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, and it‚Äôs not often that I have a real crush on someone. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not overstepping and not being biased when reading the signs.

So, Reddit, do you think he likes me? 

TLDR: There‚Äôs this guy I like that I‚Äôm not sure likes me back. We‚Äôve had a few moments, but there‚Äôs some evidence stacked against me. I‚Äôm seeking out advice to see what you think about his behavior towards me.

Thank you so much if you made it this far! I know I wrote a lot, so thank you!",1,1745583959.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a coffee candle depends on several factors, including the wax type, fragrance oils, burn time, and overall scent profile. Understanding these features is crucial for selecting a candle that meets your expectations and preferences.

**Wax Type**

The type of wax used in a candle significantly impacts its burn quality, scent throw, and environmental impact. Common options include paraffin, soy, beeswax, and coconut wax. Paraffin wax, while inexpensive, is derived from petroleum and can release potentially harmful chemicals when burned. Soy wax is a popular eco-friendly alternative, made from soybean oil. It burns cleaner than paraffin and has excellent scent retention. Beeswax is a natural option with a subtle honey scent, known for purifying the air. Coconut wax is another sustainable choice, offering a clean, slow burn and a strong scent throw.

**Fragrance Oils**

The fragrance oils determine the authenticity and intensity of the coffee scent. High-quality fragrance oils are essential for creating a realistic and enjoyable aroma. Some candles use natural essential oils, while others use synthetic fragrance oils. Natural essential oils can provide a more nuanced and complex scent, but they may be more expensive. Synthetic fragrance oils can be formulated to mimic specific coffee blends or add complementary notes like vanilla or chocolate. The concentration of fragrance oils also affects the scent throw, which is the ability of the candle to fill a room with its aroma.

**Burn Time**

Burn time is an important consideration for the candle's value. A longer burn time means you can enjoy the candle for more hours before needing to replace it. Burn time depends on the wax type, the size of the candle, and the wick type. Soy and coconut wax candles tend to have longer burn times than paraffin candles. Properly trimming the wick before each use can also extend the burn time and prevent smoking.

**Scent Profile**

The scent profile refers to the specific aroma notes present in the candle. Some coffee candles focus solely on the scent of freshly brewed coffee, while others incorporate complementary notes to create a more complex fragrance. Common additions include vanilla, caramel, chocolate, hazelnut, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. The ideal scent profile is subjective, depending on individual preferences.

Key features to consider in a coffee candle include:

*   High-quality wax for a clean and long burn.

*   Realistic and potent fragrance oils that accurately capture the essence of coffee.

*   A long burn time to maximize enjoyment and value.

*   A well-balanced scent profile that complements the coffee aroma with other appealing notes.

 ## Core Benefits

A well-chosen coffee candle offers several benefits beyond simply scenting a room. These benefits range from enhancing the atmosphere to improving mood and even increasing productivity.

**Enhanced Atmosphere**

The primary benefit of a coffee candle is its ability to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. The scent of coffee is inherently comforting and can transform any space into a cozy and welcoming environment. A coffee candle can be used to create a relaxing atmosphere in the living room, a productive atmosphere in the home office, or a welcoming atmosphere in the entryway. The flickering flame adds to the ambiance, creating a sense of calm and relaxation.

**Improved Mood**

The aroma of coffee has been shown to have a positive impact on mood. Studies have indicated that coffee can reduce stress and improve alertness. A coffee candle can provide similar benefits without the caffeine jitters. The scent can trigger positive memories and associations, leading to an uplift in mood and a sense of well-being.

**Increased Productivity**

The stimulating scent of coffee can also boost productivity. The aroma can sharpen focus and improve concentration, making it easier to tackle tasks. A coffee candle can be a great addition to a home office or study area, helping to create a productive and focused environment. Unlike actual coffee, the candle won't lead to a caffeine crash, allowing for sustained focus throughout the day.

**Odor Neutralization**

Coffee candles can also help neutralize unpleasant odors. The strong scent can effectively mask unwanted smells, such as cooking odors or pet odors. This makes them a practical choice for kitchens, bathrooms, and other areas where odors may be a concern.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have several questions when considering purchasing a coffee candle. Addressing these questions can help them make an informed decision and ensure they are satisfied with their purchase.

**What is the best type of wax for a coffee candle?**

The best type of wax depends on individual priorities. Soy wax is a popular choice due to its eco-friendliness, clean burn, and excellent scent retention. Coconut wax offers a similar clean burn and strong scent throw. Beeswax is a natural option with air-purifying properties, but it may not have as strong a scent throw. Paraffin wax is the least expensive option, but it is not as environmentally friendly and can release potentially harmful chemicals.

**How can I maximize the burn time of my coffee candle?**

To maximize the burn time, always trim the wick to about ÂΩï inch before each use. This prevents smoking and ensures a clean, even burn. Avoid burning the candle for more than four hours at a time, as this can cause the wax to overheat and the scent to fade. Keep the candle away from drafts, as this can cause uneven burning. Allow the candle to burn long enough for the entire surface to melt, which prevents tunneling and maximizes the wax usage.

**Are coffee candles safe for pets?**

Most coffee candles are generally safe for pets, but it's essential to take precautions. Avoid candles with synthetic fragrances, as these can irritate pets' respiratory systems. Choose candles with natural essential oils instead. Always burn candles in a well-ventilated area and keep them out of reach of pets to prevent accidental ingestion or burns. If you notice any signs of respiratory distress in your pet, discontinue use immediately.

**How strong will the coffee scent be?**

The strength of the coffee scent depends on the quality and concentration of the fragrance oils used in the candle. High-quality candles with a high concentration of fragrance oils will have a stronger scent throw. The size of the room also affects the perceived strength of the scent. A larger room will require a candle with a stronger scent throw to adequately fill the space. Reading reviews can provide insights into the scent strength of specific candles.

1k7jksz,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1k7jksz/uncover_the_truth_about_voraiya_moon_light/,Uncover the truth about Voraiya moon light therapy lamp in this detailed review!,"The **Voraiya Moon Light Therapy Lamp** has become my unexpected favorite gadget in the house. As someone who struggles with the dull, gray mornings of winter, I‚Äôve tried several light therapy lamps, but this one stood out in ways I hadn‚Äôt expected. Compact in size, beautifully designed, and packed with features, it has been a welcome addition to my living space.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

This product is undeniably eye-catching. The spherical design with a subtle moon-textured surface sets it apart from the industrial look of many light therapy lamps. It feels more like a decorative piece than a medical tool. I placed it on my desk, next to my laptop, and honestly, it‚Äôs the focal point of the space. The dimensions (5.91 x 5.91 x 6.93 inches) make it portable enough to move between rooms without taking up too much space. Whether it's on the bedside table or coffee table, the lamp looks stylish and sleek.  

**Functionality and Ease of Use**

From the moment I unboxed it, I appreciated how intuitive the setup was‚Äîthe lamp was ready to use within minutes. The remote control is a neat addition, allowing me to adjust settings from across the room. With this lamp, there‚Äôs no need to get up from the couch to press buttons, especially when I‚Äôm in my cozy zone. The remote also supports timer functions for 10 to 90 minutes, which ensures I don‚Äôt overuse it during therapy sessions. Losing the remote might leave you stuck with the last chosen settings though, as the lamp‚Äôs base only has a power button.  

[Time to see **Voraiya Moon Light Therapy Lamp** cost on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/link/b097xhkcsm/)

**Adjustable Options for Every Mood**

The level of customization was frankly surprising‚Äîin the best way. Three color temperatures ranging from warm (2700K) to cool daylight (6000K) and four brightness settings make this lamp versatile for any situation. For morning energy boosts, I use the cooler tones; in the evening, the warm yellow glow transforms the room into an inviting space. One evening, my roommate even used the golden-hued mode as an alternative to candles while unwinding. Whether used for therapy or ambiance, the combination of settings caters to both functional and decorative needs.

**Highlights**

- Stylish, spherical moon-themed design doubles as home d√©cor.  
- Adjustable brightness and color temperatures (2700K-6000K) suit different moods.  
- Remote control for effortless adjustments.  
- Timer option simplifies light therapy sessions.  

**Areas for Improvement**

While I genuinely love this product, it‚Äôs not without its hiccups. One notable issue: its claim of 10,000 lux brightness isn't entirely accurate; some light meters measured it closer to 8,600 lux. For an optimal experience, make sure to sit closer and perhaps use it for longer periods (45 minutes instead of the standard 30). Another thing that bugs me slightly is the lack of physical buttons for choosing different modes on the base.

- Brightness levels may fall short of the advertised 10,000 lux.  
- No physical controls for light settings; heavily reliant on the remote.  

**Challengers**

Comparing this light therapy lamp to others on the market reveals some interesting contrasts. Models like the Miroco Light Therapy Lamp might offer similar 10,000 lux brightness claims but often skip the aesthetic details. Lamps such as those from Circadian Optics lean more into contemporary designs but don‚Äôt offer the cozy feel of this moon-inspired light. In its favor, this lamp excels in versatility and portability (others tend to be bulkier). However, brands like Verilux have perfected brightness accuracy, which this lamp might not quite match. Despite that, Voraiya‚Äôs product feels multi-functional‚Äîboth therapeutic and decorative‚Äîwhich is rare.

**Financial Value**

For its features, I find this lamp to be worth the investment. It bridges the gap between effective therapy and stylish functionality. Many light therapy lamps feel clinical, and you‚Äôre essentially paying for a single benefit. In contrast, this product adds a decorative flair, doubling as a calming, mood-enhancing piece of furniture. It offers solid value for its price point while covering multiple bases.

When each member of the Starling family comes of age, coordinates appear on their wrists, leading them to their first case. It seemed unusual to Piper until she turned sixteen and numbers directing her to *Gibraltar Point Lighthouse* appeared.

¬†

She knew the story behind this lighthouse. It‚Äôs first keeper John Paul Radelm√ºller had been murdered there in 1815 by local soldiers. As to why he had been murdered there were two version. One saying John sold the soldiers diluted liquor and when finding out they had been cheated they went back for revenge. Another tells that he was serving the soldiers at his home and when he decided to close shop early a deadly fight ensued.

¬†

Nothing was concrete on how he met his true end. Though it would make for one hell of a ghost story if it was haunted. Piper knew the murder from the 1800s wouldn't be what she was meant to solve. She hoped so, at least. That morning, she packed her hiking gear, got into her 1972 AMC Gremlin, and headed towards her destination.

¬†

As for the *curse* or *gift* of the Starling‚Äôs. Piper wasn‚Äôt sure when it started or why.

¬†

Those who would know the answer aren‚Äôt around anymore. She started out at the vast stretch of road ahead of her listening to classic hits on radio. Piper drummed her fingers on the steering wheel then flicked the switch to turn right and onto a dirt road. Ahead of her was the lighthouse.

¬†

She gazed at the looming building ahead of her.

¬†

Piper felt the heavy weight of the situation heavily on her shoulders.

¬†

Finding a safe place to park the car Piper got out grabbing her bag and locked the car. She trudged up the path. It was overgrown except for a few manicured hedges lining the way winding up to the top. Here it was *Gibraltar Point Lighthouse*. She was sure that in its heyday this lighthouse was a sight to behold; now it was no longer operational. Piper took a deep breath and exhaled her eyes scanning over her surroundings.

¬†

She needed to set up camp. So, Piper pushed open the heavy wooden door of the lighthouse and entered inside. It had been well preserved inside showing it was well taken care of. Piper found a spot on the second floor and set up her pop-up tent. From here she would be able to access the telescope to view what was all around her.

¬†

Piper sat everything up and began her accent up the stairs. On the balcony was a rusty hanging on for dear life telescope. *Well at least the lenses aren‚Äôt broken* she thought to herself lifting its neck and peering into it. Moving it around Piper spotted something out of place. It appeared that someone had dug a trench in the back of the light house.

¬†

Curious she grabbed a flashlight and headed outside. Her boots crunched on dead leaves underfoot as she made her way towards the trench. There at the bottom of it was a pile of bodies all in various stages of decomposition.

¬†

This was a serial killer‚Äôs dumping ground.

¬†

Piper needed to call the police. Reaching for her phone she paused hearing something being dragged along the ground. Turning off her flashlight she hid behind an old oak tree. The source of the dragging came from an individual who was dragging a tightly wrapped body. Stopping at the edge of the trench they used their foot to kick the heavy bundle into the trench. It bounced off one of the many others which already lay at the bottom. A sickening squish and crunch echoed out of the hole.

¬†

This had to be who was dumping bodies into the trench. Taking out a compact mirror she kept in her back pocket to fix her make-up. Piper angled the mirror so she could the bank above the trench. Someone dressed in all black and a mask covering their face stood there staring down into the trench before turning on their heel and walking away.

¬†

It was at a time like this that Piper wished she had brought a proper weapon.

¬†

The use of pepper spray and taser could give her time to run away but not stun them long enough for authorities to arrive. Since she would be out here for a while Piper needed to hatch a plan to immobilize this serial killer and have the police stationed close by to make the arrest.

Her gut feeling told her that this was her first case. Something Piper would have to solve herself. Not hearing any more movement, she made her way back to the lighthouse and shut the door behind her.

¬†

Tossing and turning in her sleeping bag Piper stared up at the ceiling of her tent. She couldn‚Äôt sleep. It was understandable after all there was a hole with dead bodies in the backyard of the lighthouse. Who could sleep with something like that in their backyard? Sitting up Piper rubbed her face and yawned crawling out of the tent.

¬†

It‚Äôs time for some coffee since she wouldn‚Äôt be getting any sleep tonight.

¬†

Waiting for the kettle to heat up on a mini gas stove Piper shoveled a few spoonfuls of instant coffee and powdered creamer mix into a mug. When it whistled, she took it off and poured the water into her cup flipping the off switch. Stirring the mixture Piper blew on the steaming liquid before taking a sip. She walked up to one of the windows gazing out of it. Down below she saw an old trail leading somewhere out of sight.

¬†

If Piper had to guess it probably led to an old shed which stored tools, supplies and firewood. A knock on the front door of the lighthouse startled her. Her heart jumped into her throat as she shakily put down the coffee mug in her hands. Piper slowly walked over to a bag and took out her taser slowly descending the stairs. She hid the device behind her back slowly opening the door a crack.

¬†

Outside was a young man who appeared to be close to her age. He was dressed like he just jumped out of an 80s grunge magazine. Scrunching her nose at his taste in clothing Piper questioned him what he was doing here. He simply replied that he had seen a light while following a trail close by. In other words, he was nosey as to who was here.

¬†

Could this person be who Piper witnessed dumping a body earlier?

¬†

And‚Äîjust how many of those killed were his?

¬†

He gripped the door trying to pry it out of Piper‚Äôs grasp, so she put her foot and weight against the door. Again, she questioned what he was doing there. His eyes darkened and in a low voice he responded to her that *he knew* she saw him. Saw what exactly? Piper played dumb but she knew better. She just hoped that this individual would believe her.

¬†

Loosening his grip on the door he let go of it and stepped back. He watched her. Hands in his pockets his eyes dark and void of any emotion. He turned on his heel and walked down one of the trails next to the lighthouse. Piper knew that he wasn‚Äôt really gone and that he was probably going around to the back.

¬†

She would have to get there before he would. If Piper didn‚Äôt, she was sure he would break down the door. Somehow she felt that this young man knew. Knew that Piper saw what he had been doing and was going to silence her. Quickly shuffling down the stairs her heart hammered in her chest just as the back door burst open.

¬†

Piper cursed under her breath. Where could she go from here? She had to think fast before he closed in on her. As the young man stepped into the lighthouse Piper went right into the living room. Heavy thudding footsteps followed behind her getting close enough to grab her.

¬†

He reached out to grab Piper when she remembered the taser in her pocket. Turning her body, she flipped the on switch. Aiming it at the young man she pressed the button jamming it under his ribs. The sound of crackling filled the air and just as he was about to wrap his hands around her neck. His body jolted and shook bringing him to his knees.

¬†

Piper didn‚Äôt pull the taser away not until she knew he wouldn‚Äôt be able to get up.

¬†

Once he was down on the floor, she ran out the door making a beeline for her car. Piper fumbled with the keys of the car and managed to open it getting inside. Limping out of the house was the young man arm across his ribs as she started the engine and backed out of the driveway. Her foot accelerated on the gas, and she watched him using her rearview mirror.

¬†

¬†

Speeding out of the driveway like a bat out of hell. Piper fixed her eyes back on the road knuckles white from her grip on the steering wheel. She needed to put distance between them until she got a few miles away to call the police and her family. Piper never realized a second figure in the back seat of her car. Forgetting the most important rule she had been taught.

# Best Coffee Cup Sleeves 2025: Top Brands Compared

The humble coffee cup sleeve, often overlooked, plays a crucial role in enhancing the coffee-drinking experience. It protects hands from scalding temperatures, provides a comfortable grip, and, in some cases, even adds a touch of style to your daily caffeine ritual. As we head into 2025, the market offers a diverse range of coffee cup sleeves, each with its unique features, materials, and designs. This review compares some of the top brands, helping you choose the best option for your needs, whether you are a cafe owner, event planner, or simply a coffee enthusiast.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a coffee cup sleeve depends on several factors including the material, insulation, design, and environmental impact. The top brands offer a variety of solutions to cater to different preferences and requirements.

**Material:** The type of material used significantly affects a sleeve's performance and longevity.

The common material used is cardboard, specifically corrugated cardboard, which provides decent insulation and a textured surface for grip. Newer options include recycled materials, foam, and even knitted textiles. The durability of the material is important, especially when dealing with condensation or spills, so coatings and treatments that increase water resistance are desirable. The best materials strike a balance between functionality, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness.

**Insulation:** The primary function of a coffee cup sleeve is to insulate the user's hand from the heat of the drink.

The level of insulation is determined by the thickness and density of the material. Corrugated cardboard, for example, traps air between its layers, creating an insulating barrier. Sleeves made from thicker or multi-layered materials generally offer better insulation, allowing users to comfortably hold hot beverages for extended periods. The effectiveness of the insulation directly affects the user experience and prevents potential burns.

**Design and Customization:** The design of a coffee cup sleeve can range from plain and functional to elaborate and branded.

Many brands offer customizable sleeves that allow businesses to imprint their logos, slogans, or artwork, creating a marketing opportunity. The design also includes ergonomic considerations, such as the fit around the cup and the grip provided by the surface texture. A well-designed sleeve should securely fit a range of cup sizes and prevent slippage.

**Environmental Impact:** Sustainability is increasingly important to consumers, and coffee cup sleeves are no exception.

Many manufacturers are now offering sleeves made from recycled materials or sustainable sources. Some sleeves are also compostable or biodegradable, reducing their environmental footprint. Choosing eco-friendly options demonstrates a commitment to sustainability and appeals to environmentally conscious customers. The overall lifecycle of the sleeve, from production to disposal, should be considered when evaluating its environmental impact.

**Grip and Stability:** A good coffee cup sleeve should provide a secure and comfortable grip.

Textured surfaces, such as ribbed or embossed patterns, can enhance grip and prevent the cup from slipping. The sleeve should also fit snugly around the cup to prevent it from sliding up or down. Stability is especially important when carrying hot liquids, as it reduces the risk of spills and accidents. The overall design should prioritize both comfort and safety.

**Reusability:** While most coffee cup sleeves are designed for single use, some options are reusable.

Reusable sleeves are typically made from materials like silicone, neoprene, or fabric. They offer a more sustainable alternative to disposable sleeves, as they can be washed and reused multiple times. Reusable sleeves are a good option for individuals who frequently purchase coffee and want to reduce waste. They often come in a variety of colors and designs, allowing for personalization.

 ## Core Benefits

Coffee cup sleeves offer several key benefits, ranging from improved safety and comfort to enhanced brand image and environmental responsibility. Choosing the right sleeve can significantly improve the overall coffee-drinking experience.

**Enhanced Safety:** The primary benefit of a coffee cup sleeve is protecting hands from the heat of hot beverages. By providing an insulating barrier, the sleeve prevents burns and discomfort. This is particularly important for drinks served at high temperatures, such as freshly brewed coffee or tea. A well-designed sleeve allows users to comfortably hold their drinks without risking injury.

**Improved Grip and Stability:** A coffee cup sleeve enhances grip and prevents the cup from slipping, reducing the risk of spills. This is especially important when walking or traveling with a hot beverage. The textured surface of many sleeves provides additional friction, making it easier to hold the cup securely. A stable grip also reduces the likelihood of accidents and keeps the drink safe from unwanted movement.

**Brand Promotion and Customization:** Coffee cup sleeves offer a valuable marketing opportunity for cafes and businesses. Customizing sleeves with logos, slogans, or artwork can increase brand visibility and recognition. Branded sleeves can also create a more professional and cohesive image for the business. They serve as a subtle but effective way to promote the brand and reinforce its identity.

**Environmental Responsibility:** Choosing eco-friendly coffee cup sleeves demonstrates a commitment to sustainability and appeals to environmentally conscious consumers. Sleeves made from recycled materials, compostable materials, or reusable materials can significantly reduce waste. This is particularly important in the context of single-use items, which often contribute to environmental pollution. By opting for sustainable sleeves, businesses can reduce their environmental impact and attract customers who value eco-friendly practices.

**Enhanced Comfort:** Beyond just protecting from heat, coffee cup sleeves simply make it more comfortable to hold the cup. Condensation can make cups slippery or uncomfortable to hold and a sleeve eliminates that worry. A properly sized sleeve provides a secure fit, so you can hold your drink without focusing on maintaining grip.

 ## FAQs Section

Common questions that customers may have regarding coffee cup sleeves include their compatibility with different cup sizes, their heat resistance, and their environmental impact. Addressing these questions can help customers make informed purchasing decisions.

**Are coffee cup sleeves universally compatible with different cup sizes?**

While most coffee cup sleeves are designed to fit a range of standard cup sizes (typically 8oz, 12oz, and 16oz), the fit may vary depending on the cup's shape and material. Some sleeves are designed to be adjustable or expandable to accommodate different cup sizes. It's always a good idea to check the sleeve's specifications to ensure compatibility with your specific cups.

**How effective are coffee cup sleeves at preventing heat transfer?**

Coffee cup sleeves are generally effective at reducing heat transfer, but their effectiveness depends on the material and thickness of the sleeve. Corrugated cardboard sleeves provide decent insulation, while thicker or multi-layered sleeves offer better protection. It's important to choose a sleeve that provides adequate insulation for the temperature of your beverage. If you frequently drink very hot beverages, you may want to opt for a sleeve with higher insulation properties.

**What are the environmentally friendly options for coffee cup sleeves?**

There are several eco-friendly options available for coffee cup sleeves, including sleeves made from recycled materials, compostable materials, and reusable materials. Recycled cardboard sleeves are a good option for reducing waste. Compostable sleeves break down naturally in a composting environment. Reusable sleeves, such as those made from silicone or fabric, can be washed and reused multiple times, reducing the need for disposable sleeves.

**Can I customize coffee cup sleeves with my own branding?**

Yes, many manufacturers offer customizable coffee cup sleeves that allow you to imprint your logo, slogan, or artwork. Custom sleeves are a great way to promote your brand and create a more professional image for your business. Customization options may include printing, embossing, or debossing. Contact a reputable sleeve manufacturer to discuss your customization needs and get a quote.

It bounced off one of the many others which already lay at the bottom. A sickening squish and crunch echoed out of the hole.

¬†

This had to be who was dumping bodies into the trench. Taking out a compact mirror she kept in her back pocket to fix her make-up. Piper angled the mirror so she could the bank above the trench. Someone dressed in all black and a mask covering their face stood there staring down into the trench before turning on their heel and walking away.

¬†

It was at a time like this that Piper wished she had brought a proper weapon.

¬†

The use of pepper spray and taser could give her time to run away but not stun them long enough for authorities to arrive. Since she would be out here for a while Piper needed to hatch a plan to immobilize this serial killer and have the police stationed close by to make the arrest.

Her gut feeling told her that this was her first case. Something Piper would have to solve herself. Not hearing any more movement, she made her way back to the lighthouse and shut the door behind her.

¬†

Tossing and turning in her sleeping bag Piper stared up at the ceiling of her tent. She couldn‚Äôt sleep. It was understandable after all there was a hole with dead bodies in the backyard of the lighthouse. Who could sleep with something like that in their backyard? Sitting up Piper rubbed her face and yawned crawling out of the tent.

¬†

It‚Äôs time for some coffee since she wouldn‚Äôt be getting any sleep tonight.

¬†

Waiting for the kettle to heat up on a mini gas stove Piper shoveled a few spoonfuls of instant coffee and powdered creamer mix into a mug. When it whistled, she took it off and poured the water into her cup flipping the off switch. Stirring the mixture Piper blew on the steaming liquid before taking a sip. She walked up to one of the windows gazing out of it. Down below she saw an old trail leading somewhere out of sight.

¬†

If Piper had to guess it probably led to an old shed which stored tools, supplies and firewood. A knock on the front door of the lighthouse startled her. Her heart jumped into her throat as she shakily put down the coffee mug in her hands. Piper slowly walked over to a bag and took out her taser slowly descending the stairs. She hid the device behind her back slowly opening the door a crack.

¬†

Outside was a young man who appeared to be close to her age. He was dressed like he just jumped out of an 80s grunge magazine. Scrunching her nose at his taste in clothing Piper questioned him what he was doing here. He simply replied that he had seen a light while following a trail close by. In other words, he was nosey as to who was here.

¬†

Could this person be who Piper witnessed dumping a body earlier?

¬†

And‚Äîjust how many of those killed were his?

¬†

He gripped the door trying to pry it out of Piper‚Äôs grasp, so she put her foot and weight against the door. Again, she questioned what he was doing there. His eyes darkened and in a low voice he responded to her that *he knew* she saw him. Saw what exactly? Piper played dumb but she knew better. She just hoped that this individual would believe her.

¬†

Loosening his grip on the door he let go of it and stepped back. He watched her. Hands in his pockets his eyes dark and void of any emotion. He turned on his heel and walked down one of the trails next to the lighthouse. Piper knew that he wasn‚Äôt really gone and that he was probably going around to the back.

¬†

She would have to get there before he would. If Piper didn‚Äôt, she was sure he would break down the door. Some how she felt that this young man knew. Knew that Piper saw what he had been doing and was going to silence her. Quickly shuffling down the stairs her heart hammered in her chest just as the back door burst open.

¬†

Piper cursed under her breath. Where could she go from here? She had to think fast before he closed in on her. As the young man stepped into the lighthouse Piper went right into the living room. Heavy thudding footsteps followed behind her getting close enough to grab her.

¬†

He reached out to grab Piper when she remembered the taser in her pocket. Turning her body, she flipped the on switch. Aiming it at the young man she pressed the button jamming it under his ribs. The sound of crackling filled the air and just as he was about to wrap his hands around her neck. His body jolted and shook bringing him to his knees.

¬†

Piper didn‚Äôt pull the taser away not until she knew he wouldn‚Äôt be able to get up.

¬†

Once he was down on the floor, she ran out the door making a beeline for her car. Piper fumbled with the keys of the car and managed to open it getting inside. Limping out of the house was the young man arm across his ribs as she started the engine and backed out of the driveway. Her foot accelerated on the gas, and she watched him using her rearview mirror.

¬†

¬†

Speeding out of the driveway like a bat out of hell. Piper fixed her eyes back on the road knuckles white from her grip on the steering wheel. She needed to put distance between them until she got a few miles away to call the police and her family. Piper never realized a second figure in the back seat of her car. Forgetting the most important rule she had been taught.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The modern color changing cup incorporates several advanced features to ensure functionality and aesthetics.

**Thermochromic Pigments:** The core of any color changing cup is its thermochromic pigments.

These pigments are specifically engineered to react to temperature changes, causing a visible color shift. High-quality cups use pigments that offer vibrant and distinct color transitions, ensuring the visual effect is noticeable and appealing. Furthermore, the durability and safety of these pigments are crucial. The best cups utilize non-toxic and food-grade pigments that can withstand repeated use and washing without fading or leaching.

**Material Composition:** The material used in manufacturing the cup is vital for both its performance and longevity.

Many color changing cups are made from polypropylene (PP) or other BPA-free plastics, chosen for their heat resistance and durability. Premium cups might incorporate double-walled insulation to better maintain beverage temperature and enhance the color changing effect. Additionally, some cups feature a matte or textured finish for improved grip and aesthetic appeal. The quality of the plastic also influences the cup's resistance to staining and scratching.

**Design and Ergonomics:** The cup's design plays a significant role in its usability and appeal.

Ergonomic considerations include the cup's shape, size, and handle design, ensuring a comfortable grip and easy handling. The visual design, including the base color, the color change transformation, and any added graphics, contribute to its overall attractiveness. Cups with well-designed lids and straws minimize spills and enhance portability. Thoughtful design elements can significantly improve the user's overall experience.

**Temperature Sensitivity:** The range of temperatures that trigger the color change is a critical performance factor.

Ideally, the cup should react quickly and consistently to both hot and cold liquids. A cup that requires extremely hot or cold temperatures to activate the color change might not be practical for everyday use. High-quality cups are calibrated to respond within a reasonable temperature range, ensuring a noticeable and satisfying transformation with a variety of beverages. The consistency and accuracy of this temperature sensitivity are key differentiators.

**Durability and Longevity:** A good color changing cup should withstand regular use and washing without degrading.

Factors such as the quality of the materials, the adhesion of the thermochromic pigments, and the overall construction influence the cup's durability. Cups that are dishwasher-safe and resistant to cracking or fading will offer better long-term value. Manufacturers often conduct rigorous testing to ensure their cups can withstand hundreds of wash cycles and maintain their color changing properties over time.

**Safety Certifications:** Consumer safety is paramount, and the best color changing cups will carry relevant certifications.

These certifications, such as FDA approval or BPA-free labeling, ensure that the materials used are safe for food and beverage contact. Independent testing and certification processes verify that the cups meet stringent safety standards, providing consumers with confidence in their purchase. Brands that prioritize safety will prominently display these certifications on their packaging and product descriptions.

 ## Core Benefits

Color changing cups offer several tangible benefits to users beyond their novelty appeal.

**Enhanced Engagement:** The color changing feature captivates users, making drinking more enjoyable. For children, it can encourage hydration by turning a mundane task into a fun activity. Adults also appreciate the playful element, adding a touch of whimsy to their daily routines. The visual transformation provides a sensory experience that enhances overall satisfaction.

This can be particularly useful for parents preparing drinks for young children, providing a quick and easy way to gauge whether a drink is too hot. Similarly, it can help prevent accidental burns from overly hot coffee or tea. The color change acts as a built-in temperature indicator, enhancing safety and convenience.

**Personalization and Customization:** Many brands offer options for customizing color changing cups.

This includes printing personalized designs, logos, or messages on the cup's surface. This makes them ideal for promotional events, gifts, or creating unique keepsakes. The ability to personalize these cups adds value and allows users to express their individuality or promote their brand. Customization options are a key differentiator for brands targeting businesses or individuals seeking unique products.

**Improved Visual Appeal:** The dynamic color changes make these cups visually appealing and eye-catching.

This aesthetic enhancement can elevate the drinking experience, making it more enjoyable and satisfying. The vibrant colors and unique transformations create a visually stimulating effect, enhancing the overall ambiance. This is particularly appealing in social settings, where the cups can serve as conversation starters and add a touch of flair.

**Encourages Hydration:** Especially for children, the novelty of a color changing cup can make drinking water more appealing.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions about color changing cups is essential.

**Are color changing cups safe for children?**

Yes, most reputable brands use non-toxic, BPA-free materials and food-grade thermochromic pigments, making them safe for children. However, it's always best to check the product specifications and certifications to ensure they meet safety standards. Avoid cups with small parts that could pose a choking hazard for very young children.

**How long does the color changing effect last?**

The longevity of the color changing effect depends on several factors, including the quality of the thermochromic pigments, the frequency of use and washing, and exposure to extreme temperatures or sunlight. High-quality cups should maintain their color changing properties for several months or even years with proper care. Following the manufacturer's care instructions can help prolong the life of the effect.

**Can color changing cups be used in the dishwasher and microwave?**

It varies by brand and material. Some color changing cups are dishwasher-safe, while others require hand washing to protect the thermochromic pigments. Microwaving is generally not recommended, as extreme heat can damage the cup and affect the color changing properties. Always check the manufacturer's instructions for specific care guidelines.

**What types of liquids work best with color changing cups?**

Color changing cups are designed to react to temperature changes, so both hot and cold liquids will trigger the effect. The specific temperature range required for the color change may vary by brand. Water, juice, coffee, tea, and other common beverages are all suitable for use in these cups. The color change is often more dramatic with darker liquids, as they provide a greater contrast against the cup's base color.
