Had this account on the back burner for several years but due to time/family constraints I just haven‚Äôt been able to do anything with it. I hope to be as consistent as I can.


My aim would be to do weekly recaps of the YT channels that I‚Äôm watching anyway, open to requests on the ones I don‚Äôt currently watch. I‚Äôm pretty fluent in Duggar/Bates family history and would be geared more towards them. 


I‚Äôd be in keeping with the general tone of the sub, part snark ‚Äì part genuine curiosity on the dynamics of the huge families who are now growing their own.


We have our Queen DixCGirl10 and I would never step on her toes, this is a more detailed focus on YouTube to save clicks as I‚Äôd be watching most of them anyway, rather than their social media as a whole.

**Travis & Katie: ‚ÄúWE BOUGHT OUR DREAM HOME IN TENNESSEE!‚Äù**


Intro: Travis & Katie announce they are officially Tennessee homeowners. 


Flashback to earlier that week where they announce they have secretly bought a house, and at that point they are 3 days from closing. They have been driving by it 2-3 times a week and are so excited to get all the final paperwork done. The house looks awesome and also new for 2025, Travis is back playing basketball which he hasn‚Äôt done since moving to TN. They are in a parking lot outside a gym and we get the first of many mentions of Chomps this video. Cut to inside the gym and another look at Travis opening the Chomp, followed by shots of the Basketball game. The Bates parents showed up to the game and we hear Kelly Jo cheering in the background of some of the shots. (Interesting side note: All the banners in the gym are for the Red Devils, the irony!)


Back in the apartment, they tell Hailey they are buying a new house ‚Äútamarrow‚Äù. They are so excited and have been praying it works out after the last time (they had a secondary offer on a house but the primary offer went through) because Katie was excited then sad when it didn‚Äôt work out. As soon as they realized they were not getting the previous home, the search began again with Zach as their realtor. Zach sent the house listing, Travis hadn‚Äôt seen it despite obsessively checking house websites and apps for 6-12 months. This house has been on the market ‚Äúfor a little bit‚Äù and they believe the listing did not do the house justice due to missing rooms in the pictures and interesting angles, but that it worked in their favour as they loved it as soon as they seen it. They put an offer in on sight after trusting God to show them their house and if it wasn‚Äôt the one He would close the door. Zach called the next morning to congratulate them on being Tennessee homeowners, Travis faked out that they didn‚Äôt get it ‚Äì they wished they filmed this part. They waited to announce it due to closing times and various admin hurdles, but at this point they are now 24 hours from closing. They have a 10am walk through with Zach the next day once the owners have moved out. Travis says he has been watching them move out b/c he drives by the house often. The NJ house was purchased before they were even engaged so it‚Äôs the first time purchasing a home together. Michaela is coming over to babysit the kids so they can concentrate on the signing and are preparing clothes and snacks the night before (Spoiler: It‚Äôs Chomps). 
Travis clears up some toys for B Roll, then shows Hailey chasing Remy.
Cue the Chomps sponsorship. They cut to Gil Bates raving about Chomps too. I‚Äôm tired of typing Chomps at this point‚Ä¶


Closing Day 09:30am ‚Äì Carlin and Evan show up to the apartment with coffee and breakfast. Not entirely sure why since they are on their way out the door and Michaela arrives a minute later to watch the kids, but we move‚Ä¶


They arrive at the new house with Zach and you can see a detached double garage building with an upstairs (I‚Äôm guessing it will become a combination of gym/music studio/guest house), as well as a full garage on the house too. Outer of the house looks fresh white/black and interior is grey/white.


They are gushing over Zach for being the best realtor (based on the last video I kinda agree, Zach has been super invested in helping them and seems to genuinely care for Katie and her family, id be grateful to him too).


They arrive at Melrose Title Company early, Zach is there guiding them through the process, telling them the sodas will be the most expensive sodas they‚Äôll ever drink in their lives. They sign the papers and its official. Travis feels so much peace with this purchase and they are now ready to celebrate.


Zach and Evan are the only family members to have seen it at this point, so next we see Carlin and Evan watch Katie struggle to open the door, then Travis carries her over the threshold and there‚Äôs some B Roll of the main living space.


The following day they are preparing for the ice/snow forecasted for TN. They head to the house to show the kids and Kelly Jo and at least one other Bates kid. Hailey gets to see her room and asked if she wants it pink.


They show a small flash of the back garden which looks to have an enclosed outdoor porch area then Kelly Jo checks out the pantry (can‚Äôt wait to see 100 more Chomp or Thrive sponsors filmed there../s)
They end the video out with another huge Thank You to Zach and that next weeks video will be a sit down Q&A / House Update.

**The Stewart Fam: Looking back on a life with 19 kids! Gil Bates 60th Birthday Celebration!**


Opening: Evan & Carlin are in Pigeon Forge at Rowdy Bear Smoky Mountain Snow Park with their church. B Roll of Evan and Carlin on the tubes and the Avalanche Snow Coaster.


Next Zade is absolutely naturally sitting on one of 2 chairs in front of a camera, the other chair has the Thrive Market box ‚Äì I won‚Äôt recap the sponsored portions but shockingly, it‚Äôs for Thrive.

 
They are in the jeep to feel more ‚Äúcountry‚Äù for the family party at a cabin resort. They got back from Nashville the night before and are now repacked and ready for the Bates 60th Birthday/Post Christmas Party. They are car shopping at Cadillac since the previous family car was totalled. Carlin loved the ease of the Tesla and though she grew up driving 15 passenger vans she no longer feels comfortable with large cars since she didn‚Äôt drive for 2 years with her previous health issues. They are looking at Cadillacs, Lincoln Navigator and maybe another Tesla. They love the Cadillac, but it is huge for their family at the moment, and show the kids sitting in the back of one. Layla likes it better than the Tesla. 


They now go to Tesla and talk about how they are both indecisive but don‚Äôt feel like they need the Cadillac yet. No update just a hint/teaser that the Tesla dealership did not go as they had hoped.


At the Bates Celebration he flashes back to the night before where they went ATV off-roading (Muddin‚Äô ‚Äì who remembers that episode of BUB) then carol singing, presents for Grandkids.


Next day they are heading to Gil‚Äôs birthday and share that they bought him a new iPhone. Carlin says it‚Äôs a sentimental time and that ‚Äúmost all‚Äù of the siblings made it but 2 in Florida couldn‚Äôt make it (Alyssa and Jackson) and another sisters family got sick at the last minute (Josie).
We see Mama Jane (sporting a BSB sweater) taking in the view with Evan and asking how his parents are, she asks if his dad is still singing. Carlin comes over and says she‚Äôs just spotted Papa in his recliner asleep with a Western on and Jane replies ‚ÄúHe don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, I hate his crazy‚Äù which may have broken my heart a little but also the most Jane summary ever. Never take that woman‚Äôs Instagram away, I live for her comments.


Gil appears and Carlin and Evan heap praise on him for looking as good and in shape as he does at 60. Lawson and his spray on pants appear to say he‚Äôs ordering a new camera lens and he learns from the best (Evan).


There‚Äôs some B Roll of them all cooking out and taking pictures, Zade then helps Grandpa Gil with the hot dogs and burgers. More B Roll of Carlin with any sister but Erin, then Layla is at a crafting table before they eat. Zach / Lawson then share birthday praises about growing up with Gil and his dedication to working at a fair price to put food on the table for his family even when he could have and should have charged more.
Much of the next segment is Layla giving the present and then Carlin (the self proclaimed ‚Äúinsecure gift giver‚Äù) checking her Dad likes it because he had an iPhone Mini and this new phone is much bigger. His words were the only thing he loves better than a small phone is a free phone.


There‚Äôs some B roll and footage of the parents wearing blindfolds as all the kids take turns saying ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù and they have to guess who it is. Kelly is way quicker than Gil but it is a fun game when you have a million family members.


Outro: They loved the cabin and reminded Carlin of the good old days. It was chilled, the kids could play and then at nights they would meet up at other cabins and play cards. Upcoming for 2025: some car updates and Zade has upcoming speech therapy appointments. 

**Trace & Lydia: Papa Bates BIG 60th BIRTHDAY PARTY**

Intro: Quick preview of singing Happy Birthday to Gil Bates.


They too are getting ready to head to Gil Bates 60th Birthday party, Kelly Jo has been planning it for 6 months, most of the family are making it but it‚Äôs a 3 day getaway and they are hitting the road. 


They arrive to a cabin full of Bates, then the next day it is the birthday party day. Zach and Gil are grilling, it reminds Gil of the old days burning burgers. 


Ryker is loving all the mud and outdoor time and they say how many outfits they have to take. Trace asks Lydia how her first Bates party was back in the day  ‚Äì ‚Äúloud, a lot, couldn‚Äôt believe how many immediate family members there were‚Äù, but that it feels so long ago now.


Mama Jane is so excited to be there and credits ‚ÄúSweet Kelly Jo‚Äù for making sure they made it and loves seeing all the babies. Michaela is seen holding ‚ÄúHappy Alan‚Äù (Nathan and Esther‚Äôs baby who is actually called Graham) then Erin is miserable as Trace asks her if she‚Äôs moving back to TN. ‚ÄúNo.. maybe next year.‚Äù, and that she‚Äôs cried a lot about not moving back but they want to buy some land and build a house. Erin is thrilled when Trace says he and Lydia want to do the same and mentions several times they should do it together. William Payne is only 6 weeks younger than Ryker but the difference is huge, Ryker is roaming around while ‚ÄúWillie‚Äù is in the stroller.
Evan is admiring the camera set up and they talk about how its like the viewers are getting to attend because they will get several viewpoints through all the vlogs‚Ä¶ we might see Lawson‚Äôs some time in 2026. 


Lydia and Trace grab Kelly Jo to thank her for all the work she‚Äôs put into this trip. She credits the owners of the park as they go to church with them for allowing them to stay in several cabins.


Gil addresses everyone and thanks them for coming, for his life he doesn‚Äôt deserve and his family that have exceeded all his dreams. He prays over his Dad and then we cut to everyone making plates of food. 
They are out walking round the resort while Ryker is napping then we see B roll again of the family sharing praises on Gil, and then kids presents and the name game again (there‚Äôs only so many times I can recap the same footage!)

_______

If these are something you‚Äôd like me to continue, I‚Äôd be happy to do so.
I haven‚Äôt recapped Erin‚Äôs most recent video as I rarely watch hers and it is 9 days old at this point, and Alyssa‚Äôs ‚ÄúGoodbye.‚Äù video has already been so heavily discussed.


Have a great week,

1hy33ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1hy33ok/some_basics_for_beginners_i_suggest_taking_time/,Some basics for beginners. I suggest taking time to sit and grab a journal. ,"Hello everyone! I have seen a lot of questions about meditation that I get hung up on answering because I am so passionate about the inward journey, so I thought I would just make a post to share things you should know about meditation.
My intentions are to help anyone interested in the meditation practice, but to educate on what it's really all about.  
Going into it with the idea that it's just another thing to do like working out, without knowing these basics and just considering some breath work and mantra is going to be very limiting for you. 
Here are some must-knows about meditation.

1.Meditation is a Spiritual practice.
 
If the word spiritual is off putting to you,  think of another name for it is this, ""formless awareness.""
Here is an exercise to ponder on...

 Go back into your past, only Good memories.... Do this when you can take some time, close your eyes breathe and find some good ones...
What is the part of you that remembers and is aware of what it was to be 3 years old on a good memory? 
What part of you was present and aware when you were 12 and going through puberty? Can you find that same part of you that is aware of your body at the age you are now?

 This is your awareness, the part of you that is just aware, not identified with the conditions of what is happening with your age, your body or surroundings  and all of that at this moment. Because as you know, this age and present condition of your body is going to change...  further yourself on into the future. What part of you is it that will be aware if you are lucky enough to be an elderly person? 
If you can somewhat relate and find this part of you, you are on to what meditation is really all about. 

Some teachers refer to awareness is like the sky and then thoughts are like clouds passing by

2. It's important to know what the ego is and its function in the evolution of consciousness. 

The ego part of us is an absolutely necessary part that helps us to not only survive in the world but function as a seemingly separate ""person."" Btw, animals don't have one. That's why we want to be around them so much! 
So let's find your ego! If you were to tell someone about yourself as the way you see yourself, they may not see you that way, but that's the way you see yourself. That's your ego identity. Your name, age, gender, occupation, usually a bunch of negative stuff like unworthiness, and then some really overly confident thing like I'm the best at this or that. It's also the part of you that judges others and has hate for the oppositesband so on. 
For me, I'm a Mom and a Musician. I have identified heavily with those roles. But when I go down to McDonald's to get a coffee no one sees me like that.  They may just see a woman getting a coffee. I used to have to dress in a certain way where everyone knew I was a musician. When my kids started going off to college I freaked out and didn't know what to do with myself and that's when I became a musician. Here's where you can plug in the way you identify yourself.... 
In understanding this part of you you can understand your own suffering. When someone doesn't see us the way we want to be seen or the opposite we suffer. 
Suffering is there to show us where we are too identified with ourselves and we are meant to expand to accept new and more ways for ourselves.  For example,  me as a mother yes I'm a mother but I'm not only a mother so I didn't need to attach to only being a mother therefore I couldn't be other things. It is said that we can be everything!!

3. The real importance of Mantra.

When you say mantra a word or name for the Divine over and over, it's as if it fills in the space within your mind that would normally think.  So,  this gives you a chance to rise in your consciousness to be aware of that part of your mind. What's amazing is when you start with mantra after time it just starts doing it by itself and you will feel your expanded self(awareness) just watching it float by. You become more and more free.
Intrusive thoughts float by with no attachment, what someone said to you yesterday may come as a bothersome thought, it will just float by also, thus comes the Freedom!

4. You don't have to do breath work!  (But only if it just makes you happy) 

The goal is just to relax and to be with yourself, your real self. and to allow the lovely healing energies that are available within to flow and to enjoy your natural state of Being. 
If you've ever laid in the Sun in a relaxing way, or just relaxed in the beach, I suggest you adopt an idea about meditation in the same way as that. And I know people have a hard time relaxing at all, so to have a focal point is why any of that stuff is even so. Just follow your own guidance whatever works for you to relax!
Be mindful that the ego part of you is actually scared of the silence within and that's what all this resistance is about. The ego you is not wrong and some texts  will say that the ego must die and ego death and all of this but the ego is not to be hated upon.  It's part of us and we got here, so we should love it and nurture it and lovingly watch it. 
5. Lastly, the chakras
It's important to know that you have seven inner energy centers in your body. With adequate meditation practice you may feel sensations throughout different parts of your body. It's just where your body is relaxing enough to allow the inner flow to happen. Sometimes you can notice resistance or emotional pain in certain areas of your body and it is said that this one needs attention. The ultimate goal is to have all of your centers balanced and open placing your hand over your heart and another over your lower abdomen can help you to get more in touch with these sensations of the inner flow. 
You can do your own research to understand them more in depth and I am including a list of wonderful spiritual teachers who touch on all of these subjects that have helped me over the years! 

This is it for now.  I hope each one of you will try to incorporate these understandings and ask yourself you're true intentions about meditation and what it is you seek from the practice. 
Blessings to all!

I am 32F currently TTC and have subclinical hypothyroidism (not yet on meds just monitoring it) 

I decided to do a private blood test to check my iron levels (as low iron can be linked to subclinical hypothyroidism).

Results as follows:
Iron 26 umol/L -NORMAL
FERRITIN 20 ug/L - VERY LOW 

So even though iron is fine, my ferritin is low. I don‚Äôt really understand the difference between iron and ferritin but I would like to increase the ferritin!

My questions are‚Ä¶

- Is ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate or ferrous gluconate better? 

- is there a recommended ferritin supplement for those with IBS? I‚Äôve always had this and don‚Äôt want to make this worse with the iron supplement. 

- I currently take prenatal vitamins in the morning that contain a small amount of iron (15mg), zinc (15mg) and calcium (60mg)- I know these can interact with iron absorption? Is there best practice when to take these alongside the iron supplement? 

- Can I have tea or coffee a few hours after iron supplement? Or does it affect absorption? 

Thank you so much for your help üòä

Edit: hoemoglbin is normal and after some research I‚Äôm not sure having low ferritin only is anemia? So sorry if this is the wrong group. I don‚Äôt know the difference between iron and ferritin or if it indicates anemia or ‚Äòlow iron‚Äô- any help still greatly appreciated ‚ô•Ô∏è",1,1736510797.0,Anemic,0,1.0,False

1hy2wh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/morningmessage/comments/1hy2wh4/happy_friday/,Happy Friday ,"Good morning. Happy FEEL GOOD FRIDAY to you and yours. As we are expecting to get walloped by a snow storm in this area today, thought our FEEL GOOD FRIDAY story that I ran across that speaks of the cold weather would be perfect for our message this morning. 


The cold in the middle part of the country. The horrible fires on the west coast of the country. We‚Äôve got some prayers to offer for all who are hurting and suffering. 

Y‚Äôall stay safe. 

It was the coldest part of January several years ago. The jet stream had dropped and an arctic blast had arrived from Canada. The overnight temperatures had dropped below zero and the raw northern wind made it feel even colder. I had left my water dripping the night before but it had still frozen in the pipes. I sat outside then near the opening where the water lines came out of the ground and up into the house. I had run two extension cords through my back door to space heaters I had sat near the water pipes and was hoping they could get the water flowing again.
As I adjusted the heaters to get the warm air on the pipes the cold air of the day blew and sliced into me painfully. I saw the sun breaking through the clouds trying its best to warm the earth but the cold air of Winter was keeping it at bay, my pipes frozen, and my body shivering and hurting. My lips were chapped, my face felt raw, and my fingers were aching from the cold. Finally I went back inside. When I did I saw my loving daughter holding a steaming cup of coffee for me to drink. I smiled, took a sip, and let the liquid heat flow down my throat and warm my insides. I thanked my daughter for the cup and took another sip. And then I heard the most beautiful sound in the world: water flowing from the kitchen faucet.
As I went back out to carry the heaters back inside, I looked up at the sun and thanked God for a beautiful day, a beautiful world, and a beautiful life. As cold as it was I still felt the warmth of His Love shining through. Then I went back inside to hug my daughter and enjoy my coffee.
Sometimes this world feels like a very cold place. Sometimes it seems to do its best to keep the light, warmth, and Love of God at bay. But when we shine our light we can help God to drive away the darkness. When we share our warmth we can help God to take away the cold. And when we share our Love we can help God to melt the ice around another‚Äôs heart.

‚Ä¢Please pray for all impacted by the cold and the fires‚Ä¢‚ÄùBut just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written: ‚ÄúBe holy, because I am holy.‚Äù 1 Peter 1:15-16. Have a blessed day. 143!!!

T.G.I.F.
Thank God I‚Äôm Forgiven

1hy2w87,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hy2w87/im_pretty_sure_my_31f_husband_44m_is_a_narcissist/,Im pretty sure My (31f) husband (44m) is a narcissist if not something much more serious and I don't know what to do about it. Tl.DR I'm a rambler and cant help it.,"I 31f have been with my husband 44m for 15 years, and married for 8. But I'm pretty sure he's a narcissist at the very least and have no idea how to navigate this all from here on out... so logically I came to reddit to ask random strangers for their advice or opinions.  

So to catch back up 15 yrs married 8,  3 kids, 2 dogs and a cat together. So basically there is an entire tangled mess of a web that stands in the middle of us tying everything together In one way or another. Ex. we work at the same place and drive together to save money etc.  

To keep this relatively quick ( im lying it won't be quick.)  over all my husband isn't a bad guy...  or atleast he doesn't appear to be one.. he's a pretty great dad to our kids... genuinely. And when I look around to some of my friends partners in certain areas I'm honestly not that bad off... he'll make me coffee in the am and bring it to me bring me dinner etc.   but the more I learn the more I wonder if it is all just a facade. An appearance that he tries to maintain to control how people see him...  Because hears the thing. It may be apparent to all of you. And it kinda is for me now too. But when we first met I was 15. I didn't know half of these terms and if I did I of course didn't think it would ever happen to me. I was a teen-ager at the time and of course assumed I was above it all and was virtually invisible. 

I had moved out on my own at 15 because again i thought i was so dang smart...  i ended up dating a guy who was very abusive to me physically but we lived in the same house as my now husband and one day when things got physical he stepped in and put an end to it. He kicked my ex out of his house, and then told me i was welcome to stay as long as id like or need too. And for months I stayed in my room alone functioning as room mates, and to clarify it wasn't just us in the home there where multiple other roommates as well. I basically idolized him at this point despite being a mess...  he ""saved me"" or ""protected me"" and boom I was hooked... 

Anyways We started our relationship when I turned 16. And like everyone else in these situations say things where great it seemed like we where seemingly normal. Or as normal as could be. He had a very hard time witha addiction back then (is currently over 15yrs sober so no worries there) but most of my days where an absolute nightmare..  TL to get into. Just imagine a drunken drug addicted morbidly depressed person struggling through life and that's pretty much who he was at the time. Over the years he obviously got sober and (this is gonna sound so rude so please bear with me) he very very very slowly worked on him self. Over the years things where rough but no more than normal or what I thought was normal when in reality it was slowly getting worse and worse over time and I just hadn't noticed it. 

Things I thought he did to ""support me"" or to ""provide"" for the family I am now realizing where ways for him to control me in covert ways. Things like our money all needs to go together in one account because I can't budget because I'm just too immature to learn better. He does all budgets including product name and dollar amount. Now we are on a tight budget but rather than he go, he'll send me I'll have to call 1000 times to confirm I'm doing it right. Then turn around go home get introuble for spending too much or forgetting something amd then berated again the entire time I am having to bring it all in. All the bills had to be in my name from the very beginning of the relationship because he couldn't have them in his name (bad credit) gave me excuses about exes etc I was 15. He was... older than me...  well honestly he was an adult so I blindly believed him..  

Slowly my friend circle closed due to arguments falling apart etc but looking back almost 9 times out of 10 those random reasons always have one thing that link them...  he was involved in some part of it...  he'd work me up in private.... whisper little comments or like intentionally point things out to make that other person look bad..   and again I just blindly trusted his opinion. . He loved me. He wouldn't hurt me. 

My jobs are always around him... if he is he able to work? Then we work in the same industry the same job the same crew same town something close to eachother...  which he always sold as the closer we are the cheaper it is on gas... and he's not wrong....  but then the other things fall into place asking me about my schedules down to the minute... sold as wanting to be able to keep in tough throughout the day. Needing to know exactly who I'm working with. Keeping track of how long it takes me to get from work or to home or from the groceries how long it takes for gas etc. Always sold as wanting to know I'm safe. If he doesn't know I'm coming home how does he know when to start worrying or not...  what if I'm in the ditch?! He has full access to my phone at all times because I have nothing to hide but to clarify I also have access to his so he's always sold it as trust. But if he's on my phone he's making comments on who in talking too and what was said. Again nothing to hide it just shows he's scrolling through my conversations. If I use his it's like mine is downstairs and I wanna Google something quickly...  I need his flashlight...  maybe snapping a photo of the kids or answering a call from his mom.... where as he is again 9 times out of 10 going through my convos. We used to smoke cigarettes and weed. Both he controls 1000% down too how many smokes I get a day always sold as ""for budgeting"" but he wouldn't go without. Until he chose to quit. If I quit he'd still smoke. If he wanted to quit I wasn't aloud to spend anymore money on said item because it's not ""part of the budget anymore"" he used to berates me for how much I smoked etc and during one of our last arguments I said I didn't want him using my share of the money to by weed anymore as I was genuinely thinking of quitting and would rather manage my own purchases... he complained as we get a much better deal buying ""in bulk"" (more than 1 pack at a time or more than 10$ worth at a time) so I agreed to continue to do that as again ""it's for the budget"" but when he came home and I asked for my share a huge fight broke out. I am selfish I am just looking to fight. What's wrong with me for not just letting this go. I'm so immature I can't even help my self but argue over petty shit and so on. But then I basically caught him giving me the lesser quality and no oil. He tried keeping it all for him self almost as a way to teach me a lesson... The next time the same thing happened but I stood my ground and demanded my share...  well low and behold he ran out 4 times before I did. (I kept giving him more) so he had to go shopping again recently and I asked again for my share and you guessed it he threw the same fit I said why does it bother you so much.. why are you still on this... he said its because it's his thing that he usually deals with it. 

And it just made me think that he really isn't kidding when he says He doesn't ""handle emotions well"" (his words) so any time I have been sad or upset or crying or overwhelmed or asked for clarification accountability or closure he has gotten mad at me or frustrated or has been completely distant. He has always sold this as he has tramas and can't help it. (again please bear with me again because at first this will sound rude) but every major issue is a result of a ""trama"" and is something he can't help. He can't help getting mad. He can't help the way he talks to me. He can't help that he's triggered by me asking questions.. 

Our entire relationship this man has done things to look good to others and then would rip me apart behind closed doors. I hit a major depression after my last child was born it was such a debilitating bout of post partum depression that I couldn't get out of my house for 6 months.. spending the majority of my time hiding in my room. I took care of the kids. Maintained their schedule etc but i was so so morbidly depressed the rest started to fall apart. The house. The yard work. The shopping. The appointments. Everything started falling apart. So he started picking it all up.... he was coming home sometimes on lunch with a few work friends and would make them all a sandwich or some soup or what ever and quickly tidy or set me up with stuff if I needed it etc (at first I was healing from an emergency csection) and then would go back to work. Then
 he had friends who would come back after work he would clean cook dinner do baths or what ever. But as soon as people would leave he'd basically just drop. And I get that he would be tired. But eventually helping me caring for me dealing with me was something he constantly would chew into me for. How my depression is a burden, how clearly I couldn't manage on my own. How I am a sad excuse of a mother if I can't even take care of my self how can I care for them and so on.  

Any time people are around he's on his game.. I throw huge birthday parties. For our kids and some of our friends (they pay me a little for my time and cover the expenses but usually im happy to do it for their kiddos ) I spend months prepping for them etc he is never willing to help me (which is my choice to accept but he says it so condecentently) 

ex. Me: Hey babe can you hold this really quick while I measure it. Him: no me: cmon hon just for a sec I'll be quick. Him: huge sigh*  I didn't say I'd do this stupid party. I don't know why you always say you'll do shit like this and then try to get me to help. 

But then when the party rolls around and there are people there helping set up or prep he is on the ball running all around ""helping"".  people then spend all day long complementing him. Telling him what a great job ""we"" have done. And he will stand there and soak it all up. ""Oh my gosh your kids are so lucky to have you"" ""look at all the work you've done!"" ""Man your wife sure is lucky to have a guy like you"" ""your a super dad!"" Mean while every other day of the year he is in his room playing his game off and on all day long. 

See the thing is unless it's something he wants to do he literally doesn't care how bad you wanna go. He'll just look at you blankly in the face and go yeah but it just really doesn't interest me. If you try to persist he gets ruder I just don't care about it. Can't you just drop it. I don't know why you can't just let shit go. Why do you always have to fight etc and I'm just like well... I just wanted to go out and play some cards or go dancing or a small concert or comedy meet etc. Which means he's the same with the kids. And again to clarify it's not that he's bad to them. As soon as it's summer he loves lake river or beach days so they go non stop. Literally every single day I get off work they are off on some adventure. But if it's say.... gymnastics he doesn't want to go. Play dates. Park days. But he love tabogganing in the winter. See what I'm getting at here? He could so easily have a great personal relationship with them because he is so close to one already but he's not willing to work on it. Just says he can't handle emotions that they want to do things that don't interest him and that I'm setting him up for failure if I do ""make him go"".

Speaking of work he doesn't really work much at all...  in our entire relationship he hasn't been able to keep or find a job unless it was through a friend. Not even exaggerating every single job he's had since I've been with him has been that way. No job has lasted more than a year or two max. And many many jobs have ended because he ended up arguing with someone there like an employee or the boss which then made things so awkward for me that eventually I'd have no choice but to leave and find other work. 

If he ends up ""depressed"" (he started saying this as soon as I started showing him real proof that I wasn't making these  things up he never once before said he had depression and up till that point mocked me for strugglign with it so it seemed so black and white it gave me whiplash) anyways he just stops working. And I am then left to pick up the entire slack. And this has happed for years and years and years.... hell work for a bit... and then not... and then hell get a day or two and then nothing and then go back for a few weeks. And its just like i have no choice Despite having debilitating mental health my self. Truthfully. The last time he decided to stop working he told me I had to maintain 5x10s inorder to cover the rent and bills or I quote ""we will sink"" or ""our family will starve"" so im left working every day all day long while living in unbearable anxiety. as he's sitting in his gaming chair playing with his friends all damn day long laughing and having a great time.

 And I get that depression doesn't always look the same. I have been chronically depressed for as long as I can rememebr...  so I really do understand that it can manifest in various ways.  But the reality is most of the time he's not depressed. I can feel it off of him. We've been together for 15 years. It's not that simple as him lying and me just believing it. But either way last year he basically didn't work at all. We normally take the winters off but for two years in a row now I've had to work right through the winters. Which I'm willing to do. I'll push my self to my breaking point every single time if I have to too keep ym family afloat. The days he did work he worked fuller days then I am able too so in the end he actually managed to get the same about of work when not even getting 5 paychecks for the year.... I could be wrong but really truly he got basically nothing this year as far as an income. And last year was practically the same. 

((We ended up working different jobs and hours so I could come home to get the kids after school and he'd continue to work fuller days) ended up having him chase me out of my job saying it would be better if I found work closer to home.) 

So I found a part time work I'd be able to split the shift with as my old boss was great to me and I didn't want to leave I just wasn't being given a choice so I was doing my best to keep everyone happy...  right away I'm told we can't afford the gas and I just have to ask this new boss if I can have full time-ish hrs instead. We'll within 4 months he's back to barely working my old boss messages me all pissed that I left him high and dry this year. I felt horrible. But once again my husband wasn't working and he's telling me I can't afford to drive out there so I'm stuck at this new job. (Which ended up being an amazing job thankfully but thats besides the point. ) 

Aaaanyways fast forward to now...  I've been working on my mental health the same as him.. but I am working on current and present issues while he is focusing on his childhood etc. I not shooting that down but his emotions have truly gotten worse with him having to unpack that stuff and in my head if it's making right now worse is it really for the best. They all keep saying yes he needs to work through it. And I agree...  but also what about me? 

He's not the only one with trama. We both have alot of the same conditions. Cptsd, anxiety and depressive disorders and more. But no one is even considering or acknowledgomg the very real trama i have from this relationship alone. The shit i had to see in his active addiction. Caring for a man who wouldnt and couldnt even get up. Who couldnt be bothered to clena him self. The fact that im a walking trama responce. The way my nervous system reacts to the way he is in any given moment. if I have a moment where I zone out after he's been yelling or I get forgetful after a day of us fighting then I'm an idiot what the fuck is wrong with me etc. But if he gets mad at you for crying or gets mad because of you asking a question it's because of his tramas he can't help it and im selfish for expecting him to even try. I mean how dare me. He tried to blame all my stuff on my childhood which I know alot is...  but currently I'm basically the same time in this relationship as I had out of it. I've been living in this since I was 15 and somehow no one is even considering the hell it really can be living with someone like this. 

So over time they've added diagnoses to both of us. He was originally labeled as generic anger management issues along the other things I've already mentioned... then the more they talked they suspected narcissistic personally disorder (honestly pretty  concerning in its self) but most recently they have settled on antisocial personality disorder. Otherwise previously known as a phsociopath. 

I have googled and googled... please do the same before commenting... if you've made it this far I guess... 

I just don't know what to do...  for years if I have had enough and said I can't handle these ups and downs with you etc. He says don't give up on me I've come so far ex. Quitting drinking... quitting drugs... quitting smoking... finally agreeing to counseling.... actually going to counseling etc.... the problem with these things is they actually made no difference to the main issue I've had for years... the way he treats me...  problem is is obviously we have kids... and pets and bill payments and everything else... so the finer details are hard.... I've looked for years... I can't find any rentals I could even possibly afford on my own...  our budget is quite literally maxed with both of our monthly incomes baby bonus and my work hrs. So I genuinely couldn't afford a place here on my own. Or atleast I feel like I can't...  I don't want to take his kids away from him. They love him... and he really isn't bad to them..   he really is a decent dad over all. Compared to some dad's I've seen that is so I don't think that's fair. I think? I think he's a good dad... really. It's the only reason I've stayed... I really thought/ think he's a pretty good dad... 

Anyways I've tried to stay In the house  as ""roommates"" which is impossible. .  Habits set in i accidentally  call him babe or hon or love and to him that means everything is fine... if I try to bring it back up it's again I can't help my self I'm giving him mixed signals I just can't let it go etc...  he spins the conversation around until I feel like I don't have a solid leg to stand on. 

What the fuck do I do guys? I've slept in my truck more days than I'd like to admit. Bc I can't live like this...  but have no choice... literally no choice... I'm stuck. Shelters are full... there's a housing Crisis... there are no subsidized housing...  most places are 55+ only (have to be 55+ to live in the park or building) most don't accept kids and pets. (They keep saying kids do more damage than any pet theyve allowed but definitely wouldn't allow both) I can't guarantee the same work for the same amount anywhere else... my kids are in school and extra curricular so i would prefer to keep them in their school with their friends etc...  

I just truly don't know what to do...  how do I do it... I keep looking for rentals but I just can't find anything in my budget...  like at freaking all... I'm so frustrated. 

Because the more I learn the more research I do the more I feel like he's been playing me this entire time...  every little thing he's done has been to control me...  everything..  and I just don't even know how to feel.... 

Again I'm not trying to sound 100% innocent... I do have severe mental health...  but he'd definitely used the line ""who would even be willing to deal with your crap"" and I've certainly been toxic during arguments etc. To be completely transparent I have gotten so bitter and hurt from it all I've gotten vicious to him... I don't care about how he feels or if he's hurt I don't sympathize with him any more as he's never not once done that for me...  he doesn't have empathy for anyone... so he says that proves I'm the narcissist not him.. but yet he doesnt care about anyone but him self like at all...  he doesn't give me hugs when I'm sad he walks away...  I am not perfect by any means...  but I'm starting to wonder if maybe I could figure it out on my own...  I may not be great with budgeting...  but maybe I can learn to be better...  I don't actually think I'm stupid most of the time... only when he's beating me down.... maybe I can  become a better cook if I can learn without someone getting mad at me for mistakes made and food waisted...  maybe I can manage appointments and schedules when my brain isn't fuzzy all the time from being overstimulated and spun around in circles. I don't get upset anywhere else like I get upset with him.... so what if I could have a quieter life. One where I'm not constantly reminded how ...  inconvenient i am without actually using the words. 

He always gets me like that... I didn't call you stupid mean while he asked me if I even know what ________ex. A sharpener* does. I don't know how you'd honestly think that. I don't know why I have to do everything for you. Could you even live on your own do you even know what a budget is? It's always some way of saying something mean without actually saying the mean thing.... but it's abundantly clear he's insinuating it. 

I don't know guys...  maybe I am the problem? Again I'm not perfect..... but after it all I'm wondering if maybe just maybe he ..... groomed me(?) I was 15... (?) Maybe not? I was also a very opinionated young woman.... i definitely ""wanted him"" all on my own.... but he would have been..... 28ish? Sorry I know my numbers are all over... if I'm being honest there are entire gaps of time... nearly entire years that are a blurr unless someone mentions a memory and it'll come to the surface for a moment before disappointing behind the fog once again .... 

Uuuugh I guess I just needed a place to dump this....  thanks for getting hear if you did...  I appreciate you caring enough to read this novel of my life that is just an absolute ficking mess...

1hy2vj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1hy2vj7/why_blrx_biolinerx_could_be_your_next_best/,Why BLRX (BioLineRx) Could Be Your Next Best Investment,"Alright kids!!!!, let‚Äôs talk about BioLineRx ticker symbol: (BLRX), I know someone else made a post about this stock a few days ago but this is a more in depth observation almost like reading one of those books ""how to for dummies"". This biotech underdog is out here trying to save lives and your portfolio. If you‚Äôre into high-risk, high reward plays that make you feel like a Wall Street genius when they pay off, then pull up a chair. Here‚Äôs why BioLineRx will excite you and might just be worth your hard-earned cash without needing any viagra. 



1. It‚Äôs a Biotech Brawler

BioLineRx is going head to head with cancer and rare diseases. Their star product, APHEXDA, is designed to help cancer patients, which means they‚Äôre not just making money they‚Äôre potentially saving lives. So if you‚Äôre looking for a feel-good investment that might also make you feel rich, this could be it.



2. The Partnership Hustle

BioLineRx just partnered with Ayrmid Ltd. to let someone else handle the business side of things while they focus on their science experiments. It‚Äôs the corporate equivalent of outsourcing your least favorite chore like letting someone else do your taxes while you dream about how to spend your refund. Smart move.


3. From Zero to (Almost) Hero

A year ago, BioLineRx‚Äôs revenue was so nonexistent it made tumbleweeds look busy. Fast forward to Q3 2024, and they‚Äôre pulling in $4.9 million. Sure, they‚Äôre still not exactly swimming in cash, but progress is progress. Additionally, the net loss narrowed from $16 million in Q3 2023 to $5.8 million in Q3 2024, demonstrating better financial management and operational efficiency.


4. Analysts Are Hyped!!

Some big-shot analysts think BioLineRx is the next big thing, slapping a price target of $9.00 on the stock when it‚Äôs currently trading at, uh, $0.14. That‚Äôs right, if they‚Äôre right, this could be the stock market equivalent of finding a Picasso at a garage sale. If the company continues to execute its strategies effectively, the stock could experience substantial growth.



5. They Just Got a $10M Boost

BioLineRx raised $10 million in a direct offering, which means they‚Äôve got cash to keep the lights on and the scientists caffeinated. Now, whether that money turns into blockbuster treatments or just pays for a lot of lab coats remains to be seen but at least they‚Äôre not running on fumes.



6. A Pipeline Full of Possibilities

Their clinical pipeline is packed with potential, targeting cancer and rare diseases. If one of these treatments hits the jackpot, it‚Äôs not just a win for patients but it‚Äôs a win for your portfolio. Its focus on oncology, a field with high demand and growth potential positions the company as a valuable player in the biopharma space. Success in late-stage clinical trials could act as a catalyst for significant stock price appreciation.



7. The Market Is Massive

The global oncology drug market is projected to hit $250 billion by 2030, which means there‚Äôs a lot of money up for grabs. BioLineRx has the opportunity to capture a share of this rapidly expanding market.



8. It‚Äôs Cheap as Dirt Right Now

At a stock price of around $0.14, this is about as close as you can get to investing pocket change. Sure, it‚Äôs risky, but if the stock ever gets anywhere near those analyst targets, We will all be on here posting our gains and finally you can make your wife happy again. Worst case? You‚Äôre out the cost of 2 weeks of your Starbucks coffee's. Best case? You‚Äôre the next Warren Buffett.


Bottom Line

I just like the stock. The upside is too good to ignore. Do your own DD. Love you guys and I'll see you boys at the top! ",2,1736510455.0,pennystocks,1,1.0,False

What started as a way to relax ended up with me nearly finishing a different project ‚Äî *VetControl*.

It‚Äôs a lighthearted game where you play as a veterinary inspector on a space station. Your job is to ensure alien pets are parasite-free and ready for their intergalactic flights. Inspired by my own experiences in vet clinics (and a bit of imagination), the game combines humorous vibes with simple mechanics.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs in the mix:

* Chill (but slightly wacky) atmosphere.
* Tools like flamethrowers, UV lights, and gas to tackle alien parasites.
* Alien pets that need specific treatments (no random guessing here).
* A radio with custom tracks to make work more enjoyable.
* And Joe, the toothy space plant who steals your fries and coffee while you‚Äôre working.

1hy2n1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/autonomi/comments/1hy2n1c/net_neutrality/,Net Neutrality,"Our Chief Strategy Officer, Jim Collinson shares his perspective on Net Neutrality  
  
""Ok. So, Net Neutrality ‚Äî in the birthplace of the Internet, America, at least ‚Äî is dead.  
  
It was sacrificed by the courts, on the altar of corporate profits.Let me explain why you need to pay attention (and I‚Äôll let you in on a sneaky plan)-  
  
But first, what even is Net Neutrality, and why should you care? Well, it‚Äôs something that we‚Äôve all quietly become accustomed, and we are about get a taste of life without.  
  
It‚Äôs the set of laws that say your ISP can‚Äôt discriminate against different types of Internet traffic that go in and out of your home.Your Netflix streams, online gaming, work emails, Amazon transactions, your own personal blog, that mom-n-pop estore, data backups, your hipster coffee AI bean hydration analysis database.  
  
Doesn‚Äôt matter. It all has to be treated the same. Well, except now it doesn‚Äôt---You ISP can now take a look at all that traffic and (legally) decide on what‚Äôs most important to \*them\*.  
  
Because they can see all the sites and services you visit, they can create fastlanes for some, and crush slow lanes for others. So the video streaming service they are invested, showing the films they want you to see, is slick and speedy, while other platforms enter buffering hell.--  
  
\-Oh and it gets worse! No more Net Neutrality means they can even out right block their competitors. Or tamper with what you see within websites ‚Äî all while getting backhanders from companies set to profit.They are the gatekeepers of everything now.  
  
So what‚Äôs the answer? What can possibly be done??---  
Encryption. Encryption. Encryption.  
  
If the courts have washed their hands of data equality ‚Äî it‚Äôs time that equality was enforced via technology.  
  
Because all data is equal when it all looks the same, and the ISP can‚Äôt take a peek even if they wanted too.---

The Science Behind Teeth Whitening Transformations

Teeth whitening is more than just a cosmetic procedure ‚Äì it's a scientific process that removes stubborn stains and discoloration. The most effective treatments use specialized whitening agents that penetrate tooth enamel, breaking down complex stain molecules and revealing a brighter, whiter smile.

How Teeth Become Discolored

Understanding why teeth become stained is crucial to appreciating the dramatic before and after results:

- Coffee and tea consumption
- Smoking and tobacco use
- Aging and natural enamel wear
- Certain medications
- Genetic factors

Professional vs. At-Home Whitening: A Visual Comparison

Professional teeth whitening typically produces more dramatic before and after photos compared to over-the-counter solutions. **Professional treatments can lighten teeth by up to 8-10 shades**, while at-home methods might only achieve 2-3 shade improvements.

I need some advice and possibly some enthusiastic dodgy maths. I bought a sage oracle touch in 2018. This was for home use (4 coffee drinkers - Flat whites, Lattes and occasional espresso.)

nearly 3 years later that machine started to over heat and was out of warranty. I was wrongly told that repairs were not possible (and we were in first lockdown) so I bought another one.

New information came in and turns out the first machine could be repaired. All good. That machine was repaired and put back in use until this week when it started tripping main house fuse every time it is switched on. Repair will be around ¬£500- ¬£550

So I go and get the other machine out of storage and that one was missing the tamper fan and the connection to the grinder. No one in the house knows whyüòë. So I replace those parts. But the grinder is only giving 17G of coffee and no matter what I change it stays there. Quite often there is a build up of coffee behind the tamper fan.

For info, The machine had not been used for over 3 and half years and for a year and half was stored in a garage for half that time.

Options - Repair both machines estimated repairs - ¬£850 to ¬£900 guessing about parts (includes shipping). Repair one machine estimated repairs - ¬£500. Or accept that both machines are 4 years or more older and they will become more unreliable so buy a new machine for around ¬£1,500.

Would welcome any thoughts.

thanks

- **A fellow night owl** who doesn‚Äôt mind burning the midnight oil (or at least the 10 PM‚Äì2 AM oil).

1hy29nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/seinfeld/comments/1hy29nu/chatgpt_gave_me_a_modern_seinfeld_episode/,ChatGPT gave me a modern Seinfeld episode,"Title: The Algorithm

Premise: The episode revolves around how the four characters react to modern technology, algorithms, and social media trends, each getting tangled in increasingly ridiculous situations that all converge by the end.

Jerry:
Jerry gets obsessed with an AI-powered joke-writing tool after a set bombs at a comedy club where everyone‚Äôs face is buried in their phones. The tool generates hyper-personalized jokes based on audience data. At first, it works, but soon the AI‚Äôs jokes get too personal, referencing audience members‚Äô embarrassing online histories, causing outrage. Jerry‚Äôs career is threatened when a TikTok user posts a video titled ‚ÄúSeinfeld Ruined My Life.‚Äù

George:
George, after being ghosted on a dating app, becomes convinced he‚Äôs been ‚Äúshadowbanned‚Äù due to an unflattering profile picture. He creates multiple fake profiles with various names like Art Vandelay Jr. and Jorge Costanzo. In typical George fashion, he accidentally catfishes himself, matching with a bot using his own bad picture, sparking a downward spiral of paranoia.

Elaine:
Elaine is trying to become an influencer for an organic toothpaste brand she doesn‚Äôt even use but claims she loves for the sponsorship money. Her attempts at viral content keep failing ‚Äî including a disastrous ‚ÄúGet Ready with Me‚Äù video where she spills toothpaste all over herself. She starts faking engagement with bots, but the bots only comment things like ‚ÄúNice teeth! Click here for crypto!‚Äù

Kramer:
Kramer invents a bizarre ‚Äúreal-life algorithm‚Äù called The Kramer Konnection where he matches people in real life for networking, believing face-to-face connections have become a lost art. He begins ambushing people on the street, forcing them into spontaneous ‚Äúnetworking sessions‚Äù where they swap LinkedIn details. This ends in him getting banned from multiple coffee shops for causing chaos.

Final Tie-In:
	‚Ä¢	Jerry, desperate to save his career, has Elaine promote his next comedy show using her struggling influencer page. Unfortunately, most of her followers are still bots, so the crowd is just a weird mix of crypto scammers and toothpaste enthusiasts.
	‚Ä¢	George, still catfishing himself, shows up to the show, realizing his own profile has been projected on the screen as part of Jerry‚Äôs ‚Äúpersonalized‚Äù jokes, humiliating him in front of the crowd.
	‚Ä¢	Kramer bursts in mid-set, trying to connect Jerry with a ‚Äúhigh-profile comedy scout‚Äù who turns out to be another bot from Elaine‚Äôs fake engagement boost.

The episode ends with all four characters sitting in the diner, baffled by how algorithms have taken over their lives. George is still messaging himself, Jerry‚Äôs AI joke app is canceled for privacy violations, Elaine loses her sponsorship, and Kramer insists his real-life algorithm will be the future.

But what's in those creamer pods? Is it just condensed milk or something else?

What makes the standard creamer pod different to the flat white pod? And the cappuchino pod? Is it purely the amount of water that gets added?

Also are there variations in the way the machine works or is it SOLELY based on amount of water? I understand the barcode tells the machine what to do, but is that just how much water to add? Or does it do different things like speed, a different pattern of expulsion, some way of creating more/less foam?

I've bought a reusable pod to use with the machine, it works well with ground coffee - very well indeed. I read in passing on the site that you can fill it with milk (halfway up) or powdered milk too. I tried normal semi-skimmed milk and the results were awful, thin, pale water, no foam. Does it need to be condensed milk? Or evaporated milk or will full fat milk work?

There's next to nothing out there about creamers and pods and coffee machines, so I'm keen to learn! And leave a resource here for other people who are curious too.",1,1736507888.0,cafe,0,1.0,False

1hy20ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/MinimalScreenLife/comments/1hy20ro/is_excessive_screen_time_ruining_your_social_life/,"Is Excessive Screen Time Ruining Your Social Life?
","Nowadays,  screen time has become an unavoidable part of daily life. However, excessive screen usage can have a significant impact on our social interactions, leading to a range of issues that affect relationships, communication, and overall well-being. Let‚Äôs explore how spending too much time in front of screens can harm your social life and how tools like screen time reducer apps can help mitigate the damage.

# The Social Impact of Excessive Screen Time

1. **Decreased Face-to-Face Interaction**
   * When we spend too much time on screens, especially on social media or entertainment apps, we tend to neglect face-to-face conversations. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from family, friends, and colleagues.
2. **Shallow Online Interactions**
   * Although technology allows us to stay connected through messages and video calls, these interactions often lack the depth and emotional connection that in-person communication provides. Constant use of screens for socializing can result in superficial relationships.
3. **Social Anxiety**
   * Ironically, excessive screen time can lead to increased social anxiety. Constantly scrolling through social media and comparing oneself to others can foster feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and depression, which can affect your ability to engage confidently in real-world social settings.
4. **Reduced Emotional Intelligence**
   * Spending too much time on devices can hinder the development of empathy and emotional understanding. These skills are often honed through face-to-face interactions, where we can read body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice‚Äîthings that are absent in many online interactions.

# How to Reclaim Your Social Life

1. **Set Boundaries with Technology**
   * Limit your screen time by establishing rules such as no screens during meals or before bed. This encourages more direct communication with people around you.
2. **Use Website Blockers and Distraction Blockers**
   * Implement **website blockers** to cut off access to distracting apps or websites that prevent you from engaging with others. Tools like **distraction blockers** help you stay focused on real-world socializing rather than getting lost in the digital world.
3. **Prioritize Quality Time**
   * Make time for in-person interactions, whether it‚Äôs meeting up with friends for coffee or having a family dinner without any screens involved. Disconnecting from technology gives you the chance to reconnect with people on a deeper level.
4. **Practice Mindfulness and Digital Detox**
   * Taking regular breaks from your devices, whether through a digital detox day or a few hours each week, can help you recharge emotionally and socially. Use this time to engage in activities like hobbies or outdoor adventures that don‚Äôt involve screens.
5. **Engage in Real-Life Social Activities**
   * Join clubs, attend events, or take part in activities that promote face-to-face interaction. This helps you expand your social circle and strengthen relationships that aren‚Äôt reliant on screens.

# Conclusion

Excessive screen time is a silent threat to our social lives, eroding meaningful connections and leaving us feeling disconnected. By recognizing its impact and implementing strategies like using **website blockers** and **distraction blockers**, we can regain control over our social lives and build deeper, more fulfilling relationships both online and offline.",1,1736507067.0,MinimalScreenLife,0,1.0,False

What is attracting me is a grind by weight, and flat burrs to improve workflow and expand my coffee selection to lighter roasts. Leaning toward a Eureka Mignon Libra (55mm) or the AP (65mm). The only video review I can find on the AP isn't even in English as it's very new. The larger burrs and much larger adjustment dial are compelling.

1hy1p9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfChristmas/comments/1hy1p9l/last_second_thanks/,Last second thanks! ,"Hi guys, I know this is stupid last minute. I'm really sorry about that! It's been so hectic!! Luke has had a very long 2 weeks. Between 2 different hospitalizations for what look like either more new allergies or an autoimmune issue (specialist appt next week, thankfully), & a stomach bug from the ER, it's been really hard to find both the time & focus to do much of anything else. I really wanted to get some good pics of him playing with everything, but it took a while for him to be able to do that with everything going on. I really feel terrible for this delay! But I did end up getting some great pics with each gift (except for the books, I'm sorry, he won't focus on books with a phone out. Just know that he very much enjoyed each one & that's the first thing he noticed & looked through before he even realized there were presents lol). I just went in order of original comments on the request post. I also threw in a few pics of him getting his dad's guitar bc his face is just so sweet. & there's a whole bunch of just silliness bc he's wearing his cute jammies.


Here's the link to pics. I know I talk too much. I had to split it up into two.

We also made a fun challenge out of our traditional ""acts of kindness"" that we like to do all month. We didn't have any funds to work with, but yall inspired me to get creative to spread the love in honor of each of our Santa's. So I'll include what activity each of you guys inspired us to do. We had a lot of fun doing these & I'm so glad I didn't just resign myself to skip this year due to our budget! (Note: I didn't take pics of most of these bc I have ethical qualms with consent & most of them directly involved others.)




u/JMTC789  Luke just absolutely loves both the Elmo & the cow Blanket!!!! He crawls under that blanket every single day, head first & is so sweet! When he opened the Elmo, he immediately wanted to put it on, but he was sketched out by the microphone bc he thought it was food & i was trying to trick him (he really really doesn't trust food right now). But as of Monday, when I got the brilliant idea to pull up the selfie mode on his dad's phone & let him see himself with it, he got it like a light bulb & started singing & pushing the sound effect buttons. He also really likes turning ""Old Macdonald"" on full volume & letting it play over & over & over while running around the couch with his guitar yelling vaguely farm-animal-eque noises. For. Hours. It's really cute though, that song slaps, or whatever the kids are saying these days. I tried to get pictures of all that. Not sure if they're legible. He's faster than the camera, or my ability to realize that I'm taking a burst shot instead of a video. So. They're not top quality, but they are top cuteness. Thank you so much for Blessing us this holiday season! 

For your ""inspired act of kindness"", I took inspiration from your lovely story of your son who took his time to find his voice & then went on to save people's lives! & also from your gift of warmth to Luke. Our local FD/EMT Headquarters (real small town, it's the same building, & is walking distance from my house) does a community event every Christmas where they have Santa & everyone brings old clothes & toys & it's pretty much a giant Christmas swap meet while the kids are entertained by the Uniform Guys (they open up the bays & show the trucks/sirens & let the kids try on bunker gear). I'm in a real small & poor farm town so most people here don't have many resources for new stuff. This year I crocheted 20 pairs of kids mittens to give out, & then we brought fresh baked cookies to each shift on Christmas day (Luke loved that part, bc they have a park next door). I included a video of Luke with a pair of the mittens, & his picture with Santa from that event! 




u/School_House_Rock   you totally spoiled this kid. Seriously. You showered him with pupper pictures, presents, & love. We are so grateful for your generosity! The first thing he went to was the ducky book & he flipped through the whole thing before u think it even clicked that there were presents to open lol. He also loved doing the Mrs Rachael book (he got the singing doll while we were otw to the hotel during the hurricane bc it was a very tough time, & he ran & got her so excited when he saw the book). He's obsessed with her show; his favorite people are Jules bc they have a guitar & a puppy named River, & Erin bc she signs! He lovesss the Bouncy singing bug (alien?) & he carries it around by the ears(?) & loves the green ABC button the best. The fish bowl is super fun too, he likes to put all his tiny toys & crayons in it & hear the splash. He hums the clean up song (like from barney, I still sing it myself, even when he's not around ngl) & it's so sweet I love it so dang much! He loves the Moana doll & puts them in his stroller with Mrs Rachael. He likes having tea parties with Nana & so he always brings her toy food. When he saw that Moana came with bananas, he ran her right over to her house next door for a cuppa before he would even open anything else. He was very excited! He also loves his pooh bear jammies & wears them so much! I love that there's 2 pairs that we can mix & match, bc he's not a tidy dude & needs frequent costume changes. I tried very hard to include many pictures of them, but you may have to look at them all to actually piece together what they look like bc he doesn't sit still ever, even when sick lol. 

I already told you about your inspired kindness. We went to our assisted living village & had a Schoolhouse Rock marathon! It was very fun & Luke was captivated by the songs. He of course brought his guitar & got everyone singing & he was very tickled that everyone knew the songs on the tv. He also met a puppy there named Daisy the beagle who snorted at him a lot & would talk back to him when he barked at her; it was love at first snort. It was a lovely day of smiles & memories. Thank you so much for all you've done for so many people! 




u/unraveledflyer   Luke plays with this Dino so much AND TALKS!!! He's never so chatty verbally but he loves singing actual words to the Dino! He says ""eeeaaaatttttttt"" real drawn out like Mrs Rachael does & then ""nomnomnom"" in a tiny little growl & he hums the syllables of the colors while he signs them (which is something we practice in speech therapy) so it's really helping him make progress already! It really captures his focus, which I think is a big thing for him. He also knows how to turn it on music mode where the little keys are like piano notes & makes really pretty melodies! I didn't even know it did that! It's so neat seeing him be creative & expressive with music. This is such a great gift & we really appreciate you! It's really going to help him practice both his speech & oral feeding skills & that's just so so huge! 

For your inspired act of kindness, I saw that you're active in food subs & both me & my partner love cooking & serving others through food. During the first few days of hurricane, we got with a local family propane business to distribute hot meals to the community & to the line workers for the whole month. We collected everyone's freezer foods after the power went out & cooked & stored it using the business generators & then they were able to use their fleet to deliver every evening. So I decided to call them up to see if they'd sponsor a Christmas community meal. They were game, so we got with the local church food pantry who was able to host at their fellowship hall. Together, we made ham & rice, Mac n cheese, green beans, collards & blackeye peas, sweet potato souffle, & banana pudding for almost 150 people for Christmas eve! Our community is still struggling to pull ourselves up from the hurricane, so these kinds of events have become very important to us to help everyone build each other up & be there for one another. It was a really successful event that left a lot of hearts & bellies full in a time that can be pretty hard. Thank you so much for inspiring that!!! 




u/S1159P   Luke loves the ball dropper toy so much! He likes the car side & will drop them down & belt out ""GO"" at the top of his little lungs, it's so cute! That's one of the few words he actually likes saying out loud; he says it at every stop light in the car too lol. It took him a few days to get the hang of the bear lever, but once he got it he figured out how to let go at just the right time to send the ball flying off the first loop & then he cackles like the tiny agent of chaos that he is. It's the best & I love it. He has a lot of fun with this!!! Thank you so much!!!

For your inspired act of kindness, I saw your cow cover pic thing (moo!) & just ran with that. I love cows & I was so happy that moo was Luke's first word (used in context at least) & we actually live next door to cows & can sometimes hear them from our porch!! Anyway, there's actually a farm animal sanctuary nearby to us (I think they mostly have pigs) but they have this GIANT hereford bull there & I sometimes go out of my way to drive by & see him. I called them up & we volunteered there for the day & learned what farmers do. It's a hard job! They're primarily a pig rescue, bc in my area there's a bad problem of people getting them as babies & letting them go when they get big, which is a certain death sentence. They also take in other hard-to- place animals like cows. They're really great people who care so much about animals! They have 2 cows now. A smaller black one named Nicolas, & the giant (he's 6'4 from hoof to shoulder!!) black & white boy named Freckles. I loved them so much & were going back twice a month to volunteer!! I wouldn't have thought to do that without your inspiration! Here's a link to a video of Freckles & Nicolas but it really doesn't do justice to how big he is! Nicholas is not a small cow ordinarily, but he's dwarfed by Freckles! https://youtu.be/SDVPb2YKk20?si=c-2IsEugtA9m6XlC




u/Cmartin2304   thank you so much for all the books! We loved them! We opened a lot of them early. I was actually able to snag him a magnetic train from a swap meet, but didn't have a track, so I put it on top of the 3 train books & it worked perfectly bc he noticed the toy first & then once he noticed the books under it, we read those right away while he played with the train. He loves turning the pages, & watching the words we point to while we read. I think he's going to be a real book worm! All the farm books were a huge hit! He loves yelling farm noises. He likes doing realistic ones though, bc we live next to 2 farms & he knows the real noises. He thinks ""quack"" is just silly grown-up speak. He ""ack""s. & his horse whinney is honestly spot on! We also really enjoyed your letter! Luke had me read it aloud & point to the words. He wanted to make a sign name for Landyn bc we didn't know if he already had one. (Schoolhouse_rock got him on a sign name kick bc he didn't realize he could do that before lol) He liked the y in his name (it's his favorite letter) so we came up with the motion for ""land"" (palm down circle) with ""y"" fingers. I'm working on writing a letter back, but I'm very overwhelmed by life atm so please bear with me. I'm a thoughtful person, just not a very punctual one. 

For your inspired kindness (&one reason we opened some books early, so we could read them all first), we took about a quarter of the books you gave us & some toys we've grown out of (plus an unopened toy he got 2 of from his birthday party) & put a few in the Blessing box by the park we walk to every day for the week leading up to Christmas! It was really fun & something he really liked helping with! He got so excited to look in the box every evening when we go the second time & see if someone got the presents he left! A cool thing that actually happened was that I noticed after a few days, other people added different books too! Even some teen/young adult books! This is a blessing box I frequent every month (I always put our excess & allergy foods we get from the food pantry every month) & no one's ever put books in it. One evening, there was a kid I've seen at the park, adding a stack of books & a bookend he made. The bookend is still there! He nailed 2 pallet scraps together & painted a happy book with the word ""library"" on it. It still gets different books all the time. We have a lot of kids who walk to school & the park is right near the school, so I guess the kids around town kept it going. I thought that was really cool & I can't wait until he accumulates enough books again to donate them back! We really appreciate you & Landyn & your family! 




u/0hn035   thank you so much for the Lego Pok√©mon train! I was so excited for this one bc it was a train & a fun thing for Luke to do with his dad (who didn't get much except for silly crafted baubles in a stocking) so it was a great way for both of them to get a really cool gift! Luke's dad is such a great father & guy & he is really streets ahead of literally any dad I know (especially my own). He didn't know his own dad until he was an adult, so it is very important to him to be the best dad he can be. & he really excels. He's had 2 spinal fusions & permanent nerve damage that leaves him on ssi & he really beats himself up about it, but he's honestly made to be a full time dad & Luke adores every atom of that man. He's had a tough life, & he thinks he's made of stone, but that kid turns him into playdoh. I love seeing them do activities together bc it's literally magical the way they interact. I can't even describe it. & they already share so many interests! Watching them put this thing together was a hoot! Luke kept stealing pieces with a cheeky grin & when his dad would notice, he'd cackle & take off running. He kept hiding Pikachu's butt. Once he realized it was a train, he got really excited! I put his favorite train song on & he just couldn't take it, he just let out the cutest little high pitch ""chooooooooo"" like a little teapot. I laughed so hard a about peed. I didn't get any pics of them building it bc I was running interference, but I got a few clips of him playing with it! 

For your inspired act of kindness, we got with the owner of our local Lego play place that recently opened, & coordinated a free monthly swap event for anyone that lives in the town so that people who couldn't normally afford to come would get to gather & build & possibly swap if there's enough interest! I thought it was really cool of the owner to allow & our first event had a pretty good turn out! Thank you for helping inspire this enriching activity in our little community!!!!




u/supermarketsweeps25   you're like a Christmas ninja! You swept in at the last second to deliver extra Christmas joy, & that's just so rad. Luke loves his silly fox! He'd never seen anything like it, & when I showed him how it worked, he got so excited he just started bouncing! I hooked it up to the baby fence thing that protects the tv from Luke, right above his piano & he LOVES playing his piano & then reaching up & pulling the fox! He's got a whole little one-man-band going on. It's adorable. The pics are a bit blurry bc my child is a whole tornado who doesn't even sleep still. Just know, that is a sure sign he loves it lol

For your inspired act of kindness, I decided to channel your gift-ninja skills. My local Starbucks (where I used to work several years ago) is where I go to get some work done or have a moment of adult interaction. My mom's office buys them Coffee regularly & she does the coffee run every day so she accumulates a LOTTTT of their reward points & let's me use them (the absolute saint). They (starbucks) had their tip jar stolen recently & they never replaced it. I know how much those guys depend on tips, & they work on Christmas day, so not having a jar out would hurt them on a generous holiday. So I made them one out of a dollar store candy jar & modeling clay. I put extra strength magnets I found in my uncle's old barn so that it'd be really hard to take. & I put a chalkboard sign on it that says ""if we PERKED up your day, please ESPRESSO your gratitude"" (but that they can erase & write what they want, but hopefully in neater script). I came in & set it at the counter while the barista was making someone else's drink, & left without a word. It's been there every time I've been by & I heard a customer comment on it & the barista told them that Santa must have brought it. That was a super great feeling! Thanks for inspiring me to help others, & to get to feel like a Santa too :)

CW/TW: Implied/Referenced Character Death, Grief/Mourning, Implied/Referenced Death in Childbirth

Summary: 

Crowley is in desperate need of a new job, but it's not easy finding a job as a nanny when you're a man in your forties.

Enter the ridiculously attractive - and recently widowed - Professor Aziraphale Fell, who needs a nanny for his infant twins, Adam and Warlock.

Crowley is smitten instantly, but there's not a snowball's chance in Hell of anything happening, so he can just get on with his job.

Right?




Excerpt: 

The coffee shop had extremely uncomfortable chairs, and Crowley reminded himself to sit like a normal person, with both feet on the floor and without bouncing his knee or slouching or just generally taking anything like his usual cavalier approach to furniture.

Possibly, a giant cup of espresso was not the right thing to have ordered when he was already anxious.

This was what came of being early for things, he decided. Instead of the anxiety about being late, you got to just sit around with only your nerves for company instead. He made a mental note not to bother, in future.

He should do something, anything. Probably not look at his phone though, not if he wanted to make a good first impression, which he definitely did.

At least he‚Äôd picked a window seat; people watching might distract him for‚Äîhe looked at his watch for the eleventh time since he‚Äôd sat down‚Äîthe next six minutes.

The street outside was less busy than he was used to‚ÄîOxford being rather quieter than London, particularly with the majority of the students gone for the summer‚Äîbut there were still enough people that he could watch without staring at any one person for too long.

Although‚Ä¶sometimes there was somebody worth staring at.

1hy1ndi,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1hy1ndi/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

At the begging, I was still on flight / freeze. Now I‚Äôm in complete freeze. Absolutely suffering.","I've never felt so horrible in my life. This is the worst it's been. I don't have visual distortions, the world doesn't loom scary or feel dangerous anymore. There's just this complete discount from reality and myself. I don't feel fight or flight at ALL. Zero. No adrenaline - nothing. When I close my eyes I can't even feel my own body or breathing. I'm grinch to connect with old memories to remind myself I am still me, but I can't - they're completely inaccessible. Tonight I was at dinner and I felt like a ghost - like I could just walk through a wall, I'm completely unaware of the world around me and my own body.

I've tried so many things. I'm at a loss. I never could have imagined a year ago or 6 months ago that I would get worse, not better. There's some deeply rooted anxiety that I cannot feel or access anymore, that's making my body / mind not feel safe. At least when you feel anxious, you know what it is. When you feel fight or flight, you know what it is. I don't feel a thing and haven't in months. Can't even feel a hot shower, or smell something and have memories come up. It's like I'm brain dead.

I felt so much fear and feelings of unsafety before, like I had to run home or be within a safe distance of home. I feel none of that anymore, I don't even feel like I'm unsafe or needing to flee, I feel dead. Nothing. This has to be the collapse stage of a overwhelmed nervous system. But I've done everything to try to heal. I don't know what my body and mind feel unsafe about. Yes I've been through tons of trauma. None of it is happening right now. I've been on meds and in therapy for 2.5 years and only getting worse. It's so bad that I feel like I never had a life, I can't access any of my memories pre summer 2022 when this started. I barely even remember anything since then, either. Something is going on here - I need to have a scan done of my brain.

I am fatigued 24/7. I don't care about ANYTHING. Not dating, doing fun things, etc. I'm 32 years old and have no sex life or romantic life. I am so so so numb and exhausted. My head spins all day with the same thoughts about my state and how stuck I am, how hopeless I am. You would be too if this was your life. I have nothing to look forward to, enjoy, feel. Even a cup of coffee I can't enjoy or be present for. I am not present in my body or my life. My mind thinks it's protecting me but it's doing the opposite and killing me. I had a perfectly happy life up until September 2022. I was happy, I loved life, I had so much energy, I meditated every morning and felt great. I was in such a good place. And then panic attacks, agoraphobia and DPDR ruined my life. I've never been the same since, and instead of getting better, I am getting worse. I'm at a complete loss of what to do. Complete. I can't verbalize my experience and have anyone understand. All that's in my head all day is looping thoughts, songs and inwardness. There's no inner world in me anymore, and no outer world either.

How do you explain to someone you have no self anymore, you don't remember your entire life, you don't have sensory input from the world, you feel like you're dying from fatigue, and you have no emotions or connection to anyone or anything? There are no words, I can't live like this. I keep getting worse and worse and worse. Just when I think I can't get worse and I've hit rock bottom, there's more. This is a level of dissociation I didn't know someone could even experience. I feel like I don't exist, like I have no recollection of my past, of my future, I am no longer me. I am no longer anybody. Reality and the world aren't the place I knew my entire life. I think I'm in a nightmare I cannot wake up from. I've lost my entire life, purpose and freedom. There's no point to anything like this, emotional connection with others and the world is so important. Being able to cry, scream, feel, love, feel content and familiar in your body, those are all things I no longer have. I'm a hologram now - not even a human.

Okay let me tell you about the most awkward (and only) date I have ever been on.
So this happened 10 years ago, before I got together with my now fianc√©. I had just moved to a new city to start university, and into an apartment with three guys I‚Äôd never met before. (A lill‚Äô tip to you: don‚Äôt do this because you think it could be ‚Äújust like in New Girl‚Äù - it won‚Äôt be.)
Anyways, two of the guys wanted to make me a profile on a dating app because they didn‚Äôt get any matches on their own profiles. But they said girls always get more matches..

I have never really dated much, and just thought yeah whatever I don‚Äôt have to meet up with anyone if I don‚Äôt want to.  So they made me a profile and started matching with people and started talking to them. After a little while I started to feel uncomfortable and took my phone back. But I looked through the matches and started talking to some of them because they seemed like they could be fun to talk to. But I didn‚Äôt really have a plan to actually meet up with anybody. Like I said, I had just moved to a new city and had started university, and really didn‚Äôt have a wish to get together with anyone.

But one of the matches was fun to talk to, so we chatted back and forth, about hobbies and whatever, and at one point I had mentioned that I worked as a dj at a student bar sometimes. We chatted for maybe two weeks, but I didn‚Äôt really have an urge to meet up with the guy. But he showed up at the bar one night I was working, and came up to me to talk. I was super awkward, and a bit busy, so I probably seemed a bit standoffish. And the next day I felt bad, and he wanted to meet up for a coffee, so I agreed. 

This guy was not my type, I didn‚Äôt find him attractive, but he seemed nice and sweet, so a cup of coffee wouldn‚Äôt hurt. So we met up, drank the coffee and I was ready to leave after half an hour or so. He said he didn‚Äôt have a rush to be anywhere so offered to walk me halfway home. I said sure. When we hit the halfway mark, he said he really needed to use a bathroom and ‚Äúall the public bathrooms cost money‚Ä¶‚Äù (he said while staring at me)‚Ä¶ so I reluctantly offered him to use the one in my apartment.  I regretted it at once, because holy cannoli the awkwardness. It was a 30min walk.

I have to mention that I live in a country with low crime rates and I didn‚Äôt feel unsafe ‚Äì I just really wanted to go home alone and not hang out with this guy anymore.

We arrived at the apartment, I pointed him to the bathroom and went in to the kitchen where I awkwardly waited for him to leave while pretending to be busy studying. After a few minutes he came into the kitchen and all of a sudden he was like really close to my face staring into my eyes‚Ä¶.. I took a step back (and backed into the kitchen counter) and probably made a weird face, and he said (while still being VERY COLSE to my face) : ‚ÄúI just wanted to see if you wore contacts‚Ä¶ I saw contacts by the sink in the bathroom.‚Äù‚Ä¶..

I said ‚Äúnope not mine okay byyyyyeee‚Äù and (as politely as I could) pushed him out the door, locked it, went into my room and locked that door too. Deleted the app. And swore to myself that I would not be meeting up with anyone from dating apps again.

I saw him one other time, a couple of months later, at a student party at Halloween. He was dressed in a superman-onesie-pyjama-thing. I was there with my best friend and my now fianc√© (who I met at university NOT a dating app). And onesie-Superman stared at me awkwardly for quite a while but I was too drunk to be polite and say hello, and too drunk to care ‚Äì and I haven‚Äôt seen him since!",2,1736504428.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False
