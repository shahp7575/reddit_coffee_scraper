1gx2xb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1gx2xb0/built_an_ai_provisional_patent_generator_being/,🚀 Built an AI provisional patent generator being tested by Silicon Valley attorneys,"Hey builders! After getting quoted $800+ for a basic provisional patent, we built a free AI tool that helps founders get that crucial ""Patent Pending"" status for just the USPTO fee ($70):

**Link:** [**https://patent-pro.vercel.app**](https://patent-pro.vercel.app)

**What it is:**

* Free AI-powered provisional patent generator (full patent generator being tested by a prominent SV firm 🤫)
* Takes your idea → USPTO-ready provisional application in minutes
* Perfect for that initial 12-month protection while you build
* Bank-level security - your IP stays private

**Try it risk-free:**

* Test it with a ridiculous invention first (seriously, make up something fun)
* See how it formats your provisional patent
* DM me or u/classic-spring2398 about the full patent generator we can't talk about publicly yet 🤫

**Why builders love it:**

* Quick 12-month ""Patent Pending"" status
* Built with a stealth Silicon Valley patent firm
* Same tech they're testing internally
* Way cheaper than traditional route ($70 USPTO fee vs $2k+ lawyer fees)
* All data encrypted and secure

**Example:**

Try *""AI-powered coffee mug that judges your drink choices""* or any test idea. You'll get:

* Professional provisional patent draft
* USPTO-ready format
* DM if you want to see what else we've built 👀

**Secret menu items (DM only):**

* Full patent generator access
* Intro to our stealth law firm partner
* Special r/sideproject rates

P.S. Yes, we filed our own patents for this 😉

I have a history class (college) with her and she has been in my group a few times, I think she is cute and want to ask her to hang out. Of course there is a strong possibility that she has a BF right now since she is really cute. Last class it was just me and her in a group and it was awesome! She is so smart and knows a lot about history! 

I had the chance to ask her on Tuesday night but she walked too fast after class and I could not keep up (I have a bad leg and I limp). Sure I could have shouted her name and walked as fast as I could but no avail. Only two more class periods left too. I am terrified and TBH I have a feeling she might say no (my luck with dating is not stellar). I just want to know how I should word it? And should it be diner or coffee first?

1gx2wad,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1gx2wad/i_dont_feel_like_going_on_this_trip_anymore/,I don't feel like going on this trip anymore,"I am currently dating this guy for over 6 months. Recently, he invited me on a trip out of town to which I obliged since his birthday is already coming up and he has been very vocal about spending time together. Since he is terrible at planning and coordinating (e.g. he fails to secure the reservation because he fails to pay or confirm so we ended up not booking the place) I helped booked the place. I did the researching, inquiring with the hotels/resorts, etc. I finally found a place at a nice, private beach resort which is luckily available on the dates we've wanted. So I showed it to him to make him pick the room from the options presented. He chose the room for our 3D/2N stay and so I confirmed the chosen room with the hotel.

Now, the hotel demands full payment to confirm reservation. I let him know that. They have also given us a deadline to settle, otherwise they'll release the dates from booking. It is taking him quite a lot of time to transfer payment, and I was worried we might lose the place again if we don't get to settle soon and I don't wanna ruin his birthday getaway -- so I offered to pay for the whole reservation fee (close to Php20K), just to secure the place. he agreed and said that he'll just transfer the money once he gets the time within the day. 

He did transfer, which I discovered, just a portion of the total cost. Then in a phone call, he asked me: ""We're splitting the costs, or will I be paying for everything?"" (not verbatim but to that effect). I was surprised and caught off-guard. I didn't know how to answer. He then proceeds to tell me that there are a lot of other expenses when we go on that trip like food, gas, toll, etc. I eventually was able to answer and told him that no, I didn't know that we're splitting. He never told me. Because otherwise I would have said no or recommended an activity that he or we are both willing to spend a considerable amount of money for. He then said that it's okay, etc.. he'll pay for it but will take him a bit of time to pay me back for the balance. This made me feel terrible because it seems like he can not actually afford this trip, even if he is insisting he can cover for it. And somehow it makes me feel like it's appearing like I am taking advantage of him.  

Take note that throughout the planning, he never mentioned about splitting the costs or any concerns about the costs or paying. Hence, I assumed that he'll be taking care of everything. Makes sense because it's his birthday and I thought this is how we wanted to celebrate it. In fact, initial plan was just to go on a 2D/1N trip but since he wanted to spend more time with me, he proposed to  just make it 3D/2N. Again, I agreed. I even filed for 2 days leave from work. 

Also note that I actually have no issue about splitting the bill or in instances when the guy picks up the tab after the date, I pay for something else, like coffee or dessert. But these are somehow planned on my part. I make sure I allot enough funds for such. Also because I don't want guys I date to feel that they'd always have to pay. Although if they offer, I oblige. 

But in this instance, I was not ready for it. Although, for this trip, I have already intended to pay for the gas and toll fees because we're bringing my car. I also plan on getting him a bottle of his favorite liquor as a gift, since it's his special day. These in themselves are already costing me a big chunk off my budget as these are unplanned expenses for me, and and I am not willing to spend more than I intend to since I am also saving up for another big trip. I just feel so uncomfortable that he suddenly dropped that on me.

I do not feel like going anymore because I do not like this feeling.  Hotel is non-refundable so canceling it is not an option. But I really am not willing to spend more than I have allotted for this. Heck, I didn't even spend this much for my own birthday! Had I known he expects me to spend a lot, I would have just said no to his invitation. A part of me just wants to split the cost of the room, but a part of me also feels that it's unfair because I didn't even ask for this trip! I just agreed to make him happy on his birthday! Aaarggh.. just wanna get all this stress off my chest.",2,1732262572.0,OffMyChestPH,2,1.0,False

I go to a dermatologist and she has prescribed me panoxyl face wash and clindamycin gel for almost 3 years and it doesn't help at all :( 

I eat products containing dairy maybe once a month if that (I do eat pizza quite often though like maybe 3 times a month). I drink soda/juice/coffee/anything that's not water maybe once or twice a month. I also eat candy/chocolate maybe once a month. 

The things I consume very often that idk if they have an effect are iced chai lattes (with oat milk),rice, sushi, beans, pizza, and chicken. 

I walk about 10-15k steps a day so I'm pretty active (I know exercise can sometimes have an effect on acne). I sleep about 5-8 hours during the week and about 8-12 on the weekend (I also know this can have an effect). I drink about 2-4 times a month (I also know this can have an effect but I notice that when I do drink the next morning my skin looks better?). I also vape sometimes.

1gx2v6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwarhammer/comments/1gx2v6c/the_legend_of_jimmy_hoffa_the_rat/,The legend of Jimmy Hoffa the rat,"Karag Orrud, Devil's Backbone, turn 100-something. I'm playing Ikit Claw heading south after eating all of Bretonnia and working out a tenuous we-don't-need-to-call-this-a-thing relationship with Vlad the Chad. The Bloody Handz were a problem for a while but Ikit solved that the same way he solved every other situation (ratling guns) so it was all gucci. Skarsnik was too busy beefing with evil dwarves in the east to give a shit about what was going on so that left me and Thorek Ironbrow tusslin' over some dusty ass mountains. 

I have 6 armies scattered in various grouplets headed by such illustrious rat generals as Bill, Dumb Thotticus, Coach McGuirk, Rich Evans, and Esmerelda (name suggestions had to be sourced from a groupchat due to an overwhelming number of Sciensurges and Morphages). It's getting a little hectic. Thorek and his bitches are running circles around my warlock masters and generally doing their best to stop one ancient, nasty rat from fulfilling his dreams of exploding the moon, presumably out of jealousy.

The dwarves' haterism reaches a point where they're able to corner two armies in a distinctly unfavorable position. Seasoned warlock master Dumb Thotticus and up-and-coming grey seer Bak-Bak of Black Chasm are caught between Thorek and some other equally unpleasant dwarf-thing. It's a bloodbath. Rats being blown up left and right, dwarves being shot into rat-size chunks, clanrats hoping no one notices them skittering off for a vape break in the middle of an artillery barrage, the works. There are Doom-Flayers chasing ghostly-ass granddad dwarfs in between globadiers really putting their backs into some friendly fire. Eventually both sides are whittled down to two units each- Thorek and his skanky ass supporting hero for them, and one unit of ratling gunners and one chieftain hero for us- all other rats having either died or taken a look at the situation and decided to be somewhere else, including our army leader.

Our remaining chieftain's name is Jimmy Hoffa. He's a leftover from confederating with my wife Queek about twenty turns ago and he's level 29. A real beefsteak of a rat. He's down to about a quarter of his health and the ratling gunners are made out of coffee stirrers and gum so they're taking a beating. Jimmy Hoffa is only barely able to take out the other dwarf hero before the gunners run out of ammo and start trying to smack Thorek's giant head with their sad, empty little rat guns. Obviously they die immediately but not before somehow managing to get Thorek down to about 800 hit points (with some previous assistance from a now-atomized unit of very persistent rat ogres). 

Jimmy Hoffa the chieftain turns around. It's him and Thorek now. The whole battle rests on his ratty little shoulders. Jimmy is mounted on a bonebreaker and has a really startling array of equipped items and abilities that are all off cooldown and able to give him a substantial boost to armor pierce, speed, charge bonus, everything he needs to cycle charge this stupid tiny bitch into oblivion, if he can survive long enough to do that. Thorek is somehow not at the healing cap and regrowing limbs at a very concerning rate. Jimmy is, of course, also a rat, and is having some second thoughts about this whole business. But with a quick prayer to the Giant Rat That Makes All Of The Rules our boy Jimmy is able to crash his trusty steed into Thorek so many times that the dwarf falls off his idiot surfboard and dies of shame. Jimmy has somehow survived with a mere sliver of his health and secured the victory for his warlord Dumb Thotticus, who immediately takes all of the credit in typical ratkin fashion and levels up twice. 

Thanks to Jimmy's heroism Ikit is able to sweep the rest of the region and snort his warpstone in peace. A statue of Jimmy is presumably erected in Skavenblight for a few hours before it's consumed for food.",4,1732262449.0,totalwarhammer,0,1.0,False
1gx2uws,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1gx2uws/bday_outing_goes_as_expected_until_it_takes_an/,"B-Day Outing Goes as Expected, until it takes an inconsiderate, romantic turn; so we ruined his reputation online. (Juicy Plot)","**For Context, I (14M) am a Sophomore in High School along with several others. Basically, I have 4 friends whom I’ve known for most of my entire life. We’ve seen each others’ highs and lows, ups and downs and 2 of them are my closest friends. For the sake of the two people’s privacy, I’ll name them Friend 1 and Friend 2.

**Last weekend, we decided to go out to celebrate the birthdays of another two. Yes, both share the same name and birth date. All four of us are in a big friend group of 8 and all of us went out together.**

**Basically, what happened is that we all went to a mall in a very lavish district, far away from home. It was evening when we all gathered together and decided to treat the birthday boys with some sushi. When the food arrived, I had to admit I absolutely loved the food and the service, so when we left, we left a very generous tip - especially after the server rushed to give one of our friends his left-behind jacket. We thanked him and we left the outdoor dining area.**

Keep in Mind, We finished our meal two hours before the movie started, so we got tickets to see the movies. The movie was basically weird aliens fighting each other in a random desert. 

Shortly after, we went to Cold Stone for ice cream. I was running low on money, so I borrowed some from a friend to get ice cream and later some popcorn. I put myself on a tight budget and didn’t get any extra money, spending a big chunk of it on getting sushi. That’s what I call poor planning.

So Here’s the turning point: It was half an hour before the movie started, and my stomach started to ache very bad because I ate all that food, so I rushed to the bathroom and took an explosive shit in there.**

**While I was gone, my friends went to a barista and ordered some Ice Coffees. But by coincidence, a special girl that we know happened to pass by and it just so happened to be when I’m all alone taking a shit in a stinky ass bathroom. You might think: What does that have to do with anything?

For background, A couple of months back, we were all hanging out, and Friend 2 developed a random crush on an asian girl who came from a whole different continent and his obsession with her caused a lot of tension within our friend group. We tried to stop him, but he kept causing problems. He even went as far to insult one of the now-birthday boy’s family, because he apparently “stole his girl”, and that he didn’t get to mingle with his crush.

So when that girl passed by, just minutes away from the movie, she saw Friend 2 and immediately ran away in awkwardness. Friend 2, being the desperate little guy he was, chased her around the mall, completely missing the movie, embarrassing himself in front of both the girl and the friend group who entirely left him behind and went to see the movie with me. We all enjoyed making jokes in the middle of it and laughing at other people’s awkward moments.

**After it ended around midnight, we looked everywhere for him. The mall was almost entirely closed and dark, as if we were in the backrooms. Eventually, we found him, but he didn’t really care that he missed the birthdays of his closest friends, which kinda made them livid and upset after they had left him during a heated argument.**

Considering he was a long-time friend, it was hard to watch him do that chickenshit.

Anyway, after we got home, we saw that he kept leaving girly comments on her IG saying “cutiee 😍”. So, we got our friends back to tell him in public that there are other fish in the sea. Then another girl went to quarrel with him, so the crush destroyed hus reputation and told him that nobody could replace the random girl who commented and her. After that, one of my distant friends invited her to his house and are about to be bf-gf. The video was soon taken down after. Savage.


Sidenote: Tbh, the big issue here was that he neglected the birthday boys. That really struck us hard. So yeah, that’s about it. Wasted dollars, Wasted ticket.

1gx2uwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonfanfiction/comments/1gx2uwr/across_the_pokémon_world_whats_your_creative_fuel/,Across the Pokémon World: What's Your Creative Fuel?,"Hello, fellow trainers and writers!

It’s been a while—how are you all doing?

This past year has been anything but gentle, but writing my Pokémon fanfic has been a lifeline. We’ve discussed a lot of great topics here before, and today I’ve got another question for you all.

**Writing—whether it’s fanfiction, a novel, a screenplay, or an e-book—takes time and emotional energy.** Your ideas and characters stare back at you during the process, and sometimes it’s hard to keep pushing forward. So I’m curious: **How do you help yourself through it?**

For me, it’s all about music, coffee, water, and pictures of my family.

Music has always been my pillar. Growing up, I transitioned from old-school rock to punk and then to metal, which has stuck with me ever since. When I need to deep-dive into lore or write something particularly complex, I put on video game soundtracks. There’s something about their atmospheric vibes that helps me focus and immerse myself in whatever challenges my characters are facing.

As for drinks, it’s coffee and water—always. Funny story: back in high school, I was fascinated by conditioning (think Pavlov’s dogs) during a psychology class. I decided to try it on myself by associating soda with something unpleasant. Every time I sipped soda, I pinched myself. Hard. Guess what? It worked! Now, I stick to my coffee/water combo—and I avoid cookies while writing because sticky fingers and keyboards don’t mix (no, I’m not using chopsticks for snacks!).

Finally, I keep a picture of my family nearby. Life hasn’t been easy—like facing a Dark Mewtwo armed with Shadow Balls—but my family is my safe haven. They give me strength to push through anything, and I’m grateful for them every single day.

So, what about you? How do you submerge yourself in your stories? What keeps you grounded when the going gets tough?

On a related note, my next fanfic chapter is lined up for release on November 26th, and after that, I’ll have shared everything I’ve written so far. [If you’re into adventures featuring a Ranger in Johto, feel free to check it out!](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/95157/pokemon-ranger-the-viral-catalyst-a-pokemon-story/)

1gx2rll,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gx2rll,I carried a 35kg price of log for no reason ,"
So, it’s finals week—my last set of exams in high school, and I’m in a boarding school where everything is already kind of insane. Last night, running on exam stress, nine cups of coffee, and no sleep, I made the dumbest decision ever.

There’s this construction site in the school grounds (they’re expanding the place), and my friend joked about this massive log lying around. He said it’s probably from one of those old pine trees they cut down and went, “Wouldn’t it be hilarious if you carried it to the dorm?” And, of course, my over-caffeinated brain went, “Sure, why not.”

So, I actually did it. Dragged this 35kg piece of wood (not super tall, just up to my knees, but still ridiculously heavy) from the bottom of the school grounds all the way to the top floor of the dorm. Alone. And for what? It took me a few minutes after catching my breath to ask myself, “What the actual hell am I doing?”

Now the log is just sitting in my dorm, and here’s the kicker—I’ll be leaving for home soon after finals, so I can’t even take it with me. I have no idea what to do with it. Maybe I’ll leave it here as a parting gift to the school or something. Or just let it stay as a random monument to my terrible decision-making skills during high-stress situations.

We hung out probably the first four nights after we matched and in all our interactions together it just felt natural and refreshing. We slowed it down a bit and started seeing each other about twice a week. Everything felt like it was flowing in a great direction. She was warm and welcoming like I hadn’t ever experienced before, I the same, and we both initiated plans with each other.

Come Halloween, she invites me to a party at her house with all her friends and I’m happy to accept her invitation. It was a weird night but acceptable, most of her friends were great. She was distant and confusing but I wrote it off as her being overwhelmed hosting a party. As the night came to an end I could sense some distance and tension but didn’t know what to make of it. 

We go to bed together and end up talking late into the night. She brings up how she’s not emotionally available as she just got out of a year-long relationship just four months ago, and still needs space to find herself. She also mentions that she doesn’t want to be exclusive and wants to have the ability to meet new people. She also admits to me that one of her friends at the party was childhood best friends with her ex-boyfriend of four months ago and that inviting me there feels like a step too far in this “thing” we have going. This threw me off completely. 

I thought about it for a few days after and she eventually initiated coming over to mine later in the week. We talked again and she said she goes back and forth about what we are and if we could work, she tells me she’s still confused and dealing with her past feelings but that she likes me a lot and wants me in her life. She tells me how she wants to include me in more things in her life. At this point I’ve decided to play it cool and not put any pressure on her, as I’m still trying to form my opinion on her and if I’d want to even date her, although I’m ultimately looking for a relationship with the right person. This was about 2 weeks ago.

I came to learn that her ex is visiting the city we live in to visit their mutual friend (the one mentioned above) and she says it feels like her progress on getting over him is backtracking. Although she acknowledged how empty he made her feel and how refreshing it is to have me in her life that can be a beacon of hope and support. I contemplated ending things with her over the next few days after because it felt like a lost cause to stick around, especially not knowing the dynamic with her ex and out of fear of them rekindling and leaving me in the dust. Eventually, I decided that shes not worth giving up on so fast and continued to play it cool. 

She continues to initiate plans, her exes' visit came and went without a rekindling and she even told me over coffee the other day she hates that he’s even here. I’ve still decided to take the approach of stepping back to let her go at her own pace. She’s incredibly distant over text in between our meets/ dates but we continue to see each other about twice a week; with her initiating just about every time we do. When we’re together we have fun and get along so naturally it’s almost scary. She’s sweet and funny and kind and it confuses my heart.

I feel stunted in my “thing” with her because I don’t know where we stand or where we’re going. On one hand she’s this incredibly warm girl with so much care in her heart, on the other she’s established everything mentioned above. I don’t feel like I can offer any more of myself to her right now, I feel like doing so would just push her away or get myself hurt. Like I’m bumping into a brick wall she put up regarding our progress. It does feel more positive now like it could work and I’ve recently come to terms with my feelings towards her, I’d like to try us out. Still, I’m ultimately waiting for her to say she wants more because my doing so would likely come off as pushing for something she already put a stop to. Still, she hasn’t brought up “us” since and I’m not sure if it’s worth waiting around a bit longer or not.

1gx2fut,https://www.reddit.com/r/reunionwillcome/comments/1gx2fut/a_reunion_of_ghosts_in_room_406/,A Reunion of Ghosts in Room 406,"So, there I was, scrolling through Reddit late one night, doing the usual aimless browsing that usually ends in a recipe I’ll never cook or a conspiracy theory about ancient aliens. But this time, something on my feed actually made me sit up. It was a post from a sub I’d never visited before, and the title was straight out of a strange memory, saying, “Looking for old friends from Room 406. You know who you are!”

For a second, I couldn’t move. Room 406 wasn’t just a place; it was the room that practically defined my university years. We were this weirdly mismatched group thrown together by chance, yet somehow, we’d fit. Four of us were completely different people with equally different life plans, and yet, for a couple of golden years, we were closer than family. We laughed until we cried, argued over the dumbest things, and spent far too many nights surviving on pizza and dodgy coffee while we philosophised about the universe and our place in it.

But then, like so many things, time happened. Graduation pulled us in different directions, new jobs, relationships, cities, and before we knew it, we drifted apart. I’d barely heard from any of them in years. But there it was…someone from our past was reaching out, and not just someone. The post was signed off with a name that made me smile in an instant, ‘Baldwin’s Ghost.’

You see, “Baldwin’s Ghost” was our code name for Professor Baldwin, one of those old-school lecturers who’d randomly drift through the halls during our all-nighters, dropping in to “encourage” us with pep talks that left us more confused than inspired. Baldwin didn’t even know we’d given him the nickname, but it stuck. And whoever posted that message knew it, meaning it was definitely one of the original 406 crew.

I hesitated only a moment before I clicked on the post and typed a quick reply, “Room 406 legends never die.”

Then, the replies started rolling in. Familiar usernames, references only the four of us would know, things that made me grin at my phone screen like an idiot at two in the morning. The thread was alive with the energy we used to share, and it was surreal, as if we’d opened up some time portal back to those hazy late-night conversations.

As the conversation picked up, we naturally drifted into reminiscing about the things we thought we’d forgotten. Someone mentioned the ridiculous “code of honour” we’d come up with to survive our uni days together-essentially a pledge to never abandon anyone during a library all-nighter or back down from a philosophical debate, no matter how absurd. We’d even joked about turning it into a “manifesto” to leave behind for future residents of Room 406.

Then one of them, Sam, randomly brought up our school uniforms. It sounds silly, but it hit a nostalgic nerve. We used to complain about those uniforms all the time-who wouldn’t? They were uncomfortable, stiff, and, at one point, our school even insisted on a forest green blazer that had us all looking like trees. Back then, the only thing worse than putting on those uniforms was spending all day in them.

Sam said he’d recently driven past our old school and spotted a kid wearing that same green blazer. He laughed, saying it was a miracle they hadn’t changed it. That’s when someone pointed out that our school had been using the same supplier, Uniform Manufacturer, for years. We’d never cared much about that detail back then, but looking back, it almost felt endearing, like this stubborn little piece of our past had refused to change, no matter how much we had. The uniforms, like so much of that time, had become part of our shared memories.

Then, in the middle of this unexpected trip down memory lane, a message popped up from Sam: “Hey, what if we did a reunion? Just the four of us. It’s been years, and maybe we owe it to Room 406 to get together one more time.”

There was a pause. I think we were all holding our breath, wondering if anyone would back out or say it wasn’t possible. But one by one, we agreed. We’d make it happen. Somehow, it just felt right.

A month later, we were all gathered in a small café near our old campus. Walking into that café was surreal. They all looked the same, yet somehow more grown-up, like they’d each been through a million little changes that only I could see because we’d known each other so well back then. The energy, though, was as easy as it had always been. We ordered coffee and spent hours catching up, laughing like no time had passed at all. It was like opening a door and finding Room 406 still there, waiting for us.

At one point, we even talked about the old uniforms again-how we’d secretly personalise them back then, rolling up the sleeves or pinning little patches on the inside so we’d each feel a bit more “us” amidst the conformity. Sam told us he’d met someone who worked for Uniform Manufacturer recently, and we laughed about it. Back then, “Uniform Manufacturer” was just the tag inside our clothes, but now it felt like this little anchor that had kept us connected to that version of ourselves.

By the time the café staff politely nudged us towards the exit, we’d relived years’ worth of memories and made plans for more reunions in the future. As we hugged goodbye, it hit me that we’d each left a bit of ourselves back in Room 406, a version of us frozen in time. And somehow, this unexpected message had brought us back to reclaim it, if only for a little while.

The strangest part? When I got home, I went looking for an old photo of us together, and there we were—standing in front of Room 406, arms around each other, wearing those iconic green blazers. It was the last picture we ever took as a group before graduation.

Sometimes, I think we leave parts of ourselves in the most unexpected places. And maybe, if we’re lucky, we get a chance to go back and remember who we were, even if just for a night.",1,1732260541.0,reunionwillcome,0,1.0,False

\----

Small business owner here.  we have been with Bell for at least 8 years.  they gave us a HH2000 when we opened the account.  I'm pretty sure my problem is because its too old (2014?)

We have Bell ""Total Connect"" with 2 phone line with high speed Internet for businesses.  when we moved to this location 2-3 years ago, they added 2 mesh pods for the network. we have 4000 sqft.

we have now about +/-12 people working here with cellphone and/or smartwatch and probably 30 computers/printers/Chromecasts/Interac Machine/Ipad and other thing.  May be even the coffee machine is online. we have more that 40-50 device plugged sometime event 60 i'm sure...

The phone keeps NOT ringing when customers call here.  And sometime we cant even hear people and lose the sound.  we have to recall them.  Last year, i was tired of that, so i called them a lot of fix it.  they ""gave"" us an upgrade by giving us higher bandwidth.  we now have 950Mbit/s in DL/UP. its fast enough.  thanks.  But sometime it still lags or the phoneline is weak and i remember one of the technician telling me that we had ""a lot of devices"" plugged in.  but they also told us that they couldnt change our HH2000 because of our 2 phone lines with ""total connect""...

**I was wondering it that was true. that HH3000/4000 don't support 2 lines?**

one of the tech did even suggested that we get a full other internet connection... wow... are we there? we have like +/-12 employees in a retail store!",1,1732259896.0,bell,0,1.0,False

She was a nice helpful girl and we were good friends for a year. Lost touch post university except for 1-2 odd run-ins with common family/friends here and there. My mum too had met her at a restaurant I guess with her husband and kids. 

Cut to 20 years later, when I heard my name called out in the middle of a busy mall. Took me a second  but I was so happy once I recognised it was M. We immediately sat down over coffee and talked for an hour. I found out she had left her unfaithful husband and given him full custody of both her kids and no alimony. She was no contact with her kids out of her own choice. 
She was barely scraping by (doing aura readings, tarot, etc) and also supposedly in a relationship with a guy who’s very well off but wanted to be anonymous within her friend circle. 

She bombarded me with calls and texts after our meeting and wanted to talk. I guess she was just lonely. And I wanted to talk to her too. 

But the stark differences in our circumstances held me back. My living husband and I are expecting our first child, live in a very nice home with our dog and are doing very well financially too. I tried downplaying most of the details of our lives when she asked because I didn’t want her to feel bad about her situation. 

But something was niggling me at the back of our mind. She kept talking about luck, energy etc. and then she asked me something. The day I met her, afterwards I went towards the car park. She asked me later if I generally travel alone or with a driver. Odd thing to ask but I didnt think much about it and said generally a driver is there but that day I was the one driving. So she quietly remarked oh so sometimes you’re out alone. 

It wasn’t much but it felt like she was trying to ascertain something. Felt almost fearful of that exchange. I haven’t seen her in 20 yrs so don’t really know what she’s into now. 

After that I kind of ghosted her and haven’t had any contact with her since a few months ago. I feel guilty I ghosted her at a time when maybe she needs a friend but I also want to protect the good energy of my household. Specially knowing she’s not in a good place herself. 

So AITAH for ghosting her?

I have a crush on my coworker. I'm 24, I think she is 22. When she texts me she always tries to be funny. Always finds a way to crack a joke. She is shy in nature. She doesn't really talk to anyone in the office like me.
I assumed she is into me too as I before we started talking in person she always tried to glance at me when I'm not looking. I asked her for coffee in the office once, she said she's busy but definitely next time. The next time around, this time in WhatsApp, I couldn't control myself and asked her for a coffee. She said she doesn't do coffee or tea but will keep me company. I took it as a rejection. She asked if that's fine. I said what do you mean. She said ""you don't sound happy"". Next day I started ignoring her and she tried to talk to me. I was rude with one line reply and not the usual fun and playful replies. Post that, I pinged her cracked a joke as I felt bad and ever since we started talking normally and cracking jokes again. Long story short, we started talking normally after that. I even helped late at night when she was busy with work, we talked for 1 hr 30 mins. Post that normal texting. Few days back I again called her just to talk to her again we talked about random stuff and for 1 hour. That was really beautiful. Yesterday I called her. She picked up, and said she's busy and will call back after sometime. After sometime I got a text from her saying she was sorry and she was on another call. Then I said no need to be sorry. She again apologized and said she was sorry. She was really sorry for the way she picked up the call and said she was busy and hung up the call.

That was day before yesterday night. This morning I replied that it's all good. Just felt like talking to you that's why I called. PS: you're too sweet, please don't say sorry. (Referring to her apologies)

Now since then she did not even reply to my message. I'm on leave. She's working today.

What does this mean? Does she like me? Do shy girls take time to respond when someone compliments them.

Also yesterday when we ran into each other in the office, after some small talk she was like ""how are you this tall"". I thought she was flirting.

Did I mess it up 😭😭😭 

Can anyone tell me what to do now.

PS: this is the first time I have approached my crush.

i have a classmate, she's a ballet teacher, really good in academic, and she just looks so perfect. she's the least person i expected to be friends with. but yesterday we unexpectedly hang out together along with our other classmates including my boyfriend. i felt so awkward and shy around her, feel like she's out of my league. but at the same time it was so fulfilling and ego boosting to be friends with someone like her. while we were in the coffee shop watching a movie, my bsf messaged me saying if she can join us. i was like ""ofc you can, just go over here"" while i was waiting for her i can already imagine what my other friends will think because my bsf usually look like a mess, but not in a bad way and our humor is not suited for rich people, i am trying to fit in and not being myself so i can make myself look like her. i feel so bad for having this thought because i love my bsf and i'm not ashame of her, i don't wanna be. nonetheless, the hang out went well.

today, me and my bsf hang out. she said ""what's the name of that ballerina classmate of yours?"" with an intention to hook up. i said her name and she stalked her. but i don't know why i feel this way that i feel like i don't want to introduce my classmate to my bsf. i really don't want to feel this way, but i feel like something inside me does. my bsf is a lesbian and prolly has a crush on her. i feel like they're not a good match. maybe i think about this because of their life status or maybe i just want to be friends with my classmate without her being friends with my bsf. i don't know why i feel this way. i am so insecure and thinks that being friends with a girl who's out of my league makes me relevant. my relationship ocd is making it even worse trying to make me think that i'm inlove with this classmate, i am totally not, i am not a cheater and i don't like what's happening inside me. i don't wanna feel this way about my bsf because we've been friends for almost 7 years. i'll choose her over my classmate. 

it feels like i'm in a movie where a girl tries to fit in and wants to be friends with someone higher than her so she could brag about it. i just wanna be myself. how do i fix this? should i stop trying to be friends with my classmate? she gives off mean girls vibe, but she's so different from that. as far as what i've observed. am i a bad person? i just want to make my teenage life memorable, but i think it's getting toxic.

1gx2323,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assassinscreedmirage/comments/1gx2323/slow_loading_fixed_by_reinstall/,Slow loading fixed by reinstall,"Played this game twice (on PC, using Ubisoft Connect), no performance problems at all. Started a new run and I seemed to be having some of the cutscene problems that so many people reported when it first came out. Some key scenes were either completely black or froze a few seconds in, although the sound was audible and uninterrupted. I've never uninstalled the game and never changed the in-game settings, so I started laboriously working through first Windows settings, then NVidia control panel settings and finally in-game settings. Nothing worked. Eventually I realised that I didn't have a cutscene problem, I had a loading problem. The map was taking time to load, loading saved games was leaving Basim running around a grey desert for ridiculously long periods of time and the cutscenes would start/resume eventually if I waited long enough. The benchmark wouldn't start for nearly a minute, but then proceed normally (with a few jitters).

So at this point I finally uninstalled and reinstalled, something I didn't think would be necessary for a game that had been left untouched for months. Boom, problems gone. No, the problem wasn't corrupted files, I had alrady checked that.

How this game manages to tie itself in knots on PC mystifies me, but if you see the same problem, just try the reinstall and go hve some coffee.",1,1732259012.0,Assassinscreedmirage,0,1.0,False

,"so my (18f) and my boyfriend (20m) have been on and off for about a year. we met in high school and he had just broken off a long term relationship before i started to develop strong feelings for him. i ""got him"" (switched with a friend) in secret santa and got him a heartfelt gift involving something we'd bonded over both enjoying, and i wrote him a pretty short letter. it was mainly a ""hang in there, you're awesome!"" letter, because he was a grade older than me and struggling with his mental health pretty badly. we kind of had a ""will-they-won't-they"" thing for the rest of the year, in which i was madly in love with him and he did his best to kind of humor me and keep me at arm's length. i'm not saying he didn't care about me, but certainly not in the romantic way i'd expressed. we had sort of a blowup phone call because i felt he'd been leading me on when he had no intention of following through, and he basically told me ""i can see myself with you in the future, but i'm going through enough right now and i can't handle it"". i thought ok, fair enough, but then heard through the grapevine about him trying to get with his girl best friend. i was absolutely livid, and kind of blew up on him for lying to me. long story short, we made up by the end of the year and i wrote him yet ANOTHER letter, confessing that i was in love with him. we tried out a ""relationship"" over the summer, but he never gave it a label and said that he wasn't quite ready for using labels yet. i was put out, but i just wanted to be with him so i forced myself to understand. he took my virginity that summer, he told me that he loved me, the whole gf-bf thing but with no label. by the start of my senior year i was kind of tired of it, so i broke things off hoping he'd stop me and realize that he cared about our relationship, or something. not my smartest idea, i know. he didn't stop me! but he did reach out that december and we kind of ""got back together"", breaking it off pretty quickly after that. he'd had a fling with a girl in between that, which like ok whatever. we had a series of on and off moments, until that april when my mom passed away from pancreatic cancer. i reached out to him, he came to the memorial service, and we pretty much picked up where we left off. i was essentially his girlfriend, and it took a while before he put the label on it but eventually he did. he would always give me little ""breakup scares"", basically losing his mind over this or that and convincing himself that he didn't want a relationship with me. i would basically just sit there and comfort him, not saying much, until he'd convince himself again that he did want this. it was exhausting, but i was used to it. this happened maybe three or four times before we actually broke up for the last time. i was leaving my hometown to live with my family in a more rural area of our state, about two and a half hours away. i lived with my single mom and my dad is out of the picture, so that was more sensible than paying for that apartment and having a revolving door of people in and out to stay with me until i went to college in the fall. i had just left, and we'd made plans for him to visit me there for a couple of weeks. we were on a fantastic track, and suddenly it just started to feel... off. he wasn't really responding to my calls or texts, and then he had this mushroom trip that he still says ""changed his life and his pattern of thinking"". we broke up shortly after, he was just being so cold and distant and not acting like he cared about me at all. i was absolutely heartbroken and i will be honest, made some pretty targeted tiktoks that never said his name but were pretty clearly about everything he put me through. fast forward to this september, i had pretty much gotten over him. i had just turned 18 and was on all of the dating apps, not really having any luck. one night he called me from no caller id, and i instinctively knew it was him. i left the dorm bc my roommate was sleeping, and picked it up. we got coffee the next day (which turned into a whole day together and then having sex in my dorm when my roommate was at a football game), and we were officially kind of back together. i went to a party that night and got super drunk and spilled about the whole thing. my friends were all like what the FUCK because we'd agreed that he was a pos and i should never get back with him. i've never expressed this to him, but i had some MAJOR doubts. i didn't want to put myself in a position to get hurt again, but he seemed so different in a good way. he was sober, he was telling me he still loved me and missed me (which he'd never done in our previous reconciliations) and he was genuinely talking and acting like he just wanted me back in his life, and to get it right this time. it's been two months exactly since that day, and overall things have been pretty amazing and i love him more than i thought possible. but lately, he's been kind of spiraling into his old behaviors again. he recently had a big interview that he was nervous about, and he decided that i was a big distraction and we couldn't hang out or talk often until it was over. it was for a big boy job, which he said he really wanted to support me with so we can start our lives together, and that i'm the person he wants to come home to every day. that's all fine and dandy, but then he kind of got mad at me for not talking to him and generally acted super pissy. he does this thing where he makes up reasons to be mad at me for hours, sometimes days, and even (admittedly) occasionally gets mad at me for no reason at all. he just does and says things to push my buttons, entirely on purpose. and then he gets mad at me if i retaliate, and then he finds another reason to get mad at me if i don't. he pretty much always apologizes for the events after they've happened, but he still doesn't stop doing it after a few days. tonight, he called me on the way home from work. he said how crazy he thought it was that i ""got him"" in the way that i did, and essentially he feels like i ""tricked him into loving me"". he says that he likes the way things are now, and he wouldn't change it, but the way he worded that really put me off. he later said that he didn't want me to be like his ex girlfriend, wishing people unhappiness just for finding happiness elsewhere. this really made me think that he was about to break up with me. he was hinting at me knowing he doesn't want to hurt me and being too scared to say what he really thinks, but when i asked him if he did want to break up he said ""no, i mean just generally being too scared to hurt you to say what i think"". i feel like he feels trapped by me, but i've made such a concentrated effort to make him feel comfortable and loved that i don't know what i could possibly do. we stayed on the phone after that convo for a couple of hours, which he spent basically the whole time picking ""joke fights"", and trying to get a reaction out of me. i didn't like it, i said that he didn't like it, but i kept playing along in hopes that we could move past it and end the call on a better note. he says that he genuinely loves me and reassured me that he doesn't want to break up with me, but i honestly don't know if that's true at this point. as i mentioned, today is our two month anniversary, and when i mentioned it in a happy and excited way he got pissed off that it was important to me, and just generally shit on it. he kept saying that the little milestones are cringe, it's the ""real stuff"" (marriage, house, kids, jobs, real lives together) that is worth celebrating. this hurt my feelings, because i view our lives together right NOW as a ""real thing"". he's a person who's very anxious about having enough money, and a supported and stable life is really important to him. i can't tell if this is his way of trying to push my buttons so i leave him and he doesn't have to feel the guilt of having broken up with me, or if he's just going through a rough and anxious patch and i should wait it out, or if i should even try to talk to him about my feelings. it seems like whenever i bring up my feelings, or even suggest that he's doing something wrong, he gets super defensive and turns it around on me. it feels like there's just no winning. i would love some insight from an objective perspective for some advice on what to do, or even just a confirmation that he does or doesn't want to break up with me.

To start, my fiancé and I had a recent conversation about working on being more mindful with one another. Actually dating and pursuing each other, basically trying to work on get out of this roommate stage. Yesterday morning he woke up early, around 4am, to go hunting (one of his favorite hobbies) while I slept in at home. When on his way home he stopped to pick up coffee. He got himself a Frappuccino and a vanilla sweet cream cold brew for me. Here’s the thing… I don’t like vanilla and I don’t  drink milk. I work in coffee, love coffee and want to open my own shop one day. I drink a cup of black coffee every morning. If I’m going out and trust the shop I’ll get an oat milk Gibraltar, oat milk cappuccino, or a black iced americano. If I’m feeling sweet and was something fast I’ll get a cold brew with a chocolate cold foam. 

We have been together for 3 years, go get coffee at least once every 2 weeks. Along with I talk about what I drink at work often. I can’t  help but feel hurt that he doesn’t know what I enjoy. Let alone can drink! I know he was trying to think of me when picking up the coffees. But it just didn’t hit the mark.

We are all home from college now and every weekend I try and make plans with my girl friends but plans are always set already and I have never been included bc of my ex (we are on very good terms and have hung out as a group before) although I have reached out about hanging out on multiple occasions. I don’t even care about actually going to the bars to hang out, just anything even if it’s just a trip to get coffee. It’s almost impossible to make plans with them and I am constantly upset bc I feel as if I have just been pushed to the side even tho I had such a big part in even bringing that group together. I can never just get them to hangout without the guys, and I usually host a holiday party every year for everyone to get together but I feel like there’s no point to do it this year and I almost wld feel embarrassed and desperate if I even asked to do it. It really sucks because I am in rly no position as to where I could even go out and make new friends. ",1,1732257555.0,u_Playful-Ad6748,0,1.0,False

My partner and I made a lil club where we meet up as a group at a different cafe around the inner west one Sunday of every month.

If you love coffee, like a nice brunch or just fancy meeting a few new faces, come down to Matinee in Marrickville at 9:30 on Sunday!

Would be great to see you there x

Floor scales and good coffee scales have shown >1.5kg. I don't write the exact weight, because it's very hard to place it right on a small surface. But both have shown >1.5kg pack only. 

It was a huuuuuuuuge downside, since I would not buy this pack, if I knew the weight right away. To me it was my RE Alpha 31 replacement, that has an internal organisation I want.

The harness is so comfortable I haven't noticed right away. But for some reason TAD Axiom S2 in Ultra felt lighter. Put on the scales and both RE Alpha and TAD S2 in Ultra are 1.2kg, while MW Mars is over 1.5kg, as I've said earlier.
