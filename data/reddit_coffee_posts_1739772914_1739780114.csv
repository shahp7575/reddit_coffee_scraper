Felt like something clicked in my head and I flipped it upside-down and realised the lip edge on the lip never even touches the cup so its cleaner to place it that way

And yes I drank with the lid off that day. The pastry crust is nice but not in my coffee

1irexxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1irexxx/ive_realized_something_and_i_think_you_need_to_do/,I've realized something and I think you need to do the same as well,"I have had tons of successful manifestations. Yet I was still spiraling with my SP. Why did I do that to myself? So let me start with a success story that happened yesterday.

I've neglected to buy a coffee table for my living room for a while now, and a few days before this weekend I thought about going in the city nearby and buying one on sunday. I saw myself picking the one that looks good with my other furniture, I felt the sunday atmosphere of the city. I did visualize having one in some of my scenes before, so I thought I should have one at this point. BUT, the important thing, I didn't do any techniques, strictly speaking. I didn't even look at this as conscious manifesting, I thought the scenario, I knew I had it, and literally didn't care about it after that.

On sunday my father called me to accompany him to a nearby city buying some hangers, as he didn't want to go alone. Sure I said. I told him which shop to go to for a hanger, but he didn't listen to me and we went into a furniture store (the same one I visualized myself buying one). I thought I wanted to buy a table anyway so I asked a worker if they had one available, but the one I choose was not in storage. Instead she showed me a more expensive one, the very same I visualized and offered me a discount so I can get it the same price as the one I originally wanted. On checkout when I was about to pay, my father payed for it instead. So I even got it for free. Tell me if this is not a perfect bridge of incidents.

Now this is a weird one, because I had every single step and detail visualized, which is generally meddling in the middle, not a good idea, but since I had zero resistance about it, it was fine.

The next realization came when I thought back how I manifested my hostile boss to become my friend years ago. I didn't know Neville back then, I did use an occult method for it, but in reality I just changed my assumption about him, the technique did not matter at all.

 So creation is finished. Neville is totally right about that too, and this proves it for me. When I started my current job, I was pretty troubled, expected the worse from everyone, I walked into my workplace I already visualized arguments and fights, and they actualized. Funny thing is, he sometimes mentioned that if we were not colleagues we'd probably be friends. Instead we were shouting with eachother every other day. On one weekend I set a simple intention with a sigil, ""good boss"" and dropped the inner hostility (again, magick is bs, it's not the point). From then on, I assumed he is good to me. A bridge of incidents occured in the next few weeks where we had to work together overtime and went into a pub after, and actually became friends, and formed our own ""click"" from then on, I pretty much do whatever the hell I want at work from that point on, like writing this post right now. And we are actually friends, drinking together on weekends and all that. He was my friend to begin with, but he was forced to play out my unlovely assumptions.

So why am I telling you all this, and why the hell did I have trouble with my SP? I was really desperate about her, it's her or no one kind of mentality. I manifested something, thought great, I can do the same with her, then went back feeling the lack of her. I was pretty much stuck in a loop of convincing:validation found (got a click from Neville or reddit, manifested something)-doubt-repeat.

I couldn't detach from 3D SP, so even when I thought I was applying the law, I wasn't. I manifested the opposite of what I wanted, eventhough just like the first version of my boss, she did everything in her power to bridge the gaps between us until she was forced to play out my unlovely assumptions. It was all my fault, I had to realize she didn't do anything wrong against me. Imagination is the only reality, so I thought, are we together in the only reality? And if I am brutally honest no, I lived in the end of trying to manifest her, I thought from not being together.

Why? Because I had doubts about the law. I tried to hammer in faith, to brainwash myself with reading and listening to Neville endlessly, but I was never in the end with her. I thought in the back of my mind that ""I need a plan B, what if this isn't real?"" ""What if Neville was a conman"" etc.

People say that you have to be delusional to use the law properly, but after all I have experienced, it is much more irrational to doubt the law than to believe in it. This is literally the only view this world makes any sense at all.

So is the law real? Yes, no questions about it. So why the hell I'm not actually using it with my SP? The only thing I need to do is stop living in the end of us not being together, and live in the end of us being together. The only success story/technique you need is Neville's Barbados story. Seriously.

I really want to talk about how I unwittingly manifested endless signs, to drive that point in as well, but the bottomline is don't seek validation from the 3D. The 4D is what really matters. And my father got his hangers from the store I originally told him to go to if you are interested lol.

# Artificial Stone Benchtops: The Modern Choice for Kitchens

When it comes to designing your kitchen, artificial stone benchtops are the go-to choice for many homeowners. They combine the beauty of natural stone with the practicality of engineered materials, making them both visually stunning and incredibly functional.

Artificial stone benchtops are made from a combination of stone aggregates and resins, which results in a surface that is durable, non-porous, and easy to clean. This makes them an ideal choice for high-traffic areas like kitchens and bathrooms. At Granite Marble Stone Australia, we offer a variety of artificial stone options, including quartz and other composite materials, that can suit any style.

The benefits of artificial stone benchtops are numerous. One of the most significant advantages is their ability to resist stains, scratches, and heat. Whether you're chopping vegetables, pouring hot coffee, or cleaning up a spill, artificial stone benchtops can withstand it all. Additionally, the wide variety of colors and patterns available means that you'll be able to find the perfect match for your kitchen design.

Another advantage of artificial stone benchtops is their low maintenance. Unlike natural stone, which requires periodic sealing to maintain its appearance, artificial stone is incredibly easy to clean and doesn‚Äôt need sealing. This makes it an ideal choice for homeowners looking for beauty without the hassle.

1ires5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ires5b/trying_to_get_out_of_a_friendship/,Trying to get out of a friendship,"I‚Äôve had this friend since high school (we‚Äôre 35 years old now) and over the years I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve outgrown the friendship due to many reasons, one of them being differences in personality, she‚Äôs blunt, oftentimes rude and competitive. She and her husband were also friends with my ex and there were some conversations that were had about me behind my back that I had found out about, coincidentally from her (she admittedly told me that she told my ex, f@&$ [insert my first name], and that she didn‚Äôt want to talk about me anymore) why I stood in contact with her after that I admit is my own set of issues. However, when I met my husband I was obviously on cloud nine and well she wasn‚Äôt. She proceeded to tell me that I moved too fast and was unsure about my decision. She proceeded to talk about me behind my back this time coming from other people so that‚Äôs when I decided to cut her off. I got married to my husband and she ended up reaching out to me months later to amend the friendship and I felt bad so I got back in touch with her and we stated hanging out and talking again. We then had a few double dates with our spouses which was kind of awkward given that her husband was still good friends with my ex so I tried to keep that to a minimum to not make my husband feel awkward. Fast forward about a year later we both end up buying property out in the same city and start hanging out more often. Birthday parties, hikes, lunches, you name it. Seemed like all was going good until her + her husband started having marital problems and I was there to support her. Then she started comparing, literally everything. My past situation with her current one, our husband‚Äôs, our careers, how we parented our kids, etc. She decided to stay and work things out with her husband but during that time I felt like her normal competitive behavior intensified. She‚Äôs always been that way and I think I‚Äôd be able to brush it off but it got to the point where she would send me screen shots of what her husband would say about what I was wearing, what I had, and ask her if she wanted those things because I had them? The weird thing is that she would send me these things? Like why would she do that? I remember my husband and I were so excited to buy a treadmill and she admittedly told me that her husband told her she just wanted one because I had one and her response was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been wanting a treadmill but she got it first.‚Äù The more and more I was around her I started feeling physically uncomfortable. And the more and more I tried to keep my distance, I feel like she has tried to hold on or push to keep the friendship going. My question is why is that? Why wouldn‚Äôt she just let it fizzle out? It got to the point where she started walking up to my car at school pick up to talk to me. Last weird example that I think was really the last straw for me was that my husband and I have had our Breville espresso machine for a few years now. She‚Äôs always made comments about how she wished she could drink coffee but never could handle the caffeine but as of late her and her husband have been going on coffee dates and most recently she bought and espresso machine too. She had been telling me that I needed to make her a coffee and one day she posted her espresso machine on her IG and I was like oh wow that‚Äôs awesome and she responded with ‚Äúmy mom got it for me for my birthday.‚Äù It was so strange and even though it sounds dumb that really was the last straw because it honestly feels like she wants everything I have. Sorry for the long rant but I need advice on how to get out of this friendship gracefully without making it a big deal it‚Äôs just too weird now. ",1,1739778900.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

For example, imagine doing a¬†cheating roleplay¬†with characters from¬†Khabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. The slutty Pooh (Kareena Kapoor) constantly pushing her limits, always small satin robes or sheer robes and nothing else, the ends of the robe stopping at her mid-thigh, the loosely tied belt the only thing protecting her from flashing. Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

or how about a in-universe sequel to Humraaz?

Following the steps of other successful choreographers before him (Farah Khan, Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Acharya, etc) - now Omi has plans to turn into a director and take the responsibility for an entire film.

Raj Singhania (41) has occasionally financed a few films done by his friends. So he is known in the producers-directors circle. One of Omi‚Äôs acquaintances helps in setting up a meeting between Omi and Raj. The men meet.

Omi tells Raj, that he wants to make a movie about a married woman, without her knowledge. The woman will be someone who has a dancing background, but has been away from the dancing world for years. Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It‚Äôs shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj‚Äôs wife. It‚Äôs a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya‚Äôs girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother‚Äôs old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film‚Ä¶

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years. He saw how Omi‚Äôs hands had brushed against the naked skin of Priya‚Äôs back and waist. How her giant melons had crushed on Omi‚Äôs chest a couple of times. He wanted more‚Ä¶

# 3. Handwritten Letters or ‚ÄúOpen When‚Äù Letters

* Write your mom a heartfelt letter expressing your love, gratitude, and admiration for everything she‚Äôs done for you.

It‚Äôs a creative and sentimental gift that shows the connection between you and your mom.

# 11. Memory Jar

# 13. DIY Tea or Coffee Blends

*Read More:*¬†[*How Can You Identify the Best Creative for Your Amazon Ads?*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-can-you-identify-the-best-creative-for-your-amazon-ads/)

# Common Pitfalls of Designing Ads Without a Chosen Product

¬†

It may sound like a good strategy to create ads before choosing a product, but actually, it leads only to more time and money spent, unnecessary work, and incorrect campaigns. It fails to capture the essence of the ad goal, that is the ability to map the product ad to its features, audience, and demand.¬†

¬†

# Misaligned Target Audience

¬†

When designing an ad with no specific product in mind, then one is more likely to market the wrong demographic. This basically means that without knowing who the product is targeted, the ads could be a total turn off to some potential customers.

* For example, an¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller develops an advert for a ‚Äòuniversal kitchen tool,‚Äô but then goes for a premium, professional cutting knife. Cautious is taken not to appeal directly to the person most likely to be purchasing the food ‚Äì professional chefs ‚Äì but rather the folks who are doing the actual cooking.

To avoid this, select your product first, and then narrow down your audience. Take advantage of the audience and try to create a message which informs, interests and captivates viewers, readers and listeners.¬†

* For instance, you may want to emphasise on sharpness and robustness of the knife as a preparing kitchen tool for professional cooks. Knowledge about the audience makes the ad to convey appropriate messages to target customers and increases the chances of conversions.

¬†

# Inconsistent Messaging

¬†

When using this kind of ad format, lack of a product means that the message being passed can be generalized, or it does not make any sense at all. This impacts potential customers confusing the brands, eventually diminishing click-through rates.¬†

Think about an ad that says ‚ÄúTransform your kitchen experience‚Äù and the result is a product that is a bottle opener. A gap is created resulting in the disinterest and dissatisfaction of the buyers.

If you have a product that you wish to advertise and promote, then choosing the product in advance means that your message is much more likely to focus on what exactly you are selling.

¬†In this case, ensure that the bottle opener fits well in hand or that it will not be ruined after everybody has used it. Targeted advertising personalities the consumer‚Äôs journey from the advertisement to the product page, increasing customer confidence.

¬†

# Overpromising Features

¬†

Ads created prematurely contain elements that are misleading since they advertise certain features the product lacks. These lead to dissatisfaction among customers, and in the worst case scenarios; the business gets a pull-down by customer reviews.

* For instance, a skincare brand has a product with a tagline ‚Äòget rid of wrinkles now‚Äô then release another one ‚Äòthat can minimize fine lines after some time‚Äô.

To this end, one should ensure the ad‚Äôs assertions are based on the reality of the product in question. Do not use headline-making claims; use realistic slogans such as ‚Äúnoticeable improvement in four weeks.‚Äù

¬†On the bright side, the ethos established through the proper disclosure shows that honesty in advertising strengthens connection with customers for the long term.

¬†

# Misused Budget

¬†

Creating an ad too early has its disadvantage because the brand is creating a general advertisement campaign, not a product specific one.¬†

* For example, an¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller spends $500 on the ads for ‚Äògreat gadgets‚Äô only to fixate on a smart home gadget. Several of the ads get clicked from users who are not interested in the business gadgets, but some other related gadgets instead.

It means choosing your product first is more effective because it lets you build the budget more effectively. Make use of a relatively small campaign ad for the product in experimentation before expanding to a massive one.

¬†This is handy as it eradicates repeat advertisement by only featuring the advertisements that investors are willing to fund hence reducing wastage of your advertising budget.

¬†

# Lack of Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)

¬†

Generic advertisements that are not coupled with a preferred product often do not have clear call to action messages that can compel the potential customer into the next line of action. An ad that appears like, ‚ÄòShop the best in home improvement‚Äô, but makes no effort to guide the user to a product of that nature is not beneficial.

Once you are done with choosing your product, come up with a specific call to action statement, for example ‚ÄòShop the most durable power drill today.‚Äô This call to action is clear, concise and specific to assist customers into getting to the end goal to improve conversions.

¬†

# Ineffective Keyword Targeting

¬†

This not only makes it difficult for the sales team to know which keywords to use when advertising the product, thus the sale of the product is affected. An ad set for the keywords such as ‚Äúgadget‚Äù or ‚Äúkitchen tool‚Äù that advertises a very specific sous vide machine brings the wrong audience.

The second step is to do keyword research after you have chosen your product. Concenter the keywords on special terms that are closely related to your product and its target audience. Known as a post-click strategy, this enhances the visibility of the ad to the right customers and boost click through rates.

¬†

# Poor Visual Content

¬†

Creatives that are made for ad-only solutions are often rather vague and do not illustrate the product for its strengths.¬†

* For instance, a generic ad displays a picture of a kitchen as common as on other home-related sites but, at the bottom of the webpage, contains a link to a more specialized and expensive stand mixer. In this case, buyers do not view features of the product when making their purchase unless they decide to stop and watch the ads on an advertisement break.

Leverage¬†**listing images**¬†or videos with high quality of your product that shows how the product is used. It is necessary to draw attention to it and gain trust highlighting its distinct characteristics. The message that relates to features that make up the said product captures the attention of prospective customers better.

¬†

# Poor Conversion Rates

¬†

It‚Äôs not possible to compare with competitors and place your ad in order that will be seen as the best one without a product. An ad promoting ‚Äúhigh-tech fitness gear‚Äù does not pull out the stops and tell consumers how its product is superior to other similar products.

Stakeholder analysis should be conducted after you have chosen your product. Emphasize on the advantages of the product including degree of the product which indicates it is stronger or has more features than other products.¬†

The concept of positioning enables one to place a product on a pedestal and also draw customers towards it.

¬†

# Poor Conversion Rates

¬†

Non-technical advertisements do not get increased click through rates as people don‚Äôt get what they were looking for.¬†

Make sure that the ad has the same attribute as the one appealing to the products. Include specific examples of your product or service in your ad; for instance use ‚ÄúDiaper bag that has compartments for heating of baby‚Äôs feed‚Äù. When the advertisement is directly linked to the specific product the chances of conversion are heightened.

¬†

# Wasted Time and Resources

¬†

At the beginning, ad design consumes time and money, which can be used to focus on the product research and development. An innovation team invests lots of time designing an ad campaign for a product that never existed only to realize it is not needed in the market.

Always spend a lot of time in the selection of the products and the market they should be placed in before concentrating on the ads to be produced.

¬†It‚Äôs a good idea to have the green highlighted to ensure demand; you can use surveys or an A/B test for the green highlight. This approach makes your efforts productive, and guarantees that your ads are efficient and productive.

¬†

# What Happens to ROI When Ads Are Misaligned?

¬†

Misaligned ads can dramatically harm your return on investment (ROI), leading to wasted budget, reduced brand credibility, and diminished campaign effectiveness.¬†

When advertising strategies fail to align with the target audience or product offering, the consequences ripple across your marketing efforts, weakening performance and potentially causing long-term damage. Let‚Äôs explore how misaligned ads affect ROI and how you can correct these misalignments.

¬†

# Poor Audience Targeting Wastes Ad Spend

¬†

Mismatched sequences also lead to low correct customer reach, arguably one of the leading pitfalls that may cost a lot of your ad budget. Running your ads in front of the wrong set of eyes that are not in the market for what you are offering results in a high cost per click CPC with little or no conversions.¬†

* For instance, using interest-agnostic premium car brand advertisements on demographics without considering the purchasing behavior, the luxury car manufacturer can get a high CTR but very low conversion. This means that your advertising dollars are spent on driving click-intents that do not result in sales; a total loss.

The real purpose behind it is that most of the advertising mediums, like Google Ads and Facebook Ads, work on an algorithm model to analyze the right time to deliver the ads to the consumer. These platforms depend on algorithms that figure out who should get the impression of the ad.¬†

If your target audience is too large or not relevant enough, the system could display your advertisements to people who could not be interested in your product at all.¬†

While getting many clicks on your site, lack of outcome involving the visitors to become customers in business will make the overall return on investment poor.

¬†

# Low Conversion Rates

¬†

It becomes very disappointing when your ads get to the right audience but end up getting low conversions or a low ROI. Conversion rates are the number of visitors who complete the intended action within the session, often become clients, subscribe to a service, or fill in a contact form.

¬†When there is a very high value for CTR but a comparably very low value for conversion, that suggests that maybe the ad that you are putting out is not what the targeted folks wanted to see or actually needed to see.

* For instance, an organisation which sells luxury skincare may create an advert for luxury items but direct clients to a landing page that sells inexpensive skin care products. This creates a dubious gap between the ad and the landing page, which may frustrate a target customer leading to them leaving the page without buying a product.¬†

This allows you to avoid low conversion rates and make sure that the message of the ad and the page you lead people to are connected. The information set in the ad and the call-to-action must align with the experience of the client when s/he follows the ad link.

¬†If you have two different ad designs, two different landing pages or two sets of new call to action buttons, you can use A/B testing on which combination produces the highest conversion rates.

¬†When you continue using the same messages, calls to action, and designs, you limit the possibilities of discovering what appeals to your audience the most.

¬†

# Damage to Brand Reputation

¬†

Misaligned ads not only reduce the ROI in the current climate but also pose a danger to a brand. Where your ad attempts to create the expectation of something that is not met or even where the product advertised contradicts what your ad portrays it to be then you could easily get into the bad books of the public.¬†

* For example, if an e-commerce platform places an advertisement highlighting ‚Äúnext-day delivery‚Äù while the brand only provides standard delivery, it is highly possible that customers will feel deceived. It is unwise to have such discrepancies because they may reduce the trust customers have in your brand and the information they are fed with both from existing and potential consumers.

Brand image is undoubtedly one of the most important corporate treasures. Lack of customer satisfaction from interaction with an organisation and its products or services due to such factors as misleading or misaligned advertisements results in increased churn rate, decreased customer loyalty and negative word of mouth.¬†

Offering good customer service and after selling experiences are as crucial, to stabilize and strengthen brand image. That is the reason why it is important to respond as soon as possible, for example, in case some problems occur and it will help to avoid damaging relations between the customers of your brand.

¬†

# ¬†Inefficient Budget Allocation

¬†

Inappropriate ad placements also mean the allocation of resources is not as effective as it should be because the magazine must spend money to place these ads, and poor placement means low returns on investment.¬†

Thus, if your advertising overall does not attract the correct audience or if the promotions are not properly worded, you will find that you spend more money on useless campaigns.¬†

* For instance, you targeted to allocate a large share of your budget towards high cost, which pertains to keywords or even premium ad spaces that are not likely to convert customers. Therefore, you may end up running out of cash to fund the better channels or keywords that generate the right sales.

Without proper coordination between the ad and the target group, there arises a problem of maximizing your investments in advertising. Lack of proper budget utilization implies that the money is wasted on areas that do not possess high ROI, and sometimes successful campaigns, keywords are not prioritized.¬†

* For instance, if you are running a campaign for a local restaurant and use global targeting or too extensive keywords, then you will be experiencing very large costs with fewer relevant local conversions. Likewise, serving ads which don‚Äôt appeal to the customer segment of interest can end up with directing a lot of money towards the ads with low conversion rate.

¬†

# Higher Bounce Rates

¬†

Having mismatched ads cause a high bounce rate to occur when a user clicks an ad hoping for one thing and instead S/he finds something completely different. For instance, a beauty brand that advertises luxury skincare products and directs users to the landing page with affordable skincare products will get a lot of bounce traffic.¬†

Since there‚Äôs no alignment of the ad copy with the information that is found on the landing page, visitors become confused as well as disappointed hence abandoning the page.

Bounce rates are essential to the performance of the ads since it provides the comparison of the quality of the landing page to the expectation created by the ad.¬†

A high bounce rate can indicate that your ad is not relevant to the page you are leading users to, or the overall user experience is not good, which in any case will decrease the conversion rate.

¬†

To avoid high bounce rates, what you promote through ads and what you offer on the pages, should be harmonized in terms of the message and the design. The content on the landing page should present the benefit statement introduced in the ad as soon as the consumer clicks through to the page.¬†

* For instance, if your ad asks users to order before a particular date, the landing page should guide them on how to order and, at once, notice the expiration date.

¬†

# Mismeasure of Actual Performance

¬†

Each type of advertisement can become misleading in terms of measuring the results and defining the actual performance of your promotions.

* For example, assume that you already have a very high CTR, but the conversion rate is low, then it means that the ad is attracting the wrong kind of clicks or the message that it sends out about the product is wrong.

¬†Many times, optimizing for the sole goal of CTR can make marketers feel like everything is going well while, in fact, the targeting is off, the messages are irrelevant, or the ad doesn‚Äôt match the landing page.

¬†

# Lost Competitive Edge

¬†

As observed in competitive market situations, misaligned ads are capable of making the brand fade with its competitors. Your ads may bog down on ill-advised promotions, while your competitors with perfectly-aligned ads will be siphoning away market share more effectively.

¬†If you have not communicated this clearly, if your message is off, or if you are not getting across to your target market why your product is the better solution, then you are on a road to stagnation.

The chances of giving up an impression to competitors are critical in complex and changing digital landscapes, and continue to affect your business in the long run.¬†

* For instance, if you are campaigning on a luxury product but failing to inform the right group of consumers or are not advertising the most suitable benefits, then your rivals with a more effectively placed advert will get the consumers you are targeting.

¬†

# Increased Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC).

¬†

It is very standard practice to end up with an increased cost of acquiring new customers (CAC) when ads are misaligned to each other. The problem with ads is that they may not reach the right audience or maybe they offer the wrong message which makes you pay for clicks that are not customers.¬†

Therefore, the cost of acquiring a customer rises as it impacts the ROI in a big way. When your ads are wrong in terms of targeting and choice, or they do not meet the needs of the audience, this leads to a high CAC which affects the brand‚Äôs fund and profit margin, particularly in the fields with thin margins.

¬†

There are also possibilities to tilt the targeting approach and aim at less numerous but more suitable segments, which will also contribute to decreasing CAC. Based on analysis of the customer data and market research, develop profiles of audiences most likely to engage with offers and convert, or buyer personas.

¬†This is how you optimize your targeting criteria in order to reach out to the users who actually have a potential to make a purchase and make your CACs and ROI less painful.

¬†

# Decreased Lifetime Customer Value (LCV)

¬†

Offsetting ads can also lead to a reduction in customer lifetime value ‚Äì the amount of money a customer spends throughout the customers‚Äô and brand‚Äôs association.¬†

If such ads capture the wrong audience, which are people who do not intend to buy your product, each they bring to you will not buy again, hence lowering the overall earnings. Lack of brand congruence with the actual needs and wants of the customers can create ads that turn off customers for the product after the first time purchase rather than cultivating long term consumer loyalty.

To enhance LCV, increase its concentration on customer acquisition and making customers loyal especially on the segmentation that it gives value. Utilize the information on the target within its demographic spending, buying habits, and challenges.¬†

Design your ads in a way that the clients feel that you are addressing them directly, and show them the benefits of using the product in future. Individualize, as well as, capitalize on points that can get a hold of their worries and stress on aspects that promote its usage repeatedly or to frequently attend to its jurisdictions.

¬†

# Missed Revenue Opportunities

¬†

In its simplest form, misaligned ad mere is that profitable revenue sources may be lost. When your ads are poorly targeted or give wrong information or hardly grab the attention of the potential consumers, would-be customers will not get to see the offer, or may simply refuse to purchase.

¬†This leads to lost sales and hence low return on investment or ROI. For instance, an advert which claims to contain one aspect and when clicked, it takes the consumer to another product page lacking that aspect will push people away, thus missing business opportunities.

In general, everyone loves a good success story, which is why you need to ensure that all your objectives in your campaign; the audiences you are targeting and the ads you create as well as the landing pages, are all properly aligned with the utility of your product.¬†

Strong copy points, effective visuals, and exclusive and irresistible call-to-action that speaks to customers‚Äô and viewers‚Äô emotions. Emphasize on your uniqueness and show the usefulness of your product as directly and briefly as possible.

¬†

# The Relationship Between Product Niches and Ad Performance

¬†

When it comes to digital advertising, understanding the relationship between product niches and ad performance is critical for optimizing ad campaigns and achieving high ROI. Product niches refer to specific, well-defined segments of the market that a product or service caters to.

¬†These niches often consist of customers with specialized needs, preferences, or interests, making them distinct from broader market categories. The interplay between product niches and ad performance is significant because it influences targeting, messaging, and overall campaign effectiveness.

Here‚Äôs a closer look at how product niches impact ad performance:

¬†

# Targeting Precision

¬†

The first advantage of opting for the niche product category is the opportunity to refine and aim at customers. They are smaller and more distinct from other larger categories, therefore businesses can create adverts void of much generalization.¬†

Campaigns can be even more targeted from the demographics, interests and specific behaviors and buying patterns of this particular market segment.

* For example, when you have a business that deals with the sales of organic cleaning products, you get to advertise to them rather than the general population. This precision minimizes the probability of funneling ad spend to individuals that are unlikely to interact or make a purchase.

¬†On the other hand, universal targeting (e.g. using the message ‚Äòbuy all home cleaning products‚Äô) may generate less effectiveness and a lower ROI because the viewers are not very precise to the product type.

The objective of proper niche targeting is to enhance the overall ad CTR, conversion rate and, therefore, return on Investment (ROI) values. The more specific the audience is, the closer such people are to the ad and can promptly take some action.

¬†

# Ad Messaging and Relevance

¬†

When it comes to product niches, the fine connection between ad performance and the degree of match between the ad message and the target audience‚Äôs needs, values, and pain points. Strategically, ad messages in niche markets are far easier to develop and fine tuned to appeal to a specific target market.¬†

This makes it easier to appeal to the audience, and in the process improve the chances of reaping the intended attention.

* For instance, a rich man‚Äôs travel agency advertisement will most probably be effective in reaching the audience if it included privileges like private tours and other VIP-like services.¬†

On the other hand, a commercial advertising travel offers where the tourists are the prime audience will contain messages about the financial aspect of traveling.

¬†

There is also an opportunity in niche advertising to call attention to such small selling points as you may have that make your product distinct from the typical rivals.

¬†Targeted ads that get personal to the needs and wants of the targeted segment can elicit a more favorable response more often than not because of the positive emotional trigger.

¬†

# ¬†Cost-Effectiveness

¬†

Indeed, advertising in niche markets often helps the brand to save more money because it targets the audience which is smaller, but more defined. Thus, when the ad is targeted sensitively on the particular category of audience, then the competition is comparatively lower than that of competition on broad market segments.

* For instance, targeting vegan skincare products would produce a low bidding price for these keywords in Google AdWords as compared to ‚Äòskincare‚Äô or ‚Äòbeauty products.

Furthermore, niche ads are more effective than other common ads because more individuals are likely to click on them. Better conversion rates are often associated with improved cost per acquisition (CPA) and return on ad spend (ROAS) making niche advertising more cost-effective for your business.¬†

When targeting the right audience, brands can now extend their advertising dollar while still reaping great gains.

¬†

# Increased Competition and Niche Saturation

¬†

Even though using a product niche allows winning in targeting an ad, it is vital to notice that during this time the niche can become rather oversaturated. Competition becomes stiff within the niche as more and more business ventures improve on their marketing strategies to target such markets.

¬†It can increase the price for advertising and even worsen the effectiveness of advertising campaigns because several brands compete for the same keywords or some niches of the audience.

As such, the businesses have to come up with ways of creating the more effective ad where they would post high performance or high value level. This might be achieved through better adverts, designing the right offers or providing improved customer services.¬†

Moreover, constant campaign tweaking and experimenting with new advertisements will enable people to keep advertising their campaigns from getting lost in the sea of advertisements.

¬†

# ¬†It focus on the Customer Loyalty and Long Term Values

¬†

Niche markets can involve customers with a high level of interest in product/service requirements and characteristics trademarks.¬†

Due to their passion for the products or services within that niche, it becomes easier to encourage them to become returning customers. Which in turn affects ad performance in the long run in a direct manner.

¬†

When a business has set its location and has customers that rely on its services, then satisfying customers will hopefully get others to spread the word from the experience they had. Organic promotion can be used alongside different paid campaigns as an enhancement tool.¬†

Also, relationships with special customers through ads, retargeting and loyalty programs will thus in the long-run shift the CLV/CAC ratio in a positive trend, specifically towards an improved CLV.

* For instance, a business selling photographic materials and equipments; may find it necessary to continue receiving business from other professionals such as photographers who will in turn recommend their assistants, colleagues and friends among others to the particular business.¬†

With customized ad and email marketing, the consumers will remain committed to the organization or brand in question so that they keep coming to make purchases hence enhancing the ad performance.

¬†

# Ad Platform Selection

¬†

Niche campaigns are also affected by the ad platforms where your ads are placed because these platforms determine how your ads are seen by people. Ideal products excel on particular marketplaces which are frequented by the target demographic.¬†

* For instance, Pinterest and Instagram are mostly preferred by lifestyle, apparel & cosmetics, and home d√©cor product categories, and thus optimal for niche specific categories in those sectors.

LinkedIn may be well applied for the business to business specialized niche market sectors like business consulting or explicit software solutions. The demographics of your niche target market is vital in determining in which platforms your advertising money should be invested.¬†

Advertising on the right site guarantees interaction and improved outcomes as compared to other media because the targets are normally achieved.

Moreover, it is also important to state that there may be a difference of the types of ads that work in a certain niche depending on the platform that the niche is being targeted at.¬†

* For instance,¬†[video ads](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-use-amazon-video-ads-to-boost-your-amazon-sales-in-2024/)¬†may prove useful on YouTube as well as Instagram while carousel ads could be useful for e-commerce stores targeting niche whispers. In targeting the customers the right ad format should be adopted based on the preferences of the target group.

¬†

# Scalability Challenges

¬†

Although its benefits focus on the target niche market where the brand enjoys a high degree of personalization and cost efficiency, the problem associated with it is the ability of the brand to expand its advertising campaign.

¬†Certainly, the scale of the specific customer segment can hold back the amount of traffic or conversion a brand can generate. If the niche is too narrow, the ad performance may very well reach saturation and may not be able to grow beyond this point without increasing the target market.

Cutting down the ad campaign type to the extent of making it into a niche one requires some pass-through. Brands can increase their niche by targeting the audience with a very similar need or introducing related commodities, or by entering into a related niche market.¬†

* For instance, a brand that deals in organic skincare products with interests in sensitive skin could extend its marketing campaign based on the theme of eco-tar, though they still majors on sensitive skin.

Still, the excessive expansion of the lists, with several related interests each containing many specialties, might hurt the targeting accuracy and ad effectiveness.¬†

The challenge often faced is how to balance the niche targeting approach and the scalability of the campaign so that ad performance is sustained when the business expands.

¬†

# ¬†The Effects of Ad Fatigue on Audience Participation

¬†

In niche markets, the target audience is fewer, which implies that after the same users viewed the same advert multiple times, the advert fatigue is likely to occur. With time, the attitude towards the same ads changes, and the return rate is thus low, making them ineffective.

¬†This may subsequently lower CTR while raising the CPC due to consumers becoming bored with the message that is being passed across to them.

One is to ensure that the number of ads one uses is changed regularly so that potential consumers do not get tired of seeing the same ads over and over.¬†

It is possible to alternate the ads with fresh offers, with a focus on other characteristics of products, or with the help of a change of the season, which will keep the audience interested in the advertisements.¬†

Further, using the cu content or bringing in and sharing the cu testimonials or collaborating with influencers is good to bring new ideas and the audience‚Äôs engagement.

¬†

# Enhancing Amazon Advertising through Product-Specific Ads

¬†

Amazon Ads are one of the best strategies for increasing traffic and sales on the platform but the problem with so many customers and competitors is often how to make your ads pop.¬†

Apparently, there exists a growth opportunity in¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†advertising that may ultimately enhance return on investment (ROI) and the possibility is realized through the use of product-specific ads.

¬†That is why, by selecting specific products, their specific characteristics, and target consumers, you can make your Amazon ads more relevant, effective and, therefore, increase your sales. Here‚Äôs how to improve your Amazon Ads with product-centric campaigns:

¬†

# Understand the Product‚Äôs Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

¬†

The initial process where you have the product at the core of your campaign is to analyze the specific message that each product offers to its consumers. Every product has a competitive advantage and it doesn‚Äôt matter if it pertains to the quality, price, features or smooth design.¬†

By identifying and thus pointing at this USP, you can generate top-notch and engaging ads that would cause the attention of the potential customers.

* For instance, if you are promoting a skincare cream, which comes for sale with a relatively higher price compared to others in the market, the cream‚Äôs USP has to be that it is made of natural substances that do not contain parabens or chemicals.¬†
* For example, when you had your product-centric advertisement, you could have closely lined this feature and made consumers conscious by letting them know that the product was environmentally friendly and free from chemicals.¬†

It follows therefore that by positioning the product‚Äôs attributes in close proximity to the needs of the consumer you end up with an ad that targets a specific segment of the market.

¬†

# Take advantage of Targeting Options on Amazon

¬†

With the world‚Äôs largest marketplace, you can advertise products, particular categories, or even a direct competitor. With product targeting, you are guaranteed that your ad will be shown at the exact time users are searching products in related categories to your product.¬†

This is a good chance to intercept high intent traffic as shoppers are already in a purchase frame of mind.

* For instance, if you are selling a collection of professional iron-encrusted kitchen utensils, you can reach out to users that are browsing through rival steel utensils brands. When you emphasize such things with your item‚Äîits wearing resistance, clean ability, or appropriateness for induction cooktops‚Äîthat means you provide a better option for clients who are willing to buy.

Product-oriented advertising campaigns are most effective when this equation runs on the concept ‚Äòmy product is better in some way than most of the competitors‚Äô or ‚Äòthis aspect of my product is better.‚Äô

¬†

# Make Highly Specific Keywords Every Product

¬†

Another major factor when considering the¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†ad campaign is keyword targeting. Do not use very generic keywords such as shoes, coffee or whatever you are selling, use the specific, descriptive and detailed keywords.¬†

The product specific campaigns should also focus on the specialty of your product since this is likely to pull in customers that are in the market for that particular product.

* For instance, if you are selling a portable blender targeted for athletes, it is better to type in keywords such as ‚Äòportable blender for smooth making‚Äô or ‚Äòblender for athletes‚Äô rather than ‚Äòblender‚Äô. These specific keywords will help your ad to appear in front of the desired user‚Äôs search results that are interested in purchasing these products, allowing to reach the audience that can instantly convert.

When you target the specific product, you ensure your ad is more relevant and liked therefore improving your Quality Score thus avoiding spending money on low converting searches.

¬†

# ¬†Maximizing the Product Listings for Advertising Compatibility

¬†

In a product-specific Amazon ad format, the association of the ad with the product‚Äôs listing is especially crucial. Whenever an ad is effective enough to compel a customer to click, they should be redirected to your product detail page where the listing has to be persuasive enough to support the ad message.¬†

If an ad comes with a promise that a particular product is on offer while in the product page, there is a different product offered, then it results in high bounce rates in addition to wasting the advertising money as well as potential sales.

Ensure that your product listing pages are in sync with the message you want to pass in your ads. The title of the product, the bullet points, the description and the¬†**listing images**¬†should be closely related to the ad text and should refer only to the benefits of the product.

¬†If your ad focuses on the environmental friendliness of your product, for instance, make sure the product‚Äôs page highlights the environmental-friendliness of your product.

Of course, providing clear and high-resolution images, and videos, where your product is presented in action is significant as well.

¬†Product focused campaigns are most effective when the ad encounter is superior, in the sense that from the point the consumer clicks on the ad, the subsequent process leading up to a purchase decision is eased.

¬†

# Utilise Sponsored Products and Sponsored Brands

¬†

There are several ad formats available on Amazon FBA : however, for the product-based campaigns, Sponsored Products and the newer¬†[Sponsored Brands](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-sponsored-brands-ads-a-quick-tutorial/)¬†are optimal.

Sponsored Products are targeted by keywords and make up paid ads that can be found in the actual search results pages and the product pages.¬†

They are useful in the advertisement of single items. As all these ads appear on product listing and search results, these ads can result in direct conversions since they target clients with a high inclination towards purchasing.

Sponsored Brands enables you to advertise within¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†several products, in your brand, on the search results or product detail page. The main idea of this ad format is more broad than others, but it can be a campaign about a specific category or a set of products even within this format.¬†

It also assists in the branding process as well as marketing of specific products in the marketplace. Both of the ad formats allow the user to employ targeting options like keyword targeting, product targeting, target audience targeting to reach the potential while increasing probabilities of conversions.

¬†

# Measure and Manage High Volume Products

¬†

You will not find that every product you have in your catalog is perfectly performed to the optimum effect. In order to optimize every product based campaign, one should focus on the promotion of the products that may be expected to deliver high results on the cost of advertising (ROAS).

¬†Go to your sales, examine each product and find those articles that have the highest turnover rate, the greatest margin and amazing customer feedback.

In this way, you guarantee that most of the money spent on advertising goes to products that give better chances of success. Further, applied to these high priority products, you can more effectively fine tune your targeting and marketing communications message to the potential customer.

¬†

# Make use of Dynamic Creative Optimization or DCO.

¬†

Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO) is the feature in which you can design and compare several different ads. It requires less production time than filming a new advert and because it always revolves around products it can be tweaked to highlight a different feature of the product or target a different audience.

* For instance, one version of an ad can be about your product‚Äôs features, and the other can be about pricing strategies, and then you would compare the results for particular audiences.

**Amazon FBA**¬†‚Äôs dynamic ad solutions allow you to define creatives based on the KPIs you‚Äôre aiming for, so your product-focused ads are always getting better.

Ok so I work for an amazing company that sends me all over the USA for contracts of 3-6 months average.  I'm often in hotels or airbnbs for extended amounts of time and am always living out of my suitcase. Sometimes I'm traveling alone, sometimes with my wife and dog. Sometimes I may be in one place the entire time and sometimes I may be traveling back and forth checking out each time. Most of the time I'm bringing two weeks worth of clothes, some basic kitchen stuff like a couple of plates, bowls, cutlery and a waterpurifier pitcher, along with my basic shower and shave gear, my laptop bag and my xbox. If were all together at an Airbnb I may bring more kitchen stuff including food, if its just me in a hotel I may bring less. All of this is fine but the part I hate the most is packing and unpacking all the time. I believe my issue comes down to that of modularity.
 I always loved the idea of campaign furniture.  The thought that at a moments notice and with virtually no packing we can just up and relocate with ease. Im sure stuff like this still exists and hopefully has even modernized quite a bit but all my searching has been muddled down with day bags and the types of luggage that would be perfect for a week long vacation but not really great for someone whos about to spend the coldest part of the year in the coldest part of the country. 
I have had some luck with a modular Baur toolbox I bought from Harbor Freight. Each layer is desicnated for a different purpose and when its time to go they can all be stacked back up quickly. Its a little bulky but it is a lot better then just usuing a bunch of reusable bags for some of this stuff like I was doing before.
Unfortunately it's not even just luggage or the miscellaneous furniture we might need here or there but having things like how to safely and easily transport a burner plate or a grittle in case the place you end up doesn't have a stove. Unfortunately there are people out there who don't understand how inconvenient and potentially dangerous it can be to rent out space without including a coffee maker. 
  I guess I dont have a direct question per say but I am hoping for some ideas that might make this kinda lifestyle easier.  Anything would be appreciated. ",1,1739777306.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

He seems so free, and carefree. How I miss the times, he asked me if I'm happy and how are mom, dad, and our siblings?. I thought for a moment when he asked me that question. And smiled "" I am, and don't whatever your worrying about will never happen, and they are proud of what we have become, though I am still a work in progress what ever action we do, as long as its for the sake of the greater good will be backed by them, "" I patted him in the back, ""Don't worry to much about them being disappointed in you, there just guiding you to be better. 

My past self smiled, as he stare up in the ceiling. "" If only I could be as courageous as you."" I simply smiled and thought "" Oh how I wish I had the same carefree attitude of yours, maybe that's what I have missed growing up. 

He was about to leave since he has a curfew, while I'm going to be staying here for a while longer. Looking at my younger self back one more time, I shouted once last time "" Good luck out there, and don't be scared of failing."" He smiled and gave me a thumbs up.

I truly literally feel absolutely nothing when someone calls me beautiful, it‚Äôs all just so meaningless. Today the creepy regular that stares at me while he eats came by again and my manager grilled me

I‚Äôm actually the only that speaks fluent english at this place but they definitely know english flirting. They‚Äôre like hey we‚Äôre all just kidding we‚Äôre all work wives and husbands everyone jokes around and teases and it makes shifts more fun but with the language barrier and a bit of respect no one actually exchanges numbers or makes it more complicated like actual typical restaurant dating messiness.

When I first got hired everyone was huddled eating and I‚Äôm just standing off to the side but this one cook always included me in group stuff or told me dinner was ready and grab it before others took it. When all the girls would get coffee without me he‚Äôd get me something. I never opened up and with the language barrier he doesn‚Äôt know the details of what customers say but when im quiet or feeling weird he says you seem tired or unhappy and comes over with a snack. To a depressed bitch this means everything lol. 

I got yelled at by my manager and I obviously was not in the mood to eat dinner and he kept encouraging me to have dinner when I was the only not eating and standing off to the side and just wanted to be alone. And I whispered that I cried because of the manager and he encouraged me to forget about it and be happy. I know it‚Äôs silly and at the end of the day he just likes me for my face or body and I‚Äôm just a girl in the endless stream of pretty waitresses that are a dime a dozen and revolve through here. For gods sakes he was just bantering and flirting with another girl this morning. But i just wanted to be held and cry in his arms. 

But there are cameras everywhere with mics and manager loves to watch us so I didn‚Äôt. Then a couple days later he asked me how old I was forgetting he already asked me that when we first met. Of course I‚Äôm the weird one who actually took it to mean more than it was but now i really actually like this guy that calls me beautiful 20x a shift. There‚Äôs something endearing about a dopey class clown guy who always makes people laugh and is unashamed about everyone teasing him about how much he‚Äôs obsessed with me. Starts and ends everything with hey im just joking im just kidding but‚Ä¶it got real‚Ä¶for me‚Ä¶

Dogs look ridiculous with moustaches. Why are so many of them made that way? Or, if they're going to have them, why don't any dogs wear them with moustache wax like cartoon villains, you know, twisted at the ends? Why are there no dogs with goatees?

Raisin bread. I love raisin bread. But lately every brand I've bought does this creepy thing in my mouth where it falls apart like some kind of nasty paper mache. And the raisins leave an aftertaste like green fruit. Are they too cheap to wait for the grapes to get ripe now? 

And bacon! The last pack of bacon I bought cost the same, but it contained seven pieces of meat cut absolutely paper thin. I cook it for me and my roommate sometimes. Do they have any idea of the kind of existential crisis an odd number of slices causes me first thing in the morning? I haven't even had coffee yet!

Why is there so much stuff on tv, but all of it is crap? Why is it so hard to find good science fiction content? And howcome nobody has stuff with robots anymore? And ray guns! And force fields! And rockets! While I'm on the subject, why are there no romances involving robots? I like robots! If I was walking alone in the woods, what I would really like is to run into a robot. We could have kinky forest sex, and then walk around talking to random bears with no fear. 

Why do I fall asleep immediately after dinner now? Or anytime I try to listen to an audio book? It's so frustrating! I eat my dinner watching Gutsick Gibbon talk about paleoanthropology and then I get cold so I lay down to listen to some nice man on youtube read a story about robots and the next thing I know it's 3am and NOW I want to get up and rant on reddit! What is wrong with me? 

Did anyone ever tell you that when you get older, your feet get bigger? No? No one told me either! Do you have any idea how hard it is to find cute shoes in size 11? Especially cute shoes that I can climb a ladder and tar a roof in. Is it too much to ask that I can look halfway cool while doing manual labor for the patriarchy? What I want is a pair of doc martens that I can slip on that support my arches and somehow have kitten heels too. Is that so hard?

Memories that I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a figment of imagination.¬†

Do you think I‚Äôm not hurting? I can‚Äôt trust myself, and I am the only person I am stuck with for the entirety of my life. Do you think I‚Äôd lie about shit like this? Do you think I‚Äôm an attention-seeking whore because you‚Äôll never understand? To be getting better, then suddenly your self-worth hits an all-time low. To be going back to your depressive habits after doing so fucking good. To be lonely and surrounded by people who supposedly support you.¬†

Trust me, having to hang on to my shit is not fun. Planning to skip meals if I have to go down is no fun. It‚Äôs not because of fucking guilt. It‚Äôs fucking because I‚Äôm avoidant in my own emotions. This is the first time I have faced my own emotions. I am breaking out as of now.

If I were to get revenge, would I be satisfied? Just let CPS do its thing even though I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs innocent, though he could be. But he has hurt me for years. But isn‚Äôt it more satisfying to make them watch me succeed? For me to do what they thought I could not. Besides, revenge is pathetic. Remember, Belle? It‚Äôs tempting.¬†

1ire5kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1ire5kk/the_loneliness_epidemic_is_killing_us/,The Loneliness Epidemic is Killing Us.,"Lately, I‚Äôve been noticing something: no one talks to each other anymore. I‚Äôll be at a coffee shop, waiting in line, and everyone is staring at their phones. No one is making eye contact, no one is smiling, no one is striking up a conversation. I go on a walk in my neighborhood, pass by someone, and instead of saying ‚Äúgood morning,‚Äù they look down or pretend not to see me. I remember when people used to chat with strangers more often‚Äîcompliment someone‚Äôs dog, talk about the weather, maybe even make a new friend. Now, it feels like we‚Äôve all retreated into our own little digital worlds, avoiding real-life interactions like they‚Äôre an inconvenience.

This lack of human connection isn‚Äôt just sad‚Äîit‚Äôs actually bad for us. Chronic loneliness has been linked to increased stress, higher blood pressure, and even a weakened immune system. Studies show that people who feel socially isolated have a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and even dementia. Our bodies were built for connection‚Äîwhen we don‚Äôt have it, our nervous systems go into overdrive, flooding us with cortisol (the stress hormone), which can lead to anxiety, depression, and trouble sleeping. It‚Äôs like our brains are constantly on high alert, sensing danger where there is none, simply because we lack the comfort of human interaction.

I don‚Äôt think people want to be this disconnected. I think deep down, we all crave real, human interaction‚Äîwe‚Äôve just forgotten how to get there. And honestly, making the first move feels awkward now. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôve been conditioned to keep our heads down, to stay in our own bubbles, to avoid any interaction that isn‚Äôt strictly necessary. But the thing is, the smallest interactions can make a huge difference.

So, I‚Äôve been trying to change things for myself. Nothing drastic‚Äîjust little shifts to help me feel more present, more human. When I‚Äôm waiting in line, I keep my phone in my pocket and look around. If the cashier asks how my day is going, I actually answer instead of just mumbling ‚Äúgood‚Äù and moving on. If I see someone with a cool jacket or nice shoes, I compliment them. It might sound insignificant, but these small moments of connection add up.

And you know what? I‚Äôve realized that people do want to connect. The other day, I was at the grocery store and made a comment about how unpredictable the weather has been lately. The woman next to me laughed and said, ‚ÄúRight? I never know how to dress anymore!‚Äù It was such a small moment, but for just a second, we weren‚Äôt two strangers‚Äîwe were just two people, sharing a little piece of life together.

I know life is busy. I know it‚Äôs easier to stay in our routines, to keep scrolling, to assume that no one else wants to be bothered. But I also know that when we take a second to be present, to acknowledge each other, to have real conversations, it makes life feel so much better.

So, if you‚Äôve been feeling this loneliness too, maybe try what I‚Äôm doing. Put the phone down when you‚Äôre out in public. Say hi to your neighbors. Smile at strangers. Say ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù more. Make eye contact. Call a friend just to check in. Don‚Äôt let life pass you by while you‚Äôre staring at a screen. Because at the end of the day, connection is what makes life meaningful.

I will not be buying textbooks early, its better to buy on campus for cost and the professor might never use one of the ""required"" textbooks. Double sided tape is for hanging posters, and the hooks are for towels and other hanging items.

Employers need your bank info and routing number, and require you to have a passport or i.d. and a birth certificate. If you have an emergency or need prescription meds knowing your health insurance info is helpful.

not for me:

* sunscreen & bug spray
* broom
* fridge & microwave
* makeup & makeup remover
* ruler, calculator, hard drives, etc.
* religious supplies (prayer mat, holy book, smudging materials)
* shaving supplies
* cold medicine & melatonin
* bathrobe & sleep mask
* sunglasses & baseball caps

these are all items that are probably important for many people but I don't have any use for. 

to avoid:

* mesh shower caddy
* fabric/enclosed hamper
* laundry pods & scent beads
* strong fragrances
* toothbrush caps

mesh shower caddies, fabric hampers, and toothbrush caps all trap moisture and make stuff mildewy. laundry pods and scent beads are terrible for the environment as well as cleaning and cost effectiveness. Use a powder detergent or detergent sheets. I like using white vinegar as a laundry booster (and to clean electric kettles!). Lastly, don't buy strong air fresheners and candles, the smell can cause headaches and discomfort for everyone else. The best way to keep a room smelling clean is to shower frequently, change bedding & wash laundry often, and take out the trash & avoid food in the dorm room. Keep a fan circulating and open a window for a few minutes a day for fresh air, especially in the winter.

I wrote this list for myself so you will likely not need everything listed and you will also have to bring stuff I didn't remember. Consider the weather of your school, read your colleges dorm info, and think about your budget and what works for you. Talk to your roommate, especially for large items like coffee makers, fridges, rugs, and other appliances.

I hope this helps & good luck!",1,1739775955.0,dormrooms,0,1.0,False

I know many people dream of being able to walk around their ship, and I also understand that this isn‚Äôt an easy feat from a technical perspective. So, I came up with an idea. Imagine the following: Frontier releases a new $30 DLC (let‚Äôs call it¬†*Expedition*). It adds a checkbox in the pause menu that says ""Always On Foot.""

Once you enable this option, your game would switch to Odyssey mode, even if you‚Äôre controlling a ship. They would have to ""redo"" ship gameplay within Odyssey, but I believe they could reuse some of the existing codebase. Since you‚Äôre always on foot, you could get up from your chair, walk around your ship, or step outside without any loading screens.

Now, here are some conditions:

* The DLC price is $30.
* Both Odyssey and Expedition are considered live servers, as no new game mode is introduced.
* Odyssey players can see Expedition players‚Äô movements (just like you can see someone on foot on a fleet carrier while flying a ship).
* ARX interior customization.
* Small details would be implemented: bartenders actually selling drinks that you can enjoy with a friend, coffee machines making coffee, and more interactive decorative points.

It was probably the most nervous I have ever been, and it definitely showed.

He said no (obviously) and this is the part where it gets really embarrassing. Idk what came over me, but I started to cry. It happened so quickly and before I even noticed what was happening, tears were streaming down my face. I apologized and rushed out of there as fast as I could. 

Idk why I started crying. I have a lot of issues with crushing loneliness, and I think in that moment they all came rushing out. 

Well I went to the club the next week, only for the leader of the club to tell me that I can't try to guilt trip people like that, and that it made him really uncomfortable. Apparently after I left, he went to the club president and told him that I tried to guilt trip him.

It took everything I had to not start crying right then and there. I wasn't trying to guilt trip anyone, I didn't want to manipulate him, I just couldn't stop myself from crying. I feel so fucking ashamed.

1irdq0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1irdq0z/honestly_best_self_help_books/,[HONESTLY] Best Self Help Books,"Alright, folks, let me tell you, I‚Äôve been on the quest for the best self-help books for a while now. Like, I‚Äôve read enough ‚Äúself-improvement‚Äù books to start a small library at this point. But *two* really stood out to me in the last few months ‚Äî *Atomic Habits* by James Clear and *Don‚Äôt Believe Everything You Think* by Thomas Kida.

Let‚Äôs dive in!

**Atomic Habits: Building Good Habits One Tiny Step at a Time**

First off, if you're like me and have tried every ""new year, new me"" resolution only to find yourself binge-watching Netflix by February, *Atomic Habits* might just change your life. James Clear gives you the science-backed blueprint for habit formation, and he does it in a way that doesn‚Äôt make you feel like you need to quit caffeine cold turkey to make meaningful change.

In a nutshell, the book explains how tiny, almost imperceptible changes can have massive long-term impacts. You know that thing you‚Äôve always wanted to do, like exercising every day or eating healthier? *Atomic Habits* shows you how to break down those overwhelming goals into bite-sized habits that you can actually stick with.

Here's the real kicker: After reading it, I decided to start by drinking a glass of water every morning right when I wake up (I used to just start my day with coffee and nothing else). It felt like nothing, but now it's automatic, and I'm way more hydrated and less cranky by 10 a.m. (who knew that water could be a life-changer?).

**BTW I Got Mine For Really Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/4k0DUuw)

**Don‚Äôt Believe Everything You Think: Your Brain Is Not Always Right**

Now, onto *Don‚Äôt Believe Everything You Think*. This book might be one of the most mind-blowing self-help reads I‚Äôve come across. The author, Thomas Kida, takes you on a deep dive into how our brains can be pretty terrible at distinguishing fact from fiction. Spoiler alert: your brain is a master at coming up with stories that may not be true, and they might be holding you back without you even realizing it.

This book helped me realize that I often believed thoughts like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough for this job,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be able to stick with this routine.‚Äù But guess what? These thoughts were simply stories I was telling myself. Kida gives you solid strategies for identifying these negative thought loops and replacing them with a more rational, evidence-based approach. It‚Äôs kind of like having a mental filter for all the *crap* your brain tries to feed you.

I‚Äôll give you a real-life example: a couple of months ago, I had a big presentation coming up for work. My brain kept telling me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to mess this up. You‚Äôre going to sound stupid.‚Äù But after reading Kida‚Äôs book, I stopped and thought, ‚ÄúOkay, is that *really* true?‚Äù I was prepared, I had my notes, and I‚Äôd been practicing. My brain was just trying to sabotage me for no reason. Long story short: nailed it. Thanks, brain‚Ä¶or not.

**BTW I Got Mine For Really Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/41jXhaH)

**Final Thoughts:**

If you‚Äôre looking for the best self-help books that will actually *stick* and make a tangible difference in your life, I highly recommend giving *Atomic Habits* and *Don‚Äôt Believe Everything You Think* a try. Together, they‚Äôre a powerhouse combo: one helps you form habits that last, and the other helps you clear the mental clutter holding you back.

Both books are easy to read, practical, and they‚Äôll have you questioning your old habits and thought patterns in no time. Also, you don‚Äôt need to quit caffeine (unless you want to, of course).

1irdpr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1irdpr8/honestly_best_stick_vacuum/,[HONESTLY] Best Stick Vacuum,"So, I finally pulled the trigger on a stick vacuum after convincing myself for far too long that my old upright would *totally* handle my messes. Spoiler: It did not. I have a cat that sheds enough fur to make me question her life choices, and I needed something that would actually make my floors look like they belong to an adult and not a tumbleweed.

Enter the [Bissell Cleanview XR Pet 300W](https://amzn.to/4k4WfH0), which I now lovingly refer to as ""The Fur Terminator."" And I mean it. This vacuum has single-handedly changed the game for me. Let me break it down for you:

# The Design:

I was honestly expecting the usual bulky vacuum setup, but this thing is lightweight and *actually* easy to maneuver. No more awkwardly dragging a giant contraption around like I'm preparing to battle a dust monster. It's sleek, compact, and doesn‚Äôt feel like I need to be training for a strongman competition to use it. You know when you have those moments where you‚Äôre vacuuming and you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúWow, I might actually break a sweat here‚Äù? Yeah, that doesn‚Äôt happen with this vacuum.

# The Power:

I‚Äôm no vacuum expert, but this thing has some serious suction power. It gobbles up everything in its path ‚Äî cat hair, crumbs, you name it. It's got a 300W motor that lets it go to town on even the messiest of messes. Just this morning, I was cleaning up after breakfast (I swear I don‚Äôt *always* spill food) and the Bissell didn‚Äôt hesitate to suck up all the cereal bits I ""accidentally"" dropped. I even used it on the couch (because I‚Äôm that person who spills coffee there too), and it did wonders without me having to vacuum in circles for an hour.

**BTW I Got Mine For Really Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/4k4WfH0)

# Pet Hair? No Problem:

I don‚Äôt know if anyone else can relate, but pet hair is like that one friend who overstays their welcome ‚Äî always there and *always* causing problems. The Bissell Cleanview XR Pet has a special pet brush that is a total game-changer. I tested it on my living room rug where my cat decides to take her midday naps, and I couldn‚Äôt believe how much hair it picked up. I was legitimately *grossed out* by how much fur had been lurking around. But hey, the Cleanview XR definitely got the job done.

# Real-Life Example:

So, picture this: it‚Äôs a lazy Sunday afternoon. I‚Äôm binge-watching Netflix, and my cat is in full-on ""throw all my toys around"" mode. Within minutes, the living room looks like a tornado hit it. Normally, this would‚Äôve been the moment I sighed, grabbed a broom, and spent the next 45 minutes chasing after every hairball and stray feather. But not today. Today, I grabbed my **Bissell Cleanview XR Pet 300W**, popped on the pet brush, and in less than 10 minutes, the room was spotless. I even managed to finish one episode of *The Office* before it was time to clean up the kitchen.

# Battery Life:

I was also a little nervous about the battery life since I didn‚Äôt want to be in the middle of a cleaning spree only to have it die on me. Fortunately, the battery lasts long enough for me to clean my whole apartment, and then some. It charges quickly, so I don‚Äôt have to plan my cleaning time around it like it‚Äôs some kind of life event. Plus, it has a handy charging dock so it doesn‚Äôt take up a ton of space.

# The Verdict:

So, is the [Bissell Cleanview XR Pet 300W](https://amzn.to/4k4WfH0) the best stick vacuum? 100% yes. Whether you're dealing with pet hair, crumbs from your ‚Äúquick snack‚Äù that somehow turned into a full meal, or just general day-to-day messes, this vacuum is a lifesaver. It's light, powerful, and does the job so quickly that I actually find myself looking forward to vacuuming now (never thought I‚Äôd say that). If you‚Äôve got pets or just want a hassle-free vacuum experience, I seriously can‚Äôt recommend it enough.

In conclusion, stop dragging around that heavy vacuum and let this bad boy do the heavy lifting. You'll thank me later. üôå

1irdplp,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1irdplp/honestly_best_standing_desk/,[HONESTLY] Best Standing Desk,"Okay, I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äì I wasn‚Äôt sold on the idea of a standing desk at first. I mean, sure, standing is good for your back and all, but I figured it‚Äôs just another trendy ‚Äúworkplace upgrade‚Äù that would gather dust while I sit at my desk, hunched like a gremlin. But after months of back pain, I decided to give the [FLEXISPOT EN1 Whole-Piece Standing Desk](https://amzn.to/3QlqUC1) a try, and folks, it‚Äôs a game changer.

**Let‚Äôs start with the basics:**

The **FLEXISPOT EN1** isn‚Äôt just any standing desk. This bad boy has a sleek, sturdy frame that can handle all my junk ‚Äî er, I mean, *important work equipment*. I‚Äôve got a monitor, a laptop, some coffee mugs (yes, plural), and more sticky notes than I care to admit. I‚Äôve crammed it all on this desk, and it hasn't budged once.

I was expecting it to take a while to get up and running, but the setup was **super easy**. Like, ""Hey, I actually might be able to assemble furniture without losing my sanity"" easy. No joke. The instructions were clear, the pieces fit perfectly, and I had it set up in under 30 minutes. (I know, right? I was shocked too.)

**The real magic happens when you start using it:**

I‚Äôve been using the FLEXISPOT EN1 for about a month now, and let me tell you, the ability to switch from sitting to standing at the push of a button has been life-changing. I‚Äôm one of those people who can sit for hours and forget I haven‚Äôt moved. (I once sat so long that when I tried to stand up, my legs went numb. Not my finest moment.) But with this desk, I can easily adjust the height at the press of a button. It‚Äôs like I have my own personal workout routine, but without the sweat and commitment.

**BTW I Got Mine For Really Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/3QlqUC1)

**Real-Life Example (aka, my personal victory):**

One of the best moments so far? Last Friday, I was on a Zoom call (you know, the kind where you‚Äôre trying to look professional but secretly trying to find a way to prop up your laptop without looking like you're in a weird, squished position). Mid-call, I had a lightbulb moment ‚Äî I stood up, adjusted the desk, and immediately felt like a more productive human being. I stopped slouching, felt more alert, and could even focus on the call without being distracted by my back screaming at me. Win-win.

**Is this the best standing desk?**

Absolutely. The [FLEXISPOT EN1](https://amzn.to/3QlqUC1) is sturdy, easy to adjust, and looks sleek. It has saved me from back pain, improved my posture, and made me feel like a grown-up who actually cares about my health. (No more hunching over like Quasimodo.) Plus, the build quality is top-notch, so I feel like it‚Äôs going to last me a long time.

I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm an evangelist for standing desks now (okay, maybe I am), but if you‚Äôre tired of your back telling you it‚Äôs time to upgrade, do yourself a favor and get this one. Your body will thank you. üëè

If you‚Äôre in the market for the **best standing desk**, the **FLEXISPOT EN1 Whole-Piece Standing Desk** is definitely worth checking out. No more excuses ‚Äî your back will thank you later.

1irdnpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/1irdnpf/networking_while_on_the_bench_as_a1_how/,"Networking while on the bench as A1, how?","A1 Audit, started a month ago, with only 2.5 weeks of client experience, and now on the bench. Spoke to the deployment staff and my coach and put out the word I‚Äôm flexible and looking for work. Reached out to one of the higher ups on this last short engagement but nothing panned out. 

Multiple Reddit posts suggest reaching out to people, seniors and mangers and to network with people you don‚Äôt know. However, first I just started so I don‚Äôt have anyone I can lean on. Second how would I even go about doing that? From my last engagement in those two weeks, I had short interactions with managers, do I send them a ping asking if they have any work they can staff me on and hope that I left a good enough impression they will say yes? 

The deployment leader suggested I become visible and spend more time in the office so I get seen and roped into work or used the word network.

Even if I go into the office which I plan on doing anyways, to focus on trainings and learning. How does an A1 approach managers and ask for coffee chats and then proceed to sell myself to give me work, when they know I‚Äôm brand new and need training. 

Do I ask the deployment manager if there was negative feedback, would he even tell me the truth? 

TLDR: Need some steps on how to network to find work. Don‚Äôt trust the deployment leader has the same urgency because he‚Äôs not worried about utilization.

A pancake 2 strips of bacon and an egg was 2.75. In what reality could you have the same buying power for 6.46 which is allegedly the difference in inflation. That meal would cost double that at the very least, even at a chain let alone a family owned  restaurant like the one this menu is from. 

Maybe I don‚Äôt understand the calculation to inflation calculators but they seem way off to me. Not even close to what things actually cost shouldn‚Äôt that be what it‚Äôs reflecting? ",2,1739773728.0,economicCollapse,0,1.0,False

We are best friends and do everything together. We enjoy each other‚Äôs company and love spending time with each other. But over time sex has been less and less. She has a low sex drive, which I understand. But it went from once a week to every two weeks and now maybe once a month. We had discussed before about our expectations for sex. But I feel like I am the only one that puts in effort for it. 

The frequency of sex bothers me but is only a small reason why I don‚Äôt want sex. It start with her ignoring my advances. I can handle being rejected but her acting like nothing happened to not have sex hurts. I tried openly communicating my desires, which was her idea, but she would reject me. I tried getting her in the mood, building it up throughout the day, us sexting, spoiling her, and nothing would still happen.  So I stopped trying.  Slowly things that she does started turning me off, watching TikTok, playing games on her phone, her saying everyday ‚Äúmy body hurts‚Äù. I wanted something more than the occasional quick sex where she lays there.

Things that didn‚Äôt bother me now do. She‚Äôs lazy.  I feel more like a care giver than her husband. I get her everything. All I hear is, I want coffee, I‚Äôm hungry, get me‚Ä¶ she just sits around on TikTok or plays games and does nothing for herself. And when I don‚Äôt do something for her she wines. She has the expectation that I do everything for her. I wouldn‚Äôt feel so annoyed if she did anything for me. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have no drive for sex with her. A month ago when she was in the mood I couldn‚Äôt. It has started to effect other parts of our marriage. ",3,1739773146.0,Marriage,41,0.59,False
