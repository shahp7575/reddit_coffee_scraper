1owsjfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlinsocialclub/comments/1owsjfh/getting_friends_after_30s_is_very_well_possible/,Getting friends after 30s is very well possible,"# I was going to reply to another post that stated the opposite but OP deleted it, so I thought I'd share my experience.

**Some background:**   
I'm male, a bit older than 30 and not from Berlin, though I lived here for several years.  
I've made some friends during those years, and many of them exactly in the last two years.

How have I done it?  
  
\- *Common activities and hobbies*. I know, it's a cliché, but it works: I've started one exactly two years ago and brought many new connections that ended up becoming friends.  
If you share something together, you may end up being friends.  
Which brings me to the second point:  
  
\- *Share something valuable with them*. There are many definitions for a friend, but in a city that's mostly superficial, if you want to find good friends, be there for them.   
Give them your trust and trust them, share imporant thoughts and talks, not just small talk.  
Ask how they are, and be there for them (in your own capacity).  
  
\- *Like all relationships, they that time and effort. A lot.*  
We need time and commitment to get to know other people and understand if we want to spend time with them.  
Don't just expect people to become best friends from one day to the other. I've met one of my latest friends through Hinge last year. We matched, met couple of times, didn't had sex but ended up being friends a while after. Yes, that's possible!  
  
\- *Take action, meet new people*  
I've read once in the Sisy group something that stuck with me: ""The moment you just passively expect (something) to come from the outside world.. well, just imagine if everyone else also did that. Everybody waiting for everybody.""  
Don't wait, ask the others out. For a coffee, for a book, a suggestion you want to have, or want to give. For any interests you might share, or hey, maybe you don't share yet! They practice a sport you don't know yet? Good, try it out. But

\- *Be comfortable with rejection, present or belated*  
Meaning, you might wanna be friend with somebody, but they might not wanna be friend with you. Unfortunately, that's ok. Some friends come and go, especially in the big cities.  
I had a good friend for around six years, then they became more and more unrealiable, and eventually stopped writing me. Bummer, yes, but honestly, that's life. It happens.

\~

So, to sum it up: yes, it's possible to have friends after 30s.  
It takes time, patience, effort, trust, and being comfortable with being uncomfortable.

  
It's not easy, but it's totally doable.",5,1763114607.0,berlinsocialclub,2,0.78,False

Total coincidence. I was grabbing a coffee, she dropped something, we started talking — one of those random interactions that feels way too natural for strangers.
And man… the connection hit instantly.
She had everything: the vibe, the confidence, the beauty, the kind of figure that makes your eyes misbehave even when you try to be respectful. It felt like someone pressed pause on the world for a minute. I’ve never clicked with someone that fast.
We ended up hanging out that evening. Conversation flowed like we’d known each other for years. One thing led to another, and we decided to go to my room.
No lies — the chemistry was unreal. Lust completely overpowered logic.
Next morning, I woke up alone.
On the table beside me was a small folded note.
“Get yourself tested. I could not understand anything .
After a week i noticed pain while urinating, testical pain and unusual discharge.
I immediately rush to doctor and yeah — I was positive.it was Chlamydia. Doctor gave full of antibiotics. The digestion issue along with leave from work.and  mentally? I suffered way more.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **ASVEL Lyon Villeurbanne vs. KK Partizan NIS: A Tale of Two Offenses and One Defensive Mystery**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The bookmakers are practically screaming that **KK Partizan NIS** is the favorite here. At BetRivers, Partizan’s moneyline odds sit at **+1.36** (decimal), translating to an implied probability of **73.5%**. Meanwhile, ASVEL Lyon Villeurbanne, the home team, is priced at **+3.05**, implying just a **32.8%** chance to win. Even the spread reflects this dominance: Partizan is favored by **6.5 points**, suggesting they’ll win comfortably unless ASVEL’s offense collectively decides to take a coffee break mid-game.

The total line is set between **162.5 and 163.5 points**, which feels oddly conservative given both teams’ offensive prowess. ASVEL averages **86 points per game**, while Partizan scores **81.6**. Combined, they should theoretically tally **167.6 points**, yet the total is set lower. This discrepancy hints that either defenses are secretly training in secret (shh!) or the bookmakers are factoring in Partizan’s recent inconsistency—like their loss to Baskonia despite a 99-89 win over Anadolu Efes.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and Xavi’s Return**  
ASVEL enters this matchup fresh off a **75-74 victory over Bayern Munich**, a game that proved they can win with clutch shooting and a “hope for the best” mentality. Their offense is as reliable as a Lyon baker at 6 a.m.—consistent, but their defense? Let’s just say it’s the kind of defense that might let a toddler score if they wore a jersey with “I heart 3-pointers” on it.

Partizan, on the other hand, has a **12-game streak of scoring over 75 points**, but their defense has been… *sporadic*. They crushed Efes but stumbled against Baskonia, which raises the question: Are they a team tha

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

1owsb2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1owsb2s/i_should_not_be_smoking_marijuana_at_30yearsold/,I should not be smoking marijuana at 30-years-old the way that I am. Why is quitting so hard?,"What's so frustrating for me, is that when people are laughing at my Addictions on social media, particularly Facebook. People are hitting the haha reaction to mock and ridicule my addictions but I understand that it's entirely my fault. ""LOL crackhead!"" (like or laugh with by over 100 people). 

If anyone actually knew me, they would know that there is no such evidence that I have an addiction to harder substances like crack or meth. Marijuana is obviously the most dominating substance that I've suffered addiction from, however moderating alcohol was also a challenge, because there are many times where I could have 8-10 beers over 8-10 hours, even if I'm not feeling inebriated, drinking nine beers slowly throughout the entirety of the day would just be a total waste of time and money. Not to mention energy. I went over 168 days without drinking 4 years ago, and it was one of the best times of my life. 

What I want in my life, is to have a full-time job, and be completely self-sufficient with my finances. 

What I get in my life, is ODSP, so disability covers my apartment rent ($582/month) but only gives me $750 a month in two $375 payments on every 1st and 15th of the month, so I should be paid again tomorrow, but it's always those last few days just before I'm paid that I always seem the most irritable. 

Usually, I would just go for a walk to a local restaurant or whatever and get myself a coffee or even a meal, but now the only way I could get that is by the kindness of strangers, in order for me to get a fix of something. If I can't smoke weed, I'll just drink beer. If I can't drink beer, I'll just smoke cigarettes. If I can't smoke cigarettes, I'll just drink caffeine. If I have the luck of not having any of those four things, then I'm going to drink plenty of water. These types of behaviors, especially with so many different substances gives me the impression that I do suffer from an addictive personality disorder. 

If I'm going to be unemployed for another 6 years, what I need the focus on is discontinuing all harmful habits. This is not exclusive that just marijuana smoking, it's also a common problem with alcohol use, where when I can't smoke weed I will often drink beer to treat the withdrawals but when I can't have either, I then treat the withdrawals with tobacco or caffeine, if I can't treat my weed withdrawals with anything, I just drink fucking water. Simple H2O. 

Since about 3:00 a.m., I've had about 12 cups of water/12oz (4.26L?) and I feel much better than I'm hydrated, because if I wasn't drinking water I would be smoking weed and I already know that I have to quit but the problem with addiction is, somebody like me will continue to use the substances regardless of the negative consequences. 

Like CHS for example, if the marijuana withdrawals are bad, I can't even imagine how bad it would be to have constant stomach pains, occurring almost every month lasting for a week at times, and the only way I can relieve these symptoms is by taking a hot shower or bath. 

The only known cure for CHS, is by total cessation of cannabis use. 

I would love a rehab center, but unfortunately there are none available, I would love to be able to go to facility for 21 days, instead of having to go to the hospital every time for 2 weeks or however long, but the problem is as soon as I'm out of rehab I'll be right back to everyday again, and it would just seem pointless.

*  US — Tech-led risk-off continues after yesterday’s Nasdaq drop of more than **2%**, with bond-market volatility elevated as doubts grow over a December Fed rate cut and delayed economic data threaten larger swings (Bloomberg, WSJ).
* US — A widely watched fear-and-greed gauge sits in “extreme fear” near **22/100** this morning while S&P 500 index options show a put/call volume ratio around **1.1**, signaling heavy downside hedging beneath the surface (Stocknear, CNN-style gauge).
* US — Fed watchers highlight a sharper split between hawks and doves as Lael Brainard argues a December cut is warranted on softening labor data, while others warn the Fed is “flying blind” on late releases, keeping policy uncertainty high into year‑end (CNBC, Fox Business).
* US/LatAm — The US plans to phase out tariffs on bananas, coffee, beef and select apparel from Ecuador, Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala, easing some Trump-era duties and adding a modest tailwind for consumer and agriculture supply chains (WSJ).
* Global Tech/Cyber — AI and data-center–linked growth stories remain under pressure after a steep selloff in AI hardware and quantum-computing names and news of an AI-orchestrated cyberattack that hit cybersecurity stocks, reinforcing concerns over an early-stage AI bubble (CNBC, Reuters).



  
**Speculative Positioning**

* Index options traders keep S&P 500 put/call volume above **1.1** even as Technology call premium swells to roughly **$495B** vs about **$171B** in puts, signaling crowded upside speculation in AI leaders but persistent downside hedging at the index level.

**MAG7**

* [NVDA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NVDA) — Trades around **$184.65** premarket (**−1.2%**) as the market refocuses on the 19/11 earnings, where Wall Street expects revenue near **$54.7B** and EPS of roughly **$1.22**. Analysts remain firmly positive (median PT \~**$225–230**, \~**20%+** upside) while options flow shows aggressive call buying up the **$185–$220** strikes into the print and dark‑pool blocks above **$185** indicating large, but balanced, institutional positioning.
* [AAPL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AAPL) — Flat premarket near **$272.96** after holding up better than other mega-cap tech in yesterday’s de‑risking. Street consensus is “Buy” with a median PT around **$290–300** (high-teens upside); options flow is skewed to upside strikes in the **$260–$280** region and dark‑pool prints in the high **$260s–$270s** suggest continued institutional accumulation rather than profit‑taking.
* [MSFT](https://stocknear.com/stocks/MSFT) — Eases to about **$502.76** premarket (**−0.1%**) after heavy volume yesterday, as investors digest fresh multi‑billion‑dollar AI data‑center commitments and very strong recent results (last EPS beat by \~**13%** with revenue growth in the mid-teens). Analysts keep a “Buy” stance with a median PT near **$640** (\~**27%+** upside), and options activity is intense with large call blocks up to the **$560** strike and sizable dark‑pool blocks around **$503–$510** flagging dip‑buying by long‑only funds.
* [AMZN](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AMZN) — Trades around **$237.21** premarket (**−0.2%**) after a strong post‑earnings run driven by AWS acceleration and cost discipline. The analyst median PT near **$293–300** implies roughly **20–25%** upside, while options flow shows persistent call demand in the **$240–$260** range and dark‑pool prints above **$237** highlight ongoing institutional accumulation on weakness.
* [GOOGL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GOOGL) — Slightly softer premarket near **$277.78** (**−0.3%**) as EU regulatory probes into search, spam and AI news usage remain an overhang despite another big earnings beat (last quarter EPS +**26%** vs estimates, revenue +**9–10%**). Analysts stay bullish with a median PT around **$295–300** (\~**6–8%** upside from here), and options markets show active positioning in both long‑dated calls and protective puts around the **$280** line, consistent with institutional two‑way trading rather than capitulation.
* [META](https://stocknear.com/stocks/META) — Edges lower premarket near **$606.98** (**−0.5%**) as investors balance massive AI and data‑center capex against one of the strongest earnings beats in large‑cap tech (last EPS beat by \~**19%**, revenue +**9–10%**). Street targets cluster around **$825–850**, implying roughly **35%+** upside, while options flow is dominated by large, longer‑dated call structures out to **2026–2028** and dark‑pool prints around **$605–$610** suggest high‑conviction dip buying by institutions.
* [TSLA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TSLA) — Under pressure premarket around **$394.74** (**−1.8%**) after yesterday’s **−6.7%** slide, as the market digests softer China volumes, product‑quality headlines and executive churn.

Across indices, options and dark‑pool flows, the tape shows a bearish skew at the index level (high put demand, extreme fear readings) but ongoing, selective institutional buying in high‑quality AI and cloud leaders such as [NVDA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NVDA), [MSFT](https://stocknear.com/stocks/MSFT), [AMZN](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AMZN) and [META](https://stocknear.com/stocks/META).

For active traders, the setup is tactically bearish at the index level but constructively bullish on selective megacap AI: using index puts or short futures as macro hedges while gradually building positions in fundamentally strong winners, and treating high‑beta names like [TSLA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TSLA) as event‑driven trading vehicles rather than core holdings, aligns best with current positioning data.

The pitch sounded harmless, like a casual meet up  with snacks and a chance to “reconnect.” Most of us remote  folks thought it could be a chill day, maybe even fun, so around half the team signed up. When we showed up, it was nothing like what they advertised. No snacks, no coffee, not even a single chair moved for group work . Instead, there was this weird printed agenda taped to the wall with words like “rebuilding culture” and “reviving office energy.” They clearly expected everyone to suddenly go “ wow office life rocks ” even though we all just sat in silence  staring at our laptops because our actual tasks were still remote. The funniest part is that by lunch everyone dipped. People literally left in waves. My manager bailed first and pretended she had a dentist appointment, then two engineers left to “check on a delivery,” and at some point it was just me and a flickering overhead light. The next day the survey came out and the responses must have  been brutal because leadership quietly canceled all future collaboration days . Not even an announcement, the event page just disappeared like it never existed . Honestly it only reminded everyone how much better remote work feels.

Heat bloomed beneath the surface of her skin, sharp and sudden, like sparks catching fire. Amari gasped, eyes flicking open. The burning sensation crawled down her spine as if someone had been carving a sculpture underneath her skin. She twisted around, fists clenching the bed sheets. A hand steadied her.

“Amari, are you okay?” Aunt Suzan’s voice sounded distant.

She opened and closed her mouth, unable to utter a response. Her hand flew to her left shoulder blade, pressing where the pain flared hottest. Suzan pulled up her pyjama top. Her sharp gasp made Amari’s heart leap. The mark had to have grown again.

She wanted to ask, to inquire about its condition, but she wasn’t sure she wanted to hear it.

“Come on, breathe,” Suzan said as she jumped from the bed.

Amari forced herself to breathe. In through the nose and out through the mouth. The way her clinical instructor had taught them for managing patient anxiety. Suzan rummaged through their luggage, still sitting unpacked next to the dresser. She

found it. A small bottle Amari had seen so many times the sight of it alone left a bitter taste. Witches’ Hazel, earthy and woody, laced with the whispered chants of a witch forming a concoction.

Aunt Suzan laid Amari on her stomach as the cold paste seeped into her skin. The pain flared. She squeezed her eyes shut, breath coming in ragged heaves. She jerked her shoulder up, unable

to bear the feeling of thousands of needles prickling her skin. But Suzan pushed her down, continuously rubbing the paste, tracing the lines that had extended from the mark. The burning dulled to an ache and her ragged breathing gradually slowed.

She stopped struggling and remained still. But the pulsing didn’t stop, it never stopped anymore. The mark throbbed beneath her skin like a second heartbeat, persistent and alive.

“How are you feeling? Is it better?” Suzan asked, her hand lingering for a second too long on her back.

“Mh.”

Amari hummed the response, unable to form the words. It was a lie. One she had perfected for the past three years, hoping to ease Suzan’s anxiety. The Witches’ Hazel was failing. Each application brought her less relief than the last. But Suzan didn’t need to know that. Not yet.

“The mark has grown. I didn’t expect it to grow this much in a single night.”

Amari shifted from her sleeping position to look at Suzan. She didn’t know what to say. Suzan’s face shifted into something harder and more determined. “Malek will know what to do. This time I’m sure we are going to find a cure, or at least an extension. Don’t lose hope just yet.”

“I’m fine, don’t worry. Yesterday you were beaming with confidence about how strong Uncle Malek was, but now you look like the one who’s lost hope. ”

Amari forced a smile, trying to convince herself more than her aunt that Malek was powerful.

He could find a cure for her possession. Suzan’s face brightened. Amari could tell she was surprised. She’d never spoken of hope before, not like this. But something about being in Delmoor, about Malek’s confidence, made it feel possible again.

“Come now, go take a shower. Malek must already be in his witch-stead getting ready.”

Getting out of bed, she noticed the unfamiliar room for the first time. No whiteboard on the wall filled with notes on the anatomy of the heart, no detailed structure of the skeletal system, and definitely no pictures of her favourite anime. The bathroom looked different. The atmosphere was bleak and

almost suffocating compared to her room in Mountain Hill. For the first time, she’d left Mountain Hill. Now she was in Delmoor, her mother’s hometown.

After a short bath she stood in front of the mirror, applying the herb again. The mark had truly grown. Last week it had been nothing more than a circular sigil on her left shoulder blade. Now, intricate lines branched downwards along her spine, winding like roots or veins beneath her skin. The lines were

darker and more defined, almost like letters. Her fingers traced the lines as she applied the herb, the subtle throbbing pulsing beneath her touch.

Four years and one month. That was all she had left. Maybe less now, with how fast it was spreading. She tried to be optimistic. She had to be. For two years nobody ever came forward to say they wanted to study the mark. Malek had studied this case, her possession. She wasn’t dying. Not today.

The kitchen smelled faintly of freshly made pancakes and a hint of coffee which made her stomach growl in anticipation. A girl, probably her age, was setting the table. Her hair was short, dark

dense hair that seemed to coil at the end. She must be Malek’s daughter. When they arrived yesterday, she had already gone to bed.

Her face lit up when Amari walked in, eyes bright with the kind of energy Amari remembered from a life that felt distant now.

“You must be Amari Brown.” The girl’s smile was genuine. “I’m Eira. Breakfast is ready, come on and sit.”

Amari sat in the chair Eira pulled out for her. “Thank you,” she murmured.

“Aunt Suzan said not to wait for her. She went to meet with my father in his covenstead.”

Amari nodded as she began to eat. She should probably say something. Ask about Delmoor, or the house, or…something.

Riley would know what to say. He always knew how to fill silences. But the words stuck in her throat, so she focused on her plate instead.

“So, Dad says you’re still in university.” Eira spoke as she sat across from Amari.

“Mh. I’m in my last year of nursing.”

“That’s brilliant. Are you doing your practical hours here in Delmoor?”

“Yes. I requested placement here.”

Eira’s smile widened. “That means you’ll be staying for about a month. I’m glad.”

Amari wanted to return the enthusiasm, to say something warm, but her mind went blank. She settled for a small nod and kept eating.

Eira’s smiles didn’t falter. “I’m in third year, Department of Psychology. So I suppose that makes me younger than you.” She chuckled, then glanced at Amari’s plate…or rather, at the three empty plates stacked beside it. “You like food?”

Amari felt heat creep up her neck. “Sorry, I—”

“No, no! Here, have mine. I wasn’t very hungry anyway.” Eira slid her plate across the table, grinning. “I’ll clear the dishes.”

Amari smiled, genuinely this time, and continued eating. At least her appetite didn’t require conversation.

“Let’s go then,” Eira said once they’d finished cleaning up.

She led Amari down the hallway. They stopped before a wooden door. Thin that Amari could hear whispers from inside. Eira knocked.

“Father, we’re here.”

A voice answered from inside, low and measured “Come on in.”

Eira pushed the door open. The room revealed itself

in layers. It resembled a study. Books scattered everywhere, stacked on tables, crammed into shelves that reached from floor to ceiling. A large desk stood at the centre, its surface buried under

scattered papers and open grimoires. Candles burned in holders made from what looked suspiciously like human bone, their flames casting long shadows across the walls.

She noticed Suzan wasn’t here. Two men stood near the desk, deep in conversation. The first was Malek, clearer now than in last night’s dim light. A middle-aged man with broad shoulders and eyes that held the weight of too much knowledge. Dark

circles shadowed his eyes, as if he hadn’t slept all night. He wore simple clothes, but the way he stood spoke of many years of experience. The air around him felt heavier. Charged.

The second man was younger. Or he appeared so. Amari couldn’t say why that distinction mattered, but only that it did. He leaned against the desk, speaking to Malek in a voice that was too low for Amari to catch. He was tall and lean, dressed in

black that made him look like a shadow given form. When he shifted his weight, his movements were fluid in a way that spoke of age. Centuries maybe, compressed into a body that looked no older than twenty-five.

Amari stared. She couldn’t help it. There was something about him that demanded attention, that made the mark on her back pulse with sudden, fierce heat. Not pain this time, it was almost like recognition.

“Who is he?” Amari whispered to Eira.

Before Eira could answer, the man turned. His eyes found Amari across the room as she stood by the door. A wave of scent hit her, petrichor and cedar, rain-soaked earth and dry wood. It flooded the room, filled her lungs. The mark pulsed in response. Her nape began to throb, a faint echo beneath her skull. Her hand unconsciously reached for the spot

before looking at the man again.

Why did he smell so good? Why was her body reacting like this? For a moment, his expression was unreadable, handsome in a sharp-edged way but blank. His eyes were hazel, shot through with amber. Then something shifted. First his brows

drew together, a crease forming between them. Then his eyes widened slightly, as if he’d seen something impossible. Then they narrowed again, studying her with an intensity that made

her skin tingle. Her nape pulsed harder. Amari’s breath caught in her throat. The man’s jaw tightened before he looked away, turning back to Malek with a curt nod.

“We’ll speak later.”

His voice was low, controlled, but there was an edge to it now. Something sharp and unknown. He moved towards the door where Amari stood frozen in place. As he passed, the scent grew stronger, cedar and rain clinging to his skin. Her nape throbbed once more, insistent. She couldn’t stop the small gasp that escaped her lips.

The man paused. Just for a moment. From the corner of her eye, she saw his head turn, his gaze flicker to her once more. His expression was strange. Something primal and intense lay in his eyes, mixed with confusion. Then he was gone, footsteps fading down the hallway.

Amari stood there, shaking hand pressed to her chest where her heart pounded. Her nape continued to pulse, warm and insistent, as if trying to tell her something she had no words for. That had never happened before. Suzan walked in after him.

“That,” Eira said quietly, “was Kael Varin.”

Before Amari could ask what that meant, Malek stepped forward, his face full of concern. “Suzan, Amari. Forgive me, Kael’s visit was unexpected.” He glanced at the door, then back to them. “I hope your first night in Delmoor wasn’t unpleasant.”

“No, it was fine.” Amari approached him, extending her arm.

“That’s good. Come sit, let me see the mark.”

Malek gestured for Amari to sit, facing away from him. She felt his hand on the back of her head, warm and steady. He began to chant in an unfamiliar language though she recognized the cadence. Many witches they’d visited spoke in the same manner,

before sighing in defeat, unable to see beyond the mark.

The syllables made the candle flames flicker and dance. She felt a force press against her mind like a hand pushing through a locked door. But the door in her mind refused to open. Malek tried again, the chanting growing more forceful. Amari felt pressure building behind her eyes, a dull ache spreading through her skull. Still, something held firm inside her, like a wall between her consciousness and his magic. Or maybe there was nothing left inside to find. Maybe she was already becoming the nothing she feared.

“Malek, I think we should stop.” Suzan’s voice cut through the chaos as books tumbled from the shelves.

Another presence filled the room, preventing Malek from succeeding in his invasion. The candles melted faster, wax dripping like water, flames sparking like fireworks. Amari’s spine arched. Copper flooded her mouth. Warmth trickled from her nose, then her ears. Blood. She realised distantly, as Suzan’s sharp inhale confirmed it.

Malek stopped, his hands retreating. “I can’t enter,” he said, and there was genuine surprise in his voice. “Something is blocking me. Something powerful.”

Suzan stood from where she’d been watching, her face drawn with worry. She pressed a cloth to Amari’s nose. “Isn’t there anything else you can do? If you can’t—”

“I know.” Malek moved to his desk, rummaging through papers until he found what looked like a small leather journal, its pages brittle and yellowed with age. “I found some research on possession and carrier marks from the sixteenth century. Something about witches using children’s bodies to resurrect

themselves.. marking them was one way of claiming the vessel.” Malek placed the book before them. Amari and Suzan skimmed the pages.

Each mark listed its effects, possession date, and date of maturation. There wasn’t any case of one being cured, they all led to one outcome.

“We are already aware of the time on our hands, but I’m afraid with the rate it’s growing, it could be less.” Suzan said, looking at Malek.

“Oh. How much time do we have, to come up with a cure?” Suzan was unable to answer. Saying it out loud had always felt like putting a seal on the matter.

“Four years and one month,” Amari said. “Ten years from the day it attached itself to the day it consumes my body.” The room fell silent. She stated it clearly, the way she always did when asked the question. The answer was memorised from three years of counting down.

“Well, a cure is dependent on the amount of information we get about the origins of the mark. Four years isn’t enough time. The spirit possessing you is old, yes, but this…” Malek shook his

head. “This is different.”

Amari turned to face him, her hands trembling slightly. “What does that mean?”

“It means we try something else.” Malek returned to his desk, the journal closed in his hands. “I can seal the mark. That will slow its growth for maybe a couple of years. It will buy us more time to make the cure.”

More time. That was all she needed, all she’d ever wanted. Amari’s chest tightened, but not with fear. Hope. Actual hope, fragile and terrifying. She might see Riley graduate. She might finish her PhD. She might-

“Do it.” Suzan’s eyes flickered with the same desperate hope as she looked down at Amari.

“I will need to prepare for it. For now, let’s get rid of the smell coming from your shoulder blade. You see, Kael isn’t a rude person. It’s just that vampires are susceptible to Witches’ Hazel.” He walked towards her. “I will help dull the pain in the meantime.”

Amari’s eyes widened. Kael was a vampire. She’d met countless witches, but never any other supernatural creature. Suzan helped lift Amari’s shirt to reveal the mark. Malek

placed one hand on her back, directly over the mark. His other hand hovered in the air, as if to capture something unseen. Green light began to gather around the room.

“Kalimarae shiz’zor vathia.”

The mark pulsed faintly beneath her skin. The darker lines began losing color, sinking like water draining into sand. The burning sensation faded to a distant ache, the throbbing finally, mercifully, quiet.

“That should hold it for now.” Malek stepped back, returning to his desk.

A knock at the door interrupted him. “Father?” Eira poked her head in. “Sorry, but brother Kael

says I must summon you to the North Quarter. He says it’s urgent.”

Malek’s expression shifted, concern deepening into something darker. He glanced at Suzan, then Amari, then back to Eira. “Tell him I’ll be there shortly.”

He turned back to them, but his movements were quicker now, more tense. “I apologise, it seems I must rush again. You are welcome in this room, there are many books here related to possession. Perhaps you’ll find something useful.”

Malek gave a slight bow before walking to the door. Last night he’d left in the same rush after being summoned. But this felt different. The urgency in Eira’s voice, the way Malek’s jaw had tightened, something was wrong. Amari’s gaze drifted to the window. What was the North Quarter, and why did the name feel like trouble? Suzan left shortly after to unpack, murmuring something about getting settled. Amari stayed in the study, running her fingers along the spines of books whose titles she couldn’t read. Some were in English. Most weren’t.

She pulled one down, Carrier Marks and Blood Ties and was about to open it when the scent hit her again. Cedar and rain. Her head snapped up. The study window stood open, curtains shifting in the afternoon July breeze. The scent was coming from

outside. Faint, but unmistakable. Her nape began to pulse, that same strange throb from earlier. She shouldn’t follow it. She didn’t even know why she wanted to. But her feet were already moving.

Amari stepped out into the hallway, and moved towards the side door that led to the garden. The air was cooler here.

Afternoon light filtering through the trees. She followed the scent, her pulse quickening with each step, her nape growing warmer. And then she saw him. Kael stood near the edge of the garden, half-shadowed by an old oak tree. He wasn’t looking at her, not exactly. But she knew he’d been waiting.

“You came,” he said quietly, his voice closing the space between them.

Amari’s breath caught. “I-” The words died in her throat.

What could she say? That his scent had pulled her here like a thread? That her body had moved without permission? Kael’s gaze found hers and held, and for a moment, neither of them spoke. The air between them felt charged, electric, like

the moment before lightning strikes.

“You felt it too,” he said. Not a question. A statement.

Amari nodded slowly, her hand drifting to the back of her neck. “What was that?”

Kael’s jaw tightened. His eyes searched her face as if looking for an answer he didn’t want to find. “I don’t know,” he said finally.

But something flickered in his eyes, recognition, maybe, or fear. He knew more than he was saying.",2,1763113212.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

I recently ended a five-year engagement, but I didn’t leave voluntarily — my fiancé kicked me out after only three months of living together. I’m questioning if I overreacted, but I feel like the situation was extremely unfair.
We moved into a beautiful apartment and planned to set it up together. However, he insisted on involving mostly his family for painting and cleaning, barely coordinating with my family, even though my father offered to help if given notice. I asked him to include my mother, but he largely ignored it, and his sister publicly criticized my family for “not helping,” which was humiliating.
He often refused to help financially, even though he earns twice my salary. We split all bills 50/50, and he would spend money on coffee, cigarettes, and food for himself while refusing to contribute when I asked.
Even on my birthday. On that day, he chose to play Xbox with friends rather than celebrate together. I stayed with my family and went on a small cruise and then out at night. When I returned, he argued that I had spent all day out and treated my birthday sarcastically.
There were ongoing issues: he restricted my going outside, criticized our sex life, and failed to protect me when his uncle and family overstepped boundaries. For example, his uncle brought a neighbor over without my consent even thought my bf didnt want me to have her over his uncle brings her without our permition. Hr just knock her door tells her that he is my e fiances family and called for for vine. I hope everyone understand tje reasons a grown man you was her fathers age want to meet her. My reacion was to protect my space, and his family blamed me telling me that i should have greet him and sit with them.
Eventually, after an argument, he called me and told me our relationship was “ruining both our lives” and told me to take my things and leave. His family cut off contact and even implied that my friendship with the neighbor caused the breakup.
I feel hurt because I was blamed for things I didn’t do, treated unfairly, and kicked out instead of being supported or having a conversation. I loved him and wanted a life together, but I don’t think I was wrong to stand up for myself.
AITA for defending myself and not taking the blame for things I didn’t do?

I let a lot of red flags slip by and I became really passive and accepting basically shaping myself little by little to her needs. I would describe her attachment style as avoidant and me as a anxious attachment style. Anyways first year was okay we visited each other constantly but when she was on vacation and she went to my place she was relatively calm. But when she was working and I went over to her place in Japan (and even when she wasn't working) we always bumped heads since I was in HER personal space. It always wasn't good enough, my cleaning and she was uncomfortable as was I. After that. And during the first year she would question why she was in a lost distance relationship. She valued proximity and I couldn't move to Japan until 5 years until I was vested at my work. I tried getting a 7 on 7 days off job but wasn't successful and was devastated. Idk if we really understood each other as I had to ask a bunch of questions to get her to talk about herself. I like my partners to share about themselves, that's one of my love languages. She was getting exhausted because she was trying to explain things and felt like her point wasn't getting across. The way she phrased things was weird, she had a British English. Well like 10 months into the relationship we had a big fight and she was upset on how I handled it. She had been hesitant about the relationship prior a lot but this is the first time she wanted to break up.. she worked in the film industry so she had no time to have a serious relationship but long distance was perfect for her. Even tho she wanted the proximity. On a random short day she can meet her friends and her bf too. I basically kept the relationship alive each and every time she was thinking about it breaking up. So she was getting into the busy part of her project. She basically didn't want me to visit her while she was working. I insisted because my favorite band was playing in Tokyo. And she kind of said no and wanted to break up, then said okay you can go and I asked if I could stay with her and she had to think about it. Originally she was slightly not in favor of it and the more she thought that I thought i was entitled to stay with her in semi peak work hours she got upset. I compromised and said I would get a hotel near her. For two nights she let me stay at her place. She said I needed to think about the relationship and what I could do to change. So she said she would be give me my 2nd chance Fast forward to May. She had not scheduled a single visit to visit me sin almost more than 10 months ago. I was very frustrated when she said she made plans with her friends and I should have told her sooner to make plans with her. Mind you our last talk over phone or in person was in January. We were gonna talk  March/April but we both missed the time and never really rescheduled. I wanted to break up in frustration and then her dad passes away. I did what any bf would do. Be there but she was in shock..(later she criticized me for trying to be the perfect boyfriend to put on a show)

I always freeze in deaths of loved ones. I waited for her to reach out for me. I kept telling her I wanted to visit at the end of June for an event or I could visit her too.  She might have thought I wanted the event more. So she broke up and then started to vent about her Dad and situation. I couldn't dissociate the two things so I just panicked. Later on I still went to the event but just left gifts and flowers at her place. She was happy at the nice gesture but livid at the thought of me swinging by or attempting to swing by. In mid July she tried to hear me out when she was on vacation but she went really ballistic and one little thing after some seshes of talks made her not want to continue. She then told me something that opened a deep wound, that I couldn't seize the moment. That hurt since a lot of times in my life I've been really close to the goal and success and just fell short. I reacted and called her a bad person. She said her ex did the same thing. And also cheated on her and never apologized. She said she neesed more time one week after to see if she wanted to continue the relationship. During that time she blocked me on her phone and what's app but not on social media. That's when I did no contact for 5 weeks and then couldn't stand it and contactes her a week after my bday. Said I was 34 like when I met her(she was now 36). She just left me on read. She claims to have not blocked me but Im almost certain she did. I would send a message here or there and didn't realize the block happened until two weeks later. I thought she just muted me. Then I went on a bad frenzy 😔 

She  also waited until the nasty fight in July to tell me she wanted to take over her dad's humble coffee business. She waited 1.5yrs to tell me


I started emailing her all my previous' messages that I had sent. Maybe one every other day. In two different accounts. On Google messages. And nothing. Then I saw she blocked me on other things.. obviously I was suffocating but I was panicking cuz didn't know if she had moved on. Apparently it was her Dad's passing I later found out. But she just up and left no word. For 4 months. I sent a letter that I would be in her town for close to 2 weeks. Then no response. I left a package with gifts and same message.. nothing. I thought it was completely over and I was never going to Japan again. So I wanted a fairwell. One week before she broke with me I had a one night stand because I was so upset at everything, she didn't want to visit me, she didn't want to talk to me about her Dad and the most important thing I wanted to ask about the event again and I didn't think she would blow up like she said. So I told her in a letter as a final farewell and letter. I chased so much and she didn't make an effort to contact or see each in many months. So I wrote it. Dunno if that's the sole reason she replied, cuz her ego was hurt but then I retracted everything and told her it was to get her attention. She said the relationship flourished because I kept it alive she also said she didn't that feel bad and that I should have known and waited for her but she had not told me anything about healing .she just up and left..and she said she never wanted to see me again. After the retract, she said she lost trust.. that I broke her boundaries and that I disturbed her peace. And that the reason she broke up with me was because she needed peace in her mind and clarity and I wasnt providing any of that. 

Did I mess up by telling her the cheating part? I felt horrible, but I owned up to it. It wasn't right, I completely regret it but now it's done and I can't go back..did I ever have a chance? Or to win her back in retrospect? Or was this doomed from the start. Now when I go to Tokyo I'll always think of her. I'm always fixated on her body type as it's not common and she fit my ideal girl language and type standards. Im still incredibly sad.. I would have continued but with all of this it seemed hard. I think I was just so fixated on the physical, that our connection never really got there. Idk maybe we wee incompatible. Ty for reading, cheers-",1,1763112738.0,BreakUps30Plus,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1: The Marriage Deal

Matthew Langford, a man in his thirties, carried a raw and unfiltered desire that was almost palpable.

Adriana Xander had lost count of how long he had been relentless. Her body felt as if it were unraveling, overwhelmed by a lust so fierce it left her gasping for air.

Matthew knew every inch of her intimately, his touch precise and deliberate. Not a single caress was wasted; his movements were smooth, practiced, and sure.

“Clear my schedule starting tomorrow. I’m taking the week off. Book two tickets to Neocoralis,” Matthew declared as he finally pulled away, standing beside the bed while slowly dressing.

Adriana shifted her aching waist, a spark lighting her tired eyes. “You’re taking me on vacation, Matthew?”

He paused, a slight frown crossing his face as he looked down at her. “I’m going with Natasha.”

Her smile faltered instantly, replaced by an awkward lowering of her gaze. “Okay, Mr. Langford…” she murmured, the words tasting bitter.

Noticing the sudden paleness that crept over her face, Matthew’s tone softened slightly. “Adriana, you’re just an orphan. You’re young. I can’t marry you.”

She met his eyes, forcing a tight, bitter smile. “I never expected you to marry me. But now that Ms. Jones is divorced and back, should we end this… affair?”

Matthew’s expression darkened. He reached out to gently rub her head in an attempt to soothe her, then placed a card on the nightstand. “Be good. Buy whatever you want.”

“Mr. Langford, I don’t want to be a mistress,” Adriana said stubbornly, her gaze unwavering. She knew deep down he would eventually marry Natasha Jones.

“You’re jumping ahead. We’ll deal with that when the time comes. Don’t throw tantrums. Whether this ends or not isn’t up to you.” Growing impatient, Matthew glanced at her one last time before leaving.

As the door clicked shut behind him, Adriana’s ears rang with silence. The world around her seemed to fade away.

Adriana was an orphan. During her freshman year, her appearance had drawn the cruel wrath of Mia Langford, a wealthy girl whose bullying left Adriana deaf in one ear, with a crushed pinky toe, and almost blinded by a cigarette burn.

Someone had recorded the abuse and posted it online, sparking a scandal that engulfed the school.

The administration summoned the parents. Representing Mia was Matthew—her brother.

Perhaps to protect the Langford Group’s reputation, or maybe out of pity, Matthew reached out to the battered Adriana. The first words he spoke to her were, “Don’t be scared. I won’t let anyone hurt you again.”

Spineless. Pathetic.

Adriana had fallen for him. At her most vulnerable, Matthew fed every fantasy she held about love and safety.

She once believed he was her salvation. But now… he didn’t love her. He only refused to let her go.

At the Langford Group.

\*\*\*

Matthew had a meeting to finalize his handover. Natasha waited patiently in his office.

Soon, they would be flying to Neocoralis together, ready to spend seven romantic days side by side.

Adriana set a cup of coffee in front of Natasha, her chest tightening as if it were being sliced open. “Ms. Jones, enjoy your coffee.”

Natasha glanced at her with a gentle smile.

She came from a privileged background, perfectly suited to Matthew. Childhood sweethearts, she exuded a refined, elegant aura. Born into wealth, she moved effortlessly with grace—just sitting there, her confidence burned into Adriana’s eyes.

Adriana knew she had lost. She never truly stood a chance.

A prince never really falls for a poor girl. He only uses her to pass the time.

Setting down the cup, Adriana practically fled the office.

Confidence deserted her. The label of orphan, the weight of poverty, the scars left by abuse—all screamed insecurity from every fiber of her being.

“Mr. Langford and Ms. Jones are going on their honeymoon? I heard they’re official now. Once they return, the engagement will be announced. Both families have already given their blessing,” coworkers whispered in the pantry.

As Adriana poured herself a cup of tea, the boiling water suddenly splashed onto her hand, turning her skin bright red.

The cup slipped from her grasp and shattered on the floor. Startled, she hurried to run her burn under cold water.

Matthew and Natasha were getting married.

That meant she and Matthew were finished. And so was her internship at the Langford Group.

“Adriana, Mr. Langford wants you to drive him and Ms. Jones to the airport at 11,” a coworker called out.

She forced a bitter smile. Matthew… was merciless.

She knew this was deliberate. There were drivers available, but he chose her—to remind her of her place, to crush any foolish hopes she might harbor.

In the end, both Matthew and Mia were bullies, just with different methods of breaking people.

One shattered her body. The other crushed her already broken heart.

Pulling out her phone, Adriana hesitated for a long moment before dialing a number she had once blocked.

“Hello, Mr. Lincoln. You once said… if I agreed to marry you, you’d sponsor my studies in Pastalia. Does that offer still stand?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

Marriage might be her only escape from Haldoria, and the only way to break free from Matthew.

“Think it through,” the man’s deep voice replied. “Come to Clarke Residence on the 13th at 7 p.m. We’ll discuss the details.”",1,1763112663.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

After 13 days in Lucknow's food coma, we decided to escape to the mountains. 



We prefer slow travel whenever possible, so here, we took 2 stops before reaching Kasar Devi.



This thread about our 1st stop; finding peace away from the 'main' spots.



An overnight train whisked us to Kathgodam, the gateway to Uttarakhand. Our final goal was Kasar Devi, but we believe travel is in the pauses. So we intentionally slowed the pace and planned two stops.



This is a thread about the first stop, Bhimtal, which turned into a 4-day workation of mountain quiet, hidden trails, and the best apple pie we’ve ever had.



The Perfect Workation Lifestyle :)



We booked a cozy Airbnb high above the main town. The views were incredible, and it was perfectly set up for a slow-travel workation. 



Most days were a blissful routine: working from our quiet base, taking long morning and evening walks, and discovering sunrise and sunset spots in the forest with absolutely no crowd. It was pure solitude.



We'd sometimes cook our meals, listening to the sounds of the birds and our favorite music. But on one day, we decided to explore two truly offbeat places and they were amazing!



Ditching the Crowds for Clearest Lake!



Tired of the usual crowded tourist boat rides, we decided to explore a new lake. This led us to Garur Lake (part of Sattal), a local secret tucked within the forest and hills. The walk to the lake felt so enchanting!

And what we found shocked us: the water was the clearest we had ever seen in an Indian lake. 🤯



For a couple of hours, we sat by the shore as it grew dark, enjoying the view with literally no one else in sight. It was just us, the wind whistling through the forest, and the gentle sounds of nature. This is what slow travel is all about.



The Temple and Its Storytellers 😊



Our second offbeat find was a tiny, peaceful Hanuman Temple, recommended by a friend. It doesn’t attract big crowds, so it was incredibly serene. We stayed until the sunset, and the views were insane.



The priests were humble storytellers, sharing local tales and legends that made the visit feel deeply personal. A moment of true peace and insight away from the usual tourist chatter.



Our Favorite Cafe Anchor 😁



A good trip requires a great base and better food. Our cafe anchor in Bhimtal remains 'iHeart Cafe.' ❤️



We had visited this cafe multiple times in our ealier trips to Bhimtal as well and it still is our comfort place! 



We enjoy their coffee, steamed momos, pizza, and their legendary dessert: the epic Apple Pie with Vanilla Ice-cream and moist Lemon Cake. This place simply never disappoints.



The Culinary Neighbors!



The food scene around iHeart Cafe is strong!



☕️ Chai etc.: Right next door, serving amazing local tea and the perfect fluffy Bun Makkhan. Don't skip it.



🍴 Let Me Dine: Across the street. We had decent pizza and tandoori fish. Service was slow, but the staff was courteous.



🌟 Zooby's: A fantastic find nearby! Excellent cold coffee, delicious Malai Kebabs, and perfectly done French Toast. A solid win.



Where To Next?



Four days of working, walking, clear-water discovery, and indulging in hill-station comfort food felt like a complete reset.We bid adieu to Bhimtal, knowing there are still a few more corners to explore next time. 



Our journey continued deeper into Uttarakhand, towards the next hidden gem before reaching Kasar Devi. (Stay tuned for the next stop!)",1,1763112644.0,DoBaniye,0,1.0,False

Podcast, coffee, tea, skincare – and 60 minutes of me-time in the bathroom: That's how Bill Kaulitz, (36) starts his days.



How much work is involved in looking like Bill Kaulitz? And what advice would he give his younger self? Here, the Tokio Hotel frontman reveals his beauty routine – from the $10,000 laser to the concealer he's been using for 21 years.




In the beauty series ""Face Time,"" celebrities write about their skincare routines, favorite products, and little vanities. This time, Bill Kaulitz, lead singer of Tokio Hotel, identical twin, podcast and Netflix star, gives us a sneak peek inside of his toiletry bag:


Favorite beauty ritual: ""That's putting on my makeup in the morning. I like to take 60 minutes for it – because I enjoy it. But first, I start with a really good skincare routine . I usually listen to a podcast while I do this, and then I get ready in peace and quiet, drink a coffee or tea, and apply my makeup.""



Biggest investment: “My most expensive beauty product is probably the Lyma laser, which I bought twelve months ago because it’s the current skincare trend right now, and everyone says you should invest in your skin for the long term. It’s the first home laser that you can use yourself. It cost over $10,000. But apparently, it’s the ultimate beauty tip for having beautiful skin for a very long time – without discoloration, with small pores, and a good firmness.”



All-time favorite: ""I've probably been using Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage the longest. It's absolutely the best concealer on the market. It simply has the perfect consistency, the perfect color – and it's almost always sold out. That's why I don't really want to reveal it, but it's truly my absolute secret weapon. I always have it with me in my bags, and I've been using it for at least 21 years.""



Looking in the mirror: ""When I look in the mirror, I see someone who is very, very, very satisfied with his life at the moment and is enjoying it to the fullest. Of course, there are wrinkles and dark circles under his eyes, but basically I see a Bill who is happy and has the most fun possible every day.""


Advice to my younger selves: ""Don't always be so vain. Imperfection and flaws is sometimes really beautiful and it can be totally exciting.""



Understanding of beauty: ""I believe true beauty comes from within and without. Of course, nothing makes you glow more than when you're happy – or newly in love. That's always how it is for me. When I'm in love and I have butterflies in my stomach, it's totally visible. You simply radiate from within. But all of that is pointless if you neglect your appearance. Therefore, you have to take good care of yourself, make sure you have good skin, eat and drink the right things, and simply take some preventative measures – and that can certainly include Botox.""



Most expensive skincare product: ""For my skincare routine, that means my moisturizer, my serum, my eye cream, my face wash, my toner. I have a ten-step routine for my skin and I use everything from Biologique Recherche. That's the reason why, for example, I never ever struggle with breakouts, even though I'm an 'greasy and oily guy'. That's the reason why I always have to use the right skincare; and that's where good makeup starts, too. That's what I spend almost all of my money on.""



Botox, Fillers & Co.: ""I think Botox and fillers haven't been a big deal for a long time, and they shouldn't be. I think everyone should do what makes them feel most comfortable. There are no lips that are too thin. There are no lips that are too full. You should do what makes you feel most beautiful. Anyone who still gets upset about Botox and fillers is, in my opinion, completely out of touch. It's fine not to do it, but getting worked up about it? That's completely unnecessary.""




Essential companions: “I never ever leave the house without lip balms – I’m absolutely obsessed and addicted to it, unfortunately. Not so much because I have dry lips, but because I love the feeling of having something oily on my lips. That’s why I have lip balms in every single handbag and pocket. My assistants always have lip balms with them too; even my security always has lip balms. This means that if one is ever missing or I’ve forgotten it, everyone knows: it’s an absolute emergency, and then everyone on my team is armed with it. But what I also never ever forget is my fragrance, ‘Himmel’ (Heaven). As a constant companion, I’ve now launched it in a travel size: ‘Himmel (Heaven) to go’ – exclusively at Sephora – which I can now take with me in my hand luggage on all my trips.”

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden.

The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

***“I’ll start after this email.”***

***“Okay, after this episode.”***

***“Fine, after lunch.”***

3 hours vanish and the task still isn’t started.

What finally broke it for me wasn’t another focus app. It was *movement*.

A peer-reviewed study of home treadmill-desk users reported **more focus, better mood, and improved task satisfaction**.

Not because they worked harder, but because they worked *differently*: moving while working. What walking-while-working feels like in practice:

* The “I’ll start later” feeling shrinks.
* Mental fog lifts faster than with coffee.
* Stress drops without a big willpower fight.
* Task initiation is easier. Momentum does the work.

**How I set it up (starter protocol):**

* Speed: **1.0–1.5 mph** (slow on purpose).
* Blocks: **10–20 minutes** of walking, then stand or sit.
* Cadence: Change position **every 30–60 minutes**.
* Tasks that pair well: email triage, reading, 1:1 calls, planning, outlining. (I pause the belt for precise typing bursts.)

**Why this helps procrastination (in plain English):**  
Movement kick-starts arousal/attention systems. That nudge is often enough to *begin*, and beginning is most of the battle.

**TL;DR:** Procrastination often melts when you add gentle motion. Slow treadmill walking at your desk kept accuracy intact, boosted focus/mood/satisfaction in users, and burns \~100 kcal/hour more than sitting. **Start tiny:** 10–20 min blocks at 1–1.5 mph, then alternate with standing/sitting.

What tasks do you find pair best with walking?

Here’s the thing: I don’t even own a car. I walk everywhere. But somehow both sides treat me like a double agent.

The Cones knock on my door three times a week:

“We saw you walk past their truck this morning. Did they say anything? Are they planning something?”

This morning, The Cones left a laminated “street map” of their idea of fair parking zones as a “peace offering.” I swear, if I burn it, I’ll finally feel free.

At this point, I’m seriously considering buying a cardboard car just to park across both of their houses not out of revenge, just to see the chaos unfold.",12,1763111291.0,neighborsfromhell,7,0.8,False

1owrjdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTicker/comments/1owrjdy/trump_readies_tariff_cuts_trade_deals_in/,"Trump Readies Tariff Cuts, Trade Deals in Affordability Push","Bloomberg) -- US President Donald Trump is readying substantial tariff cuts designed to address high food prices and a series of new trade deals — including framework agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador — as he seeks to address voter concerns over the cost of goods.

The push comes after electoral victories for Democrats last week across a number of key state and local races where candidates stressed affordability concerns. Trade deals with Latin American countries unveiled Thursday will see the US reduce tariffs and barriers on common grocery items like beef, bananas, and coffee beans in a push to lower grocery bills that have for years frustrated Americans.

Separately, Trump and other senior administration officials have previewed broader tariff exemptions that could cut levies on popular food products across the board. In interviews earlier this week on Fox News, Trump pledged to “lower some tariffs” on coffee while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested fruit imports would receive a break.


“One of the things that people have been talking about, just the last few days, is, you know, thinking about changing tariffs for foodstuffs,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Wednesday in an interview with Bloomberg host and Carlyle Group co-founder and co-Chairman David Rubenstein at an Economic Club of Washington event. 

The New York Times reported Thursday that Trump was preparing changes to reciprocal tariffs expected to include carve-outs for beef and citrus products, and extend beyond a previous executive order in which the president tasked administration officials with identifying foodstuffs that were not grown in the US for exemptions. 

“The Trump administration is committed to pursuing a nimble, nuanced, and multi-faceted strategy on trade and tariffs,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. 

Desai said possible changes would flow from both products identified by the president’s executive orders, and “trade deals being inked with some of our biggest allies in the Western hemisphere.”

The most significant of the deals announced Thursday was likely an agreement with Argentina, offering the latest boost from Washington for President Javier Milei as he attempts to open up one of the world’s most protectionist economies.

“The countries will open their markets to each other on key products,” according to a White House statement that said Argentina would provide “preferential market access for US goods exports” including certain medicines, chemicals, machinery, information technology products and medical devices.

The deals announced with Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador focused on reducing tariffs on key exports like bananas and coffee beans that are largely not produced in the US. 

The framework agreements will be completed in around two weeks and are expected to exempt specific products rather than reduce existing reciprocal tariffs, according to a senior Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House expects retailers and wholesalers to pass along any benefits to American consumers, the official added.

The administration official also indicated progress in an ongoing trade negotiation with Switzerland that could reduce tariffs on goods such as watches and chocolate.

The broad effort could help Trump as he attempts to reverse perceptions that he’s neglected addressing high costs that continue to anger Americans. As he signed legislation reopening the federal government on Wednesday, Trump said he would continue his work to “lower the cost of living, restore public safety, grow our economy, and make America affordable again for all Americans.”

Still, by removing tariffs Trump himself imposed earlier this year, he is simply resetting import taxes back to where they were before he took office. The administration claims that lower trade barriers in Latin American countries will boost US businesses, though the nations who secured framework agreements on Thursday have much smaller trade flows with Washington than many other economies do.

The Argentina deal provides a boost for Milei, an ideological ally, who had set a goal this year of reaching a trade agreement with the US.

The framework for the Argentina agreement comes after the Trump administration’s sweeping rescue package last month amid a market selloff. The US rushed to provide $20 billion in financing and directly purchased pesos in a bid to stem a currency selloff and help Milei’s party pull off a major comeback in midterm elections.

At the same time, opening up Argentina’s fragile economy will likely be met with some resistance as many domestic industries are not competitive at a global level due to high costs and tax burdens. 

For its part, the US will also remove “reciprocal tariffs on certain unavailable natural resources and non-patented articles for use in pharmaceutical applications,” according to the White House. 

Beef Trade

Argentina and the US have also “committed to improved, reciprocal, bilateral market access conditions for trade in beef.” The moves to ease trade in cattle come as Trump looks to provide relief to American consumers from beef prices that have surged in recent years.

Yet Trump’s efforts on beef have drawn fierce criticism from ranchers — a sector that has largely backed the president. After he previously announced plans to import more beef from Argentina, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said any increased imports would undercut US producers. The administration has worked to placate ranchers with a program to boost domestic beef production that includes more grazing on federal lands.

The US shipped $2.6 million worth of beef and pork products to Argentina in 2024, according to US Department of Agriculture data. Argentina’s government had blocked imports of US poultry products due to concerns with the avian influenza, according to the International Trade Administration. The disease has continued to affect US farms since 2022 and decimated bird flocks earlier this year.

While the full size and scope of the looming agreement isn’t finalized, Argentina can’t obtain a very broad agreement with the US because it is part of the South American trade bloc Mercosur, which prohibits members from negotiating large agreements outside the bloc. However, Mercosur countries earlier this year granted each member the ability to choose up to 50 products that could be negotiated outside the bloc and be free of its common external tariffs.",2,1763110805.0,TheTicker,1,1.0,False

1owrgsj,https://i.redd.it/tsslteo4k61g1.jpeg,"NDA wins big in Bihar. Now who is more far away from reality, Mapras or Rahul?","As the Bihar election results reach the final stage, it is very clear that the BJP JDU   alliance will  will win the election with a margin bigger than what any exit poll predicted. RJD and Congress are going to face one of the biggest setbacks in their history.

In the wake of this result, what needs to be discussed is how Rahul Gandhi has been dealing with elections and election results since the 2024 Lok Sabha election. This is the first major election after his vote chori allegations. If he truly respects democracy, then this result is a clear message to him from the people of India.

Now you know that Rahul Gandhi’s so-called enlightenment about vote chori came months before the Bihar election dates were even announced. While the election preparations and campaigning were happening in full swing, he was travelling across India giving presentations about vote chori in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Haryana.

A major question raised at that time was whether he was satisfied with the voting process in Bihar. If he genuinely wanted to ensure that the Bihar election had no discrepancies in the voters list, this was the perfect opportunity. His party workers were on the ground. RJD was strong in the field. They could have scrutinized the voters list booth by booth and fixed any issues easily. If his allegations had even a bit of genuineness, this is exactly what he should have done.

But now the election is over. Congress under Rahul Gandhi has faced a humiliating defeat. And I will not be surprised if he soon comes out claiming that vote chori happened in Bihar. As usual, the Congress-supporting media will immediately turn it into a headline. And anyone who questions it will be labelled Godi media.

But what is the reality? If there was any chance of vote chori or any need for vote chori prevention, he should have raised it during the Bihar election itself. Now that the election is over and he is defeated, if he suddenly claims vote chori, it only proves one thing  his credibility is in ruins and his allegations carry even less truth than before.

It is not only his own credibility that is at stake. He is pulling down the morale and trust level of the entire opposition. The Bihar result will now place a big question mark in front of the INDI Alliance. It will be interesting to see how TMC, RJD and NCP, the major allies of Congress, respond to both the result and the aftermath. Even if they openly demand replacing the opposition leader and removing Rahul Gandhi from the main stage, it will not be a surprise.

Back in Kerala , the medias have once again made a troll show out of this election and its result which will rule our social media for a couple of days now . From the campaign stage itself, they were narrating fairy tales about how Rahul Gandhi was creating a massive impact and how RJD was going to win. And now, in a 243 seat assembly, Congress managing only to win four seats ,that is barely about two percent of the total seats. Yet the Kerala Mapras spent hours glorifying Rahul Gandhi’s “phenomenal” campaign performance.

This clearly shows what many Malayalees are missing. There is a huge disconnect between the highly politicized media in Kerala and the political reality of India.

Note :  I know this post will be  downvoted in this sub, and that’s fine.. that’s exactly what I want. I want to hold up a mirror and show you what this place is , an echo chamber where the same lies are told, liked, and repeated, and where members  take comfort in those lies. Step out.

Two years ago, my partner and I purchased land in a rural area to self build an off-grid permaculture homestead. He suffers from two chronic diseases (Crohn’s and burning feet syndrome), and this lifestyle change is important to his health and our family's future.

The forest we purchased is truly beautiful and rare; we have no intention of moving elsewhere. Since moving in, we have been experiencing vague harassment, and damages and misplaced items. It was subtle at first that we thought nothing of it. We slowly realised that these guys trespass onto our property every day and use our forest for their personal fun, including stealing and selling wood from our trees and night shooting (when my partner shouts for them to leave, they aim their shots in our direction).

Our driveway passes two houses. We share a property line with one of these houses, which essentially has visibility to look down at our open space compound. These neighbours include 20 year old twins, who have taken great personal offence to our presence. The rare times my partner is able to venture out into our forest, he has found multiple walk tracks too big to be an animal’s, that no doubt lead back to their property.

A good part of our forest is protected as priority vegetation. Over time, trees on our property between us and the neighbours within this priority area were pulled down, cut, uprooted. They now have clear visibility down into our place. They can see everything we are doing and wherever we are, all the while they live in the shadows above us. I have reported this to council today, we’ll see if they’ll do anything.

My partner has attempted to speak with them several times, but they avoid him at all costs; even sitting in their car and refusing to step out when he is out on the driveway. Only time someone came out for a chat was their mum and a live-in girlfriend, only to verbally abuse him and refuse responsibility for their pitbull while it was jumping on him to get to our dog on heat. (Mum has since moved out. Another neighbour told us she was vying for an excuse to leave her family because she couldn’t handle them anymore, and the sons and father have placed the blame on my partner.)

We have spent so much money on security and fixing damages they’ve made around the property and on our car. We can’t afford to move out, even if we wanted to.

A lot of the damages are done when we are asleep or out for groceries, and are amplified over time (i.e. fence, slices on clothes, seatbelts, tarps, plastic). We also believe they piss on the fence and on trees in blind spots within the compound (identified by spots of yellow, dead grass).

We have multiple cameras around the compound. Twice we've attached an action camera on our Maremma, and they manage to unscrew it off his harness and delete any footage of them—who knows what else they’ve done to him. Anywhere the cameras don’t see, they attack. But even then, they seem to know when a camera isn’t working, particularly during foggy or rainy nights. We have low conviction they have a jammer because it’s hard to keep track of the many damages, since we sometimes move cameras around and put up new ones, sometimes we find damages in places in view of a camera, but it could have happened when it was a blind spot.

In the beginning, we had issues with their free roaming pitbull and unreasonable noise when they would throw raging parties until 3AM in the middle of the week. The noise has stopped, but they instead have put forth their energy into invading every aspect of our lives.

From watering down our generator fuel, to tampering with medication, food, toothbrush, action, secret and trail cameras, solar generator, BBQ, two cars (and rental cars). They've cut up guy ropes, every piece of clothing my partner owns, blankets and towels, and even littered used toilet paper around the outhouse area. They damaged two coffee machines, furniture, portable chargers and cables, garbage bags. They’ve cut up my partner’s driver’s licence and left the pieces in our mailbox. Our mail is being cut into and at times completely opened and contents taken out. We’ve heard fake animal sounds and clapping when we go to bed, to bathe, are putting up/adjusting cameras. They’ve stolen our compost green bags (thrown and littered into our forest on one of the walking tracks that lead back to their property), my credit card twice, knives and machetes, and random tools, ropes, wires and tape.

Some things they’ve stolen are eventually returned, sometimes damaged and/or mouldy. With wires and cable zip ties, they appear in the shape of an “L” (an MO of theirs, likely calling us losers—I slipped up a muddy hill one night chasing after my angry Maremma and the next morning I found a cable zip tie-shaped “L” in the same spot). We find these markings everywhere; carved in dirt, sliced in clothing and on camping table tops, even in the leaf of a succulent plant and pieces of wood.

My partner spent most of last year building a fence around the compound (roughly 1 1/2 acres), which they systematically cut at heights where the dogs can push out, and it's caused knock-on effects.

Our Belgian Shepherd/German Shepherd has wanderlust. She’s very loving and not at all aggressive but has a high prey drive. The few times when my partner couldn’t catch her in time, she roamed to another neighbour’s to chase his chickens, who has recently framed her for the death of two chickens (no evidence of her killing them, yet we are fined $400; we are in the process seeking court decision for this since the council has ignored the fact that there’s no proof she did it).

In December 2023, around the time the mum moved out, on two occasions, my partner came back from the shops to find our dog had been injured. A swollen eye, and a bruised rib to the point where she didn’t eat for days. We didn’t know what had happened; if our neighbour was sick enough to do this to an animal.

One of the twins doesn't seem to work and has a lot of time on his hands. He also seems to have a weird obsession with my partner. One morning, my partner said his yogurt tasted like semen. The other day, he went to the toilet and left the laptop on; he came back to see a YouTube tab open to a song titled 'I Got U' by Duke Dumont. Every single pair of his underwear has “L” shaped slices and extensive rips. There are some pairs with specific slices in the butt area. I've gotten bits of information on this guy from when I first met him and what I've found online. He seems immature and mentally unwell, and his actions speak of a disturbed psychopath fixated on hunting and toying with a prey that he believes took everything he wanted in life.

Council was eventually informed about what's been going on, including an attack on our Maremma when he was 9 months old and chased after them through our forest. He had dog bites all over him and an infection on his front leg. The council wrote back that this was a police matter, and they weren’t going to do anything about the dog attack because they wanted to remain impartial since we “didn’t have control over him.”

Over the last seven months, police were involved and called down a dozen times, but they have been ultimately useless and discriminatory against my partner (we purchased RTI on police reports as part of the restraint order case and one of their reports described him as “Suspected mental health, erratic, hearing/seeing things that arent there”). He's told them he has actually seen and heard them running back to their property on a few occasions.

We each went down to the station two different times to make a statement. The constable who took my statement basically told me to move, and made me feel like I didn’t belong here and wasn’t worth helping. My partner was basically interrogated with questions about how he knew this and that. We don’t call police every time, understanding that comparatively, we are low priority, but there has been no real investigation, just a bunch of excuses. We’ve jumped through so many red tape with zero help and results.

One night, we heard a motorbike start from the neighbours, which rode around in our forest and fired 10 gunshots around us. The first two shots were within two hundred metres of us that I felt the reverberation in my chest and down to my feet. They were so loud the 000 call operator said she heard it. Seconds before police came down to chat to them, the motorbike was on its way back to the neighbours but there was a phone ringing, and it changed direction and drove out through another neighbour’s property. We were told everyone in the house was accounted for. The motorbike came back the next morning. Nothing came of it.

Police also advised us to file a restraint order and provided us with incorrect names. The whole court process was stressful and, we learned, ultimately unhelpful—even with the restraint orders, the police still need footage of the people to enforce the order. How are we to capture footage when they effectively avoid and tamper with them? We really only have pictures of damages after the fact and footage that have sections deleted and movement of hidden cameras by an unknown, off-screen entity.

Our two dogs recently had puppies. The neighbours broke in a few times, rifled through our things (including manuals of our new cameras), ripped through food in the esky, sliced through laundry again, and switched the collars on the puppies.

While we intend to eventually sustain ourselves financially via production on the land, my partner lives here alone for ten months of the year, as we currently rely on my job to finance us, which unfortunately has me stuck in Sydney. With a baby on the way, we’re at a loss of what to do now that the institutions that are supposed to be helping “keep the peace” have done nothing but contribute to our emotional and psychological damages, and time loss of work.

Legal Aid advised us to sue the neighbours for damages, but after all the times we’ve reached out for help and got nothing back, I’m not sure anything will come out of this either. We’ve also considered approaching the media.

What else can we do?

TL;DR

* for two years, our neighbours (20 year old twins, a girlfriend and their dad; mum moved out, apparently our fault) constantly terrorise us, and steal and destroy our trees and material items, whilst avoiding and tampering with our cameras; one doesn’t work, is weirdly obsessed with my partner and leaves behind “L” shaped markings
* trees between us missing; they have clear views into our property from theirs
* clear human-sized walking tracks from our property, through our forest and into their property
* police and council have done nothing, even with my partner seeing and hearing them, and indirect knife and gunshot threats, restraint order is useless
* we suspect past physical abuse to our two dogs, and current and constant attempts to cause harm via compromising fence
* moving out is not an option; living here is for my partner’s health and our future
* we have puppies, I am pregnant, we are single income, and long distance for ten months of the year
* possible next course of action: suing them for damages, possibly reaching out to media",2,1763109969.0,AusLegal,41,0.67,False

1owr2gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1owr2gg/aita_for_not_leaving_the_restaurant_after_id/,"AITA for not leaving the restaurant after I’d already arrived, even though my friend had an injured toe?","I want to begin by apologising for this extremely long post. I (38F) had loosely made plans to meet my friend (48F). She was going to be in the vicinity of my workplace, and since we hadn’t seen each other since her birthday a couple of months ago, I suggested we catch up for a quick coffee before her dinner with another friend (whom I didn’t know). Our plan wasn’t confirmed until she messaged me around 5:30 PM asking, “Where are we meeting?” and requested that we pick somewhere close to her dinner location. She also mentioned that her toe (she had an abscess that was acting up) was bothering her, so she didn’t want to walk too much.

For context: I had only recently started working in the area and wasn’t fully reacquainted with the neighbourhood. I suggested the only place I knew near her dinner venue (let’s call the café Song). She asked if it was still open, and since Uber Eats showed it as open, I said, “I believe so.” She agreed and said she would update her Uber destination to Song.

As I approached the café, I realised that Song had moved locations; it had shifted about five minutes away from its original spot. As soon as I noticed, I called her to let her know. She didn’t answer (she was on another call), so I also texted her the updated location immediately.

I reached Song, got a table, and messaged her that I was already seated.

Because she hadn’t changed her Uber destination, she arrived at the old location. From there, it was about a five-minute walk to the new one. Meanwhile, she had also left something behind in the Uber and needed to call the driver to reroute and return her pouch. In the midst of all of this, it began to pour (unexpected November rains) and already flustered, she called me, yelled, and asked me to come to her instead. I didn’t have an umbrella, nor was I wearing rain-appropriate footwear, and it was a full-on downpour. So instead of reacting impulsively, I took a few minutes to calm down. I was about to agree to switching restaurants when she texted saying she was on her way to me.

I thought, “Okay, cool. That settles it.” Boy, was I wrong.

I had shared my live location with her, so she could see how close the café was. But instead of checking the map, she took a wrong turn and walked around the block, which made her walk much longer. When she eventually reached (about 30 minutes later) she was annoyed and in a mood. After she cooled off, we did have a pleasant catch-up, and I assumed that was the end of it.

A couple of days later, she messaged saying she was extremely upset with my behaviour when we last met (this random coffee plan). She said that by staying at Song instead of leaving to meet her elsewhere, I prioritised my “comfort” over her pain. She said the walk made her toe bleed and triggered fears about infection, medical expenses, and the fact that she lived alone in a house with stairs, and no help. She also dismissed my explanations as irrelevant and said I “never” consider her needs.

During the course of this conversation, however, I had taken time to clarify that:
1.	Our plan was never confirmed until the last minute.
2.	She said she’d update her Uber destination but didn’t.
3.	She didn’t answer when I called to update her about the new location.
4.	By the time she suggested another place, I was already seated at Song.
5.	And that her wrong turn (not the actual distance from the original spot to the new spot) caused the extra walking.

I wasn’t making excuses; I was giving her the context from my perspective and stating only the factual chain of events, and I apologised for the unintended impact. But the exchange became emotional, and I eventually told her she “needed to stop making this a big deal and stop playing the victim.”

She replied sarcastically that the whole situation “just boils down to her not changing the destination to Song.” She ended by saying she needed to put herself first. I told her she should always put herself first.

I genuinely didn’t mean to hurt her. I didn’t knowingly ignore her pain. Most of this situation stemmed from miscommunication, timing issues, her not updating the Uber address, and her missing my update about the new location.

But now, she’s blocked me everywhere (iMessage, WhatsApp, calls, social media, and even my dog’s instagram account) without any further conversation. To be honest, she’s done similar things before (not blocking, but ghosting). She forgets how she tends to behave and then expects everyone to accommodate her, despite her inability to manage her emotions. Her mood swings have given me whiplash more times than I can count. And since she blocked me without even a warning, I’ve decided that I’m done coddling or entertaining her. I don’t want to leave the door open if or when she decides she’s ready to forgive me for “hurting” her.

I've been having AWFUL reactions to progesterone (100mg). I started it HRT 2 nights ago. The first night I took it and I felt shaky and jittery all night long and couldn't sleep at all. My doctor told me to try taking it in the morning, so today I did, and I felt just as awful all day long. It felt like I started my day with 20 cups of coffee. Jittery and anxious and shaky all day long. Several of my clients asked me why I was talking so fast. 😂

My doctor mentioned that we can go down to a lower dose from a compounding pharmacy and work our way back up to 100mg, so I think we're going to do that. But if she puts the order in today (and she may not even get back to me until Monday so the order may not be put in until then), that will get me the progesterone by Monday at the earliest, maybe not until mid-week next week. 

So my question is this: I know I need the progesterone to balance the estrogen patch, but would it be ok to keep the estrogen patch on for 4-6 days and not take the progesterone? I really can't take one more day of feeling like I'm on amphetamines. I'd rather take the estrogen patch off and re-start everything when I have the progesterone, but ideally I'd like to keep the estrogen patch on. 

And second question: Has anyone had a reaction like I have to progesterone and then been able to get used to it and tolerate it?",1,1763108914.0,Menopause,1,1.0,False

7-step guide to making sure your job NEVER gets done before Christmas:

1. Call us at the last minute.

Ring up on Dec 20th and say:  
I was gonna call you months ago, but I got busy.  
Yeah mate, so did we — that’s how calendars work.

2. Book a time… then don’t be home.

We LOVE standing outside your house like we're casing the joint.  
Real professional vibes.

3. Drop a ‘quick little job’ on us.

“While you’re here, can you just do this one tiny thing?”  
If it starts with “just”, it’s NOT tiny.  
If it ends with “should only take five minutes,” you’re lying.

4. Offer your driveway… then treat us like valet parking.

Move forward. Move back. Move to the left.  
Mate, I came to fix your pipes, not audition for Fast & Furious: Suburban Drift.

5. No bathroom, no water.

But sure — let me crawl under your house dehydrated, busting for a piss, like a sewer goblin who doesn’t deserve basic human rights.  
Cheers for that.

6. Argue the bill.

Say things like:  
“Mate, I didn’t think it would cost that much.”  
Neither did I — until I met you.

And then the classic:  
“I’ll pay you when my bonus comes in.”  
Sweet as, I’ll just tell my power company the same thing.

Maybe it is in other places, but it’s definitely not where I’m from.

I’m tired of the idea that men have to make the first move. Most of the time, I don’t even like a girl the first time I meet her. I’m not wired that way. By the time I actually realize I like someone, it already feels “too late” to ask her out.

Take one experience from college. I was pretty close with this girl, G. We became friends quickly at the start of the semester. She used to flirt with me a bit, but I didn’t think much of it—people joked around like that all the time. Three months later, we were grabbing coffee after class, waiting for our rides, when it suddenly hit me that I liked her. Half a week later, I finally worked up the courage to ask her out.

She told me, “I really liked you when we first met, but not anymore.”  
I asked her why she never asked me out back then. She said, “Guys are supposed to be the ones who ask.”

We’re still friends, but that moment stuck with me. Why is this expectation always placed on men? Why does the timing have to depend on who’s “allowed” to be the one to speak first?

My husband's been super busy with work, so I've been doing most errands solo with the baby. Grocery runs, quick coffee stops, just the usual stuff. Thought I'd share my take for anyone looking for something light but solid.

* Lightweight

It's seriously light. I can lift it in and out of the car one-handed while holding my baby. No struggling, no weird body twists in the parking lot lol. When you're already juggling a diaper bag, formula, and a half-asleep baby, that kind of ease makes a huge difference.

* Stable

The frame feels really solid. IDK much about materials, but my husband says carbon fiber is great since his Specialized bike uses it, so I just trust him lol. What I do notice is the day to day stuff. We've had a lot of wind where we live and it hasn't wobbled at all when I'm pushing it. The sidewalks in my neighborhood aren't great and it still feels steady going over the rough spots.

* One-hand fold

This is my favorite part. I can pop it open with one hand while holding my coffee, make sure it's steady, then grab my baby from the car seat. So easy. I've also folded it the same way when getting back to the car and it's never been a struggle. Click, done, no drama.

* Everyday use

Practical and thoughtful in design. The seat reclines enough to be comfy and our 1 yo has actually napped in it multiple times, so it's been working well for us. But I've seen a few people mention it's maybe not the best for babies under 6 months, just FYI. The canopy gives decent shade and helps with wind, and the basket underneath holds a few essentials when I'm out.

That's how it's been so far. I'll probably do another update once my baby's a bit older and we've used it more. For now, I'm just happy it makes my day a lot easier.",2,1763108643.0,Mamazing,0,1.0,False

Hey folks,

Just got done building a big Munich Travel Guide over on my site and thought I’d share the main tips and a sample 3–4 day plan here for anyone plotting a trip. Full guide with all the details, prices and sections is here:  
👉 [**https://thetraveltinker.com/travel-guide-germany/munich/**](https://thetraveltinker.com/travel-guide-germany/munich/)  
More guides and itineraries on [**TheTravelTinker.com**](http://TheTravelTinker.com) too.

# Why Munich is worth your time

Munich is perfect if you like:

* A walkable old town with proper “church bells and cobbles” energy
* Huge parks, river swims and beer gardens
* Big museums, palaces and an easy train link to the Alps
* Day trips that do not require a 5 am start and a nervous breakdown

It feels calm compared to some big European cities, but there is loads to do if you dig in a little.

# How many days in Munich?

Short answer:

* **3 days** for the main highlights
* **4 days** if you want a proper day trip like Neuschwanstein, Salzburg or Zugspitze

You can absolutely stay longer if you want to mix “sightseeing days” with “sit in a beer garden and eat pastry” days.

# Rough costs (very ballpark)

Per person, mid-range style:

* Daily spend: **€130–200** (\~£115–175 / \~$150–230)
* Coffee: **€3–4**
* Beer in a hall or garden: **€5–7**
* Casual lunch: **€10–15**
* Sit-down dinner: **€20–30**
* Major attraction (palace / big museum): **€15–20**
* Decent hotel for 2: **€130–200** a night

Cards work almost everywhere, but keep a bit of cash for markets and older places.

# Best areas to stay

Quick neighbourhood overview:

* **Altstadt-Lehel**: First-timer central. Close to Marienplatz, Viktualienmarkt, churches and the Residenz. Convenient and pretty, also pricey.
* **Maxvorstadt**: Museum land. Great cafés, galleries and student energy.
* **Schwabing**: Leafy, slightly artsy, close to the English Garden.
* **Glockenbachviertel / Isarvorstadt**: Trendy, LGBTQ+ friendly, loads of bars and independents.
* **Haidhausen**: Calmer, more local feel, nice for evenings.

If the centre is too expensive, pick somewhere a few stops from the old town on a direct U-Bahn or tram. Travel times are often 10–15 minutes and the vibe is less touristy.

# 3–4 day Munich itinerary idea

**Day 1 – Old town & first beer**

* Marienplatz and the Glockenspiel
* Viktualienmarkt for food + people-watching
* Climb St Peter’s Church tower for views
* Wander the Residenz or a couple of churches
* Dinner in a classic beer hall

**Day 2 – Palaces & parks**

* Morning at Nymphenburg Palace and gardens
* Head back into town and into the English Garden
* Watch the river surfers at the Eisbachwelle
* Beer garden dinner under the chestnut trees

**Day 3 – Museums or football & cars**

* Option A: Deutsches Museum, or a Pinakothek art day in Maxvorstadt
* Option B: Olympiapark, BMW Welt and Allianz Arena tour
* Evening in Schwabing or Glockenbachviertel

**Day 4 – Day trip**  
Pick one:

* **Neuschwanstein & Füssen** for fairy-tale castle views
* **Dachau Memorial** for a serious, reflective day
* **Tegernsee** for lake, boats and easy hiking
* **Zugspitze** for Germany’s highest peak and big views
* **Salzburg** for Mozart, pretty streets and mountain backdrop

Early trains help a lot with crowds and heat.

# Getting around

* Public transport is excellent: U-Bahn, S-Bahn, trams and buses on one system
* Zone M covers most tourist stuff
* Day tickets and group tickets often work out cheaper than lots of singles
* Central Munich is very walkable, you mainly need transport for Nymphenburg, Olympiapark, Allianz Arena etc
* Cycling is popular, there are plenty of rental options and bike lanes

Download a transport app, save your hotel and a few key stops, and you are basically sorted.

# Beer halls, beer gardens & food

Expect:

* Long wooden tables, loud chat and the odd brass band
* Half-litre steins of beer, Radler if you want something lighter
* Roast chicken, sausages, pork knuckle, dumplings, sauerkraut and big pretzels

Veggie and lighter options exist, especially in the trendier areas. In many beer gardens you can bring your own cold food as long as you buy drinks there, which is a nice little budget trick.

Tip: Around 5–10% tip is normal. Often people round up to a tidy number and tell the server the total they want to pay.

# Safety & general vibe

* Feels very safe for most travellers
* Usual pickpocket risk in busy spots, trains and at big events
* Oktoberfest and football days are more “loud and lively” than sketchy, but keep an eye on your stuff and your drinking

Use the same common sense you would in any major European city and you will probably be fine.

# Quick Q&As

**Q: How many days do I need?**  
A: Three full days for the city, four if you want a day trip.

**Q: Is Munich walkable?**  
A: Yes, most main sights are walkable from the old town, with transport for longer legs.

**Q: Best area to stay?**  
A: Altstadt-Lehel for first timers, Maxvorstadt or Schwabing for museums and cafés, Glockenbachviertel for nightlife.

**Q: Is Munich very expensive?**  
A: Prices are on the higher side for Germany, but you can keep things reasonable with markets, bakeries and smart transport tickets.

no i don't have romantic feelings for you.

my idea of love has always come from a good guy, or even a bad guy who becomes good for you.

someone who asks you out, takes you out on nice dates, holds your bag, buys you a pretty keychain.

plays the part of the perfect man.

but you aren't that.

you're the guy who hits me up one day before exam because both you and i know both of us are gonna fail.

you're the one who begs me for a dollar or two  just to buy a bag of chips, the one who blatantly steals the gifts other guys have given me and flexes them like it's your own.

you're the guy who looked at me too long when I didn't look at myself in the mirror.

the one i met a faithful summer day, too long ago to remember when.

you're the constant that has watched me date too many wrong people, the only contact that comes up when days become too heavy.

and no, we haven't been as close as we used to.

but we still always pick up where we left off, we're still 14 and barely managing existing, even tho we're adults now.

you're the only one who laughs at my cruelest jokes, who's as brain rotted as me, who still has that paper ring i made in grade 10 as a joke.

so no, you're not my idea of love. you're the only guy who makes me feel like my heart still beats.

with whom i don't have to play pretend, and act all pretty because you've seen my ugliest.

so no I'll never love you like i loved my exes, but I'll always choose you if you ever need me.

you'll always be too short for me.

so no we'll never be a couple, because fuck a label when the world stops becoming so cruel when you flash that cocky grin that makes your eyes disappear.

and i still have that marigold you plucked randomly and gave it to me 2 years ago, still have that pack of coffee you gave to me for absolutely no reason.

i still follow your ex and have that cringy ass post you made that you're too ashamed to acknowledge.

but you held your umbrella to my head because i was too lazy to get mine out the bag, you played along to make my ex jealous as i cried on your shoulder, you never hang up first no matter how annoyed you are, no matter how many times you say ""im playing with the boys right now."" you think of me when you see something you think  I'd like, and i,

i blurt out these words as i drown myself in the vodka you bought, because I'll always be a coward when sober when it comes to you.

so no i don't have romantic feelings for you, you short ass rodent.

i just hope you believe my words and not look at me too long again to know what a crude liar i am.

Normally I would be frustrated, scrolling through my phone in bed until a sensible hour. Instead I made coffee and went outside. It was still in the dark. Everyone else was asleep. No vehicles, no noise, just silence. We watched the sky gradually change hues. Heard birds begin to sing. Seen the air turn from cold to hot. Nothing to do, no phone, just be there. And then it hit me, that I am perpetually rushing to the next thing. The next task, the next notification, the next plan. Never just here. That morning was the first time I felt like I’d actually been there in months. I started setting my alarm for 5am on purpose. Not to be productive or accomplisht things. Just sit. Watch the world wake up. To realize that now, right this moment, is the only moment that really exists. Everything else is just noise.",3,1763108213.0,LivingTheDharma,0,1.0,False
