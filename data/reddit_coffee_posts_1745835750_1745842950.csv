Okay naman sya. We exchanged messages everyday. 1 week into talking, wala pa sya balak makipag meet pero lagi nya sinasabi magkikita din daw kami. Mind you hindi naman magkalayo yung city na tinitirhan namin parehas. 2 weeks in, finally nag decide na sya makipag kita. Pero dis oras ng gabi. Sa BGC daw kase he was there. Sabi ko hindi ako pwede. But then i initiated na magkita na lang kami around his place to walk around and have coffee. It was Sunday, 3am and nakauwi ako 5am na.

Then after that, everything went well naman. We still exchanged messages. In the middle of the week, we had a serious talk abt me not wanting to go to his place “yet” and be with him alone because that’s gonna make me uncomfy and i don’t wanna be in a situation na mawalan ako ng control sa ano man pwede mangyari. He took it in a negative way because before that convo, he assured me na kahit daw invite nya ako, he’ll respect my boundaries naman. He got cold feet the next day. Didn’t msg mo. So i iniated to see him and talk to him personally para explain side ko and what i really meant doon sa message ko. Kase alam ko iba yung naging dating sa kanya.

That day na he was being cold, i asked if we could meet personally so we could talk. He obliged so I travelled to his place, at 3am again (nakaidlip daw kase sya, we were supposed to meet midnight) on a Wednesday. We just roamed around outside and talked. Naintindihan naman nya finally yung ibig ko sabihin. After that 2nd meeting i went home. He told me we will go to a “proper date” this weekend. He started being extra sweet and all. Even told me na i have proved myself enough to be his girlfriend. Even asked me if i am willing to be his girlfriend soon. That kinda threw me off kase bakit parang ako yung dapat may iprove? Knowing na ako na nga nag initiate makita at makausap sya twice. At 3am pa!

After the conversation about me being his future girlfriend on Saturday, medyo nag stepped back muna ako para iobserved if ano magiging next move nya after i explained myself and how serious i am abt having a relationship. Weekend went by and the promised date didn’t even happen. I was waiting for him to prove me something that he is also serious. But nothing. I didn’t questioned him. I just kept myself distanced.

Today he confroted me about instantly losing interest. Why did i became so cold after just a day. I explained to him everything yet he said i could’ve waited for days for him to take me out. And sabi ko din na i cannot waste more time waiting for someone who seems not putting efforts to see me. Ngayon hindi na kami nag uusap and he said he will let me be.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal iPhone 15 case with a card holder should offer a blend of protection, functionality, and style. Let's delve into the critical features to consider.

**Material Quality:** The material used in the case construction is crucial for both protection and aesthetics.

High-quality materials like polycarbonate (PC), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and leather (or vegan leather alternatives) provide varying degrees of impact resistance and durability. PC offers rigidity and scratch resistance, while TPU provides flexibility and shock absorption. Leather adds a touch of sophistication and ages gracefully over time. The specific material composition also affects the case's grip and overall feel in hand.

**Card Holder Capacity and Security:** The number of cards the case can securely hold is a primary consideration.

Most cases accommodate between 1 and 3 cards, but some designs offer greater capacity. The security of the card holder is equally important. Look for features like a secure snap closure, RFID blocking, or a snug fit to prevent cards from slipping out accidentally. Some cases also have a hidden compartment for added security and discretion.

**Protection Level:** The case should adequately protect the iPhone 15 from drops, scratches, and other potential damage.

Features like raised edges around the screen and camera lens are essential for preventing direct contact with surfaces. Reinforced corners provide additional impact protection. Some cases also meet military-grade drop test standards, ensuring a high level of durability. Consider the level of protection you require based on your lifestyle and typical usage scenarios.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The case's design should complement the iPhone 15's aesthetics and reflect your personal style.

Cases are available in a wide range of colors, finishes, and textures. Slim and minimalist designs are popular for those who prefer a sleek look, while more rugged cases offer a bolder and more protective appearance. Consider the overall design and how it integrates with your personal style.

**Ease of Use and Accessibility:** The case should not hinder access to ports, buttons, and the camera.

Precise cutouts are essential for ensuring easy access to all of the iPhone 15's features. The buttons should be easily accessible and responsive, and the camera cutout should not interfere with image quality. The case should also be easy to install and remove when needed.

Key features of the best iPhone 15 cases with card holders include:
 * Durable construction
 * Secure card storage
 * Adequate protection
 * Stylish design
 * Easy access to all features

## Core Benefits

Choosing an iPhone 15 case with a card holder provides several practical benefits that enhance your daily life.

I don’t post on here, but I’m really tired and feel so weird so I wanted to get my thoughts out there just to get them out of my head, and maybe someone else can relate and not feel so alone. It’s a hard thing to go through. 

We’re from Sydney Aus. She’s 86, tiny, skinny little thing. It’s Monday night. Last week on Tuesday she had a heart attack and she’s got a lung infection so she’s getting fluid build up, from that and her heart, she’s had heart failure for a looong time and there have been times in recent years when we thought it was the end and she miraculously came back and i put her in a nursing home. 
On Thursday last week I asked the doctor to take everything off her, they were giving her fluids and medication to keep her heart going even though it was only pumping at 40% capacity. And they had little faith it would help. It’s annoying they don’t suggest it and I felt bad taking it away, like I’m the one who decided she should die.. but I know it’s for the best. I’m her guardian and POA.

The doctor said I was making the right choice. So I went to get a coffee and call family as they said it could be hours or days once they remove it. I went back and everything was already off her besides the catheters so I told them to pull them out. She always hated those.

We are heading into the 5th day on morphine now. She’s been delirious for 3 days, not eating, just tiny bits of ice cream, sometimes asking for sips of water. Sleeping almost all the time. Noisy breathing too, and moaning. When she has been waking up in the last day or two she’s getting agitated. She was yelling at me to get the cleaner to come in her room so she could tell him she wants chicken pie and something else but can’t remember and then goes back to sleep mid sentence. She woke up at one point to yell at me to ‘put it down’ but I didn’t know what. She tells stories about a car on a hill and keys but goes in and out of consciousness. The other day before getting more drowsy she said she could see a little man in the room and was laughing about him.
After seeing her get so agitated yesterday I spent the day at home today to give her space so I can recover cos I’ve been running on adrenaline and coffee. Tomorrow is one week since her heart attack and 5 days in the morphine. 

Questions I have:

- Is the delirium 100% from the morphine or is this her body shutting down too? She can’t breathe, severe sleep apnea and fluid in her lungs. 
- Her getting cranky and telling me to get stuff (I don’t understand what) or to telling me to be quiet, does she want me there or not? I’ll go back tomorrow but I don’t feel like I want to agitate her now. I want to give her company but maybe she doesn’t want it. 
- how much longer? Can I ask the doctors to up her dosage? I don’t want to see her suffer for another week. 

I wanna know what other people have experienced. How can someone so fragile and weak still be fighting this hard? It’s hard to understand for all of us. 

Thanks so much gang 
X

But I'm just surprised because I'm normally the kind of person that freezes up and becomes stunned but I was completely fine, my girlfriend staying on the phone speak to the women while I was doing that but even she said after how did that not freak me out but I don't know myself, after that I showered and washed my clothes as I was just in my socks and pjs but it's got me thinking maybe I can do more then I thought in life.",3,1745842196.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

Help me out please. I’m reaching out because I could really use some advice & guidance (and hopefully meet some awesome people too).

I’m not completely new to Russia — I’ve been visiting SPB since 2017 and totally fell in love with the country.

It’s been a long-time dream of mine not just to visit, but to actually build something meaningful here. After years of planning and dreaming, I’m finally making it official: setting up and expanding my businesses.

Now that I’m doing it, I’m trying to figure out the best way to meet more entrepreneurs, business owners, and good people who might want to partner or collaborate in SPB

I’m not a full-time expat (yet) — I’m here on a business visa that allows me to stay around 180 days a year — but Russia already feels like a second home. So, I’m fully committed to building something long-term and growing two ventures I’m really passionate about:

Travel & Tourism:
I am expanding my travel venture and want to help more foreigners experience the real Russia with personalized trips and bespoke itineraries that go beyond the typical tourist spots.

I’m looking to team up with trustworthy travel agencies, tour guides, and operators in SPB who love showcasing Russia’s incredible culture, nature, and history.

For the past three years, I’ve mainly catered to luxury travelers, but now I’m expanding to offer amazing trips across a wider range of budgets and geographies. 

Garments & Imports:
I’m also setting up a business to import high-quality men’s, women’s, and children’s clothing, custom uniforms, safety gear, and home/office furnishings and a whole lot more — all manufactured by my company — for sale in Russia across both the retail and B2B sectors. I feel there is tremendous scope for growth and sales here, that far exceeds even my travel business. 

Doc I’m looking for solid partners in SPB who can navigate the Russia market and help with logistics, distribution, and retail connections.

Right now, I’m mostly between St. Petersburg and Moscow, but happy to connect anywhere — Ekaterinburg, Sochi, Kazan — wherever there’s opportunity and good people.

So here’s where I’d love some help:

- Where do business-minded people usually network? Anywhere I could advertise these opportunities and seek partners? 

- Any good websites, associations, clubs or communities I should check out? Are there business groups, forums or networks worth joining?

- Any other tips on finding reliable partners, suppliers, and buyers?

- Any other ways expats and locals team up here?

And if you’re into similar projects — or just want to swap ideas over coffee or a quick call — I’d really love that too.

Feel free to DM me anytime and I will share my websites and detailed information. Thanks so much for reading — and wish me luck! (I’m definitely going to need some.)

Is this any good?,"I stared at the blond woman who had just stepped out of the door behind Levi. She kept her face turned away from the camera, but there was no denying it was a beautiful female wearing a very tiny dress. It was the proverbial walk of shame, right out of my boyfriend's hotel room. I stared at the number on the door behind him. There was no denying what I saw.

—
I WOKE AND JUST LIKE the day before, I stared up at the ceiling. No getting out of bed and hitting the ground running for me. I had nothing on my schedule for the day. I didn't really need to do any shopping. I would go the day Levi got back. That way everything would be fresh. That meant my day was clear.
I sighed, rolling out of bed with very little enthusiasm. I was regretting my decision to stay behind. I should have gone to Louisiana with Levi. At least then I would have something to do. Although I knew how the away games worked. I would be left alone in the hotel for almost the entire time. He would be doing press, training, playing, more press and then more press.
I thought about going over to the greenhouse and picking up the painting. I was going to hang it in the living room where it would be in full view from the couch. I couldn't quite muster the energy to do that just yet. I was going to be lazy and kick around the house for a bit.
I checked my phone and found a message from Levi. He had sent it around three this morning. I couldn't help but smile as I read the message aloud. ""We won, of course. I scored two touchdowns, which I'm sure you saw. I love you and miss you.""
He must have been out celebrating with the guys, judging by the time of the message. I probably shouldn't do it, but I called him anyway. His phone would likely go straight to voicemail, which was fine. I just wanted to leave him a quick message letting him know I loved him and was thinking about him.
When voicemail picked up, I was a little disappointed I wouldn't get to hear his voice. ""Hey, baby, I love you. I got your message. I'm so proud of you. I'll call you later. Rest and enjoy a little relaxation today.""
I put the phone down and started a second cup of coffee. I wasn't interested in making a big breakfast and opted for a bowl of cold cereal. It was so much easier than the eggs and smoothies I usually made every morning. My phone rang and I almost jumped on it with the hopes it was Levi returning my call.
""Hello,"" I answered in a sultry voice.
""I'm not him,"" Alexus said.
I pulled my phone away and looked at the screen to verify what I already knew. ""Hey you! What are you doing up so early?""
""I couldn't sleep.""
""Did you go out last night?""
""For a bit. We were all kinds of tired and turned in early.""
I had a feeling she was trying to make me feel better. ""Don't lie. You better be having fun.""
She giggled. ""We are definitely having fun but it would be so much better if you were here. I'm so bummed that you are not.""
""What are you guys going to do today?"" I asked, staring down at my cereal.
""I think we are going to do a little shopping and then hang out at the pool.""
""Do you have tickets for a show tonight?"" I questioned.
""Not tonight. Tonight we are going to hit some of the clubs.""
Again, a feeling of jealousy tore through me. ""Are you going to wear that new dress?""
""I am,"" she said with a laugh. ""How are you doing?""
""I'm good,"" I assured her. ""I painted yesterday and I think I'm going to go back out today.""
""Are you sure you're doing okay?""
""I am. Thank you for asking. Now, don't worry about me. You girls go out and have fun.""
""I'll be thinking about you the whole time,"" she said.
""Thanks. Have fun.""
After her call I felt worse. It wasn't her intention, but hearing that they were having a good time just made me feel even more melancholy. I was supposed to be there. I was supposed to be sitting in a lavish hotel with my best friends and drinking mimosas by the pool. Instead, I was at home alone—as usual.
I dumped out the rest of the cereal, rinsed the bowl, and put it in the dishwasher. I turned on the TV again, hoping to find some highlights. He would quiz me when he got home. He would ask me questions about the little details of a catch and what he did when he scored a touchdown. A good girlfriend would have watched the game. I had been a distracted girlfriend. I wouldn't let it happen again.
I saw his coach and knew I was on the right track. I flopped down on the couch and waited. Soon enough, Levi's face came on the screen before it cut to an obviously surprise interview at his hotel. He hated when they did that. I shook my head, angry on his behalf.
The reporter stuck a microphone in his face. A camera zoomed up on him, giving viewers a very up-close and personal look at those baby blues that had not only captured my heart, but the hearts of the nation. The camera zoomed out a little, a door directly behind him. The reporter started to ask him a question but I didn't hear it. I couldn't hear anything except for a loud buzzing sound in my ears.
I stared at the blond woman who had just stepped out of the door behind Levi. She kept her face turned away from the camera, but there was no denying it was a beautiful female wearing a very tiny dress. It was the proverbial walk of shame, right out of my boyfriend's hotel room. I stared at the number on the door behind him. There was no denying what I saw. It was his hotel room.
He couldn't tell me it was the camera angle that caught the room next door. He couldn't claim it was his publicist or anyone else. Even without all of that, it wouldn't matter. I knew who the girl was. She was like a bad rash. Every time I thought she was out of our lives, she popped back up. I couldn't understand why she wouldn't just leave us alone. I knew he didn't love her. He loved me. She was just the one thing he couldn't quit. She was an addiction.
I sat forward and rubbed my face. Levi's voice filled the room, overwhelming my thoughts. I didn't want to think about him or her or them together. I reached for the remote and turned off the television. I couldn't hear his voice another second. I didn't want to risk seeing her walk back into his room.
""Why, Levi? Why?""
I jumped to my feet, suddenly feeling extremely sick. I raced down the hall to the guest bathroom and threw up the little breakfast I had eaten. Once I was sure the nausea had passed, I got to my feet and splashed cold water on my face.
I stared at my reflection in the mirror. I looked into my own hazel eyes. I had zero makeup on. The freckles that were scattered over my nose and cheekbones were evident. Levi always told me he loved my freckles. Was he lying? I had been through this before. I felt the sting of betrayal and immediately questioned my own looks. I felt insecure and had gone through a whole phase of trying to lose weight and be prettier for him.
Then there was the next time and I realized it wasn't anything I'd done. It was him. He told me it was him. He convinced me I was beautiful and everything he wanted. He promised it would never happen again. He claimed he was weak and couldn't resist the temptation. The woman had flattered him. She'd told him everything he wanted to hear. She had pecked him. She had plied him with alcohol until he couldn't resist her.
That had been the story then and I'd bought it. I forgave him. He made a million promises and I believed him. It was the fame. It had been a confusing time. The instant celebrity had been overwhelming for him. I accepted his excuses and we vowed to move forward. We promised each other we would never let anyone come between us.
""Prick!"" I shouted and slapped my hand against the mirror. The thing shattered, cutting my hand. I felt no pain. I felt nothing. I was so pissed and hurt on a level that physical pain couldn't come close to touching.
I walked out of the bathroom and headed for our bedroom. I was so pissed. I wanted to smash everything. I wanted to break windows and slash tires. I was tired of feeling hurt. I couldn't be hurt anymore. I felt nothing but white-hot anger. He forbade me from going to Vegas out of fear of hurting his reputation and yet he was sneaking women into his hotel room. He was worried about me and he was the one who couldn't keep his shaft in his pants.
I couldn't think straight. Memories of the times he had been caught cheating before overwhelmed me. Memories of the promises he made and the tears he had shed begging me to give him another chance. I was a fool. I didn't know what to do with myself. All I knew was I didn't want to be sitting at home all by myself while he screwed that woman. No wonder he didn't want me to go. How many times had he done this? Had this been going on the whole time?
I stopped moving and took a deep breath. I wasn't going to sit in the house and wait for him while he screwed her. I was going to Vegas. He couldn't stop me. I still had my ticket. I was hoping I could get a flight out right away. If I couldn't, I would charter a plane with his credit card. He gave me the card in case of emergency. In my opinion, this was an emergency.
If I didn't go to Las Vegas, I would find myself in New Orleans. If that happened, I was sure to embarrass him. I was sure to create a scene that would have the tabloids talking for years. They thought Tiger's wife lost her mind. I was feeling downright vindictive at the moment. I would rip the woman's extensions out and Levi, oh boy, I wasn't sure what I would do to his cheating hip.
I stomped back out to the living room and snatched my phone to call the airline. I was in luck and managed to get my ticket changed, for a fee, to a flight leaving in two hours. With my travel arrangements made, I went back to our room to pack. I grabbed my luggage from the bottom of the closet and yanked a few of my skimpiest dresses from the hangers. I would steam them when I got to the hotel. I packed with no rhyme or reason, tossing panties and bras in along with a few bikinis.
I looked over my shoulder as I walked out of the bedroom. I didn't bother making the bed or doing any other housework. I stomped right out the front door and tossed my bags in the car before speeding away. I couldn't get the image of him standing outside his hotel room out of my head. The betrayal cut deep.
I was going to go to Vegas and have fun. I was going to drink and dance and party like the twenty-five-year-old I was. For just one weekend, I wanted to forget the rules. I didn't want to be Levi's girlfriend. I wanted to be me. I wanted to be irresponsible and wild.",1,1745841880.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Registration is the first step cuz you can't donate to someone if you can't be found.
You get a cute little envelope with a registry sheet and two cheek swabs. You do the paperwork, apply the spit, and send it off. You can do that in two ways really; at a registry event where someone gives you the envelope, or online where the UPS man gives you the envelope at your house.

You’re just in the pool of people willing to donate bone marrow if a cancer patient is determined that they need an infusion of healthy bone marrow in order to prop up their unhealthy marrow and survive their condition. You'll only get asked to donate if you get found to be a genetic match for a specific patient who needs YOUR marrow. We all have a genetic twin out there and your chances of finding each other when needed are dependent on both of you being registered. Your chances of actually donating are extremely low. For the most part you'll register and forget you ever did it. If you did register and never donated, that's a good thing! You weren't needed and your twin is doing fine at least as far as their bones are related.



The more people that register the greater the chances are that those perfect matches will be found in time to help. The national database is like a dating service for bones. We are all looking to find our soulmate somewhere in the world that will change our lives, cast a wide enough net, and people will start finding them more often. 



It could be needed for a variety of different reasons; they have a disease that compromised their immune system, chemotherapy damaged their marrow’s ability to reproduce itself, or maybe they were just born with crappy marrow. The new marrow essentially almost completely replaces the old, and leading up to the donation, doctors kill off that old marrow to make room. It can't just be anyone’s juice, they have to have a nearly identical HLA type (which is basically your bone marrow’s DNA) or the body will reject it and kill them. 



*Blood Test:*


You got a call randomly one day, informing you that you were identified as a preliminary match for a patient. Congrats! Preliminary means that the DNA off your swab indicates a high potential of being their perfect donor. It's difficult to get a clear enough picture of your HLA type from that spit through all the nicotine, coffee, and hot pocket particles floating around in it. Your spit was your Tinder profile, now it's time for the first date. 

They will mail a blood vial kit to your nearby clinic of choice. There you will give 6 vials of blood that the clinic will send back for further testing. This process for you takes about 10 minutes max. Once that vial goes through testing you'll be contacted again and you'll begin the drum roll to find out if you're THE match. If you are, you move on to Step 3!

*Physical:*


Kind of a strange step for some. You must go to an approved clinic that will do a quick physical and more testing. That could be local and in-and-out, or, like in my case, you don't have a nearby clinic so they fly you to the donation facility for a couple of days to do it. 

It was super easy. A walk through my medical history, some further lab testing, a physical exam, and you're done for the day. In my case I couldn't be there longer than a day as I had a super packed schedule that week. I flew in at night to beautiful [East Coast Beach City] during a storm. I woke up to the same storm and did my physical. They were so confused as to how many of their donors are suddenly coming from the military (What a mystery!). I hopped back on my plane a couple hours later and Step 3 was done. 

*Donation:*

It was finally time to fly back to [nondescript East Coast Beach City] and do the donation. A 7 day permissive TDY. It was time for the traumatizing, agonizing experience. A sacrifice for my country, one in which I would carry the scars of for life as a testament of the challenges I endured. All to give someone I'd never met another chance at life. To see their family grow and see years pass that they otherwise never would have. It was worth all the cost incurred to myself to pay for it. 


>!So basically I was able to hang out at the beach for a week for free and spend like 20 minutes a day getting a shot.       
Ya fkn drama queens.!<


Nobody is drilling into your bones, no one is spine tapping you. Nobody is touching your bones at all.
The modern method of bone marrow donation is called PBSC, or Peripheral Blood Stem Cell. It's done through the same process as donating plasma or platelets. You know, that thing you do when you want extra beer money. 


For 4 days your job is to come into the clinic in the morning, get 3 shots of Filgrastim and then leave. Filgrastim is a medicine that induces your body to overproduce bone marrow stem cells. They take up too much room in your bones and you shed the excess into your bloodstream. That's it.
 

Your first 4 days are literally just you getting a couple shots in the morning, and then you are free to do literally whatever you want the rest of the time, so long as it doesn’t endanger that sweet sweet bone nectar flowing through your veins. 


I was going to do a Day 1 - Day 2 - Day 3 style post documenting the whole process and journey but honestly there was nothing to document. The documentary would just be 10 seconds of me getting a shot followed by me goofing off all over [Top Secret beach city] each day. 


The symptoms you could expect are fatigue, mild flu-like symptoms, and mild bone pain as the marrow is pushing out the excess. I had none of these things. I was literally chilling, so much so that I got a bit peeved. Where is my great sacrifice? Where is my battle to save a life? How could I possibly open the gates to Valhalla without letting spill the blood of war? It just doesn't work like that anymore. BUT It is just as vital and important. While I was goofing off and having a good time, my recipients' doctors were actively killing their immune system in preparation for my donation to be couriered over by plane and implanted as soon as it was collected. 


The actual donation is on the 5th day. You come in the same as always and go to a different room with an actual bed and get your shots one more time. The vibe is different entirely. When you get your shots is routine for the nurses; small talk the shot and you're off. Here it's almost electric, there's excitement and focus centering around you. I was greeted by one person after another, they want to meet me. They only see maybe two unrelated donors a month. An energetic healthy person in a clinic that only sees those who aren't. Then they put a needle in both arms and hook you up to a machine that collects the Stem Cells and gives you back the rest. Your job from this point is to just nap, watch netflix, chat with the very pretty nurses, whatever. The process takes around 4-5 hours and once you’re done, you are good to go! Literally. Go back to your overly fancy hotel, maybe eat some food and get right back to goofing off until your flight the next day. Just out of sight there's a courier pretty much in a sprinters position with his hand outstretched behind him waiting for the nurse to hand him the goo baggy like it's a baton, so he can blast off to the airport.


The whole time I was donating, the nurses, doctors, and cancer specialists all came in and thanked me and took special care in making sure I was comfortable. But during that I saw they all looked at that goo bag filling up with a strange deferrance, cared after it like it was the most important thing in the building. I realized that I am just a chapter in the story of this bag. I am just the courier of its contents, like a surrogate carries the hopes of a family. It has a life far greater than my small part. It's not for me and it's not about me. I'm part of the team of this staff today and we came together for, what is to me, a complete stranger and a small inconvenience. The staff know exactly what it represents and to whom. It IS a life. They know better than me that this bag has a team of doctors and nurses somewhere far away waiting for it to be rushed through the door. This bag has a family hoping against hope it comes in time. It has a patient fighting for their life awaiting this secret weapon to turn the tide in that fight, and begin taking the offensive. It's the first step in an all new battle for recovery, but it's one they never could have taken part in had I not taken this strange vacation to the beach and sat in a hospital bed for a couple hours.


3,000 People will die this year unable to find their donor. All because people are too scared, too apathetic, too… unregistered to sit in that hospital bed. I am proud that I was able to make that number 2,999. It is up to you to make it 2,998.

**Type**: Passive

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 2.4

**Summary**:

Have you ever wondered why Saiki instead of buying coffee jellies made them himself? He would save a lot of money and with his powers it would be possible.

And it is, the problem is that every time Saiki wants to make a homemade candy, he ends up making the most perfect one in the world. Causing people not to resist and want to have them for themselves, causing a lot of violence. So Saiki no longer tries.

Hi guys,  
Pa-advise naman.

I’m 25M and may friend ako na 25F. Matagal na kaming magkakilala — classmates kami nung preschool, tapos naging classmates ulit nung high school. Nung 8th grade, parang may konting spark/fling sa amin. Naalala ko pa nga na pumunta ako sa bahay niya for her birthday, tapos nag-exchange din kami ng Christmas gifts. Pero honestly, that time, hindi ko pa siya ganun ka-interesado, kaya parang nag-fade out na lang yung “something” between us.

After a few years, nakikita ko siya sa IG na may jowa, pero ngayon, mukhang single siya ulit based sa mga posts niya.

Recently, bigla ko siyang naalala, and narealize ko — kung nagkaroon lang ako ng lakas ng loob dati baka kami na ngayon.  
Ngayon na nagtatrabaho na rin ako at open sa relationship, iniisip ko kung dapat ko siyang i-message sa IG or Messenger para kamustahin and maybe ask her out for coffee or something casual.

Kaso kinakabahan ako. Hindi ko sure kung may dini-date siya ngayon (casual or what), pero mukhang wala pa siyang serious relationship based sa mga nakikita ko.

Sa tingin niyo, dapat ko na ba siyang i-message?  
Any advice kung paano ko siya i-approach?

With a thrill of anticipation, he quickly booked a morning flight and reserved a cosy hotel near the terminal, setting the stage for another unforgettable night together.

I arrived an hour ahead of him, relishing the precious moments to unwind after two days of delightful chaos with my grandchildren. It was the perfect opportunity to catch my breath and freshen up before he arrived. I was riding high on a wave of euphoria, almost bouncing off the walls, overwhelmed with gratitude that this night was happening.

As I anticipated, he strolled in with a fresh haircut and a noticeable weight loss, making him look more attractive than I’d ever seen. 

We hadn’t eaten yet, and it felt like a critical decision: Which hunger should we take care of first? Thankfully, we opted to eat first—a choice we’d be grateful for later! We went to the hotel bar, ordered a light snack and a glass of wine, and savoured the moment. 

The evening was filled with delightful conversations and laughter, making it a night to remember; afterwards, we returned to the hotel room, and I still couldn’t believe I managed to keep my outfit on in the lift! 

Finally, behind the safety of closed doors, we found ourselves in a sanctuary where we could freely embrace our deepest desires. And embrace them, we did, over and over again!

After indulging in our passions, we surrendered to sweet exhaustion, bodies entwined and drifting off to sleep, wrapped in the warmth of shared intimacy.

As the clock struck 3 AM, the world outside was silent. Yet, in the soft glow of dawn's approach, we stirred, an irresistible pull drawing us closer together. I was eager to make the most of the opportunity before dozing some more until the unforgiving alarm shattered the peace at 7 AM. Sleepy and still wrapped in each other, we made love again and lingered a bit longer in that blissful haze.

All too soon, time was running out, so after a quick rejuvenating shower that washed away the remnants of the night, we grabbed breakfast. The scent of coffee mingled with laughter and warm memories. As the morning slipped away, the reality of parting loomed over us. We exchanged lingering kisses, each one filled with unspoken promises and a touch of sadness.

Fantasising about changing his plans and flying off somewhere warm and sunny togther until, with reluctance, he hopped onto the shuttle bound for the airport, and I slid into my car, embarking on the quiet drive home. The roads were familiar, yet I was lost in a swirl of emotions, the memories of our cherished moments still dancing in my mind. With every passing mile, I felt the embrace of solitude pulling me in, yet my heart brimmed with love, carrying me through the ache of longing and fueling my hope until the day he returns.

1k9tndj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k9tndj/iran_april_2025_report/,Iran April 2025 report,"I did 15 days of Iran trip from 11 to 25 April.
I went to Tehran, Kashan, Isfahan, Yazd and Shiraz in this order, all of which by private transfer. I hired a local guide for every city.

Because I was concerned about certain points, let's get to those:
## Arbitrary detention upon entry/exit
I read about this and it remained my concern till the end of my trip.
However, my nationality being Japanese, I thought the risk is quite low for me. This is because Japan is on the visa-free entry list. It's weird seeing Japan, the long-standing US ally, on that list but it definitely made up my mind.
The airport staff were all super friendly. Being Japanese made intereactions smooth and pleasant.
## Money
Money is difficult not only because you rely on currency exchange and carry a big amount of cash, but also because you have to calculate the approximate expenses beforehand.
To give a perspective, I brought 1875 euro into Iran and came back with 825 euro. 
- Single hotel room was 20~40 euro per night.
- Entrance tickets were typically around 2-3 euro
- One restaurant dish was 2-4 euro
- Cab ride in city was 1-2 euro
- Inter-city private transfer was 40 euro from Isfahan to Yazd. Snapp can do it much cheaper.
- Coffee, chai: 1 euro
- Souvenirs weren't that expensive either. 28cmx28cm tilework frame was less than 10 euro.

For carrying rial/toman, typically travellers go for physical cash or debit cards like Mahcard. Physical cash has a problem with convenience and counterfeits. I didn't feel like using Mahcard either because of some reviews. (Now I know ATM withdrawal limit is rather normal for all Iranian bank cards)
My solution was to use my guide/friend's bank card instead. It's of blu bank which lets you do all transactions online apparently. This made possible for topping up my card by currency exchange, ordering cab/food on Snapp and even transfer money privately such as VPN fee. The great advantage of this blu bank is its app. You can check the balance on the app anytime and just omitting 6 digits gives you an approximate value in euro. But you need to know the Arabic numeric characters.
Of course this method carries a risk of misuse by cardholder so should be used with care and only with someone you trust.
Getting the initial toman was easy. My guide handled everything herself so I avoided airport exchange and did it at good rate in Ferdowsi Street.
## Internet
My guide handled this as well. She bought SIM and subsequently set up the SIM for me. One thing to note is because the data is prepaid 3GB, it ran out pretty quickly. Apparently you get SMS when the balance is low, but it's in Farsi so easy to miss. You should be able to check the balance regularly and for topping up the balance, I needed physical cash (hotel staff did it for me).
I bought VPN at home but the one in Iran worked better and flawless. I never had problem connecting to VPN in Iran.
## Hospital
I somehow got a cold in Tehran so went to a hospital on the way to Kashan. Everything went smooth with a Farsi-speaking driver in an hour. The bill was less than five euro including prescription.

Now about each city:
## Tehran
I'm not interested in modern stuff so didn't do much sightseeing there. Sa'dabad Complex has a nice walking path. Expectedly, the air quality was not great. That and sudden temperature change may have caused my sickness. I should've brought a good jacket.
## Kashan
This is a little city famous for historical houses and rose production. I did one-day tour and that was enough for me.
## Isfahan
This city is like a Kyoto of Iran. Both are old capitals and have a river in the city. The Naqsh-e Jahan was great but I didn't really like the people. I got ""Ni-hao"" a lot and people were not as friendly as other cities. I didn't like carpet sellers at the square but good thing is they weren't aggressive. I liked that the people come together to sit and relax on the square. The beauty of Iran is even the famous world heritage sites have such local vibes.
## Yazd
I spent most of the time going to Zoroastrian sites in the suburb. Nice to see the tradition still being alive. Some cafes have a rooftop where you can see the city with wind-catchers. It was fabulous.
Also on the way to Shiraz, I took a tour to Persepolis.
## Shiraz
I'm biased for this city because I spent the most number of days and also met some local students. They were such lovely people, and just like this side of the world, have joys and sorrows just like us. We went together to historical sites, had local dishes and talked about lots of topics. I found them intelligent, open-minded and very hospitable. It was the highlight of my trip.

## Summary
Iranian people have tea before anything. Coming from Japan, I find it a great attitude to life. The people were mostly friendly and genuine. I didn't encounter aggressive people like in India.
It's definitely a place I'd visit again. But I'm speaking just for myself, being East Asian and male.",23,1745841193.0,travel,3,0.93,False

**Age:** 21 years old  
**Sex:** Male  
**Height and Weight:** 169 cm / 69 kg  
**Medical conditions:** None diagnosed. No chronic medication use.  
**Lifestyle:** I drink about two cups of tea per day, no caffeine abuse, no recreational drugs, non-smoker. I have periods of caffeine abuse (like any student) but for the last 4 months ive been only drinking tea to reduce it.

Problem:

I have a weird vigil problem which also translates into sudden sleepyness. I am like really aware of falling asleep. And i can be talking, have a deep breath and start like nodding or start hallucinating (mor in depth) later.

But i also have a clear arch like tunnel vission as an early sleepyness sympthom and severe light phobia and difficulties to sleep at night sometimes. I have had this since i was five at least and i would say always but i dont really remember.

The narcolepsy like thing started happening more during 2021 (i was 17) and it was a really exigent yeat as it was my first year at uni and last at seconday and so i was doing a lot. I remember that I've never experienced actually not wanting to and fall asleep and started happening. I thought it was bc of my exigent routines but 4 years have passed and like is the same

# Detailed description:

* Since the age of 5, I have experienced **sudden episodes of extreme sleepiness**, even during high-demand activities (e.g., riding a motorcycle, active conversations). Actually getting hallucinations of vigil while riding in a winding road
* These episodes often occur **after 20–30 minutes of exposure to natural light**.
* I have really high light sensitivity. If you flash me with a torch my eyes start crying. I always drive with sunglasses
* And the white lines separating the lanes on long straights of hours start looking as an amalgam of white, yellow and fuchsia after like an hour or so
* Before falling asleep, I experience **hypnagogic visual phenomena**: I see **moving dark oval-shaped patches** drifting forward toward the horizon, especially in bright environments. I would describe them as arches on the outter vission which have a given frequency and they kind like go into the horizon. Like it feels as if i was sending waves to what im looking. This arches are dark but not like black. Just darker and blurer
* Following this, I often **perceive objects or events that are not actually happening** (for example, imagining roadblocks in the the distance)
* This is followed by **head-nodding sleep attacks** and full sleep onset.
* On this phase i have dreams which in my brain may feel like a while (never had one outside from my bed i think) on whats happening in the real world. Like i remeber having a full dream of me being in a waterfall when my partner went to the bathroom and pushed the WC
* During sleep, I **move frequently** (e.g., removing socks, changing positions a lot).
* I have **chronic nocturnal bruxism** (teeth grinding during sleep).
* I experience occasional **hypnic jerks** (falling sensation while falling asleep), roughly once a month.
* No episodes of screaming. I don't have typical sleep paralysis in which a monster will kill me. But i have seconds after actually waking up dreams with my room as the enviroment but i am actually aware this is a dream
* I **dream every night**, sometimes with **lucid dreams**, but **I quickly forget most dreams** unless I consciously try to remember right after waking up. And during any of this phases my memory is really bad compared to normal me. Alll the memories of this are 4 sure latter reconstruction my brain made
* Occasionally, **brief disorientation upon waking** (not knowing where I am for a few seconds).
* Family history: **my paternal aunt has sleepwalking episodes** (somnambulism) and my father sever head pain always (not cancer) but he is not willing to treat that
* Using a smartwatch, I track an average of **7h30min of sleep per night**, with sleep quality scores ranging from **68 to 87** (rated ""acceptable"" to ""good"").
* Sleep duration varies slightly (from 6h15min up to 9h07min), with relatively stable bedtimes.
* No history of epilepsy, migraines, or diagnosed sleep apnea.
* No current medication use.
* Low caffeine intake (only tea, no coffee or energy drinks).
* No history of head trauma or neurological diseases i remember of. When i was kid i surely i got hit on my head but nothing crazy

Should i comment this to my clinical or i will spend money on a dead end?

Could this pattern suggest a **sleep-wake regulation disorder** (e.g., **mild atypical narcolepsy** or **idiopathic hypersomnia**)?

Are my **visual phenomena and ""seeing things that are not there""** signs of **REM intrusion** into wakefulness?

1k9tkcj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9tkcj,Me-made capsule for 3 day work trip (UK),"Hello from a recent lurker, first time poster!

**Background:** I (29y/o she/they) work remotely for a UK charity that meets in-person for a two day team meeting in a different city 4x a year. We usually stay in a budget hotel (this time it is an Ibis Budget) and we go to a separate meeting space during the days for presentations, team building workshops etc. There is no dress code but on the whole it's very casual, lots of people wear jeans and trainers. 

The last day of this team meeting is the first day of #memademay, where sewists tend to share their me-mades, so I thought it would be fun to document a little me-made capsule, alongside all the other stuff I bring. We're also due some unseasonally warm weather, which is nice!

I'll take all of this in my [IKEA Varldens 26l backpack](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/vaerldens-backpack-black-30487924/) \- I got it maybe 5 or 6 years ago now? I use it regularly for these 2-3 day trips as well as for everyday. It's not fancy but it works!

**Day 1 - wfh in the morning and then train in the afternoon.** After I arrive I will explore the city a little in the early evening then either meet up with colleagues (if I have energy) or have dinner in my hotel room (more likely - the next two days are very full on socially)

* Bamboo jersey striped [bateau top](https://fridaypatterncompany.com/products/friday-bateau-top-pdf-pattern?srsltid=AfmBOoqW3Z-3fuK23YZdcj2-WgSFYe0_jwLJ7eqkgWFotjZ01YuVgTDi) (free pattern!)
* Black linen wide leg [pomona pants](https://annaallenclothing.com/products/pomona-pants-shorts) (my GOAT trouser pattern - super comfy elastic waist but I add belt loops so I can dress it up if I want to)

**Day 2 - Meetings 10am-5pm, team dinner in the evening**

* Gingham linen/viscose [zadie jumpsuit](https://papertheorypatterns.com/products/zadie-jumpsuit-pdf-pattern) \- the fit on this pattern is a bit weird, but suits me as a person with big hips
* Gives me a chance to sink-wash and air-dry the trousers if I spill something on them on the first day (which as a clumsy person I often do)

**Day 3 - Meetings 9-4pm, train home in the evening**

* Self-drafted brown viscose wrap top 
* Same pomona pants as before

**Other clothes:**

* [Agnes pyjamas](https://papertheorypatterns.com/products/agnes-pjs) \- fold up small, comfy enough to lounge around in.
* Black cardigan (thrifted) - just in case the train, meeting room etc are heavily air conditioned or I want to be cosy in the hotel in the evenings.
* Denim jacket (thrifted) - the evenings still get chilly, and it has lots of useful pockets for when I'm travelling (I think I can fit as much in the pockets of this as a uniqlo mini shoudler bag)

**Shoes:**

* Taking a bit of a risk here but I got these new [timberland greyfield sandals](https://www.schuh.co.uk/womens/timberland-greyfield-black-sandals/1715057050/?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAABVcTKEu4nPQ3GYM_dgxUMS-ESemO&affiliate_source=AW&campid=1127&adid=0&lpcat=network&channel=affiliate&utm_source=AW-shoppingdirectory&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=shareightoctercss&awc=2044_1745826251_74e492d51b3fd008dcb7d391b752c96f) recently, they're smart enough for both work and comf/light enough for walking, and I've had enough of wearing trainers/loafers - I want it to be summer!
* I LOVE these extremely [cheap foldable slippers](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/156849286502?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D1110006%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20231207125618%26meid%3D7f1091aa071e40a3a6f81fabcaad9303%26pid%3D101875%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D12%26sd%3D286283282608%26itm%3D156849286502%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2332490%26algv%3DSimplAMLv11WebTrimmedV3MskuWithLambda85KnnRecallV1V2V4ItemNrtInQueryAndCassiniVisualRankerAndBertRecallWithVMEV3CPCAutoWithCassiniEmbRecall&_trksid=p2332490.c101875.m1851&itmprp=cksum%3A1568492865027f1091aa071e40a3a6f81fabcaad9303%7Cenc%3AAQAKAAABcNnX%252FcPSJ4FQoNUs8iW9d3TTdveHEGYK%252F99oxoRSM0U4bA%252F0pel740HFSnLmNo8XaXFf3LY94VNsllcUHn%252FJtRSziVjKEEDlraork%252BGVpOZJJFdtIFmTnDC7UCpFP2E69q7yDRkCBMpHAWHs%252F32bJnpsae4oUfvCeeTTMMYRHTT8g%252FZTV6W6afE%252FPUcC2Ni3zknXECZXH7jGZn71Bu7YUZd%252BzBZjkj2mNEVGMSPh0khdvgFEGkOv6bHesoxyCGAlBVMERd%252BUW4wiTIYyqQWvWm3yLSJTlJpVgOrS8OVovYjywuPoThYqu%252Fg4Ko6QuzCZq4Nwl2S4NNxi5V4V1qLCkqgyHUJoGi9M9IkypTHyXROALHoG8OaiCUw3cNQ1kGiRcORokXqEz%252BC0rikJJLUfaf%252Bn4OsZnvrqt5XxoU3YQRaD8DMg0FL5fjiOl41OURz2YA1yCr82JJ30ciC%252Bkg0az5RM%252B%252BPQYDwjGCQqxtLjbTXD%7Campid%3APL_CLK%7Cclp%3A2332490&itmmeta=01JSY281ZS2VRK4FFMD9VKSQ7T) (similar to the sort you get in hotels), just for pottering around in the hotel room. They fold up really small and weigh basically nothing.

**Tech:**

* Macbook air 13in (work laptop) 
* Earphones w lightning adaptor 
* Anker 10000mAh power bank 
* [Rolling square 30cm cable 100W](https://rollingsquare.com/products/xls?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign={campaign.name}&utm_content={ad.id}&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzrzABhD8ARIsANlSWNNUbFulKgb3KbWT8tz--EniMFrXxdDjUBWHlfWGmcdYkKW2sv_4fZ4aAijREALw_wcB&tw_source=google&tw_adid=&tw_campaign=19721071094&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAoaGhbrr-P0KbmQs_x5vkQOh8tWuc) \- I use this to charge my latop but can charge any of my devices. It is really short but my laptop battery usually lasts fine for the day, and then I charge it right next to the socket overnight. I love not having to carry around loads of long tangled cables!
* PZOZ keychain cable - so handy for charging my phone with the power bank (this was sadly from the bad place but there are [good jeff-free alternatives!](https://rollingsquare.com/products/incharge%C2%AE-xs-240w-4in1-keyring-cable))

* Galaxy Tab A9 tablet (8in) - for reading & entertainment on the train and at my hotel
* iPhone 12 mini - when I upgrade I would consider getting something bigger and not having to bring a tablet as well, but I have tiny hands and love how easily it fits into any pocket, and my thumb can reach the whole screen!

**Food & drink:**

* I'm a coffee snob, I'm not proud of it, but it's the truth! Not only will I not drink instant but one aeropress isn't enough for me! I like to wake up early and have a couple of cups while I read my book. This [travel french press](https://ravecoffee.co.uk/products/timemore-french-press-u?variant=42416743973032&country=GB&currency=GBP&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADqw01Ek8YzGB3JRoAY7mickSHLDH&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzrzABhD8ARIsANlSWNMv8F4P1xrbXC51niAhg--0dGxmAHxUGIOjroVZC9aEwBQjHkF4cDIaAq5dEALw_wcB) is heavier and more annoying to clean than an aeropress but it's easier to use and makes more coffee. The rubber sleeve keeps the glass safe for transport and insulates the coffee, keeping it hot for around 45 mins. If I was trying to minimise weight I would definitely swap this for an aeropress go, but I don't have an aeropress go and I do have this, and for these short trips, it works.
* I'll grind my coffee at home just before I leave on the first day, and take it with me in a ziplock which I'll sort of stuff inside the chamber of the cafetiere I have thought about getting a travel hand grinder but the good/compact ones are expensive and although I'm a snob, I'm not \*that\* much of a snob!
* Water bottle, travel mug, travel cutlery - none of these are particularly special but they're the ones I have and I'll use them til they break! 

**Toiletries & Make-up:**

* I recently invested in this[ stand-up make up bag from muji](https://uk.muji.eu/products/nylon-stand-up-makeup-bag-19987) and I love it. I used to have a cheap hanging toiletries bag but couldn't always find a convenient place to hang it next to the mirror in hotels. All of the little pockets in this one make me so happy, and they fit my mini decanted toiletries really nicely - I use a mix of the muji 10g (most cosmentics) and 30g tubes (shampoo, conditioner etc). 
* I am a muji fan girl but have had mixed success with the accessories. The travel eyelash curler is great whereas I'm not that fussed on the travel cheek brush - it's expensive (more expensive than the pouch it lives in!) and the bristles aren't as dense as my regular one, but it is handy that it's self contained so bronzer doesn't everywhere.
* Contents (see 2nd pic): 2x emery boards, clinique black honey lip balm, glossier cloud paint, nars mini bronzer, decanted foundation, mini ilia mascara, eyebrow pencil, eyeliner, micellar water, cleanser, serum, moisturiser, eye cream, hair curl gel, nail polish, muji travel eyelash curler, roll on perfume, wild mini deodrant, shower gel, conditioner, shampoo, muji travel cheek brush, colgate travel toothbrush, colgate mini toothpaste, burt’s bees tinted lip balm.

**Everyday pouch:**

* See 3rd pic - I keep this [little pouch](https://uk.muji.eu/products/double-fastener-case-s-9822) in whichever bag I take when I leave the house, just sort of everyday essentials. I like that it has two compartments, one mesh and one enclosed.
* Mesh pocket: Paracetemol, 3x plasters, hand sanitiser, sewing kit, 
* Enclosed pocket: 6x tampons, 3x pads

Ok - that is probably enough for now! Any feedback/questions? I leave tomorrow, so still time to edit if you think I'm missing something or taking too much. Thanks for reading! :-)

Yesterday, I visited a local, independent coffee shop to read a book and ordered a piece of cake. There was a clear sign at the counter that said “self-service” and pointed to both the ordering and pick-up spots.

When I was about to pay, the friendly and approachable lady explained that I had to choose an option on the payment terminal to leave a tip or not. Since they offered only self-service, I clicked “no tip.” However, the moment I did, she visibly got sad and disappointed… and also completely broke eye contact (which was very direct moments before) and kept looking away for the rest of the interaction. It made me feel awkward, while I also felt that my decision was perfectly fine. But how annoying it is that they keep the terminals to automatically ask about the tips? Like, I know from a friend owning a cafe-bookstore that it is possible to switch off the automatic tipping request, and so he did. 

It makes me question whether the people working at cafes, in Germany, earn so little that they rely on tipping? But then, what do we tip for if it’s a self-service? They just take a few clicks on the computer and print out the receipt, while a colleague takes around 30 seconds to put the cake on a plate and place it on the counter for me to collect and bring to the table.

So, I’m not trying to be sarcastic on not thoughtful, but I genuinely want to understand the logic or some kind of reasoning behind this. 🧐",24,1745840639.0,germany,32,0.9,False

Otherwise I’d need to take benzos to relax my jaws every darn time. I can’t even drink “coffee” and I’m not exaggerating. Just now I got myself a “hot chocolate”;  and I swear to God I only had a few sips and my jaw is now clenching like crazy. Wtf? Next time I’m ordering plain hot milk. I have a severe overbite/short face caused by my ortho treatment. The ortho itself caused the clenching and I relapsed and my skeletal issue got worse. I did ortho two times and was never told I needed “surgery”. 

I did many consultations abroad but still haven’t had my jaw surgery yet.  I haven’t found any competent surgeon locally and still can’t afford to do it abroad because it literally means I have to relocate and live wherever I’m doing this surgery. Where I currently live no orthodontist would agree to deal with a surgeon “remotely”. 

 I hate having to take benzos every time I clench. I’m beginning to worry for their long term use effects especially on cognition. It’s enough that my facial structure is fucked. I don’t want to lose my brain too.

1k9tgqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k9tgqr/reveal_the_secrets_behind_the_delonghi_la/,Reveal the secrets behind the De'Longhi La Specialista Opera espresso machine review!,"The **De'Longhi EC9555M La Specialista Opera Espresso Machine** is one stunning piece of coffee-making equipment that I’ve had the chance to use daily for the past few weeks. Calling it just an espresso machine feels a bit undermining—it’s more like a full-service coffee studio packed into a sleek stainless steel body. The blend of traditional espresso-making processes with modern innovations is heavenly for anyone who takes their coffee-making seriously. However, as tempting as it is to rave about the perks, there are details you shouldn’t overlook before diving in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed it, I couldn’t help but admire the machine’s aesthetic appeal. The sleek stainless-steel finish makes it look right at home in a modern kitchen, but the real highlight isn’t just the looks—it’s its thoughtful design. Every dial, button, and knob is placed where it feels natural, making operation smooth, even for beginners. Be warned, though—this is a substantial machine. Measuring 14"" deep, 15"" wide, and 17.5"" high, it’s big. I initially set it up on a smaller counter, but quickly relocated it to a sturdier space because it really commands its own area. **Make sure to measure your kitchen space before committing!**

[Check De'Longhi EC9555M price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d1ty3h2j/)

**Functionality and Features**  
Where do I even begin? The machine includes an integrated 15-setting coffee grinder, allowing me to adjust the grind size with precision. When brewing, I noticed the Smart Tamping Technology comes to the rescue—it minimizes mess and ensures an even tamp every single time. I’ve experimented with its three infusion temperature settings (thanks to Active Temperature Control) and found that they absolutely unlock the best flavors from different beans. One of the most jaw-dropping features, however, is the proprietary Cold Extraction Technology. Imagine being able to create a cold brew espresso in just five minutes! The ability to switch seamlessly between hot espresso, cold options, and even americano was a huge win for me—and my partner, who swears by cold brews for daytime work sessions.

**Advantages**  
This machine has a long list of selling points, but here are the key highlights:  
- Smart Tamping Technology guarantees consistent results without the usual guesswork.  
- The 15-setting integrated grinder handles various bean varieties for perfect dosing.  
- The commercial-style steam wand produces microfoam ideal for latte art or cappuccinos.  
- Multiple beverage presets make crafting espresso, cold brew, and americanos intuitive.  

**Areas of Concern**  
Despite all the fancy features, there were minor hiccups:  
- The grinder, while excellent, is non-removable—cleaning it requires some finesse with brushes.  
- The machine’s steam wand tends to overheat milk, leading to froth inconsistencies at times.  
- As much as I adore the size and quality, its large footprint can overwhelm smaller kitchen spaces.

**Ease of Use and Learning Curve**  
This espresso machine leans more toward the semi-automatic category, so there’s definitely a slight learning curve involved—especially if you’re used to capsule-based systems. My wife and I had to refer to the manual a couple of times, particularly to understand the lights and brewing display modes. Surprisingly though, De’Longhi included highly detailed instructions for the water hardness test, which was straightforward. I found YouTube tutorials helpful in mastering its steaming functions for milk, especially when trying to avoid creating overly large milk bubbles.

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this model to other popular espresso machines, like the Breville Barista Pro or Gaggia Anima Prestige, there are notable distinctions. The Breville, for instance, offers excellent grind control and versatility, but its tamping isn’t as simple as De’Longhi's lever-based model. On the other hand, Gaggia excels in milk frothing capabilities but lacks the cold brew functionality that makes this machine such a standout. Having tried both competitors in the past, I can confidently say this machine blends enhanced usability with unique features like the five-minute cold brew setting, which the others lack.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Is this machine worth the investment? If coffee-making forms an integral part of your routine, the answer is a resounding yes. Sure, you could stick to lower-end espresso makers, but then you miss out on features like Cold Extraction Technology or precise temperature settings. What truly sweetened the deal for me was how it caters to both espresso perfectionists and casual drinkers alike. This isn’t just a machine for enthusiasts—it’s an elevated experience, wrapped in thoughtful design and versatility. Take into account its sturdy components and multi-functionality, and it absolutely offers great value for its price.

Earlier this morning, I found a candidate who seemed perfect: great CV, strong career history, right location, and salary expectations. I had his CV open on my screen but got busier responding to emails and handling other tasks. I then left my desk to grab a coffee. When I returned and called him, he told me that someone else had already called and submitted his application about 30 minutes earlier.

And I can swear that this draw Julian's eyes for an instant, even if he quickly turns away. Hum… “Because you seem to be high.” He sighs, running his hand through the blond hair, “Are you listening to yourself?” “Yes. I want you to take my virginity.” I say firmly, and he grunts, “Listen, it makes sense! You're handsome, women are always at your feet, and you're great at having one-night stands!” “You're not serious.” “Yes, I am. Besides, you're my friend…” “And \*your father's best friend\*.” He stresses, “Need I mention that I'm ten years older than you?” “That means more experience…. And that's all a virgin need!” Julian gives a dry laugh, crossing his arms as well, “Let's consider that none of that matter. Still, I don't do with virgins.” “Why?” I ask, disappointed, shrugging my shoulders. He sighs, gritting his teeth…. “Angelee, you shouldn't act like this just because it didn't work out with an asshole. You're still young, surely, you'll meet someone who will be worth the wait…” “No, I'm not doing this to get back at him.” I turn away, walking around the apartment, feeling my nerves flare. “You don't understand… It's not like I wanted to wait this long.” Julian frowns, as I sit down on the stool, “What do you mean?” “Because he wanted to marry a virgin, I had to refrain for four years! But while I was holding back, he was sleeping around! I was frustrated for four years, Julian!” I throw my body back, leaning against the kitchen island, and add with a grunt, “He had the nerve to say I'm like the favorite food he leaves to eat last! Really, I can't believe I wasted so much time over a bastard like him!” He approaches in silence, as if his mind is full of thoughts… and stops in front of me. I look at him again with a conflicted expression. “He hasn't even touched me properly this whole time… You know what I mean? I don't want to lose my virginity because I'm angry at Eric. I'm just tired of having to satisfy myself alone. Hah, I feel like an idiot.” Julian swallows dryly — I watch his Adam's apple move slowly, drawing my eyes. “You know… maybe the problem is me.” I mutter, lowering my head and averting my eyes from him, staring at the pale skin of my thighs. “You're not the problem, Angel.” Julian says in a low, slightly husky tone. When I raise my eyes shyly and meet his, he swallows dry again. “No, I'm sure… I can't make a man horny…” My voice fails me the next moment, when Julian's hands are spreading my knees, making room for his body to fit between my open legs. Resting his hands on the kitchen island, as if cornering me, Julian presses his hips against mine, rubbing his hard-on directly between the middle of my legs. \*Oh my Gosh.\* I hold my breath and seal my lips, trying to keep any sound from coming out between them, and I see a discreet smile rise on Julian's lips. “See? You're not the problem…” He says, taking one of his hands off the counter, sliding down my arm until it reaches my hip. I think I'm dreaming- My thoughts are interrupted as Julian pulls my hip towards his and pushes himself harder against the most sensitive part of me — and this time, I can't hold back the low moan that escapes loudly. I stare at Julian lips as he says slowly, “If there's anything wrong, it's certainly with that asshole… Especially when you're in that underwear…” A silly smile appears on my lips as I blink slowly, leaning in slightly, “Did you like it?” “If I like it?” He leans in as well, bringing our faces even closer together, sliding his hand into my bare thighs, up my skirt, threatening to reach my crotch. “I've been having a hard time to forget… as you can tell.” Giggling, I cross my legs around his hips. I simply love how Julian looks surprised and how he holds his breath, closing his eyes, trying to change his thoughts. Huh, I can feel his warmth invading my body, mingling with mine, and can even smell the scent of his cologne sinking deliciously into my skin. “We shouldn't be doing this…” He mumbles, still with his eyes closed, as if reason is winning the battle inside his mind… “And why is that?” I murmur back, brushing my lips against his chin, threatening to rise. “You are… My best friend's daughter…” I slide my hands down his shirt slowly, exploring the fabric that tickles my fingers, until finally reach the waistband of his pants. I bite my lips, and I know he can feel it because my teeth rub against his chin as well. His heat is rising up in my head. I know I'm losing my mind. I know shouldn't be running my hand down his pants, almost touching the erection that, unfortunately, is no longer touching my panties. And he knows that as well — because his hand holds mine firmly, preventing me from continuing. “Angel…” My nickname escapes so subtly through his lips that it makes my skin shiver. “No one needs to know, Julian.” I whisper, moving my lips up to meet his, subtly brushing our mouths together as I add in the same low tone, “Just once.” “I don't want to hurt you.” He says, almost in a whisper, against my mouth. His eyes are intense, and I can find hunger shining in them. Lowering my eyes, I finally understanding why he doesn't do with virgins. In fact, just by feeling him rub against me, I know he's huge. And this should probably scare me, since I have never dared to thrust my own fingers, but… Gosh, I'm so horny. I want him. “I don't care.” Disengaging the hand he holds, I finally move down to the erection that, even inside his pants, I'm unable to hold properly. I try to squeeze it and hear a hoarse moan escaping from deep in Julian's throat. My body is so hot… it's like I'm a volcano with years of delayed eruption. “Julian…” This is the thread of sanity that's missing for his conviction to break. He holds my nape abruptly and pulls me into a fervent kiss, tasting my lips first before forcing it to part, to put his tongue into my mouth, causing pleasurable shivers when it touches and intertwines with mine. And he’s pressing me further against his hip, this time properly fitting his hard-on on the middle of my legs, rubbing against my clit, while pressing my breasts against his chest, making the kiss deeper and more passionate… While one hand dictates the rhythm by holding my nape, I can feel the other hand lowering the strap of my top and bra, which may not be the same one he saw last night, but will certainly be scratched in his mind. And when he unlinks his fingers from my hair, bringing both hands down to my hips, I expect him to lift me off that damn bench and carry me to bed… Indeed, Julian does seem to be about to do that… Except that the apartment bell rings, so low that we don't pay much attention. But the second attempt is fast and frantic, which makes our mouths part slowly. With his eyes closed tightly and his hard-on throbbing inside his pants, against my wet panties, he remains still, without moving a single muscle. I pray to the heavens that the bell doesn't ring again, so I can continue to delight in his touch… But that's not what happens, of course. Julian lowers his head and grunts, apparently annoyed and disappointed. When he raises his green eyes and inspects my face, Julian brings his hand lovingly to my cheek, depositing a quick kiss on my lips. “I'll be right back…” He says, stroking my cheek with his thumb before pulling away. My heart is beating frantically… so fast it might rip through my chest. \*What the hell am I doing?\* I press my knees against each other, trying to get rid of the tickle that's taking over my belly…. “Cathy?” Julian's surprised voice brings me back to sudden reality. Oh… Of course… My sudden visit probably spoiled his plans… I feel a mixture of anxiety and sadness hammering in my chest, but I struggle to get up from the stool and pull my skirt down, while fixing my hair which has likely been messed up by the fervent kiss. Kiss. I kissed Julian Adams…. My father's best friend. “No, I'm a little busy right now…” Julian says, with his arm blocking the way into the apartment. But when I approach and place my hand on his back, I feel him freeze immediately. \*Don't worry, Julian… I won't ruin your evening.\* “It's okay, I'll be right there. Thanks for the advice, I’m going to home.” I give a sweet smile and look at the tall girl, who is looking at me surprised and somewhat… angry? Blonde, blue eyes, thin… Yes, this is exactly Julian Adams type…. My complete opposite. Fearfully, Julian pulls back his arm and allows me to pass. With my cheeks burning with embarrassment and perhaps other feelings I wouldn't want to admit even to myself, I retreat from the apartment. But before turning my back, I greeted this Cathy with a friendly smile. My steps are quick, and soon I'm unlocking my door which, fortunately, is straight ahead, so I can disappear from the sight of both. The thud of the door echoes too loudly. And as I’m leaning my back on it, I lower my eyes, listening to what is going on outside. “… I guess you're free now?”



**05 — New day, new life.**

I stare into the mirror, noticing the deep dark circles under my eyes. I couldn't sleep well after leaving Julian's apartment… Now, I look awful. Closing my eyes, I take a deep breath. Not even the shower and the hot coffee is preparing me to face this day. Because not only I have to meet Julian — who’s inevitably my boss — but also Laura, my best friend, who was screwing my boyfriend. It’s time for facing the reality. A new day, \*new life\*. Courage is leaking out of the pores of my skin, and I'm seriously considering making up some excuse. Maybe I could say that my head still hurts? Or who knows, some big unforeseen event has come up? Should I call Dad and whine for time off? A grunt escapes my lips and I grab my hair. No way, Julian won't leave me alone. I take another deep breath and pat my cheek twice, encouraging myself with a smile, fixing my hair and finally leaving the apartment, praying to heavens that my day will be peaceful… \*But of course not\*. The universe is constantly playing with me. Julian is coming out of his own apartment, in his impeccable pencil suit and blonde hair combed up. Honestly, it must be just wonderful to wake up and see this man as the first thing in the morning. Even in the suit, his physique can be pointed out. Inevitably, Julian is hot as hell. He looks at me with surprise on his face, but it soon quickly disappears, giving way to a sweet smile and caring eyes. “Good morning, Angel, want a ride?” Oh, I definitely want a ride. I let out the air I didn't even realize had held and swallow dry, feeling my throat narrow, suddenly too shy. “Oh, no, I- I have something to do before work…” The words choke out and disappear on my tongue. What's up with me? Damn it, Angelee, you don't know how to act like a normal person? “I can take you there…” “No need, it's right here on the street… no problem, really. I'll be on time.” I give an awkward smile as walk to the elevator. It's not like I regret knocking on his door yesterday and saying those things. I really don't regret it… But inevitable, I feel a little disappointed that the night ended that way. I know I can't complain, after all, I was the one who left his apartment that way… But still, a bitter taste persisted in my mouth, knowing that Julian had enjoyed the evening with another woman while I had to relieve the sensations that he caused me all by myself. We stop side by side in front of the elevator, and I press the button quickly, harder than usual. I try to disguise my discomfort, but I guess I'm not good at it, since Julian is watching me intently. His gaze is so piercing that I feel my skin heat up — and his smell… his cologne reminds me of last night. The elevator doors finally open, and I'm faster than I intended. I wait for him to follow me and press the button. And as the doors close, trapping me in this cubicle with Julian, his scent invades my nostrils even more. I close my eyes tightly, trying to set my thoughts and not let the memories invade my body and bring heat between my legs… Well, it's not working. Julian cleans his throat, and I watch, out of the corner of my eyes, as he loosens his tie, as if the collar is too tight. I stir, knocking my heel on the elevator floor. This slight noise attracts his attention, and he sets his eyes down on the floor, finally noticing my clothes, “Did you put heels on?” Throw my hair over my shoulder, I try not to show my sudden discomfort and shyness, “Is your sight bad?” I try not to smile as I see the sarcastic smile sprouting on his lips… “I guess it is, or maybe I'm asleep… I never thought I'd see you in an attire like that again.” Feeling his green eyes pinch my skin, I saw how it’s reaching my exposed ankles lifted by the high heels, up the midi skirt that's clinging to my thighs and hips, to the high waist that hides my flat belly. And I can also observe that he takes more than a few moments to take his eyes off the neckline of my shirt, which highlights my breasts. Julian quickly loosens his tie a little more, even messing up his always impeccable appearance. “You don't like it…? Maybe I look better in your shirt?” I say with a smug smile and notice that my words came out probably more provocative than I meant. He opens his lips to answer me, but thankfully the elevator doors open, revealing the lobby. I'm quick to get out of the elevator, and I throw a smile over my shoulder, “See you at work.” Julian's expression is serious as he watches me intently, until the metal doors close again to take him out into the parking lot. Alone, I finally take a deep breath, filling my lungs with fresh air. I'm getting crazy. \*\*\* I take a cab right in front of my building, and it doesn't take long before we're driving through the busy streets of New York City, under a sky so clear it looks like a painting. I cling to see the walkers, the stores on the sidewalk, and the smallest details that pass by the window, hoping that at least a bit of Julian will be left out of this confused mind of mine. And maybe this is why I didn't notice that the driver was already pulling in front of the company. I quickly pay and get out of the cab, breathing loudly and entering the building. With a smile, I give a good morning to whoever passes me, getting into the elevator, where I press the button (7º). Taking a deep breath, I gather my courage as the elevator doors open to reveal the hallway before the office where most of the staff work. Unconsciously, I straighten my clothes, pulling down my skirt and fixing my hair, which is loose and flowing down my shoulders. I finally walk towards the team, with my heels lightly tapping the ground. Even though the day has just begun, the atmosphere is already bustling. My co-workers are still sitting in their seats with a smile on their faces, typical of someone who woke up in a good mood — which definitely doesn't apply to me. But still, I force a smile as I approach my desk, “Good morning.” I feel eyes on me, burning my skin. Throwing my bag over my workstation, I try not to think much about how surprised everyone seems at my appearance, as I’m sitting down in the chair, disappearing behind the partition. Of course, I know the reason for such a reaction. My appearance used to be very modest, and I never came to the office with loose hair before; it was always up in a high, tight bun. Furthermore, I didn't use make-up, earrings, or accessories — although my clothes were elegant. At work, I'm always discreet, especially since my dear ex-boyfriend works in the next building. But it wasn't always like this, though. In high school and my first year of college, I was considered the belle, but Eric got annoyed with the way men looked at me. Honestly, I'm not sure when I stopped getting all dressed up, but I do know that words from him led me down this path. They were things like — \*you don't need make-up, you're beautiful naturally, honey. Don't wear so much make-up, it hides your beauty.\* And even though I wasn't tall, he would tell me — \*don't wear high heels, darling, you'll get taller than me… It's odd when a woman is taller than a man. … Aren't these things too flashy? Don't you think it's too indecent? People are looking and judging, dear.\* Indecent? Flashy? I started dressing almost like a nun to please him, simply because I didn't notice his manipulative webs. Even if I saw a tight dress or a low-cut skirt and really liked it, I knew there was no point in buying it, after all, I could never wear it. My high shoes, my favorite clothes… I kept them all in a box in the back of the closet, wearing only what he chose. And for what? To Eric betray me with a woman who is precisely what he said don’t like. Suddenly, I raise my eyes and see that there's a woman right in front of me, standing on the other side of my partition… The person I considered my best friend since the first year of College… the one I trusted with my secrets and my worries: \*\*Laura\*\*. My cheating best friend.



**06 — My “best friend”**

Laura and I first met during our late years of High School, when I arrived in New York to chase my only family member left — my father… Someone I came to know existed when my mother was already fighting her final battle with cancer. She was my first friend in this great city…. Someone I could trust and who would jump into a burning building to save me if necessary… Or so I thought. And perhaps that's why, more than watching Eric sleep with someone else… it hurt to know that it was with Laura. Almost eight billion people in the world, and he chose to cheat on me with my best friend. Honestly, that's what has been taking away my sleep… who knows how long they're stabbing me in the back like that. But now that she's standing in front of me, looking at me with a cold expression… I can't help but feel a shiver run down my spine. She's with her arms crossed, looking down like she feels sorry for me. And her voice is also harsh as she says, “We need to talk.” Laura tucks a lock of her red hair behind her ears, which is wearing an extremely familiar earring… A blue topaz earring that I gave her because my boyfriend said it didn't suit me… that something more delicate and modest would enhance my beauty better. I wrinkle my lips. True is, there's nothing to talk about. There's nothing that she could say to make me forgive her — or Eric. Actually, from the expression on her face, she doesn't seem to be looking for apologies, or willing to say how sorry she is… And that just makes my blood boil even more. “We're at work now.” I say firmly and watch as her lips move slightly in a snarky smile that I don't recognize. It's hard to believe that I never noticed this before. Laura is a very beautiful woman, truly. She has red hair that matches her fair skin and big eyes… no wonder the earrings matched her so well… And even though she wears lots of make-up, knee-length skirts, and low-cut blouses, always very well-dressed, there's nothing indecent in her appearance or gestures, but it's things that Eric was always pointed to be slutty. Now that I think about it, Eric was always complimenting her, wasn't he? Comparing us, saying that the things didn't suit me looked good on Laura… Like those damn earrings — the earrings Eric himself suggested I give her. “It's important.” Laura says, raising an eyebrow, sounding so mean I really can't recognize her… I didn't even know she could use a tone like that. Taking a sharp breath, I relax my back in the chair, massaging the bridge of my nose. Argh, I already feel so tired, and it's not even the start of the day. “Fine.” I get up abruptly, walking past her, saying low tone, “You have ten minutes.” Laura looks at me scornfully and passes me, walking down the short hallway until she opens the door of an empty meeting room. She doesn't wait for me to enter, just leaves it open for me to pass through. And as I enter the room and close the door, I can already hear her voice telling me, “I want you to break up with Eric.” I can't help a sarcastic laugh escaping my throat — which causes her expression to close. “We should have told you a long time ago, but Eric was unsure…. Anyway, since you saw it with your own eyes, you must know what's going on.” She raises an eyebrow, with a cocky smile. “Oh, yes… You were riding my boyfriend.” I say in the same sarcastic tone, crossing my arms…. Honestly, I can't believe this bitch! “That wouldn't have happened if you hadn't held your virginity so tightly, Angelee.” She lets out a laugh, leaning against the table, making the curves of her body look seductive, “What you didn't want to give, he looked elsewhere.” I open my lips, but no words escape through them… no sighs, no sounds… nothing. I'm simply too shocked to argue… Wait, she's saying I didn't want to? It's sounds like it's my fault that I kept my virginity during this four-year relationship! “You know the reason I didn't sleep with Eric.” I say offended, my throat narrowing to the point of making my voice squeaky, “His family is conservative…. They don't accept sex before marriage! His mother has always been so good to me, we didn't want to let her down-” “Isn't that just an excuse?” Laura interrupts me with a teasing laugh, “Men have needs, Angelee…. You should have known he would look for someone else. Isn't that obvious?” “So this is my fault?” I ask indignantly. “You betrayed me and, somehow, I'm the one at fault?” “Whose else would it be, if not yours?” She finally disentangles herself from the table, walking slowly towards me, making her damn red heels tap the floor. “But you're right…. His mother is so good to you, and that's why Eric was unable to end this boring relationship.” Boring…? I have devoted myself totally to him — \*to his family\* — for all these years…. For this? Honestly, I feel like a complete idiot. “Break up with him…! Don't you see that you're in the middle of us, Angelee? Eric is very considerate of your feelings, so he was afraid to break up, but you should have a little more self-respect and get out, don't you think?” It's my turn to let out a sarcastic laugh, looking at Laura with extreme disdain, “Really? Then make yourself comfortable… Maybe he didn't tell you, but my relationship with him ended the moment I saw you on top of him.” Laura looks surprised, but I don't allow that reaction to stop me from adding, “Yes, that’s right… the path is free for both of you.” I look at the clock on my wrist and raise my eyes to her again, “Your ten minutes are up.” As I'm turning around, taking a step towards the door, I feel Laura's hand grip my arm firmly and force me to look at her. She says in an even harsher voice, “You're going to lie like that…? Eric told me, you really are a shameless-” “Shameless?” I raise my eyebrows, my eyes widening slightly, “You're the one sleeping with someone else's boyfriend, and I'm the shameless?” Laura's eyes look sharp, ready to cut me into a thousand pieces. “Yes, you're the shameless, self-respectless one!” She says in between, “Because even though you see that he's with me, you're still at his feet. He won't start a family with you.” Laura brings her hand to her belly, caressing it gently, “But with me.” I open my lips, but am too stunned to understand what she's really trying to say- “Yes, that's right. I'm pregnant with Eric's child.” Her words took me by surprise and hit me like a punch in the gut. “This boring relationship you have with Eric is nothing compared to the little one in my tummy.” My lungs force me to expel the air I'd trapped in them, but somehow, I manage to breathe again, deeply, inflating them once more. “Look, I don't know what Eric told you, but I'm definitely not at his feet. I made it very clear that things are over between us…” I lower my eyes, looking at the affectionate way in which Laura caresses her own belly…. And it infuriates me deeply. My vision turns practically red, blurred from the angry tears that threaten to wet my eyes. “Don't worry, I don't intend to interfere with you two.” I lift my chin, glaring back at her, adding snidely, “In fact, I hope you two disappear from my life.” I pull my arm sharply, causing her to loosen her grip on my skin, and turn away, holding firmly onto the doorknob. Taking another deep breath, I add, saying what hope to be the last words I'll ever address to these traitors… and ending for all the friendship that has lasted seven years — “I wish you both good luck.” And just like that, I closed the door, felling my throat narrows… and an unexpected tear ran down my cheek. I try to wipe it away quickly, but it seems a useless effort because, in the next instant, I feel another tear — and another. But… Why? I try to use my hands to stop them, but my eyes feel like waterfalls…. “Angel?” I hear the worried voice call to me, and I rest my wet eyes on him, at the same instant his comforting cologne hits my nostrils. \*Julian has arrived.\*



**07 — We can’t do this...**

“Are you feeling better?” Julian's voice is soft and brings a cozy warmth to my chest, as does the mug between my hands. I lift my eyes, staring at his worried expression. He's standing by the door, holding the doorknob with his big hands that make it practically disappear. After he saw me crying, Julian brought me quickly into his office. The blinds were down, so no one could see how I was crying, even though the floor was really crowded. Honestly, I feel so embarrassed for crying at work… But I simply couldn't help it. Knowing that Laura is pregnant… that she said things so mean… It really hit hard… But I wipe my tears away and give him a comforting smile, clutching the cup in my hands… a delicious coffee that Julian picked up in an attempt to comfort me. He closes the door and approaches me slowly, but his steps are wide, so it only takes a few secs before he's sitting down beside me. His body is so big that it seems to take up the whole couch…. And I feel his arm brush against mine, making me hold my breath. It might have been a subconscious response to Julian's scent, which I've been noticing with increasing frequency… Still, it's a comforting smell, one that calms my nerves. “What happened?” He asks, looking at me serious, “And don’t say that nothing happened because I know you.” I crunch my lips, taking a deep breath. “Laura… We had a conversation.” “You confronted her?” Julian asks with a surprised expression. “It was more… her confronting me, actually.” I face my hands, too embarrassed to raise my gaze, “She told me she's … pregnant.” “Pregnant?” Julian frowns, and gives a dry laugh. “Really? Huh.” I glare at him, a bit annoyed at the light-hearted way he took the information, “Yeah. She wanted me to clear the patch for them.” “But aren't you done with that bastard already?” Julian crosses his arms, clenching his teeth tightly, making his jaw muscles bulge at the beard that's starting to grow. “Yeah.” I sigh, taking a sip of the strong coffee, feeling the taste bring some sense to my foggy mind. He opens his lips to search for the words, which seem to have been lost on his tongue. Then an unexpected question echoes through my ears, bringing a stabbing pain in my chest, “Do you still love him?” Julian still looks at my face, I can feel it… And this makes me even more anxious. “I did love him… At least, that's what I believe.” I place the cup on the table, then turn my body toward him, though my eyes remain on my hands, on top of my lap. “But I'm not crying because I ended my relationship, or because Laura is pregnant with his child. It's just that… for four years, I tried hard to fit his standards, to be good enough…” “You don't have to change yourself to please other people, Angel…” Julian leans toward me and takes my face gently, stroking my cheek with his thumb. “You've always been wonderful; you don't need to belittle yourself to fit his low standards.” “I couldn't see that… not until the truth was before my eyes, until I saw him screwing my best friend. Just… I think that more than being angry at Eric and Laura for stabbing me in the back like that, I’m angry at myself for allowing things to get to this point… to the point that I changed and deprived myself to please someone else.” “It's not your fault.” He says softly, running his thumb across my ear. “Even if you say so, I can't get rid of the feeling that I've lost myself for nothing. That's why I want to get back everything I've allowed to be taken from me.” The words come out hoarsely, and I snuggle into his touch, raising my eyes to his, which seem to glow particularly bright right now. “But this isn't the way… Do you really want to lose your virginity because he cheated on you like that? He’s not worth it, Angel.” “I already said I'm not doing this for him…” I interrupt him, feeling my stomach twist. “Look, I just don't want you to regret it later-” “Regret?” I frown, studying the conflicted expression on his face. “Yes… I mean, you were angry, in a moment of fragility, and I shouldn't have…” He begins, pulling away suddenly, making me feel in the middle of a cold winter. I stare deeply into Julian's green eyes, searching for the words that have completely disappeared from my mouth. My lips open and close, but no sound escapes through them. However, a shiver invades my body when I notice that he's looking at my lips… “Do you regret kissing me?” My question seems to baffle him because he brings his hand to the back of his neck, shrinking his lips. Of course, the possibility crossed my mind. I knew Julian might regret it, but still, hearing it makes me somewhat disappointed. I say firmly, drawing his eyes to my lips again, “I don't regret it, Julian… I meant every word and enjoyed every touch.” “Don't say things like that… You know it's complicated.” “It doesn't have to be. You're used to having one-night stands, why couldn't you have one with me?” Crossing my arms, I feel my face burn from the pride that has been wounded too many times in such a short period. “I know I'm not your type, but…” “Who said that?” He raises an eyebrow. “No one has to say, Julian. Just look at Cathy.” I try to control myself, but her name escapes with a certain resentment, like it's too bitter. And I hate how that makes me sound because the smile that rises on his lips shows that he's enjoying himself. “I'm not sure where you got this, but how are you saying that you're not my type? I thought I was pretty clear yesterday that you weren't the problem.” He suppresses his smile, probably because I'm pouting. “Is this because of Cathy?” “W- Why would it be?” My voice comes out thinner than I expected, and that surprises even myself. “I don't mind you seeing Cathy, or other women…” “Oh, really?” He leans toward me, making me wriggle uncomfortably on the couch. I notice that one of his hands is resting exactly beside my thighs, “But I'm definitely not with Cathy, or any other woman.” “Of course you're not, you've never committed to anyone…” My lips are faster than reason, and I immediately regret saying that. My chest freezes at the possibility of having hurt him, and I spy his expression with the corner of my eyes. To my surprise, there's still a smug smile on his mouth. “Exactly. I'm used to having flings, but you're different, Angel. You've committed yourself to Eric for years. And yes, he's an asshole, but do you really want to lose your virginity with someone like me?” “What's wrong with you? You've never let me down, and didn’t get my ex best-friend pregnant… This simple fact makes you much better than that bastard.” I look away, sighing sharply. Julian's eyes become tender and soft. “But all right, I understand that I showed up at an inopportune moment and asked something like that when you already had plans. But I'm really not doing this rashly.” “I didn't have plans.” He tilts his head slightly, looking at me, still amused. “But Cathy…” “Well, I didn't call her.” Julian interrupts me, bringing the hand that's not resting on the couch up to my wrist, running his fingertips lightly, like a feather rubbing against my skin. I look away, nervous. But the words return, stubbornly, taking a life of their own as they burst from my lips, “Really? For someone who had no plans, I assume you enjoyed yourself quite a bit… While I had to relieve by myself, as usual.” His low, husky laugh is like melody to my ears, and it makes me let my guard down slightly, as his fingers run up my arm, “I told you it’s not like that. Cathy left right after you did. She didn't even get into my apartment.” I hold the air in my lungs and look up at him again, with clear surprise shining in my eyes, “Really?” “What do you think of me?” Julian wrinkles his lips, fighting the smile that wishes to break out at the corner of them. “I've done by myself too, you know.” My eyes drop and seek his lap, and I only realize that I'm staring at the bundle in his pants because Julian's hand is on my face, stroking my cheek softly, making me look at his eyes again. “I didn't sleep with Cathy, or \*any other woman\*, yesterday…” Julian adds in a whisper, sliding his thumb down my jaw to my chin, “I also had to relieve on my own, thinking about you… And you have no idea how long it's been since I did that.” I bite my lips, and that draws Julian's green eyes to my mouth. “But it's better this way… You, me — \*we\*… can’t do this.” He pulls away, and the warmth of his hand and body misses me again, to the point where my chest tightens. “Well, unfortunately, we have a meeting in half an hour…” I watch him get up, but before completely turns away, I see that Julian still has a hard-on in his pants… And my mouth goes suddenly dry. Julian cleans his throat, probably feeling my gaze piercing his body, “Are you okay to attend it? You can leave if you're not feeling well.” “No, it’s okay… I'll be there.” “Okay, right… Good.” Julian walks away, pretending to pay attention to some papers on his desk. A smile rises on my lips, seeing the way he's flushed and trying so hard to resist the desire. All right, Julian… Let's see how long you're able to resist.",1,1745840276.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1k9tdfi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9tdfi,Kendu army never stops,"Sestina 1: The Spirit of Kendu 

The memecoin breathes through community,
No trick or secret, no false rise —
Only spirit, only strength,
Even when the fields run red,
We forge ahead, hammering fate,
Clutching each living dream.

We are the keepers of the dream,
The flame guarded by community,
Our hands calloused as we forge,
Not to mimic, but to rise,
Even as others fall into red,
We march on by sheer strength.

See the monuments of strength,
Cast in the iron of a dream,
When every banner is painted in red,
It is not fear but community
That teaches broken bones to rise,
That teaches weary hearts to forge.

Oh, how we forge,
How we hammer out new strength,
How we tremble but still rise,
Holding the tattered map of a dream,
Bound by nothing but community,
Drenched, but undrowned, in red.

The rivers run deep and red,
Still, every blow we forge
cements our eternal community,
builds our impossible strength,
shields the bones of our dream,
singing one hymn: rise.

Rise, and rise, and rise!
The sun glows not bloodless but red;
It is the lifeblood of our dream
that we choose to forge,
that we choose by strength,
that we bind in community.

(Envoi)
We forge a future for community.
We spill no red for nothing — only for strength.
The dream shall rise and crown us whole.

Sestina II: The Creations of Kendu

We drink deep of Kendu’s energy,
We sip the sacred Brazilian brew,
We wear the anonymous mask,
We paint our tales in mighty murals,
We roll the dice inside the game,
We shape the world by patient craft.

Every new artifact is a craft,
Born of wild, furious energy,
From coffee to potion to strategic game,
To the prophet’s waiting brew,
To masks carved in shadowy murals,
Every mark, every cry behind the mask.

Through the iron grin of the mask,
We wield the old arts of craft,
Our banners blazing with fresh murals,
Blazing with high-voltage energy,
Our courage steeped like a stormy brew,
Ready to leap from the boards of the game.

Within each careful game,
Within each hidden mask,
There bubbles the deep brew,
Boiled in the cauldron of craft,
Fed by endless, raucous energy,
Glowing neon upon the city’s murals.

And the world shall see these murals,
Not as mere paintings, but as games,
As battles fueled by pure energy,
As secrets whispered through a mask,
As victories sung through the loom of craft,
As toasts raised in the froth of brew.

So pour the brew, light the murals,
Summon the craft, cast the game,
Don the mask — and awaken the energy.



Sestina III: The Future of Kendu



We shall cross into the billion,
A flame igniting from hidden fire,
A tribute to relentless strength,
Carved by the hand of destiny,
Unfolding in inevitable rise,
Written in the scrolls of time.

There will come a time
when Kendu’s name weighs a billion,
when every soul can feel the rise,
like a blade of pure fire,
when the call of destiny
burns brighter than any strength.

We have already proven our strength,
Bled into the soil of time,
Bound our swords to destiny,
Dared to dream beyond the first billion,
Nursed our own secret fire,
Promised ourselves we would rise.

And we shall surely rise,
not by accident, but by earned strength,
with every mural and every fire,
through every patient passage of time,
until the world itself grants a billion
salutes to our chosen destiny.

Mark my words — destiny
has no pity and no pause. You rise
or you fall. But we are sworn to the billion.
Sworn through strength,
tempered through time,
tempered through relentless fire.

Let the doubters fear the fire.
Let them whisper against our destiny.
We are the people of time and strength,
The ones who forever rise,
Who demand not pennies, but a billion,
Carved in stone by patient time.

(Envoi)
Through fire, through strength, through all time,
We rise toward destiny,
We hold the billion not in hope — but in hand.

I can't really tell whats behind the look but I've noticed more than once. I'm thinking in trying to see what are these looks about by initiating casual conversation and see if we can go for a coffee or something outside of volunteering. 

I confess I've looked him up and know he is 20 years older than me - I'm in my mid 30s. I don't know anything about his family situation but he doesn't not wear a wedding ring.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! 💪

Imagine this: You wake up, and instead of facing the usual mountain of *to-dos*, you click a button, and BAM! Your day is magically organized. Sounds dreamy, right? 😍

Let’s be real. We all have those daily tasks that eat away at our time like they’re participating in an Olympic sport. If you could wave a magic wand (or maybe just a *really* good app), what would you choose to automate? Here are a few contenders:

- **Meal prepping:** Ever spent hours trying to find inspiration for dinner, only to end up staring blankly at the fridge? What if a meal prep robot could whip up healthy meals for you? Just a few taps, and you’re set for the week! 🍜
  
- **Exercise reminders:** Wouldn’t it be cool if a little voice popped up saying, “Hey you! Time for those squats!” instead of the *perpetual scrolling* on your phone? A little nudge could make a BIG difference. 🏋️‍♂️

- **Email sorting:** If only your emails could magically organize themselves! A filter that knows your stress levels and prioritizes the important stuff? Yes, please! 📧

- **Cleaning the house:** Okay, let’s be honest—who actually enjoys doing the dishes? If I could program a robot to handle the chores, I’d be free to binge-watch my *current obsession* without feeling guilty! 😂

- **Commute optimization:** Imagine a personal assistant (or a really smart map app) that tells you the fastest route to work based on real-time traffic. Less time sitting in gridlock means more time for coffee and self-care! ☕

And speaking of self-care, isn't it crazy how we often don’t find time for things we truly enjoy? I mean, who wouldn't want to trade a few minutes of *adulting* for more time with our favorite hobbies? 🎨📚

So, let’s get the wheels turning. If you could hit the *automate button* on *one task* to free up your time, what would it be? 

Because let’s face it, life’s too short to spend our precious time on mundane tasks when there’s a world of adventures waiting! 🌍✨",1,1745839582.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I’m a master’s student currently doing my internship at a luxury hotel in France. I chose this opportunity to experience how French hotels operate and to improve my French, which is still not fluent. Before this, I worked as a receptionist at one of the largest international hotel chains (H).

However, for this internship, I’ve found the work environment quite inefficient (They use Opera Cloud, which are crazy slow and inefficient imo) but despite my role, I’ve mostly been assigned back-office tasks, anything with international client or sent running errands.

I do understand that my limited French may be a factor, but honestly, **I don’t miss being constantly blamed by other departments, dealing with billing issues, or being afraid I’ll have to pay for mistakes that aren’t always mine.**

Previously, I did a management internship and enjoyed it much more—structured 9-to-5 days, the ability to enjoy a coffee at my desk, proper lunch breaks, coloring and styling my hair however i wanted. 

Now I’m considering changing my internship. Do you think I should stay and try to make the most of it, or is it reasonable to look for a better fit? Back then I used to enjoy being in reception, time fly, if everything is OK is not technically a super difficult job, theres always something new, everyone depend on you-- it felt nice. But now that Im way older I don't think I miss it. 

PS: I felt like.. I can't quit because they gave me this opportunity (its hard for non-french speaker to got intern position in front desk), and it will be good for my CV since I showed I worked in french hotel ? but idk",3,1745839384.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,1.0,False
1k9t4d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1k9t4d5/day_8_my_journey_so_far/,Day 8: My journey so far,"So some months ago a colleague at work that went decaf hinted on this so it had stayed with me ever since. 

I have been consuming 1-3 cups of coffee per day since I was 17, so nearly 15 years. Two months ago I had a huge anxiety attack and I somehow felt that coffee had 50% of the fault. I have always suffered of anxiety so it was worth a try. 

I started by going down to 1 cup per day for 2 weeks. Then I went down to half a cup 3 days per week, then half a cup every day and last week I finally made the leap to no caffeine. 

Day 1 and 2 I had some rebound headache, I just took some pills. To deal with the withdrawal and ""itch"" to drink, I have drunk decaf coffee 3 days in the mornings and I upped my sugar intake a little bit to treat myself. 

The main benefit so far is that I **sleep better and more with less trouble**. **My anxiety has gone down like 40%**, which is really good, just for one week. I have started having A LOT of dreams, like 2 or 3 times more dreams than I used to have. My **energy levels now are very stable**. I do not have breakdowns in the afternoon, which has been really good to enjoy my family's company.

Something that hasn't gone so well is that I have retracted myself from drinking coffee and from all situations that are prone to coffee to avoid temptation. I think I will take decaf coffee to work from now on. 

Another pitfall has been feeling kind of groggy in the mornings. I am still to find a way to ""kick"" myself in the morning, even if it is just with a psychological trick. 

Thanks for this sub who encouraged me a lot to take this last leap. I might update if I see more changes as time goes on.

1k9t2rf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k9t2rf/explore_if_the_stanley_french_press_coffee_maker/,Explore if the Stanley French Press Coffee Maker is worth the hype review,"The Stanley 10-02345-026 French Press is like a camping buddy I never knew I needed. A few weeks ago, I took this sleek all-in-one coffee press along with me on a weekend camping trip. Among the trees and chilly mornings, having a warm cup of coffee became more than just an activity—it was an experience. This 32-ounce stainless steel wonder isn’t just about brewing coffee; it boils water, cooks soup, and withstands just about anything I throw at it. Here’s my honest breakdown of using it every day, both on the trails and at home.

**Functionality That Fits Into Your Backpack**  
Having loads of camp gear is annoying, so I immediately appreciated the compact design of this coffee press. The foldable locking pot handle was a game changer—after I packed everything else into my bag, the press slid in neatly without gobbling up the remaining space. I even noticed that it fits a small container of ground coffee inside. It's truly designed with minimalism in mind, and for someone who loves keeping things streamlined, it felt like a win.  

[Snag your Stanley 10-02345-026 French Press deal on Amazon now!](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0csf4dmyl/)  

**Tough as Nails with Timeless Durability**  
Durability is one feature that matters most for any outdoor product in my eyes. This press is built with tough, BPA-free 18/8 stainless steel, which Stanley claims is nearly indestructible. While I didn’t drive a truck over it, I did drop it a couple of times onto rocky terrain—it survived with barely a scrape. It quickly heated water over the campfire, and my biggest worry (warped metal) didn’t happen at all. Even though I’ve used it regularly at home on my stove since the trip, it still looks as clean and sturdy as day one. The long lifespan this product promises seems pretty legit so far.  

**Brewing Coffee the Stanley Way**  
For a French press, the whole boiling and brewing process couldn’t get simpler. I boiled water right in the pot, added coarsely-ground coffee, and pushed down the plunger. Its reusable BPA-free nylon filter did an excellent job keeping coffee grounds at the bottom. My biggest relief? No gritty coffee ruining my morning sip! It also doubles as a boiling pot if you want some hot soup or oatmeal, which I tried and liked during a rainy morning in the woods. Versatility is absolutely one of this press’s standout traits.  

**Positives**  
Here are a few highlights that make this product stand out:  
- Compact, space-saving design with a foldable handle.  
- Multipurpose functionality: boils water, cooks, and brews coffee.  
- Built-in reusable filter eliminates waste from single-use paper filters.  

**Caveats**  
However, there were some downsides I noticed:  
- The stainless steel body gets hot quickly, so without good gloves, handling it could be risky.  
- Weight-wise, it’s a tad heavy for ultra-light backpackers, though fine for car camping or short hikes.  

**Competing Products**  
During my research, I compared this press with GSI Outdoors JavaPress and AeroPress Go. Both are geared toward portable coffee brewing, but Stanley’s version offers a versatility edge by doubling as a cooking pot and being stove-friendly. With the AeroPress, you’re limited to just coffee, and GSI doesn’t have the robust durability of the stainless steel here. However, AeroPress Go is far lighter, making it a better fit for those who prioritize weight over added functions.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
Speaking of cost-effectiveness, the price of this French press feels like a smart investment for what it delivers. With features that cater equally to coffee fans and camping enthusiasts, you’re getting value out of its multipurpose utility. As someone whose gear budget isn’t limitless, I see this as a gear piece that pulls its weight in more ways than one.

I've been trying to get an entry-level job in retail or something similar in Greater London for the past 2 months, but I haven't had any luck so far.

I do have experience working in three different places before – a coffee shop, a restaurant, and a fast food place, so I thought that would help. But I'm starting to wonder if I'm doing something wrong. I've applied to maybe more than 200-300 listings and gone to 40-50 interviews as well. 

Could anyone give me some advice? Am I missing something? Also, are there any websites or job boards you'd recommend for this kind of work in London?

Really appreciate any tips or help. Thanks in advance.",0,1745839008.0,AskUK,2,0.5,False
1k9szwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianmedschool/comments/1k9szwn/a_review_of_btroffline/,A review of BTR-Offline,"I received DMs about my experience at Chennai BTR after I'd asked for feedback on this subreddit on how to make the most of it (which I didn't get).

So I thought this post might benefit those who would be attending subsequent sessions hereon.

Background: I completed internship around 6 months ago. I only started proper prep from after internship, so it definitely wasn't enough time, I'm a Marrow user plan C and I didn't complete the main videos, I went directly to revision videos.

I didn't know much about BTR until a friend told me about these offline sessions, I didn't know anything about what the teaching style would be. I did know that I had to complete at least 1 revision before attending BTR, otherwise I wouldn't understand anything. So i registered thinking it would be a good 2nd revison for mostly high yield content.

So I did manage to complete max subjects before attending the course, at least my weakest ones.

The course itself is VERY hectic. It's 9am-9:30pm with only 30min lunch and 15min snack breaks. If you need to use the washroom, you're gonna have to do it at the risk of missing a couple minutes of class.

Zainab ma'am's stamina has to be appreciated, the amount of energy she has to just keep going and going. If you're the kidn of person who listened to classes in MBBS, you might be able to pay attention to most, but if you weren't, it will take quite some effort.

But the experience was totally worth it, ma'am's mnemonics and teaching style is amazing, I would recommend it to my fellow mates.

Some things to note:

1. You should ideally have finished 1 revision, at least, either from online BTR or whatever material you are using. I used Marrow and when it comes to the content, it's not significantly different. Ma'am does give useful memory cues though, which I could add on to whichever ones I'd made (and they're hilarious).

2. Compared to online BTR, fewer points are covered (obviously, due to time constraints). My friend was with me, they did online BTR so we could compare. But I think most of the high yield topics are done.

3. A workbook is given (unannotated) which is really useful for us to write down those mnemonics.

4. Bring food. Bring snacks. It's okay to eat during class, ma'am won't mind, she's always got coffee with her too. And 30mins is hardly enough for you to order lunch in time for you to eat unless someone's bringing it to you from home or you're ordering in advance.

5. It's good to go with a friend or two so that you aren't alone. There's gonna be 1.5k+ people. It can be intimidating.

6. Getting front row seats will be tough, there are people who arrive to the class 2hrs in advance to get front seats.

7. Sleep after class ends. No point studying when you're burnt out. Just come fresh the next day and be ready to listen.

If anyone have more doubts, I'm happy to answer. And also if others attending offline BTRs I would love to hear from your side too.",17,1745838949.0,indianmedschool,11,0.95,False

1k9sydd,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1k9sydd/autism_and_socialism/,Autism and Socialism,"Big disclaimer: This post is not based on what Socialism can be, or whay it should be, but instead on my personal experience and experience of people of the generations of my parents and grandparents who I knew back in the country where I was born, Soviet Union.

Short verdict: Not recommended.

And this is because of two problems, minor and major.

Minor one: As many know, Socialism is basically an ideology where collectivism is seen as more important than individualism. This of course leads to situations where individualism is heavily oppresed, and we, Autistic people, are scientifically proven to be people who do not blindly share the majority views mostly, and who have much more severe emotions about injustice and limitation of rights, thus for us the fact that we have to submit to the majority opinion, especially if by force, is even worse than for NT's.

How it was in the Soviet Union - if you speak agaisnt the Socialism, if you question that this Socialism you see, the one that is created by the Soviet government, is the right one, if you overall dare to question the collective feeling of ""this is The Socialism"" - depending on period you could get to prison, labor camp or mental institution. At best, you could be forced to move 100+ km away from major cities, which basically meant that you will have to have low level job and live in bad conditions. Even in the US, imagine being forced to live (and work - in the USSR you couldn't work in the city where you are not registered as its inhabitant) 80 miles away from any major city, from NYC and Seattle to Dallas and Boulder, nice career opportunities around? And in 1970s?

So you had to conform to the majority a lot. But let's say you don't say a thing about the Communist regime around, and just try to ignore the politics. Party head at your factory or university tells ""hey, tomorrow, on saturday, we have a rally for the oppressed people of Congo, then 6 hours of rowk with salary being donated to communist party of Congo."" ""No"" say you, ""I wanted to visit my mother"". You didn't violate any law, all good... until you need to check how is it going with the line for ""free"" apartment that you are to receive from your factory. The line is about 10-20 years long though, nad you came to.. surprise, Party committee of your factory, ans ask this. ""Well"" sayus the party head there ""you are in the line and it's moving, however now to irs front are moved the workers who have the best class consciousness and who worked for the poor oppressed people of Congo, and your personal post is moved half a year back, but don't worry, it's guaranteed that one day you will receive your apartment."" Like this, and this is not a fantasy, this is how it actually was to live there.

But, as I said, this is a lesser problem - often one could just (painfully) spit one his own ideals and just stand for a few hours on some 7th of November (anniversary of the russian revolution) with a portrtait of Lenin, and be marked as a ""good Communist"" by the officials.

But there was a bigger problem for Autistic people - how to get something, foods, clothes, electronics. And if you will now tell me ""go to the store"" it will be nothing but laugh. In stores, even if we wil ltake 1960s or 1970s, often was a very bare minimum of food products, usally without meat at all and without fresh fruit and vegetables, clothes were often in huge deficit, and from electronics you could buy something that was outdated 15 years ago in the US or Germany already, like grampohone in 1970s. Any nice thing, be it records of western rock bands or jeans, were just not available officially and thus they were never present in the stores. Even worse - if you need some service be it shoes repair (it was very common because buing new ones was expensive, and hard to find a good model) or water leak in your house, you often had a choice between either waiting indefinitely long and getting a mediocre service (if you just call the the official service line - because they had no competition at all) or, if you knew someone, you coudl pay them to do it. The same with getting meat, fruits, coffee, canned beer, record player, photo film, jeans, Hungarian boots and so on - you had to know somebody who can provide you those.

And this is a huge pain. For me for example, I can't just pretend I like some person just because they sell something that I need. I don't have it easy with casual socializing, networking and so on - but back then this was the majr process of finding peopel who could you supply you with something beyond very minimal level. Yes, somebody can be happy with oatmeal porridge and leaking shoes forever but this is not even anti-consumerism, it's idiocy, to buy overpticed low scale goods because it's hard to get anything of decent quality. In Soviet system one had, to get almost anything, to be a very social person, to befriend countless shop assistants, butchers and people liek this, who knew this and thus who were proud and arrogant (they had rare good - you had to ask them). I hardly see how could an autistic person deal with such a social system.",0,1745838796.0,autism,5,0.4,False

My Breville Barista Pro (turning 3 years old) stops in 5 seconds with pump gruntling on the last 2-3 seconds and then ended with 3 beeps.

I'm started getting crazy trying to have my coffee back from last week.

Anyway, here is the detailed issue:
1. Brewing stops in 5 seconds with pump gruntling, once it stops, the 3 way solenoid is buzzing moderately for about 1+2 mins and giving a click sound before it stops
2. Hot water does pretty much the same as above
3. Steam stops in 5 seconds i.e. about 4-5 beats and stops with 3 beeps

So far, no issue with these checks following from Youtube:
1. Flow meter: no air lock and magnetic wheel spins freely, no blockage in its water inlet and outlet.
2. Water tank: no blockage on mesh and water filter has been taken out
3. 3 and 2 way valve & solenoid: no blockage and debris found
4. Thermojet: can see hot water comes out normal (no hiccups)
5. Connector hose and elbow joints: no water leakage and limescale blockout
6. PCB board: no spoilt water leak or burnt component from my visual check, I am reluctant to take out PCB board at this moment
7. Water pump: can see it pumping water

1k9swpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k9swpx/my_dog_returned_after_disappearing_in_the_woods/,My Dog Returned After Disappearing in the Woods. He Came Back...Different.,"I've been debating whether to post this for days now. Part of me thinks writing it all down might help me process what's happening, but another part is terrified that acknowledging it makes it more real. I need to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this. Please. I'm not trying to scare anyone. I genuinely need help understanding what's happening to my dog and to me.

For context, I live in a modest three-bedroom house at the edge of Millfield, backing up to Blackwood Forest. I moved here eight months ago after my relationship with Marcus ended. Five years together, engagement ring picked out, then I found the texts from his coworker. I needed somewhere quiet to rebuild myself, somewhere far from shared memories and mutual friends. Real estate was cheap here because of the ""Millfield Reputation,"" as the locals call it. Three disappearances in the past decade, all ultimately attributed to people getting lost in Blackwood's dense wilderness. The old-timers at the local coffee shop sometimes mention how the Native tribes avoided these woods long before settlers arrived. ""Bad medicine,"" they'd say with knowing glances. I never paid much attention to the folklore. I should have.

It's mostly quiet here except for the occasional hiker passing through to the trails. I've lived alone since the breakup. Just me and Cooper, my four-year-old chocolate Lab mix. The one good thing I took from that relationship.

Cooper has always been the perfect dog. Goofy, affectionate, and smart enough to know when I need space or comfort. He sleeps at the foot of my bed most nights, only moving when the heating kicks on and the floor vents become more appealing. We have our routine: morning walks through the neighborhood, evening walks along the forest edge. He's never shown aggression, never even barked at strangers without good reason.

At least, that was Cooper before.

I first noticed something strange about the forest about a month before Cooper disappeared. We were on our evening walk when I spotted unusual markings on some of the trees near the trail. Not typical trail blazes or graffiti, but intricate symbols carved deep into the bark. They resembled nothing I recognized, though something about them felt strangely familiar, like words on the tip of your tongue that you can't quite recall. Cooper refused to go near those trees, pulling hard on his leash to give them a wide berth. I didn't think much of it then. Animals have better instincts than we do.

It happened nineteen days ago. We were on our evening walk along the trail that borders the forest when a group of deer startled ahead of us. Cooper has always been curious about wildlife, but never one to chase. We'd worked on that extensively when he was a puppy. But this time was different. Something about their sudden movement triggered something in him, and before I could tighten my grip on the leash, he yanked it from my hand and bolted after them into the woods.

I called his name until my voice gave out. I searched until it was too dark to see, using my phone's flashlight to navigate the increasingly dense trees. The forest felt wrong that night. The typical ambient sounds of insects and nocturnal creatures had fallen silent, replaced by what I can only describe as a pulsing silence. A silence that felt alive, watchful. I had to give up when my battery died, promising myself I'd return at first light.

The next two weeks were hell. I put up flyers everywhere, called every shelter within fifty miles, and posted in every local Facebook group. I walked those woods every morning and every evening, expanding my search area each day. I left his favorite blanket and some food at the edge of the forest where he'd disappeared. I took time off work to search. I barely slept.

On day fifteen, Mrs. Abernathy, the elderly woman who lives two blocks over, called. She'd seen my posts and wanted to tell me she thought she'd seen Cooper near the old Wilkins property at the far edge of the woods, about four miles from where he'd disappeared.

Mrs. Abernathy has lived in Millfield her entire life. She's one of those small-town fixtures who knows everything about everyone. Her family had been here since the town's founding, and she often shared stories about Millfield's history. Not the sanitized version in the town brochures, but the dark stories passed down through generations. She was the first person who told me about the Wilkins farm when I moved here.

""The Wilkins place has a history,"" she told me over welcome cookies. ""Old man Wilkins was involved in some strange practices back in the 1920s. They say he brought books back from Europe after the Great War. Started holding meetings in that cellar of his. Then one winter, the entire family vanished. Seven people, gone without a trace. The authorities found... unusual things in that cellar. Nobody's lived there since.""

I'd dismissed it as small-town superstition then. Now her voice on the phone carried a weight that made me uneasy.

""Are you sure it was him?"" I asked, trying not to sound too desperate.

There was an odd pause before she answered. ""Well, it looked like your Cooper... mostly. But something was... off about the way he moved. Like he was being... puppeteered. Thought it was just my eyes playing tricks."" Another pause. ""You be careful if you go looking out there, Alex. Some parts of those woods, they change people. Change animals too.""

I thanked her and immediately drove to the Wilkins property. An abandoned farmhouse that local teens used for parties sometimes. The place always gave me the creeps, but I'd have walked through hell itself to find Cooper.

The property was silent when I arrived, just before sunset. The main house stood decrepit, with boarded windows and peeling paint, surrounded by overgrown fields. As I approached, calling Cooper's name, I noticed the cellar doors were ajar. Just a sliver of darkness between them.

I heard a faint whimper.

Hesitantly, I pulled the doors open. The hinges groaned in protest, and the smell hit me immediately. Damp earth, mold, and something metallic I couldn't place. Underneath it all was a sweetness, sickly and cloying, like fruit beginning to rot. I used my phone light to illuminate stone stairs descending into darkness.

""Cooper?"" I called, my voice echoing. Another whimper, definitely a dog, somewhere below.

I still can't fully explain why I went down those stairs. Anyone who's seen a horror movie would know better. But it was Cooper, I was certain of it, and he sounded hurt.

The cellar was larger than I'd expected, with several rooms branching off a main area. Water dripped somewhere, and my light caught strange markings on the walls. Symbols I didn't recognize, but which sent a chill of recognition through me. They were similar to what I'd seen carved into those trees near my house, but more elaborate, more... complete. They almost seemed to shift when viewed from the corner of my eye, as if rearranging themselves when not directly observed. There were dark stains on the concrete floor that I tried not to think about too much. The air felt thick, almost resistant, as if the darkness itself had substance.

I followed the sound of breathing to the farthest room. The temperature dropped noticeably as I approached, my breath fogging in front of me despite it being early September.

And there was Cooper, huddled in the corner, staring at me with eyes that reflected my light too brightly.

""Cooper! Oh my God!"" I rushed to him, relief overwhelming my caution.

He didn't run to me like I expected. He stayed perfectly still, watching me approach. It was only when I was a few feet away that he slowly stood up. His fur was matted with mud. No, not mud, it was too dark, too thick. And he smelled wrong, like copper and something rotten underneath the earthy scent.

But it was definitely Cooper. Same white chest patch, same notch in his ear from a fence incident last year. When I knelt and held out my hand, he finally came to me, pressing his cold nose against my palm.

I was so overwhelmed with relief that I overlooked the strangeness of finding him in that cellar, of the odd markings on the walls, of the way he kept his head tilted slightly too far to the right. I just wanted to get him home.

The vet couldn't find anything physically wrong with him the next day. She noted he was slightly underweight but otherwise healthy. No injuries, no signs of trauma. She did remark that he was ""unusually calm"" during the examination, which was unlike him. Cooper normally hated the vet.

Dr. Levine had been Cooper's vet since he was a puppy. She knew his typical behavior, which made her concerned expression all the more troubling.

""His vitals are normal, but his pupils are unusually dilated,"" she said, shining a light into Cooper's eyes. He didn't flinch or look away, just stared ahead. ""And his body temperature is lower than I'd expect. Has he been lethargic?""

""Sort of,"" I replied. ""He's been quiet. Not really himself.""

""He might be a bit traumatized from whatever happened,"" she suggested. ""Just give him time to readjust. Keep an eye on him, note any concerning behaviors. Call me immediately if anything changes."" She hesitated, then added, ""You found him in the Wilkins place, right? That old cellar?""

I nodded.

""My grandmother used to tell stories about that place,"" she said, her voice lower. ""Just... watch him closely, okay?""

If only she'd been more specific about what ""concerning behaviors"" might look like.

The first few days, I was just happy to have him back. I attributed his quietness to stress. He wasn't eating much, but the vet said that might take time. He followed me everywhere but kept a strange distance. Always watching, rarely approaching for affection like he used to.

I tried calling my friend Jenna, who'd helped me search for Cooper initially. She'd always been our go-to dog sitter and loved Cooper almost as much as I did. I thought maybe seeing a familiar face might help him readjust.

""He's acting weird,"" I told her over the phone. ""Not like himself at all. Would you mind coming over?""

""Of course,"" she said. ""I'll bring those treats he loves.""

When she arrived that afternoon, Cooper's reaction was disturbing. He backed away, growling low in his throat at the sight of her. Jenna, confused and hurt, tried to approach him slowly.

""Hey buddy, it's just me,"" she cooed, reaching out.

Cooper's growl deepened, taking on that strange layered quality I would become familiar with in the coming days. Jenna froze.

""What was that sound?"" she whispered.

""I don't know,"" I admitted. ""He's been... different since he came back.""

She stayed for only half an hour, visibly unsettled by Cooper's behavior. At the door, she pulled me aside.

""Alex, I don't want to scare you, but that doesn't seem like Cooper,"" she said. ""The way he looked at me... it wasn't him looking out from those eyes.""

""What are you saying?""

""I don't know. Just... be careful, okay? Maybe get a second opinion from another vet.""

It was on the fourth night after his return that I woke to find him standing at the foot of my bed, perfectly still, staring at me. Not lying down, but standing. His eyes caught the faint light from my alarm clock, gleaming too brightly.

""Cooper, buddy? You need to go out?"" I murmured, still half-asleep.

He didn't respond. No tail wag, no shift in posture. Just continued staring.

""Cooper?"" I sat up, fully awake now.

He turned and walked from the room, movements stiff and deliberate. I heard his nails clicking down the hallway, then silence. When I got up to check, he was sitting in the kitchen, facing the back door, motionless again.

I told myself it was nothing. Dogs are weird sometimes. Right?

The next morning, I found him in the same spot, as if he hadn't moved all night. His food bowl remained untouched.

That day, I caught him scratching at the walls, not like a normal dog might when hearing something inside, but methodically, in patterns. When I approached, he stopped immediately and walked away, that same stiff gait.

I tried to call Dr. Levine but was told she was out of town for a conference. The receptionist offered to schedule me with the other vet at the practice, but something stopped me. What would I say? My dog stands still and stares at walls? He walks funny? They'd think I was overreacting.

I should have reached out to someone then. Should have insisted on seeing another vet immediately. But a part of me was afraid of what they might find. Afraid they might want to take Cooper away from me. After spending two weeks thinking I'd lost him forever, I couldn't bear the thought of losing him again, even if this Cooper was... wrong.

A week after his return, the nighttime incidents escalated. I woke to find him not at the foot of my bed, but beside it, his face level with mine, inches away. His eyes were wide, unblinking. And his mouth... this is hard to describe without sounding crazy... his mouth was pulled back too far, exposing all his teeth in what looked like a grotesque approximation of a smile. It wasn't like a normal dog panting. The corners of his mouth were stretched backward in a way that shouldn't be anatomically possible.

I gasped and jerked backward. Cooper didn't move, didn't react to my startled response. Just kept staring, kept ""smiling.""

""Cooper, no,"" I said firmly, using my training voice. ""Go to your bed.""

After what seemed like minutes, he slowly backed away, never breaking eye contact, never closing his mouth. He retreated to the corner of the room where he stood watching me until morning.

I couldn't sleep again that night.

The next day, I noticed other things. The way he would suddenly stand alert, head cocked, listening to something I couldn't hear. The way he avoided his reflection in the hallway mirror. The way he spent hours staring at the same spot on the wall in my office, occasionally emitting a low growl that didn't sound like his voice. Too deep, almost layered, as if multiple throats were producing it.

I searched online for explanations. Could it be some rare form of rabies that the vet had missed? A neurological disorder? Poisoning from something he'd found in the forest? Nothing matched his symptoms exactly. I found a few forum posts from people whose pets had returned from being lost with behavioral changes, but nothing like what Cooper was exhibiting.

I took him back to the vet, who again found nothing physically wrong but suggested a veterinary behaviorist. The earliest appointment was two weeks out. The receptionist must have noticed my distress, because she lowered her voice and said, ""You found him at the Wilkins place, right? My cousin's hunting dog went missing there three years ago. When it came back...""

""What?"" I pressed when she trailed off.

She glanced around, then leaned closer. ""They had to put it down. It started... hurting itself. And then it tried to hurt them.""

That weekend, nine days after Cooper's return, I opened the trash can to find it empty when I knew it had been nearly full. Later that afternoon, I found Cooper in the backyard, hunched over something. When I approached, he growled. A sound that made the hair on my arms stand up. Before reluctantly moving away.

He'd been eating a dead rabbit. But not like a dog normally might. It was... arranged. Splayed out, innards exposed in what looked like a deliberate pattern. The ground around it had what appeared to be symbols scratched into the dirt, similar to what I'd seen in that cellar and on those trees.

I vomited in the bushes.

That night, I locked Cooper in the spare bedroom. I needed one night of uninterrupted sleep to think clearly. At exactly 3:17 AM (I remember checking my phone), I woke to scratching sounds. Not on the bedroom door, but on my bedroom wall. The wall shared with the spare room.

Scratch, scratch, scratch. Pause. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Rhythmic. Deliberate.

I turned on the light. The scratching stopped immediately.

Then I heard it. A sound no dog should be able to make. Words. Not barking that sounded like words, but actual formed words, in a whispered voice that was not Cooper's, not human, but something else entirely.

""Let. Me. In.""

I convinced myself I was dreaming, even as I heard the knob of the spare room door turning. I'd locked it, I was sure I'd locked it.

Morning found Cooper back in his usual spot in the kitchen, facing the back door. The spare room door was still locked. I must have dreamed it all...

Except for the deep scratch marks on the inside of my bedroom wall, exposed where a chunk of drywall had been torn away.

I should have left then. Should have gotten in my car and driven far away. But where would I go? What would happen to Cooper? And some irrational part of me still hoped this was temporary, that my real dog would return to me if I just waited it out.

I called Mrs. Abernathy, the only person who seemed to know anything about the history of this town, of the Wilkins place.

""You found him there, didn't you?"" she asked before I could explain. ""In that cellar.""

""Yes,"" I admitted. ""And now he's... not right. Something's wrong with him.""

She was silent for so long I thought we'd been disconnected.

""Mrs. Abernathy?""

""There were stories,"" she finally said, ""about what old man Wilkins was trying to do down there. Something about opening doors that should stay closed. Calling things through. Things that need... vessels.""

""Vessels?""

""Bodies,"" she clarified. ""To walk around in. My grandmother used to say the Wilkins family didn't vanish. They were... replaced.""

""That's just superstition,"" I said, but my voice lacked conviction.

""Maybe so. But you listen to me, Alex. If your dog isn't your dog anymore, you need to consider what might be wearing his skin now. And why it came home with you.""

Yesterday, things escalated further. I came home from grocery shopping to find Cooper sitting in the center of the living room, surrounded by every photograph in the house. All taken down from walls, removed from frames, and arranged in a spiral around him. In every single one, his image had been scratched out.

And last night... last night was the worst.

I pretended to sleep, keeping my eyes just slightly open, watching. Sure enough, around 2 AM, Cooper entered my room. He didn't walk normally. He moved in a jerking, almost insect-like fashion, his joints bending in ways they shouldn't. He approached the bed slowly, then climbed up with unnatural grace.

I forced myself to keep breathing evenly, fighting against every instinct to run.

He loomed over me, that terrible smile spreading across his face, wider than should be physically possible for a dog. Then he leaned down until his face was directly above mine, his breath smelling of rot and copper.

I couldn't maintain the pretense any longer. My eyes flew open fully, meeting his gaze.

""I know you're not Cooper,"" I whispered. ""What are you?""

The smile grew impossibly wider. Then, slowly, methodically, he began to peel back his lips even further, exposing not just teeth but gums, then what looked like a second set of teeth behind the first.

I scrambled backward, hitting the headboard hard. Cooper, or whatever was wearing Cooper's skin, made that layered growling sound again. Then, in that same whispered voice I'd convinced myself I had imagined:

""We. Found. You.""

I slept in my locked car last night.

This morning, Cooper acted normal. Almost too normal, like the old Cooper, waggling his tail, bringing me his leash. But his eyes... his eyes weren't right. They had always been warm brown, but now they seemed darker, with flecks of something that caught the light wrong.

I packed a bag and drove to my parents' house thirty miles away. I told them Cooper was acting strange and I needed a break. They don't allow pets in their building, so he's still at my house, with enough food and water for a couple of days. I set up a pet camera to watch him.

For the first few hours, he just sat in the kitchen, staring at the back door. Then, an hour ago, he turned and looked directly at the camera. That smile spread across his face again.

He walked to the camera, movements fluid now, nothing like a dog. His face filled the screen, eyes blinking sideways, that impossible smile widening.

""Coming. For. You.""

The feed went dead.

My phone just buzzed with a notification from my home security system. Back door open.

I don't think Cooper is alone anymore. I don't think he ever was, since he came back.

And I don't think whatever came back with him is staying in his body anymore.

If you see a chocolate Lab mix wandering around Millfield, please, please don't approach him. And if he's smiling... run.",4,1745838617.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1k9swkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1k9swkf/the_singularity_chapter_11_intro_the_beigeverse/,[The Singularity] Chapter 11: Intro the Beigeverse,"My vision is suddenly filled with beige. The color looks like a cup of latte and is absolutely everywhere.

 

I'm surprised to find that I'm standing. More specifically, I'm walking. There's no real direction here though, just a vague milky-coffee-like fog that I keep walking through.

 

I look down. Who am I?

 

Okay, I'm still the astronaut floating in the space, but I'm walking. There's gravity here, but it doesn't seem to pull me down like usual. I'm wearing my spacesuit, but my helmet is missing. I want to say it's refreshing but I don't really feel any air enter my lungs and there's not even a breeze against my bare face.

 

""Sol?"" I speak out to the latte-void.

 

I keep walking forward as I wait for a response. No reply comes.

 

""Okay then,"" I say. ""Sol, I can't hear you, but I think I'm having a hallucination. Can you wake me up?"" I look around the beige-universe. Where's this off-white light coming from, anyway?

 

There's no features on the horizon (or any sort of horizon). I stop walking and look around. I check all the angles I can. I can't even see the ground I'm even standing on. There's just beige. If I didn't know any better, I'd say I'm still floating here.

 

It's so damn beige.

 

""Well, this is new,"" I say as I try to blink some dirt out of my eyes. No idea how I got dirt in them; this is one of the reasons why I wear a helmet.

 

I keep blinking but this one particular black dot stays. I have to release my suit’s gloves to rub the dirt out. Wait - that's not dirt. There's something here, or there really. Something darker than the beige.

 

I groan as I walk towards it. ""This isn't going to end good for me. Unless I've already died,"" I say aloud to no one. That's a great thought.

 

Ugh it's so beige, though. I can't tell if my feet are walking straight or not. It's so confusing here.

 

The black dot I see has grown a bit in size. I have no idea how much time I spent walking to it, though. It seems so far away. I stop walking for a second and scan the invisible horizon. I see some other distant dots in the distance.

 

""Oh,"" I say, ""I'm definitely dead, aren't I?"" I wish Sol would just answer me. ""Wake me up, Sol! Hello!""

 

My voice scatters in the trillion directions that exist here in this beigeverse.

 

""Hello?"" I whisper out. I'm not confident that my voice is even carrying here.

 

I feel the ground shake. The beigeverse itself is shaking. I don't feel any atmospheric pressure against my face, but the air itself is shaking. I don't even think there's an atmosphere here, but it's still shaking. It feels like static electricity buzzing all around me and there's a noise growing from it.

 

It sounds like an aircraft taking off as it seems to grow in intensity from every direction. It pierces my brain and burns my synapses.

 

I cover my ears with my suit's gloves. I wish I had my helmet back.

 

With no warning, a new sight appears in the beigeverse. The proportions are epic and on a scale that I can't measure or compare to anything.

 

I'm staring at a gargantuan circle of varying colors. Its center is a red ball, circled by orange, then yellow. The yellow border fades and seamlessly blends into the beige atmosphere. I can’t tell if it’s moving or not since it blends so well.

 

The monstrous orb is in front of me and screams like static. I'm suddenly aware of my heartbeat as it tries to match the rumbling sounds.

 

As my eyes adjust to its size and shape, I see parts of its yellow borders slither and expand into the beige-nothingness.

 

""Oh no,"" I say as I turn around and run. ""No, no, no, no, no.""

 

I sprint away but I feel the rumbling follow me. I have no sense of direction except for a black dot I pick and instinctively run towards. It's so hard to tell where I'm running. I hope I'm running straight.

 

I run for minutes, years, hours, decades, months, or whatever else passes for time around here. Paradoxically, it takes no time and forever before I’m close enough to make sense of the black dot.

 

The black dot is a much smaller orb, around the size of an elephant. It's a swirling black mass covered in some sort of slick oil that constantly flows around itself.

 

I notice the rumbling sound has decreased after I approached this new feature. I think it's close enough for me to reach out and touch it, but there's no depth perception here. I might still be far away. I don’t dare to reach out.

 

I turn around and face the monster-ball. I think the monster is farther away than before, at least. It looks smaller, but it’s impossible to tell. It’s just so massive. Its red center pulsates and sends a shockwave through the orange and yellow borders. The colors blend and shake throughout its entire shape.

 

""Ha!"" I yell at it. ""I got you!""

 

The red circle in the center of the orb disappears. The orange shell fills in the missing red, before the orange disappears too. Then, the monster appears as a fully yellow ball before eventually dissipating into the cream-colored atmosphere.

 

“I guess that worked."" I laugh.

 

Something grabs my leg. I look back and see an oily, black tentacle wrap itself around my leg. It’s coming directly from the blackened mass.

 

""Oh,"" I say as another black, oily tentacle escapes from the orb and wraps itself around my waist.

 

The oily appendages pull me backwards and more tentacles reach out to grab me. In short time, they cover my face and I can no longer see or speak. I see nothing but blackness again as I’m pulled backwards into the elephant-sized black mass.

 

I can feel my body and mind dissipate while I hear the static droning again in the deep recesses of my mind. It feels like it’s changing the settings of my brain.

 

I remember the End of All now. I remember everything, but I know I'll forget it once I wake up the next time.

“Daddy,” Myra called out as she ran down from her bedroom, shrugging on a brown cardigan over her white tee.



At the front door, she struggled to put on her boots as she called out again.



“Daddy, I’m so late...” She looked at her reflection in the entryway mirror as she roughly pulled on her mid-back length, unruly curly hair into a messy bun. She applied some chapsticks to her lips and vainly sent a kiss to her reflection.



“Hey dad, can you??” She started questioning an empty kitchen. There was an eerie silence in the house, so she switched to her heightened sense of hearing; all she heard was the gentle hum of the refrigerator and the slight drips of water from the kitchen faucet.



“Crap!” She exclaimed when she realized no one else was in the house. She pulled out her cell phone and dialled her father’s number while attempting to place two slices of bread to toast.



He answered after the second ring. “Myra?”



“Dad, why didn’t you wake me?” she questioned as she touched the coffee pot to judge how warm the coffee still in it was.



“You’re still home?” He gasped, “Sorry sweetheart, we had a delivery first thing this morning, and I needed to pick up Benji,” He explained just as loud background noises came across the line. “Hold on.”



“Dad... argh!!!”



She pulled down her favourite coffee cup tumbler and poured fresh coffee into it.



“Darling, I’m sorry I didn’t wake you, but we’re busy at the moment. Chat later, okay.”



\*Click\*



“Damnit, dad!” She cursed as she stared down at the disconnected call. “Twenty-one, car-less and hopeless... that’s what I am.”



While trying to calm her racing, frantic thoughts, she smelt her toast starting to burn. She quickly took it out, sighing heavily as she spread some butter on it. “\*I have twenty minutes before classes start, I can shift and run it... but I will be sweaty and hot all morning. Maybe, I can call in for a morning substitute and have a lazy morning or I can simply call in sick.\*""



She leaned against the kitchen island, nibbling on the toast as she wasted time considering her various options. Suddenly, her phone vibrated, and Megan’s name flashed across the screen.



“Hey Bitch.”



“Hi Ho, in need of a ride?” Megan laughed.



“I don’t know how you do that sometimes... but I love you so much right now. How long?” Before she could finish asking, a car horn echoed from outside. “Coming.”



“Don’t you need a man or a toy to achieve that?” She smart-mouthed then hung up.



Myra shook her head as she quickly grabbed her work handbag hanging by the front door and darted out of the house.



“You’re a lifesaver.” Myra greeted in relief as she climbed into Megan’s Range Rover. She leaned over the centre console and kissed Megan on the cheek.



Megan smiled, putting the vehicle into drive, and she sped out of the driveway. “You can repay me by coming to the club tonight.”



Myra attempted to dodge the request by trying to change the topic. “If you’re working tonight, how come you’re awake at this ungodly hour?” Myra teased, looking over at her best friend. She noticed Megan wasn’t wearing any makeup this morning and her natural, pale olive skin shone in the morning sun. She had her jet black hair pulled into a high ponytail, and her sunglasses pushed her bangs away from her face.



“Dad forgot his lunch; I was on the phone with him when your dad was talking to you. So, I thought, \*let me play good samaritan, and maybe I can pressure her to come out tonight\*.” Megan smirked, catching onto Myra’s attempts to avoid the topic.



“Pressure is right.”



“Also, Gallagher’s Carpentry is delivering to the Jamison household, and those wolves could snack on me any day.” Megan sighed dreamily.



Myra smiled wickedly at Megan. “I thought Baron Anderson was snacking on you these days? Isn’t that why he can’t seem to get the part for my Jeep?”



“Hey, a girl needs variety... and it’s not my fault he can’t multitask.”



“A girl needs a chastity belt...” Myra muttered under her breath.



“But I have you.”



Myra faked surprise, “Bitch.”



They soon fell into a comfortable silence as music from Megan’s iPhone played through the car’s speakers. Myra smiled to herself, thinking about their friendship.



Megan has been her best friend since they were 10-year-old when her father first started working for Gallagher’s Carpentry. Both of Megan’s parents are Oxen Shifters, however, Megan was adopted and was every inch a human.



Together with Myrielle, Myra’s older twin sister, they were the three musketeers always getting into trouble, both in and out of school. As they got older, Myrielle pursued Accounting at College, while both Megan and Myra decided to study Education. While Myra completed her training and was now a Second-Grade teacher, Megan had dropped out at the end of their second year. She discovered that dancing paid more money, and the night hours freed up her days.



“How’s Myrielle?”



“Still pregnant and looking more like a beached whale these days... after school, I am going to visit her and take some groceries to her.”



“Married and pregnant. That’s terrifying, but she got herself a hunky guy, so who could blame her.”



“Forget the Jamison wolves snacking on you... Myrielle will eat you first if she heard you talking about Benji like that.”



“Yeah, yeah... mates can be obsessive and protective. I may be human, but mom and dad taught me how to behave around mated pairs.” Megan said off-handedly as she turned onto the street with Myra’s school.



“Here we are... with 3 minutes to spare.” She commented, pulling into the schoolyard.



There were different school-aged children all over the grounds as well as some parents and teachers supervising them before the first bell.



“Thanks, doll. You’re my hero.”



“No problem. You know in the spirit of being a good samaritan, I think I’m going to swing by Frankie’s Garage after I drop off dad’s lunch and get them to hurry up with that part for your Jeep.”



“Just say you have an itch that you want Baron to scratch for you.” Myra sighed, gathering her things. “\*At least one of us would be getting serviced.\*”



“With all those euphemisms for sex, what do you think?” Megan winked.



“Go scratch that itch, babe.”



“Oh, I will. Do have a great day, Miss Myra... and call me before you leave Myrielle’s later.”



They blew kisses at each other just as the first bell rang.







# Chapter Two



\*\*Sloan\*\*



Sloan slid his jacket into place, adjusting his collar and cuffs as he mentally perused his schedule for the day.



""\*Morning sex - checked.\*""



He glanced at the satisfied blonde entangled in his bedsheets through the reflection of the mirror.



""\*Furniture delivery for the Den and my office - on going.\*""



He planned to check on them before leaving for his meetings with surrounding packs and clans within the area.



He had been Pack Alpha for eight months now, ever since his father retired at age sixty. Now, he was responsible for managing the largest and wealthiest multi-species pack in the Seattle area.



Recently, however, a gang of rogues had banded together and have been terrorizing shifters and humans alike. They have been leaving a string of mulled, mutilate and murdered bodies up and down the coastline, crisscrossing different pack and clan territories.



He looked over his appearance once again. His muscles bulged under his crisp white shirt, which stood out against his tanned caramel skin complexion, and his trousers were tailored perfectly over his muscular physique. He glanced at his wavy, black hair pulled into a man bun before brushing his neatly trimmed beard with his hands.



“I am clearly losing my touch if you’re up and dress already.” The blonde purred as she wrapped her hands around his waist and kissed him between the shoulder blades.



“Trust me, Elizabeth... I’m more than capable of getting back into bed with you, but I have pack duties and work to attend to all day.” Sloan responded. However, her gentle caresses that would have aroused him a mere hour ago suddenly seemed to repulse him. Even his wolf spirit unexpectedly growled in disgust at her touch.



“How about I give you something to remember me by until tonight?” She said, walking around him to show off her nude body. He had to mentally school his facial expressions and calm his gag reflex.



“Sorry, but morning sex was more than enough,” Sloan said. He needed to extract himself from her presence; as he was struggling to control his body’s disdain to her sexual advances.



""\*What is happening? Elizabeth’s been my girl for the past year and a half, and I have never felt like this.\*"" He thought, gently removing her hands from his body.



“Sloan!” His brother - Tristan - shouted as he barged into Sloan’s bedroom. “Gallagher’s here. Dad’s overseeing the delivery and installation. Our first clan meeting is on the northern side of the city in thirty minutes...”



Tristan read off from his tablet. He looked up and saw Elizabeth trying to shield her naked body behind Sloan.



“Oh, hey Liz...” He shrugged, picking up her discarded dress and tossing it roughly over to her. Sloan discreetly covered his snort when the dress smacked her in the face.



“Anyway, the Panther clan was attacked last night, three dead, as well as a lone jogging human. The Council of Elders are getting worried; so, they pushed their meeting to 11 am.”



“Shit!” Sloan snapped. “It’s going to be a long-ass day... let me check on Gallagher first, and then we can go. Umm, Elizabeth, I’m not sure about later.” Or ever. He called over his shoulder, grabbing his suit jacket as he exited the room.



“What the hell was that?” Tristan laughed as he ran up to meet with Sloan. At the age of twenty-eight, his brother was only a year younger than Sloan and his complete opposite. Tristan was almost a half foot shorter than Sloan. He kept his sandy brown hair short and styled with excessive hair gel. While Tristan would train with both Sloan and his other Beta, Declan, he was surprisingly strong regardless of him possessing a small body frame.



“I don’t know myself... must be time for a new bed warmer.”



“About fucking time!” Tristan woohooed.



Sloan rolled his eyes at his brother’s reaction as the smell of freshly carved wood filled the foyer. Some pack members were helping with the moving and removal of furniture while their father stood by the opened front door, ordering individuals about.



“Father.”



“Son, I must say your taste has drastically improved.” Theo joked as he pointed to the Library Den. “And Gallagher’s was a wise choice.”



“Mom suggested them... also, thanks for taking over this task,” Sloan stated as they looked at the different pieces being placed together.



The new, already to installed floor-to-ceiling bookcase was being stocked by some females while they rearranged a solid oak desk to sit near the bay windows that overlooked the backyard and provided a cliff drop and sea view.



“We lost three panthers last night,” Sloan stated, turning to his father. The older Sloan got, the more he agreed that he was a carbon copy of his father. Both are identical in height, complexion and mannerism, though his father has been more carefree since retiring.



“Shit... this isn’t how I envisioned your first year as Alpha, son.”



“Me neither,” Sloan said as they walked back to the foyer.



Sloan sensed and ignored Elizabeth as she slowly descended from the second floor. She tried to get his attention but failed. She huffed in frustration and stormed out of the house. “We will see you at the council meeting in a few hours, dad... Tristan, Declan and I are heading over to the Panthers’ territory.”



Sloan can feel the unasked questions his father was dying to ask, but the sound of a motorbike revving filled the air.



“That would be Declan,” Tristan stated the obvious. Sloan rolled his eyes and motioned a pack member over.



“Sally, have someone tend to my rooms... the bed needs to be thoroughly detailed, and the current sheets can be removed and burnt.”



“Yes, Alpha.”



“Wow, burning of sheets? Liz must really be losing her oral skills.” Tristan tested.



Usually, a comment like that will enraged him, but Sloan simply shrugged his shoulder, not caring while their father smiled brightly. Declan walked into the house just as Theo announced.



“It’s beginning.”







# Chapter Three



\*\*Myra\*\*



""\*What a day! And strangely, I’ve been feeling waves of hot spells all day.\*"" Myra thought as she logged a couple of shopping bags up the front step of her twin’s house, with sweat pouring down her back.



Myra had discarded her cardigan earlier in the day, resisting the urge to pant like her vixen spirit.



“Thank goodness another being... please tell me you have come to save me from myself.” Myrielle cried when she opened the front door and pulled Myra in for a tight hug. It was somewhat uncomfortable and difficult to do with her massive pregnant belly in the way.



“Why are you on your feet? You should be on bedrest, sister darling.”



Myrielle pouted while Myra laughed, nodding her head for them to go inside.



“Please don’t tell Benji. Umm, where’s your jeep? You look like a drenched puppy.”



“Thanks for the vote of confidence, sis. As for my jeep, it’s still in the Garage. I wish Megan would stop screwing Baron long enough for him to do his job.” Myra smiled as she placed the shopping bags on the kitchen counter. She then headed straight for the fridge pulling out a bottle of iced cold water.



“I hope I got everything you wanted... thinking about baking a cake in your condition?” Myra quizzed her.



“Ummm...” Myrielle stuttered. She looked guilty before squealing as she unpacking a jar of vanilla frosting and Nutella. “You are a Godsend... hand me that jar of pickles while you’re in the fridge, please?”



“What are you?” Myra started to question as she handed Myrielle the jar while resting the cool bottle against her hot skin.



Myrielle took out a pickle, sucked the juices off it, and then stuck it into the Nutella and the vanilla frosting.



“You wouldn’t?? Oh God, you did.” Myra gagged as Myrielle’s eyes rolled back as she slowly chewed the strange combination. “Your pregnancy cravings are disgusting.”



“Don’t knock it till you try it... by the way, what’s wrong with you?”



“I don’t know... I was fine just before school started this morning. However, about twenty minutes into my first class session, I started feeling uneasy. It’s like I was experiencing hot flashes.”



“Hot flashes??” Myrielle looked at her in confusion, then a smile slowly crept up on her face. “Like in waves? Almost to the point where you feel the need to rip your clothes off and hump every adult male insight?”



“Y-yes? I stood in the freezer section of the grocery store, just basking in the cold air for a solid ten minutes, trying and failing to control the heat radiating off my body.”



Myrielle dropped the pickle and started laughing. At first, Myra stared at her twin in confusion, but the longer, louder and harder Myrielle laughed; her confusion turned to panic.



“Hey, you’ll laugh that pup right out of you. Stop it.”



“It’s not hot flashes, dummy. You’re in heat.”



Myra stared at her twin before laughing herself.



It was now her turn to have one of those gut-busting type of laughter. She grabbed onto her stomach as she doubled over, trying to breathe and control herself.



“Me? In heat? Apart from weird pregnancy cravings, you also have pregnancy brain.” Myra said as tears streamed down her cheeks.



“Trust me. I remembered the first time I went into heat. It was just before Benji and I met...” Myrielle stopped suddenly and grabbed Myra’s shoulders. “Oh my God, your mate! They’re near.”



“I am not in heat... I must be coming down with something. Stop all this crazy nonsense about mates. Geez, misery seriously loves company.”



“I’m so happy for you... you’re gonna be mated.”



“No, I’m getting sick... and possibly wasted... Megan is forcing me to go to the club tonight, and I need a pair of shoes to complement my outfit.”



“In heat and clubbing... stock up on condoms!” Myrielle shouted to Myra’s back as she exited the kitchen.



“Drinks, you horny pregnant weirdo... only drinks and possibly lots of dirty dancing... so please shut up.” Myra rolled her eyes as she entered Myrielle and Benji’s bedroom and headed straight for the closet. Myrielle had a wall of shoes of varying heights and colours.



“Sure... \*drinks\*.”



“You know you’re pregnant right? Some of these shoes should be illegal for someone in your condition.” Myra said, shaking her head.



“You sure you want to borrow a pair?? They’re the reason I’m in this condition.”



Myrielle smiled, brightly as she climbed into the bed, rubbing her protruding stomach while texting someone on her phone.



\*\*\*



\*\*Sloan\*\*



Sloan stood under his shower, letting the cold water cascade down his body as he endeavoured to forget this strange day. Particularly his brief conversation with his father that morning.



\~Memory\~



\*“What do you mean “it’s beginning”?” Sloan asked his father.\*



\*“You will see...” Theo laughed at his son as he walked away, howling with laughter.\*



\~End of memory\~



""\*All day, I’ve been sexually frustrated, and my wolf was just as uneasy and restless. I would think sitting in a meeting with a room filled with the Elders would help stop or curve the surge of sexual hunger I’ve been feeling. I even tried imagining the room engaged in massive orgy, but my hard-on refused to go away.\*"" He thought about his day.



He looked down, and there it was, his continuous erection, hard as a fucking rock.



""\*Maybe I should call Eliz...\*"" Before the thought could complete, his cock deflated, and his wolf growled in dissatisfaction and disgust.



“What do you want from me?” He growled, punching the shower wall in frustration. His knuckles immediately started to bleed before the healing process stopped it. He rinsed the blood off his hands and gazed at the red bruises before they disappeared.



“WHAT?!” He called out angrily as someone briefly tapping on his bathroom door.



“Get dressed, Princess... we’re going clubbing,” Tristan called from the bedroom.



“Yes, my Queen!” He replied, switching off the water. ”\*Random pussy, just what I need.\*""



His wolf once again growled in disgust at the thought. ”\*Shut the fuck up... do you have a better idea?\*""



Forty-five minutes later, Sloan met up with Tristan and Declan in the foyer. They were all dressed in designer suits. Sloan had a dark grey suit with a white button-down shirt opened up at the neck. Tristan opted for a brown suit and a french blue button-down shirt. Declan was in his usual all-black suit and shirt.



Declan was issuing orders to a group of Pack members, all shifters of different species. Each was tasked with protecting the territory’s perimeter, and they were to report anything suspicious.



“Dismissed...” The group saluted him and broke off into pairs as they exited the house.



“Where’s your cockblocker?” Declan asked sweetly, and Tristan snorted.



“Not coming...” Sloan shrugged, using the entryway mirror to tie his hair up into a messy man bun. Tristan threw his arm over his brother’s shoulder.



“He’s finally seen the light... and has returned to the other side.”



“About bloody time, first rounds are on me,” Declan smirked, causing Sloan to roll his eyes at him.



“I know you all didn’t like her, but you don’t need to be so damn happy about it.”



Declan continued like Sloan didn’t speak. “Fucking ecstatic! That wolf is as toxic as the toxic fallout in Chernobyl. I am just glad you are finally free of her poison, and I hoped you welcomed back your balls vigorously.”



“Fuck off.”



“Children, shall we go hunting.” Tristan cheered.",1,1745838518.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1k9svhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1k9svhe/the_singularity_chapter_11_intro_the_beigeverse/,[The Singularity] Chapter 11: Intro the Beigeverse,"My vision is suddenly filled with beige. The color looks like a cup of latte and is absolutely everywhere.

 

I'm surprised to find that I'm standing. More specifically, I'm walking. There's no real direction here though, just a vague milky-coffee-like fog that I keep walking through.

 

I look down. Who am I?

 

Okay, I'm still the astronaut floating in the space, but I'm walking. There's gravity here, but it doesn't seem to pull me down like usual. I'm wearing my spacesuit, but my helmet is missing. I want to say it's refreshing but I don't really feel any air enter my lungs and there's not even a breeze against my bare face.

 

""Sol?"" I speak out to the latte-void.

 

I keep walking forward as I wait for a response. No reply comes.

 

""Okay then,"" I say. ""Sol, I can't hear you, but I think I'm having a hallucination. Can you wake me up?"" I look around the beige-universe. Where's this off-white light coming from, anyway?

 

There's no features on the horizon (or any sort of horizon). I stop walking and look around. I check all the angles I can. I can't even see the ground I'm even standing on. There's just beige. If I didn't know any better, I'd say I'm still floating here.

 

It's so damn beige.

 

""Well, this is new,"" I say as I try to blink some dirt out of my eyes. No idea how I got dirt in them; this is one of the reasons why I wear a helmet.

 

I keep blinking but this one particular black dot stays. I have to release my suit’s gloves to rub the dirt out. Wait - that's not dirt. There's something here, or there really. Something darker than the beige.

 

I groan as I walk towards it. ""This isn't going to end good for me. Unless I've already died,"" I say aloud to no one. That's a great thought.

 

Ugh it's so beige, though. I can't tell if my feet are walking straight or not. It's so confusing here.

 

The black dot I see has grown a bit in size. I have no idea how much time I spent walking to it, though. It seems so far away. I stop walking for a second and scan the invisible horizon. I see some other distant dots in the distance.

 

""Oh,"" I say, ""I'm definitely dead, aren't I?"" I wish Sol would just answer me. ""Wake me up, Sol! Hello!""

 

My voice scatters in the trillion directions that exist here in this beigeverse.

 

""Hello?"" I whisper out. I'm not confident that my voice is even carrying here.

 

I feel the ground shake. The beigeverse itself is shaking. I don't feel any atmospheric pressure against my face, but the air itself is shaking. I don't even think there's an atmosphere here, but it's still shaking. It feels like static electricity buzzing all around me and there's a noise growing from it.

 

It sounds like an aircraft taking off as it seems to grow in intensity from every direction. It pierces my brain and burns my synapses.

 

I cover my ears with my suit's gloves. I wish I had my helmet back.

 

With no warning, a new sight appears in the beigeverse. The proportions are epic and on a scale that I can't measure or compare to anything.

 

I'm staring at a gargantuan circle of varying colors. Its center is a red ball, circled by orange, then yellow. The yellow border fades and seamlessly blends into the beige atmosphere. I can’t tell if it’s moving or not since it blends so well.

 

The monstrous orb is in front of me and screams like static. I'm suddenly aware of my heartbeat as it tries to match the rumbling sounds.

 

As my eyes adjust to its size and shape, I see parts of its yellow borders slither and expand into the beige-nothingness.

 

""Oh no,"" I say as I turn around and run. ""No, no, no, no, no.""

 

I sprint away but I feel the rumbling follow me. I have no sense of direction except for a black dot I pick and instinctively run towards. It's so hard to tell where I'm running. I hope I'm running straight.

 

I run for minutes, years, hours, decades, months, or whatever else passes for time around here. Paradoxically, it takes no time and forever before I’m close enough to make sense of the black dot.

 

The black dot is a much smaller orb, around the size of an elephant. It's a swirling black mass covered in some sort of slick oil that constantly flows around itself.

 

I notice the rumbling sound has decreased after I approached this new feature. I think it's close enough for me to reach out and touch it, but there's no depth perception here. I might still be far away. I don’t dare to reach out.

 

I turn around and face the monster-ball. I think the monster is farther away than before, at least. It looks smaller, but it’s impossible to tell. It’s just so massive. Its red center pulsates and sends a shockwave through the orange and yellow borders. The colors blend and shake throughout its entire shape.

 

""Ha!"" I yell at it. ""I got you!""

 

The red circle in the center of the orb disappears. The orange shell fills in the missing red, before the orange disappears too. Then, the monster appears as a fully yellow ball before eventually dissipating into the cream-colored atmosphere.

 

“I guess that worked."" I laugh.

 

Something grabs my leg. I look back and see an oily, black tentacle wrap itself around my leg. It’s coming directly from the blackened mass.

 

""Oh,"" I say as another black, oily tentacle escapes from the orb and wraps itself around my waist.

 

The oily appendages pull me backwards and more tentacles reach out to grab me. In short time, they cover my face and I can no longer see or speak. I see nothing but blackness again as I’m pulled backwards into the elephant-sized black mass.

 

I can feel my body and mind dissipate while I hear the static droning again in the deep recesses of my mind. It feels like it’s changing the settings of my brain.

 

I remember the End of All now. I remember everything, but I know I'll forget it once I wake up the next time.

Before Wegovy, even the first few months on it, hydration was *never* something I struggled with. But when I was on 1mg back in February, I had a rough experience:
One day I started getting postural hypertension (my vision would black out when standing), which I had never experienced before. I got a blood test, and the next day — while I was at my hospital placement — I had *seven* missed calls from my doctor telling me to call back ASAP, which is pretty bloody scary to hear as a voicemail.

When I did, she told me my kidneys were seriously dehydrated and I needed to go to the ER for IV fluids to prevent permanent damage.
It was frightening how quickly things got dangerous. Not that it’s an excuse, but the prior few days had been the hottest my part of the country had seen in over five years, and I didn’t realise how little I was drinking. I was so focused on my placement that I would have a coffee and sips of water throughout the day without thinking much of it.

Since then, I’ve made an effort to stay on top of hydration — drinking water, Powerades, and Hydralyte — but lately, I’ve noticed myself slipping again. It’s not as severe as before, but sometimes when I stand up, my vision dims a bit. Even when that prompts me to pour a glass of water, sometimes I just… forget to drink all of it (oops). Just to clarify, it’s not POTS; all three doctors I’ve consulted — in the ER and at my regular GP clinic — agree it’s dehydration.

I never want to get back to where I was. I want to take better care of my kidneys and my overall health.

Does anyone have tips or tricks for staying consistently hydrated during the day?
I’d love to hear what works for you — whether it’s a hydration routine or something that helps you remember to drink more throughout the day and ensures you actually follow through with it!

Thanks so much!",10,1745838454.0,WegovyWeightLoss,6,1.0,False
1k9suuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1k9suuz/has_anyone_else_concluded_that_its_unreasonable/,Has anyone else concluded that it's unreasonable to attempt to induce autophagy daily?,"I first got into IF with the goal of inducing autophagy, for the purported long-term health benefits, everyday. But I've realized as I attempt this just how difficult it is given what we understand about how to (likely) induce autophagy. Going forward, it seems like one (or maybe two) long fasts weekly is the only reasonable way to fast with the goal of regularly achieving autophagy. I'm wondering if anyone else has come to this conclusion.

The biggest hurdle is simply the time which you must be fasting to induce autophagy. If it were 14-15 hours, that'd be one thing, but the number which I've seen thrown around online is 18 hours on the \*low end\*. Meaning that you must be fasting for 18 hours at least to induce autophagy and, to be safe, you'll probably want to aim for 20. With 24 hours in a day, it's obviously a very limited timeframe, but still could fit nicely into a OMAD diet.

Then there's the fact that autophagy seems to be extremely finicky. Not only do you want to fast for 20 hours but, unlike fasting for weight loss/ketosis, this is a true fast where not a single calorie may grace your lips. This includes black coffee. This includes sugar-free gum. Some sources online say that any caffeine, even in calorie-free pill form, may impede the induction of autophagy. Even certain supplements are discouraged. So what I've concluded is that the only things I'm allowed to safely consume when fasting for autophagy are water and (calorie-free) electrolytes, both of which are encouraged luckily.

Now, this is all tough enough on its own but then you think more about autophagy as a process. It's only \*induced\* after (maybe) 18 hours. And it probably doesn't start off at full-strength, so to speak. Doing OMAD probably means that you're in a fasted state for about 20-22 hours daily, so you'll be able to enjoy \*maybe\* 4 hours of autophagy, and that's just in the wee hours when the process is just getting started. Conversely, a single 36-hour fast likely grants you a nice uninterrupted 16-18 autophagic period. I'm an idiot who knows nothing, but this certainly sounds much more beneficial.

Now that's all certainly possible. But, speaking from experience, it gets extremely difficult to simply remain a productive member of society when sticking to all these rules. IF more broadly has actually made me feel much better in my daily life, but doing it strictly enough to induce autophagy daily radically has the opposite effect. Has anyone else had a similar journey? Would love to hear some thoughts.",4,1745838425.0,intermittentfasting,6,1.0,False

Complete review here!,"The VeRosky KY0818 Portable Air Conditioner has become a surprising addition to my workspace. Honestly, I didn’t expect much from a compact cooling fan, but testing this product daily has offered several insights worth sharing. I’ve used it during daytime work hours, relaxing evenings, and even on a short camping trip. What stands out about this personal air conditioner is its simplicity and functionality, but as with anything, there are trade-offs.

**Compact, Versatile Design**  
This device is small enough to sit neatly on my desk, bedside table, or even my coffee table. Measuring only 5.7""D x 7.48""W x 5.68""H and weighing a light 2.4 pounds, I’ve easily moved it between rooms without any hassle. The sleek white exterior looks modern, and it doesn’t clash with my décor, which is a nice touch. Plus, the freestanding design makes it incredibly easy to place anywhere without requiring special installation. 

**Check VeRosky KY0818 price on Amazon.**  

**Performance and Cooling Capability**  
For a small air cooler, it surprisingly does what it promises: it keeps personal spaces cool. The three-in-one evaporative feature circulates air, and when I added ice water to the tank, it made the air cooler and more comfortable. However, I quickly realized that it’s better as a personal cooling station rather than expecting it to lower the temperature of an entire room. It’s ideal if you situate it close by—a lesson I learned the hard way when I placed it too far during a humid day.  

**Touch Controls and User Interface**  
The LED touch screen is another feature that impressed me more than anticipated. Unlike traditional air coolers with knobs and endless clicking sounds, this product offers a touch interface that feels sleek and modern. Adjusting the fan speed or setting the timer felt intuitive and quick. With three cooling speeds, low, medium, and high, along with a 90° adjustable air vent, I could customize the airflow just how I liked it. 

**Adjustable Timer and Noise Level**  
The timer feature has been unexpectedly useful. Coming in at 1H, 3H, or 6H settings, the timer is perfect for short naps or focused working sessions. I don’t have to worry about turning it off manually before heading to bed. Speaking of sleep, the noise level is incredibly low, even quieter than my past experiences with portable air coolers—it barely reaches 38 dB. Granted, I did notice the faint sound of water circulation when using ice water, but it wasn’t disruptive.

**Energy Saving and USB Convenience**  
Sustainability always grabs my attention, and this unit is ozone-refrigerant-free, which earns it eco-friendly points. It also runs on USB power, which I found extremely convenient. Whether connected to a power bank, wall adapter, or even my laptop, operating it was seamless. Keep in mind, though, that you'll need a USB adapter of at least 5V 2A since it doesn’t come with one, which might take some users by surprise.  

**Advantages**  
Here are some of the key benefits I noted:  
- Compact and lightweight for home or outdoor use  
- Fits seamlessly with modern décor  
- Intuitive touch controls for easy use  
- Low noise level ideal for sleeping or focused work  
- Energy-efficient and eco-friendly design  

**Disadvantages**  
However, there are areas for improvement:  
- Small cooling area; less effective in large spaces  
- No included USB wall adapter  
- Requires regular water and ice refills for optimal cooling  

**Competitors**  
Pitting the VeRosky KY0818 against other portable air conditioners like the Black+Decker BPACT10WT, it becomes clear that this is designed for a smaller-scale audience. While the Black+Decker boasts the ability to cool larger rooms, its higher price and bulkier size make it more suitable for different needs. Another contender is the Honeywell CO30XE, which offers a more robust evaporative system but compromises with increased noise. Between these, the KY0818 stands out for its portability and energy efficiency, making it a practical choice if you’re looking for personal cooling without overcomplicating things.

**Cost Efficiency**  
In terms of price-to-quality ratio, this air conditioner feels like a smart investment for those who need efficient cooling at a personal level. While more robust units excel in performance for larger spaces, the balance between cost, energy consumption, and practicality makes this device feel worth the money. If staying comfortable while saving on energy bills appeals to you, then this unit isn't likely to disappoint.

\*She knew it was a dream, but it felt so real, like it was happening all over again.\* 



The drip, drip, drip of the water as it hit the cement floor was loud in the otherwise tomb-like silence of the basement. One of the pipes running along the ceiling had a leak, and a pool of water was gathered underneath it. There was barely any light down in the basement, there was only one tiny window in the upper corner of the large dark room. 



Because it was so small, it wasn’t especially useful in terms of letting light into the basement, even if it hadn’t been dark outside. There was only a small stream of moonlight coming in from it now, the stream of light bounced off the water gathered under the leaking pipe. 



It made a bright enough glow, that you could see the small form of an incredibly young female chained to the nearby support post. Her body lay crumpled on the cold stone floor, blood covered her, and was splattered all around her. A small pool of it surrounded her.



The little female’s eyes were open, but they were lifeless. If you looked closely, you could see she was still breathing. She was covered in open gashes made from the whip her mother had used on her, bruises from the beating her father had given her, and slashes from the knife her sister had sliced her up with.



The little female didn’t know why her punishment was so harsh this time around, she didn’t remember misbehaving or breaking any rules. Her family hated her, they beat her endlessly, for every little infraction. She never understood what she had done to bring on so much hate. None of the other pups were treated like her.



She did look different from everyone in both her mother and father’s Clan, with her dark skin, black hair and her dual colored eyes, the inner ring was a violet color, the outer ring silver. Her Clan members were all pale skinned with blond hair and blue dual colored eyes. She may look different from her Clan members, but there were other Clans with pups who had dark hair and skin, but they were all loved by their family and Clan members.



However, no one had her eye color. That fact and not having a wolf like the other Werewolves, made the little female, Alora, feel like a freak of nature, an abomination to be erased from existence. Alora wanted to die, she longed for it. She thought it was the only way to escape from all her pain and torment.



Alora was desolate, full of despair and hopelessness. Tears leaked out the corners of her eyes. “Moon Goddess, please let me die and let my soul return to your keeping.” The girl begged silently with all her heart.



She was startled when she got a reply in her head, but it wasn’t the Moon Goddess who answered her. It was something else entirely. \*“I'd rather not die just yet, especially when I have now finally been able to join you.”\* There was a faint growl in the soft feminine voice. 



Panicked, Alora exclaimed, \*“Who are you!”\*she was worried she had lost her mind. 



\*“I’m your wolf, my name is Xena”\* The female voice said, introducing herself to the little female.



\*“But…but…I was born without a wolf.”\* Alora said, her small child-like voice trembled with disbelief. 



For Alora, it was easier to believe she had gone insane and was hearing voices, than it was for her to accept that she was lied to all her young life, and really did have a wolf. 



\*“You were born with a wolf, I just haven’t been able to come to you until now. I have been sealed away until tonight.”\* Xena told Alora. Xena's voice, like Alora’s, was young, the growl in it sounding cute instead of intimidating.



\*“You know my name?”\* Alora asked Xena, feeling surprised.



Xena thought this was a silly question at first, but then she had been sealed away from Alora since their birth. \*“I may have been sealed away, but I was aware of our life the entire time, I’m a part of you and know your name.”\* Xena explained to her. 



Xena’s soft growling voice and her warm presence was beginning to sooth Alora, her intense longing for death fading to the background for now. \*“You said you were sealed away? How did you get free?”\* Alora asked. 



Her curiosity now peaked as she started to accept that she did indeed have a wolf, she was no longer a wolf-less pup. Excitement over that fact began to build in her.



Xena felt her humanoid form’s curiosity, her and Alora were two sides of one being. Two souls, one shared body that transformed from a humanoid form to that of a wolf or their shared Lycan form. Their Lycan form would be their most powerful and deadliest of their three shapes. 



\*“The Moon Goddess broke the chains binding me from you.”\* Xena paused in her explanation, not really wanting to tell Alora the rest.



Alora felt Xena’s distress, she knew instinctively what Xena had to tell her had to be something that would upset her. \*“Tell me.”\* Was all she said.



That was all the prompting Xena needed, her humanoid needed to know, so she could begin to separate herself from the cause. \*“Our mother had the spell placed on us that sealed me away.”\* 



Alora was quite a moment as she absorbed that information, a wave of hurt running through her. She had known all along her mother had hated her, she just hadn’t known how deeply till this moment. 



\*“Why does mother hate us so much?”\* Alora asked, tears in her voice.



Xena was silent for a moment, hesitant to answer. \*“Because we are everything she fears.”\*



BEEEEP, BEEEEP, BEEEEP!!! 



Alora sat up straight in bed, startled out of the dream. Xena’s cryptic answer to her question all those years ago fading away. She slapped at her alarm clock, her heart still racing. It was the worst way to wake up, not only did her body shake. The alarm sounded so much like the fryers at work, it made her feel like she needed to rush into a kitchen to dish out fresh fries. 



Nothing was more annoying than dreaming that you were at work when you are not at work. There you are, standing there in your dream, pushing the button to turn off the fryer alarm, only for it to keep going. Then you start to realize, you are not at work, you are at home in bed, and it’s not the fryer’s timer going off, it's your alarm clock. 



Alora didn’t usually need the alarm clock, she rarely slept more than two hours at a time at most when she managed to fall asleep at home. If you could call this place a home. According to the romance novels she occasionally read, the rare time she read a fiction novel, a home was a place you felt loved, and safe in. That was not this place.



Hopping out of her rarely used bed. A tiny twin size that belonged to her older sister when her sister was a small cub. Alora brushed her hair, this took a while, as the thick midnight black strands reached just above her hips. Alora took her showers at school, or the research lab she interned at, never at the house. She had interned at the lab last night after she had gotten off work from her fast food job at Wolf’s Bite Burger Palace. 



Normally she would have slept at the lab for four hours before sneaking back in through the second floor patio door. Unfortunately, Alora had done that one too many nights in a row, and it was noticed. Based on the text message Alora got from her mother Bettina, accusing Alora of being a harlot and staying out at all hours of the night being a prostitute. 



So, Alora had to report home by eleven the night before, and spent most of the night studying, before she finally gave in to exhaustion. Alora had tucked her chair under her tiny bedroom’s doorknob, set her refurbished alarm clock, and passed out for two hours. 



Alora looked at herself in her dingy cheap, supposedly full length, mirror hanging on her closet door. Her room was adjacent to the attic, an eight by eight with only a seven foot ceiling. A tight fit for a six foot nine Werewolf. There was no window, the only light was a tiny lamp on the tiny desk in her room. The only other piece of furniture besides her bed and desk chair.



Alora was fit, like most Werewolves. She had lots of evenly toned muscle. She had an hourglass figure with broad shoulders, heavy breasts with wide hips and a bottom that balanced out with her top. Her large luminescent eyes matched her face better now that she was grown, they no longer took up most of her face anymore.



High cheekbones paired with an angled jaw and a gently pointed chin framed a long straight almost lupine nose, and a generous mouth with full plump lips. Her lips a natural dusky rose was accentuated by her milky caramel colored skin complexion.



Alora was not delicate looking like her mother and sister, who only came in at five foot nine and five foot ten. Alora’s body matched her height. Her father had to look up to her as he was only six foot seven, he was also one of the rare few Werewolves who could be called overweight.







# Chapter 2: ""...you look beautiful.""



 Alora put her hair back in a french braid, but when she reached for her usual extra baggy track pants and overly large hoodie, she paused. Alora always wore this kind of attire to hide, and not for the first time, Alora wondered why she continued to do so.



She hid her body to avoid the ridicule her mother and sister gave her, and the lecherous looks from her father. However, that has never worked for her. Her mother and sister still call her a whore, and a slut. The baggie clothes just make them think she was also fat, and her father still shot lecherous glares at her voluminous chest and ass.



Alora had started buying clothes with what little money she was allowed to keep out of her paychecks from the Wolf’s Bite Burger Palace. They were clothes she was planning to start wearing when she was finally able to move out of the house Alora thought of as a hell hole. 



She was also saving up for a car and was glad her best friend Darien pushed her to get her driver's license, even without owning a car. There was a professor at the Packs University of Medical, Science, Technology and The Arts, or MSTA for short, that let Alora borrow her car when she needed to go to a faraway science event that required personal transportation to get to. 



Alora opened her tiny closet and brought out a small dark purple athletic duffle bag Alora had purchased months ago. Every new item of clothing she had slowly collected was folded up neatly and placed inside this duffle bag. There was also a large galaxy print camping pack, in the closet, it was big enough to carry everything else that was important to her.



Her laptop, an Acer Nitro 5, would definitely be going with her. Her journals of medical formulas and all her notes on her current experiments at the Pack’s Medical Lab were already packed. She would pack up her laptop before leaving the house. All of Alora’s toiletries were always stored in the bag because she never took showers at home, along with a spare pair of shoes.



Alora pulled out a set of clothes from the bag. A pair of short black denim shorts, with thick silver colored functional zippers from the hem to the waistband went up both sides of the shorts. A quick release snap kept the zippers from sliding down. They also had a normal front fly with zipper and silver colored button. Inside was a soft cotton liner on the crotch of the shorts to protect a female's lady bits. 



The top Alora pulled out was a purple midriff tank top, with a thick enough shelf bra to prevent nipples from showing. There was a thin bead of silicone that lined the chest band of the top shelf bra, to keep it from shifting when moving. There was another small bead of silicon along the bottom hem of the top, to keep the fabric from sliding up.



A thick functional silver colored zipper went from the hem to the neckline down the front of the top. Like the shorts there was a quick release snap to keep the zipper from sliding down on its own. The straps of the top were only an inch wide, and the neck of the top dipped enough to show two inches of cleavage. Alora had a lot of breast, so two inches of cleavage would not make her a slut or a whore. At least that’s what her best friend had said. 



Alora put on the outfit, then a strappy pair of black slingback toe ring sandals, the back had an elastic band, allowing the sandles to be taken off or put on quickly. Everything was designed and made for beings that shifted, like Werewolves. Her track pants had a quick release buckle at the waistband, and her hoodies all had zippers. 



After putting in all her silver colored hoops, Alora had six piercings in each ear, four in each lob, and two just before the curve of each ear. The two hoops in the upper piercings of her ears were small. The bottom four hoops were bigger. The bottom of the largest two silver colored hoops, touched the middle of her long neck. The other three pairs, the farther up, got smaller by an inch.



Once dressed, Alora looked at herself in the mirror. \*“You don’t look like a whore or a slut, you look beautiful.”\* Xena told her, looking out Alora’s eyes from within.



Alora looked at herself in the mirror more. \*“You don’t think I would stand out too much?”\* Alora asked Xena.



Xena was able to feel Alora’s emotions and knew her humanoid needed encouragement. \*“You’re dressed in the same clothing most werewolf females wear on a daily basis.”\* Xena said, hoping the reminder would help. 



Still feeling underdressed and too exposed, Alora grabbed her hoodie, she unzipped it and slung it around her shoulders. It was a large black hoodie. On the back was a skull decorated with blue and violet roses. She was about to zip it up but stopped. 



The hem hung an inch below the hem of the shorts, the hoodie sat loosely on her shoulders. Looking in the mirror again, Alora dropped her hands to the side, she decided not to zip the hoodie. This would do, Xena nodded her head inside Alora, approving of Alora’s decision. 



She packed her laptop, a gift from Damien, Darien's older brother, forced on her through Darien, into her camping bag. Unplugging her phone charger from the wall she packed that up as well, then grabbed her phone, and looked at the date.



This was the last week of school. They had three days of exams, the final fight training and ranking exam, and the written exams, for the only three courses she had at the High School. At the University, she had already finished all her final exams and would be receiving her doctorates in Genetics, Hematology, Biochemistry and Microbiology.



Alora had been studying all these subjects ever since she was nine and received her wolf. That was when Alora found out her genetics were the very reason her family hated her. Alora kept asking herself why she was born the way she was. A trip to the Packs library and many books about genetics later, and Alora was hooked on science. 



When she was in middle school it was proven that she was a genius, even among their highly intelligent species. She rarely slept, four hours at most a night, when she was not sleeping, she had been studying. She would rarely spend time with others, and when she did, she only spent time together with Darien and his older brother Damien. 



Damien, who was five years older than both Alora and Darien, was off at the top University for Alpha training. Damien was in his final year and would be home sometime in the next two weeks. Damien, Darien and their parents, Alpha Andrew, and Luna Ember were the only reason Alora was able to make it as far as she had with her education. 



If it were up to her parents, she would have been pulled from school at fourteen and never allowed to even finish high school, let alone start college while in middle school. Of course, that had a lot to do with her sister Sarah. The beloved princess of their family. 



Sarah had been held back twice, once in elementary school, and again in middle school. Sarah was now graduating this year as a twenty year old senior, barely. The most popular girl in school had some of the worst grades. Or she did till she learned to pay others to do her work for her. 



Alora was lucky she did not have any classes with Sarah, or she would be the one forced to do her homework. Only if Alora did it, Sarah wouldn’t have to pay anyone. Alora had managed to avoid being chained up in the basement and subjected to Sarah’s tender mercies for a while now, and she would rather keep it that way.



With a gusty sigh, Alora threw herself backwards onto her bed, cell phone in hand, looking at the time. Werewolves did not usually wear watches, unless they were attached to a specially spelled band. One that would change to match the size of the wearer. Those were expensive, and Alora didn’t have the money to spare for something like that yet. 



After she received all her graduation certificates and went to work for the Pack Labs as the Lead Researcher with a team of her own, she would. The Labs had already guaranteed that she would continue to have a job with them. Now that her internship had ended, they could make her an actual employee with full benefits and the pay to match her position.



Alora was looking forward to that day, her certificates would be given to her today. When the sun set, she would officially be a PhD. A PhD who was still in high school. As a science student, one who was studying genetics, Alora had once wondered if her parents were truly her parents. So, she had a DNA test done and ran through the Pack’s DNA database. 



Sadly, it only proved she was their daughter, it also revealed a dirty secret her mother would rather not have mentioned. Technically it was not a secret, it was just such a little talked about fact, it was as if everyone forgot about it. Bettina was originally from the Heartsong Clan.







# Chapter 3: ""Parked and waiting...""



 Bettina’s father had been the last Alpha of the Heartsong Clan. When Bettina’s mother and sister died in a mudslide, Bettina’s aunt took custody of Bettina. It was said that at the time, Brodie Shadowtail Heartsong was too distraught over losing his mate to take care of his last living daughter.



Bettina was adopted by her aunt, her mother’s sister, and renamed. She went from being Bettina Frost Heartsong, to Bettina North Frost. Then when she was married to Alister, her name was changed again to Bettina Frost Northmountain. Effectively burying her relationship with Alpha Brodie Heartsong. 



Alora knew why, to the Frost and Northmountains, nothing was worse than a Heartsong. Alora thought it was stupid, because of the importance part of the Heartsong Clan played in Werewolf History, and the History of all Supernaturals. The first Alpha of Alpha’s was the Clan Alpha of the Heartsongs. A Female by the name Luna Bloodmoon Heartsong. 



There was a painted portrait of her hung up in Alpha Andrews office. Alora used to stare at it and would always think she looked a lot like her. Getting the DNA results back and seeing that she was a direct descendant of the First Alpha had been a great day, at first. 



Because that was not a relation Bettina, or Sarah would quietly allow Alora to claim. They were too proud of being ‘genetically pure’ to allow that. It would lower their status within the Frost and Northmountain Clans. So, she could only claim it privately. 



Alora had been given an idea though, one she carried through with on her birthday three days ago. Darien had taken her from school that day to the Moonstar Mansion. Where his parents had a cake and presents for her. The new phone she was holding was one of them, a Galaxy 22 Ultra.



The other was the hoodie she was wearing, and an apartment in the Moonstar Mansion that would be ready for her in a few days was another. The Alpha and Luna had been sure for years that she was being abused but had never been able to prove it.



How can you prove years of abuse when your skin didn’t scar, and you refused to talk about it as a young pup, because of the threats your family had made against you if you did. Now that she was older, it had become easier to avoid the abuse. 



Literally by nearly never being home. During the week she went to two schools, then to work, then her internship at the lab, on the weekends it was work, library for study, then internship at the labs. The few times she was home, it was only for a couple of hours at a time. 



Alora was fortunate enough that when they did beat her, and lock her in the basement, it wasn’t for days at a time anymore. To keep her locked up for more than a night would invite trouble. There would be questions asked that her parents didn’t want to be answered truthfully. 



She was eighteen now, so today, when she went to school, she could potentially find her mate today. Thinking of a mate made Alora think of Damien. She knew she shouldn’t, it was impossible to think Damien would be her mate. Why would the Moon goddess bless her to be with the next Alpha of Alpha’s. 



\*“He would make a wonderful mate, he’s always been really kind to us.”\* Xena said. 



Xena was right. \*“I still remember opening my eyes the day we met him and thinking, he had the most handsome eyes.”\* Alora said.



The inner ring of Damien’s eyes was a deep ocean blue, the outer ring a dark midnight. Golden skin and black hair that would shine with dark blue highlights in the sun.



The day they met, Sarah and her friends had tossed Alora into the River while they were attending a Pack Picnic. The only reason Alora went was because the neighbor who would babysit her on occasion, had suggested bringing her with her family while dropping her off at home. 



Bettina had tried to use the excuse that they didn’t have anything for Alora to wear. The older female told Bettina that she had a dress that was too small for her daughter, so it wouldn’t be a problem for Alora to have it. It had been a pretty white campesino dress, with bright blue ‘forget-me-nots’ embroidered above and below the lattice work of the ruffled blouse and skirt. 



The female had brought the dress the morning of the picnic, she even braided Alora’s hair into twin french braids that trailed over her shoulders. Weaved through the braids, were blue ribbons that matched the blue thread on the dress. Alora had looked beautiful according to those who saw her at the Picnic. Those who were not Frost and Northmountains. 



The comments had not gone unnoticed by Sarah, who became extremely jealous when she was ignored by others in favor of Alora. When they were with their Clan, Sarah was praised as being the ultimate beauty, while Alora was regarded as a dark stain upon their family. Among the rest of the Pack, Alora was just another beautiful little pup to be cherished. 



The jealousy Sarah had felt had caused her to run to her parents in tears, accusing Alora of being mean to her. With that, Alora was pulled to a secluded part of the park away from the others. With a painful slap to the cheek delivered by Bettina, she was ordered home for embarrassing her sister at the Pack Picnic.



Alora hadn’t gotten far when her sister and her friends had grabbed her, beaten her up and then dragged her to the edge of the swollen riverbank before tossing her in. She had been tossed around inside the rushing current. Her body smashed into rocks and sticks repeatedly till she was washed close enough to a bank further down the river, that she was able to latch onto something and pull herself out. 



She had passed out in the mud of the bank as soon as she was on shore, only to wake for the briefest of moments when she was found by Damien and his father Alpha Andrew. They had taken her to Luna Ember, who had insisted on personally taking care of Alora till she recovered. She spent a whole week inside the Moonstar Mansion. 



\*“He never left our side during the whole week we were there.”\* Xena reminded Alora.



\*“Yes well…I don’t want to get my hopes up only to have them crushed when reality comes knocking with someone else.”\* Alora said to Xena, her tone drier than the desert. 



BANG! BANG! BANG! “YOU BETTER BE AWAKE IN THERE YOU WRETCH! I’LL NOT HAVE YOU EMBARRASSING ME TODAY! YOU BETTER GET TO SCHOOL ON TIME!” Bettina shrieked at Alora through the door, after banging on it so viciously.



Alora had sat up, startled by the sound, then she sighed and rolled her eyes. “I’m up.” Alora raised her voice enough to be heard through the door. 



There was a “Humph!” from the other side, then the sound of Bettina stomping back down the stairs. 



Alora’s phone notification ringtone sounded. She had a message from her friend Darien. \*“Parked and waiting, have a bag with the breakfast of champions. Five Big Sur Breakfast Burritos, a large to-go carton of oat milk, and your snooty coffee.”\* 



By the Gods and Goddesses above you had to love a best friend who came to pick you up with food and coffee in hand. Werewolves burned a lot of fuel, so they ate a lot. Unfortunately for Alora, her family would give her looks that made her lose her appetite every time she ate with them. So, she didn’t eat at home. 



\*“Be down in two shakes of a tail.”\* Alora sent as her reply, then she was grabbing her packed bag and leaving her room. Xena, always observing everything, laughed in amusement at Alora’s reply. 



The house had four levels, the basement, that went the entire length of the house. Then on the first floor, in the front of the house, you had the four car garage, a large foyer, a living room, and a large den. In the back was the extra large master suite, the large formal dining room. 



An industrial kitchen with an attached breakfast nook. A large pantry with a second large fridge, and deep freeze in it. A large laundry room with two washers and dryers, and a large laundry table and hopper sink. Then you came to the staircase that led to the second, and then third floor. 



The second floor had a long hallway that led the entire back length of the house. With row after row of windows looking into the back yard. There had originally been four large rooms on this floor, but Sarah complained she didn’t have enough space. So, the entire second floor was converted into one bedroom for her.



The house had a dual level covered wrap around porch. There was a door on the second floor across from the stairwell that led onto the second level of the back porch. That’s the door Alora went out, completely bypassing the first floor where her family was gathered, eating breakfast. 



A quick run around the porch brought Alora to the stairwell that led down to the porch’s first level, located next to the garage. Alora didn’t bother with the stairs when she reached the front of the house though, she vaulted over the railing, landing easily on the ground, her knees bending a little. Then she was running down the street.







# Chapter 4: ""Her eyes talk...""



 Darien had the top down to his dark blue Shelby Mustang convertible and the motor running. The car was pointed in a direction away from the house. Alora threw her bag into the back seat and hopped over the closed passenger door into the front seat seconds before she heard Bettina screaming from the Driveway. 



“YOU WRETCHED MONGREL GET BACK HERE! YOUR NOT SUPPOSED TO LEAVE BEFORE YOUR SISTER!” Her shrieked order was ignored. 



Darien, laughing, put his foot down and off they went, hitting sixty in just seconds. Darien tossed a brown sack full of hot food to Alora, her oat milk was already in a cup holder with the straw in it. Alora didn’t waste any time tearing into the first foil wrapped breakfast burrito. 



Darien laughed again, amused by her antics. Then he noticed how she was dressed, it shocked him at first to see Alora expose so much of her skin, especially when he was so used to her trying to hide as much of it as possible. Her hair was even pulled back into a braid, she was not hiding her face behind it like normal. 



Darien frowned, he knew what it meant. His friend was done hiding herself away like some kind of shameful secret. He knew this was something Damien would want to know about. He wanted to confirm what he was thinking so he asked, “Nice get up, you done hiding yourself?” making sure to keep his tone jovial.



Alora knew her friend better than he thought she did. “I know it’s upset you to see me ‘hide’” she mimed quotation marks, “myself away like some ‘shameful’” more miming of quotation marks, “secret all these years. So, you’ll be happy to note, my overly observant and curious best friend, that yes, yes I am done hiding.” 



Darien laughed, and Alora wolfed down the rest of her breakfast. She looked at her friend and noticed he looked a little nervous. It took her a moment to realize why. Her friend had turned eighteen three months ago and hadn’t found a mate yet. 



“A lot of Wolves turned eighteen over this weekend.” Alora said in an off handed manner. 



Alora’s statement made Darien swerve for a second, making Alora laugh, as it confirmed her theory. “Yeah…what of it?"" Darien asked, he tried to make it sound like he didn’t care and failed miserably. 



“Come on, who is it? You must have had your eye on one of the females who turned.” Alora said teasingly. 



Darien blushed, he knew better than to react to Alora’s outrageous antics, it only gave himself away. “I don’t want to say.” Trying one last time to maintain some dignity. 



It didn’t work, because she was his best friend, and no one knew him better. Except his brother Damien, but then Damien was wrapped around Alora’s finger. The best part about that was, Alora didn’t even know it. 



“I bet I know who it is.” Alora couldn’t keep her excitement out of her tone, and practically sung her words. 



Alora had a beautiful singing voice, one that enchanted and hypnotized everyone within hearing, everyone but her family, when she bothered to sing. In fact, it was because of her family that Alora rarely sang, so when she did, it was truly a special occasion.



Damien was the only one she would sing for whenever he asked her to. They had a special bond, one he hoped meant they were fated to be each other's mate. 



“Really now, and just who do you think it is?” Darien asked in a drawl. 



“Serenity Mountainmover.” Alora said, her tone bright, almost gloating. 



Darien coughed, his face twisted in a wry expression, he should have known. “That obvious, am I?” he asked her. 



“You’ve been staring longingly at her for weeks.” Alora said, her look gentled, and a genuinely happy smile was on her face. 



Alora truly hoped it was Serenity because she liked the female. Serenity was one of those beings who was genuinely good, all the way to their soul, but she was also mischievous, like her best friend here. They would make the cutest of mated couples in Alora’s opinion. 



Axel, laughed at Darien, his humanoid had indeed been too obvious with his staring \*“You have practically drooled while staring at that tasty looking redhead.”\* He said to Darien.



Darien growled at his wolf. \*“Like you don’t roll around every time her scent blows our way.”\* 



This shut Axel up. “Yes well, it’s all that hair. There is so much of the fiery mass, I just want to stick my face in it and see if it’s as warm as it smells…I mean looks.” Darien added the last part quickly, but there was no saving himself.



Alora laughed, she couldn’t help it, and when Darien blushed, she laughed more. “Yeah, yeah, keep laughing. What are you going to do if you find a mate today?” He asked her. 



The words were out of her mouth before she even realized she said them. “Hope he doesn’t reject me on the spot.” Her eyes widened and she covered her mouth with both hands. 



Darien gave her a look from the corner of his eye. “Tell me you’re not expecting to be rejected.” He asked.



“Let’s just say it’s best to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.” Alora said after a moment, sighing after she gave her answer. 



Darien didn’t sit there and try to talk his friend into believing she had no reason to fear being rejected, knew it would be a waste of breath and would just annoy Alora. Darien honestly didn’t believe anyone, but his brother Damien deserved to be Alora’s mate. 



Darien didn’t say it though. \*“If anyone deserved to have a mate that would worship the ground, she walked upon…its Alora.”\* Darien said to his wolf.



\*“On this we are agreed, Damien and Zane absolutely would.”\* Axel said, having been thinking the same way Darien was. \*“And you are right to think she would deny ever being worthy enough to have them as her mate.”\*



\*“How come you sound like some Ancient Council lawyer whenever you get serious?”\* Darien asked his wolf. 



\*“I’m an old soul, sue me.”\* Axel snapped at Darien with a growl, making Darien laugh.



They pulled into the school parking lot, Alora had taken over his radio and was playing her extremely eclectic music list. His radio was currently blasting Notorious by Neoni. The base was turned up loud enough to shake the doors if they were not properly insulated. An upgrade he got after the first car ride with Alora. 



She liked her music loud enough to drown out her own thoughts sometimes. Using it as a type of therapy when she couldn’t take it anymore. He knew she had more than a few songs that helped talk her away from suicide. 



They say music can save people, seeing it do just that for his friend, more of a sister really, had him making a lot of sound specific changes to his vehicles, and having more than a few requirements when it came to their motorcycle gear. Like linking Bluetooth motorcycle helmets with surround sound and ambient sound capability.



He always carried some kind of headphones or earbuds with him, as well as a portable speaker, with bass boost of course, in his pack. Alora did too, she’d been gifted a lot of her tech. It wasn’t just his brother who loved and adored Alora, his parents did too. Alora may not think it possible, but to them, she wasn’t just another Pack Wolf, she was family.



I parked the car, but didn’t turn off the car completely yet, just the motor. Darien could see Alora was lost in thought, her face didn’t show any expression, but he knew not to look at Alora’s expression when it came to judging her mood. His brother said it all those years ago.



“Her eyes talk even when her face doesn’t.” Damien had looked so sad when he said that, but then, he had caught her trying to slit her wrists by the river earlier that day. 



Damien had said he knew something was wrong the moment he met her eyes that morning, when she disappeared from school, he immediately went looking for her. When things got to be too much, the spot where Damien and his father had found Alora the day they met, was her go-to place.



Damien had gone there first, and said he took the knife from her just in time. Alora never actually told them what was happening at home, they could only guess. With her haunted eyes, and the willingness to end her and even her wolf’s life, they could only assume the worst. 



Alora didn't have any scars though, he had seen her with an injury so deep, it should have left a scar, but it did not. The moment Alora healed, it was like nothing happened. Making it quite easy for her family to hide the severity of their abuse. He had never heard of that happening to any species except Vampires. With Vampires, every scar they did have was worn on their Sprites skin, not their humanoid skin. 



“Are you absolutely positive Allister is your father?” Darien asked Alora.



The song had ended, and he had turned the car off. Darien’s abrupt questioning of her parentage had Alora snapping out of her thoughts and looking at Darien with a wry grin on her face. 



“Unfortunately.” Alora answered. 



“What about Bettina, surely she’s not your real mother?” Darien asked in a hopeful tone.



Looking at her, goofball of a friend, Alora’s smile got bigger. “I wish, but your mother is the one who delivered me, so even she can verify that truth.” Alora said with amusement, laughing at the overly exaggerated expression of lost hope on Darien’s face.",1,1745838241.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

I need help with resolving an issue I have with driving a 24V fan and two MAX31865 from Arduino Nano Every. I'm not a savvy Arduino user so any help would be very much appreciated.

**General Info**  
I'm building a coffee roaster. But the problem I experience is scoped to some relationship between the fan and temperature measurements. Here's the simplified schematics for this part of the project

https://preview.redd.it/nk9o11p9njxe1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb7cf16b56921c9d75a1cf3db71763543dce1fba

I've tried to refactor and significantly simplify the sketch to test things in isolation with only the absolute minimum of code. Here's my current sketch:

    #include <Adafruit_MAX31865.h>
    
    /* --- Pin Configuration --- */
    constexpr int PIN_CS_BEAN    = 9;
    constexpr int PIN_CS_EXHAUST = 8;
    constexpr int SPI_SCLK_PIN   = 10;
    constexpr int SPI_MOSI_PIN   = 11;
    constexpr int SPI_MISO_PIN   = 12;
    constexpr int PIN_FAN_PWM    = 5;
    
    /* --- Temperature Data --- */
    double currentBT = 0.0;
    double currentET = 0.0;
    
    /* --- RTD Sensor Configuration --- */
    constexpr double R_REF     = 430.0;   // Reference resistor value
    constexpr double R_NOMINAL = 100.0;   // Nominal resistance of PT100 at 0°C
    
    /* --- Hardware Interfaces --- */
    Adafruit_MAX31865 beanTempSensor(PIN_CS_BEAN, SPI_SCLK_PIN, SPI_MOSI_PIN, SPI_MISO_PIN);
    Adafruit_MAX31865 exhaustTempSensor(PIN_CS_EXHAUST, SPI_SCLK_PIN, SPI_MOSI_PIN, SPI_MISO_PIN);
    
    /* --- System Configuration --- */
    constexpr int FAN_RAMP_DELAY_MS   = 3;
    constexpr int FAN_MAX_DUTY        = 255;
    
    /* --- System State --- */
    int currentFanDuty   = 0;
    
    /* --- Sensor Reading --- */
    void updateTemperatures() {
      currentBT = beanTempSensor.temperature(R_NOMINAL, R_REF);
      currentET = exhaustTempSensor.temperature(R_NOMINAL, R_REF);
    }
    
    /* --- Fan Logic --- */
    void updateFan() {
      currentFanDuty += 5;
      if (currentFanDuty >= FAN_MAX_DUTY) {
        currentFanDuty = FAN_MAX_DUTY;
      }
      analogWrite(PIN_FAN_PWM, currentFanDuty);
      delay(FAN_RAMP_DELAY_MS);
      Serial.print(""At the end of the updateFan:"");
      Serial.println(currentBT);
    }
    
    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(115200);
    
      beanTempSensor.begin(MAX31865_4WIRE);
      exhaustTempSensor.begin(MAX31865_4WIRE);
    }
    
    void loop() {
      updateTemperatures();
      updateFan();
      Serial.print(""At the end of the loop:"");
      Serial.println(currentBT);
    }

**The Problem:**

The temperature is read fine while the fan is ramping up to the full duty. However, once it's there, the temperature readings are ""frozen"" and don't change. Even more so, at some point the new readings stop getting output into the Serial Monitor completely. However, if I physically turn off the system (yet keep the USB connection for the Arduino) with the SW1 switch, the readings in the Serial Monitor are live again. If I add something like `delay(500);` at the end of the `loop` the situation doesn't change - once the fan gets to full speed, the temperature readings are ""frozen""

Observations:

* if I set `FAN_MAX_DUTY` lower, like 200, the temp readings continue after the fan reaches that speed.
* I tried to find a sweet spot between 200 and 250 and figured out that 225 looked like that. At 226 temp reading goes fine, but after the fan reaches that speed, the readings are ""frozen"" temporarily (the same numbers get output into the monitor), then after some period, the readings get updated and frozen again, then updated and frozen again. And at some point, again, the readings just stop getting into the Serial Monitor

So, it does look like either some buffer gets overflown when the fan reaches the top speed or the fan ""eats up"" all the power from Arduino and hence, no temp readings are happening.

1k9ss31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1k9ss31/postmeal_anxiety_or_ssri_withdrawals/,Post-Meal Anxiety or SSRI Withdrawals?,"During college, I had really bad anxiety with regards to school so I started Lexapro in May of 2021. I was on it for a year and had gone up to the max dose of 20 mg but it left me feeling numb and one day in February, 2022 I just decided to quit cold turkey. I had really bad withdrawal and ended up at the ER due to a really bad panic attack during this time (don't quit SSRIs cold turkey). 

I did end up recovering though, and was back to feeling normal by the Summer of 2022. However, in September, 2022 I had a bad experience with an edible which caused me to develop depersonalization/derealization disorder. I tried to cure this naturally, without meds, and made good progress but then hit a plateau where I wasn't getting worse but I wasn't getting better. 

In July of 2023, I decided to get back on SSRIs to try to break this plateau. I started on 25 mg Zoloft which increased to 50 mg. Unfortunately, I had some really adverse side effects, my stomach was constantly upset and my anxiety was getting worse. I wanted to quit the medication so my psychiatrist advised me to go down to 25 mg and then get off. My total time on Zoloft was about 5 months, ending in November 2023. 

Coming off the Zoloft felt quick but I decided to listen to my psychiatrist's advice. However, I definitely had withdrawal symptoms over the next few months which reminded me of when I came off Lexapro cold turkey. This time the symptoms were definitely lighter, likely due to my low dose on Zoloft. (Still, do NOT quite any SSRI cold turkey, it's not worth it). 

Anyway, around January of 2024, I began noticing that I felt really strange after eating. I would get a pressure in my head accompanied with pain, difficulty thinking and hearing my inner voice, extreme fatigue, all the muscles in my body would tense up, and overall I just felt really out of it. These episodes typically reach their climax around an hour after eating and go away after about 3 hours. It's been about a year and a half later, and I still have these issues after eating. While the episodes are slightly better now than they used to be, they still affect me daily. The strange thing is that these symptoms remind me of some of my usual anxiety symptoms, but I don't mentally feel anxious as they occur. It feels very physical and occurs only after eating, with the symptoms having the same schedule of severity. 

I've been to the doctor several times now trying to get to the bottom of this, with no avail. I have ruled out any allergy or food intolerance, no matter what I eat I always feel bad afterwards. I have also ruled out reactive hypoglycemia, my blood sugar remains within healthy ranges before and after eating. I have noticed that there is some association with the amount of food I eat and how severe these episodes are after eating. I don't have any issue from drinking water, only substances with calories cause me to feel bad. I have no issue with caffeine itself (tea / black coffee), however if I eat after drinking any caffeine my episodes are also more severe. My depersonalization/derealization (DPDR) has improved a lot and mostly only bothers me in the first hour or two after waking up, during if I eat my symptoms feel more severe. On the flipside, intense exercise before a meal makes my episodes less severe. 

I've been trying to figure out the cause of this for so long now, and I always go back to the fact that my episodes started a month after I quit Zoloft. I was also experiencing withdrawal symptoms during that time period, although the only thing that stayed with me were these post-meal episodes. I don't know if I should try to get back on an SSRI to see if I feel improvement, but I'm also worried about making things worse. Could this just be anxiety? I looked at my history, and I have had a string of bad experiences after eating. I nearly choked on a meatball until someone saved me, had bad withdrawal from pills I ingested (Lexapro and Zoloft), and had a bad experiences with edibles. Could this be internalized anxiety which my body is now responding to? 

  
Sorry for the long wind up to my question, but I wanted to provide all the details for anyone reading. Anyway, I have tried my best not to skip meals because I don't want to have any issues from malnutrition. However, I am getting so tired of feeling terrible after any meal. I have to now plan my meals so that my post-meal suffering affect my life as little as possible. I am now at my wits end, and decided to get on Reddit to see if anyone else suffers or has suffered from a similar problem to this? Does anyone have any advice on how I should proceed?",1,1745838161.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1k9srii,https://www.reddit.com/r/BicycleArea/comments/1k9srii/could_the_totem_hauler_electric_bike_be_the/,Could the Totem Hauler Electric Bike be the ultimate cargo e-bike? Review inside!,"The Totem B0BN83Q8QR electric bike has been my companion through countless rides since I first got my hands on it. Whether it’s city commuting or adventurous trail rides, this fat tire e-bike doesn’t shy away from a challenge. With a fat 20""x3"" tire design, a peak 1500W motor, and an impressive range of 75 miles, it promises more than just a smooth journey—it offers versatility and power-packed performance designed for urban and off-road lovers alike.

**Design and Build Quality**  
I’ve always been a fan of products where aesthetics meet functionality, and this bike fits that description. The aluminum frame feels solid and durable, handling tricky terrains like sand and rocky paths without so much as a squeak. I found the integrated cables to be a thoughtful design touch. Not only does it make the bike look sleek, but it also minimizes the risk of accidental snags. However, at 20 inches, the bike felt a bit compact for my taller friends during our shared rides, though it suits my height well. The black color scheme, accompanied by large tires, gives it a tough, rugged look that’s perfect for camping and trail adventures.

**Performance**  
I was honestly impressed the first time I powered it up. The 750W brushless geared hub motor easily boosted me to speeds of 20mph. On hilly terrains, the motor truly shines. There’s something satisfying about climbing steep paths effortlessly when other bikes are slowing down. The riders in my outdoor group even admitted this bike has muscle. And then there’s the battery. The 48V 15Ah lithium battery holds enough juice for longer rides. My daily commute only eats up about half the charge, which feels great for knowing I have reserves if I want to explore routes further out.

[Check Totem B0BN83Q8QR price on Amazon.](https://bicyclearea.com/p/b0bn83q8qr/)

**Safety Features**  
Safety is non-negotiable, and this bike nailed some key aspects that made me feel secure. The dual disc brakes deliver responsive stopping power no matter the riding conditions. Whether I’m cruising downhill or navigating rain-slicked roads, the brakes never flinch. I also appreciate the LED headlight and taillight. They’re bright enough for night rides, ensuring that cars, pedestrians, and other riders see me from a distance. If I had one gripe, it’d be that the lights could offer multiple modes for energy conservation, but at least the default settings work great.

**Versatile Riding Modes**  
The flexibility of four riding modes makes the bike appeal to many. On lazy days, I use the Throttle Mode for a no-sweat experience. That mode alone got me through a 9-mile late-night coffee run without pedaling once! Pedal Assist Mode is fantastic when I want to feel productive but don’t want to work too hard. Walk Mode has also been a peculiar yet useful setting for gently walking the bike in crowded areas without awkwardly dragging it. For fitness lovers (or anyone sporty in your family), the regular bicycle mode gives the muscles a workout.

**Highlights**  
- Exceptionally powerful motor for versatile performance in all terrains.  
- Long-lasting 48V battery ensures extended ride times.  
- Rock-steady dual disc brakes for excellent control.  

**Critiques**  
- Some features, like lights, could benefit from more functionality.  
- A taller frame option might better suit a wider range of riders.  

**Product Rivals**  
When pitched against brands like RadPower Bikes or Aventon’s electric models, this bike emerges as a strong contender. RadPower excels with rugged designs and heavy cargo efficiency, but they often come in at a higher price without really outperforming in terms of range. Aventon, on the other hand, offers sleek designs lightweight enough for more urban adaptability, yet their batteries sometimes falter for those heavy-handed on throttle use. Compared to competing options between speed, battery longevity, and four fully adjustable modes, this bike cover its price-tag nicely and competes with real grit.

**Price Performance**  
This e-bike falls squarely within a fair price range for its features. While there are certainly models available for a cheaper ticket, they often compromise on power or range. Is the Totem worth the cost, considering the motor strength, solid brakes, and adjustable suspension? Absolutely. Cheaper bikes lose longevity with overworked batteries, so investing here saves future headaches.

1k9sq0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1k9sq0n/tried_laughland_teeth_whitening_for_a_week_heres/,Tried Laughland Teeth Whitening for a Week - Here’s What I Learned,"# Why I Decided to Try Laughland Teeth Whitening

I’ve always been a bit self-conscious about my teeth. Years of coffee and tea had left them looking dull, and while I’ve tried various whitening methods - strips, toothpaste, even some DIY remedies - nothing seemed to give me the results I wanted without causing sensitivity.

After reading several discussions and reviews online, I came across **Laughland teeth whitening**. It claimed to offer professional-level results at home, using a dentist-formulated gel and an LED mouthpiece. Skeptical but curious, I decided to give it a shot.

# What’s Inside the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

When the kit arrived, I appreciated its simplicity:

* **Whitening Gel Pens**: Easy to apply with precision.
* **LED Mouthpiece**: Designed to activate the gel for better results.
* **Clear Instructions**: Straightforward steps to follow.

The packaging was sleek, and everything felt high-quality. The gel pens were particularly user-friendly, allowing me to target each tooth without mess.

# How I Used the Laughland Kit

The process was surprisingly simple and fit easily into my daily routine:

1. **Brush and Dry Teeth**: Ensures the gel adheres properly.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Using the pen, I coated each tooth evenly.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece**: Left it in for 10 minutes while I relaxed.
4. **Rinse and Clean**: After the session, I rinsed my mouth and cleaned the mouthpiece.

I did this once a day for a week. The gel had a mild taste, and the LED mouthpiece was comfortable to wear.

# My Results After One Week

* **Day 1**: No noticeable change, but my teeth felt cleaner.
* **Day 3**: Began to see a slight whitening effect, especially on the front teeth.
* **Day 7**: Teeth appeared noticeably whiter - I'd estimate about 5 shades brighter.

Importantly, I experienced **no sensitivity**, which was a significant improvement over other products I’ve tried.

# What Sets Laughland Apart?

Several aspects made **Laughland teeth whitening** stand out:

* **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The gel is designed to be effective yet gentle on enamel.
* **LED Activation**: The mouthpiece uses LED light to enhance the whitening process.
* **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: Ensures the gel remains potent until use.

These features contributed to a more comfortable and effective whitening experience.

# How Does It Compare to Other Whitening Methods?

* **Whitening Strips**: Often caused sensitivity and provided uneven results.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Helped with surface stains but didn’t offer significant whitening.
* **Professional Treatments**: Effective but expensive and time-consuming.

Laughland offered a balanced solution - effective whitening at home without the high cost or discomfort.

# Tips for Best Results

* **Consistency**: Use the kit daily for optimal results.
* **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks**: Limit coffee, tea, and red wine during the treatment period.
* **Maintain Oral Hygiene**: Regular brushing and flossing help sustain the whitening effect.

# Final Thoughts

After a week of using **Laughland teeth whitening**, I’m pleased with the results. My teeth are visibly whiter, and I didn’t experience any sensitivity - a common issue with other products. The process was straightforward, and the kit was easy to use.

\*The night was still young on a Friday in the Blue Moon Pack. Some werewolves were still drinking at the usual weekend party, and some were tired enough to sleep early, ready for the Saturday night party. The Omegas still worked hard, except for those forced into a bedroom by more muscular werewolves.\*



\*The posh side of the pack house should have always kept quiet to avoid disturbing the upper class. However, one bedroom was vivacious. The mating smell filled the warm room, along with the moans that neither Beta Lucy nor Gamma Vincent held back.\* 



\*The sweat shone in the dim light on Vincent’s back while his muscular body forced Lucy’s slender figure under him, thrusting in her hard and fast. Lucy dug her nails uncontrollably into the skin on his back, leaving long, red marks on it.\* 



\*Usually, it would have disturbed him, but this time, it made him proud to give so much pleasure to the beautiful Beta. Her long blond hair, brown eyes and perfect shape attracted most of the werewolves in the pack, but only a few of them were brave enough to touch her or go close to her, even if she was flirting with them. Of course, they had a good reason for keeping their distance from her.\*



\*Lucy had reached her climax twice already, and even if Vincent started to feel exhausted, he wanted to give her more to prove that he was worth being in her bed. Like many werewolves in the pack, he knew Lucy's seductive behaviour, making so many wolves fall for her and end up in her bed. Therefore, he wanted to be the one who she would prefer to have sex with when she was in need.\*



\*He watched Lucy’s naturally sizeable breasts bouncing up and down. This view kept him so attracted that he couldn't help but lean closer many times to please her nipples with his mouth and tongue.\*



\*Each time he held a nipple between his teeth, gently pulling on it, Lucy's body trembled a little, and he could feel how her wetness was bathing his stiff shaft. At the same time, he pounded her even more intensively, hoping he would keep himself back from orgasming too soon. He moved from nipple to nipple, hearing Lucy's pleasure, which attracted him so much that he decided he wanted to finish between her round breasts, watching his seeds moisturize her soft skin.\*



""Faster! I am coming!"" Lucy moaned, giving him an order that he must obey.



\*Their moans were even louder, just like the sound of their bodies met with each thrust, when finally he saw her eyes rolling back and her gorgeous body tensed under him. Her moisture was all over his lower abdomen, and he couldn’t be more proud of himself for giving his Beta so much pleasure.\*



\*Hoping that he satisfied the Beta for tonight, he pulled out between her warm and wet inner walls, and he moved above her chest, putting his palms against the headboard of the bed.\*



\*Lucy knew what he wanted, and she was in the game, feeling grateful after her three orgasms. He moved his shaft between her breasts. Lucy pushed the big boobs together, massaging the stiff shaft that was wet from her juices, letting him get his reward. What's more, as she enjoyed being with him so much, she lifted her head to reach the head of his cck with her tongue when it appeared with each thrust, which made him moan louder. However, soon, his moans turned into gasping, and he shot his seeds between the perfect breasts with an audible groan. He was enjoying feeling his warm liquid mixing with the gorgeous Beta's wetness between the soft skin. He felt so empty like never before, and he hoped he could satisfy his Beta enough so she would give her other chances to prove his abilities.\*



\*Lucy was smiling as she knew what the Gamma were thinking of. Usually, the werewolves who satisfied him had the same look in their eyes, delighted, hoping to give them another chance to have sex with her. The three orgasms surprised her as well, so she thought she would let Vincent visit her often.\*



\*However, soon, her smile disappeared. She started frowning as a familiar scent, more potent than their arousal’s scent, hit her nose. Lucy was thinking for a moment. What got in her mind was impossible. She planned everything well, just like usual. That must have been her imagination, so she tried to calm herself. But the scent became more substantial, and her heart started pounding faster when she noticed Vincent's frown, as he could smell the fragrance. Her eyes widened in fear when she desperately tried to push him off of her, but it was too late.\* 



\*The door swung open, and the loud, furious growl made Vincent jump off her, meeting his worst nightmare. At that moment, he regretted falling for Lucy and being so weak; the beautiful she-wolf made him believe he could do such a thing without consequences.\*



\*The Alpha stood there himself. The one who had all the right to kill him for stealing someone belonged to him. He couldn’t say a word. His mind went blank as he heard Lucy’s yelling while hitting him, blaming him for raping her. Yes, the gorgeous she-wolf, who he had just satisfied three times in a row, now acted like he was the bad guy and she was a victim only.\*



\*But Lucy’s sudden turn couldn’t bother him then, as the Alpha, Lucy’s mate, walked over to him. First, he felt his powerful grip around his neck. Then he felt the bedside table’s corner hit his head badly. His blood leaked on the carpet, but he didn’t have time to do anything, as the Alpha punched him numerous times in the head. If the Alpha stopped for only a second, he would crawl on the floor, kiss his shoes, and beg for forgiveness, but that was too late. The pain he felt was unbearable, and he deserved it.\*



\*His open wounds made the Alpha’s fist bloody, but he didn’t seem to care about it, just like he didn’t care about the sound of his bone fractures either.\*



\*The Alpha gone mad. Seeing his beloved mate under someone else made him lose his mind. There was no longer a human side of him. He let his wolf control their body. The Gamma, compared to its Alpha, was weak. Vincent couldn’t do anything against him.\* 



\*Vincent became unconscious, lying lifelessly on the floor in his blood, but the Alpha still couldn't stop hitting him.\*



\*The old Alpha and Beta, Lucy’s father, appeared in the room, and they held the young Alpha. He wanted to brake free of their grip, and finish what he started, but finally the two elder werewolves won. They held the Alpha back from killing the half-dead Gamma.\* 



\*Lucy covered herself using a sheet and sobbed in a corner. She tried to show her weakest side, acting like a fragile, hurt she wolf.\*



\*When the two elders successfully stopped the young Alpha, she stood up, still sobbing, and walked to his mate, trying to hug him.\*



\*“I’m so sorry. This male Gamma was much stronger than me. I couldn’t help it."" she cried. ""I shouted, but no one heard me. Alpha, I feel so ashamed. I know it is hard for you as well, but please forgive me.”\*



\*“Forgive you? Never!” He shouted while gasping for air. He didn't realize that, but the Gamma's blood was all over on his clothes. “You are a fcking whre, don’t dare come close to me again!” He couldn’t hide how much pain he suffered from at that moment. His all world collapsed. He heard rumors about Lucy, but he loved her blindly. The Alpha couldn't believe that his beloved mate would be able to cheat on him. He treated her as his queen, his future Luna, and instead of enjoying the special treatment, she ashamed him in exchange.\*



\*“Son! Stop it!” his father shouted at him. After watching his daughter momentarily, the Beta walked to the Gamma, pulled him up, and threw his unconscious body out of the room.\*



\*“Take him into the prison, "" he ordered the guards, who patiently waited outside, appalled.They looked at each other in disbelief, as they would have expected them to call a doctor for him, but the guards held the Gamma quickly, and they took him away.\*



\*The Beta held his sobbing daughter inside the room and looked at the young Alpha.\* 



\*“You should have protected her better. How come an Alpha let its mate go through this? Where have you been? You should have been here next to her. How could I trust you from now on?”\*



\*“You don’t have to worry about that, Beta.” He stated. “I wouldn’t need your daughter, even if she would be the last female on earth. She is nothing more than a shameful liar, a slut\*.”



“Don’t dare talk about her like that,” the Beta shouted, and he took the first step towards him when they heard the old Alpha shout. “Enough!”



The Beta stopped and looked at the old Alpha with a frown. 



“I’ll investigate the entire case, but till then you all must calm down.” He said, but his son looked at his father in disbelief. 



“You don’t have to investigate the case, father. You would only waste your time. I don’t need her anymore.” The Alpha turned around to look into the sobbing Beta woman’s eyes filled with fear. 



“You will not exist for me from now on. Don't dare come close to me, or talk to me. You are nothing for me, and I regret that I have ever accepted you as my mate.” 



“Son!” His father shouted, but the young Alpha motioned him to let him speak.



“Beta Lucy Norman, I reject you as my mate and future Luna. Don’t dare to appear in my sight anymore. Never!” He shouted the last word like he was out of his mind. His father held him and dragged him out of the room as he saw the Beta was about to attack him, defending his sobbing daughter, who seemed close to fainting.



“Accept my rejection, you wh\*re!” The young Alpha shouted back before they would step out of the door. He wanted to continue, but his father forced him to leave.



“Never! I will never accept your rejection!” She sobbed while she laid her head on her father’s chest.



# Chapter 2 Olivia



\*\*8 years later\*\*



\*It was a rainy day, about three o’clock in the morning. It was a Friday, so London’s streets were full of drunk and drugged people who continued partying on the streets or trying to find their homes.\* 



\*However, the situation in the major hospital's emergency department worsened every minute. Most of the patients got there with alcohol poisoning, and some of them overdosed on some drugs. Many people got involved in fights, which caused broken bones or stab wounds. It seemed like the night was never-ending.\* 



\*“What happened to him?” a doctor pulled the curtain open and stepped to the bed—a man lay there, his arm full of fresh and dried blood.\*



\*“A deep but clear cut on the forearm, Dr. Flores.” A nurse responded to the attractive doctor.\*



\*Dr Olivia Flores was a surgeon in the A&E department. Although she seemed young, her experience and manner of treating people made other doctors and nurses think she had been practising for much longer than she claimed. They weren’t wrong, but they never questioned her further.\*



\*Olivia was a fantastic doctor and very attractive as a woman. She had a slender figure but wasn’t too tall or short. Olivia had natural black hair and eyes like the coldest blue ocean. Her skin was white like she had never seen the Sun, but her full lips were red like blood. She was like a living porcelain doll. Many doctors tried to get close to her, but she refused all of them because she didn’t want to get involved in a relationship.\*



\*She didn’t seek a partner. Even if she was lonely and missed being loved, she couldn’t let others know what she was. She couldn’t let any human realise her ice-cold skin, her no-beating heart and her actual age. Olivia must have kept a secret that the feared creatures from horror movies, vampires, existed, and she was one of them.\*



\*She had a few affairs in her life. She tried to be with other vampires, but their relationships always failed, primarily because of their different eating habits.\*



\*She tried to move into vampire communities, but again, she couldn’t bear the barbeque parties, as the vampires called them, where humans were the threats. Olivia would never forget those nights when the group leader brought some innocent humans to the premises. The fear was written on their faces, and to hear them beg for their life and then cry for their mothers damaged her for her long life. He left immediately, and she promised never to try to live again in such a community.\*



\*But she was a young vampire, only about two hundred years old back then. How old was she now? She couldn’t tell. She stopped counting it after four hundred years while moving around the world.\* 



\*Especially after experiencing the fear of human beings, Olivia never wanted to hurt people, but she needed blood, of course. There was a period in her life when she lived with other creatures, living the same life as her. She found a small community where she felt good again. In a few years, she became part of a group of scientists trying to know creatures other than humans. They examined the bodies and helped them heal when all the doctors failed, but the community members also had the chance to do experiments. Her target was to find a way to live without blood, but she was unsuccessful. During these years, she only practised bearing her hunger, but she did that very well. She needed a sachet of blood each half year, which she always took from the hospital secretly. That was why it was so beneficial for her to be a doctor in the human world.\* 



\*Because she never looked older, she never spent over ten years in one place. Moving was always a lot of work, but it was necessary, as humans couldn’t know their existence. Many believed they existed, but they weren’t allowed to confess that.\*



\*One of the communities’ leaders could execute vampires who couldn’t keep the rules. And that was all the vampire’s biggest fear, including Olivia.\*



\*“I cleaned the wound. A nurse will bandage it for you, Mr. Rest your arm for a few days, keep the bandage dry and clean. My colleagues will inform you when to come back to change it. If it hurts too much, you can take some ibuprofen.”\*



\*“Thank you, Dr.” The human looked at Olivia with gratefulness. Probably, he was involved in a fight, but she didn’t ask. His wound wasn’t serious at all, so there was no need to involve the police.\*



\*She closed the curtain and went to the following folder. Then, she sighed and went to see the next patient.\*



\*At eight o’clock in the morning, she sat down in the hospital’s restaurant. Of course, she bought a coffee, which she never drank, but she needed a break. Not that she was tired physically. She treated twelve lightly injured people, a very ill little girl, and she had three life-saving operations. Even though she was a vampire and stronger than a human, she also loved to sleep. That helped her mind rest, and she hadn’t slept for three days. She looked around and smiled at the thought that she would miss this place.\* 



\*“Are you done?” Another doctor stepped at her table. She looked up at her and nodded with a smile. “Yes.”\*



\*“Well, I wish you good luck in the new place. Hopefully, it won’t be as mad as this one.”\*



\*“Thank you, Laura.” Olivia smiled back. It was her last day here, and she sat at her table with the coffee she would throw away.\* 



\*After she forced herself to stand up, she took her belongings and walked down the hall. At the main reception, everyone said farewell to her and wished her luck with her new job.\*



\*Even though she had experienced it so many times, she still loved the feeling that people would honestly miss her.\*



\*She walked out and sat in her car. Then, she turned on the engine and drove back to her apartment.\*



\*When she stepped inside, the apartment echoed because of the empty rooms and places, just like usual. Even if she was all packed, that changed nothing in the flat. She didn’t like to buy stuff. Because she moved a lot, she didn’t want to be attached to anything.\* 



\*She laid down on her inflatable mattress, and she fell asleep quickly.\*



\*The following day, she showered and got dressed. Then, she had a last look at the place where she had spent the previous ten years. With a sad smile, she stepped out and walked down with her only luggage in her hand. She put the items into her car and drove to her next home, Middlesbrough.\*



\*It wasn’t unfamiliar to her. She used to live here a long time ago.\* 



\*She rented out the flat a few weeks ago. She knew where she was going. When she arrived, she looked around, satisfied. This was her home for the next ten years. She hesitated a lot before moving here, as it wasn’t too far from London, but she wanted to move to the north so much that she only hoped she wouldn’t meet anyone from her past ten years.\*



\*She lit some candles and lay in the bath. Even though her body was naturally cold, she enjoyed the warm water. She loved feeling her body warmed up, and it relaxed her.\*



\*The next day was her first day in the new hospital. It was huge, just like the one in London, but this one looked colder. She had worked here before, but the entire building looked different at that time.\*



\*“May I help you?” A young blonde receptionist asked her when she stepped to the desk. Olivia smiled at her.\*



\*“Yes. My name is Dr. Olivia Flores. This is my first day here.”\*



\*“Oh…” the receptionist looked at her surprised. “I call someone to come. Which department?”\*



\*“A&E.”\* 



\*As the woman stood up and walked to another phone, Olivia’s gaze was fixed on someone. He stood there, and he probably heard everything.\*



\*When their gazes met, Olivia felt something unfamiliar. She couldn’t describe that feeling, but her heart probably would have beat crazily if her heart had beat.\* 



\*The man’s gaze remained serious, and he didn’t look away. They were staring at each other for a few moments. The man had black hair and an unusually muscular body, and he was a little taller than Olivia. His skin was white, but probably he enjoyed the Sun a lot, and his eyes were brown. She felt like the air froze, and she could only think of what he was and that they would work in one place.\*",1,1745837953.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1k9skw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/1k9skw3/review_after_3_months/,Review after 3 months,"I’ve struggled with seborrheic dermatitis (SD) since I was 20, and now at 33, I've tried just about everything—countless creams, shampoos, you name it. I’ve even changed my clothes, detergents, home, and country, but nothing seemed to work.

**What I changed 3 months ago:**

* **Gluten-free diet**: I switched to a gluten-free diet for a month.
* **Quit smoking**: I smoked for 7 years, but stopped 6 months ago. While not directly related to SD, it was part of a broader effort to improve my health.
* **No alcohol**: I was drinking 1-2 beers a month and stopped completely. Honestly, my body didn’t crave alcohol, so it was an easy decision.
* **No dairy**: I also cut out dairy entirely.
* **Proper Sleep**: I sleep 7-8 hours per day.
* **Nuts:** I stopped eating nuts as they are sometimes triggering flare ups
* **Processed Food:** Totally gone. I dont even look at them anymore

**Results after 30 days:** I experienced only minor flare-ups, with about 80% of the issue under control.

**What I changed after that:**

* Switched to **Vichy Dercos** (Oily Scalp version) shampoo. (15$ in my country)
* Started using **Uriage DS** cream daily. (10$ in my county)

**Results after 3 months:** If I eat gluten or dairy, it doesn’t flare up immediately, but if I indulge heavily over a few days (like 3 days in a row), it does come back. A slice of bread or a bit of cheese doesn’t seem to trigger it, but if I have coffee or cheesecake? That’s when the flare-ups happen.

  
Then consulted two dermatologists, both from different countries, to ask about any potential long-term side effects of using Vichy Dercos and Uriage DS.

Both doctors shared their insights:  
Dercos: You may use twice per weak  
Uriage: No problem with daily usage

You may now ask me, “If I don’t wash my hair every day, it gets either dry or oily, and a flare-up occurs. Is that normal?”

I was in the same situation until I changed my diet. Now, I wash my hair every 3-4 days because it no longer gets red, itchy, oily, or flaky—it looks great.

A few days ago I started to take Vitamin D and B12 to see if it will make more improvement but I share updates in 3 months again.

Do I eat gluten now? of course but minimal. If I eat a sandwich, I give 3 days for me body to process then eat again. Not as a daily habit.

Do I eat dairy now? Milk no (I hate milk) but a few cheese time to time thats all.

So basically our body says: Eat green, eat healthy, sleep well and dont strees that much. Another note: If I eat glute/dairy/process food etc shampoo and face cream doesnt help at all :) so this is coming from ''inside''

you know that feeling? monday morning, you crack open the laptop, take a deep breath, and BAM. email explosion. slack's already a dumpster fire. urgent pings flying left and right. the plan you maybe kinda sorta thought about over the weekend? instantly vapourised.

you spend the next three hours just playing whack-a-mole with everyone else's 'emergencies'. answering questions, putting out fires, getting pulled into stuff you didn't even know was happening. by lunch, you feel like you've run a marathon but somehow haven't moved an inch on the stuff *you* actually needed to get done. the whole week already feels behind schedule.

it's insane, right?

took me way too long, like *years*, to figure out the sneaky little trap here. it's not just the sheer volume of crap hitting us on monday. it's our gut reaction to immediately dive headfirst into the noise. **we open email first. we check slack first. we instantly start reacting.**

and doing that? it's like handing the steering wheel of *your* week over to literally everyone else before you've even figured out where you're trying to go. you start the day reacting, and you never really stop. everything feels urgent, nothing feels important.

so here's the thing that kinda clicked for me, maybe it helps someone else feeling that monday chaos: **defend your first 30-60 minutes like your life depends on it.**

like, physically *don't* open outlook or slack right away. i know, it feels weird, almost irresponsible at first. the urge to check is HUGE.

but instead, use that first little window to just... breathe. reconnect with *your* main goals for the week (even if it's just one big thing). figure out the *very first small step* you can take on one of *your* priorities. *then* maybe mentally prep for the incoming wave - what needs immediate attention vs what can wait?

only *after* you've kinda oriented yourself and set your own intention, *then* open the floodgates.

it sounds backwards, but starting with your own priorities, even for just 30 minutes, before reacting to everyone else's... it completely changes the feel of the day. you're filtering the noise through *your* plan, not just getting swept away by it.

it's not about ignoring people, just about getting your own bearings first so you're navigating the chaos instead of just drowning in it. made a huge difference for me in feeling less like a pinball machine all week.

anyone else wrestle with this? what helps you guys not let monday morning derail everything?",33,1745837002.0,managers,10,0.92,False
1k9sfvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1k9sfvp/cursed_reddit_story/,CURSED REDDIT STORY,"August 31, 2024.



I've always loved reading horror stories. They fascinated me, especially those with a macabre plot twist. I enjoyed reading them while sipping my coffee, but ever since that damned incident last month, I haven't been able to open a single story again.



That morning, as usual, I was browsing creepypasta subreddits while drinking my coffee. I'd practically read them all. But that day, something strange happened. Amid thousands of posts flooded with upvotes and comments, there was one story... with no likes, no comments. Completely forgotten. I clicked. I started reading.



***WARNING.***



The story was cliché. Nothing special. It seemed inspired by those old slasher films where teenagers get massacred. THE IRONY. Just another recycled story among so many. I finished reading and went to work. Another shitty day, with my boss yelling at me as usual.



When I got home, I noticed something strange. The front door was slightly open. At first, I thought I'd forgotten to lock it.



***STOP.***



I entered cautiously. My town wasn't known for high crime rates. I searched the entire house. Nothing out of the ordinary. I tried to forget about it and carry on with my night.



At 1 a.m., I woke up. The hallway light was flickering nonstop.



""Damn faulty wiring again..."" I muttered, going back to sleep.



Five minutes later, I woke up startled by the sound of plates shattering in the kitchen. Horror clichés are pure fiction, RIGHT?



I got up and went to the kitchen. Everything was a mess. I was organized. This wasn't normal.



As I picked up the broken plates, I saw marks... of blood. Messages written:



***YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE READ THAT STORY.***



My stomach turned to ice. How did someone know? This was always my secret hobby. I screamed. I called the police.



They arrived quickly. They collected blood samples. No signs of a break-in. The kitchen didn't even have a window.



Days later, the results: the blood was mine. But how? I wasn't injured. I had no history of sleepwalking. I didn't do drugs.



***OR DID I?***



The police dismissed it as a prank. They warned me. But the messages kept coming. Every night, in different places: on the bathroom mirror, on the bedroom window.



***I WARNED YOU.***



And it wasn't just messages. ""Accidents"" that could have been fatal started happening—coincidentally.



A brick fell out of nowhere, almost hitting me. A pitbull attacked me for no reason. I was nearly run over by a speeding car—I was the only pedestrian on the street. I slipped three times in the shower, with no explanation.



And then my house... caught fire. No cause. I lost everything.



Homeless, I got fired from my job. I had no peace. I moved back in with my parents, but I quickly realized I was putting them in danger.



Now I'm writing this on my phone. If you're reading this, understand: sooner or later, I won't be able to escape. This thing will get me. There's no use fighting.



The story I read... condemned me. And if you've read this far...

We love the area and the flat and we are now expecting our little one in a couple of months.

\- How much did time did you wait to up-size via capital gain (- taxes)? 2-5 years? Whats the normal?

\- How many of you did make over payments to reduce the mortgage vs safe extra money for new deposit?

\- How many of you did not end up selling the first home and still went for a bigger place? (I am very curious to know if this is still possible these days given how expensive London is)

PS: we know next year nursery will be like an extra mortgage but we have a comfortable mortgage for our TI now that allows us to do both. We need to renew it in 2 years btw. 

Thanks!

## Metal Fire Pit Materials: A head-to-Head Comparison

The material of your metal fire pit is arguably the most critically important factor in determining its durability, longevity, and aesthetic appeal. Let's explore the most common materials:

*   **Steel Fire Pit:** Steel is a popular choice due to its strength and affordability. It can withstand high temperatures and is relatively easy to work with, allowing for various designs. However, steel is susceptible to rust if not properly treated with a powder coating or other protective finish. Both stainless steel fire pit and standard steel options are common, each with pros and cons.Steel wood burning fire pit units offer a classic experience.

*   **Cast Iron Fire Pit:** Cast iron offers excellent heat retention and a classic, rustic look. It's incredibly durable and can last for many years with proper maintenance. However, cast iron is heavy and can be brittle, making it prone to cracking if subjected to sudden temperature changes or impact. Cast iron is less commonly used for portable fire pits, due to its weight.

*   **Copper Fire Pit:** Copper is known for its lovely patina and excellent heat conductivity. It's also naturally rust-resistant, making it a good choice for outdoor use. Though, copper is a more expensive option than steel or cast iron. Copper fire pits often make for an eye-catching decorative fire pit.

*   **Stainless Steel Fire Pit:** Stainless steel offers excellent corrosion resistance and a modern, sleek look. It's also relatively lightweight and easy to clean. However, it can be more expensive than regular steel and may not retain heat as well as cast iron.Stainless steel fire pits are a good choice for those living in coastal areas or other environments with high humidity.

## Fuel Types: Wood, Gas, propane, or Natural Gas

The type of fuel your metal fire pit uses will considerably impact its convenience, cost, and environmental impact.

*   **Wood Burning Fire Pit:** A wood burning fire pit provides a traditional campfire experience with the crackling sound and smoky aroma that many people enjoy. However, wood-burning fire pits require a readily available source of wood and can produce smoke and embers, which may be a concern in some areas.

They ignite easily, produce consistent heat, and don't generate smoke or embers. Gas fire pits can be fueled by propane or natural gas.

*   **Propane Fire Pit:** A propane fire pit is portable and easy to set up, making it a good choice for patios and decks.Propane tanks can be easily refilled or exchanged.

*   **Natural Gas Fire Pit:** A natural gas fire pit requires a permanent connection to a natural gas line,which limits its portability. However,it offers a continuous and cost-effective fuel source.Natural gas fire pits are typically more powerful than comparable propane units in terms of BTU output.

Here is some backround - in June 2024 I started noticing cloudy urine that did not correlate with hydration - seemed to come mainly after eating. In August I got a kidney panel, urinalysis. eGFR was 101, everything was in range except for a higher potassium, which was resolved with retesting (hemolysis is what happened). In August I also did a urine test which came back with trace blood, I have decided not to worry and got it retested in February 2025, dipstick came back negative for blood, microanalysis showed 1-2 rbc, but doctor said its nothing. I kept on having the cloudy urine and still do - but whenever I gave the samples, urine was not cloudy. Bacteria growth of the sample of urine came back negative. 
Basically all bloodwork and urine tests rulled out anything with the kidneys.
I got an ultrasound though because I started having mild right flank pain from the back side, ultrasound of my kidneys and bladder (for the cloudy urine) came back fine back in February 2025.
I am still continuing to see cloudy urine and have R flank discomfort. I bought some urinalysis strips to test the cloudy urine (its yellow in color but not see through) each sample I take comes back with Blood - all sorts of levels- 3+;2+ and 1+. But the blood is always there even when my urine is as clear as water. 
I am very concerned, what can cause this blood in urine? I have no symptoms of UTI, the strip does not show anything else abnormal just blood. I am not on my period, but period is due in 7 days if that means anything. I am worried about cancer or kidney failure. I am due to see urologist tomorrow because the cloudy urine and pain in right flank are not normal.
I have no history of urine systems cancer, although my grandpa died of stomach cancer in his 40s.
I have no high blood pressure, I am not overweight, I am at a complete loss.
I do have hashimotos with a tirad 4 nodule, had an MRI with contrast 1 week ago for my breasts, so not sure if contrast has anything to do with it as my symptoms stayed the same.
Very worried - need some insight on the flank pain with normal ultrasound and kidney function. I have no urgency or anything , I try to drink 2L of water daily, do not consume coffee. Any thoughts? Unable to sleep and function for the last 2 days ever since the tests I have done constantly shows blood in urine.
