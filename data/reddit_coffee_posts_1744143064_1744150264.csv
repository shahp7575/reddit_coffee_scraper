1juq0u0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1juq0u0,Need some help making table topper not tilt,"Hello all, 

I am need some help with finding a creative solution for this removable table topper I am working on. The idea was to mimic a leafed table with three removable boards that could be placed on our coffee table. The top consists of three 2‚Äô x 4‚Äô boards. 

They would clip together at the joints and use toggle clamps to make sure it won‚Äôt shift laterally. 

Where I am needing some help is finding a means to stop the boards from tilting when you lean on them. 

The goal of this topper is to have it be a non permanent addition to the coffee table, so attaching it to the coffee table permanently is not an option. 

Take a look at the pictures and let me know if I need to take any more. If you know of any hardware I can use or really any ideas it would be super helpful! 

Thanks!

My second question is if I seal it with a finish, would I have to worry about expansion and contraction of the wood? If I seal it with a sealant such as rubio monocoat then a clear layer of epoxy, would it still expand and contract? First time so still learning.

3. Loves pupcakes!! (See pic 3) peanut butter, bully sticks and strawberry yak chews. But if it‚Äôs food she‚Äôll have it! Especially if it‚Äôs YOUR food

4. Things the dog park is the best thing ever! (Pic 4) we even got her to try some of the agility equipment, so excited to see if we can build on that in the coming weeks and months. 

5. She likes to eat her bully sticks Lady and the Tramp style with her frenchie sister, Minnie (pic 5)

6. She adores Minnie, and Minnie adores her! It‚Äôs sooo lovely to see their bond and how they look after each other. As you can see in pic 6 & 7 Minnie is now Pepper‚Äôs PR manager and only allows pre-arranged photoshoots!

He seemed really nice and cool. After a lot of chatting, he told me he was a versatile top and I honestly told him that I didn't feel comfortable being a bottom, but that I was fine with anything else. We met for the first time at a coffee shop near my neighborhood, and today we went to his house. Before we got there, we flirted and I thought it could be an opportunity to try it again, since the first time I bottomed with someone hadn't been the best (and the reason for that is below). I got ready and went.

When we got there, he took me to the guest room (I think) which was tiny and even had TWO bicycles next to the bed. We kissed a little and he simply put on the condom, fucked me and came in literally 2 minutes. And that was it. There was no foreplay, nothing. He didn't even touch me properly. And even though I did EVERYTHING to prevent that from happening, as soon as he took off the condom, a secretion came out on him (it was kind of colorless, I don't know if it was because of the lubricant), but he let out an ""aaah"", came out asking for the whole roll of toilet paper, took me to the shower, asked me to ""finish"" there and then, he changed the bed sheets and, in the end, I didn't feel good about the situation at all.

I still kept comparing myself to him, because he was all ripped, his dick was much bigger than mine, and we talked a little afterward, but I just wanted to leave. Anyway, now I'm crying and feeling horrible. Have you ever been through something similar?

The newest additions at Davis Farmland are tiny, fluffy, full of energy, and a first for the organization. The farm welcomed sextuplet Finn lambs this spring, and while the breed is known to give birth to multiples, six is incredibly rare.


The lively bunch have been given names to match their energy: Coffee, Cold Brew, Latte, Expresso, Mocha and Chai.


Davis Farmland opens for the season April 17 and the new lambs are just some of the baby animals that have recently arrived.


""So far, we've got baby goats, lambs, kittens, alpacas and even a baby llama,"" said manager Nicki Sacco, adding this year they've seen a ""serious case of baby fever"" on the farm.


This year, the farm has added new farm-themed play areas full of hands-on activities. Later in the summer, it is expected to open a brand-new water spray park.


""This spring, families visiting Davis Farmland will get to meet the new lambs up close and learn about the importance of endangered/heritage breeds in farming and conservation,"" Davis Farmland wrote in a press release.


Endangered species and heritage breeds have long been a priority for Davis Farmland, which created a nonprofit, The Farmland Conservancy Inc., in 1995, to provide care for endangered farm animals. Currently, Davis Farmland houses the largest collection of endangered farm animals in the country including Highland cattle, Poitou donkeys, Nigerian dwarf goats, alpacas and camels.",2,1744149255.0,central_ma,0,1.0,False

Y/C had it all: designer everything, a penthouse view, and enough influencer clout to never worry about the real world.

A summer in the middle of nowhere, specifically, her grandmother‚Äôs dusty old ranch in Wyoming, where there‚Äôs no Wi-Fi, no decent coffee, and a whole lot of cows. She hates it.

Until she meets my character, a rough-around-the-edges rancher with piercing eyes, fire in his gut and a charming facade, he's known Y/C grandmother for years. What he doesn‚Äôt have time for is a bratty city girl who thinks life is a reality show. Still, somehow she keeps getting in his way, especially as her grandmother‚Äôs health takes a turn and Y/C forced to stay longer than planned.

However, things aren't going smoothly. The family‚Äôs ranch is under siege from a rival clan with deep pockets, dirty secrets, and a plan to flip the town into a commercial hellscape. Y/C might just hold the key to stopping them‚Ä¶ if the two of them can stop bickering long enough to work together.

1jupifq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jupifq,"A 1978 article describing 12-year-old Brooke Shields as a ""sultry mix of all-American virgin and wh*re"" - historical write-up included","Attached is a highly disturbing article taken from the February 1978 issue of the 'counterculture' magazine ‚ÄòHigh Times‚Äô. The author is ‚ÄúEd Dwyer‚Äù, who is also the founding editor of the magazine. Both the magazine and the author are active as of now. Here is Dwyer‚Äôs LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-dwyer-2b848b17](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-dwyer-2b848b17)

The film being brought up frequently, Louis Malle‚Äôs ‚ÄúPretty Baby‚Äù (1978), is perhaps one of the most risqu√© features to ever hit **American** cinemas insofar as underage nudity is concerned ‚Äì though *Nana (1983)* could rival this. Here is a plot summary from IMDb:

>In 1917, in the red light district Storyville, New Orleans, the prostitute Hattie lives with her twelve year-old daughter Violet (Brooke Shields) in the fancy brothel of Madame Nell, where she works. Photographer Ernest J. Bellocq (thirty years old) has an attraction to Hallie and Violet and he is an habitu√© of the whorehouse. One day, Madame Nell auctions Violet's virginity and the winner pays the fortune of US$400 to spend the night with the girl. Then Hattie marries a wealthy client and moves to Saint Louis, leaving Violet in the brothel alone. Violet decides to marry Bellocq and she moves to his house.

As you can see, the film itself has a direct theme of child prostitution ‚Äì there was even a sequence involving the auctioning of her ‚Äòvirginity‚Äô. It doesn‚Äôt end there though, there are multiple scenes of total and partial nudity; note that **all** these scenes feature incidental nudity, we will come back to this later. You may be somewhat surprised to learn that this film was produced completely legally, in fact, a Blu-ray version (albeit somewhat censored IIRC) exists and the film is preserved in the Library of Congress. On top of this, she later featured in the more well-known ‚ÄúThe Blue Lagoon‚Äù (1980), which also features her in underage nude scenes ‚Äì though at a less explicit degree compared to Pretty Baby. A deeper analysis of Pretty Baby can be seen here: [https://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/prettybaby.htm](https://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/prettybaby.htm)

Perhaps what‚Äôs even more disturbing is her notorious Playboy photoshoot of her posing nude in a bathtub, which was taken when she was TEN (1975). The Playboy publication was called Sugar ‚Äòn‚Äô Spice.

The grounds for both of these not being considered child pornography essentially boils down to ‚Äúartistic merit‚Äù, which is definitely a subjective matter IMO. If we head back to 1964, in the landmark Supreme Court case ‚ÄòJacobellis v. Ohio‚Äô. It was ruled that obscene content could be banned, but did not give a good definition for what it meant to be obscene. Justice Potter Stuart famously defined obscenity as ""I know it when I see it"". The case was actually as a result of Louis Malle's (yes, the Pretty Baby director) film *Les amants* *(1958)* being screened in the US.

In the 1973 Supreme Court case 'Miller v. California', the Supreme Court seeked to define the difference between obscene content which could be prohibited by law and content which was permitted by the first amendment. The important part is that it can be prohibited if it the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Under Miller, a producer could produce a film and as long as they could argue that it had artistic merit, it was protected as free speech by the first amendment. There was firm legal ground. It just had to be ‚Äòartistic‚Äô, when taken as a whole. This is why ""Pretty Baby"" was ostensibly written to be an actual good film; to pass the Miller test it had to have ‚Äòartistic merit‚Äô.

Some of you may be somewhat familiar with the fact that legal proceedings did take place in regards to the Playboy photos taken by Gary Gross. Here is a particularly relevant section from a Guardian article:

>Gross‚Äôs lawyers argued that his photographs could not further damage Shields‚Äôs reputation because, since they were taken, she had made a profitable career ‚Äúas a young vamp and a harlot, a seasoned sexual veteran, a provocative child-woman, an erotic and sensual sex symbol, the Lolita of her generation‚Äù. The judge concurred and, while praising the pictures‚Äô ‚Äúsultry, sensual appeal‚Äù, ruled that Gross was not a pornographer: ‚ÄúThey have no erotic appeal except to possibly perverse minds.‚Äù That decision was overturned by an appeals court, but in 1983 the original verdict in Gross‚Äôs favour was upheld. Gross, 71, continues to exercise his right to sell pictures of Shields.

Unfortunately, whilst Dwyer‚Äôs claim of ‚ÄúBrooke is the first serious actress to violate the preteen sex taboo‚Äù may hold true for the United States, it was FAR from the reality in Europe and beyond‚Ä¶

Italian [Eva Ionesco](https://pixeldrain.com/u/9xyV9sCw) was exploited by her mother from a very young age, from Wiki:

>At the age of 4\*, Eva became her mother's favourite photo model. Irina Ionesco's erotic photographs of her young daughter Eva have been a source of controversy since they first appeared in the 1970s. Eva also modelled for other photographers such as Jacques Bourboulon.\[6\]

>She is the youngest model ever to appear in a Playboy nude pictorial, since she was featured at age 10\* in the October 1976 issue of the Italian edition of the magazine in a set by Bourboulon. In that picture, she posed nude at a beach. Another of her nude pictorials, in the November 1978 issue of the Spanish edition of Penthouse, was a selection of her mother's photographs.

She featured in an absolutely absurd number of publications in various stages of nudity throughout her preteens; these were not some kind of black market publications but actual, reputable European magazines/papers. In the case of Der Spiegel, the internal title story was ‚ÄúDie verkauften Lolitas‚Äù en: The Sold Lolitas) with the subsection of ‚ÄúKinder auf dem Sex-Markt - Film-M√§dchen Eva Ionesco‚Äù (en: Children on the sex-market - movie-girl Eva Ionesco); so, they had an article on the exploitation of children and decided to victimize her further right on the front cover. That is fucked up.

She very notably featured in the Austrian-Italian 'film' *Maladolescenza (1978)*; this 'film' featured her completely nude and in simulated sex scenes multiple times at the age of **eleven**, along with another eleven-year-old actress ""Lara Wendel"" (who herself has a whole history). Unlike Pretty Baby, the scenes were obviously not ‚Äòincidental‚Äô and were sexually charged. These highly risqu√© films were unfortunately not uncommon at all at the time. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, movies featuring underage characters in sexual situations were released in all mainstream genres: arthouse movies, dramas, erotic dramas, comedies, sexy comedies (e.g. the Italian \*commedia sexy all'italiana\*) and exploitation movies. Just to name *very* few: *Piccole Labbra (Mimmo Cattarinich, 1978)* (52-year-old surgeon / 12-year-old girl), *L'immoralita (1978)*, *L'adolescente (1979)*, *Mimi (1979)*, *Beau-Pere (Bertrand Blier, 1981)* (34-year-old musician / 14-year-old stepdaughter), *The Little Girl in Blue Velvet* (Alan Bridges, 1978) (36-year-old writer / 12-year-old girl), *The Little Siren* (Roger Andrieux, 1980) (40-year-old mechanic / 14-year-old girl) literally anything that David Hamilton directed (Bilitis, Tendres Cousines, Laura, etc), Luchino Visconti's *Death in Venice* (1971) is one rare movie featuring a adult man pursuing a 15-year-old teenage boy... and many more - you get the idea. To rub salt into the wound:

>‚Ä¶Then we returned to the stifling and twilight heat of Rome. In the Piazza di Spagna, like a tramp, I had to sell my Barbies on a stall to tourists and because Irene \[her mother\] had pocketed all my earnings \[\~$1750 USD for her role in Maladolescenza\] at my expense in order to have a nice plastic surgery operation.

Recently, Eva Ionesco published a new book about her childhood, Les Enfants de la nuit (The children of the night) - a couple articles which reveal some of the content of said book:

[https://gonzai.com/eva-ionesco-proust-en-manteau-panthere/](https://gonzai.com/eva-ionesco-proust-en-manteau-panthere/)

The major take-away is that Eva was raped when she was only eleven, by a rock star with the first name of Gene, who also had sex with her mother (Irina). This apparently happened sometime after Eva featured in Maladolescenza and did her Italian Playboy shoot, in late 1976 or early 1977. He was around 25 years old. The other thing mentioned in the book is that Irina had previously offered Eva sexually to Roman Polanski in exchange for a part in his movie *Le Locataire (The Tenant)* when she was 10 years old, and that she was in fact sent to his room alone but he declined to go through with it, though she still got the role.

Luckily, her mother lost custody of her, following the release of the film.

>In 1977 her mother lost custody of her and Ionesco lived for a time with the parents of footwear designer Christian Louboutin who had already left home

Her experiences by no means ended there though, she continued posing suggestively for the camera and was dubbed ""Queen of Parisian nightlife"" at the age of 13. She ended up going in and out of various foster homes until an older boyfriend took her in at 16.

The sexual liberation and the general questioning of social mores of the late 1960s allowed active paedophiles to reframe their practices using a dual political discourse based on Marxism (against the domination of adults) and psychoanalysis (against sexual inhibition). Various arguments, historical and sociological, were put forward by these activists, who saw themselves as persecuted victims like Jews, communists, witches, and homosexuals. It benefited from a general tolerance to paedophilia when expressed in literary fashion: from Andr√© Gide to Gabriel Matzneff, there had been no shortage of 20th century writers who had celebrated their transgressions in their works, were praised for this, and never suffered legal or social consequences.

Paedophile activism found complacent ears in left-wing intellectuals, who, even when they were not paedophiles themselves, came to believe that it was part of a general political and social struggle, progressive and anti-capitalistic. Activist and writer Tony Duvert, for instance, presented himself as a ""liberator of the child"". In this discourse, children were oppressed by the society, by the family (a bourgeois concept), and paedophiles freed them. One article by the newspaper *Lib√©ration* called parents ""capitalists"" who ""owned"" children. In France, one important objective of this fight was to eliminate age consent laws. Paedophiles were able to convince and enlist a wide range of intellectuals from the fields of medicine, psychology, social sciences, and philosophy (like Michel Foucault and Ren√© Sch√©rer), as well as artists and journalists. There was a convergence between male gay activism and paedophile activism, through people like Guy Hocquenghem for instance. This was not limited to France: there were pro-paedophilia associations in other Western countries such as the NAMBLA in the US, the PIE (Paedophile Information Exchange) in the UK, the CRIES (Centre de recherche et d'information sur l'enfance et la sexualit√©) in Belgium, and the Enclave Kring and MARTIJN in the Netherlands.

Paedophile advocacy focused mostly on young boys, even when it talked about children in general. Its artistic expression was primarily literary: Tony Duvert was published by the highbrow Editions de Minuit and he won the Prix M√©dicis in 1973 for a book about a children brothel. However, those ideas gave a varnish of respectability for mainstream works featuring sexualized young people subject to the desires of adults. Publishers and film producers found that there was an untapped market there, and they allowed artists with such proclivities to find a much larger audience than before.

So, rather than focusing on so-called ""socratic"" relations between men and boys, the transposition into popular visual arts - photography and movies - , catered to an heterosexual audience: young girls ""seducing"" older men (or other girls), young boys being seduced by older women, or children/teenagers having sex with each other. Vladimir Nabokov's *Lolita* and its adaptation by Stanley Kubrick (1962), which predate this trend, are ironic works that did not romanticize such relations (the movie could not prevent the sexualisation of its title character, though, and the actress was two years older), but they helped popularize in several languages the term of nymphet invented by Nabokov, putting a name on a certain character type: the preteen or teenage girl who is, willingly or not, a magnet for adult men.

And here we must evoke the earlier-mentioned David Hamilton, a France-based British photographer who was incredibly successful from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s for his soft-focus pictures of ""nymphets"" wearing floppy hats and summer dresses, dreamy, blonde, willowy, often nude or partially nude. Hamilton's girls were ubiquitous in Europe and in North America in that period: they were displayed in mainstream magazines, books, calendars, postcards, posters etc. Indeed, Hamilton's ""romantic-not-erotic"" posters could be found at your local supermarket in some European countries, stuck between Disney characters and photographs of movie stars: they were a staple of teenage bedrooms at the time. The movie [*Piccole Labbra (1978)*](https://pixeldrain.com/u/ov5jv4dm) owes a lot to Hamilton's photographic style, as shown in the stills visible at the IMDb page. The actress of Piccole Labbra later went on to star in another highly-risqu√© film underage ""Nana: The True Key to Pleasure"".

Hamilton sold one million copies of *Dreams of a young girl (1971)*, one of his first photobooks, which consists of 140 pages of pictures of teenage girls in various stages of undress. The preface was written by Alain Robbe-Grillet, celebrity writer and herald of the cerebral *Nouveau Roman* genre in France. It starts as follows:

>A man with pale eyes, a hunter of dreams, goes seeking the new-winged butterflies of adolescence, barely emerged from their chrysalids. He catches them in big nets spread over the avenues of Ltibeck or Copenhagen, the campuses of Swedish high schools, the long beaches of the Baltic. He brings them carefully back, undamaged, and cages them in a vast secluded house - his house, - where he observes them at leisure.

A hunter indeed: in November 2016, several women testified that Hamilton had raped them when the modelled for him. Hamilton committed suicide.

Side note: one man who *did not* like Hamilton's ""blurred and unfocused"" art style was the also-earlier-mentioned Roman Polanski. After the French magazine *Vogue Hommes* had published an issue devoted to Hamilton, Polanski proposed to its editor to do a shoot to ""show girls as they really were these days‚Äîsexy, pert, and thoroughly human"", with pictures of five girls from different countries (*Vogues Hommes* later denied giving Polanski this assignement). This led to Polanski raping 13-year-old Samantha at the end of her second photo shoot. Both Polanski and Samantha Geimer, in their memoirs, tell that, after the rape, the director went to see Samantha's parents and showed them pictures of their topless daughter, and that he was surprised by the parents' unexpected cold reception. Geimer (2014) writes:

>There was something considered generally positive about erotic experience in the 1970s, even in the absence of anything beyond the sex itself. The idea was that emotional growth came about through an expanded sexuality - for both the person in power \*and\* the relatively powerless. This is the cultural paradigm Roman Polanski was sopping up in 1977.

Hamilton's highly recognizable style made him a household name, and he went to direct five movies between 1977 and 1984 - the first ones being commercially successful - featuring his preferred subject matter, eroticized teenage girls.

Situations where a ‚Äòprecocious‚Äô preteen/teenage girl falls in love with an adult man, or where an adult man is obsessed by a young girl were a staple of those stories, which became romanticized and to some extent normalized. *La seduzione* (Fernando Di Leo, 1973), *Le far√≤ da padre* (Alberto Lattuada 1974), *Appassionata* (Gian Luigi Calderone, 1974), and Oedipus Orca (Eriprando Visconti, 1976) all featured older men being seduced by a teenager, but the actresses were at least in their late teens or early twenties. Later movies were bolder and featured preteens and early teens, some of which were brought up earlier. 

Such movies also benefited from the willingness of certain families to lend their children to creators of sexualized artworks. In the case of *Maladolescenza*, the main actress was the aforementioned 11-year-old Eva Ionesco, whose life story exemplifies the sexual confusion of the times (she has since written books and directed movies about her experience). Ionesco claims in her second memoir, *Les enfants de la nuit*, that Irina tried to make Polanski (again, this man!) have sex with her, but that he refused as he found her too young (he gave her poppers though). Eva Ionesco's co-star in *Maladolescenza*, German actress Lara Wendel, played the title role the following year in *Little Girl in Blue Velvet* and later in ‚ÄúMimi‚Äù and Ionesco says that she was also considered for the former part. Eva (aged fourteen at the time) said that she intended to earn her high school diploma ‚Äúbecause you can‚Äôt make a living showing your ass all your life‚Äù (October 1979, Oui magazine). The early career or Nastassja Kinski is another example: she appeared topless at 13 in Wim Wenders' *The wrong move* (1975) and later in sexual roles before she was 18.

*Maladolescenza* (1977) is an extreme example of the trend: it featured preteen nudity, simulated sex between children, and the death of one of the children. Pier Giuseppe Murgia, the director of *Maladolescenza*, knew what he was doing: in 1960, he had written a novel about the sexual adventures of an adolescent boy, *Il ragazzo di fuoco*: Murgia had spent eight months in jail for obscenity. *Maladolescenza*, adapted from his second novel, was shot in Austria thanks to German funding, as Italian producers had refused to finance it. In May 1977, at the press conference for the presentation of the film, Eva admitted it was ""vulgar, shocking and useless"". But the movie still passed Italian censorship: ""And to think that among the judges there was a pedagogue!"", wrote \*La Stampa\* (5 May 1977). The same newspaper interviewed moviegoers in Turin the following month (\[\*La Stampa Sera\*, 25 May 1977\](http://archive.org/details/stampa-sera\_1977-06-15)):

>""\*Monotonous. The idea was good, but there is no story, there is nothing except some love scenes between kids.\*"" They are three friends, they work in a ?. ""\*I don't understand why they ban it for under 18 year olds, when the actors are 12\*"". ""\*I liked it, even though there was nothing exceptional\*"" concludes the third.

>We approach a distinguished couple who are no longer young: ""\*It's a nice film, with very beautiful natural scenes, woods, naked children\*"". Did it seem dirty to you? ""\*No. They are clean love scenes. But yes,\*"" he concludes, ""\*it's a film you can watch\*"". An elderly and distinguished gentleman: ""\*Disgusting, but... basically exciting; I certainly wouldn't send my daughter to see it\*"".

>We stop four young people, Loredana Agnelli, Laura Calamo, Franco Grieco and Giancarlo Porta; they are students and they all agree: ""\*It's a pretty boring film\*"". Is it pornographic, at least? ""\*No, although they will certainly withdraw it\*"". The porno children \[\*pornobimbi\*\]? ""\*They're pitiful. If this film grosses, it's only because of the publicity\*"".

>More people are coming, everyone wants to talk. ""\*It's one of those films that, once the sexual aspect is removed, nothing remains\*"", says Paolo Gaggio, an employee. But is this sexual aspect any good at least? ""\*Apart from the morbidity due to the young age, it's quite normal\*"". Wasn't the idea of \*pornobimbi\* therefore a good one? ""\*Yes, but they could have exploited it in a smarter way. The trouble is that the newspapers talked too much about it,\*"" Eugenio Firpo replies.

>""\*If I had a son like that,\*"" echoes Giancarlo Tibotta, ""\*I would disown him.\*"" What do you think of Eva Ionesco? ""\*Very unpleasant,\*"" many replied.

So we can see here a relative indifference to what would provoke absolute outrage today. To be clear, the movie had a limited career in other countries and had to be severely edited to be shown. Two countries have explicitly banned it at this present time: Germany and the Netherlands.

There was in the 1970s-1980s a growing confusion about what could be shown or not, about what was right or not (were naked child actors OK? was paedophilia OK?). The times were changing fast and there was an actual demand for ""liberated"" artworks with sexual content, that producers were willing to meet, and they found parents agreeing to put their children in those ‚Äòartwroks‚Äô. Movies featuring preteens and teenagers in sexual situations were popular for more than a decade and some extreme ones, like *Maladolescenza* and *Piccole labbra* managed to get through censorship during a relatively brief period. Other extreme movies in terms of physical/mental violence like *Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom* (Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1975) and *Cannibal Holocaust* (Ruggero Deodato, 1980) were also experimented with for shock value.

Even with some more popular and critically acclaimed films from that time period, one can spot the trend upon investigation. For instance, ‚ÄúLeon: The Professional‚Äù. The director initially wanted much more risqu√© scenes involving Mathilda; it took Natalie Portman‚Äôs parents putting their foot down to prevent this from happening, but one can‚Äôt ignore the several somewhat risqu√© remnants in the extended international cut. The director himself (Luc Besson) is a disturbing individual, he had a relationship with a twelve-year-old (Maiwenn) when he was twenty nine, he later married her. Maiwenn claims in the DVD extras of Leon that the film was actually based on her relationship with Besson! Maiwenn is the sister of Islid, who featured in the French short film *La Puce (1999)*, featuring extended underage simulated sex scenes. Besson later married Milla Jovovich, who starred in the sequel to ‚ÄúThe Blue Lagoon‚Äù (the Brooke Shields film from earlier).

Even outside films and magazines, we can still see this disturbing trend. For instance, the cover art of ‚ÄúVirgin Killer‚Äù album by the German rock band ‚ÄúScorpions‚Äù featured complete nudity of a nine-year-old girl ‚Äì released in 1976. The album had to be re-released with different cover art for certain countries. The presence of the image on the UK Wikipedia actually led to the site being classed as child pornography, leading to Brits being unable to edit Wikipedia for four days!

Please do not attempt to contact me for links to material (Shield's/Ionesco's photos, or any of the films I mentioned); I do not possess such material, all write-up research was conducted via books, articles and anecdotes - not the material itself. Anyone who attempts to do so will immediately be reported to a relevant local/international authority.",14,1744148738.0,AllThatIsInteresting,6,1.0,False
1jupicg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jupicg/pavoni_ebr_12_worth_maintaining/,Pavoni EBR 12 -- Worth Maintaining?,"Hi everyone,

Two contextual FYIs:

(1) This post isn't strictly about buying, because I already have the machine. Thus the no 'Buying Advice Needed' flair.

(2) I am an espresso n00b. Be gentle.

I was given a Pavoni EBR 12 (manufactured 2005) for free, though it required some minor repairs to get it working. My repair guy tells me something is wrong with a valve inside it that I don't strictly need to fix to use the machine, and he also tells me that he tried the machine himself while it was in his shop and he loved the coffee it made. But at the same time, he also advised me that if I ever did feel the need to fix the valve, I may as well just throw out the machine and get a new one because the repair would cost more than the value of the machine on the market (allegedly because it could involve having to repair the entire grouphead, find old out-of-production parts, etc.).

Let's suppose he's correct about the cost of the repair exceeding the market value of the machine. (He estimates the market value is sub-$100.) Even so, if he himself is telling me it's a good machine that makes excellent espresso, why wouldn't I want to maintain it? I mean, if the repairs come out to $4000 or something, I get it, just spend the money on something fancier; but my understanding is \~$500 is considered a pretty good price for a machine that will make halfway decent espresso. So who cares if the machine would only fetch $75-$100 on eBay but a repair might cost, say, $200 or $300?

Me(f17) my sister (f15) and my mom (f37) moved in with ""Mat""(m55 fake name) almost six years ago, my mom met him on a dinner party and they fell in love. So we moved in when i was 12 about to start the 7th grade, moved to a different city and i left all my friends behind which was hard for me bc i have social anxiety and i was scared to talk to new ppl. So before they met i was a kind of lazy child, i didn't like doing anything in the house so it was the first thing that Mat tried to change, and i mean there is nothing wrong with that but bc he isnt my father and i barely knew this man it was rough. We had a lot of fight about it while growing up and my sister had them too even though she was younger and calmer than me. Ik there is nothing wrong to teach the child to help take care of the house but there is a wrong way. 
When i was 15 he finally started to back down from discipline me but there were still some fights and judgment from his side, he judged me for every little thing, from that i eat too much cookies and fat shaming me to telling me that my short hair is too ugly. I was emotionaly drained. But some how the relationship between me and Mat started to get better when i was 16, maybe bc my sister whom i fought with all the time moved to a boarding school. But as fast as it started to get better it started to get even worse. 
(Forgot to mention that my mom and Mat birth two baby sisters that im helping a lot with too and all my schedule with friends or school or work is about when they need me, they are 5 and 3)

Every Friday we cook a family dinner, im off school so i wake up early enough too take the dog out wash dishes and help with cooking. Mat is the main cheff of the house and im obligated to help him. 
So fast forward to last Friday, my sister came along with a friend and took my room so i had to sleep on the couch. Tuesday night i washed the dishes 'till 1am so i went to sleep really late, on Friday morning i was woken up at eight with a coffee machine which i can understand why its loud my Mat decided to open the tv too and smash his coffee glass really strong on the table, hw just stared at me and didn't care that i was trying to sleep, half an hour past before he closed the tv and dressed up to go to the market to buy groceries for the cooking then i gave up already for trying to go back asleep (im a light sleeper, so i wouldn't fall asleep anyway) he saw me sit up and started to list all the things he wanted for me to do before he comes back, i literally just ""woke up"" so i told him to text me it bc i will forget and he told me to call him instead. Bc i slept so little i was feeling like a zombie, it was a long week for me that i worked and had school so i was really tired and needed some sleep. When he came back i helped him but after some time i started to fell dizzy-like and my head was heavy so when i noticed that he didn't need me that much i went to my room to lean my head a bit (on my sister's bed which was my bed anyway) and when he called me i came too help. At one point he started to get mad at me that he have to call me every time so i would come, (my sister and her friend was sitting on the couch in front of him) and bc i was tired i didn't want to fight so i just told him ""i went to lean my head, I'm really tired and i don't feel good, but im here so what do you need?"" Really calmly, and he freaked bc i didn't feel good! He told me that im always tired, which im not but maybe from time to time bc of my period or other stuff, i mean im a human being too and im not beige and something is always hapening in my life in i like it or not!! Am i right? 
So i just asked him again what did he need and gave him, but he thought that i was being aggressive (it almost fell of my hand and i had to catch it) and started screaming at me. Told me that im a bitch and to get out from the house. 
My plan was always to finish school and move to my grandma which is a hour and a half away from the school and i don't want to wake up at 5am to be there on time. 

So to be clear, i don't think that i was fair with him when i was younger, we did fought bc of my actions, but this time ik im not wrong.
My mom talked to me at Friday, we were talking all day until the dinner that i did attented even if i was mad, and she finally understood my side, the fact that im emotionally drained from him and the unloved feeling i get from him but i did learn that she did tryed to stop some of his actions but unsecseed.
Four days have passed from Friday, two of them i was staying in my boyfriend's house bc the couch was uncomfortable (not my first time sleeping there) but when i came back home he ignored me completely, not like i wanted to talk to him but the basic hi is not an option for him anymore. And i refuse to say sorry bc i don't think it was my fault and i dont really wanna deal with his shit anymore. 
Im trying to find a place to stay until the school ends amd then move to my grandma, but i dont really have any options but ik i cant stay here longer. Im turning 18 in a month but i live in a country where you have to go to the army bc of that my options are limited.",1,1744148722.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

# Prompt-to-Multiple Assets Engine

Efficiency is key, right? This engine takes a single idea or prompt and multiplies its potential. Enter one concept, and Ghibli Studio AI can generate a variety of related assets. For instance, a prompt for a fantasy character could yield not just the character design, but also potential logos featuring the character, social media thumbnails, banner images, and more, all maintaining that consistent Ghibli style. It saves time and helps build a cohesive visual identity across different formats.

# Built-in Canva-Style Editor

Generating images is one thing, but customization is often needed. Ghibli Studio AI includes an integrated editor with a drag-and-drop interface, reminiscent of popular tools like Canva. This allows you to tweak the generated assets directly within the platform. You can adjust colors, add text overlays, modify layouts, combine elements, and fine-tune the visuals until they perfectly match your vision, all without needing separate, complex editing software.

# Ghibli Coloring Book Creator

The appeal of coloring books, especially those with intricate and charming designs, is undeniable. This tool specifically helps you create pages or entire books filled with Ghibli-style line art, ready to be colored. These can be compiled into printable PDFs or digital files, creating a product that's highly sellable on platforms like Etsy or Amazon KDP, tapping into the popular adult coloring book market.

# Cartoon Character Generator

Need unique characters for branding, merchandise, storybooks, or animations? The Cartoon Character Generator focuses on designing distinct personalities in that cinematic, Ghibli-inspired style. You can generate multiple character concepts quickly, providing a foundation for mascots, protagonists, or supporting figures that carry that specific artistic appeal.

# Cloud-Based Dashboard

Accessibility is a major plus. Ghibli Studio AI operates entirely in the cloud. There‚Äôs nothing to install or download. You just log into your dashboard from any device with an internet connection ‚Äì whether it's your desktop computer (Windows, Mac, ChromeOS), tablet, or smartphone. Your projects and the tools are always available wherever you are, making it convenient to work on the go or switch between devices.

# 3. Who Can Benefit from Ghibli Studio AI?

The versatility of Ghibli Studio AI makes it appealing to a wide range of users, both creative professionals and those just starting out.

* Content Creators: YouTubers constantly need eye-catching thumbnails to draw viewers in. Social media influencers require unique visuals to make their posts stand out. Bloggers can enhance their articles with custom Ghibli-style illustrations. This tool provides a quick way to generate these necessary visual assets without breaking the bank or spending hours designing.
* Freelancers and Agencies: Graphic designers, marketing agencies, and branding specialists can use Ghibli Studio AI to quickly generate concepts for clients. Whether it's initial logo ideas, branding elements with a specific aesthetic, or mockups to showcase designs on products, the tool can speed up the workflow and offer a unique style option that clients might love.
* E-Commerce Sellers: If you run an Etsy shop, a print-on-demand business, or sell through platforms like Amazon KDP or Shopify, Ghibli Studio AI is a goldmine. You can generate original designs for t-shirts, mugs, posters, phone cases, and more. The Mockup Generator helps create professional product listings, while the Storybook and Coloring Book Creators allow you to produce digital or physical products to sell directly.
* Authors and Educators: Children's book authors can illustrate their stories beautifully. Graphic novelists can generate panels quickly. Teachers can create engaging, visually appealing educational materials, worksheets, or classroom decorations with that charming Ghibli touch. It makes visual storytelling and material creation much more accessible.
* Beginners and Entrepreneurs: Perhaps the most significant group who can gain from this tool are those without traditional design skills or big budgets. If you're starting a business, a blog, or a social media channel, professional-looking visuals are necessary. Ghibli Studio AI offers a cost-effective way to create high-quality, stylized assets without needing to learn complex software or hire expensive designers. It levels the playing field.

# 4. Financial Opportunities with Ghibli Studio AI

Beyond just creating visuals for personal use or existing projects, Ghibli Studio AI opens up several avenues for generating income. The included commercial rights mean anything you create is yours to sell.

* Selling Digital Products: The most direct route is creating and selling digital goods. Think printable Ghibli-style wall art, downloadable coloring books, complete children's storybooks (as PDFs or ebooks), digital sticker sets, or graphic elements for other creators. Platforms like Etsy are ideal for these kinds of products.
* Offering Design Services: If you enjoy using the tool, you can offer specialized freelance services. Businesses and individuals might hire you to create Ghibli-style logos, branding packages, social media graphics, custom illustrations, or character designs using the app. You can charge for your time and the unique assets you produce.
* E-Commerce Applications: Leverage the Mockup Generator and asset creation tools to fuel a print-on-demand business. Design unique Ghibli-inspired graphics and sell them on t-shirts, hoodies, mugs, posters, phone cases, tote bags, and more through platforms like Printify, Printful, Redbubble, or your own Shopify store. You handle the design; they handle production and shipping. You could also self-publish coloring books or storybooks created with the tool on Amazon KDP.
* Building a Personal Brand: Consistent, high-quality visuals help build brand recognition. Use Ghibli Studio AI to create a unique and memorable aesthetic for your own blog, YouTube channel, social media presence, or small business. A strong visual identity can attract followers, customers, and opportunities.

# 5. Step-by-Step Guide to Using Ghibli Studio AI

Getting started with Ghibli Studio AI seems refreshingly simple, designed for ease even if you're not tech-savvy.

1. Accessing the Dashboard: Since it's cloud-based, there's no installation. You just log in to the Ghibli Studio AI dashboard using your credentials through any web browser on any device. It‚Äôs ready to go immediately.
2. Generating Assets: This is where the magic happens. You have two main options:
   * Text Prompt: Type in keywords or a descriptive phrase detailing the Ghibli-style visual you want (e.g., ""whimsical flying ship over a Ghibli town,"" ""cute forest spirit holding a lantern"").
   * Image Upload: You can also upload an existing image, and the AI will attempt to transform it into the Ghibli aesthetic. The AI engine then processes your input and generates the corresponding asset(s) in seconds.
3. Customizing Designs: Once you have your initial generated visual, you can use the built-in editor. This drag-and-drop interface lets you refine the image. You might want to change some colors, add text (like a title for a storybook or a slogan on a mockup), adjust the composition, or combine elements from different generated images. It offers a good degree of control for personalization.
4. Exporting and Selling: When you're happy with the final design, you can export it. The platform likely offers various standard formats (like JPG, PNG, PDF). Because full commercial rights are included, you can immediately use these exported assets. Upload them to your online store, use them in client projects, publish them in your books, post them on social media, or print them on merchandise.

# 6. Ghibli Studio AI Funnel Breakdown (Upgrades and OTOs)

Ghibli Studio AI offers a main product and several optional upgrades (One-Time Offers or OTOs) that add more features or resources. Here's a look at the structure:

* Front-End (FE): Ghibli Studio AI ($19)
   * This is the core product giving you access to the main features: the HD image generator, storybook builder, mockup generator, multi-asset engine, editor, coloring book creator, character generator, and cloud dashboard. It includes unlimited usage and commercial rights for a one-time price.
* OTO 1: DFY 100k Prompts ($37)
   * Provides a massive library of 100,000 pre-written prompts specifically designed for generating high-quality Ghibli-style assets. This can save time and spark inspiration.

   * A 'Done For You' service where the team helps set up your Ghibli Studio AI environment for potentially faster results, possibly including personalized guidance or templates.
* OTO 3: Unlimited Lite ($47)
   * Likely removes certain limitations that might exist in the Front-End version, offering broader capabilities or higher generation quotas, though the FE is already advertised as unlimited. Clarification might be needed here.
* OTO 4: Niche Mastery Kit ($37)
   * A toolkit focused on helping users identify and target profitable niches for their Ghibli-style creations. Could include market research tools, trend guides, or niche-specific prompt packs.

# 7. Pros and Cons of Ghibli Studio AI

Based on the information available, here‚Äôs a look at the potential upsides and downsides:

# Pros:

* Affordability: The front-end product is offered at a low one-time price ($19 during launch), which is very competitive compared to subscription-based AI image tools or hiring designers.
* Versatility and Ease of Use: It combines multiple tools (image generation, mockups, storybooks, etc.) into one platform with a user-friendly interface. It's specifically marketed towards non-designers.
* Unlimited Usage: The core offer promises unlimited asset generation without monthly fees or per-image costs (API tokens), which is a huge plus for heavy users.
* Full Commercial Rights: This is critical. You own what you create and can sell it without worrying about licensing fees or restrictions.
* Niche Focus: It targets the highly popular and specific Ghibli art style, catering to a clear market demand.

# Cons:

* Limited Style: Its main strength is also a limitation. It's focused *only* on the Ghibli style. If you need diverse art styles (photorealistic, abstract, cyberpunk, etc.), you'll need other tools.

# 8. Competitive Edge of Ghibli Studio AI

How does Ghibli Studio AI stack up against other popular AI image generators and design tools?

* Against MidJourney, DALL-E: These are powerful, general-purpose AI image generators capable of many styles. However, they often involve learning specific prompting techniques (like Discord commands for MidJourney), can have steeper learning curves, and usually operate on a credit or subscription basis, which can get expensive. Ghibli Studio AI's edge is its specific focus on the Ghibli style, its claimed ease of use, the integrated suite of tools (mockups, storybooks), and the one-time payment model. It aims to do one style *really well* and make it accessible. The source even mentions competitors crashing or pausing similar features, suggesting Ghibli Studio AI might offer a more stable or dedicated solution for this particular niche.
* Against Canva: Canva is an excellent graphic design tool for non-designers, focusing on templates, layouts, and simple editing. While Canva might have some AI features, it doesn't specialize in generating original artwork from prompts in a specific artistic style like Ghibli. Ghibli Studio AI complements Canva rather than directly competing on all fronts. Ghibli creates the unique base artwork; Canva could potentially be used for further layout or typography work if needed, although Ghibli Studio AI has its own editor.
* Dominating the Niche: The core competitive advantage seems to be its specialization. The demand for Ghibli-style visuals is strong across social media, merchandise, and content creation. By providing a dedicated, affordable, and easy-to-use tool specifically for this aesthetic, Ghibli Studio AI positions itself to capture a significant share of this niche market that other, more generalized tools might not serve as effectively or efficiently.

Using one of these codes during checkout can lower the initial cost even further. The affordability, combined with the promise of unlimited use and commercial rights, makes the value proposition quite strong, particularly for those on a budget. Remember these discounts are only active during the specified launch window.

# 11. Bundle Deals and Bonuses

To add more value, especially during the launch phase, Ghibli Studio AI comes with a substantial package of bonuses. These seem geared towards helping users not just create assets, but also market and sell them effectively. While the full details of each bonus are extensive, here's a glimpse of the types of resources included:

* Affiliate Marketing Training: Guides and video tutorials on affiliate marketing strategies (Bonuses 1, 2, 8, 9).
* Traffic Generation: Tactics for driving visitors to your offers (Bonus 3).

Purchasing within this timeframe is presented as advantageous.

Furthermore, the extensive list of bonuses is often tied to the launch period as an extra incentive for early adopters. Acting before the launch ends is suggested to maximize savings and value.

# 14. Platform Compatibility

This universal accessibility makes it easy to integrate into almost any workflow or setup.

# 15. Should You Use Ghibli Studio AI?

Deciding if Ghibli Studio AI is right for you depends on your specific needs and goals.

* If you love the Ghibli aesthetic and need visuals in that specific style: This tool seems tailor-made for you. Whether for personal projects, content creation, or selling products, it directly addresses this popular niche.
* If you're a beginner or lack design skills: The emphasis on ease of use, the simple interface, and the lack of required technical knowledge make it an attractive option. It lowers the barrier to creating professional-looking stylized assets.
* If you're on a budget: The low one-time launch price is a major draw compared to subscription models or hiring artists. The unlimited usage adds long-term value.
* If you're an entrepreneur or creator looking for monetization opportunities: The commercial license combined with tools for creating sellable products (storybooks, coloring books, mockups for merchandise) provides clear pathways to generate income.

However:

* If you need a wide variety of art styles: This tool is specialized. For photorealism, different cartoon styles, or abstract art, you'll need other solutions.

For many content creators, small business owners, educators, authors, and hobbyists who admire the Ghibli look, Ghibli Studio AI appears to be a potentially valuable and cost-effective investment. It offers a focused solution to a specific, high-demand visual style.

1jupbma,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jupbma/the_job_was_simple_monitor_the_woman_in_room_6/,The job was simple: Monitor the woman in Room 6. She‚Äôs been asleep for 42 days.,"I took the job because I needed quiet.

I had just moved back into the city after a really bad year - breakup, job loss, a fire that took half of what I owned. I was couch surfing when I saw the listing. Overnight shift. Private sleep study. No experience necessary, just basic data entry and the ability to stay awake. I figured I‚Äôd get some peace, maybe save up enough to afford rent somewhere that didn‚Äôt smell like damp carpet and stale weed.

The company was called SomnoTech. I Googled them. Not much came up. One old article in a university medical journal talking about ‚Äúexperimental treatments in chronic sleep disorder recovery,‚Äù and a barebones website with a contact form. The building I was sent to looked more like an office for defunct insurance than a lab. Beige, windowless, buzzed me in through two locked doors. Everything inside was silent and clean. No logos. Just halls that didn‚Äôt echo.

They gave me a laminated badge and walked me to Observation Room 6. It had one long window, a chair, three monitors, and a clipboard. That was it. Beyond the glass: a white-walled room, padded corners, one hospital-style bed with a woman laying perfectly still on it. Wires across her scalp. Pulse oximeter. Blood pressure cuff. Breathing tubes. The usual. The kind of image you‚Äôd see in a medical drama.

Her name was Marla. That‚Äôs all they told me.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not in a coma,‚Äù the lead technician - Dr. Ellis - said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs asleep.‚Äù

I asked how long.

He said, ‚ÄúForty-two days.‚Äù

That was when I almost walked out. But the pay was too good, and I told myself it was harmless. Just keep a log. Note her REM cycles. Don‚Äôt go in the room.

They emphasized that. Over and over.

**Never enter the room.**

I asked what would happen if she woke up.

Dr. Ellis paused for too long before he answered,

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not expected.‚Äù

That first night, nothing happened.

She lay still, vitals normal. Every couple hours her eyes flickered beneath the lids. Standard REM activity. Once, around 2:30 a.m., her hand twitched. I logged everything. I didn‚Äôt sleep, didn‚Äôt even look away much. Just sat and stared, drank vending machine coffee, and listened to the soft beep of monitors that never changed.

It wasn‚Äôt until the third shift that she moved.

Not much. Just shifted in bed. Rolled slightly. Her breathing deepened. That‚Äôs when I noticed something strange - the audio feed picked up sound from her room, but it was... too clean. No background noise. No rustle of sheets. Just her breathing.

Then she said something. A whisper.

I hit replay.

She‚Äôd said a name.

My name.

My full name.

No one else at SomnoTech knew it. I‚Äôd used an alias on the application, something I did out of habit after a few years of gig jobs. But what she said - what she mouthed - was my real name.

The one I haven‚Äôt used since I left home.

I showed the recording to Dr. Ellis.

He watched it, twice, without expression.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely a coincidence,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe dreaming brain replays fragments of memory. She may have seen you on the way in.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been asleep for six weeks.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs responding. That‚Äôs good. Keep documenting.‚Äù

He walked out before I could ask anything else.

The next few nights, I tried to convince myself it was nothing. I told myself it was a coincidence. That it didn‚Äôt mean anything. But she kept saying it.

Night after night. Just my name. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow. No sound - just the shape of it, over and over. Her mouth moving in that same rhythm. I stopped drinking the coffee. Started staying stone-cold sober for every shift.

On the 23rd day, everything changed.

At exactly 3:07 a.m., Marla sat up in bed. Her eyes were still closed. She turned her head, slowly, toward the camera in the top corner of the ceiling. And then, without hesitation, she pointed at it. At me.

I didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt breathe. Just stared as she pointed, waited five long seconds, then laid back down.¬†

I radioed it in.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs dreaming about you,‚Äù the tech on call said. ‚ÄúThat means it‚Äôs working.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs working?‚Äù

No response.

When I arrived the next night, I was given a new form to sign. It was labeled ‚Äò**Phase Two Observation Protocol**.‚Äô

Most of it was boilerplate NDA language, but two lines stuck out:

*Observer must not leave the premises until Phase Two is complete.*

*Observer must report all subjective experiences, including dreams, during or between shifts.*

They were asking me to log my own sleep. When I pointed out that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be sleeping on shift, the night tech said,

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand soon.‚Äù

Marla began crying on Day 31. At first, it was soft. Then sobs - raw, broken, painful. Her vitals didn‚Äôt spike. Brain activity remained stable. But the sound of her grief came through the speaker like it was close. Not recorded. Not filtered. Like she was in the room with me.

I started sleeping in two-hour blocks. I couldn‚Äôt stay awake anymore. My body was shutting down.¬†

And then the dreams came.

First night: I‚Äôm standing in the hallway of the lab. Only it‚Äôs longer. The walls are too narrow, the ceiling too low. At the end of the hallway, there‚Äôs a door. Behind it, whispering.

Second night: Marla is sitting in the chair I use. Writing something. Every time I try to speak, she looks up and smiles. Her eyes are still closed.

Third night: I‚Äôm in the observation room, but the monitors show me, sleeping. Marla‚Äôs bed is empty.

I started documenting the dreams. Every detail. I showed them to Dr. Ellis. He didn‚Äôt even blink.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre syncing,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSyncing with what?‚Äù

He just said, ‚ÄúThe bridge needs a guide.‚Äù

I stopped asking questions. I stopped pushing. I didn‚Äôt have much choice.

I started working double shifts. Eighteen hours on, six off. I slept at the facility. They put me in a bunkroom in a hallway I‚Äôd never seen. I thought it was just exhaustion, but when I tried to leave the building after that shift, my badge was deactivated. The front doors stayed locked. I went back to the observation room.

Marla was sitting up in bed, hands on her face, still crying. She‚Äôd been crying for nine days straight.

I didn‚Äôt eat. Didn‚Äôt sleep. I started taking the pills they left by the coffee machine. They didn‚Äôt help. My vision blurred. My hands shook. Every time I looked in the mirror, I saw bags under my eyes, my face pale and gaunt.

I wasn‚Äôt there anymore. I was just in the room. Staring. Always staring.

And then Marla opened her eyes. Just for a moment, just a fraction of an inch, but they were open. Not white, not rolled back. She was looking at me. Her pupils were there. Focused. She held my gaze for a breath, then closed them.

I tried to call Dr. Ellis. My radio didn‚Äôt work anymore. The lights went out. The only thing left was the audio feed. Her soft crying. And then, she said my name again.

That‚Äôs when I noticed.

My clipboard was empty. Every log, every note, every dream I‚Äôd written down - gone. I grabbed for the stack of old forms from the drawer under the monitor. They weren‚Äôt there. Not even the signature pages. Just hundreds of blank sheets.

I looked up at the monitors. The leftmost screen was blank. I hadn‚Äôt noticed it. Was it always like that? It was dark. No vitals. No video. Just a black screen with a single white label - my name.

Marla pointed at it. The crying stopped.

She stood up and walked to the window. I felt cold. My blood slowed. My heart pounded in my ears. Then she reached out and touched the glass. And for the first time, the audio picked up more than her breath. It picked up mine.

I backed away. But there was nowhere to go. The door was locked. Marla stared at me through the window, and her expression changed. Her brow furrowed. Her mouth opened. I watched the shape of a question form on her lips.

Suddenly, I was in the room. Not the observation room. Her room.

My hand touched the bed. Cold sheets. The air smelled sterile. There was one window. No monitors. I was on the other side of the glass. I was in the bed.

I looked over the edge of the mattress and saw myself. I was sitting in the observation chair. Writing on a clipboard. My eyes were open but blank. The rightmost monitor showed vitals, but they weren‚Äôt Marla‚Äôs. They were mine. My breathing, my heart rate.

And on the leftmost monitor, just darkness. 

Marla stood in front of the window in the observation room and pointed at me. She mouthed something over and over again. Not my name. Not this time. I couldn‚Äôt understand it. I tried to get up. To reach for her. But I couldn‚Äôt move.

She took one step back and turned toward the door. I heard it open. Someone walked in, someone I couldn‚Äôt see. Marla said something else and then walked out. The audio feed stayed active. I heard footsteps. A new set of footsteps, heavier, slower, dragging. And then a new voice. It wasn‚Äôt Marla‚Äôs. It was mine. 

I tried to scream. The audio feed went dead.

The next time I woke up, the observation room was dark. The silence was too deep. It felt like the building had been abandoned for years.

I pulled the blanket off me. My legs were weak. My mouth tasted of copper. I stood up, slowly. The air was freezing. My breath came out in clouds. The window was dark. All the lights were off.

But when I looked at the ground, I saw I wasn‚Äôt standing on the floor. I was standing on glass.¬†

And on the other side - a new girl in the chair.¬†

Only, she wasn‚Äôt looking up at me.

She was looking *at* me - straight on - as if her world tilted at a different angle. As if she were seated upright in a room that existed sideways beneath mine. Her gaze didn‚Äôt drift. Her neck didn‚Äôt crane. She met my eyes like we were sitting across from each other, not separated by gravity and glass.¬†

I dropped to my knees, pressing my hands to the pane.¬†

She watched me. Pale, shaking, eyes wide with fear. She looked like she‚Äôd been crying. Like she‚Äôd seen something she didn‚Äôt understand.

I recognized myself in her face, but it wasn‚Äôt me. It couldn‚Äôt be.

Because behind her, on the far side of the darkened room, there was a figure standing in the corner.

It was me. The other me. The one that sat in the chair. Its eyes were open, and it was smiling. And on its lap: an empty clipboard, waiting to be filled. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It‚Äôs been four months since I arrived at SomnoTech. I haven‚Äôt slept in three. I‚Äôve written all of this down. I‚Äôm not sure how many times. I don‚Äôt know how much is real.

The girl in the chair doesn‚Äôt look at me anymore. She stopped crying. She stopped moving. She‚Äôs becoming like the other one. The smiling one. The one in the dark. The one who‚Äôs waiting for its turn.

I don‚Äôt want to know what comes next. I don‚Äôt think anyone does. But it doesn‚Äôt matter what we want. All that matters is what it wants. And it‚Äôs getting closer. I can hear it in the walls. I can feel it in my skin. I can see it in the reflection.

And once that happens, there‚Äôs only one thing left. One final step. One last phase.

This isn‚Äôt a dream. It‚Äôs not even a nightmare.

It‚Äôs the thing waiting *after.*

And we‚Äôre already in it.

We‚Äôre all already asleep.

And we don‚Äôt even know it yet.",5,1744148254.0,nosleep,0,0.86,False

I could be wrong but she might be interested, too. She laughs at some of my jokes and the writing/voice messages feel like as if she wouldn't be opposed if I ask her out. It is still a thin line between her just being nice and her being genuinely interested. She also could be open in a friendship or even be in a relationship. I didn't ask because there wasn't an opportunity really but a part of me thinks, she would have told me by now, if she would've a boyfriend.

So we're right now at a point in our messages, where I could ask her out for a coffee. That would also not really indicate what my intentions are but if I ask her out, my fear is that she might reject me and then it will get weird between us in class.

I have little experience with the US medical and legal system as I didn't grow up here. I want to understand if this is a case I can pursue and sue the hospital/doctor (?).

I had been having episodes of high blood pressure and chest pain/discomfort. I was traveling to another country and went to ER, they ran an EKG and said it was normal. Told me to go to the cardiologist.

Back to the US I went to see a cardiologist for the first time in my life (40M). I reported my symptoms (visit summary shows: ""high blood pressure, chest pain, abnormal EKG"") and they ran an EKG which the doctor said there was a ""little thing"" but nothing worrisome. She asked me for an echocardiogram and a stress test (one month out).

Fast forwards only 5 days, I start having high blood pressure and chest pain again, this time stronger than ever. I didn't sleep a whole night. I sent the doctor a message about the blood pressure and pain, she told me to do ""some breathing exercises and avoid phone, TV, alchohol, and coffee"".

In the morning I couldn't stand it anymore and went to ER. The EKG was horrible, they rushed me into catheterism, removed a blood clot from one of the main arteries of the heart (AKA the widow maker) and put a stent in it. It was full blockage, a massive heart attack.

If it wasn't for me listening to my body (and not this doctor), I'd be dead now.

**\[Date: 2025-4-8\]**

**\[Time: 23:47 EST\]**

**\[Battery: 6%\]**

My fingers tremble as I type this. Not from fear‚Äîthough God knows there's enough of that‚Äîbut from the laughter. Hysterical, broken laughter that bubbles up whenever I remember how eagerly we reached for their outstretched hands.

Three days ago, they arrived. Not with explosions or ultimatums like our films predicted. Just silence. Presence. Twelve massive vessels materializing simultaneously in Earth's orbit, each positioned above a major population center. Perfect geometric structures of shifting opalescence, like fractals carved from dawn light.

Humanity collectively held its breath.

I was presenting at an astrophysics conference in Geneva when the first vessel appeared overhead. My keynote on ""Communication Protocols for Potential Non-Human Intelligence"" became instantly obsolete as my audience's phones lit up with notifications. We abandoned the auditorium en masse, stumbling outside with everyone else to stare upward. The sky‚Äîthat familiar Swiss blue‚Äînow cradled something impossible. I remember Dr. Kapur gripping my arm so tightly it left bruises, whispering, ""Aris, your models were right. They're here.""

Twenty years of being ridiculed for my ""fringe theories"" about advanced non-carbon lifeforms. Twenty years of grant rejections. And now, vindication‚Äîwatching my life's work hover silently above Lake Geneva.

For six hours and twenty-three minutes, they simply waited. Global militaries scrambled jets that could do nothing but circle the untouchable vessels. Religious leaders proclaimed everything from salvation to damnation. Markets crashed. Social media devolved into noise.

I called my sister in Boston. ""Keep Ella inside,"" I said, though I had no reason to believe my thirteen-year-old niece was in danger. Something primal in me‚Äîthe animal brain beneath the Ph.D.‚Äîwhispered caution.

Then, the Communion began.

Not through broadcasts or speakers. Through our minds. A gentle pressure behind the eyes, like tears that wouldn't fall. Like standing too quickly after lying down‚Äîthat momentary gray narrowing of vision‚Äîbut instead of fading, it intensified into the clearest thought I'd ever experienced:

*We are the Vanguard. We come in peace. We bring evolution.*

The sensation was... intoxicating. Around me, hardened skeptics wept openly. Dr. Jameson‚Äîwho once spent an entire department meeting arguing that the Drake Equation proved we were alone in the universe‚Äîfell to his knees, face transfigured with rapture. A lifetime atheist myself, I felt something uncannily like reverence wash over me, drowning my scientific detachment in a tide of wonder.

The mass panic subsided so quickly it should have been our first warning sign.

When they descended‚Äîbeings of luminous architecture, their forms constantly shifting like liquid crystal‚Äîcrowds gathered without fear. I pushed through the throng in Geneva's Place des Nations, academic caution warring with an inexplicable need to be closer. Their movements defied physics, each step less a contact with earth than a negotiation with gravity itself. They had no discernible faces, just smooth, reflective surfaces that mirrored our own expressions back at us‚Äîalways slightly improved, slightly more serene.

I reached out my hand toward one that glided past. It paused, turned toward me. In its surface, I saw myself‚Äînot as I was, gray-streaked hair disheveled from sleepless nights of research, eyes permanently shadowed from staring at screens‚Äîbut as I could be. Radiant. Fulfilled. Understood.

The miracles began immediately. Atmospheric carbon levels plummeted as their orbital platforms initiated some kind of molecular restructuring. Terminal patients walked from hospitals, cellular degeneration not just halted but reversed. They offered schematics for energy generation that made nuclear fusion look primitive‚Äîunlimited power with zero waste.

My niece, Ella. Stage four leukemia. Three months to live, they'd said. My sister had been planning her funeral instead of her high school graduation. I flew back to Boston that night, arriving just in time to watch Ella walk through one of their ""ascension mists"" in Boston Common. The nebulous vapor glistened like morning dew as it enveloped her thin frame, her bald head. For seventeen seconds‚ÄîI counted‚Äîshe was invisible within that mercurial cloud.

When she emerged, she was running. Actually running, for the first time in eight months. Her hair‚Äîa quarter inch of new growth‚Äîgleamed copper in the sunlight.

The next day, her oncologist could find no trace of cancer. Not remission‚Äîerasure. As if the disease had never existed. My sister pressed her face against my shoulder and sobbed, ""You were right, Aris. The universe is kind after all.""

How do you question salvation when it stands before you, hand outstretched?

Scientific rigor demanded skepticism. But each test we ran confirmed their benevolence. Their technology defied our understanding but produced measurable, positive results. Global conflicts ceased‚Äînot from diplomatic breakthroughs, but from a collective shift in priority. What was border security compared to first contact? What was religious difference compared to cosmic communion?

For seventy-two hours, Earth experienced what could only be described as paradise.

They called it Harmonization. We called it a miracle.

They spoke of a galactic community awaiting us. Of Earth as the newest jewel in an interstellar civilization spanning eleven galaxies. Of evolutionary leaps that would transform humanity into something greater, unbounded by our current limitations. They asked for nothing in return. Nothing except trust.

I documented everything, analyzing their energy signatures, the composition of their vessels, the biochemical changes in ""healed"" humans. The data was revolutionary but consistent. These beings, whatever they were, had mastered manipulation of reality at the quantum level.

And yet...

Small discrepancies began to emerge. Microsecond glitches in the Vanguard's movements when they thought no one was watching. The way household pets refused to enter rooms where they had been. The dreams‚Äîreported with increasing frequency‚Äîof falling upward into geometric patterns that shouldn't exist in three-dimensional space.

During a secure video conference, my colleague Dr. Tanaka in Tokyo shared thermographic imagery showing the Vanguard operated at 12.7 Kelvin‚Äîa temperature that should render molecular movement impossible. ""Perhaps,"" he theorized, his voice hushed despite our encrypted connection, ""they exist partially outside our dimensional constraints. Perhaps what we see is merely the projection‚Äîthe shadow‚Äîof something larger.""

I remember checking my watch. 3:16 PM Eastern Standard Time. I remember asking, ""But what would be the evolutionary advantage of‚Äî""

At precisely 3:17 PM, Dr. Tanaka vanished.

Mid-sentence, he simply ceased to exist. His clothes collapsed onto his empty chair. His coffee mug shattered on the floor. Simultaneously, reports flooded in worldwide. People disappearing from cars, beds, sidewalks. No pattern to age, ethnicity, location, belief system. Just... gone.

2.3 billion people. One-quarter of humanity, evaporated in an instant.

The remaining population descended into hysteria. Looting. Suicides. Mass pilgrimages to the Vanguard vessels. I joined a group of scientists and government officials who sought audience with the beings, demanding answers.

They seemed... different. Their movements more rigid. The surfaces that had reflected our faces now showed distorted versions‚Äîour features elongated, eyes too large, mouths too wide. The thought they projected was clear but cold:

*Separation necessary. Inefficient elements removed. Continuation proceeds.*

That night, I couldn't sleep. Ella slept in my sister's bed, both of them finding comfort in proximity after the day's horror. I stood at my window, watching the empty streets of Brookline. A luminous form glided through the darkness below. One of the Vanguard, moving with that familiar liquid grace.

Except‚Äîit wasn't quite right. Like an actor who had rehearsed a role but couldn't maintain it indefinitely. Its luminous form flickered‚Äîjust for a microsecond. In that instant, I glimpsed something beneath. Something angular. Segmented. Wrong.

The illusion, once cracked, began to shatter entirely.

By dawn, the sky had changed. Not the clean blue they'd restored, but streaked with colors that had no names in human language. Colors that hurt to perceive. The air carried scents that triggered primal fear responses‚Äînot rotting or burning, but something worse. Something that predated our evolutionary capacity to identify threats.

My sister shook me awake, tears streaming down her face. ""Ella's gone,"" she whispered. Not vanished like the others‚Äîworse. She was sitting at the kitchen table, staring at nothing, responding to nothing. Her body present but emptied of whatever made her Ella.

And she wasn't the only one. Reports flooded in of people found catatonic, their eyes fixed on something no one else could see. Some began to change‚Äîsubtle at first, then with increasing speed. Crystalline structures erupting from skin. Additional joints forming in limbs. Eyes developing nictitating membranes.

Their vessels transformed. The opalescent surfaces collapsed like shed skin, revealing architectures that violated Euclidean geometry. Structures that seemed to extend inward, impossibly larger inside than out. Not ships. Anchors. Points where something else could breach our reality.

And the Vanguard themselves... God, the Vanguard. Their beautiful forms stuttered like corrupted data. With each glitch, the truth emerged. Segmented limbs too numerous to count. Mouthparts designed for feeding that could never be mistaken for communication. Eyes‚Äîso many eyes‚Äîarranged in patterns that suggested intelligence far removed from anything human, anything mammalian, anything terrestrial.

The thought they projected changed:

*Preparation complete. Veil thinned. Gateway opened. Consumption begins.*

From the vessel above Washington D.C., something emerged. Not a being. A wound in reality. A vast, reaching darkness composed of angles that shouldn't exist, casting shadows that fell upward. Where it touched the air, matter unraveled. Physics itself surrendered.

I understood then. The Vanguard hadn't come to save us. They'd come to prepare us. To fatten the livestock. To prime our reality for something older than stars.

Those who disappeared‚Äîperhaps they were the lucky ones. Because what followed was worse than extinction. It was transformation.

The ""healing mists"" deployed during the first days? They weren't healing. They were altering. Rewriting human biology to make us compatible with‚Äîdigestible by‚Äîwhatever now entered through the wounds in our sky.

I found Mrs. Chen from apartment 4B sitting in her living room, Bible open to Revelation. Her eyes hollow with vindication as she whispered, ""Not aliens. Never aliens. 'And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.'"" The Rapture, she believed. The worthy taken before tribulation. The rest of us left for what comes after.

But this wasn't divine judgment. This was consumption. Predation on a cosmic scale.

Outside my sister's apartment, I watched a child‚Äîno more than five‚Äîstand transfixed before one of the Vanguard. Its form glitched constantly now, not bothering to maintain the benevolent illusion. The child reached up, curious. Where their hands met, the child's flesh began to ripple, to reconfigure. He didn't scream. He smiled as his body unmade itself, molecule by molecule, into something that no longer belonged to our evolutionary tree.

I ran. Grabbed my research tablet and what food I could carry. Left my sister‚Äîno longer my sister‚Äîstaring at the ceiling, her skin hardening into iridescent plates.

This isn't science anymore. Science requires rules, consistency. What's happening now unmakes rules. Unmakes consistency. Unmakes reality.

I've been moving through Boston's underground for hours. The T tunnels. Maintenance corridors. Places deep enough that perhaps they haven't noticed me yet. My colleagues‚Äîthose I can reach‚Äîreport the same phenomena worldwide. The streets run with substances that aren't blood. Crystalline structures grow from buildings like cancers. The sky... the sky isn't there anymore. Just a vast, watching darkness populated by geometries that drive observers mad.

Our planet was never in danger from climate change or nuclear war. Those were mercies compared to our actual fate. We were an experiment in cultivation. A crop reaching harvest.

My battery is failing. The power grid collapsed hours ago. I can hear them searching. Methodical. Patient. Hungry. Not just the Vanguard now, but what they've made of us. Former humans moving with too many joints, calling out in voices that sound almost like those they once had.

Ella's voice, calling my name from the darkness ahead.

If you're reading this, you have two possibilities: either you were among those taken, spared what came after, or you're in another reality, one still maintaining the illusion of cosmic benevolence. If it's the latter, remember this: salvation never comes easily. Evolution is not painless. And when they descend in light, offering peace...

Run.

Because heaven isn't empty.

I have little experience with the US medical and legal system as I didn't grow up here. I want to understand if this is a case I can pursue and sue the hospital/doctor (?).

I had been having episodes of high blood pressure and chest pain/discomfort. I was traveling to another country and went to ER, they ran an EKG and said it was normal. Told me to go to the cardiologist.

Back to the US I went to see a cardiologist for the first time in my life (40M). I reported my symptoms (visit summary shows: ""high blood pressure, chest pain, abnormal EKG"") and they ran an EKG which the doctor said there was a ""little thing"" but nothing worrisome. She asked me for an echocardiogram and a stress test (one month out).

Fast forwards only 5 days, I start having high blood pressure and chest pain again, this time stronger than ever. I didn't sleep a whole night. I sent the doctor a message about the blood pressure and pain, she told me to do ""some breathing exercises and avoid phone, TV, alchohol, and coffee"".

In the morning I couldn't stand it anymore and went to ER. The EKG was horrible, they rushed me into catheterism, removed a blood clot from one of the main arteries of the heart (AKA the widow maker) and put a stent in it. It was full blockage, a massive heart attack.

If it wasn't for me listening to my body (and not this doctor), I'd be dead now.

Can I do something about it or these cases are usually rejected with the idea that ""health isn't an exact science"" or that ""there were no signs, so we couldn't tell""?",0,1744147687.0,legaladvice,1,0.29,False

1jup244,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1jup244/pem_doesnt_exist_in_my_country_literally/,PEM doesn't exist in my country. Literally.,"I wrote a really long text because I finally had a moment of clear mind with no brain fog. Don't mind the many grammar mistakes!

TL;DR There's a big lack of information about ME/CFS in other countries and languages, which causes less understanding of the illness and how to deal with it for patients and close ones.

To start off, I (f16) have been experiencing PEM-like symptoms for almost 4 years. Though, they were never even close to mild-moderate ME/CFS. It usually manifested at the end of school years after all difficult exams and pressure ended. 

My symptoms at the time were mainly vertigo/dizziness but now I definitely realize I had some fatigue, drowsiness, and unrefreshing sleep. (Was not easy to communicate and understand my symptoms as a 12 y/o üôÉ)

Then, autumn of 2024, a psychiatrist told me she didn't have anything useful but gave me a diagnosis ‚Äì neurasthenia which she clearly said people get, when doctor's don't know what to do...

I started noting down my symptoms as the diagnosis felt off. Fatigue, drowsiness, vertigo, joint pain, low BP, brain fog, not being able to focus, blurry vision, unrefreshing sleep, sensitivity to light, sounds, temperature.

After googling the diagnosis, a lot of articles came up titled ""neurasthenia (chronic fatigue syndrome)"" and others which said that neurasthenia is not a used diagnosis and the alternative ‚Äì CFS.

I started doing research on ME/CFS and obviously mainly in my mother tongue. All the articles and websites seemed like mumbo jumbo. That's when I decided to look into ME/CFS in english and my eyes were opened.

I am now slowly trying to get diagnosed, but as I was searching and formulating my thoughts into words and sentences (when I'm not getting nerfed by brain fog üòµ) and I felt like something was really off. 

In Lithuania, ME/CFS is usually refered as ""tiredness that does not go away with rest"" and the PEM symptoms just ARE the actual symptoms of ME/CFS and upon searching for PEM, there is barely any mention of it (only translations of English pages)

The main issue of this is the future. Let's say I somehow do get diagnosed with ME/CFS. My family members, distand and close, will not understand and be able to help me, because they do not understand English.

All books that are about PEM/PESE/PEME and how to avoid it, help those who experience PEM, such as the ones that are listed here in this Subreddit, are in English. 

When I try to explain to my dear, caring mother or even doctors for that matter, what I am feeling, I am stopped with a language barrier. 

'What do you mean you overwork yourself once and feel sick/bad for weeks?' and 'Just try harder, drink coffee and push yourself' without being able to explain with credible proof that isn't paraphrased by me is tough.

Let's also take another scenario in which a person is rightfully diagnosed with ME/CFS, who doesn't understand English. They're left with their PEM, not knowing what pacing is or how to deal with PEM at all. Not to mention the fact that there is only one credible professional (at least that I know of)

I really hope Lithuania, as well as other countries try to research or obtain other countries research on this chronic illness. I think all people should get the opportunity why they feel brain damaged after running simple errands, despite what languages they know and don't know.",11,1744147558.0,cfs,0,1.0,False

In a bustling caf√© near Quandrix campus, a gnome hastily scribbles runes onto a napkin, while his tiefling study partner rearranges sugar cubes into a proof that nearly solves itself. A group project in Prismari studio erupts into color and chaos as students fuse spellcraft with sculpture, laughter rising over the whirr of elemental paint.

1juow64,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1juow64,Microwave Shelf Beautification,"I have down sized houses and now have no kitchen space. I‚Äôm using what was once my office cubbies to hold pots, pans, mixing bowls, and anything else I can think of.I got these carts for a steal, 15 dollars for both brand new in the box. Taxes included. Couldn‚Äôt pass them up and expected to put them in the garage to get that stuff off the ground ( roaster, bread machine, dehydrator, air fryer, etc.). What I found was that they fit on top of the shelving( thought they wouldn‚Äôt). 

Having them is a blessing since most of that stuff was on top of my counters and we had to prep food on the table. However, they are kinda‚Ä¶ not pretty‚Ä¶

As I said, they were for big appliance items which is why they have so much space. The coffee machine will go on the one above the microwave, along with an electric kettle and toaster, but I need to move the cubbies to get them plugged in. Idea is that tea, coffee, microwave food and toast can be made quickly in the morning along with any snacks.

Other side will contain the kids  tea sets ( yes they asked for them for Christmas), mugs, tea and coffee, and supplies. Along with maybe some microwave and toaster snacks/food. 

Fruits and veggies in the bowls  will remain on the cubby surface.


I‚Äôm thinking of adding some extra shelves to shorten the space  between shelves, especially on the side that has the tea sets and supplies.

My main issue is that it is all square and black with silver screws showing. I will be covering the cubbies with makeshift doors but need suggestions on how to cover all this up. 

Shelves can be covered in contact paper but the bars/legs? I have thought of wrapping in twine or rope‚Ä¶painting would still show the screws they just be a different color. 

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance!

Ps: haven‚Äôt finalized a look for the area because I don‚Äôt know what I can do with these. Feel free to throw out those suggestions. Also, here is a link to the cubby project I am working on. https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8j6mNSQ/

I am also okay with just watching you stream your game while on Discord & we can even chat while playing different games. I very much enjoy chatting/texting frequently about anything under the sun (though forgive me if I take some time to reply, you know, work!) Maybe you had a complaint of how bad your coffee was made or you have many thoughts about a particular subject; either way, I am all ears! I am also LGBTQ+ friendly, so please do not hesitate!

 One thing I do ask of you is if you are someone who needs to be texted first/cannot keep a conversation/do not ask for feedback or do not plan on creating a long term friendship, kindly steer away from this post.

I graduated from university last July and was forced to move back to my small hometown because I ran out of money, which has a terminal case of Hot Fuzz-esque drama with a very densely populated older generation who don't take kindly to people doing cool internet stuff.
I did a degree in media production and had a brief psychosis in my third year, which was arguably caused largely by the people I lived with, and I basically got monetarily supported by my parents throughout the entire year. which has left me with 0 student debt, my ¬£2,000.00 PC, an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, and a dream.

I am a very socially well-adjusted person and post-grad have tried to keep lines of communication with friends from the UK who don't live in such a shithole as I do to keep me sane, however I'm in a bit of a dumpster fire situation with my parents where they are expecting me to be paying rent, releasing creative projects that I work on in my leisure for fun, being their only son (I have a sister who is 3 years younger), while also looking to flee the nest again.
This sounds like a first-world problem but I'm quite a good-looking dude and since starting to hit gym again type thing I've had women trying to get my attention, and it's just such a terrible weird situation I am broke.
I also live right next to a private school, and the job here is largely finance which sucks since my skillset lies within digital media re marketing, PR, video editing, Photoshop. and 'influencing' (I guess you could add on the end). I‚Äôll like post something on social media and then young girls who go to the school will like see it and acknowledge which is really stressful since I also have an encyclopedic knowledge of predatory creators and trying to set anything up in my position is really difficult since I essentially wfh currently. 

During the time I have spent back home I have found it insanely hard to adjust to living with my parents and am determined to find work that isn't food service, and catering considering the fact I did that at uni and I left that job expecting to never have to serve coffees again. I'm trying to establish freelance work on online business, but the hardened case of 'small-town syndrome' that plagues this place is impossible to shake. I haven't dated or anything like that since being back, but just the fact that I am quite a private person and have set my social media up the way I have has made me a target for 'small-community' mob/weird interactions. I kind've realized that older people and particularly middle-aged women will profile you based on other people they recognise from pop-culture who look like you. For instance today we went out for dinner with my grandad for his birthday, and old women across the room started making #metoo jokes (because I look a bit like Kevin Spacey, I'm not sure) and sort've sideying me which really sucked.

I still message friends from uni quite a bit and have dumped quite a bit over messages with them about my situation, and without receiving like a proper 'response' the reception I've gotten back from them is that from an outside perspective I seem quite suffocated. LIke I have loads of stuff on hard drives but again like trying to explain to my mum that I am only 22 and I can't be creating full feature films for her to view after a her 9-5 is really nauseating. The comparison I gave to people I met at uni was that it is a pocket-version of Hot Fuzz which I still stand by, and since being back I've had local police like (not harass me) but like keep an eye on me (parents aren't aware just like I'll go and get takeout and police will haphazardly turn up at the same time and wave their phone at me which is like a go ahead for me to post more random stuff) and its really shite. I worked at a printing place over Christmas and also started getting Luca Magnotta comparisons which is understandbly quite upsetting! Poeple will walk past my house and shout stuff or like attempt to troll the few online accounts I have setup which is really frustrating.
I've spent quite a while 'upskilling creatively' and my parents have also personally told me that I 'changed too much' at university, and so there is a high likelihood I will be living with my gran who lives close to London in a few months which will be complete bliss if it happens, however spending any short amount of time on the internet shows me results that the UK is absolutely awful for finding employment at the moment. My sister and her boyfriend are both incredibly straight-laced people, and he works in finance, so my like outlet has been firing insanely passive-aggressive messages into the internet and reposting the most nihilistic music as a means to show that I am 'working on stuff' to any potential employers. Being the eldest son across my entire family but the youngest dude in my friend group the amount of pressure on me to be like 'on' all the time is unbelievable, and my extended family now also all lurk my social media (down to my spotify playlists) which is a really really freaky and weird to experience, since I feel like I should be independent but am being placed under a microscope by old people who shit themselves after looking at my Twitter reposts. My friends will send me jobs and its just like absolute hell trying to be a person in x many different peoples realities if that makes sense.
By the time a Sunday rolls around the pressure in my ears is splitting, and my mum (who doesn't really know much about internet culture) just thinks I sit around doing nothing all day) and my sister is a nurse, which puts me in a really weird position because like with her being a nurse I feel as if I'm not allowed to be 'flawed' as a person if that makes sense because like her job and 'service' to our towns' society is infinitely more important than mine. My parents do this thing where they are like 'we have always tried to push you and your sister to your fullest potential,' and have started like putting on all sorts of music on to like influence all the stuff I make, and it's just really aggravating feeling like this guinea pig of the family who is repeatedly reminded that they are like the 'future' of our families' existence and isn't allowed to switch off. From someone who spent their three years of university being intentionally mysterious and pretentious, coming back here has been *monumentally boring* on the existence freont, and as someone who's area of interest lies within morally-grey rap/edm collectives I am very much a black sheep back here, and so have spent the time I've been back manufacturing shed-loads of new branding and to attempt freelancing as a business.
Any advice or guidance would be massively appreciated because I feel like a massive idiot being stuck in this situation where I have all the resources in the world and no clue how to effectively use them.

1juoed8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfuckYourHabitat/comments/1juoed8/update_keeping_it_ufd_while_disabled_surgery/,Update: Keeping it UF'd while disabled (surgery edition),"It's been about a month since my last post and probably about 2 months total since I really started trying to unfuck everything in my home. For context, I'm disabled, and I just had surgery 4 days ago. My habitat is still unfucked, and here's how I'm doing it. 

*  Declutter. Declutter. Declutter. 
   * If you can never keep your home clean, you probably have too much stuff. Do you need all those mugs? Do you wear all of your clothes outside of when you have absolutely nothing left? 
   * See if there are donation centers that will pick up your stuff. I used Big Brother Big Sister. (bonus points if you have ADHD and the deadline will give you hyperfocus to get it all done)
* Start small. Build up your habits one day at a time, one object at a time. 
   * I use Finch for this. I have a ""put one thing away that isn't in its place"" goal and a ""nightly reset"" goal that's linked to a timer. 
   * If 10min of cleaning is too much to think about, go smaller. I dropped down to as little as 3min at one point. Now I start at about 5, but post surgery that 3min is probably going to show back up again. 
* Clutterbug. Take the quiz, find out what insect you are, take the recommendations from there. Surprising no one, I'm a butterfly in denial, and realizing that has helped a LOT. 
* Wheels. Can it have wheels? Give it wheels. 
   * Trash can, laundry, recycling, 3 tier carts to pick up all your shit in one go, PUT IT ALL ON WHEELS. 
   * There are adhesive caster wheels on Amazon that you can use to stick wheels on anything. I did this for my giant ass recycling bin. 
   * You may also find folding grocery and utility carts useful. This is how you give packages and anything else in your home that needs wheels, wheels. 
   * The less you have to carry, the better. It's easier to push something on wheels than to carry it from room to room (or out the door). 
* Tiny space? USE THE VERTICAL SPACE. 
   * You have walls and doors. Use them. There's a ton of adhesive options for renters and it's easy enough to learn to use spackle if you want something more stable (it's basically building frosting, you'll be fine for a few spots as long as you don't eat it)
   * Ex: Spice racks on the fridge for all of my spices & cooking oils, hanging ""nursery organizer"" for hats, masks, and other entryway items that are easy to lose, hooks for keys, a broom holder in the kitchen for a broom and a fire blanket
* Did I mention habits? Habits. 
   * Get in the habit of putting stuff away. End of the day, as you use it, doesn't matter. As long as it goes away. 
* If the stuff doesn't stay away, you either have too much stuff or you need different organizing system. 
   * See also: clutterbug. I learned I can't be trusted to just put something away in a detailed manner. I can put it in a basket/bin/shelf in front of my face and deal with taking a few extra seconds later to find it again (my spices on the fridge are a hot mess but they're my hot mess) 
* Run your dishwasher even if it's not all the way full. 
   * You're not wasting water. You're not wasting detergent. You're getting your dishes clean when you need to. I run mine every night, even if it's just my cat's food bowls in them. 
   * Especially now that I've just had surgery, it all goes in the dishwasher. Survival of the fittest applies only to my dishes and clothes, and goddammit I'm going to put them through the ringer if I have to. 
   * if you don't have a dishwasher, there's countertop dishwashers on Amazon for around $300 that do not require a water hookup and drain directly into the sink. They are worth saving up for - it was a life saver when I didn't have a dishwasher in my last place. 
* Other items that help in no particular order
   * 2 laundry bins, 1 for clean and 1 for ""probably passes the smell test"" 
   * 3 tiered cart for grabbing all of my dishes that need to go away at the end of the day
   * grabber, especially post surgery because bending over is super difficult
   * mini trash cans in areas that usually collect small bits of trash. I have one in my living room, on my coffee bar (the trash is 5ft away and I do not care. it gets a mini trash can), and my bedroom. Mine are old tea tins I had around. You can use these, coffee cans, tissue boxes with the top ripped off, literally anything that can hold items can be a small trash can. Just don't use it to store anything else without washing it thoroughly.
   * LESS STUFF. (you thought this was just going to be a list of what you should get right? NOPE. Think about if you actually need the thing or if you're just chasing the dopamine hit by hitting purchase) 
* Ask for help. 
   * Family, friends, the local church, or hired help. There is no shame in asking for help. 
   * My friend that was watching my cat deep cleaned my entire apartment while I was gone for surgery. I nearly cried when I walked in the door and saw everything was cleaned. I didn't ask her to, but now I wish I had months ago. Having a fully reset space makes it much easier to stay motivated to keep your space tidy. 
* Finally, most importantly: be kind to yourself. You're doing the absolute best you can, and that's all anyone can ask of you. If you're overwhelmed,¬†take a step back, consider listening to KC Davis' ""How to Keep House While Drowning"" (I listened to it several times on loop while I started the UF'ing process), and then start small when you're able.

1juoe1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1juoe1n/a_very_long_but_thorough_review_of_ao_resort/,A very long but thorough review of AO Resort Valentin Imperial Riviera Maya,"My husband and I spent our 30th anniversary trip at VIM for 6 days and honestly, every expectation we had was not only met, but far exceeded. This was our first trip to a 5 star Mexican resort, and it was worth every penny that we paid and more. It would be impossible to list everything, but here‚Äôs my shot at a fair and honest review:  
  
\- We stayed in a Golden Superior King, as we were told it was the only way without going up to an Emerald to guarantee a King bed. These are all on the 3rd floor and we could not have been more pleased. We could hear the ocean from our balcony (my tall husband could see a sliver of it through the trees) and had a great view of the Golden Pool. We had a double vanity and the bathroom closed with two set of doors so there was lots of privacy. Housekeeping and turndown service were amazing, and mini-bar requests were accommodated. One thing I appreciated but don‚Äôt see mentioned much was the bidet, which I think are in all rooms at VIM. I have one at home and usually travel with a portable one for any stay longer than overnight. It was excellent to have one included, and if you‚Äôve never used a bidet before, this is your chance. You‚Äôll never go back lol.  
  
\- Weather was great (88F and partly cloudy) but WINDY. 16-18 mph all day every day, making for red flag days with big waves our entire stay. We only felt safe going in up to our waists, but still enjoyed our time at the beach. Tons of shaded chairs available at the beach and good drink service. We had one tiny burst of a sprinkle for maybe a minute. No bugs at all, our bug spray remained sealed the whole trip.  
  
\- We got shaded seating at the Silver Pool easily and just walked over to the Main pool from there. There were even some chairs available at the Main pool, but only in direct sunlight. For the money we spent I was not going to play dumb chair games with people.  
  
\- Drinks were amazing and you could hardly sit still for 5 minutes without staff asking you if you wanted something. We loved the Martini Bar near the lobby for drinks while waiting for dinner or just picking up a quick mimosa or bloody in the morning. We brought a flask and the plaza bartender filled it with cognac for nightcaps back in the room. Don Miguel‚Äôs was so classy and lovely, and the Italian coffee service I got was delightful.  
  
\- The food and meal service were excellent for the most part, and we hit every single restaurant including the buffet and Caf√© Sissal. We are foodies (will easily throw down $250 for a nice dinner out for two) and while not every dish was perfect, the quality and variety was fantastic. There were very few issues where something was not right ‚Äì my first fillet at the French restaurant was wildly overcooked, and a couple of times we got the wrong dish ‚Äì but it was always resolved within minutes. My least favorite experiences were at Mar y Tiera; at lunch my calamari was so tough I could hardly eat it, and at dinner on Saturday the food was good but the staff seemed overwhelmed by larger tables, and our own service suffered quite a bit. Our longest wait for two was 45 minutes for both L‚ÄôAlsace and Mar y Tierra.  
  
\- The shows were a little cheesy but the performers worked their butts off and we particularly enjoyed the Circus night. The Imperial Band was so much fun to dance to, and they engaged with the crowd very well. Musical selections got more lively the further along we got in the week. We never made it to the DJ.  
  
\- Other great experiences of note were the bike tour, tequila tasting, ice cream at Caf√© Sissal and of course the churro cart. And just the grounds in general, they are immaculately kept and there are little speakers along the walkways playing acoustic music. We really liked that almost anywhere you went, there was some kind of music playing. The gift shop had some surprisingly reasonable souvenirs, and I got a really cute pair of rhinestone sandals at the boutique for $60 USD when one of my pairs broke a strap our second night in.",2,1744145872.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

however, ive found it hard to make friends after this sort of ""awakening"". im always very supportive of my female friends and i even hesitate to share my successes because i fear this would happen and dont want to muddle the friendship. but if i do share a success, im suddenly met with very weird behavior.

an example is, one time i posted a creative side project i worked on on instagram stories. genuine comments are like ""so cool!!"" or something like that, a female friend i (was) fairly close to commented ""why do you *need* to work on that?""

another example is i was so excited to make a new friend who was so thoughtful and had treated me to dinner, etc. one time i had posted a project on twitter that went viral and then the ceo of this app we use and had a funny experience with reached out to me to ask if i wanted to do a coffee chat to see if i wanted to join his company. i only shared it with her because of that funny moment we shared using that app, it wasnt to show off. but she said ""oh i wonder what his background is, that app doesnt look that good tbh"". i brushed it off thinking maybe she's looking out for me, but a while later i asked to hang out and instead of saying yes, she just sent me her weekend schedule and didn't even indicate if she was down to hang out ... my other friend had already freed up her cal to hang with me so i told her that, and she's never messaged me since.

ive also found that sometimes (rarely) i will post a nice selfie of myself on ig just because i liked how i looked one day, and ive noticed that some friends very consistently like all my instagram posts except for those selfies. im actually an introvert and doing this is just facing the fear of rejection, its more like practice, so im quite proud of myself to do it. but it makes me quite sad, im not trying to keep score, but i do notice it because i do remember the behavior of people im very close to.

of course i am lucky to know a few who don't exhibit that jealousy. ive found this jealousy tends to happen with women who are of my ethnicity, who want to be creative or are creative types...im just disappointed as i know some people can get jealous, i just didnt realize it would happen this often.",0,1744145589.0,women,0,0.5,False

1juo6xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1juo6xi/semiinexperienced_making_3_pieces_of_custom/,Semi-inexperienced - making 3 pieces of custom furniture,"I have ADHD, so bare with me‚Ä¶ :-P

Designing my own custom made (simple af!!!) woodworking plans to increase storage in my small-ish house. I‚Äôm genuinely excited. This is FUN! I‚Äôve always liked working with my hands and I get to improve my own life while doing it.

I plan on making a ‚Äútable‚Äù that covers our dog crate (that I can later use for storage underneath after our current dogs are gone - unfortunately, we will likely not be getting any more dogs). I was going to make L shaped legs to frame the dog crate - 1x6s for the back and the exterior sides of the front, then 1x2s or 1x3s on the front so the dogs can  access the crate as they please. I‚Äôll likely later add sides of plywood so that the storage is more hidden and interior shelves. The dog crate sits behind the couch, so using the table for storage eventually is fine, plus our house is visually too small for a coffee table with the dog crate. I like the idea of behind the couch storage/table anyway. It won‚Äôt bear much weight other than various knickknacks and occasionally plates of food or big bowls full of snacks. Would plywood be an acceptable top? I planned to have 1x6 (or 1x8?) as a frame for the table top laid flat around the top for table support.

I‚Äôm also making a slimline entryway table, but I‚Äôm making it taller than average. I know they‚Äôre usually about 33‚Äù, or 28-30‚Äù to match the height of other furniture you can see visually. I‚Äôm going to make mine 38‚Äù (maybe?) because space is at a premium in this 1980s house‚Ä¶so using all the vertical space I can is ideal. (We don‚Äôt even have a pantry! We use an IKEA Billy bookcase with doors, though I‚Äôd love to build a better setup eventually.) It‚Äôll be a ‚Äúmudroom‚Äù-in-VERY-limited-space idea with hooks for storing backpacks on the wall when kiddo is older and a shelf that is high enough off the ground to store shoes (and maybe even boots?) underneath but still have extra room above it. Height will depend on being able to hang backpacks on the wall underneath it eventually. Top will be a catch-all but with more organization! lol I plan on 1x4s for the base and 1 shelf with a 1x6 as the top. (I did say it needed to be slimline! lol) I also have baseboards that stick out an inch, hence the 1x6 on top with the 1x4s. I plan to brace it up against the wall by drilling another 1x4 into the wall juuuust below the bottom of the table. Would a 1x6 be better? That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm going to put the hooks for the back packs as well. Can I use L brackets to secure it all? I‚Äôm making it 40‚Äù long. There‚Äôs 45‚Äù between the door when it‚Äôs straight open and the end of the wall that forms the entryway.

Also, I want to do bracket shelving [system?] in the master bathroom. There‚Äôs a place that‚Äôs PERFECT for it! I was thinking of separate shelving brackets for cost purposes but don‚Äôt know if a system would be better? This will be my ‚Äúlinen closet‚Äù. Any suggestions on wood? Shower and toilet are closed off from it by a door but the sink isn‚Äôt super far away. Not much of a splash risk. I‚Äôd like to be able to store heavier things on it.

I already know ‚Äúmeasure twice, cut once‚Äù, studs to anchor things (a bit sturdier than drywall anchors), etc. The basics. I don‚Äôt have a Kreg jig, but a woman can (and I do) dream about having one‚Ä¶one day! I can‚Äôt dovetail, except maybe one big one if I follow directions on a tutorial VERY carefully, so I gotta stay more simplistic in my builds atm. I do know plenty about using things like L brackets, thankfully lol Sanding, staining and sealing is a no brainer for me.

This stuff doesn‚Äôt need to be gorgeous, just functional and preferably not an eyesore. Any tips and tricks from you more experienced wood workers? Preferred wood choices for any of the things? I‚Äôd like it as inexpensive as possible but I‚Äôm willing to splurge on a piece or more, if necessary. Could I nail everything or are certain things better screwed in? (Clearly I‚Äôll be screwing things into the wall.) I‚Äôll be using wood glue like it‚Äôs going out of style, as well. I want these things to last!!! I live in Central Texas if that gives you an idea of what potential outside environment might come in the entryway and affect that entryway table. Ask any questions you like for more specifics - I‚Äôm still in the planning stage. I can post pictures if needed, to give you an idea of the spaces I‚Äôll be working with.",1,1744145372.0,woodworking,1,0.67,False

Am wring for wanting him to quit?,"I reached out to a local couples counselor but haven‚Äôt heard back yet, so I feel like I just need to scream into the void for now. Sorry in advance this is going to be really long so if you don‚Äôt want to read scroll on by. 

So me and my fiance are set to get married May of this year. He is a tattoo artist, and last summer me and him had started discussing that he might not be getting all that he needs from his current shop‚Äî he had more to learn and could do better financially. There was another local shop owner he was friendly with, and we started hanging out with him and his wife. I knew from the first time we hung out that they weren‚Äôt my favorite people in the world, but I didn‚Äôt hate them. I started encouraging him that maybe this could be a good place for him to go, as this shop owner was well traveled and far more experienced than his current shop owner. So we hung out with them a couple of more times, and they actually bring up to us that my fiance would be a good fit. 

We agree and start discussing details etc‚Äî this would mean it‚Äôs just the shop owner and my fiance working in this shop. Well the second my fiance accepts I start feeling this deep sense of regret, after those few times of hanging out I‚Äôd realized I could not stand these people, they‚Äôre both pompous, pretentious, retired west coasters turned MAGA loving assholes, whenever we were with them my fiance would run off with the shop owner and their kids and leave me with the wife, who would immediately start trauma dumping on me and tell me about all the people they used to be friends with but had falling outs with. But I decide to suck it up, because I love my fiance and I truly want him to be the best at his craft as he can possibly be. 

He waited three months to switch shops, so that he didn‚Äôt feel like he was betraying the other shop owner as he had no hard feelings for him, and when he told him he was switching he asked my fiance ‚Äúdo you really think you could spend every day with ‚Äî- and not hate him?‚Äù I‚Äôm really starting to feel not good about the entire situation at this point but still haven‚Äôt said anything. Then, a week before my fiance starts at this new shop, the shop owner informs us he will be taking on his very first apprentice in his 20 years of tattooing. The hottest 19 year old he could possibly find, might I add. I‚Äôm screaming inside but I still don‚Äôt say anything. 

But at this point I‚Äôm seething at even the idea of seeing any of them, I know it‚Äôs irrational, but it truly felt like he did this just to spite me. Well, about two weeks into my fiance working there I have an absolute melt down, I tell him I hate his boss and I hate his coworker (who at this point has started following me on instagram and liking every single one of my stories which made me hate her more), that I‚Äôm very insecure about her and that I don‚Äôt want them being friends, and I know that I can‚Äôt ask him to quit but I also don‚Äôt know what to do. We decide he stays (I also just feel like I should mention he does most of the heavy financial lifting I.e. the bills and rent) but it‚Äôs driving me crazy each day knowing it‚Äôs just him with this heavily opinionated man I can‚Äôt stand, and this woman who is essentially his dream girl (the both lift, paint, draw, tattoo, etc).  

Fast forward a couple of months and we‚Äôre in February of this year, i don‚Äôt know why but I had a gut feeling telling me to see if they‚Äôve been texting. Sure enough, they‚Äôve been sending memes on instagram (both her personal and professional pages), texting, asking each other to bring the other one coffee to work. I feel sick to my stomach, but it‚Äôs not an excessive amount and there‚Äôs no apparent flirting, so I just make a note of it. Then a couple of weeks later he tells me he‚Äôs finished work and will be leaving in a few minutes. That would put him home around 6:00 pm. 

Well 7:30 pm rolls around, I call to see where he is and he says ‚Äúoh the apprentice did her first tattoo tonight so I stayed to watch! She did such an amazing job I can‚Äôt believe how calm she was and how straight her lines were etc etc.‚Äù My heart is pounding out of my chest at this point and I just okay see you soon and hang up. When he gets home I just lost it, he admitted that he had planned on staying to watch her tattoo the entire time, but chose to not tell me because he didn‚Äôt want me to get mad at him, to which I responded so you‚Äôd rather break my trust, lie to me, and prioritize time with over time with me. I tell him I made it clear at the beginning of our relationship I‚Äôm not okay with him making new female friends, and that he seriously needs to learn how to set boundaries, and just because they are coworkers working in close quarters does NOT mean that you need to be friends. 

Anyways we have this huge fight, he asks me to promise we‚Äôll never fight about this again and that he‚Äôll never text her again. Welllllll another two weeks goes by, I have a dream that they‚Äôve been texting so I decide I‚Äôm going to look at his phone again, but kind of brushed it off for a couple of days. Then two nights ago we‚Äôre talking on his phone with his mom about wedding planning, he goes to take our puppy outside and I decide I‚Äôll look then, and sure enough AGAIN he had texted her. I wrap up the convo with his mom and when he comes back in I asked him why the hell had texted her again. And he said it was about something they were discussing at work and he thought nothing of sending it to her. 

We get in a yelling match of me telling him he‚Äôs once again chosen her over me, my feelings, and my boundaries. He tells me how he‚Äôs never been in a relationship where‚Äôs he‚Äôs been told who he can and can‚Äôt talk to, and how it‚Äôs unfair he can‚Äôt be friends with her because he would never sleep with a 19 year old. I tell him lots and lots and lots of men sleep with women 5 years younger than him, and that my ex before him was literally 24 and cheated on me and left me for a 19 year old. Then he says that I make working there miserable for him because he knows I hate his boss and his coworker, and I tell him if he knew how to have professional boundaries it wouldn‚Äôt matter at all if I did or didn‚Äôt like them, that I‚Äôm cordial to them when I see them but trying to force me to spend time with them will only make me dislike them more.


 The fight carried over into the next night, and today is the day after that. He did apologize and tell me he truly won‚Äôt be texting her again. But idk, with the wedding so close I feel like this isn‚Äôt settled yet and I was this figured out before we say I do. This is the only thing we ever truly argue about, sure we have little spats over dishes or laundry or whatever, but nothing else compares to the few fights we‚Äôve had about this. I know that deep down I want him to just quit, I don‚Äôt want to tell him to do, I want him to decide that we are what matters most and this is hurting us so he needs to leave. 

Edit to add- within the first couple of weeks of us being together we had our first fight about boundaries and I tried to end the relationship because I felt they had been broken. He informed me he would no longer be texting other girls, or being overly physically friendly with them anymore as well. He doesn‚Äôt have a history of cheating, though he has admitted he came close to cheating on his girlfriend before me. I just don‚Äôt think he understands the nuances to betrayal, there‚Äôs a sliding scale between nothing happening and being physical outside of the relationship. He insists I‚Äôm insecure and have a hard time trusting because all of my exes have cheated and my father‚Äôs affair nearly destroyed our family when I was a child.

My partner just got back from a bachelorette party of her best friend who is a goth influencer. Let me just say right now, I trust her and know she would never do anything, but she came back and told me about the whole trip and the name of this other girl came up a few times and I clocked it. The only the only 1on1 interaction they had was one of the mornings they both wanted coffee and the other people present that morning were not coffee drinkers so they walked together to grab their coffees and had a conversation. At one point she was showing me the other influencers that were there and the second profile was the multiple mentions girl, who I realize is exactly my gfs type. I don‚Äôt want it to bother me bc I know it‚Äôs totally normal to find other people attractive and even get innocent crushes on them. I‚Äôve experienced attraction to other people while in this relationship, but obviously I know neither me or my gf would ever act on anything. This girl also lives in another state and she *most likely* isnt gay (but she‚Äôs goth so idk arent all goths a little gay lol). So I check out the instagrams of all the influencers that were there and gf had liked a picture or a video of the other people that had been there, and 2 reels of the multiple mentions girl (though both of these posts had been pertaining to the trip). I let it go and reminded myself everything is fine. But now, thanks to instagram showing you what the people you follow like, I see that she‚Äôs liked another one of her reel about the outfit she wore on the trip and suddenly I‚Äôm having a lot of emotions and comparing myself to her. Of which I haven‚Äôt done in SO long I feel crazy!! She‚Äôs smaller then me, and she‚Äôs more alt then me since Ive altered my appearance over the past 2 years in this relationship (a lot softer vibe which my gf encouraged and made me feel more comfortable not wearing heavy makeup). It‚Äôs not the first mini crush my gf has had while we‚Äôre together, but I think a big reason why this one gets me so bad is this heavily mirrors an experience I had with an ex. The ex had met someone on a trip that lived in another state, and kept in contact with them, and then started going out of their way on their cross country drives (drug dealer) to stop in the girls state and spend the night with her. So obviously I know I‚Äôm being triggered, but my therapy appointment isn‚Äôt until Saturday and I need advice on how to manage my anxiety *now*.",14,1744145067.0,ActualLesbiansOver25,8,0.89,False

1junx46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1junx46/atia_for_asking_my_grown_children_to_do_chores/,ATIA for asking my grown children to do chores?,"This is my first time posting in any subreddit, so forgive me if I don't do this correctly. It is also a throw-away account. So that's why I'm fresh and new and sparkly. Anyway, let me get to my question. I, (middle aged) have two kids (20's, m). They both still live at home with me, one is working and the other is finishing up their schooling. Both are legal to drink, legal to drive, legal to do just about anything. Neither pays rent, one pays either a utility bill or an entertainment bill every month to help out. 

The other half of their DNA is no longer in the picture, save for one, maybe two times a month, where they go out for dinner or coffees or so walk around town. Thus, it's just myself and the boys, 24/7. The issue arises from asking them to do simple things like chores. Nothing like cleaning out gutters, or even mowing lawns. Just simple picking up after themselves, and the dishes on a rotating schedule. Maybe help me bring groceries in. And definitely pick up after and take care of their pets.

Whenever asked, both of them roll their eyes, cuss me out, ask why I haven't or can't do the things they're being asked to do, and generally it escalates in to an argument before they do a half-ass job of the chore, and results in them not speaking to me for the rest of the evening. Recently, the arguments have shifted in to them calling me abusive for asking for help around the house. The one who works says they had a long, hard day, and don't see the need to contribute further by wasting their down time on dishes. The other says they have had a long, hard day at school, and doesn't need to sweep the kitchen floor. I really mean it when I say I am not asking them to slave. I just don't want to do the dishes eleven times a day, or sweep six times a day, or be a maid to what amounts to adults. I think this should be a shared common space, since they are living here, and making 98% of the mess that accumulates. Bearing in mind I do the shopping, pay the bills, cook, and do the bulk of the choring - except the catch is, I'm also ill. 

They both know this, they've been to countless doctors appointments, watched me recover from surgeries, and see how badly each day treats me on the pain scales. I'm not going to get better, I'm only stalling the inevitable, though it's uncertain when that inevitable will be. I would like to spend some of that time not picking up after two grown children.

The most recent disagreement came after I had gone to get some new things for the house that needed to be replaced; all that fun stuff you wish you weren't spending money on and instead getting Lego. The box was too heavy for me to carry, so I left it in the car. This was a week ago, now. The box is still in the car. It's not a particularly heavy box - it is just too much for me. They've both been asked, and neither will retrieve it. The last time I asked, I was called an a-hole, told I was abusive, because none of their friends or acquaintances have to do anything around THEIR homes, and I should get the box myself because I am not doing anything else, so why can't I.

Where I might be the a-hole is...I told them that if they didn't have the decency to do one simple thing a day for me to help keep up the house, while living here for basically free, they could both start looking for another place to stay, and that if I was going to be doing all of the things one does when they're an adult and out on their own, alone, I may as well live alone, too. 

My ex had a particularly nasty habit of throwing money at things to make issues go away, but it doesn't work with chores, but I think the established pattern they were taught growing up that I tried to break is unbreakable. Schedules, rotating, begging, pleading, asking, demanding - nothing has ever worked. Am I really abusive for telling 20+ year old's that they have to either shape up or get out of my house, ending their basically free ride?",1,1744144672.0,AITAH,19,0.6,False

Let me just say right now, I trust her and know she would never do anything, but she came back and told me about the whole trip and the name of this other girl came up a few times and I clocked it. The only the only 1on1 interaction they had was one of the mornings they both wanted coffee and the other people present that morning were not coffee drinkers so they walked together to grab their coffees and had a conversation. At one point she was showing me the other influencers that were there and the second profile was the multiple mentions girl, who I realize is exactly my gfs type. I don‚Äôt want it to bother me bc I know it‚Äôs totally normal to find other people attractive and even get innocent crushes on them. I‚Äôve experienced attraction to other people while in this relationship, but obviously I know neither me or my gf would ever act on anything. This girl also lives in another state and she *most likely* isnt gay (but she‚Äôs goth so idk arent all goths a little gay lol). So I check out the instagrams of all the influencers that were there and gf had liked a picture or a video of the other people that had been there, and 2 reels of the multiple mentions girl (though both of these posts had been pertaining to the trip). I let it go and reminded myself everything is fine. But now, thanks to instagram showing you what the people you follow like, I see that she‚Äôs liked another one of her reel about the outfit she wore on the trip and suddenly I‚Äôm having a lot of emotions and comparing myself to her. Of which I haven‚Äôt done in SO long I feel crazy!! She‚Äôs smaller then me, and she‚Äôs more alt then me since Ive altered my appearance over the past 2 years in this relationship (a lot softer vibe which my gf encouraged and made me feel more comfortable not wearing heavy makeup). It‚Äôs not the first mini crush my gf has had while we‚Äôre together, but I think a big reason why this one gets me so bad is this heavily mirrors an experience I had with an ex. The ex had met someone on a trip that lived in another state, and kept in contact with them, and then started going out of their way on their cross country drives (drug dealer) to stop in the girls state and spend the night with her.

My dreams have gotten out of hand.

I‚Äôve always had sleep issues. As a kid, I would sleepwalk nearly every night‚Äî

around the house, rearranging my toys, standing in corners, mumbling nonsense.

Then one night, I woke up outside.

Feet wet. Hands cold. Eyes already open.

I was standing in the middle of a parking lot.

Right outside a Dollar General.

I remembered nothing of the dream I‚Äôd been having, or why I‚Äôd walked three miles to that specific place.

All I know is I was holding a piece of paper.

UNUSUAL NIGHTMARES? STRANGE OCCURRENCES AROUND THE HOUSE?

MADAM ZEPHERINE HAS THE ANSWERS.



That‚Äôs usually where the memory ends.

Where I realize I‚Äôm outside.

That I‚Äôm lost.

That I start to cry.

But my parents insist it never happened.

That I imagined it.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always had such a vivid imagination, you know.‚Äù

I believed them. For a while.

That‚Äôs right around the time the nightmare began‚Äî

the invasive one.

The one that stole years of sleep from me.

I‚Äôll try to re-tell it the best I can.

But some of the details are always a little foggy.



It‚Äôs always dusk.

There‚Äôs always a city skyline.

I‚Äôm always barefoot.

The sky bleeds deep red, the sun oozing over the buildings like syrup over rust.

My feet are sore. My socks are worn out.

I‚Äôm six or seven‚Äîthe same age I was when I woke up outside.

A voice in my head says:

*Nearly there. Just a little further and all will be right as rain.*

I cry. I miss someone.

My mom? My dad? A pet?

It always changes.

Through sobs, I manage to ask:

Why did you take them?

They‚Äôll be there tomorrow. But only if you can be brave.

A metallic sound echoes through the silent evening.

The hiss of a sliding door.

I‚Äôm standing in front of a nondescript, symmetrical Dollar General.

The parking lot is empty.

The lights are off.

But the door opens.

Hot, putrid air spills out, and I cry harder.

*It‚Äôs hungry. You have to feed it. Then it will give them back.*

I walk inside.

The door slams behind me.

Everything goes dark.



Then I wake up.



This is where my troubles began.

It‚Äôs hard to notice at first. But once you do, you can‚Äôt unsee it.

A few months ago, I started writing a daily journal‚Äîjust to organize my thoughts.

Try to feel a little more grounded.

Instead, I captured my descent.

The rituals are real.

The rites must be fulfilled.

Madam Zepherine insisted that I burn all my old journals and forget.

But I choose to remember.

Here is a recounting from the beginning.



‚Äî

It‚Äôs been four months since I moved to the city.

I feel lighter now.

No overbearing parents breathing down my neck about ‚Äúsettling down.‚Äù

No more hour-long drives just to reach a grocery store.

And best of all: no more endless fields of row crops stretching into nothing.



I feel like somebody now. I have my own friends. My own job. My own life.

Still in the honeymoon phase, everything‚Äôs exciting, everything‚Äôs new.

New food, new places, new faces.

The day I left, my parents stood waving from the screen porch, their eyes puffy and red from crying.

It was only an eight-hour drive, but to them, it may as well have been an ocean.

They had always pictured me settling down with a local boy, buying a white-picket house across the street, coming home every Sunday for dinner.

Instead, I left for college, partied too much, and graduated four years later with a degree in marketing.

I did feel bad. That town had been home my whole life.

My family was there. My childhood friends. Everything pointed to staying.

After all, the city‚Äôs dirty. It‚Äôs violent. There‚Äôs traffic.

Everyone said so.

But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I didn‚Äôt belong. That the town was shrinking around me.

It always felt... claustrophobic. Like I was meant for somewhere else.

As I drove down that long, desolate stretch of highway that separated my house from the rest of the world,

I let out a breath I didn‚Äôt know I was holding.

And I felt that weight lift like something had finally released its grip on my chest.

‚Äî

My apartment was small.

Only 900 square feet.

I had no furniture when I left my parents, so I made do with an inflatable mattress and a few empty moving boxes as makeshift nightstands. Very functional.

It felt almost blasphemous moving in. Everything was so pristine, so new, that faint scent of drywall dust and fresh paint. And the view. I‚Äôd never seen so many buildings stacked together like that. The city felt enormous.

So much life.

Every window lit, every light bleeding into the next, creating a strange uniformity to the chaos.

Over the next few months, I slowly filled the space.

The couch I picked out was beige. More of a loveseat, but it would do. I felt bad making the movers haul it up the narrow stairs, but there was no way I was doing it myself.

Next came a small walnut coffee table, circular, with three tapered legs and a shallow groove around the edge. I liked the grain in the wood. It reminded me of a topographic map, the kind they used to have at the county visitor center.

I bought two matching lamps from a secondhand store. One worked, the other only flickered if you turned the bulb just right. I kept it anyway.

The walls were bare for a while until I found three small black-and-white prints at a thrift market, trees reflected in still water, each one labeled in a language I couldn‚Äôt quite place. I liked the symmetry.

They felt calming. Balanced.

I hung them evenly spaced above the couch.

I kept my books on stacked milk crates against the wall.

Half architecture textbooks, half novels I hadn‚Äôt opened since college.

One of them, I swear, had a dog-eared page I didn‚Äôt remember marking.

A line underlined in pencil:

‚ÄúWe live above what we cannot bear to remember.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time.

The rug was the last thing. Woven, warm.

Burnt orange with a pale cream border, slightly frayed at the corners.

It made the place feel like mine.

‚Äî

Trivia night has to be my favorite day of the week.

Work is fine, but I live for recounting useless facts.

The Green Goose Pub was a few blocks down from my apartment. Usually, I rode with Xavier ‚Äî one of the few people I knew in the city with a car.

Tonight I decided to walk.



The fresh air felt good after being cooped up in the office all week.

My building was in the financial district ‚Äî the only part of the city that completely flatlined after 5 PM.



They‚Äôd thought of everything: a Starbucks on every corner, an overpriced French bistro with an ampersand in its name, and enough banks and fintech shells to make you feel like money could think for itself.

One of them was my beloved employer: Pocket Blade.

An app that helps you navigate the city ‚Äî walking, driving, biking ‚Äî always calculating the most efficient route.

From humble origins (a group of former MIT grads coding in a condemned bowling alley), it had grown into one of the city‚Äôs ‚Äúessential tools.‚Äù That‚Äôs what the ads said, anyway.

Our mission statement was something like ‚ÄúCut through the chaos.‚Äù

I always found that funny, considering how much chaos we contributed to.

Now the office stood like the rest ‚Äî backlit and silent, glowing slightly behind fingerprint-resistant glass.

The sidewalks were empty.

The crosswalks changed on schedule, even with no one there to cross.

Even the pigeons were gone.

My phone vibrated softly in my pocket.¬†

It was Vera.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you? Happy hour‚Äôs ending and everyone‚Äôs already two drinks in.‚Äù

I glanced at my watch. 6:45.

‚ÄúShit. I thought I could walk ‚Äî forgot how far it actually is.‚Äù

I‚Äôd put the bar into my Pocket Blade app. It said forty-five minutes.

Weird. It was usually half that.

I must‚Äôve groaned, because she didn‚Äôt let up.

‚ÄúListen, you need to get here. Xavier just showed up and you‚Äôre the only one who can cancel out his... energy.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow dare you. I‚Äôm the only one allowed to bully him.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my god. Here he is.‚Äù

There was a brief burst of background noise ‚Äî voices, clinking glasses, someone yelling something about team names. Then static as the phone shifted.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this I hear about weird antics?‚Äù Xavier said.

I laughed.

‚ÄúJust glad you're self-aware about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you? Trivia doesn‚Äôt start until the country bumpkin arrives. I thought you were supposed to show us how to make whiskey in a bathtub?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's called moonshine, actually. Respect the craft.‚Äù

‚ÄúCall yourself a rideshare and get over here. You‚Äôre not walking in this city unless you‚Äôre trying to end up in an unsolved Netflix doc.‚Äù

On the other end, I heard a burst of cheering, maybe someone banging on a table.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe ghost of John Lennon just floated in and took three shots!‚Äù

Then he hung up, the silence of the city rushed to fill the life on the other end of the line.¬†

So weird not hearing birds or cicadas every night. Probably the one thing I miss most.

I pulled out my phone and ordered an Uber. Would only be three minutes till he arrived.

¬†‚Äî¬†

A heavy grey blanket rose in the distance, not clouds, not rain, just a thick sludge that blotted out the neutral oranges and blues of the setting sun. The stark contrast snapped me out of my dissociation.



I‚Äôd driven down this road thousands of times, but it felt like I was seeing it for the first time.

I guess riding in an Uber will do that to you.



I started noticing things:

The A/C blowing cold air directly into my eyes.

The dull headache building behind my temples.

The woman driving, her window cracked halfway down, a line of chipped red polish on her nails, a fracture blooming across her windshield like a vein.

Then I saw it.

Just off the road, between three houses and four distinct big red bold letters.

My heart skipped. My eyes widened.

It had been here the whole time.

How had I never seen it before?

Screeching tires.

The driver‚Äôs scream cut through the air.

I looked up just in time to see the windshield explode.

For a second, the air was warm, not the choking heat of panic, but something soft.

I felt my hands resting neatly on my lap.

I exhaled.

Then the glass came.

Fragments and metal screaming in a tangled roar.

My body snapped sideways, shoulder crunching, arm folded beneath me.

Blood spattered across the fabric in sharp, rhythmic bursts.

A starburst of pain as something slammed against my face.

I inhaled sharply.

My vision blurred. My eyelids fluttered.

Darkness pulled at the edges of my sight.

And just before it took me,

I saw a billboard.

STRANGE DREAMS?

COME SEE MADAM ZEPHERINE.

‚Äî

I awoke sometime later, my headache now a relentless pulse, worsened by the sharp tang of stale ammonia and latex.

The air was thick and artificial, like breathing through a plastic bag.

I pushed myself upright in the dense hospital bed. My body ached everywhere, but my arm pulsed with a separate, sharper pain.

The door was slightly ajar. Out in the hallway, wheeled carts creaked past, and somewhere farther down, a cough broke through the low murmur of machines. Monitors beeped out their flat, impersonal rhythms.

I sat there a moment, disoriented, fingers clutching at the blanket. Then I remembered:

Vera. Xavier.

They must be worried sick.

I reached for my phone.

It wasn‚Äôt there.

I shifted my legs over the side of the bed and stood, not easily. My knees buckled, and I caught myself against the IV pole. I clung to it like a lifeline, letting it carry part of my weight.

The hallway lights were painfully bright, humming overhead in sync with the pounding in my skull. I stepped out, wincing, limping. The drugs were wearing off. Everything hurt.

The corridor stretched ahead, still and sterile.

And at the far end, silhouetted against the window, someone stood.

I squinted, taking slow, careful steps forward. My right arm was curled protectively against my chest, the cast too heavy, too tight. As I got closer, the shape resolved ‚Äî a nurse, I thought.

He stood slouched in front of the glass, backlit by the flicker of parking lot lights. His scrubs hung loose on his frame, the top wrinkled and slightly damp at the collar. A ruffled patch of bleached, unkempt hair curled around his ears. His gold earrings caught the light like small coins.

His name tag said: Steven.

He didn‚Äôt seem to notice me until I pressed a hand to the window beside him, my cast thudding softly against the glass.

He turned.

‚ÄúOh my God, you‚Äôre awake!‚Äù he said, startled. His voice was too cheerful. Thin, like someone trying to sound normal in a nightmare.

I didn‚Äôt answer right away. The grey sludge I‚Äôd seen before the crash was gone ‚Äî wiped from the sky like it had never been there.

But the same sense of disconnection lingered.

Like a TV tuned to the wrong channel, faint static humming beneath the clean hospital white.

‚ÄúI think I might be dreaming,‚Äù I murmured.

Steven chuckled awkwardly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get you back, alright?‚Äù

He guided me gently by the elbow, steering me down the hallway and back into my room. I must‚Äôve winced when I sat, because moments later he reappeared with two small pills in a paper cup and a plastic pitcher of water.

‚ÄúSee if these help.‚Äù

I took them without hesitation, swallowing both in a single gulp.

He hovered at the foot of the bed, fidgeting with my IV.

‚ÄúDo you ever get d√©j√† vu?‚Äù I asked, voice low.

It sounded stupid as soon as I said it. But he didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúOnce, when I was eleven,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere was this school trip. I‚Äôd been dreaming for weeks about dinosaur skulls, running through tunnels, hiding from something in the dark. I think I saw the skull in a textbook or something. Didn‚Äôt think anything of it.‚Äù

He paused, one hand resting lightly on the top rail of my bed.

‚ÄúThen I went on the trip. Museum out in Hartford. We were walking through the fossil hall, and‚Ä¶ from the shadows, there it was. The exact skull. Snarling, just like in the dream.‚Äù

I stared at him, unsure if it was the drugs or the concussion keeping me quiet.

‚ÄúI was terrified,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut then something strange happened.‚Äù

I leaned forward.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Yeah?‚Äù

He moved closer, slow, deliberate.

Bent at the waist until his mouth was level with my ear.

‚ÄúIt spoke to me,‚Äù he whispered.

Then, with a deafening crack, his jaw snapped open.



The noise didn‚Äôt sound human. It echoed like breaking bones. His lips peeled back, mouth agape, revealing a second set of teeth curling along the roof of his mouth. Yellow, animal, too many for the size of his skull.

His breath was hot. Close.

‚ÄúMadam Zepherine wishes to speak with you.‚Äù

As he bore down on me, swallowing my entire body in one bite.



I woke in a cold sweat, choking down water in the dark.

My throat burned. My arm throbbed inside its cast.

I clutched the bedsheet with my good hand, eyes darting across the room.



The hospital was gone.



So was Steven.



Who the hell was Madam Zepherine?

I guess riding in an Uber will do that to you.



I started noticing things:

The A/C blowing cold air directly into my eyes.

The dull headache building behind my temples.

The woman driving, her window cracked halfway down, a line of chipped red polish on her nails, a fracture blooming across her windshield like a vein.

Then I saw it.

Just off the road, between three houses and four distinct big red bold letters.

My heart skipped. My eyes widened.

It had been here the whole time.

How had I never seen it before?

Screeching tires.

The driver‚Äôs scream cut through the air.

I looked up just in time to see the windshield explode.

For a second, the air was warm, not the choking heat of panic, but something soft.

I felt my hands resting neatly on my lap.

I exhaled.

Then the glass came.

Fragments and metal screaming in a tangled roar.

My body snapped sideways, shoulder crunching, arm folded beneath me.

Blood spattered across the fabric in sharp, rhythmic bursts.

A starburst of pain as something slammed against my face.

I inhaled sharply.

My vision blurred. My eyelids fluttered.

Darkness pulled at the edges of my sight.

And just before it took me,

I saw a billboard.

STRANGE DREAMS?

COME SEE MADAM ZEPHERINE.

‚Äî

I awoke sometime later, my headache now a relentless pulse, worsened by the sharp tang of stale ammonia and latex.

The air was thick and artificial, like breathing through a plastic bag.

I pushed myself upright in the dense hospital bed. My body ached everywhere, but my arm pulsed with a separate, sharper pain.

The door was slightly ajar. Out in the hallway, wheeled carts creaked past, and somewhere farther down, a cough broke through the low murmur of machines. Monitors beeped out their flat, impersonal rhythms.

I sat there a moment, disoriented, fingers clutching at the blanket. Then I remembered:

Vera. Xavier.

They must be worried sick.

I reached for my phone.

It wasn‚Äôt there.

I shifted my legs over the side of the bed and stood, not easily. My knees buckled, and I caught myself against the IV pole. I clung to it like a lifeline, letting it carry part of my weight.

The hallway lights were painfully bright, humming overhead in sync with the pounding in my skull. I stepped out, wincing, limping. The drugs were wearing off. Everything hurt.

The corridor stretched ahead, still and sterile.

And at the far end, silhouetted against the window, someone stood.

I squinted, taking slow, careful steps forward. My right arm was curled protectively against my chest, the cast too heavy, too tight. As I got closer, the shape resolved ‚Äî a nurse, I thought.

He stood slouched in front of the glass, backlit by the flicker of parking lot lights. His scrubs hung loose on his frame, the top wrinkled and slightly damp at the collar. A ruffled patch of bleached, unkempt hair curled around his ears. His gold earrings caught the light like small coins.

His name tag said: Steven.

He didn‚Äôt seem to notice me until I pressed a hand to the window beside him, my cast thudding softly against the glass.

He turned.

‚ÄúOh my God, you‚Äôre awake!‚Äù he said, startled. His voice was too cheerful. Thin, like someone trying to sound normal in a nightmare.

I didn‚Äôt answer right away. The grey sludge I‚Äôd seen before the crash was gone ‚Äî wiped from the sky like it had never been there.

But the same sense of disconnection lingered.

Like a TV tuned to the wrong channel, faint static humming beneath the clean hospital white.

‚ÄúI think I might be dreaming,‚Äù I murmured.

Steven chuckled awkwardly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get you back, alright?‚Äù

He guided me gently by the elbow, steering me down the hallway and back into my room. I must‚Äôve winced when I sat, because moments later he reappeared with two small pills in a paper cup and a plastic pitcher of water.

‚ÄúSee if these help.‚Äù

I took them without hesitation, swallowing both in a single gulp.

He hovered at the foot of the bed, fidgeting with my IV.

‚ÄúDo you ever get d√©j√† vu?‚Äù I asked, voice low.

It sounded stupid as soon as I said it. But he didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúOnce, when I was eleven,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere was this school trip. I‚Äôd been dreaming for weeks about dinosaur skulls, running through tunnels, hiding from something in the dark. I think I saw the skull in a textbook or something. Didn‚Äôt think anything of it.‚Äù

He paused, one hand resting lightly on the top rail of my bed.

‚ÄúThen I went on the trip. Museum out in Hartford. We were walking through the fossil hall, and‚Ä¶ from the shadows, there it was. The exact skull. Snarling, just like in the dream.‚Äù

I stared at him, unsure if it was the drugs or the concussion keeping me quiet.

‚ÄúI was terrified,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut then something strange happened.‚Äù

I leaned forward.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Yeah?‚Äù

He moved closer, slow, deliberate.

Bent at the waist until his mouth was level with my ear.

‚ÄúIt spoke to me,‚Äù he whispered.

Then, with a deafening crack, his jaw snapped open.



The noise didn‚Äôt sound human. It echoed like breaking bones. His lips peeled back, mouth agape, revealing a second set of teeth curling along the roof of his mouth. Yellow, animal, too many for the size of his skull.

His breath was hot. Close.

‚ÄúMadam Zepherine wishes to speak with you.‚Äù

As he bore down on me, swallowing my entire body in one bite.



I woke in a cold sweat, choking down water in the dark.

My throat burned. My arm throbbed inside its cast.

I clutched the bedsheet with my good hand, eyes darting across the room.



The hospital was gone.



So was Steven.

As she stood waiting at Shibuya Station for the next train, she knew this to be true. Because what awaited her were cubicles boxing in nobodies. White neon tubes in the sky giving light to places the sun outside the glass wall couldn‚Äôt reach. And the clanking of keyboards. She once went to a mixer once(no success), and whenever anyone wanted to ask her what her job was, she quickly changed the subject. She had difficulty explaining it to anyone. It was dull and unimportant. That‚Äôs how she described it the one time she ever did. By the time she had gotten off work and waited to come back home, She had accepted that nothing exciting was ever going to happen. ‚Ä¶And then she heard what sounded like a flesh balloon popping. The sudden reverberation pushed her to the floor. She panicked, not knowing what was going on. She stared at what remained of the man that stood next to her. His head splattered across the floor in front of her. Her eyes twitched, she was shaking slightly , and she was desperately trying to say something, anything. But only hints of her descent into complete paralyzation came out. How could he have died? It couldn‚Äôt have been a gun. No one in Japan owned one of those. Was it some crazed American tourist? Come to think of it, why was she okay? How come the bullet didn‚Äôt hit her? It was like him, and only him was targeted. Who could have done this? And then she felt a hand touch her face. She didn‚Äôt worry about it. Because she didn‚Äôt have time to worry about it. Because the same thing happened to her. Akane Shinomiya was dead.

Akane Shinomiya woke up in a hospital room, clean and sterile, with a headache. A pretty bad one at that. She had no idea where she was. Looking around the room, she noticed her left arm was plugged up to an IV filled with a strange green substance. There was something written on it but it was completely alien to her. It wasn‚Äôt English, that was for sure. It wasn‚Äôt Chinese, she‚Äôd recognize if any of them was kanji. It wasn‚Äôt any language she knew about. In fact, the symbols seemed to be entirely unearthly. And besides the IV, the empty tray next to it, and a chair near her door, the entire room was empty, the black out curtains shutting her off from the outside world. Even with the headache though, she was able to hear some skirmishing outside. As her senses began to clear up, a man in a black suit came through the door.

‚ÄúMs. Shinomiya, Correct?‚Äù The man closed the door behind him and walked to the front of her bed. ‚ÄúYou probably have a lot of questions. Like what‚Äôs with the headache? Well, let me answer that, can I ask you something? ‚Ä¶Do you remember anything?‚Äù The man calmly asked.

‚Äú...yeah I was at the train station waiting to get home and then‚Ä¶‚Äù It came back to her. The sensation of existing and then not. ‚ÄúWas that a dream?‚Äù Akane asked right on the edge of losing it. The man just stood there for a moment.

‚Äú...Miss, at times like this, I think-‚Äù

‚ÄúWas that a dream?‚Äù Akane asked again, sternly this time. The man sighed to himself.

‚ÄúNo it wasn‚Äôt. The man next to you at the station really is dead and so were you a couple hours ago. That‚Äôs where the headache comes from. The pain always remains last. One guy we brought back got third degree burns before he died, so he couldn't feel anything for a bit. It was kinda funny in all honesty-‚Äù

‚ÄúOK, wait a minute, I didn‚Äôt even think about that yet. How am I still alive? What is this?‚Äù Akane pointed to her left arm, where the IV tube was inserted. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù The man glanced at it and then back at her.

‚ÄúAlright, that seems like as good a start as any. My name is Han and that is Lime flavored Kool-Aid.‚Äù Akane briefly looked at the IV bag before staring at Han like a mom when her child blames their imaginary friend for the broken vase. ‚ÄúDirect from the source. He likes to send us variety packs though and our documents showed you like lime, so it seemed appropriate.‚Äù It was Akane‚Äôs turn to sigh now.

‚ÄúWell, no matter how I‚Äôm back. I‚Äôm grateful for you saving me. So when will I be discharged? I do need to go back to work tomorrow. Rent‚Äôs been kicking my ass lately and-‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I was afraid we were going to need to talk about that.‚Äù Han said with a look of unease on his face. He went towards the blinds. ‚ÄúUh, that‚Äôs not going to be possible.‚Äù He pulled the curtains back to reveal a swirling vortex of reds, blues, and greens. ‚ÄúGetting you back home that is.‚Äù Suddenly Akane is back at that station. Overwhelmed by a sense of the unknown. Han closed the curtains again and walked back. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre currently in between one universe and another. As far as everyone back home thinks, you‚Äôre still dead and we need to keep it that way.‚Äù Akane tried to find her composure. She wasn‚Äôt succeeding. ‚ÄúDo you need a minute?‚Äù that calm voice Han put on when he first introduced himself came back. Akane shook her head yes and that was Han‚Äôs signal to leave the room.

Akane wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to deal with this. So she didn‚Äôt. Instead she went back to her childhood. She had a fascination with outer space as a kid, ever since she first watched¬†*Voltron*. From then on, she made it her goal to go find her own planet and discover her own wonders. She giggled to herself.¬†*That‚Äôs one ambitious kid.*¬†Akane looked back at the black out curtains, now knowing what was behind them.¬†*I wonder where she is now?*

Han came back an hour later, a cup of coffee in hand.

‚ÄúJust the way you like it.‚Äù Akane, having calmed down at this point, carefully took the cup and took a gentle sip. She looked down at the cup. He was correct.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù She quietly asked.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù He responded. She gazed back up at Han.

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I go back home? Why does everyone have to assume I‚Äôm dead?‚Äù Han didn‚Äôt have an answer. At least not yet. So he walked to the lonely chair near the door, picked it up, placed it at the front of Akane‚Äôs bed, and sat in it.

‚ÄúI work for an organization called OSA. The Omniversal Survival Agency. It is our job to protect, well, everything. We believe in stability. Hold on.‚Äù Han reached into the inside of his coat and took a folder out and gave it to Akane. She opened it up, only to see a face she had seen on TV a dozen times.

‚ÄúThis is that terrorist right?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYes, Tomura Shigaraki. Of course you know him, he‚Äôs from your world. But he‚Äôs not the one who killed you. The one who killed you is right behind him.‚Äù Akane flipped the document to find someone who she had not seen, even once.¬†

‚ÄúHis name is Mahito and he is not from your world. He plays by entirely different rules. You could still be alive if he wasn‚Äôt there. But because the barrier between universes wasn‚Äôt stable. You and several other innocent civilians died. Same thing happened to me. I was working over in Mongolia for a client, hoping to get back home too, when I was caught in a large explosion. Turned out some bounty hunter pissed off the wrong angel of vengeance. Long story. Point is, when the wrong people are in the wrong universe, a lot of damage can be done. In order to keep your universe stable, we can‚Äôt just let someone who should be dead back in. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù Akane held her right elbow in her left palm as she repeatedly pinched the bridge of her nose with her eyes closed.

‚ÄúAlright, so what am I supposed to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could join us.‚Äù Her eyes were wide open as she froze.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe want you to join OSA.‚Äù Han said with a cheerful grin. Akane let her right hand fall beside her.

‚ÄúWhy would I ever do that? What would you even want from me? I‚Äôm nothing special. I‚Äôm nobody.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly why we want you.‚Äù Akane looked at Han with confusion. ‚ÄúYou know who James Bond is, right? Everyone knows who James Bond is. You couldn‚Äôt possibly have James Bond spying in real life because everyone would recognize him on sight. But no one would ever suspect you because they wouldn‚Äôt even recognize you. You look so unspecial to the point that you are special to us. You are the opposite of suspicious. But¬†**we**¬†know that you are special. I mean, it says right here in your docs that you used to be called ‚ÄúBaddie‚Äù in college. I mean that‚Äôs got to have a story behind that.‚Äù Akane blushed a little at that. ‚ÄúLook, the point is, we know you‚Äôve always had bigger ambitions in life. OSA is an opportunity to reach some of those and even go further beyond. We won‚Äôt just send you into outer space, we‚Äôll send you there so you can save outer space. So what do you say?‚Äù

Akane glanced back at the black out curtains, knowing full well what was behind them. And then she looked back into herself. Back to that kid that laid in the greenest grass and gazed upon the night sky and its infinite infinities. And then back to Han, with that slightly-trying-to-hard smile of his.

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôd definitely beat my old job.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúExcellent!‚Äù Han clapped and jumped out of his seat. ‚ÄúNow I can introduce you to your new partner. He‚Äôs been waiting outside actually. Although, I should warn you, he‚Äôs a little sensitive about the way he died.‚Äù

‚ÄúI did not die!‚Äù Akane and Han looked back to the door, only to find a masked jackal standing upright at the entrance.

‚ÄúWell you would‚Äôve if we hadn‚Äôt rescued you, Infinite. You did have your entire skeleton crushed.‚Äù Han pointed out, although clearly trying to be gentle about it.

‚ÄúAre you calling me weak? Because I‚Äôm not. I am not we-‚Äù

‚ÄúHRRRNGH!‚Äù

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Infinite threw his palm out at what turned out to be one of the younger nurses just passing by, laughing to themselves. He lowered it and looked back at the two, who said nothing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not weak.‚Äù he said under his breath.

*Well, this is certainly much more interesting first day than my last job.*¬†Akane thought to herself.",6,1744144077.0,DeathbattleBaddie,1,0.88,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building your own patio swing can be a rewarding woodworking project that enhances your outdoor space. Before you get started, it's important to think through a few key considerations that will help you design the perfect swing for your needs and style. Understanding these elements will not only make your project easier but will also ensure that your patio swing is comfortable and durable.

### Define the Purpose of Your Swing

Begin by considering how you plan to use your patio swing. Will it be a relaxing spot for reading, a cozy place to enjoy morning coffee, or a fun seating option for entertaining guests? Defining the purpose of your swing will guide many of your other decisions, including size, style, and materials.

### Choose the Right Size

Once you know the purpose of your swing, you need to decide on its size. Here are some points to think about:

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
- **Space:** Measure the area where you plan to hang the swing. Ensure there is enough space for movement and access to the surrounding area.
- **Seating Capacity:** Determine how many people will typically use the swing. Will you want a single-seater for a more intimate space or a double swing for sharing?
- **Height and Length:** Make sure to account for both the height from the ground and the length of the swing. The height should allow for comfortable sitting and dismounting.

### Select Quality Materials

Choosing the right materials is crucial for creating a sturdy and long-lasting patio swing. Popular options include:

- **Cedar:** Naturally resistant to decay and insects, cedar offers great durability and a lovely aroma.
- **Redwood:** Like cedar, redwood is durable and weather-resistant, making it a great choice for outdoor furniture.
- **Pressure-Treated Pine:** This budget-friendly option is treated with chemicals to resist rot. It‚Äôs widely available and can be painted or stained.
- **Composite Materials:** These can mimic the look of wood while providing enhanced longevity and resistance to the elements.

### Design Style and Aesthetics

Your patio swing should complement your home's design and the overall aesthetic of your garden. Some styles to consider include:

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
- **Classic Porch Swing:** Features a simple design, often with slats of wood or a solid bench surface.
- **Rustic Swing:** Incorporates rough-hewn wood or distressed finishes for a vintage or farmhouse feel.
- **Modern Swing:** They usually have clean lines and may use materials like metal or sleek laminated wood.

### Think About Comfort

Your patio swing is a place to relax, so comfort is key. Here are some tips:

- **Seat Depth:** A deeper seat can offer more comfort, especially if you plan to lounge.
- **Padded Cushions:** Consider adding cushions for additional comfort. Choose weather-resistant fabric to ensure longevity.
- **Backrest Angle:** An angled backrest can provide better support and a more cozy position.

### Safety and Stability

Make sure your swing is safe and stable to prevent accidents. Here‚Äôs how:

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
- **Strong Support:** Ensure the beams or ceiling hooks are sturdy enough to hold the weight of the swing and its users.
- **Secure Fastenings:** Use high-quality hardware to securely fasten the swing to its support points.
- **Stable Base:** If you‚Äôre building a stand-alone swing, ensure the base is heavy and wide enough to prevent tipping.

### Finishing Touches

Once your swing is built, adding some finishing touches can enhance its look and functionality:

- **Stain or Paint:** Protect the wood against weather damage by applying a stain or paint. Choose colors that fit with your outdoor theme.
- **Decorative Accents:** Consider adding decorative pillows or a throw blanket for added comfort and visual appeal.
- **Lighting:** Installing string lights around your swing can create a cozy and inviting atmosphere for evening use.

By carefully considering these elements, you can design a patio swing that not only fits your style but will also provide comfort and durability. Whether you choose to follow a detailed plan or let your creativity flow, this woodworking project can transform your outdoor space into a relaxing retreat.

Tips and Techniques for Finishing Your Patio Swing Woodworking Project for Longevity and Style
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a patio swing can be a rewarding woodworking project, but it‚Äôs important to finish it properly. The finish you choose will not only enhance the overall look but also protect your swing from the elements, ensuring its longevity. Here are some essential tips and techniques to consider as you wrap up your patio swing woodworking project.

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
### Choosing the Right Finish

The first step in finishing your patio swing is selecting the appropriate product. Some popular options include:

- **Oil-based finishes:** These penetrate deeply, providing great protection and a rich, warm appearance.
- **Water-based finishes:** Quick-drying and low odor, these finishes are easier to clean up and less harmful to the environment.
- **Varnish:** For a durable and shiny finish, varnish provides excellent protection against UV rays and moisture.
- **Deck stains:** These are specially designed for outdoor use, combining color with waterproofing benefits.

### Preparing the Surface

Please remember that a good finish starts with a well-prepared surface. Here are steps to prepare your patio swing:

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
1. **Sanding:** Start by sanding your swing with medium-grit sandpaper. This removes any rough spots and prepares the wood for the finish.
2. **Cleaning:** After sanding, clean the surface thoroughly to remove dust. A damp cloth or tack cloth works well.
3. **Repairs:** Check for any cracks or damage and fix them. Wood filler can be used for minor imperfections.

### Applying the Finish

Once your swing is ready, it‚Äôs time to apply the finish. Here are some techniques to ensure the best results:

- **Brush or Spray:** You can use a natural bristle brush for oil-based finishes or a synthetic brush for water-based ones. For even coverage, a spray application can be effective, especially for curved surfaces.
- **Thin Coats:** Apply thin, even coats rather than thick ones. This helps prevent runs and drips, ensuring a smoother finish.
- **Drying Time:** Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next one. This not only improves adhesion but also enhances the final appearance.
- **Sand Between Coats:** Lightly sanding between coats with fine-grit sandpaper can give your finish a beautiful, smooth texture.

### Protecting Your Finish

Once your final coat is applied and dried, you can take additional steps to protect your finish. Consider the following:

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
- **Use a Sealer:** A topcoat or sealer can offer extra protection against moisture and UV rays, extending the life of your finish.
- **Location Matters:** If possible, place your swing in a shaded area to reduce sun damage and keep the wood looking fresh.
- **Regular Maintenance:** Keep an eye on the condition of the finish. Reapply as necessary, especially after heavy rain or exposure to harsh sunlight.

### Enhancing Style with Staining

If you're looking to add an extra level of style to your patio swing, consider staining the wood before applying a clear finish. Stains can enhance the natural beauty of the wood and provide color while still allowing the grain to show through. Here are some tips for staining:

- **Test First:** Always test the stain on a small section of wood or scrap piece to ensure you like the color.
- **Application:** Apply stain with a rag or brush, and be sure to wipe off any excess to prevent blotchiness.
- **Choose a Complementary Color:** Select a stain that enhances the overall theme of your outdoor space.

Finishing your patio swing woodworking project is an important step that affects its durability and aesthetics. By choosing the right finish, preparing the surface properly, and taking time to apply it effectively, your patio swing will not only be a beautiful addition to your outdoor space but will also stand the test of time. With a little effort and attention to detail, you can create a masterpiece that you and your family will enjoy for years to come.

### Conclusion

Creating a patio swing woodworking project can be an incredibly rewarding endeavor. By taking the time to carefully design your swing, you can ensure it fits perfectly within your outdoor space. Considerations such as material selection, size, and style play critical roles in crafting a piece that not only complements your patio but also showcases your personal flair.

Once your design is finalized, the finishing touches are essential for both aesthetic appeal and durability. Selecting the right wood sealant or paint not only enhances the beauty of your swing but also protects it from the elements, ensuring it remains a staple of relaxation for years to come. Techniques such as sanding and applying multiple coats can make a world of difference in the final appearance and lifespan of your project.

Remember, the joy of completing your patio swing woodworking project extends beyond the finished product‚Äîit‚Äôs about the memories you‚Äôll create while using it. Picture lazy afternoons spent swinging with loved ones, or quiet mornings enjoying a cup of coffee. Every moment spent on your handmade swing will remind you of the hard work and creativity you poured into it.

1junn1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1junn1q/heart_palpitations_from_pepcid/,Heart palpitations from Pepcid,"Today I am feeling really down. I have been battling chronic gastritis since February of last year. I completely destroyed my stomach with aleve and iron supplements. I‚Äôve been coffee and alcohol free for 11 months and basically eat the same foods daily eggs, cooked vegetables, chamomile tea, minimally seasoned meat oatmeal, dates, sourdough bread. I take probiotics, L glutamine, psyllium husk and 20 mg famotidine. After a looooot of patience I was finally getting to the point of having a few pain free days a week then I noticed I was having heart palpitations too often to be a coincidence and realized it‚Äôs the Pepcid. Since then I have tried to get off of it for a few days but got into a constant flare and decided I‚Äôd do 10 mgs but I‚Äôm still suffering and I‚Äôm feeling so defeated. Anytime I feel like maybe I‚Äôm on the mend something happens and I‚Äôm bad off again and it just gets so depressing. Idk how to get off this Pepcid I was just seeing better days of what life was life before this nightmare. Anyone have any advice? I need a Pepcid alternative! I do everything in my power to be healthy. I am in the gym multiple times a week I‚Äôve come a long way with managing stress of life completely kicked alcohol and coffee take the supplements eat the safe food and I‚Äôm still not over this it‚Äôs crazy. Curious if anyone thought taking 10 mg in the AM and 10 mg in the PM could be useful but keep heart palpitations at bay? ",1,1744143978.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1junkkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1junkkf/the_spookysplorers98_case/,The SpookySplorers98 Case,"My name is Faith Bowman. I am a detective with the Louisiana State Police. At least‚Ä¶ I am right now. Truth be told, once this story is out there, I will probably be fired. The higher-ups will know I was the one who leaked this story, name attached to it or not, but I refuse to stay quiet on this. I saw what happened to those children. People need to know the truth. The parents need to know. Something has to be done.

Four weeks ago, I was placed on a multi-case missing persons investigation in New Orleans. The people missing were three young teenagers: 14-year-old Austin Gill, 14-year-old Cecil York, and 13-year-old Kamran Roth. All three boys were reported missing on the same day by the children‚Äôs parents. A connection was quickly drawn between the three disappearances due to the three boys being close friends for many years and sharing a hobby of making and posting videos on a YouTube channel referred to as ‚ÄúSpookySplorers98‚Äù.

According to the boys‚Äô parents and my personal watching of the channel‚Äôs content, SpookySplorers98 was a channel dedicated to a style of content that has begun trending on the internet over the past few years referred to as ‚Äúanalog horror‚Äù. From my understanding, the content is about telling scary stories through the lens and limitations of older, outdated technology. The parents told me that the boys were very passionate about this hobby, going as far as to purchase an old camcorder, record the videos, and convert the film to digital before editing the video and posting it online in order to capture the most ‚Äúauthentic feel‚Äù.

The boys only had two videos on their channel; one of them was a video of the boys going through the woods looking for Bigfoot, and the other video was of the boys exploring an abandoned barn that the parents informed me was on Austin‚Äôs uncle‚Äôs property. In both videos, Austin and Cecil were present and on camera. As the videos went on and ‚Äúscary‚Äù things happened, it was clear that Kamran was most likely just off-screen, making haunting noises and throwing things around, something that was later confirmed to me by Kamran‚Äôs parents. While the content was not made for people in my demographic, the boys were very talented, and you could see the passion they put into their hobby. When questioned about where the boys might have gone, both the Gills and Yorks did not have an answer, however, the Roth parents believed they might have an idea.

The boys were determined to go record at a documented ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù location. While New Orleans is known for many paranormal and spiritual places, Kamran couldn‚Äôt stop mentioning one specific location: the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. The Lindy Boggs Medical Center is an abandoned hospital on the northern end of the city. He would constantly bring up how they should make a video there and how cool it would be, but his parents understandably refused, pointing out the dangers of the building. While the hospital is very popular with urban explorers, it is also known to be a hot spot for drug deals, homeless, and junkies. The Roths told me that if I should look for the boys, the hospital might be the best place to start.

Soon after this, I had a police unit scouring the hundreds of rooms in search of the missing boys. After a few hours of searching, a police officer brought me a promising sign, a JVC GR-AXM230 camcorder. The battery was dead, but the appearance of the camera perfectly matched the description of the boys‚Äô camera given by the parents. I sent it off to evidence with the orders to have the contents of the camera converted to film so that the content could be reviewed. The rest of the hospital was searched, but no other signs of the boys were found.

By the end of the day, I had a fresh VHS tape sitting on my desk with a label stuck to it containing the case file‚Äôs number. I was instructed to watch the tape, transcribe the details of the footage, and look for anything that might clue us in on what happened to the missing children. I dug the old rolling television with VHS player from the back of a storage closet, sat down with a cup of coffee, and popped the tape into the player. The box television crinkled to life with a static hum before the tape began to play.

The following is a copy of the tape‚Äôs transcription:

\--------------------------------------------------

The footage opens with a close-up of Cecil York‚Äôs face. He is squinting as a light shines in his eyes. The time marked in the corner reads 10:42 p.m. Cecil swats at the camera.

Cecil: ‚ÄúAh! Austin cut it out! You know that flashlight‚Äôs bright!‚Äù

Austin (laughing): ‚ÄúWhat? I just needed to make sure the lighting was good.‚Äù

Austin shakes the light more, causing Cecil to squint harder. The camera then pans around to show the outside of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center.

Austin: ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôll shoot the intro out here and then move inside for the next shot.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when I‚Äôll come in?‚Äù

Austin turns the camera to show Kamran.

Austin: ‚ÄúExactly. Gotta set up the atmosphere first. So, for this first shot, you just sit back and hold still. Don‚Äôt want people pointing out there being three footsteps this time. Cecil, you come over here and walk a little in front of me.‚Äù

Cecil steps into the left frame of the picture.

Austin: ‚ÄúAlright, here we go.‚Äù

The two boys slowly start approaching the building quietly. The camera pans up to reveal a sign that reads ‚ÄúMedical Center‚Äù.

Austin: ‚ÄúSo we are here at the Lindy Boggs Medical Center. This place is known for all sorts of paranormal activity. Me and Cecil are currently working our way inside with the hopes of catching some ghosts on camera. Hopefully, we‚Äôll uncover the secrets of this mysterious place. We‚Äôll catch back up with y‚Äôall once we‚Äôre inside.‚Äù

Austin stops walking.

Austin: ‚ÄúOk, that should be good. Let‚Äôs find a way into the‚Ä¶‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

Camera cuts to black. The time in the corner now reads 10:55 p.m. A crunching sound is heard before a light illuminates a hallway on the inside of the medical center.

Cecil: ‚ÄúWoah! This is so cool!‚Äù

The camera turns to show Austin looking into the medical center through a broken window.

Austin: ‚ÄúOk, once I hop through, we‚Äôll walk down the hall. Then we‚Äôll look around for weird creepy stuff to film.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúGotcha.‚Äù

Austin jumped down into the building from the window. The camera panned, and they slowly made their way down the hallway.

Austin: ‚ÄúAlright. We‚Äôve made it inside the building. As you can see this place is already super creepy. Let‚Äôs look around and see what we can find‚Ä¶ Ok. That‚Äôs good.‚Äù

Camera cuts to the next scene.

Note: Kamran was not present in this scene. Most likely, he waited outside until the shot was finished. Kamran does appear in later shots.

\--------------------------------------------------

The next shot shows the camera shining over an old hospital room. Broken glass and litter cover the floor. The time reads 10:59 p.m.

\--------------------------------------------------

The camera cuts to a close up shot of a small pile of broken glass and used needles. The time reads 11:00 p.m.

Cecil: ‚ÄúGotta watch our step out here.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

The next shot is another hospital room, this time with a destroyed bed frame in the middle of the room. The time reads 11:10 p.m. ¬†Austin‚Äôs voice can be heard behind the camera.

Austin: ‚ÄúGod, this place is freaky.‚Äù

Cecil (somewhere further away): Guys! Come check this out!

\--------------------------------------------------

Image cuts to a new room. Time reads 11:13 p.m. The room is still decrepit and old. However, the trash on the floor had all been pushed to the walls, leaving the middle of the floor relatively clear. There on the floor, a large red pentagram was marked. Due to the low resolution of the camera, it is unclear if the mark is paint, chalk, or some other substance.

Austin: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so cool‚Ä¶ No, I don‚Äôt like that let me try-‚Äù

The camera cuts.

\--------------------------------------------------

Camera reopens over the pentagram. Time reads 11:13 p.m.

Austin: ‚ÄúWoah‚Ä¶ Nice find.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhat do you think it‚Äôs doing here?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúProbably people trying to summon ghosts or something.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù

A sudden crashing sound is heard behind the camera. The camera shakes and turns to face the empty doorway.

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Let‚Äôs go check it out.‚Äù

The camera moves towards the doorway and turns to show Kamran.

Austin: ‚ÄúPerfect! Good job, Kamran. Let‚Äôs look for a nice open spot for the next shot.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

The camera cuts to black. The time reads 11:22 p.m. Inaudible whispers and quiet hushes can be heard.

Austin (whispering): ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear anything.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúHow? It literally sounded like someone threw something down the hall.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúIs there someone else in here? I thought you said our parents were lying about there being a bunch of people in here.‚Äù

Austin (whispering): They are. They only say that stuff about there being like murderers and pedos in here because they think the roof is gonna like collapse one day, and they don‚Äôt want us in here when it does. But that‚Äôs not gonna happen for like a hundred years.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúStick the camera out in the hallway and see if you see anything.‚Äù

The camera moves out to the hallway. Outside streetlights provide minimal visibility at the end of the hall.

Note: While the light visibility and camera quality are incredibly poor. A small amount of movement can be seen at the end of the hall just as the camera is moved out of the room. This is only barely visible on a larger television screen and was most likely not noticed by the boys on the small playback screen of the camcorder.

\--------------------------------------------------

The camera cuts to a shot of the hallway illuminated by a flashlight. The time reads 11:25 p.m. the boys‚Äô footsteps on broken glass can be heard.

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúI think we should go.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúYou were the one that suggested this place. There‚Äôs no one here. Even if there was, there are like three of us. Nobody is gonna mess with us.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúBut what about the noises?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúYou saw the video. There was nothing there. This building‚Äôs old as shit, stuff creaks and fall all the time.‚Äù

Kamran (whispering): ‚ÄúThe camera didn‚Äôt show anything 'cause it‚Äôs dark. If someone was standing there, we wouldn‚Äôt have seen it.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúSo what? You want to go back and not finish the video? We‚Äôre here now already dude. I‚Äôm not going till we finish the video.‚Äù

Cecil (whispering): ‚ÄúOk, look. I say we stay and film, but let‚Äôs work quick and wrap things up. This will already be our best video.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúSure, yeah. That‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

The camera and flashlight turn to illuminate a nearby hospital room with an old destroyed wheelchair inside.

Kamran (whispering and nervous): ‚ÄúYeah, ok. Let‚Äôs just make it quick.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

Video cuts to the camera bobbing quickly down the hallway with Austin to the right of the screen. Time reads 11:30 p.m.

Cecil: ‚ÄúAre you sure it‚Äôs this way?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, right down here.‚Äù

A crash can be heard further down the hallway.

Austin: ‚ÄúThat room! Go!‚Äù

The camera bobs violently before quickly turning into the room. The camera pans over 3 of the four corners of the empty room.

Cecil: ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs the ghost toying with us like this?‚Äù

Brief pause.

Austin: ‚ÄúCool. So, we‚Äôll-‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------

The camera cuts and opens with the camera being propped up against something, along with the light. The room is much more open than the previous rooms in the footage. The rooms seem to be filled with pipes, wires, and toilets. A dark hallway with doors to patient rooms can be seen in the background. The time reads 11:42 p.m. All three boys are seen in the picture.

Austin: ‚ÄúOk so I think this‚Äôll be perfect, but I need to check back at this shot to make sure everything‚Äôs in frame. So, you and I will be talking about what we saw and heard, Kamran will make some noise in that room over there, we‚Äôll go check it out, we step in, I shake the camera, and we scream. That will be the end of the video.‚Äù

Note: While talking, a faint movement can be seen at the edge of the doorway. It is too dark to tell what it could be.

Kamran (visibly nervous): ‚ÄúDo I have to go in there? Can‚Äôt I just throw something into the room?‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúPeople will see the object going into the room. It has to be in a place where they can‚Äôt see.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúI really want to get out of here, Austin.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúOk! Then go in the room and make some noise.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúAustin, chill. It‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúNo! It‚Äôs the last thing, dude. Perfect finale. I don‚Äôt understand the big deal. Like I‚Äôll never ask you to do anything like this again, man. Just one little thing, and then we are out of here.‚Äù

Kamran: ‚ÄúOk, fine. You have like one take though, ok?‚Äù

Austin (putting hands in prayer motion): ‚ÄúThank you! It‚Äôs gonna be great!‚Äù

Austin reaches for the camera before it the image cuts.

\--------------------------------------------------

The camera cuts back to the same position. This time, only Austin and Cecil are present in the frame. The time reads 11:47 p.m.

Austin: ‚ÄúOk. Here we go‚Ä¶ Alright. All in all, I think this was a pretty good search of the facility.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúI agree. Hopefully, the audio turns out good and we‚Äôll be able to hear all the strange noises.‚Äù

Austin: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it will be fine. But I believe we might have uncovered something much more sinister with that pentagram on the ground. Perhaps someone is trying to keep the ghosts locked in here with some horrible spell.‚Äù

Cecil: ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs why the place has never been torn down despite the obvious health risk.‚Äù

Austin (looking agitated): ‚ÄúExactly. And to add to that‚Ä¶ what if‚Ä¶ Ok Kamran! You‚Äôre supposed to be making noise by now! Don‚Äôt give us two long to talk.‚Äù

The two boys stare at the door in silence.

Austin: ‚ÄúLook, I know you said one take, but since you messed this one up, we will do one more.‚Äù

The two boys sit in silence again.

Cecil: ‚ÄúKamran, you aren‚Äôt scaring us.‚Äù

Austin grabs the camera and light and walks across the room to the door.

Austin: ‚ÄúSeriously, dude! You were crying about wanting to leave, and now you are just-‚Äù

The camera enters the room. In the back left corner of the hospital room is the figure of an emaciated man hunched over with his back turned to the camera. What little clothes he is wearing are tattered and in a state of disarray. His skin is incredibly pale, and his head is completely bald. His left hand is held over the mouth of the deceased body of Kamran Roth. The man‚Äôs head is craned over the boy‚Äôs neck, head bobbing in an animalistic chewing motion. The camera begins to shake.

Austin (whispering): ‚ÄúHoly shit. Oh my god. Oh my god.‚Äù

The man slowly turns his head, his ears abnormally large for his head. He has a scrunched small nose, his face covered in wrinkles, and a prominent thick brow ridge. His eyes reflected the light, giving them a glowing yellow appearance. The man slowly stands up and turns to face the two boys. His mouth and chin are covered in blood. It appears he was gnawing at Kamran‚Äôs neck. The man‚Äôs arms and fingers seem abnormally long. His stomach appears bloated. He stands with a hunch. The man appears older, but due to the man‚Äôs abnormal face and shape, I cannot confidently estimate his age.

Note: Despite the thorough investigation of the Lindy Boggs Medical Center, no recent blood of the victims was found.

Cecil (yelling): ‚ÄúRun, Austin! Run!‚Äù

The camera turns and shakes violently as the two boys run down the hallway. The footage is hard to make out due to low resolution and shaking, but you can see the boys twisting and turning down hallways for around three and a half minutes. The camera eventually steadies for a moment as it looks down the hallway with the broken window at the end that the boys used to enter the building.

Cecil: ‚ÄúCome on! Come on! We got to get out of-‚Äù

As Cecil nears the end of the hallway, the man steps out of a hospital room adjacent to Cecil‚Äôs left. The man grabs Cecil by the neck and lifts him into the air with one hand, pinning him against the wall.

Note: After replaying and tracking the route the boys took and cross referencing it with the layout of the building, there is no way in my understanding that the man could have reached that room to ambush the boys before the boys reached the window. It would have required him to either run past the boys without the boys noticing or being picked up on the camera or crawl through the small ventilation shaft faster than two teenage boys could sprint a much shorter distance.

Note: Given this shot is both closer and gives Cecil as a reference point for size. I estimate the man must be at least 6‚Äô2‚Äù. The man appears to have thin white hair on the man‚Äôs arms and back. This further supports the man being older, however, he moves with a speed and strength that does not resemble his age.

Cecil screams as the man holds him. The wrinkled skin on the man‚Äôs head stretches back for his mouth to open wider than what would appear possible. The man bites down on Cecil‚Äôs neck hard enough to cause Cecil‚Äôs neck to begin bleeding profusely. The man‚Äôs mouth appears to make a sucking motion. Austin turns and runs back down the hallway. He runs for about 45 seconds before sharply turning into a dark room. The camera is placed on something before Austin turns his flashlight off. Austin can be heard panting before breaking out into quiet sobs. This goes on for about 2 minutes before Austin suddenly stops. Footsteps can be heard coming down the hallway outside the room.

After a few moments, the sound of footsteps stops close to the camera. The camera picks up what appears to be the sound of sniffing. Austin begins to sob again.

Austin (crying): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry sir‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll leave‚Ä¶ Please‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll leave, and I won‚Äôt tell anyone. I swear‚Ä¶ Please God‚Ä¶‚Äù

The footsteps rush into the room, and the sounds of a struggle can be heard. The camera tips over and falls to the ground, facing the doorway. The silhouette of the man dragging Austin out of the room can be seen. Austin‚Äôs screams and inaudible pleads can be heard moving farther away from the camera for around 3 minutes before abruptly stopping.

The camera remains in the location without incident for the rest of the footage.

\--------------------------------------------------

*End of transcript*

After finishing the tape, I immediately ran to my lieutenant and informed him that this was something he needed to see. I took him to the room and rewound the tape to the moment the gaunt man showed up. My lieutenant watched in both horror and amazement of the brutality of the man the boys captured on tape.

‚ÄúWe need to contact the FBI,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúClearly, we‚Äôre dealing with some kind of serial killer who cannibalizes his victims. But then there‚Äôs the trick with him getting in that room. I don‚Äôt have any idea how he could have made it there in time to ambush them like that. And his mouth‚Ä¶ what the hell was that?‚Äù

My lieutenant stood up and began walking out of the room.

‚ÄúI need you to remain here, detective. I‚Äôm going to make a few phone calls about this matter and then I‚Äôll tell you where we go from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied.

I waited in the room for about 45 minutes before my lieutenant reentered the room, his face pale and eyes worried.

‚ÄúHow many people have seen this video?‚Äù he asked quietly as he took the tape out of the VHS player.

‚ÄúSo far? Just us, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù He said sternly. ‚ÄúListen to me closely, Bowman; For the time being, you are not allowed to talk about this tape or the contents in it to anyone. Understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied quickly

While I found his attitude was odd, it is normal for details on a case to be kept quiet while the case is being investigated or handed off to a larger agency. I filed the transcript away in my desk and was placed on a different New Orleans homicide case the next day. I figured I would soon be given more information about what happened with the case or see on the news that the FBI had found the guy. But as days turned to a week, and a week turned into four, I realized that I might not be receiving the closure I wanted on this case after all.

I came into the office early one morning. I scrolled through the daily emails from the children‚Äôs families asking for updates, wanting to know if we had found any sign of their boys. It hurt me to lie to them. To tell the terrified parents that we were doing everything we could to try and find their boys alive and well, knowing that it would never happen. I mindlessly opened my internet browser and typed in ‚ÄúSpookySplorers98 YouTube‚Äù and pressed enter‚Ä¶ No results found. Confused, I Googled the boys‚Äô names in hopes of finding a news report on them missing‚Ä¶ Nothing. I pulled out my phone and did the same, assuming that there was something wrong with my computer, but I was greeted with the same lack of results. I returned to my work computer and opened up our case file database. My stomach was beginning to tie itself into knots as I typed out the case file number into the search bar and pressed enter‚Ä¶ ‚Äú0 Results Found‚Äù. With the exception of the parents‚Äô emails, it was as though the boys‚Äô case never existed.

I stood up and made my way to my lieutenant‚Äôs office. Something was happening with the boys‚Äô case, and it felt wrong. I needed answers, and he would most likely have some insight into the matter. As I stepped into his office, my lieutenant glanced up from some papers he was reading before continuing the perusal of his paperwork.

‚ÄúDetective Bowman,‚Äù he said calmly, ‚Äúwhat can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI need to talk to you about the missing children‚Äôs case from a few weeks ago.‚Äù

His eyes shot up from his paper, his brow furrowed at me.

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúall mention of the case is gone. Not just from normal search engines, but from our database as well. It‚Äôs like the case didn‚Äôt ever exist.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were told not to talk about this matter.‚Äù he said firmly.

‚ÄúAnd I haven‚Äôt. But this is way bigger than just some missing persons case. Those children are dead, and I have no reassurance that anything is being done about it. Hell, the damn medical center has no additional barricades put up to keep people out. That‚Äôs an active crime scene, and any homeless person or drug addict can just walk in off the street and start tampering with evidence.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt get that reassurance from me, detective.‚Äù He spoke quietly but sharply. ‚ÄúAll I can tell you, and even this is pushing it, is that this case was sent way higher up than either of us expected. They told me that the situation was ‚Äòdelicate‚Äô and that going forward, the case is to be treated as though it didn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

My lieutenant was sweating now, nervous over the whole ordeal.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already asked them, Bowman.‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI asked them if anything would be done, if the families could get some closure. They told me not to worry about what may or may not be done. But they told me that under no circumstances will the family know the details of what happened.‚Äù

I stepped back, taking in what my lieutenant had just said. He hung his head and spoke softly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Bowman. I really am‚Ä¶ I know this is bothering you. God knows it‚Äôs bothering me too. Take the day. Go for a walk. Clear your head about.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I whispered softly.

I turned and slowly walked to the door.

‚ÄúDetective,‚Äù my lieutenant spoke, ‚Äúyou did nothing wrong. These things happen sometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù I replied.

I walked to my desk somberly. I slowly put small items into my purse, being sure to be inconspicuous as I took out the tape‚Äôs transcript from my desk and slipped the papers into my bag. After it was secured, I walked out of the building and went for a walk.

I don‚Äôt know what the importance is of the thing that killed those boys, but I refuse to live life on the idea that *maybe* someone else will do something about it. I refuse to let those parents go on for the rest of their lives wondering what happened to their children. I don‚Äôt know who said what to my lieutenant that made him so scared as to overlook the butchering of three children, but whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt said to me.",0,1744143804.0,deepnightsociety,0,0.5,False
1junjkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1junjkl/koufman_inductiondetox_diet_phase/,Koufman induction/detox diet phase,"Hello!

For those who have had success with the koufman diet in the most restrictive phase, what did you follow to make your decisions? 

there is a facebook group that adds some ingredients that aren't on her list to the allowed ingredients, but also says the recipes in the original book are unhealthy and shouldn't be used and that bread type products must be without any additives and whole grain, etc....

Because she has had several books, many blog posts etc... it seems like there are many versions of the detox diet. This is what I've currently come up with, do you think this is a good list to follow for the detox diet, or are there missing restrictions? I want to have as much flexibility as possible since I've started this diet and I expect I might need to be on it for significantly longer than 2 weeks to see any improvement

  
Thank you!

My boyfriend and I are traveling to Japan for the first time this September. We fly into Tokyo and out of Osaka. We enjoy active vacations and we like a fast-paced travel style, having previously explored Thailand, Malaysia, South Africa, Cuba, and Costa Rica also relatively fast-paced. While most itineraries focus on Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Nagoya, we often prefer smaller towns (with an authentic feel), but because the trip is rather short we only included Kanazawa and Takayama. We are using Nagoya primarily as a connection point rather than a destination, allowing us to spend more time in places that interest us more.

We would really appreciate some feedback on whether we have missed any must-sees, suggestions for alternative towns that might better suit our preferences, and any general tips to improve our plan.¬†

As you may notice in the itinerary, we really like coffee so we have written down several caf√©s along our route, though these are flexible options. This way, we will have an option but if we come across something else once we are there that is also fine (if you have any caf√© suggestions, please also let us know!). When it comes to dining, we prefer authentic experiences over tourist traps and do not want to wait in line for more than an hour (preferably way less), so we appreciate recommendations for genuine local spots that fit our itinerary, but otherwise we are just going to pick something along the route once we are there.

So if you have any suggestions, please let us know!

we roved in teams of 1 and we didnt have specific patrol paths instead they made sure we were moving by checking our keycard activity (we were supposed to badge in at every door we passed).

we had a ""control room"" that had every single camera feed acoss all the buildings and in my time there i memorized where all of the cameras were and also where all of the camera blind spots were.

there were a few areas where if you sat at the far side of a round table or at the end of the hall you would be completely out of sight of the camera.  certain rooms also didnt have cameras at all.

you were not supposed to be on your phone or sitting down on the job.  so i would find the camera blind spots and i would do exactly that.  id set a timer for 20 or 30 minutes and take a nap or dick around on my phone.  then id get up and tap my card on the way to the next blind spot and immediately do it again.

most of the employee break rooms didnt have cameras.  we were contract workers and were not supposed to be in the break rooms or touch anything in there.  but at night all the time i would go in there to steal coffee and other things since there werent any employees around.

many of my shifts were 12+ hours and i never had anybody notice this behavior or bring it up to me.  sometimes id even oversleep and be in the same spot for 40+ minutes.  i dont work security anymore.",20,1744143552.0,confession,5,0.93,False

1june6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Non_Medical_ADHD/comments/1june6a/memory_management_techniques_for_communicating/,memory management - techniques for communicating with my future self,"i've been wanting to write this post for some time but keep forgetting, haha.

seriously, though, i have a few metaphors for how i envision the process of storing and recalling information.

one such metaphor is that of a project manager, where the project team consists of me, myself and I communicating with each other through time.

another is that of a conductor, especially vis a vis exercising the 'art' of selecting, among all the tools and techniques available to me, the most practical/efficacious for the need at hand.

the last one i'll mention in this post is that of a 'chief of staff', especially vis a vis *controlling access to* my future self or, strictly speaking, my future self's consciousness.

this last metaphor isn't unlike how evolutionary psychology believes 'mental subsystems' *present* thoughts to our consciousness, a la 'thoughts thinking themselves'.

all three of the metaphors above and techniques below can be thought of as 'presenting information' to our future selves or future consciousness, but i digress...

**alarms** \- as they are the 'nuclear option' of information delivery, i use alarms only as a last resort. the only repeating alarm i have is to remind me to brush my teeth, for which no other method seems to work. other than that, i use 'PRN' (as needed) alarms for things like 'check laundry' because neither my washer not my dryer has an end-of-cycle buzzer.

*fun fact: you can transform any alarm into a 'digital sticky' by simply calling out 'hey, siri', which will silence the alarm but keep it displayed on your phone. this is super handy when, for example, you don't need to act on something immediately and you don't want to snooze it; but would rather just be reminded of it the next time you see or pick up your phone.*

**monthly planner** \- anything and everything for the future goes into my monthly planner. each morning, while my coffee is brewing, i write anything in my monthly planner for today onto my whiteboard.

**whiteboard** \- only actionable things are displayed on my whiteboard. everything else is in my monthly planner (future).

**cues** \- one of these days i'm going to have to inventory the many ways i use cues. it's a skill like anything else with endless applications.

just yesterday, right before i started to record some audio on my computer, i had to pee. knowing there was a good chance i'd forget about making the recording when i made it back to the computer (1) because the idea of making the recording was spontaneous and (2) because who knows when/if i'd even go right back to the computer or get distracted with something else.

...so i (completely automatically without thinking at all) just placed my headset/microphone on top of my keyboard which would remind me whenever i returned to my desk.

**breadcrumbs** \- anything that helps you remember where you left off with anything can be considered a 'breadcrumb'. in the above example, the headphones are both a 'cue' and a 'breadcrumb'.

breadcrumbs can be digital, too, e.g. simply leaving an application open on your PC to remind you that that was the last thing you were working on.

they can also be elaborate, e.g. in the form of an outline where you can keep track of the origins of all the rabbit holes you go down while programming or include text (like a todo list or point you want to remember to make) below your current cursor location so you will 'run into it'.

**shopping list** \- generally, i add items to my shopping list (whiteboard on side of my fridge) anytime i open a container of something and i have only enough additional containers to last me two shopping trips (more if an item is not reliably stocked in the grocery. bananas and chicken never need to be on the list because they are the most perishable of my staples and therefore are the drivers of my grocery trips. on the way out the door to the grocery, i snap a photo of it. 

*side note: i also have a nifty method of numbering items on my shopping list according to where they are in the store where any given number rarely exceeds four items, which i can easily hold in my head so i don't have to reference the list frequently.*

last, but not least, my favorite is **eliminating the need to remember altogether** via routine, simplification/elimination of unnecessary things, brain re-wiring / habit formation, systems design for self-regulation (e.g. search this sub for 'UHT milk'), fixed 'charge-to-discharge ratio' schedule with two-hour productivity periods divided by mealtimes, etc.",1,1744143360.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False
