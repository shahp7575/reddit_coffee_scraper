I can't blame or delay chores, actions, thoughts or feelings by saying and believing 'oh its because I have not had my 1st cup of choice of caffeine yet' or the whole phenomenon of 'having a bad day/got some bad news? Let's make you a cup of tea' that is even used in therapy as a 'healthy' self soothing technique.

Anyone else noticeably feel either more angry and therefore more reliant on their first cup of caffeine in the morning?

I hate that feeling/excuse/reason/dependency.

It's why I didn't want mental health medication.

And is the same thing sober people laugh at and tell people to 'just'get over it' who have drug or alcohol addictions.

And hate how caffeine, especially coffee has turned into a 'wine o clock, don't speak to me until I had my coffee' consumeristic/therefore it's okay joke.

Caffeine is justified when it's turned into a joke.

Just like they did or do with the 'wine o clock' mums.

Anyway, I am down to 2 or 3 half of a big cup, without sugar, from 4 vanilla lattes a day. 

Hoping to go down to 1 smaller cup in the morning and then the occassional 'its cold when I am out about vanilla latte in winter, this winter.

Rather than it becomes a enjoyable activity rather than a dependency. 

Then quit it at home in warmer months of April to September completely next year.

It's been a very slow process, but one thing that helped was getting rid of the sugar, the syrups, the kettle and at one point, even the cute and fancy mugs with the handles and justifying at least the switch to lattes to tea bags as cheaper.",1,1755850071.0,CaffeineFreeLife,0,1.0,False

Anyone knows how to get the free link for this story?,"I died on my 62nd birthday, forgotten in an empty house, consumed by flames. When I opened my eyes, I had somehow returned to six years ago—back when I still loved Alpha Nicholas with all my heart.  
As Luna of the Blackstone pack, I thought I had everything: a handsome, powerful Alpha husband, two adorable pups, and an enviable position. But Nicholas's heart belonged only to his first love, Megan Silvermoon, and my children preferred calling her ""Mom."" I was like a ghost in my own home, walking on eggshells just to survive.  
Everything changed when Megan returned to the pack. She poisoned the pups with moonlight grass and framed me for it. When I was pushed off a cliff, Nicholas didn't hesitate to save her instead of me. In the end, even my own flesh and blood pushed me down the stairs, their eyes gleaming with malicious satisfaction. That's when I finally understood—I was worth less than a pet in this family.  
In this life, I refused to beg for love anymore. I left Blackstone territory and opened an herb shop in Moonlight Ridge, where I met the gentle Dr. Gabriel and little Star, who had lost her parents.   
After I left, Nicholas came looking for me with the two pups, falling to his knees and begging through tears for me to come back.

# Chapter 1

After being reborn, Luna June Blackwood found herself back at 27, with a son and daughter in tow, mated to Alpha Nicholas Blackstone--the most powerful werewolf in North America. He ruled the largest pack territory from the Rockies to the Great Lakes, had been featured on the cover of Supernatural Weekly as ""Alpha of the Century,"" and even the European Royal Packs had tried to arrange marriages with their daughters.  
Everyone said she'd hit the jackpot, but the first thing June did was grab the mate dissolution papers and head straight to his first love.  
She slid the documents across the table to Megan Silvermoon and said calmly, ""I want out of this bond. Nicholas is all yours, and you can have the pups too.""  
Megan stared at her in shock, hardly believing that the woman who'd been Luna of the Blackstone Pack for six years was just handing over the title like that.  
June added coolly, ""Since they all prefer you anyway, I'll make it easy. Just get Nicholas to sign, and once the pack elders approve it, I'm gone.""  
This time, she refused to repeat the same mistakes, to keep playing the ignored mate any longer.  
Megan's fingers traced the rim of her coffee cup, her perfectly manicured nails clicking against the ceramic. ""June Blackwood, what kind of game are you playing?""  
June watched the uncertainty flicker across Megan's face and said steadily, ""I'm not playing games. I'm just done.""  
""June, do you have any idea how many she-wolves would kill to be mated to Nicholas Blackstone?""  
""I know,"" June said, meeting her eyes directly. ""That's why I'm giving it to you.""  
A crack finally showed in Megan's composure.  
She stared at the papers for a long moment before scooping them up. ""Fine, if you're being this generous, I won't hold back.""  
""But remember,"" she added, her voice dropping to almost a growl, ""once I claim something, I never let it go.""  
""Don't worry,"" June replied with a bitter smile. ""I won't regret it. After all, I've already lived through a lifetime of being second choice once before.""  
Megan stood and moved to another table in the Starbucks, then pulled out her iPhone with a graceful swipe.  
When the call connected, her voice turned honey-sweet: ""Nick, I'm at the Starbucks on Fifth Street. Could you come get me?""  
June sat in the corner, a bitter taste filling her mouth.  
In the past, whenever she'd called Nicholas, nine times out of ten, his beta answered instead.  
And yet here he was, walking through the door in less than twenty minutes--the man who was always ""handling pack business."" Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, June watched him stride in, his powerful frame moving with predatory grace, his designer jacket doing nothing to hide the raw strength underneath.  
Their six-year-old son, Kai Blackstone, and four-year-old daughter, Cora Blackstone, spotted Megan and ran over, throwing their arms around her.  
""Aunt Megan!"" Cora squealed, rubbing her cheek against Megan's like a happy puppy.  
Nicholas set a bakery box on the table, his large hands sliding it toward her. ""Your favorite--red velvet cupcakes, low sugar, just how you like them.""  
Megan's eyes lit up. ""You always remember the little things.""  
June sat there watching, her nails digging crescents into her palms.  
After six years of being his mate, Nicholas had never bothered to learn what she liked. In her previous life, when she'd been sick and craving chocolate chip cookies, he'd sent his assistant to grab whatever was available, and it ended up being oatmeal raisin--the one flavor that made her gag.  
""What sounds good for dinner?"" Nicholas asked, his voice that low rumble that used to make her knees weak. ""Italian or sushi?""  
Megan smiled and pulled the dissolution papers from her purse. ""Before we decide that, there's something I need you to look at.""  
She flipped to the signature page. ""I've been eyeing this penthouse in Manhattan, but I'm a little short on the down payment right now. Could you--""  
Nicholas took the pen and signed without even reading what it said. ""Between us, why make it complicated?""  
""Aunt Megan's getting a new place?"" Kai asked, looking up with bright eyes. ""Dad, you should get the one next door! Cora and I want to live with her--we're tired of being stuck with Mom all the time.""  
Nicholas's jaw tightened, but seeing the kids' hopeful faces, he nodded. ""Alright, we'll look into it.""  
""No need to go to all that trouble,"" Megan said quickly. ""I'll make sure there are three bedrooms--for Kai, Cora, and you. You can stay over whenever you want.""  
The children cheered, and Cora threw her arms around Megan's neck, planting a kiss on her cheek. ""Aunt Megan is the best! Way better than Mom!""  
June's chest felt like someone had reached in and squeezed her heart with a fist.  
She caught the slight smile playing at Nicholas's lips--warmth he'd never once shown her.  
Unable to watch anymore, she grabbed her bag and walked out.  
The moment she stepped onto the sidewalk, memories from her past life hit her like a truck.  
In that life, she'd been mated to Nicholas through pack politics, had two pups, and dragged on until she was 62 without a single happy day.  
All because Nicholas's heart had always belonged to his first love, Megan Silvermoon.  
After they'd broken up, he'd gone on a three-day drinking bender, but his pride kept him from going after her. Instead, he'd gone through with the arranged mating to June.  
Nicholas had been her teenage crush--gorgeous as a movie star, the fantasy of every unmated she-wolf in the territory who dreamed of catching the Blackstone Alpha's attention.  
When she'd heard about the engagement, she thought she'd won the lottery.  
But after the mating ceremony, no matter how hard she tried to love him, all she got back was coldness and indifference.  
Then Megan came back from studying abroad in London.  
He never talked about breaking their bond, but his eyes never left Megan.  
Even worse, the pups started gravitating toward Megan, pulling away from her completely.  
In her final years, June had developed early-onset dementia, and Nicholas had her moved to the old family cabin upstate under the excuse of ""getting some peace and quiet.""  
On her 62nd birthday, she'd called her mate and pups with shaking hands, only to find out they were all in the Bahamas with Megan.  
She'd tried to make herself a simple birthday dinner, but her confused mind made her forget about the gas burner...  
As the flames consumed everything, the last thing June remembered was the cold look in Nicholas's eyes when he'd placed the mating mark on her neck all those years ago.  
In agony, she'd closed her eyes, wishing that if there was a next life, she'd never waste it on him again.  
When June got back to the pack house, it was already dark.  
She didn't even pause to rest. Instead, she went straight to work clearing everything out--Nicholas's clothes, the kids' toys, family photos--shoving it all into boxes.  
""What the hell are you doing?"" Nicholas's voice cut through the silence from behind her.  
June turned to see him standing in the doorway with the children, his face twisted in annoyance.  
""Mom, why are you throwing our stuff away?"" Cora ran over, her face going red when she saw her stuffed wolf in the donation box.  
Kai glared at her with pure anger. ""We just went to hang out with Aunt Megan for a little while. Is that really worth freaking out over?""  
Nicholas looked at June like she was some stranger causing trouble in his house. ""The kids like spending time with Megan. Is that really something to have a meltdown about?""  
""I'm not having a meltdown,"" June said quietly.  
""Liar!"" Cora screamed. ""You're just jealous of Aunt Megan! That's why you're throwing away my wolf--you're the worst mom ever!""  
""When I grow up, I'm moving in with Aunt Megan,"" Kai snarled, grabbing his sister's hand. ""And I'm never coming back to see you again!""  
Nicholas didn't even try to stop them. He just stood there with that familiar frown, looking at June like she was nothing more than an annoying problem to deal with.  
""Enough,"" he said, his voice carrying that natural authority as he straightened his watch. ""I've got a conference call with the West Coast packs. Do whatever you want, just keep it down.""  
The door slammed behind him, and June's tears finally came.  
Her heart felt like it was being ripped apart, every breath burning in her chest.  
She wiped her eyes and looked around at the mess, then let out a hollow laugh.  
Fine, she thought. She wouldn't bother him anymore--not for the rest of her life.

# Chapter 2

Ever since signing the mate dissolution papers, Luna June Blackstone had stopped handling pack duties altogether.  
She no longer dragged herself out of bed at five in the morning to prepare the special protein-rich meals growing werewolf pups needed, and she no longer stayed up late waiting for Alpha Nicholas Blackstone to stumble home from pack meetings so she could brew him the herbal tea that helped with the headaches that came after long shifts.  
All those responsibilities she'd once seen as her Luna duties were now dumped on the pack house staff.  
At first, no one picked up on the change.  
But then things started falling apart: Kai Blackstone showed up late for his combat training and got chewed out by the pack trainer, Cora Blackstone's homework went missing, and Nicholas Blackstone's silver watch stopped working completely.  
The staff scrambled around in a panic, but they could never quite match the standards June had set.  
The kitchen was a mess with unwashed dishes, the living room was covered in the pups' toys, and even the clothes came out of the laundry wrinkled no matter how hard they tried.  
What had once been a perfectly run pack house slowly turned into complete chaos.  
When Alpha Nicholas pushed open the bedroom door, June was sitting by the window reading a book.  
Sunlight came through the curtains, making shadows dance across her face.  
""How long are you gonna keep this up?"" he asked from the doorway, his voice that low growl that usually made pack members submit immediately.  
June closed her book and looked at him. ""I'm not causing any problems.""  
""Then why did you stop taking care of the house?"" He stepped closer, and she could smell his scent--pine and something wild that used to make her wolf purr. ""Are you still pissed about what happened before?""  
""I'm not pissed,"" she said, putting the book down. ""I just don't want to do it anymore.""  
Nicholas's eyes narrowed, his fingers drumming on the dresser. ""What's your excuse?""  
""I'm tired,"" she said simply. ""We have staff--I don't need to do everything myself.""  
In her head, she thought about her past life, when she'd gotten up before sunrise every single day: making Nicholas's coffee exactly how he liked it, preparing the kids' lunches, hand-washing their training clothes, even organizing his pack documents.  
But what had any of it gotten her? Nicholas being all lovey-dovey with Megan Silvermoon, the pups treating Aunt Megan like their real mom, and dying alone on her 62nd birthday.  
""June Blackstone,"" he said, his voice getting cold, ""if you're having some kind of breakdown, just say so. Don't act like a spoiled brat.""  
She almost smiled. ""I'm not having a breakdown. I just want to take a break.""  
Before she could say anything else, the door slammed open.  
Kai and Cora Blackstone ran in, their little faces red with anger.  
""Mom's being so lazy!"" Cora screamed. ""We want Aunt Megan to take care of us!""  
Kai jumped in, shouting, ""Aunt Megan is way nicer than you, way better at everything, and a million times cooler!""  
Nicholas stared at June, like he was waiting for her to back down.  
But she just took a deep breath and said quietly, ""If you all think she's so amazing, then go ahead and bring her here. I don't care.""  
The room went dead silent.  
Nicholas's face went dark. ""Are you serious right now?""  
June nodded. ""Completely serious.""  
""Dad, let's go!"" Cora said, pulling on Nicholas's arm with excitement. ""I want Aunt Megan here right now!""  
""With Aunt Megan here, we don't need you anymore!"" Kai said, making a face at June. ""Just leave--get out of our house!""  
Nicholas looked at June one more time, saw that she wasn't going to change her mind, and turned around, walking out with the kids.  
June stood there by herself, listening to their car drive away, and closed her eyes.  
Soon enough, she'd give them exactly what they wanted.  
She was going to leave them all behind for good.

# Chapter 3

On Megan Silvermoon's first day moving into the pack house, she had the staff completely redo the living room.  
""This couch is so boring,"" she said, running her perfectly manicured fingers over the leather as she smiled at Alpha Nicholas. ""Nick, what do you think about getting something in cream instead?""  
Without even thinking about it, Nicholas told the head of staff, Marcus: ""Do whatever Miss Silvermoon wants.""  
Luna June Blackstone stood at the top of the stairs, watching the workers carry out the couch she'd picked out just six months ago.  
Kai and Cora Blackstone followed Megan around like excited puppies, pointing at everything. ""Aunt Megan, we need to get rid of these pillows too! Mom's taste is so ugly!""  
Megan petted their heads gently. ""Don't worry, we'll change everything.""  
June's hands clenched into fists, then relaxed.  
Those pillows were ones she'd made by hand when she was pregnant, stuffed with special filling because the pups had sensitive skin as babies.  
Now they were getting thrown in the trash like garbage.  
Over the next few days, the house started feeling like a completely different place.  
At dinner, Megan sat in June's usual spot, cutting up food for the children and feeding them like they were still babies.  
Nicholas would pour her coffee himself, his big hands gentle in a way June had never seen before.  
At night, the lights would dim and all four of them would pile onto the couch to watch movies.  
Cora would curl up in Megan's lap, Kai would lean against Nicholas, and they'd all laugh together like they were the perfect family.  
When June walked by, none of them even looked at her, like she was invisible.  
The craziest part was how Nicholas, Kai, and Cora used to be super picky about everything being perfect.  
But now?  
June watched Megan carelessly toss Nicholas's expensive Rolex onto the coffee table, and he just picked it up with a smile. She saw the kids going to school in uniforms that Megan had thrown in the washing machine with stains still on them, and nobody said a word. She watched Megan serve them takeout and pretend she'd cooked it, and everyone just went along with it.  
Even worse, they were all spoiling Megan like crazy--  
""Megan, don't worry about cleaning up,"" Nicholas said, stopping her when she reached for some dishes, his fingers wrapping around her wrist. ""Your hands are too delicate for that kind of work.""  
""Aunt Megan, I'll carry your purse!"" Kai said eagerly, grabbing her designer bag with a look on his face that June had never seen when he looked at her.  
""Miss Silvermoon should just relax,"" Marcus said respectfully, bringing her expensive slippers. ""We'll take care of everything else.""  
It was so messed up.  
For six years, June had been running this house like she was the hired help, and nobody had ever appreciated it.  
But Megan shows up and suddenly she's treated like some kind of princess.  
The staff started whispering when they thought nobody could hear.  
""The Alpha's so different with Miss Silvermoon--I've never seen him act like that with the Luna.""  
""And the pups are obsessed with her. I bet we'll have a new Luna before the next full moon!""  
June had stopped caring about any of it. She just ignored everything and quietly started packing her stuff.  
Then that afternoon, her phone started ringing like crazy.  
""Luna! Young Kai and Miss Cora are having some kind of reaction at school! The paramedics are taking them to the hospital!""  
When June got to the hospital, the pups had already been rushed into the emergency room.  
Nicholas stood in the hallway with his jacket off and his tie loose, looking furious.  
""June Blackstone,"" he said, his voice low and dangerous. ""What the hell did you do?""  
She stared at him. ""What?""  
""They're allergic to moonlight grass--you know that."" He stepped closer, using his height to intimidate her. ""Why did you give them those energy bars with moonlight grass extract?""  
""I didn't!"" June looked him straight in the eye. ""I never buy anything with moonlight grass in it.""  
Ever since the pups had their first reaction to moonlight grass as babies, she'd been super careful, checking every single ingredient and even calling the pack healer to make sure their supplements were safe.  
""You didn't?"" Nicholas laughed, but there was no humor in it. ""Then who did? The staff? Or did they just decide to poison themselves?""  
June started to answer, but a nurse came out of the room. ""The children are awake now.""  
In the hospital room, Kai and Cora were lying in bed looking pale and weak.  
""What happened?"" Nicholas asked in his Alpha voice.  
Both kids looked at each other, then pointed right at June. ""It was Mom! She gave us those bars even though she knew we couldn't have them!""  
June felt like she'd been punched in the stomach. ""What are you talking about?""

# Chapter 4

""It was Mom!"" Cora Blackstone cried, tears streaming down her face. ""She knew we were allergic, but she gave them to us anyway!""  
Kai Blackstone nodded hard. ""She's horrible!""  
Luna June Blackstone grabbed the doorframe so tight her knuckles went white. ""Kai, Cora, do you understand what you're saying? You better tell the truth right now!""  
""Enough!"" Alpha Nicholas shot up and grabbed her wrist so hard she thought he might break it. ""June Blackstone, is this what kind of mother you are? Not only hurting them, but making them lie about it?""  
""I didn't..."" June's voice shook.  
""So you're saying they're lying?"" He looked at her like she was dirt. ""They're just pups. If you can't even admit what you did, do you even deserve to be their mother?""  
The two pups started crying harder, and Nicholas let go of June to comfort them.  
Their cries got louder and more desperate, their little faces turning red.  
""Daddy..."" Cora sobbed, ""we feel so sick...""  
""What can I do to make you feel better?"" Nicholas asked softly, wiping away her tears.  
Kai glared at June with his eyes all red and puffy. ""She's allergic to moonlight grass too--make her eat some! Then she'll know how it feels!""  
June felt ice cold all over.  
She looked at Nicholas, and the look in his eyes made her want to run.  
""Fine.""  
He stood up and snapped his fingers, and two of his enforcers came through the door.  
""Hold her.""  
Before June could move, they had her pinned in a chair.  
One of them grabbed her jaw and forced her mouth open.  
They shoved a concentrated moonlight grass tablet down her throat, the bitter herb making her gag and choke as it burned her throat.  
Hives started spreading across her skin immediately, her face began to swell up, and she couldn't breathe right.  
She clawed at her neck, everything going blurry as she stared at Nicholas.  
He just stood there watching, not doing anything to stop it.  
The pups had stopped crying and were clapping their hands. ""Good! She deserves it! Now she knows how bad it feels!""  
Right before everything went black, the last thing June saw was the cold look in Alpha Nicholas Blackstone's eyes.  
...  
When June woke up, she was in a hospital bed.  
Her throat still felt like someone had shoved sandpaper down it, and there were still red welts all over her skin.  
She could hear voices outside her room--one of them was Megan Silvermoon.  
""Nick, I had no idea they couldn't have moonlight grass... I just wanted to help them get stronger for their training...""  
""It's not your fault,"" Alpha Nicholas said, his voice all gentle. ""You were trying to help.""  
""I should have asked first, then this whole mess with June wouldn't have happened."" She sounded so sorry. ""And Kai, Cora, you shouldn't have covered for me and blamed your mom.""  
The pups' voices came through the door, sounding all sad:  
""Aunt Megan, we're sorry..."" Cora sniffled. ""We just... we just don't like Mom...""  
""Yeah,"" Kai said, ""she's always telling us what to do and never lets us have fun... We want her to go away...""  
June's fingers grabbed the hospital sheets so hard her knuckles went white again.  
These were the pups she'd carried for months, almost dying when she gave birth to them.  
She remembered when Kai was born and nobody was waiting outside the delivery room.  
A nurse told her that Nicholas was busy with pack business and couldn't come.  
She'd gone through all that pain by herself.  
And when Cora was born, it was even worse--there were complications and she almost bled to death, with the doctors saying she might not make it.  
Nicholas had been in Europe dealing with some territorial dispute.  
And now these same pups that she'd almost died bringing into the world were the ones hurting her the most!",1,1755850016.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I’ve had my Quickmill 3035 for about 2 months now and I’ve noticed that the *single shot basket* keeps getting stuck in the group head when I try to pull it out. It happens almost every time, and I have to wiggle or pry it out. Sometimes just the coffee sticks to the group head, which is even worse to clean. 

The reason I’m sticking with the single basket is that I really enjoy small shots throughout the day — when I use the double basket, I end up with too much coffee and don’t finish it. And of course, I don't like wasting coffee. 

Is this kind of sticking issue normal with single baskets, or could it be a problem with my machine (maybe a factory defect)? And if it’s just the way singles are, what’s the best workaround or upgrade?

Thanks for any advice!",1,1755849785.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

By day, I was his perfect assistant—calm, capable, invisible.  
By night, I was his secret—someone he touched but never truly saw.  
I thought if I stayed long enough, worked hard enough, maybe one day he’d choose me.  
But when his “true love” came back, I finally understood—I was never in his heart. Just a stand-in. A shadow.  
He let me get hurt. Watched me be humiliated. All to protect her.  
That’s when I walked away—for real this time. I built a new life without him. Found peace, success… even love.  
Now he’s standing in front of me again, saying:  
“If you still have space in your heart for me…”  
I looked him in the eye and smiled—  
But I didn’t tell him he might be the one waiting this time.

# Chapter One

""Ms. Summers, your resignation has been approved by Mr. Cross, but he doesn't realize it's you who's quitting. Should I give him a heads up?""  
I stared at my phone, letting the HR manager's words sink in. ""No, don't bother. Just leave it.""  
""But you've been Mr. Cross's personal assistant for four years. He always says you're the best he's ever had. Are you sure you want to go through with this?""  
The concern in her voice almost made me laugh. The best he's ever had. If only she knew what that really meant.  
""Look, my parents are getting older and need help back home. I'm going back to get married anyway—my mom's already got someone lined up."" The lie rolled off my tongue easily. ""Since Mr. Cross signed off on it, I'll wrap everything up and be gone in a month.""  
I hung up and went back to packing my things.  
Three years I'd lived in this penthouse. Three years of pretending this was home when it was never really mine. I kept only the essentials and tossed everything else into garbage bags. No point in dragging reminders with me.  
Standing in the empty bedroom, memories hit me like a freight train.  
Eight years ago, I was just some small-town girl who somehow got into Columbia University. That's where I met Wren Cross—Manhattan royalty, old money, the kind of girl who wore designer clothes to grab coffee. We shouldn't have been friends, but somehow we clicked. She dragged me to fancy parties, introduced me to her world, and that's when I first saw him.  
Damon Cross. Her older brother.  
God, he was everything I'd never had—sophisticated, powerful, unreachable. I fell hard and kept it locked up tight because girls like me don't get guys like him.  
After graduation, Wren jetted off to Paris for her master's degree. I stayed in Manhattan and did something crazy—I applied to be Damon's personal assistant. Just to be near him. Just to see him every day.  
For two years, I was the perfect employee. Professional, efficient, invisible. Until that night when everything changed.  
Someone had spiked his drink at a business dinner. I was going to call his doctor, but he was already losing control. One minute I was helping him to his car, the next he had me pressed against the elevator wall, his mouth on mine like he was drowning and I was air.  
We barely made it to his penthouse before his hands were everywhere, tearing at my clothes, whispering my name against my neck. That night, I gave him everything I'd been saving for someone who might actually love me back.  
When I woke up, he was sitting by the window, fully dressed, smoking a cigarette like nothing had happened.  
""Do you have feelings for me?"" His voice was cold, businesslike.  
I opened my mouth to deny it, but he cut me off.  
""You blush every time I walk into a room. You know how I take my coffee, what meetings I hate, when I need space. You took this job right after college."" He turned to look at me, and his eyes were empty. ""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""  
My face burned with shame. He'd seen right through me.  
Then he pulled out a credit card and set it on the nightstand.  
""Last night was a mistake. I'm in love with someone else, and I can't give you what you want. Wren told me your family doesn't have much money. There's enough on that card to set you up for life. Take it and forget this happened.""  
I remembered hearing him call out a name in the dark—Brynn. Wren had told me about her once. Brynn Mitchell, Damon's college girlfriend, the one who broke his heart when she moved to London after graduation. He'd been waiting for her to come back ever since.  
""Our family doesn't do love,"" Wren had said over wine one night. ""But my brother's different. He's been hung up on Brynn for years. Says everyone else is just settling, and he won't settle.""  
Looking at him now, I understood exactly what she meant.  
But I didn't want his money. I wanted him.  
""I don't want the card,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""I want you to give me a chance. Give us a chance. If she comes back and you still want her, I'll walk away. But until then...""  
He stared at me for the longest moment, then grabbed his jacket and headed for the door.  
""Fine,"" he said without looking back. ""But don't expect anything more than this.""  
That's how it started. During the day, I was his assistant—professional, competent, invisible. At night, I was his secret. We had sex in his office after board meetings, in the back of his Mercedes after client dinners, against the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse while the city glittered below us.  
Four years of being his best-kept secret. Four years of pretending I was okay with stolen moments and empty promises.  
I thought I could live with it forever.  
Then three days ago, everything fell apart.  
It was his birthday, and I'd planned the perfect surprise—his favorite dinner, expensive wine, lingerie that cost half my paycheck. I waited in his penthouse until midnight, watching the candles burn down to nothing.  
Instead of Damon, I got a notification from Instagram.  
He never posted anything personal. His account was all business—company events, award ceremonies, professional headshots. But there it was, posted at 11:47 PM: a photo of him kissing someone under a massive fireworks display in Central Park.  
""Best birthday gift ever—getting back what I thought I'd lost forever.""  
The woman in his arms was stunning—blonde, elegant, everything I wasn't. The caption had dozens of comments from their mutual friends, all congratulating them on their reunion.  
Brynn Mitchell was back.  
My hands shook as I called his phone. It rang twice before someone picked up.  
""Hello?"" A woman's voice, slightly breathless.  
""Um, hi. Is Damon there?""  
""Damon, there's some woman on your phone. She's not saying anything.""  
I heard rustling, then his voice, warm and tender in a way he'd never spoken to me.  
""Just some work thing, babe. Probably a wrong number. Come back to bed.""  
Some work thing. Four years, and that's all I was.  
I hung up and started packing.  
When he came home the next morning, he found me loading boxes into my car.  
""Moving out?"" His tone was casual, like he was asking about the weather.  
""Yeah. Found a place closer to work."" Another lie. I'd rented a studio apartment month-to-month because I wasn't planning to stay in Manhattan much longer.  
He frowned. ""Month-to-month? Why?""  
I almost told him about the resignation letter, but he was already checking his phone, distracted.  
""It's snowing pretty hard,"" he said. ""Let me drive you.""  
I wanted to refuse, but the snow was coming down in thick sheets, and I didn't have much choice.  
His Mercedes looked completely different. The sleek black interior was now filled with pink accessories—fuzzy seat covers, Hello Kitty air fresheners, candy scattered across the dashboard. It was like stepping into a teenager's bedroom.  
""Brynn likes cute things,"" he explained when he saw me staring.  
I forced a smile. ""That's nice. I'm happy you two found each other again.""  
Something flickered across his face, but before he could respond, his phone buzzed.  
""Hey, beautiful,"" he answered, his voice going soft. ""Build a snowman? Right now? But it's freezing..."" A pause, then a laugh. ""Okay, okay. I'll be right there.""  
He pulled over and looked at me apologetically. ""I have to—""  
""It's fine."" I was already getting out. ""I can catch a cab from here.""  
The snow was falling harder now, and the street was empty. Damon helped me get my boxes out of the trunk, and that's when disaster struck. The bottom of one box gave way, spilling everything onto the wet sidewalk.  
Under the streetlight, it was all there for him to see—years of pathetic proof of my obsession. Love letters I'd written but never sent. Photos I'd taken of him when he wasn't looking. Things he'd thrown away that I'd saved like some kind of deranged collector.  
My face burned with humiliation as I scrambled to gather everything up.  
""Sorry,"" I mumbled. ""Sorry, I—""  
But when I looked up, he was already getting back in his car. He drove away without another word, leaving me kneeling in the snow with my broken heart scattered around me.  
I waited forty-five minutes for a cab that never came. Finally, I started walking, dragging my boxes through the snow. A delivery bike came out of nowhere and clipped me, sending me sprawling across the sidewalk. The rider didn't even stop.  
Blood soaked through my jeans where the pavement had torn up my leg. The cut was deep, maybe eight inches long, and it hurt like hell. I sat in the snow for ten minutes, too stunned to move.  
By the time I made it back to my apartment, it was past 3 AM. I cleaned and bandaged the wound as best I could, then collapsed on my mattress and checked my phone.  
One new message from Damon, sent right after he'd left me in the street:  
""Stop wasting your life on someone who doesn't want you. There are plenty of other guys out there. Find one who actually gives a damn.""  
I stared at those words until they blurred together.  
Then I got dressed, went outside, and found a metal trash can in the alley behind my building. I dumped everything from that box inside—the letters, the photos, all of it—and set it on fire.  
As the flames ate up eight years of my life, I made myself a promise.  
You're right, Damon. I'll do exactly what you said.  
The fire burned until there was nothing left but ash and smoke.  
Just like my feelings for him.

# Chapter Two

Monday morning came too fast. I dragged myself to the office, my leg still aching from the accident, and tried to pretend everything was normal.  
I went through the motions—checking emails, organizing Damon's schedule, preparing for the 2 PM board meeting with Steinberg Industries and Parker Holdings. Just another day being the perfect assistant.  
When I walked to his office to remind him about the meeting, the door was slightly open. What I saw inside made my stomach drop.  
Brynn was sitting on his lap, feeding him pieces of some fancy pastry. The same man who usually went ballistic if someone left crumbs on his desk was letting her get frosting all over his shirt.  
""These are amazing,"" he said, his voice softer than I'd ever heard it. ""Just like the ones from that little bakery in SoHo you used to love.""  
""I can't believe you remembered,"" she giggled, offering him another bite. ""And I can't believe you actually waited in line for three hours to get them. You're the CEO of a Fortune 500 company—couldn't you just send someone?""  
Damon's hands were on her waist, his thumbs rubbing small circles against her skin. ""Anything for you, I want to handle myself. I'm not delegating you to anyone ever again.""  
She melted into him, and they started kissing deeply, lost in each other like they were alone in the world instead of in a glass office where anyone could see.  
I dug my nails into my palms so hard I drew blood. The meeting was in ten minutes, and some of the biggest names in Manhattan were already in the conference room.  
I knocked on the door. ""Mr. Cross, the Steinberg Industries meeting starts in ten minutes.""  
Damon pulled back from Brynn, but she grabbed his tie and pulled him back down.  
""Don't go yet,"" she pouted. ""I just got you back. Can't work wait?""  
""Postpone the meeting by two hours,"" he said without even looking at me.  
My heart stopped. ""Sir, the executives from Steinberg Industries, Parker Holdings, and Morrison Group are already here. This deal is critical for the company's future—""  
""God, your assistant is so annoying,"" Brynn interrupted, rolling her eyes. ""She really doesn't know when to back off!""  
Damon's expression went ice cold. ""I said postpone it by two hours. Nothing is more important than Brynn!""  
The words hit me like a physical blow. Everyone in our industry knew Damon Cross was a workaholic. He'd work through illness, exhaustion, anything. But now he was risking major partnerships just because his girlfriend wanted attention.  
I closed the door and walked to the conference room to face the music.  
""Gentlemen, I'm afraid Mr. Cross has been delayed. He's asked to reschedule for 4 PM.""  
The room exploded with angry voices. They couldn't take their frustration out on Damon, so they took it out on me. For two solid hours, I sat there getting yelled at by powerful men in expensive suits while Damon was probably having sex with Brynn in his office.  
When he finally showed up at 4 PM, looking perfectly composed, I could barely stand. My legs were numb, my head was pounding, and I felt like I was going to collapse.  
As I limped out of the conference room, Brynn appeared in the hallway.  
""You must be Ivy,"" she said with a smile that didn't reach her eyes. ""Damon's told me so much about you. I hear you make great coffee.""  
""Everyone looks so tired after that long meeting. Why don't you make coffee for everyone in the office? I'll take mine iced with no sugar.""  
It wasn't a request. It was a command.  
I spent the next two hours brewing coffee for over 400 people across multiple floors. My hands were shaking from exhaustion, and the cut on my leg had started bleeding again, but I didn't dare stop.  
When I finally brought Brynn her iced coffee, she took one sip and her face twisted in disgust.  
""This is terrible!"" she said loudly, making sure everyone could hear. ""I specifically said no ice because I'm on my period and the cold makes my cramps worse!""  
Before I could respond, she hurled the ceramic mug at my head.  
The mug shattered against my forehead, and I felt warm blood trickling down my face. But Brynn wasn't done. She grabbed cup after cup from the cart, throwing them at me while I curled up on the floor trying to protect myself.  
""Pathetic!"" she spat. ""You can't even follow simple instructions!""  
Cold coffee soaked through my clothes, mixing with the blood from cuts all over my arms and face. The whole office watched in silence—no one dared to help me, and no one dared to stop her.  
That's when Damon walked out of his office.  
""What the hell is going on here?""  
Brynn immediately switched to tears. ""I asked for coffee with no ice because I'm on my period and my cramps are killing me. But she gave me iced coffee anyway, and when I tried to explain, she got defensive and started throwing things around!""  
I looked up at him, bleeding and broken on the floor. ""That's not what happened.""  
""You've been my assistant for four years,"" he said coldly. ""You can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some kind of problem with Brynn and you're deliberately targeting her?""  
""Sir, I—""  
""Dock her monthly salary and quarterly bonus,"" he told another assistant. ""And issue a company-wide memo. She needs to make a public apology at next week's general meeting.""  
Then he picked up Brynn like she was made of glass and carried her away, leaving me bleeding on the floor surrounded by broken ceramic and spilled coffee.

# Chapter Three

I don't know how long I lay there before some of the kinder employees came to help me clean up. They spoke in whispers, shooting nervous glances toward Damon's office.  
""I heard her specifically ask for iced coffee with no sugar,"" one of them said quietly. ""How is she claiming she wanted it without ice now? Ivy, did you do something to offend her?""  
""It doesn't matter what we heard,"" another replied. ""She's clearly just spoiled and throws tantrums when things don't go her way. A lot of people in our circle can't stand her, but because Damon's protecting her, nobody dares to cross her.""  
""I've never seen Damon like someone this much. Ivy, you need to be careful from now on. We're just regular employees—we can't compete with a rich princess like her. She's got Damon backing her up, so even if you get wronged, you'll just have to take it.""  
I knew they meant well, but hearing these words made my heart ache even more.  
In the past, when I'd handled contracts and clients blamed me for their own mistakes, Damon always defended me. He'd argue with them until my name was cleared.  
But now, with Brynn telling just one lie, he didn't even bother to verify the facts or give me a chance to explain. He just blamed everything on me.  
I'd worked so hard for him, handled so many problems, but in the end, there wasn't even this basic level of trust?  
Or maybe in his heart, right and wrong didn't matter—he just wanted to keep Brynn happy?  
The thought made my chest tight with pain.  
It took me forever to clean everything up. When I finally dragged my exhausted body home, my phone rang.  
""Bring heating pads and brown sugar. The kind for women's health issues.""  
Of course. Princess Brynn needed to be pampered.  
I stopped at three different stores to find everything on his list, then drove to his penthouse. The place looked completely different from just a few days ago.  
The elegant black and white furniture was gone, replaced with pink and gold everything. The minimalist décor he'd always preferred was buried under throw pillows, stuffed animals, and inspirational quote posters. Display cases were filled with jewelry, designer bags, and expensive gifts.  
It was like walking into a teenage girl's bedroom.  
I knocked on the bedroom door, and Damon answered wearing just his robe. His hair was messy, his lips slightly swollen—they'd clearly been busy.  
""Jesus, Ivy. Your face looks awful. Did you see a doctor?""  
I shook my head.  
He frowned, his voice softening slightly. ""Look, Brynn's just not feeling well. She didn't mean to take it out on you. Don't hold it against her. I'll add the salary I docked back into your year-end bonus. Go to the hospital and get checked out. If it's serious, take some time off—I'll approve it without any paperwork.""  
""Actually, sir, after this month ends, I—""  
""Oh, and I need you to organize a welcome party for Brynn. Something classy. Spare no expense.""  
The words I'd been about to say—about my resignation—got stuck in my throat.  
""Of course, sir.""  
He closed the door, and immediately I heard Brynn's voice.  
""Is the brown sugar tea ready? And I need you to rub my stomach...""  
""Coming right now, baby. Just lie back and don't move.""  
His voice was so gentle, so tender. I'd never heard him speak to anyone like that.  
I remembered all the times I'd had severe menstrual cramps, sometimes fainting from the pain at work and having colleagues rush me to the hospital. Damon knew about it—he'd approved my sick leave. But he'd never brought me tea or heating pads. Never rubbed my stomach or called me baby.  
Back then, I thought it was because he was too busy with work.  
But now I realized it was just because he didn't care about me enough.  
After leaving his place, I went to the hospital and got my cuts bandaged. Then I spent the next few days recovering and planning Brynn's party.  
During my recovery, the company group chat was buzzing with gossip about Damon and Brynn.  
Did you see his Instagram? He rented out the entire Disneyland for her birthday!  
Those fireworks over Central Park lasted three whole days! Must have cost a fortune!  
I heard he's buying land to build her a private ski resort!  
I watched these messages with a completely numb heart.

# Chapter Four

The party was held at the Rainbow Room—sixty-five floors above Manhattan with stunning views of the city. I'd arranged everything perfectly: a string quartet, Michelin-starred catering, white roses and gold accents everywhere.  
Brynn made her grand entrance in a custom designer gown that probably cost more than I made in a year. Every conversation stopped when she walked in.  
""Brynn Mitchell,"" people whispered admiringly. ""She's even more gorgeous than in the photos.""  
""I remember back in college, when guys would ask her out, Damon would find out and make them transfer schools. He'd tear up any love letters she got, and if anyone talked badly about her, he'd beat them up so badly they'd end up with broken bones...""  
""Everyone in our circle knows Brynn is Damon's one true love. Look at that jewelry she's wearing—must be worth millions. And that dress is custom couture, one of a kind. Damon never holds back when it comes to making Brynn happy!""  
I stood in the corner, making sure everything ran smoothly, listening to people praise the woman who'd destroyed my life.  
Brynn spotted me and walked over with a triumphant smile.  
""The party's lovely, but there's an issue. There's no red carpet, and my dress is getting dirty on the floor. To make up for this oversight, you need to hold up my train.""  
""Ma'am, I can have staff lay down a carpet runner immediately—""  
""I said hold up my train.""  
Damon appeared beside her. ""What's wrong?""  
""Your assistant is being difficult again. I asked her to help with my dress, and she's refusing. Is she still holding a grudge from the other day?""  
Damon pulled her into his arms and looked at me with cold disapproval. ""Holding up a dress is part of your job anyway. You've been an assistant for years—can't you handle something this simple?""  
The guests around us started whispering and snickering.  
""An assistant giving attitude to Miss Brynn? She doesn't know her place!""  
""Some people are born to be served, others to serve. Being asked to hold a dress at a party should be an honor—don't be ungrateful.""  
Hearing these mocking comments, I felt my last shred of dignity crumble. I bent down and lifted the heavy, beaded train of her gown.  
Brynn deliberately paraded me around the entire venue—upstairs, downstairs, through every room. The dress was embedded with pearls and crystals that cut into my hands, and my arms went numb from holding it up, but I had no choice but to endure.  
When she finally got tired of humiliating me, she had servers bring over several bottles of wine.  
""I'm supposed to toast tonight, but I'm on medication that doesn't mix with alcohol. So you'll drink for me.""  
""I'm allergic to alcohol, ma'am...""  
""Damon!"" she called out dramatically. ""Look at her!""  
Damon knew about my severe alcohol allergy—I'd ended up in the ER before after accidentally consuming alcohol. But to appease Brynn, he just said, ""Don't you carry allergy medication? Take some and then drink. You'll be fine.""  
My heart sank. I silently took antihistamines and started drinking glass after glass. My throat began to close up, my vision blurred, and my stomach churned violently.  
In my dizzying haze, I heard Brynn suddenly scream.  
""My necklace! The diamond necklace Damon gave me is missing! She was the only one close to me—she must have stolen it!""  
""I didn't take anything,"" I slurred, barely able to speak.  
Damon looked at Brynn's tearful face, then at me, drunk and disheveled. His expression darkened.  
""There were lots of people around. Maybe it just fell somewhere. Let's search first?""  
But Brynn wouldn't hear it. ""Who else could it be? You gave me that necklace—of course I'm upset! But you're still protecting her. If you won't search her, then don't bother coming to find me!""  
She started to storm off, but Damon quickly pulled her back and coldly signaled to his security team.  
Security tackled me and tried to search me right there in front of everyone—ripping open my bag, pulling at my coat—until someone shouted they’d found the necklace by the stairs.  
Instantly, every eye in the room turned to the glittering diamond necklace in their hands. Damon's expression relaxed slightly as he waved the guards away. He took the necklace and personally fastened it around Brynn's neck.  
""See? It's found. Don't be upset anymore, okay?""  
Brynn stopped crying and smiled through her tears. She looked down at me on the floor, half-naked and wretched, then clung to Damon's arm sweetly.  
""Thank goodness we found it, or I would have been devastated. But your assistant went through such an ordeal because of this. Should I apologize to her?""  
Suddenly all eyes turned to me, curled up on the floor trying to cover myself. Facing all those malicious stares, I heard Damon's indifferent voice.  
""No need to apologize. She's just an assistant. Going through a little hardship isn't a big deal.""

# Chapter Five

Those words cut through me like a knife, tearing my heart to shreds.  
My mind went numb. My vision went empty. Everything inside me just... died.  
The party guests had all left at some point, leaving only harsh lights illuminating the wreckage of my dignity on the floor.  
I forced myself to stand, wrapped myself in a coat some kind server had given me, and stumbled out into the night.  
It was pouring rain. I walked into it without even realizing, letting the cold drops hit my face and slide down like the tears I couldn't cry anymore.  
I wandered aimlessly through the streets, not knowing where I was going or caring.  
After a while, a car pulled up beside me. The window rolled down, revealing Damon's face.  
""Get in the car.""  
I kept walking like I hadn't heard him.  
""Ivy, get in the car.""  
I stopped and looked at him with empty eyes. ""No need to concern yourself, Mr. Cross. I'm just an assistant, after all.""  
My cold tone made something flicker across his face.  
He got out and walked over to me in the rain, grabbing my hand. ""What happened tonight—I didn't handle it well. But I lost Brynn once before. I can't lose her again. What you went through, I'll find a way to make it up to you. Don't be angry with me about this.""  
For the first time, I didn't give in.  
I used my last bit of strength to pull free from his grip, stepping back. My voice was flat, emotionless.  
""Mr. Cross, you're joking. How could someone ordinary like me dare to be angry with you and Miss Mitchell? I was just too naive before, not understanding my place. From now on, I'll remember that I'm just an assistant and won't disturb your life anymore. Are you satisfied? Can you let me go now?""  
The more I spoke like this, the more agitated he became.  
""You know that's not what I meant! I never looked down on you. What I said was just to calm Brynn down. In my heart, you're like Wren—""  
I didn't hear whatever else he said. The world was spinning, my eyelids felt like lead, and all my strength was draining away.  
My body swayed, and everything went black.  
I don't know how much time passed before I woke up in a hospital bed. My wet clothes had been changed, my wounds bandaged, and there was medicine and water on the bedside table.  
A nurse was adjusting my IV. When she saw me awake, she smiled kindly.  
""You're awake! Your boyfriend stayed here all night. He just left to get something.""  
I opened my dry lips, my voice hoarse. ""He's not my boyfriend. He never was.""  
What Damon and I had from the beginning was just an accident. Besides my role as his assistant, he'd never acknowledged any other relationship between us.  
I used to deceive myself, fantasizing about a future together.  
But now I just wanted to wake up from that dream and leave this place forever.",1,1755849721.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

She wasn't supposed to check it. But her fingers betrayed her, swiping the screen, unlocking it with no code at all, as if daring her to look.
The messages glared back.
Melissa: Miss you already. Can't wait until Friday.
Jake: Friday can't come soon enough. Been thinking about that dress all day. You in red? Deadly.
Emily's throat tightened. Melissa Wright. His assistant.
Two weeks later, a sweltering Wednesday in late May. 
And there they were.
Jake Carter. Undressed.
Melissa Wright. Also undressed.
Tangling sheets, tangled bodies. The bedframe squeaked like a rat giving testimony.
""Dada nakey!"" Ollie pointed with his juice box, delighted. ""An' dat not Mama! Dat Missa Wite! From Daddy work!""
Emily's lip twitched. She turned to Jake. ""Hotel. Or your mother's. You're not staying here tonight. Or tomorrow. And you will not contact me except about Ollie.""
Jake winced. ""Em, please. I'll end it with her. I already—""
""Already what?"" Emily snapped. ""Already lied to me? Already promised me this was 'nothing'? Already used my guest room like a cheap motel?""
______________

Los Angeles had a way of tricking people into thinking everything was perfect. The sunshine made even cracked sidewalks look cinematic, the palm trees waved like extras in a film, and if you ignored the traffic and smog, you might almost believe life was easy here.
Emily Carter knew better. She sat cross-legged on the bedroom carpet of her Spanish-style bungalow in Silver Lake, staring at the ugliest piece of plastic she'd ever held.
A neon-green phone case grinned up at her. On the back, in bold black font, the words read: WORK HARD. PLAY HARDER.
It looked cheap, tacky. Jake's taste ran to leather wallets and polished cufflinks. But she'd found this one shoved in the bottom of his sock drawer, under the novelty Christmas socks he pretended he didn't own.
Her first thought was: That's weird. Her second thought was: Burner phone. And her third thought—the one she couldn't shake—was: affair.
Emily wasn't supposed to check it. She wasn't the snooping type. She wasn't paranoid. But her fingers betrayed her, swiping the screen, unlocking it with no code at all, as if daring her to look.
The messages glared back.
Melissa: You were electric today. The way you handled that client? I wanted to drag you into the copy room right then.
Jake: You make work worth it, you know that?
Melissa: Next time, bring the red tie. The one that makes your eyes look dangerous.
Jake: Anything for you, Miss.
Emily's throat tightened. Melissa Wright. His assistant. The Melissa with sharp heels and sharp smiles, who always seemed a little too eager at work events. The Melissa who once offered to babysit Ollie.
Emily scrolled further, stomach sinking like the Ferris wheel at Santa Monica Pier.
Melissa: Miss you already. Can't wait until Friday.
Jake: Friday can't come soon enough. Been thinking about that dress all day. You in red? Deadly.
Emily dropped the phone onto the carpet like it burned.
Her heart pounded. Her wedding band pressed cold against her lips as she covered her mouth.
Seven years of marriage. Three years of parenting. Countless nights staying up with Ollie so Jake could sleep before meetings. A mortgage, joint accounts, family photos on the wall. And this.
She thought about confronting him right then. Marching into his office, throwing the phone at his head, demanding honesty. But some quiet, survivalist part of her whispered: Don't give him a chance to lie his way out. Wait. Catch him. Then the truth isn't a debate—it's evidence.
So she waited.
⸻
It happened two weeks later, on a sweltering Wednesday in late May.
Emily picked up Ollie early from his preschool near Echo Park. Ms. Rawiri, his teacher, smiled apologetically at the door. ""Staff meeting—sorry, can you grab him an hour early?""
""No problem,"" Emily said, sliding her sunglasses down.
Ollie came barreling out, juice mustache across his lip, Velcro sneakers lighting up with each stomp. ""Mamaaa! Look!"" He shoved a crayon masterpiece at her. It looked like a rainbow had fainted.
""It's beautiful,"" Emily said, buckling him into the car seat.
They drove through sun-bleached streets, the Hollywood sign peeking in the distance like it knew secrets. Emily planned tacos for dinner, maybe an early bath for Ollie, maybe an hour to herself with her baking show.
Then she pulled into the driveway.
Jake's car was there. Middle of the afternoon.
Her stomach twisted.
Inside, the house was too quiet. LA never stayed silent—leaf blowers, helicopters, car alarms—but here it was, except for a faint rhythm upstairs.
Emily froze.
""Mama,"" Ollie whispered loudly (which is to say not quietly at all), ""why da walls makin' bumpy noises?""
Her breath caught. Not here, not in front of him.
""Stay here, Ollie,"" she whispered, setting her bag down.
""Nooo, Mama,"" he whined. ""I big boy. I come too. Sneak sneak.""
And sneak sneak he did, juice box in hand, narrating like a toddler spy.
""Tip-toe... tip-toe... monster upstairs!""
Emily reached the guest room door. It was cracked open. She pushed it.
And there they were.
Jake Carter. Undressed.
Melissa Wright. Also undressed.
Tangling sheets, tangled bodies. The bedframe squeaked like a rat giving testimony.
For a heartbeat, nobody moved.
Then Ollie's voice, clear as a trumpet:
""Dada nakey!"" He pointed with his juice box, delighted. ""An' dat not Mama! Dat Missa Wite! From Daddy work!""
Melissa squeaked, clutching the sheet. Jake scrambled, half-wrapping himself like a toga model from inferno.
""Em,"" Jake stammered. ""It's not—""
""Don't,"" Emily snapped. Her voice cut the air clean.
Ollie gasped like he'd cracked a case. ""Mamaaaa, I heard Daddy talkin'! He say he miss a 'lissa, say he wanna peck her!!"" He puckered his lips, spraying juice. ""Mwah mwah mwah!""
Melissa groaned. Jake turned beet red.
Emily arched a brow. ""Oh, really?""
Ollie doubled down. ""He say, 'Ohhh, Missa, I miss yooou, I peck yooou,' like dat!"" He puckered again. ""Mwah mwah mwah!""
Jake's face crumpled. Melissa hid behind the sheet.
""Pants,"" Emily ordered.
""Mamaaaa,"" Ollie interrupted, tugging her arm. ""I still want nuggies.""
Emily's lip twitched. She turned to Jake. ""Hotel. Or your mother's. You're not staying here tonight. Or tomorrow. And you will not contact me except about Ollie. And this—"" she held up the neon-green phone—""is mine now.""
Jake deflated. ""Em, I love you. I love Ollie. I'll do anything.""
""Good,"" Emily said. ""Start by leaving.""
Ollie climbed onto the chair, solemn. ""Dada, you in time-out. Big boy time-out. Ten minutes."" He spread all ten fingers. ""An' bring me da blue car wif fwames tomowwow. You 'member.""
Jake's eyes watered. ""I remember.""
Emily scooped Ollie up. ""Come on, bug. Nuggets for us.""
Ollie grinned. ""Yay! Nuggies for me. No nuggies for Dada. Dada in da bin!""
And for the first time in weeks, Emily laughed. Really laughed.

Jake Carter smelled like panic and hotel soap.
He stood in the doorway of the kitchen like a man waiting for execution. Shirt wrinkled, tie hanging from his pocket, hair damp as though he'd showered shame away. Spoiler: it didn't work.
Emily, on the other hand, was calmly sliding nuggets onto a tray like she was loading ammunition. Curly fries followed. She preheated the oven to 220 and closed the door with a satisfying click.
Ollie, perched on his booster seat at the table, banged a plastic fork against the wood like a war drum. ""Nuggies! Nuggies! Nuggies!""
""Yes, bug,"" Emily said without looking at Jake. ""You're getting your nuggets. Unlike some people who lost their nugget privileges indefinitely.""
Jake flinched. ""Em—""
""Don't,"" she said, cutting him off as she shook salt onto the fries. ""Not a word until I finish seasoning. I don't want your excuses in my paprika.""
Ollie giggled. ""No 'scuses in da papwika, Dada!"" He shoved his juice box straw up his nose and snorted. ""Mwaaaah!""
Emily smirked despite herself. Her son was chaos incarnate, but he was hers. When she wasn't at work or when Ollie wasn't at school, he was with her. Grocery store, yoga class, Target runs, even when she dropped off paperwork at her office—Ollie was there. Her shadow. Her sanity. The one constant she could trust.
She turned, leaning against the counter, arms folded. ""Go ahead, Jake. Start your grovel.""
Jake tried a smile. It came out more like food poisoning. ""Em, I made a mistake. A huge mistake. I got caught up in something that didn't mean anything—""
Emily barked a laugh. ""Didn't mean anything? You've been playing undressed Twister in my guest room with your assistant, Jake. If it didn't mean anything, then what exactly does something mean?""
Ollie raised his hand like he was in court. ""Dada say Missa mean everyfing.""
Jake's head snapped. ""What?""
Emily arched an eyebrow. ""Go on, Ollie.""
""Mhm."" Ollie nodded earnestly, juice mustache glistening. ""Dada on da phone last week. He say, 'Missa, you da whole cake, but Memily just da frosting.'""
Emily's jaw dropped. Then she barked out a sharp laugh that held no humor at all. ""Cake. I'm frosting now?"" She shook her head. ""Well, Jake, congratulations. You picked the wrong bakery. Because this frosting has teeth.""
Jake groaned, burying his face in his hands. ""Em, please—""
""Don't 'Em, please' me,"" she snapped, marching closer. ""Do you know what it's like to stand in your own house, with your three-year-old, and hear the springs of your guest bed squeak to the beat of your midlife crisis?""
Ollie banged his fork again. ""Eep eep eep! Like dat, Mama!""
Emily gave him a fond smile. ""Exactly like that, bug.""
Jake dragged a hand down his face. ""I'll do anything, Em. I'll quit my job. Fire Melissa. Move out. Whatever you want.""
""Oh, now you want to negotiate?"" Emily folded her arms. ""Tell me, negotiator, were you this persuasive when you whispered sweet nothings into her overpriced hair extensions?""
Ollie perked up, eyes wide. ""Dada say Missa hair smell like strawberries an' sin!""
Jake's head shot toward his son. ""Oliver!""
But Ollie looked proud. ""I 'member! He say, 'Oh Missa, Memily hair smell like shampoo, but your hair smell like strawberries an' sin.'"" He wrinkled his nose. ""What's sin? Is it like ketchup?""
Emily almost doubled over laughing. ""Strawberries and sin? Oh, Jake. That's poetry. Did you get that off a Valentine's Day card at CVS?""
Jake's face burned crimson. ""It—it was stupid talk, Em. Just—just nothing words.""
""Nothing words?"" Emily repeated, voice sharp. ""So you risked our marriage, our family, for nothing words and a woman who apparently smells like fruit salad and damnation?""
Ollie pointed his fork. ""Dada, you silly.""
Emily turned back to the oven, sliding the tray inside. ""You're not staying here tonight. Or tomorrow. Or the next. You'll see Ollie every second day, and if you think for a second that woman is coming within five miles of my child, you're even dumber than your phone case.""
Jake winced. ""Em, please. I'll end it with her. I already—""
""Already what?"" Emily snapped. ""Already lied to me? Already promised me this was 'nothing'? Already used my guest room like a cheap motel?""
Ollie tapped his chin thoughtfully. ""Dada say Missa make him feel alive."" He tilted his head at Emily. ""Mama, Dada dead?""
Emily's lips twitched. ""Not yet, bug.""
Jake groaned. ""This isn't funny, Em.""
""Oh, it's hilarious,"" Emily shot back, eyes blazing. ""Because while you were out here writing discount Hallmark lines to your assistant, I was raising our child, paying our bills, and apparently doubling as frosting.""
The oven beeped.
""Nuggies!"" Ollie shouted, pumping his little fists.
Emily pulled the tray out, setting it on the counter. She placed nuggets and curly fries onto a plate shaped like a dinosaur and set it in front of her son. ""Here you go, bug.""
Ollie gasped. ""You da best, Mama. Nuggies for meeee."" He shoved one into his mouth, ketchup dripping down his chin.
Jake looked at the plate like it was a salvation he didn't deserve. ""Can I—""
Emily's glare froze him in place. ""You can't even look at these nuggets. These are Ollie's and mine. You? You're on a kale-and-regret diet until further notice.""
Ollie chewed thoughtfully, then pointed his nugget at Jake. ""No nuggies for Dada. Dada in da bin.""
Emily grinned, pecking the top of his head. ""Exactly.""
Jake's voice cracked. ""Em... what do I do? How do I fix this?""
Emily leaned on the counter, her voice calm, deadly. ""You don't fix it. Not with speeches. Not with balloons or karaoke or whatever half-baked romcom stunt you think will work. You fix yourself. You sit in your little hotel room, and you look in the mirror, and you figure out why you traded your family for strawberries and sin.""
Ollie held up his ketchup-smeared hand. ""Mama, can I have mo' fies?""
Emily handed him two more curly fries. ""Of course, bug.""
Then she looked back at Jake, her smile razor-sharp. ""And you? You can get out.""
Jake swallowed hard, nodding. ""Okay. Okay. I'll go. I'll call tomorrow, set up time with Ollie.""
""Through the shared calendar only,"" Emily snapped. ""If I get so much as one late-night 'miss you' text, I'll block your number faster than you can unzip your pants in my guest room.""
Ollie's head popped up. ""Unzip pants!"" He laughed hysterically, ketchup on his teeth. ""Dada go unzip, eep eep eep!"" He mimicked the bed squeaks again.
Emily covered her face, shoulders shaking with laughter she couldn't stop.
Jake, humiliated, picked up his jacket. ""I'll... I'll go.""
Emily wiped her eyes, still laughing. ""Good idea. And Jake?""
He turned, hopeful.
She raised her glass of water in a mock-toast. ""Enjoy your sin-scented solitude.""
The door shut behind him. Silence filled the kitchen except for the crunch of Ollie chewing.
""Mama,"" Ollie said solemnly, ketchup dripping. ""Memily don't need no sin hair.""
Emily smiled, tears in her eyes. ""You're right, bug. Memily doesn't.""
He held up a nugget. ""Memily just need nuggies.""
She clinked her fry against his nugget like it was a champagne glass. ""Cheers to that.""

The Marriott in Glendale wasn't what Jake Carter pictured when he imagined the glamorous life of adultery.
Scratch that—he hadn't really pictured this part at all. He'd imagined passion, escape, maybe even a second chance at youth. What he got was polyester sheets, stale hallway carpet, and a minibar that charged $6 for pretzels.
Jake sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the blinking voicemail light on his new burner phone. Melissa. Of course.
Babe, where are you? Call me. I miss you already.
Jake ran a hand through his hair. He'd told her to keep things quiet for a while, that he needed ""space."" What he meant was that Emily had kicked him out and he was now living on a diet of shame and vending machine Cheetos.
Meanwhile...
Back in Silver Lake, Emily and Ollie were sprawled on the couch with a bowl of popcorn between them. Ollie had crumbs in his curls and juice mustache stains on his shirt, but his grin was pure sunshine.
Emily flicked through Netflix. ""Bug, you want dinosaurs or superheroes?""
""Din'soooors!"" Ollie shouted, kicking his little legs. ""But afta din'soors, we eat nuggies 'gain.""
Emily snorted. ""You just had nuggets.""
He looked dead serious. ""Memily need nuggies fo' da soul.""
Her laugh cracked the tension still clinging to her chest. Ollie had that gift: turning misery into comedy without even knowing it. Everywhere she went lately, he came with her. The grocery store, Target, the bank. He was her sidekick, her sanity saver. If she had to face this betrayal, at least she didn't have to do it alone.
The phone buzzed on the coffee table. Emily froze when she saw Jake's name flash on the screen.
She picked up. ""Yes?""
On the other end, Jake's voice was low, tentative. ""Em... I'm at the Marriott. Just wanted you to know where I am. For Ollie's sake.""
""Great,"" she said flatly. ""Stay there. For Ollie's sake.""
""Can I—can I come by tomorrow? See him?""
""Schedule it on the calendar,"" Emily snapped. ""And Jake? If I see Melissa within a hundred feet of my house, I'll call the police and tell them you've got a neon-green burner phone labeled 'Work Hard, Play Harder.' I'm sure they'd find that charming.""
She hung up.
Ollie blinked up at her. ""Mama, was dat Dada?""
""Yes, bug.""
""What he say?""
""That he's in time-out,"" she said.
Ollie gasped, delighted. ""BIG boy time-out?!""
""The biggest.""
He nodded solemnly, then shoved popcorn into his mouth. ""Memily win.""
Emily pressed a peck to his hair. ""Memily always wins.""
⸻
The next afternoon, Jake showed up during his allotted time. He looked exhausted, his eyes bloodshot, his shirt creased like he'd slept in it. Emily let him in only because Ollie deserved a father, even if said father was a cheating idiot.
Ollie launched himself into Jake's arms. ""Dadaaa! Memily say you in BIG boy time-out!""
Jake grimaced. ""Yeah, buddy. Daddy made some mistakes.""
Ollie beamed, proud. ""Memily right! You say it onna phone. You say, 'Missa, Memily don't unnerstand me like you do.'""
Emily froze mid-step. She slowly turned, one brow arched. ""Oh, really?""
Jake's face drained of color. ""Ollie—buddy—that was just—""
But Ollie wasn't finished. ""An' you say, 'Missa, Memily too busy bein' Mama, but you make me feel... feel...'"" He squinted, searching for the word. ""'Feel alive!'""
Emily folded her arms, her smile sharp as a knife. ""Alive? Oh, well, thank God. For a second there I thought you were just in it for the strawberries-and-sin shampoo.""
Jake buried his face in his hands. ""Jesus Christ.""
""Don't swear in front of my child,"" Emily shot back.
Ollie tilted his head. ""Mama, Dada aliiiive, right?""
Emily's lips twitched. ""Not for long if he keeps talking.""
Jake groaned.
⸻
Later, as Jake sat awkwardly on the couch playing blocks with Ollie, Emily leaned in the doorway, arms crossed. She was still hurt—God, she was bleeding inside—but if she didn't laugh at the absurdity of it, she'd drown.
Ollie stacked blocks, then pointed at his dad. ""Dada, you no get nuggies.""
Jake looked crushed. ""Why not?""
""Cuz you in da bin.""
Emily couldn't help it. She laughed. Loud, real, cathartic. For the first time, Jake looked like he understood just how far gone he was.

The Carter family BBQ was always loud. Always crowded. Always full of laughter, ribs slathered in sauce, and Jake's mom trying to feed everyone until they burst.
This year? It was loud, crowded, and painfully awkward.
Emily stood by the grill with a plate of coleslaw, sunglasses on, hair tied up. She looked calm. In reality, she was a live grenade disguised as a PTA mom.
Ollie clung to her leg with one hand and gnawed on a chicken nugget she'd smuggled in her purse with the other. He didn't care about pulled pork or tri-tip. For Ollie, life was nuggets first, everything else second.
Jake hovered nearby, pale and twitchy, clutching a Solo cup like it might save him. He'd begged her to let him come, insisting ""It'll look worse if I don't show up."" Emily had agreed only because she wanted witnesses.
Jake's mother, Sandra Carter, bustled over with a tray of potato salad. ""Emily, honey! You look lovely. And Ollie—oh, come here, my little peanut!""
Ollie waddled over, cheeks full. ""Hi Gwamma!""
Sandra pecked his forehead. ""Have you been good for your mama?""
Ollie nodded enthusiastically. Then, in the way toddlers do, he immediately added: ""Dada was nakey wif Missa in da guest room.""
The entire patio froze.
Emily closed her eyes. There it is.
Sandra blinked. ""I'm sorry... what?""
Ollie, proud as a court stenographer, repeated: ""Dada nakey. In da guest bed. Wif Missa. He go eep eep eep!"" He demonstrated the squeaking sound with his little plastic fork against the picnic table. ""Like dat!""
A hush fell over the Carter family. Jake's brother dropped his beer. His sister's mouth fell open. Sandra's eyes widened like saucers.
Jake turned crimson. ""Ollie, buddy, no—""
But Ollie wasn't done. ""An' Dada say Missa smell like stwawbewwies an' sin! An' Memily just da fwostin'!""
Emily raised her plastic cup of lemonade in a silent toast. ""Cheers to frosting.""
Sandra gasped. ""Jake Alexander Carter! Are you having an affair?""
Jake sputtered. ""Mom, I—no—I mean—it was just—""
""Just WHAT?"" Sandra's voice cracked like a whip. ""Just undressed with your assistant in your guest room? Just humiliating your family in front of your child?""
Ollie licked ketchup from his fingers. ""Gwamma, Dada in BIG boy time-out.""
Sandra pressed a hand to her chest like she'd been shot. ""Good Lord.""
Jake groaned. ""Mom, please, not here—""
""Not here?"" Emily cut in, finally letting the smile stretch across her face. ""Where then, Jake? In my kitchen? In front of Ollie again? In the guest room with the world's squeakiest bedframe?""
Jake's sister snorted into her soda. His brother muttered, ""Jesus.""
Sandra shook her head, furious. ""You have a wife who stands by you, a son who adores you, and THIS is how you repay them? With some floozy at the office?""
""Her name is Melissa,"" Jake muttered, then immediately regretted it.
Sandra's nostrils flared. ""Don't you dare say her name at my table.""
Ollie banged his nugget box. ""No Missa! No pants! No prance!""
Half the family tried not to laugh. The other half looked horrified.
Emily patted Ollie's curls. ""You're absolutely right, bug.""
Jake buried his face in his hands. ""I can't believe this is happening.""
Emily leaned in, voice sweet as honey. ""Believe it, Jake. Because this is what happens when you underestimate me—and when you forget that toddlers hear everything.""
Ollie held up a nugget like a gavel. ""Dada in da bin.""
The table erupted—half laughter, half gasps.
Emily grinned, sipping her lemonade. For once, she didn't feel humiliated. She felt powerful.",1,1755849690.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1mx0f4q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mx0f4q,Customer story: “Wore my Tank dupe out… stranger complimented my taste 😂”,"Had to share this because it made my day.

One of our customers messaged us recently about his **AF Super Clone Tank Louis** (gold case, cream dial, black leather strap ). He said he wore it to a coffee shop and a random stranger leaned over and told him:

“Nice watch. You’ve got taste.”

He told us he almost laughed out loud because it wasn’t a “$10k Cartier Tank,” just the dupe he grabbed from us. What he liked most was:

The warm gold plating that doesn’t scream fake or overly shiny.

The cream dial with crisp Roman numerals and those blued hands that catch light at the right angle.

The slim profile that sits naturally on the wrist.

His words: *“Instead of feeling awkward wearing a dupe, I actually felt proud. It passed the vibe check.”*

We hear stories like this often, and honestly, they’re the best kind of feedback. It shows that a well-done piece isn’t about the logo on the dial—it’s about how it feels when you wear it.

Curious if anyone else here has had that “compliment from a stranger” moment while rocking a dupe?",2,1755849482.0,CartierReplicaWatches,1,1.0,False

1mx0b36,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1mx0b36/am_i_doing_something_wrong/,Am I doing something wrong?,"My little girl is 4 months old. I call her my HSB (highly sensitive baby) - she's a certified velcro baby, and I would say, has zero chill. She doesn't like being put down, to the point where baby massage/baby pilates classes have been, just, impossible. She just loves being held, and loves motion.

We learned pretty early on that the only way we could help her to nap was to put her in a carrier. We spent her first 7 weeks of life just taking it in turns walking around our country lanes, letting her sleep. If we tried the snoo, or even a still contact nap, she would just scream and scream her little lungs out.

Now, at 4 months old, I can still only get her to nap if I put her in the stretchy wrap and bounce gently on a yoga ball. If I try the snoo, it takes a lot of crying, soothing and at least 15 minutes, to get her to nap for one sleep cycle - about 30 minutes - and she wakes up really cranky. But if I just accept the carrier life, she can do 1.5 hours at a time, and she's just a much happier baby.

Am I making a big mistake by giving her all these carrier naps?

There's so much contradictory information out there about sleep training/bad habits/biologically normal sleep habits - it's extremely hard to know what to believe.

I am very lucky and have enough savings to take a year off work. I don't mind at all giving her the carrier naps, as it feels like it's what she needs. But of course, a little part of me is envious of my friends, whose babies can nap easily in the car/in the pram/stroller, who get to go out and socialise. I have tried and tried taking her out for coffee, lunch, etc. and it's just a stressful disaster. She gets really upset from the noise and mayhem around her. 

Has anyone else been in a similar position? Did your baby eventually grow out of needing carrier naps?

P.S. She is EBF, and we're lucky that she sleeps pretty well overnight, swaddled in the snoo (we haven't had success with arms out yet). She usually wakes up only once or twice for a feed, the rest of the time if she fusses I'll just pop her dummy/paci back in, and she'll usually go back to sleep.

So, when my boyfriend, Abel, suggested that I join him to visit his family on the island, I thought it was a great idea.  
  
This place is so much more than I expected. They even have a high school and a college here, which makes it even better.   
  
As we are about to start our freshman year of college, we thought this would be the best way to spend our vacation—on a beautiful, sunny beach that is surprisingly peaceful, considering how many people live here.   
  
Until now, with the boat over selling tickets we weren’t able to leave as planned. But I’m starting to think we’ve over stayed our welcome here anyway. I hadn’t really made an effort to get to know anyone while I’d been here all summer. It might be good to get back home and back into my normal routine again.  
  
But of course, there was the last party of the summer vacation on the last night, and Abel was the first to agree to go to it.  
  
I was never one to shy away from a party, but I always knew when enough was enough. I refuse to end up like my parents.  
  
We were sitting on the couch in the living room and I heard someone call Abel’s name in the distance and there was a group of people on the other side of the room waving at him, so he gave me a kiss on the cheek to go over and say a quick hello to them.   
  
I sat there for I don’t know how long and I was starting to get a little bored with this party. All I wanted to do was go back to Abel’s mother’s house and catch up on preparations for college. Even if we’re not there to start yet.  
  
I was just about to get up and go find Abel to tell him that I was leaving when his best friend from middle school, Dean, sat next to me and handed me a drink.  
  
“Dean, right?” I asked.   
  
“Yeah. We met the other day. Just briefly.” He said.   
  
“Right. Where’s Abel? Did you see where he went?” I asked.  
  
“I think he went to get another drink. And I thought now would be a good time for us to get to know each other.” He said.  
  
“Abel told me a fair bit about you two as kids.” I said.  
  
“Oh crap. I hope he didn’t tell you everything.” Dean said, shaking his head.   
  
“He told me enough to know that I need to watch out for you.” I smirked.  
  
“I can imagine. We were a nightmare for every adult responsible for us—parents and teachers alike,” Dean replied.  
  
“I've heard. Impressive,” I said.  
  
“I’ve heard some stories about you in high school as well. You weren’t the easiest kid on teachers.” Dean said.   
  
“What can I say? It made school more interesting.” I said.   
  
“Oh, yeah? I can’t wait to hear about the rest of the stories that you got up to. But aren’t you guys supposed to be starting college soon? Why are you still here?” Dean asked.  
  
“There was a mix-up with our tickets. Apparently, they overbooked the boat back, and now we have to wait for an opening. So, we’re not sure if we’re going to sign up for college here until we can get back home or not,” I explained.  
  
“That sucks. Boats aren’t very frequent around here—usually only every couple of weeks,” Dean replied.  
  
“I’ve been talking to them, and they told me there’s no guarantee. So I called the college here in town, and they said we can sign up here so we aren’t missing out on school, at least until we can get back home,” I explained.  
  
“Wow, very organized,” Dean said, raising his eyebrows.  
  
“Yeah. I guess so. We can’t really afford to sit around an island and do nothing.” I said.  
  
“Why don’t we go outside where it’s not so loud?” Dean suggested. So I looked around a bit and I couldn’t see Abel anywhere, so I agreed.  
  
We made our way through the house, which smelled of cigarettes, beer, and m\*\*\*\*\*\*\*a. As soon as we stepped outside, I lit up a cigarette as well.  
  
“So, how long have you two been together?” Dean asked.   
  
“Since sophomore year. So, almost three years,” I said.  
  
“Wow. That’s impressive for Abel,” Dean remarked.  
  
“I have a feeling there are a few stories he left out,” I commented.  
  
“I think that might have to be something that he tells you about. I might have just put my foot in it.” He said. But all I did was nod my head.  
  
He took a step closer to me. It felt a little uncomfortable, and I noticed he was more focused on my chest than my face, which was becoming quite obvious.  
  
The guy didn’t seem that drunk, so there was no excuse for his behavior. I wasn't wearing a bikini like many of the other girls at the party; I had on a tank top and denim shorts, which wasn’t revealing at all.  
  
“Hey, my eyes are up here,” I snapped at him.  
  
“Yeah, I know. I’m just surprised that Abel was able to catch a girl like you,” he said, stepping closer. I instinctively took a step back.  
  
I made it clear that he was being inappropriate and started looking around for someone else to talk to, hoping to find a way to escape. However, I didn’t really know anyone at the party.  
  
That’s when I spotted him—a guy leaning against the side of the house with a few friends around him, staring straight at me. I hadn't seen him all summer, and I couldn't help but wonder how that was even possible.  
  
He was tall and well-built, with tattoos covering his arms and neck. I could only imagine how many he had hidden beneath his clothes.   
  
I looked away, but I could still feel his eyes boring into the back of my head; he was still staring at me.   
  
Glancing back at the house, I noticed I couldn't see Abel. It shouldn't take him this long to get a drink, so I started walking toward the house, but Dean grabbed me by the arm.   
  
“Where are you going?” he asked.   
  
“I need to go to the bathroom. Is that alright with you?” I replied. Once I said that, he released me.   
  
I went back inside the house and headed to the kitchen, but Abel was nowhere to be found.   
  
I began walking down the hallway away from the kitchen in search of a bathroom when I opened one of the doors.   
  
That’s when I realized that I had walked into a bedroom and there were two people having s\*x on the bed.   
  
“Oh s\*\*t. Sorry.” I said, before I looked at them again. “Abel!” I yelled.   
  
In his naked sweaty mess, thrusting inside this other girl he didn't even realize someone opened the door. Not until I yelled his name.   
  
“Oh s\*\*t. Novalee, this isn’t what it looks like,” Abel tried to plead.   
  
“How the f\*\*k could I confuse this for anything else?” I yelled.   
  
“I thought she was you,” he defended.   
  
“I have blonde hair. She has black. Try again,” I remarked as the girl began getting dressed.   
  
“Maybe he just got tired of having s\*x with the same girl,” she taunted. My fists were clenched at my sides.   
  
“Macy, shut up,” Abel warned her. Macy? As in his ex-girlfriend? f\*\*k this s\*\*t.  
  
“What? Maybe she needs to hear it,” Macy said, putting her bra back on.   
  
I stood there, waiting for her to finish getting dressed before I walked over to her. I grabbed her by the hair and kicked her in the stomach, causing her to fall straight back through the closed window behind her.  
  


# CHAPTER 2

1394 WordsI turned around and stormed out of the room, with Abel chasing after me while trying to put on his clothes.   
  
I made my way outside, where Dean was standing near the same window from which the girl had been thrown. A few people were trying to help her, but she was lying on the ground, crying. Abel caught up to me and grabbed my arm.  
  
“Get the hell off me!” I shouted, struggling to break free from his grip.   
  
“It was an accident,” Abel insisted.   
  
“Wow. So, who threw her out the window?” Dean asked, drawing everyone’s attention.   
  
“She did. And where the hell were you?” Abel shot back at Dean.   
  
“Wait a minute! Dean was supposed to be distracting me while you were f\*\*\*\*\*g your ex?” I yelled.   
  
“It was his idea,” Dean said, quickly blaming his friend.  
  
“Don’t do it.” Abel pleaded. But I pulled my arm back and punch the unsuspecting Dean right in the face, making him fall backwards on the ground.   
  
“If you ever come near me again Abel, I will beat the living crap out of you. Now stay the f\*\*k away.” I yelled, storming off into the dark forest.   
  
I had to pass that same tattooed guy who was still watching every move I made, but this time, I only glanced at him as I walked by.  
  
I made it back to Abel's parents' house, and they were asleep, leaving a light on for us when we returned home. I quietly entered the bedroom, grabbed my suitcase, and started tossing all of my clothes into it. I needed to go to the bathroom to get my toiletries, and I placed them in my suitcase as well.  
  
“Novalee. Sweetie, what’s going on?” Abel’s mother, Rhea, asked as I was zipping up my suitcase.  
  
“Thank you so much for letting me stay here. I really appreciate it, and I like you and your family. But maybe you should talk to Abel about this,” I replied.  
  
She lowered her head, shaking it while pinching the bridge of her nose. “Was it Macy?” she asked, and I looked at her strangely. “Macy has always been a pain in my ass, ever since Abel started dating her and even after they broke up,” she explained.  
  
“Well, I guess Abel doesn’t have to tell you,” I said.  
  
“Where are you going to stay? You don’t even know when you can leave,” she said.  
  
“It’s fine. I’ll be okay. I can take care of myself,” I reassured her.  
  
“I can’t just let you leave without a plan,” she insisted.  
  
“Rhea, I really do appreciate everything you’ve done for me. But I can’t stay in the same house as him. I promise I’ll be alright,” I said. She then walked over and hugged me.  
  
“For what it’s worth, we were really hoping he wouldn’t f\*\*k things up with you. You seemed really good for him,” she said.  
  
“I appreciate that. I should go before he shows up. I might see you around,” I replied.  
  
“Alright. If you need anything, please don’t hesitate to call,” she said.  
  
I left the house with my suitcase and managed to get out without running into Abel. He was probably still at the party, trying to help Dean and Macy. But he should have known he was playing a dangerous game.  
  
I don't like to do it, but he knows that when I’m angry enough, I tend to lash out.  
  
I'm not proud of my actions, and I often feel ashamed the next day once I've calmed down. In the heat of the moment, however, I find it hard to control myself. I lash out, and for some reason, I have the strength to hurt others. I trained in kickboxing when I was younger, and even my instructors were impressed by my strength.  
  
It has been useful in the past when certain assholes have visited my parents, but I realize that I could probably address things differently.  
  
I walked around the dark island alone and made my way to a private beach where I knew no one lived. I didn’t really have anywhere to go, so I sat on the beach, lit a cigarette, and stared up at the stars.   
  
Suddenly, I heard something rustling in the forest behind me. I turned to look, but I couldn’t see anything; it was too dark. I assumed it was just an animal, so I lay down on the sand, using a couple of my clothes as a pillow.   
  
When I woke up the next morning, the sun was shining right in my face, waking me early. I got up and looked out at the ocean for a few minutes before grabbing my suitcase and heading back towards town.   
  
I knew the college would be open, so I snuck into the gym and went to the locker room for a shower. I changed into some fresh, clean clothes.   
  
As I was coming out of the locker room, I bumped into something hard. I looked up, and it was the same tattooed guy from the night before.   
  
“Sorry,” I said.  
  
He looked at me oddly before turning back to the locker room, where steam filled the air.   
  
“Did you just shower in there?” he asked.   
  
“What’s it to you?” I replied.   
  
“You were staying with Abel, weren’t you?” he pressed.   
  
“Maybe,” I said.   
  
“Where did you sleep last night?” he continued.   
  
“That’s none of your business. Do you always ask strangers this many questions?” I responded.   
  
“It’s a small island,” he said.   
  
“Apparently, not small enough,” I said, looking away.   
  
“You slept on the beach,” he stated.   
  
“I have to go,” I said, pushing past him and walking out of the gym.   
  
Not sure where to go, I wandered downtown and found a coffee shop that was open.   
  
I went inside and took a seat at a table, where I ordered a coffee.  
  
I looked at my phone, which I decided to turn on, and saw dozens of messages and missed calls from Abel. The town was small enough that I knew he would find me eventually, so I had to be careful about where I stayed. I didn’t want to see him because I was afraid I'd lose my temper again. There are only so many times I can do that before someone calls the cops on me and gets me arrested.   
  
Honestly, I’m surprised it hasn’t happened yet.  
  
I checked how much money I had, and I realized I only had enough to pay for this coffee. Once I finished, I left the café and headed to the park near the forest.   
  
By the time I arrived, storm clouds had started to roll in, and I couldn’t escape them. I tried to sit under a gazebo, but the wind was pushing the rain straight in at me.   
  
Feeling completely defeated, I sat there in the rain, staring off into space.   
  
“Didn’t your mother ever tell you that you’ll catch a cold if you stay out in the rain?” a guy asked. I turned around to find it was the same tattooed beauty from before.  
  
“Are you stalking me?” I asked.  
  
“I was walking by and saw you. And before you ask, I had football practice this morning, which is why I was heading to the locker room,” he said.    
  
“Congratulations,” I replied, looking away from him.  
  
“Come on, I’m not leaving you out here like this,” he insisted.    
  
“Where are we going?” I asked.    
  
“My house,” he said. I scoffed at the suggestion.    
  
“Dude, I don’t even know your name. Why would I go home with you?” I questioned.    
  
“It’s Adam. Come on, Novalee,” he said, picking up my suitcase for me.    
  
I stared at him for a moment, but eventually, I got up and started walking beside him toward a residential area near the forest, not close to the town.  
  


# CHAPTER 3

1438 WordsWhen we reached his neighborhood, I was really surprised. I hadn’t been to this part of the island all summer. For some reason, Abel never brought me here.  
  
We walked along the rows of houses on either side of the street. At the end of the street, there was a much larger house, but we stopped at the smaller one next door. It was really nice, though smaller than the house next to it. It had a couple of bedrooms and was very modern compared to some of the other houses I had seen in the area.  
  
The whole island had beautiful houses, but there were also some pretty old shacks.  
  
We walked inside, and Adam got me a towel to dry off.   
  
“Thank you,” I said.  
  
“So, what’s your plan now that you’re here?” he asked.  
  
“I don’t know. I don’t even have a ticket to get back home. I guess I’ll have to find a job and save up. Hopefully, I can go to school here while I’m doing that,” I replied.  
  
“You are planning on going to school. I overheard what you and Abel were saying to Dean last night,” he said.  
  
I paused what I was doing and looked at him quizzically. ""How? You were standing too far away, and the music was too loud. How could you possibly have heard that?"" I asked, feeling suspicious.  
  
""Well, I have really good hearing. Do you want something to eat?"" he replied, walking towards the kitchen.  
  
I didn’t answer but helped him pull food from the cupboards and fridge. I didn’t want to be a leech, so I joined him for lunch.   
  
As we ate, I noticed Adam staring at me intensely.   
  
“Why do you stare at me like that?” I asked.   
  
“I don’t know,” he replied, unembarrassed.   
  
“That’s a pretty shitty answer,” I said.   
  
“I can't explain it. There’s just something about you,” he insisted.   
  
“Sure you say that to all the girls, right?”   
  
“I’ve never said that to anyone,” he said, still serious.   
  
“Okay,” I replied, skeptical.  
  
“How did you learn to fight like that? You’re pretty strong,” he said.    
  
“Yeah, it happens when I lose my temper. I can't control it,” I replied. He nodded.    
  
“Where are you from?”    
  
“New Mexico.”    
  
“And that’s where you met Abel?” He asked.    
  
“Yeah, he was sent there to live with his dad because his mom had trouble with him,” I explained.    
  
“Are you going to college in New Mexico?”    
  
“Hell no. I got accepted to UCLA, and Abel applied too, not wanting a long-distance relationship,” I said, trying to suppress my emotions.    
  
He just sat there, listening. After eating, Adam showed me to the spare room for my suitcase. I took a warm shower to shake off the cold.    
  
After changing into shorts and a tank top, I returned to the living area.    
  
“Feeling better?” he asked.    
  
“Yeah, thanks,” I replied.    
  
Suddenly, I felt a little dizzy, but in a good way. Adam’s hot breath fanned my face, and my heart began to thump in my chest as if it were trying to break free.   
  
Adam’s large hand reached up, tracing his fingers down the side of my face, while his other arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me closer to his chest.   
  
He leaned down, and his mouth was against my neck, sending a shiver down my spine.  
  
“This could end up being a very bad idea,” Adam said.   
  
“Then maybe you shouldn’t have started it,” I replied, grabbing him by the neck and pulling his face to mine where our lips finally met.  
  
A soft moan left my lips and he pulled me closer against his chest as his tongue traced along my lip.   
  
I opened my mouth, granting his tongue entry as both of our tongues started dancing around each other.   
  
My legs started to get really weak as Adam deepened the kiss.   
  
I had to get on my tip toes so he wasn’t leaning down so far and I wrapped my arms around his neck. So he picked me up under my ass cheeks and I wrapped my legs around his waist. I heard a growl rumble in his chest, but I ignored it and didn’t think too much of it at the moment.   
  
He carried me to his bedroom but he pushed me against the wall while I   
  
was still in his arms, feeling the massive bulge in his pants as I was grinding against him.   
  
I moaned again, but this time it was more urgent. He turned around and laid me down on the bed.   
  
I knew this was a bad idea. But then Adam stood up and took off his shirt, revealing his tattooed, chiseled abs.   
  
Fuck it.  
  
He swiftly removed his pants as I leaned up and took off my shirt.  
  
He was definitely getting more aggressive, which I wasn’t arguing with. I reached down to grab the hem of my shorts and I managed to push them down and kick them off.   
  
Adam reached his other hand down between us and he rubbed my core and started rubbing my clit.   
  
“Oh, you’re so wet for me already.” He moaned.   
  
I felt my body react to every touch that he placed on me. No one had ever touched me like this before. Not even Abel.   
  
He was never dominant like Adam was right now.   
  
He grabbed his c\*\*k in that same hand as he leaned down kissing me again, and I couldn’t help but notice how big he was. He was definitely bigger than Abel. Actually, he was bigger than anyone I had ever slept with before.   
  
He started trailing kisses down my chest until he reached my breast and he started sucking on my n\*\*\*\*e before he moved to the other one and sucked on it for a breif moment.   
  
“Holy fuck.” He moaned in a harsher, raspier voice as he kissed back up my chest and along my shoulder to my neck and back to my lips where I wrapped my fingers in his hair. “You smell so damn good.”   
  
He pulled away from me once again, leaving me feeling empty and needing his touch.   
  
He reached over to the bedside table where I saw him grab a condom out and he ripped the packet and put it on.   
  
He then leaned back down over me and using his hand he slid his c\*\*k inside of me, causing me to gasp at the size.   
  
I wrapped my legs around my waist and I dug my nails into his back.   
  
“You are so f\*\*\*\*\*g tight.” He said, thrusting inside of me.   
  
He rested his head next to my neck and he took a deep breath, releasing another grumbling noise from his chest.   
  
“f\*\*k. Just like that.” I cried out as he was thrusting harder and faster inside of me.   
  
I couldn’t believe how good this was feeling. I had never felt like this with anyone before.   
  
I looked up at his face and for a brief moment, it looked like his eyes had changed color but then it was gone again.   
  
I must be hallucinating by the feelings that he was giving me.   
  
“c\*m for me, Lee.” He moaned, thrusting in faster and harder. Hitting the spot perfectly.   
  
He rolled over really suddenly so I was straddling him and I put my hands on his chest and as he was thrusting his hips upwards forcing himself further inside me, I was moving with him.   
  
I felt myself release all of it’s restraint and I fell over the edge of my orgasm, spilling my juices all over his c\*\*k.   
  
But he sat up so our chests were pressed against each other and he leaned his head on my shoulder as he was still thrusting inside of me.   
  
I felt something sharp on my neck. He was biting me in the crook of my neck.   
  
It hurt at first but it turned into pleasure as he was still f\*\*\*\*\*g me like an animal in heat.   
  
Then I realized that it was starting to hurt a lot more and I felt blood trickling down my back.   
  
I only just started to try and stop him when my vision started getting really blurring and I fell into the depth of darkness, falling unconscious.   
  


# CHAPTER 4

1171 WordsWhen I woke up, I found myself alone in bed. I reached over to check the clock and realized it was already the next morning. I wasn't entirely sure what had happened the night before, but it was definitely a good time.  
  
I got up, put my clothes back on, and left the bedroom. Noticing that Adam wasn't there, I figured he must have had football practice or something similar. Still, I wasn't naive—I knew how one-night stands typically went. So, I grabbed my bag from the other room and decided to leave before he returned.  
  
I wanted to avoid any awkwardness. He had kindly offered me a place to stay while it was raining, but with the sun shining now, I felt it was time to go.  
  
I walked into town and headed straight to the college. I found the office and talked to the same woman I had spoken to on the phone before.  
  
I had a brief meeting with her, and she was more than happy for me to start college on the island until I could return home—or at least until I could get to California.   
  
I didn’t really have plans to go back home right now; I felt like there was nothing for me there.   
  
She handed me my class schedule and mentioned that classes started today, urging me to attend. She noticed my suitcase and probably realized I was in a bit of a predicament, but I agreed to her suggestion.   
  
I assured her that I would indeed be attending the classes.   
  
After leaving the office, I found my way to my first class, which was quite straightforward and unremarkable. The professor outlined our plans for the semester and her expectations, which were simply to pay attention and complete the assignments—pretty self-explanatory. For the remainder of the lesson, we were allowed to go through our textbooks, which I had borrowed from the library.  
  
I used this time to focus on something far more important to me: I started looking for a job on the island. It was actually much bigger than people would think, and the town was filled with shops. Surprisingly, many of them were looking for workers.  
  
I applied to as many places as possible, then began searching for rentals. That turned out to be significantly more difficult.  
  
“Nice suitcase,” said a guy as he sat down next to me.  
  
“Thanks. I thought I could start a new trend,” I replied sarcastically, without looking up from my phone.  
  
“I take it you’re homeless,” he said, leaning over to glance at my phone. I turned to look at him.  
  
“Do you always invade people’s personal space like this?” I asked.  
  
“Only with the pretty ones,” he smirked, wiggling his eyebrows. “Damn. You might want to get that looked at,” he added.  
  
“What?” I asked.  
  
“That thing on your neck,” he replied. He pulled his phone out of his pocket, pressed a couple of buttons, and handed it to me. The camera was open, and when I looked at my neck, I initially thought it was a hickey, but it wasn’t—it was a bite. That bastard actually bit me! I thought I’d imagined it, but it looked pretty red at that moment. I knew I would have to keep it covered.  
  
“Yeah. I’ll do that,” I said, handing him his phone back.  
  
“Maybe you should see the nurse,” he suggested.  
  
“No, it’ll be alright. I’m sure it will go away,” I insisted.  
  
“Okay. I’m Colton,” he said.  
  
“Novalee,” I replied.  
  
“That’s a really pretty name,” he said, and I smiled at him. He actually seemed genuine, but I wasn’t going to fall for another pretty face right now—or ever again. I was done with pretty boys.  
  
I only had a couple of classes that day, so when I left campus, I started wandering around town, thinking about what I was going to do. I felt really stuck, and I hoped I wouldn’t run into Abel or Adam at that moment. I couldn’t face either of them.  
  
Adam would probably ignore me, and I could handle that. But Abel was the one I might lose my temper with, and I really didn’t want to end up hurting him. That was my biggest fear: losing my temper so badly that I could actually kill someone.  
  
I walked toward the forest, enjoying the feeling of freedom as I strolled among the trees, knowing that no one could see me there. I felt safer in the forest than I did in town.  
  
That’s when I saw it: a cabin in the middle of the forest. It looked like no one had lived there for a long time; it appeared to be abandoned.  
  
I managed to get the door open, and I was right: it was definitely abandoned. However, that meant there was no electricity and no water.   
  
I wasn't going to complain about it at the moment; I needed somewhere to stay, and I guess this would have to do. Honestly, I’ve stayed in worse places.   
  
After closing the door, I looked around at whatever was left behind, but I didn’t find anything useful. So, I cleaned out the cabin a bit to make it more bearable since I would be sleeping on the floor. However, I didn't go to too much trouble to get it clean—doing so would have been nearly impossible.   
  
My phone started ringing again, and when I saw Abel's name on the screen, I ignored it and let it go to voicemail.   
  
That first dark night in the cabin, I slept on the floor, listening to the distant howls of wolves. I had heard them ever since I came here, but I hadn’t actually seen any. Abel couldn’t explain how wolves ended up on the island, but people generally stayed away from them. As a result, the wolves didn’t venture too much into the forest.  
  
People are afraid of running into a wolf, so they tend to stay away. I was surprised to learn that no one had attempted to hunt and kill them. That's usually what Neanderthals do when they encounter something they dislike—they try to eliminate it.  
  
The next morning, I grabbed a smaller bag from my suitcase that I was using as a school bag and packed my books and clothes for the day. I left the cabin and walked to campus, where I took another shower in the locker room.  
  
I hoped not to run into Adam today since I was there later in the morning than yesterday. Fortunately, I didn't see him. As I walked across campus, I made sure my clothes looked clean and neat.  
  
""Novalee,"" someone said, grabbing my arm and spinning me around. When my eyes focused, I saw Abel standing in front of me.",1,1755848816.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1mx08ax,https://i.redd.it/h94efekpzikf1.jpeg,Why is it such a big deal in India if a teenager works in a café? Abroad it’s normal and alot of students from India work in fastfood chains as part time employees," Honestly, I’d love to spend a few hours working and making coffee every day. It would also give me a little extra pocket money to buy stuff I can’t ask my parents for. It’s high time we normalise this in India.

I’ve seen the neighbor a few times and exchanged pleasantries. She asked me what I was doing and I showed her the floor I was working on and apologized for the noise etc. 

So a few days into the project I see her and she said she tried to knock to invite me to a have a coffee. I explained that with headphones in, earmuffs on, the vacuum on and running the orbital sander I didn’t hear the knock but a coffee would be nice sometime so I gave her my number so she could text me and I would hear the beep in my ears. She says well hey why don’t you come over for lunch tomorrow and I say cool, we set a time and I go back to work.

I saw her the next day in the morning as I was heading in and she asked me what I brought for lunch? I kinda lied and said I was planning on running to the store later to grab something but honestly I had kind of assumed she would be providing the lunch haha. Obviously not expecting some lavish meal but a piece of bread and cheese? Idk I’m not from the Netherlands originally but if you invite someone to your home for a meal are they supposed to bring their own food?

Was I rude? I have never had this experience and would rather not repeat it in the future lol",42,1755848694.0,Netherlands,36,1.0,False

Anyone has a link to read this story online for free?,"Coming to this island seemed like a good idea at the time. It meant I wouldn’t have to return home and take care of my parents during my summer vacation while they were too wasted to even get out of bed, except when they needed to find their next fix. So, when my boyfriend, Abel, suggested that I join him to visit his family on the island, I thought it was a great idea.  
  
This place is so much more than I expected. They even have a high school and a college here, which makes it even better.  
  
As we are about to start our freshman year of college, we thought this would be the best way to spend our vacation—on a beautiful, sunny beach that is surprisingly peaceful, considering how many people live here.  
  
Until now, with the boat over selling tickets we weren’t able to leave as planned. But I’m starting to think we’ve over stayed our welcome here anyway. I hadn’t really made an effort to get to know anyone while I’d been here all summer. It might be good to get back home and back into my normal routine again.  
  
But of course, there was the last party of the summer vacation on the last night, and Abel was the first to agree to go to it.  
  
I was never one to shy away from a party, but I always knew when enough was enough. I refuse to end up like my parents.  
  
We were sitting on the couch in the living room and I heard someone call Abel’s name in the distance and there was a group of people on the other side of the room waving at him, so he gave me a kiss on the cheek to go over and say a quick hello to them.  
  
I sat there for I don’t know how long and I was starting to get a little bored with this party. All I wanted to do was go back to Abel’s mother’s house and catch up on preparations for college. Even if we’re not there to start yet.  
  
I was just about to get up and go find Abel to tell him that I was leaving when his best friend from middle school, Dean, sat next to me and handed me a drink.  
  
“Dean, right?” I asked.  
  
“Yeah. We met the other day. Just briefly.” He said.  
  
“Right. Where’s Abel? Did you see where he went?” I asked.  
  
“I think he went to get another drink. And I thought now would be a good time for us to get to know each other.” He said.  
  
“Abel told me a fair bit about you two as kids.” I said.  
  
“Oh cra'ap. I hope he didn’t tell you everything.” Dean said, shaking his head.  
  
“He told me enough to know that I need to watch out for you.” I smirked.  
  
“I can imagine. We were a nightmare for every adult responsible for us—parents and teachers alike,” Dean replied.  
  
“I've heard. Impressive,” I said.  
  
“I’ve heard some stories about you in high school as well. You weren’t the easiest kid on teachers.” Dean said.  
  
“What can I say? It made school more interesting.” I said.  
  
“Oh, yeah? I can’t wait to hear about the rest of the stories that you got up to. But aren’t you guys supposed to be starting college soon? Why are you still here?” Dean asked.  
  
“There was a mix-up with our tickets. Apparently, they overbooked the boat back, and now we have to wait for an opening. So, we’re not sure if we’re going to sign up for college here until we can get back home or not,” I explained.  
  
“That suks. Boats aren’t very frequent around here—usually only every couple of weeks,” Dean replied.  
  
“I’ve been talking to them, and they told me there’s no guarantee. So I called the college here in town, and they said we can sign up here so we aren’t missing out on school, at least until we can get back home,” I explained.  
  
“Wow, very organized,” Dean said, raising his eyebrows.  
  
“Yeah. I guess so. We can’t really afford to sit around an island and do nothing.” I said.  
  
“Why don’t we go outside where it’s not so loud?” Dean suggested. So I looked around a bit and I couldn’t see Abel anywhere, so I agreed.  
  
We made our way through the house, which smelled of cigarettes, beer, and mа'rijuаnа. As soon as we stepped outside, I lit up a cigarette as well.  
  
“So, how long have you two been together?” Dean asked.  
  
“Since sophomore year. So, almost three years,” I said.  
  
“Wow. That’s impressive for Abel,” Dean remarked.  
  
“I have a feeling there are a few stories he left out,” I commented.  
  
“I think that might have to be something that he tells you about. I might have just put my foot in it.” He said. But all I did was nod my head.  
  
He took a step closer to me. It felt a little uncomfortable, and I noticed he was more focused on my chest than my face, which was becoming quite obvious.  
  
The guy didn’t seem that drunk, so there was no excuse for his behavior. I wasn't wearing a bikini like many of the other girls at the party; I had on a tank top and denim shorts, which wasn’t revealing at all.  
  
“Hey, my eyes are up here,” I snapped at him.  
  
“Yeah, I know. I’m just surprised that Abel was able to catch a girl like you,” he said, stepping closer. I instinctively took a step back.  
  
I made it clear that he was being inappropriate and started looking around for someone else to talk to, hoping to find a way to escape. However, I didn’t really know anyone at the party.  
  
That’s when I spotted him—a guy leaning against the side of the house with a few friends around him, staring straight at me. I hadn't seen him all summer, and I couldn't help but wonder how that was even possible.  
  
He was tall and well-built, with tattoos covering his arms and neck. I could only imagine how many he had hidden beneath his clothes.  
  
I looked away, but I could still feel his eyes boring into the back of my head; he was still staring at me.  
  
Glancing back at the house, I noticed I couldn't see Abel. It shouldn't take him this long to get a drink, so I started walking toward the house, but Dean grabbed me by the arm.  
  
“Where are you going?” he asked.  
  
“I need to go to the bathroom. Is that alright with you?” I replied. Once I said that, he released me.  
  
I went back inside the house and headed to the kitchen, but Abel was nowhere to be found.  
  
I began walking down the hallway away from the kitchen in search of a bathroom when I opened one of the doors.  
  
That’s when I realized that I had walked into a bedroom and there were two people hаving sx on the bed.   
  
“Oh sh1t. Sorry.” I said, before I looked at them again. “Abel!” I yelled.  
  
In his n8ked sweaty mess, thrvsting inside this other girl he didn't even realize someone opened the door. Not until I yelled his name.  
  
“Oh sh1t. Novalee, this isn’t what it looks like,” Abel tried to plead.  
  
“How the fck could I confuse this for anything else?” I yelled.  
  
“I thought she was you,” he defended.  
  
“I have blonde hair. She has black. Try again,” I remarked as the girl began getting dressed.  
  
“Maybe he just got tired of hаving sx with the same girl,” she taunted. My fists were clenched at my sides.   
  
“Macy, shut up,” Abel warned her. Macy? As in his ex-girlfriend? F'ck this shlt.  
  
“What? Maybe she needs to hear it,” Macy said, putting her bra back on.  
  
I stood there, waiting for her to finish getting dressed before I walked over to her. I grabbed her by the hair and kicked her in the stomach, causing her to fall straight back through the closed window behind her.  
  
  
  
I turned around and stormed out of the room, with Abel chasing after me while trying to put on his clothes.  
  
I made my way outside, where Dean was standing near the same window from which the girl had been thrown. A few people were trying to help her, but she was lying on the ground, crying. Abel caught up to me and grabbed my arm.  
  
“Get off me!” I shouted, struggling to break free from his grip.  
  
“It was an accident,” Abel insisted.  
  
“Wow. So, who threw her out the window?” Dean asked, drawing everyone’s attention.  
  
“She did. And where the hll were you?” Abel shot back at Dean.  
  
“Wait a minute! Dean was supposed to be distracting me while you were fkn your ex?” I yelled.  
  
“It was his idea,” Dean said, quickly blaming his friend.  
  
“Don’t do it.” Abel pleaded. But I pulled my arm back and punch the unsuspecting Dean right in the face, making him fall backwards on the ground.  
  
“If you ever come near me again Abel, I will beat the living cra'ap out of you. Now stay the hll away.” I yelled, storming off into the dark forest.   
  
I had to pass that same tattooed guy who was still watching every move I made, but this time, I only glanced at him as I walked by.  
  
I made it back to Abel's parents' house, and they were asleep, leaving a light on for us when we returned home. I quietly entered the bedroom, grabbed my suitcase, and started tossing all of my clothes into it. I needed to go to the bathroom to get my toiletries, and I placed them in my suitcase as well.  
  
“Novalee. Sweetie, what’s going on?” Abel’s mother, Rhea, asked as I was zipping up my suitcase.  
  
“Thank you so much for letting me stay here. I really appreciate it, and I like you and your family. But maybe you should talk to Abel about this,” I replied.  
  
She lowered her head, shaking it while pinching the bridge of her nose. “Was it Macy?” she asked, and I looked at her strangely. “Macy has always been a pain in my as, ever since Abel started dating her and even after they broke up,” she explained.  
  
“Well, I guess Abel doesn’t have to tell you,” I said.  
  
“Where are you going to stay? You don’t even know when you can leave,” she said.  
  
“It’s fine. I’ll be okay. I can take care of myself,” I reassured her.  
  
“I can’t just let you leave without a plan,” she insisted.  
  
“Rhea, I really do appreciate everything you’ve done for me. But I can’t stay in the same house as him. I promise I’ll be alright,” I said. She then walked over and hugged me.  
  
“For what it’s worth, we were really hoping he wouldn’t f'k things up with you. You seemed really good for him,” she said.  
  
“I appreciate that. I should go before he shows up. I might see you around,” I replied.  
  
“Alright. If you need anything, please don’t hesitate to call,” she said.  
  
I left the house with my suitcase and managed to get out without running into Abel. He was probably still at the party, trying to help Dean and Macy. But he should have known he was playing a dangerous game.  
  
I don't like to do it, but he knows that when I’m angry enough, I tend to lash out.  
  
I'm not proud of my actions, and I often feel ashamed the next day once I've calmed down. In the heat of the moment, however, I find it hard to control myself. I lash out, and for some reason, I have the strength to hurt others. I trained in kickboxing when I was younger, and even my instructors were impressed by my strength.  
  
It has been useful in the past when certain аsholes have visited my parents, but I realize that I could probably address things differently.  
  
I walked around the dark island alone and made my way to a private beach where I knew no one lived. I didn’t really have anywhere to go, so I sat on the beach, lit a cigarette, and stared up at the stars.  
  
Suddenly, I heard something rustling in the forest behind me. I turned to look, but I couldn’t see anything; it was too dark. I assumed it was just an animal, so I lay down on the sand, using a couple of my clothes as a pillow.  
  
When I woke up the next morning, the sun was shining right in my face, waking me early. I got up and looked out at the ocean for a few minutes before grabbing my suitcase and heading back towards town.  
  
I knew the college would be open, so I snuck into the gym and went to the locker room for a shower. I changed into some fresh, clean clothes.  
  
As I was coming out of the locker room, I bumped into something hard. I looked up, and it was the same tattooed guy from the night before.  
  
“Sorry,” I said.  
  
He looked at me oddly before turning back to the locker room, where steam filled the air.  
  
“Did you just shower in there?” he asked.  
  
“What’s it to you?” I replied.  
  
“You were staying with Abel, weren’t you?” he pressed.  
  
“Maybe,” I said.  
  
“Where did you sleep last night?” he continued.  
  
“That’s none of your business. Do you always ask strangers this many questions?” I responded.  
  
“It’s a small island,” he said.  
  
“Apparently, not small enough,” I said, looking away.  
  
“You slept on the beach,” he stated.  
  
“I have to go,” I said, pushing past him and walking out of the gym.  
  
Not sure where to go, I wandered downtown and found a coffee shop that was open.  
  
I went inside and took a seat at a table, where I ordered a coffee.  
  
I looked at my phone, which I decided to turn on, and saw dozens of messages and missed calls from Abel. The town was small enough that I knew he would find me eventually, so I had to be careful about where I stayed. I didn’t want to see him because I was afraid I'd lose my temper again. There are only so many times I can do that before someone calls the cops on me and gets me arrested.  
  
Honestly, I’m surprised it hasn’t happened yet.  
  
I checked how much money I had, and I realized I only had enough to pay for this coffee. Once I finished, I left the café and headed to the park near the forest.  
  
By the time I arrived, storm clouds had started to roll in, and I couldn’t escape them. I tried to sit under a gazebo, but the wind was pushing the rain straight in at me.  
  
Feeling completely defeated, I sat there in the rain, staring off into space.  
  
“Didn’t your mother ever tell you that you’ll catch a cold if you stay out in the rain?” a guy asked. I turned around to find it was the same tattooed beauty from before.  
  
“Are you stalking me?” I asked.  
  
“I was walking by and saw you. And before you ask, I had football practice this morning, which is why I was heading to the locker room,” he said.  
  
“Congratulations,” I replied, looking away from him.  
  
“Come on, I’m not leaving you out here like this,” he insisted.  
  
“Where are we going?” I asked.  
  
“My house,” he said. I scoffed at the suggestion.  
  
“Dude, I don’t even know your name. Why would I go home with you?” I questioned.  
  
“It’s Adam. Come on, Novalee,” he said, picking up my suitcase for me.  
  
I stared at him for a moment, but eventually, I got up and started walking beside him toward a residential area near the forest, not close to the town.  
  
  
  
When we reached his neighborhood, I was really surprised. I hadn’t been to this part of the island all summer. For some reason, Abel never brought me here.  
  
We walked along the rows of houses on either side of the street. At the end of the street, there was a much larger house, but we stopped at the smaller one next door. It was really nice, though smaller than the house next to it. It had a couple of bedrooms and was very modern compared to some of the other houses I had seen in the area.  
  
The whole island had beautiful houses, but there were also some pretty old shacks.  
  
We walked inside, and Adam got me a towel to dry off.  
  
“Thank you,” I said.  
  
“So, what’s your plan now that you’re here?” he asked.  
  
“I don’t know. I don’t even have a ticket to get back home. I guess I’ll have to find a job and save up. Hopefully, I can go to school here while I’m doing that,” I replied.  
  
“You are planning on going to school. I overheard what you and Abel were saying to Dean last night,” he said.  
  
I paused what I was doing and looked at him quizzically. ""How? You were standing too far away, and the music was too loud. How could you possibly have heard that?"" I asked, feeling suspicious.  
  
""Well, I have really good hearing. Do you want something to eat?"" he replied, walking towards the kitchen.  
  
I didn’t answer but helped him pull food from the cupboards and fridge. I didn’t want to be a leech, so I joined him for lunch.  
  
As we ate, I noticed Adam staring at me intensely.  
  
“Why do you stare at me like that?” I asked.  
  
“I don’t know,” he replied, unembarrassed.  
  
“That’s a pretty bаd answer,” I said.  
  
“I can't explain it. There’s just something about you,” he insisted.  
  
“Sure you say that to all the girls, right?”  
  
“I’ve never said that to anyone,” he said, still serious.  
  
“Okay,” I replied, skeptical.  
  
“How did you learn to fight like that? You’re pretty strong,” he said.  
  
“Yeah, it happens when I lose my temper. I can't control it,” I replied. He nodded.  
  
“Where are you from?”  
  
“New Mexico.”  
  
“And that’s where you met Abel?” He asked.  
  
“Yeah, he was sent there to live with his dad because his mom had trouble with him,” I explained.  
  
“Are you going to college in New Mexico?”  
  
“Hll no. I got accepted to UCLA, and Abel applied too, not wanting a long-distance relationship,” I said, trying to suppress my emotions.  
  
He just sat there, listening. After eating, Adam showed me to the spare room for my suitcase. I took a warm shower to shake off the cold.  
  
After changing into shorts and a tank top, I returned to the living area.  
  
“Feeling better?” he asked.  
  
“Yeah, thanks,” I replied.  
  
Suddenly, I felt a little dizzy, but in a good way. Adam’s hot breath fanned my face, and my heart began to thump in my chest as if it were trying to break free.  
  
Adam’s large hand reached up, tracing his fingers down the side of my face, while his other arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me closer to his chest.  
  
He leaned down, and his mouth was against my neck, sending a shiver down my spine.  
  
“This could end up being a very bad idea,” Adam said.  
  
“Then maybe you shouldn’t have started it,” I replied, grabbing him by the neck and pulling his face to mine where our lips finally met.  
  
A soft moan left my lips and he pulled me closer against his chest as his tongue traced along my lip.  
  
I opened my mouth, granting his tongue entry as both of our tongues started dancing around each other.  
  
My legs started to get really weak as Adam deepened the kiss.  
  
I had to get on my tip toes so he wasn’t leaning down so far and I wrapped my arms around his neck. So he picked me up under my a'ss cheeks and I wrapped my legs around his waist. I heard a growl rumble in his chest, but I ignored it and didn’t think too much of it at the moment.   
  
He carried me to his bedroom but he pushed me against the wall while I  
  
was still in his arms, feeling the massive bulge in his pants as I was grinding against him.  
  
I moaned again, but this time it was more urgent. He turned around and laid me down on the bed.  
  
I knew this was a bad idea. But then Adam stood up and took off his shirt, revealing his tattooed, chiseled abs.  
  
F'k it.  
  
He swiftly removed his pants as I leaned up and took off my shirt.  
  
He was definitely getting more aggressive, which I wasn’t arguing with. I reached down to grab the hem of my shorts and I managed to push them down and kick them off.  
  
Adam reached his other hand down between us and he rubbed my core and started rubbing my cl1t.  
  
“Oh, you’re so wet for me already.” He moaned.  
  
I felt my body react to every touch that he placed on me. No one had ever touched me like this before. Not even Abel.  
  
He was never dominant like Adam was right now.  
  
He grabbed his stick in that same hand as he leaned down kissing me again, and I couldn’t help but notice how big he was. He was definitely bigger than Abel. Actually, he was bigger than anyone I had ever slept with before.  
  
He started trailing kisses down my chest until he reached my brest and he started suking on my nut before he moved to the other one and suked on it for a breif moment.  
  
“Holy f'k.” He moaned in a harsher, raspier voice as he kissed back up my chest and along my shoulder to my neck and back to my lips where I wrapped my fingers in his hair. “You smell so dam good.”   
  
He pulled away from me once again, leaving me feeling empty and needing his touch.  
  
He reached over to the bedside table where I saw him grab a protection out and he ripped the packet and put it on.  
  
He then leaned back down over me and using his hand he slid his cok inside of me, causing me to gasp at the size.   
  
I wrapped my legs around my waist and I dug my nails into his back.  
  
“You are so fkn tight.” He said, thrvsting inside of me.  
  
He rested his head next to my neck and he took a deep breath, releasing another grumbling noise from his chest.  
  
“F'k. Just like that.” I cried out as he was thrvsting harder and faster inside of me.   
  
I couldn’t believe how good this was feeling. I had never felt like this with anyone before.  
  
I looked up at his face and for a brief moment, it looked like his eyes had changed color but then it was gone again.  
  
I must be hallucinating by the feelings that he was giving me.  
  
“Cvm for me, Lee.” He moaned, thrvsting in faster and harder. Hitting the spot perfectly.  
  
He rolled over really suddenly so I was straddling him and I put my hands on his chest and as he was thrvsting his hips upwards forcing himself further inside me, I was moving with him.  
  
I felt myself release all of it’s restraint and I fell over the edge of my or'gаsm, spilling my juices all over his cok.   
  
But he sat up so our chests were pressed against each other and he leaned his head on my shoulder as he was still thrvsting inside of me.  
  
I felt something sharp on my neck. He was biting me in the crook of my neck.  
  
It hurt at first but it turned into pleasure as he was still fking me like an animal in heat.  
  
Then I realized that it was starting to hurt a lot more and I felt blood trickling down my back.  
  
I only just started to try and stop him when my vision started getting really blurring and I fell into the depth of darkness, falling unconscious.  
  
  
  
When I woke up, I found myself alone in bed. I reached over to check the clock and realized it was already the next morning. I wasn't entirely sure what had happened the night before, but it was definitely a good time.  
  
I got up, put my clothes back on, and left the bedroom. Noticing that Adam wasn't there, I figured he must have had football practice or something similar. Still, I wasn't naive—I knew how one-night stands typically went. So, I grabbed my bag from the other room and decided to leave before he returned.  
  
I wanted to avoid any awkwardness. He had kindly offered me a place to stay while it was raining, but with the sun shining now, I felt it was time to go.  
  
I walked into town and headed straight to the college. I found the office and talked to the same woman I had spoken to on the phone before.  
  
I had a brief meeting with her, and she was more than happy for me to start college on the island until I could return home—or at least until I could get to California.  
  
I didn’t really have plans to go back home right now; I felt like there was nothing for me there.  
  
She handed me my class schedule and mentioned that classes started today, urging me to attend. She noticed my suitcase and probably realized I was in a bit of a predicament, but I agreed to her suggestion.  
  
I assured her that I would indeed be attending the classes.

Anyone can tell me where I can read this story for free?,"I try seducing my fiance, Vernon Floyd, 999 times. But even when I'm shirtless, his only concern is whether I'm cold.

I assume that Vernon is a traditional guy, who wants to do it until we're married. But on the day of our anniversary, I discover that he has secretly booked a hotel famous for couples' getaways in the city.

That night, I arrive at the VIP suite full of hope. In the end, all I see is Vernon and his childhood sweetheart passionately kissing each other as the crowd cheers.

I wait outside the VIP suite for a long time. Finally, I understand that he doesn't love me.

After leaving the hotel, I call my family. ""Dad, I don't want to marry Vernon anymore. I want to marry Dylan instead!""

Dad spits out his coffee and says, ""Avril, Mr. Walker got into a car accident a few years ago. I heard that he's impotent. If you marry him, you won't have any children!""

By then, I am already disheartened. ""It doesn't matter whether I have children or not.""

Chapter 1

As soon as Mom heard what I said, she quickly snatched the phone from Dad and asked, ""Avril, you've always loved kids. What happened today?""

Mom knew I always donated books and toys to the orphanage every year. It was obvious that I adored children.

Then, Mom said to me in a low voice, ""That Mr. Walker is known to be injured from the waist down. He might be impotent.

""All these years, not a single young woman was willing to marry him! Besides, Mr. Walker did propose to you several times. You kept refusing him, didn't you?""

After hearing what Mom said, I looked at a photo in my phone gallery. Dylan Walker was a handsome young man with broad shoulders and long legs.

I already thought about it. Despite Dylan's good looks, he was most likely impotent. However, marrying him was much better than spending the rest of my life with Vernon Floyd, who still had feelings for his childhood sweetheart.

A knife seemed to pierce through my heart as I recalled everything I heard for half the night.

Dad realized my tone sounded off and asked cautiously, ""When will you break up with that prude boyfriend of yours? Once that is done, then we'll set up a meeting with Mr. Walker.""

""Let's meet in three days. Once I've handled things on my side, I'll return immediately for my engagement to Mr. Walker.""

After leaving the hotel, I returned to the apartment I had shared with Vernon for the past six years.

I recalled how I met Vernon's gaze across the crowd before. Although he seemed a little surprised to see me there, he merely frowned before leading the young woman to their seats.

There were roses, champagne, a piano melody from a love song, and a romantic candlelit dinner for two. Over the past six years of being with Vernon, I never once had dinner with him at a place like this.

As I turned to leave, I realized Vernon's good friends were there as well. One of them had posted the news of Vernon's reservation at the hotel for couples' getaways on Instagram.

Before leaving, I even heard them wolf-whistling and applauding. ""Indeed, you two are a perfect match. After so many years, you guys have finally made it official!""

""Come on! Let's raise our glasses and wish this happy couple a happy ending!""

I smiled bitterly to myself. For the past six years, I had always been by Vernon's side. His good friends knew everything about Vernon and his childhood sweetheart but had no idea of my relationship with him.

A bitter feeling rose within my heart.

Today was my sixth anniversary with Vernon. When I found out about his reservation at that hotel, I knew I was ready to take the next step in our relationship.

But now, the joy had turned into a bitterness that consumed me from inside out.

Once I was home, a delivery man brought an anniversary cake—right at midnight. On the box was a card with Vernon's handwriting.

""From now on, I hope you'll be by my side every day.""

The delivery man shot me an envious smile. ""Miss, your boyfriend's really good to you. He ordered the most luxurious cake from our shop and even requested that we deliver it on time. He even personally wrote that note on the box!""

I opened the door and took the cake from the delivery man. Then, I casually set it on the table.

So, Vernon still remembered that today was our sixth anniversary. But what did he do tonight?

I slumped weakly against the couch and stared at the empty room before me. I couldn't help but tear up.

The room was filled with traces of our life together. Yet Vernon had booked a hotel room and slept with another woman for the night.

Looking at the cake made me disgusted. All I wanted to do was throw up.

I sat on the couch for a long time and lost track of time.

Suddenly, the apartment door opened.

Chapter 2

Vernon had returned, looking exhausted. He was even holding a bouquet of fresh flowers. He walked toward me with no trace of guilt or remorse.

""Avril, I brought you your favorite roses.""

Red roses represented sincere and passionate love. Right now, those flowers looked like a joke in Vernon's hands.

I accepted the roses. Thinking that I was no longer angry, Vernon began to explain. ""It's Peggy Cahill. She's been diagnosed with bone cancer. All she wants is to marry me.

""Since I grew up with her, there's no way I'd let her down. We're getting engaged in three days. You've always been considerate. You understand why I'm doing this, right?""

From Vernon's tone, it didn't sound like he was explaining himself. It was more like he was informing me of his decision to get engaged with Peggy Cahill.

What a coincidence. I would be leaving in three days too.

I nodded in silence. In the past, Vernon could never stand how emotionally sensitive I was. He said I always sought reassurance from him whenever there was a minor issue. I would keep asking him whether he loved me.

Eventually, I got rid of that attitude and also learned how to be patient.

I didn't make a fuss, nor did I keep asking Vernon whether he still loved me. Vernon cast me a glance, looking somewhat startled.

""I'll be moving in with Peggy tomorrow. For the next few months, you might have to put up with being alone. Peggy's a patient. Compared to you, she needs my company more than ever.""

I set the roses down with a smile. Seeing that I hadn't objected to his decision, Vernon approached me, wanting to caress my face.

In the past, Vernon never took the initiative to touch me. But this time, I subtly moved away from him.

A clear lipstick mark was visible on the collar of his shirt. The sickly sweet smell of perfume on him drifted into my nostrils, making me feel like I was about to throw up.

Vernon became furious, knowing that he had been rejected. Without a word, he quickly left the apartment.

I tossed the roses and cake into the rubbish bin. Then, I started packing my things.

I didn't want those flowers. I no longer wanted Vernon in my life either. As for the apartment where I had lived for six years, I was no longer attached to it.

Chapter 3

The next day, I returned to the office. I was at my desk, holding the resignation letter I printed.

I had gotten to know Vernon at college, and that was where we fell in love too. After he got a job at this tech company, I followed him there as well. I rejected any plans Mom and Dad had made for me and started out in an entry-level position at the company.

After getting together with Vernon, I did everything I could to tease him. However, it didn't matter if I wore something revealing, pretended to have fallen into his lap by accident, or tried to kiss him while I was drunk.

As long as we crossed the line, Vernon would fiddle with the rosary beads around his wrist. Then, he would look at me calmly with restraint. He seemed like a man with no desires—a saint who accidentally ended up in the human world.

It had been six years since we got together. From the moment I learned that Vernon had made a reservation at the hotel, I was filled with hope, thinking that he was ready to take things to the next level.

In the end, it was just my wishful thinking.

A colleague nearby walked toward me. Once she noticed the resignation letter on my laptop, she was slightly taken aback.

""Avril, you'll be promoted to director soon. Why are you resigning all of a sudden?""

I smiled. ""I'm getting married soon. When the time comes, I'll get a new job.""

My colleague, Lisa Fisher, congratulated me with a smile. ""Lately, everyone at the office seems to be getting married. Last night, I saw Mr. Floyd's Instagram post. He's getting engaged!

""It's no surprise that Mr. Floyd and his girlfriend are a perfect match. I heard they're childhood sweethearts.

""Back then, I was wondering who could ever melt his heart. He's so stoic! Now, I know better. It could only be his first love!""

Suddenly, I found it hard to smile. I checked my phone and realized that Vernon had blocked me on his main and alternate Instagram account.

Vernon's main account was for personal use. After he left the apartment last night, he blocked me on Instagram right away.

On the other hand, Vernon's alternate account was used for work, and all of our conversations there were purely professional.

At that moment, Vernon led Peggy into the office. Peggy's face was glowing, and a radiant smile played on her lips. She didn't look like someone who was supposed to be sick.

Vernon began introducing Peggy to everyone in the office. ""She's our new Technical Director, Peggy Cahill. Let's welcome her. You'll be working closely together in the future.""

Lisa looked startled. Her gaze shifted between me and Peggy. Finally, she greeted Peggy, saying, ""Hello, Ms. Cahill!""

I said nothing as I tightened my grip on the resignation letter.

But Vernon stared at me with displeasure. ""Avril, everyone's already greeted the new director. What's this behavior?""

Peggy chuckled before extending her hand to me. ""We'll be working closely in the future. Let's support each other.""

As soon as I reached out to shake her hand, Vernon pulled Peggy's hand back. ""You're a director, so there's no need for you to be so polite with these entry-level employees. Come on. I'll show you around so you can get acquainted.""

Vernon and Peggy walked away, leaving me behind with my hand still extended. I was still rooted to the spot in shock, looking like a clown.

Lisa pulled me aside to our desks and began gossiping. ""Avril, you saw her earlier, right? That's Mr. Floyd's fiancée!

""That pink diamond necklace around her neck was given by Mr. Floyd. I heard it's worth millions! But what he did was way too obvious!

""You've been working at the company for five years. Everyone here knows how capable you are. But Mr. Floyd just gave your spot away so easily to someone else!""

I nodded distractedly. From the start, I already planned on resigning from my job. After Vernon passed me over and made Peggy director, it was even clearer to me now that I meant nothing to him.

With the documents and my resignation letter in hand, I knocked on the door to Vernon's office.

""Come in."" .

I set everything on the table, including all the information I had to hand over after my resignation.

Vernon flipped through those files, and his expression darkened even further. Finally, he looked up at me with a disdainful smirk.

""Avril, I thought you already turned over a new leaf yesterday, and you won't throw tantrums anymore. Now, you're back to your usual self?"" With that, Vernon threw the files toward me, aiming for my face.

I stood aside and managed to dodge the files. Then, I crouched on the floor and began picking up what Vernon had thrown to the floor.

Vernon explained, ""All Peggy did was take your chance for a promotion. Besides, she and I studied the same major.

""I have full confidence in her abilities, and that's why I made her Technical Director. You're still working at an entry-level position after five years. There's no need to be this angry!""

I stacked the files together before setting them on Vernon's desk. I said calmly, ""I'm not angry. All I want is to resign.""

Peggy and Vernon studied the same major, and he claimed that he knew her abilities very well. But what about me?

I studied jewelry design during college. Later, I ended up pursuing a second degree for Vernon and worked very hard day and night so I could catch up with him.

In the end, all my efforts were worthless to him.

Vernon shot me a condescending glare. ""Don't you know how useless you are? I've already transferred you to work under Peggy. In the future, watch and learn from her.""

I smiled. ""My time is precious too. I won't ever work on anything I'm not interested in.""

""Fine! Then, leave! Let's see which company would even want to hire you!"" With that, Vernon got up from his office chair and looked at me, his gaze filled with malice.

I turned to leave his office.

Vernon and I had been together for six years, which were all for nothing. But in the future, my world would never revolve around him anymore.

After all, he expected me to look up to Peggy.

Chapter 4

At noon, I returned to my desk to pack up my things.

An asteroid figurine sat on the table. It was Vernon who carved it for me after graduation. Back then, he even said that I would be his whole world.

I let out a self-deprecating laugh. I gave the figurine one last glance and finally decided to take it along with me.

I held a box of my belongings. I was about to leave when Peggy suddenly hurried into the office, looking panicked.

""My apologies, everyone. The necklace I wore today seems to have gone missing. Could everyone please cooperate for a quick search?""

Everyone in the office began whispering to each other.

""I saw Ms. Cahill's necklace earlier when she first came to the office. The diamonds on it were huge! So bright and sparkly!""

""I think Ms. Cahill was being nice about it. I bet someone got greedy after seeing that necklace, so they stole it!""

""My goodness! We actually have a thief in our office. No wonder my biscuits and snacks kept going missing from my table!""

Vernon stood next to Peggy. After ordering security to block off all exits, they began searching everyone.

Once it was my turn, I set the box down so I could cooperate with the search. Clearly, Vernon was momentarily startled upon noticing the asteroid figurine at the very top of the box. However, he still asked security to dump all the contents of the box onto the floor.

Everything fell to the floor with a loud crash. The figurine was completely smashed to bits.

It was like my relationship of six years with Vernon. Once there were cracks, things between us could never be fixed again.

A few guards started going through the contents on the floor. Suddenly, Peggy covered her mouth and gasped. ""My necklace!""

Her gasp of surprise drew everyone's attention. All eyes fell on me, and everyone began criticizing me behind my back.

""Oh my! It was Avril who stole the new director's necklace! If Mr. Floyd hadn't blocked the office exits, she would've been long gone with it!""

""I never expected Avril to be that kind of person! We really can't judge a book by its cover. All the new director did was take Avril's promotion. She's so petty!""

""Avril's really narrow-minded. I never realized she would do sneaky stuff like that. I'm glad she's already resigned. Otherwise, I'd be nervous to work in the same room as her!""

I turned extremely pale. I definitely did not steal Peggy's necklace. Someone had tampered with my things once I left to submit my resignation.

Fury was written all over Vernon's face as he picked up the pink diamond necklace from the pile of junk. He looked extremely disappointed in me.

""Avril!"" Vernon yelled my name furiously. I looked over and noticed he had stepped all over my things. He even stomped hard on the shattered pieces of the asteroid figurine.

As soon as I looked up, Vernon slapped me without a word. ""Apologize to Peggy! Why did you steal the necklace I gave her?""

At that moment, I lost all hope. Vernon was still holding the million-dollar necklace he had given to Peggy, and the cheap figurine he had given me was crushed under his foot. The figurine wasn't even worth a fraction of the necklace.

Tears instantly welled up in my eyes. Sure, my colleagues had misunderstood me. But Vernon and I had dated for six years. His slap had left me heartbroken.

Vernon actually didn't believe me.

Seeing that I hadn't responded, Vernon dragged me toward Peggy as if I was nothing but trash. He snapped at me, ""I asked you to apologize! Explain why you stole her necklace!""

A satisfactory glint flashed through Peggy's eyes. But very quickly, she pretended to frown before reaching out to pull me up from the cold floor.

I shook Peggy's hand off. I clung to my last shred of pride as I got to my feet.

Although my eyes were brimming with tears, I stood tall and yelled, ""I didn't take the necklace! There are surveillance cameras in the office. I want you to show the footage so I can prove that I'm innocent!

""Besides, it's just a diamond necklace! It's nothing to me!""

Chapter 5

""That's enough! Stop causing a fuss!"" Vernon covered my mouth before dragging me outside the office. He pressed his hand against my mouth and nose so hard, as if he were trying to suffocate me.

I heard Peggy chuckling with my colleagues in the office. She remarked, ""Since I found my necklace, I didn't end up losing anything.

""Avril and I are colleagues, so I've decided to let it slide. I'll buy afternoon tea for everyone later. Thank you for cooperating with our search!""

Vernon seemed terrified that I would expose my relationship with him in front of everyone. So, he led me to the pantry.

""Tell me! What are you actually up to? No matter how angry you are, you shouldn't go overboard."" Vernon said while pinching his temples. He seemed extremely troubled by the incident.

I was gasping for air. There were dark bruises on my face where he had gripped hard.

""When did you become like this? You're lucky that Peggy was generous enough to forgive you. I want you to apologize to her immediately!""

""I won't apologize to her. If I didn't steal her necklace, why should I take the blame?"" I glared at Vernon.

He asked when I had changed. Well, I wanted to know when he became someone I no longer knew.

Peggy entered the pantry. She filled a paper cup with some hot water and handed it to me.

""Avril, have some water and calm down. I know you're holding a grudge against me now, but you shouldn't be so rash next time.""

I didn't accept the cup of water. However, Peggy got burned by the hot water in the cup and ended up splashing the water onto my arm.

""Oh! It burns…"" The hot water scalded Peggy's finger. Vernon hurriedly led her to the tap and placed her finger under the running water.

As for me, I was dressed lightly. The hot water had soaked through my chiffon top, scalding my arm instantly.

I went to the restroom to handle the burn on my own. Very quickly, red blisters began forming on my left wrist.

Despite the pain, I returned to my workstation to pack my things. Suddenly, Vernon appeared and grabbed my wrist, causing me to hiss in pain.

Clearly startled, he let go of me and asked awkwardly, ""Are you okay?""

I was slightly amused. My cheek had turned red from Vernon's slap. Peggy even scalded my wrist on purpose.

Vernon's feigned look of concern made me want to throw up. I shook his hand off before tossing the things that had fallen onto the floor into the rubbish bin.

Vernon seemed like he was about to say more but decided to walk away. All he said was, ""You were too rash today.""

After picking up all my scattered belongings on the floor, I headed for the office's surveillance room. I wasn't about to let Vernon and Peggy slander me for nothing.

However, I came to a standoff with the employee in the surveillance room.

I mentioned that I wanted to check the surveillance footage from the morning in the office. However, the employee stopped me and said I had no right to check the footage.

I realized that my employee account had been blacklisted and deleted. Clearly, Vernon was behind this. He was already determined to take Peggy's side and was certain that I had stolen her necklace.

I smiled bitterly. I never knew that the stoic Vernon could be blinded by love.

Very quickly, I remembered that this tech company belonged to the Walkers. I decided to hurry home and meet Dylan.

I returned to the apartment where I had lived for the past six years and moved all my belongings out of the place.

At the same time, I wiped out all traces of my relationship with Vernon. It was like I had just taken out the trash in my life.

At night, another delivery man dropped off a premium burn ointment. All I did was toss it onto the table.

Before leaving, I gave this empty apartment one last glance.

The next day, I booked a flight ticket to Paloria. I also handed over all my unfinished work and gave some instructions to the ex-colleague who had taken over my place.

On the third day, I wheeled my luggage into the airport. Before boarding the plane, I sent a breakup message to Vernon's alternate account.",1,1755848109.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1mx00d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1mx00d8/getting_disowned_but_fr_this_time/,Getting disowned (but fr this time),"Hi everyone. I feel really desperate writing this but I saw some posts here with situations close to mine and I feel so lost right now. I’m in my early twenties and a daughter of Iraqi Christian parents. I mention that because if you’re familiar with the history of genocides and persecution of indigenous Iraqis you’d maybe understand how the generations have hardened my parents. I was born there and came to the US as a refugee when I was around 5th grade age. 

I feel as though my entire life I was an afterthought and whenever I try to mention that I too had a difficult childhood my family acts as though I had just said the most unbelievable thing. My entire childhood I was not allowed to befriend ANYONE, I have vivid memories of neighborhood kids standing outside my home gate asking me to play with them and my parents vehemently refusing every time. I had barely gone to school in our country because it was unsafe, I was extremely under-socialized and had the worst experience  when I came to the US and started school. No one in my family was close to my age or had time to focus on me. My siblings had finished high school by the time we came to the US and we couldn’t be more different. My sister took care of me as much as she could, however, I was never meant to be her responsibility and she was reasonably very busy. After we came to the US, I learned through my exposure to the outside world that my family was extremely strict. My father especially seemed to get stricter as the years went by. My siblings never moved out, my sister did after she got married and my other sibling has no plans to leave our parents home.

I remember fantasizing about the day I get to move out all the time. My relationship with my father became more strained the more I began to think for myself. I loved my father so deeply as a child, he sacrificed so much for our family and I went through several heartbreaks during my adolescence when his actions would break the image of him I had in my heart. His love is so conditional. He has this idea of perfection that I need to meet that takes into no account my wishes or autonomy. When I was a child he drilled into me that I need to operate like a robot and detach myself from all emotions so that I can be “perfect”. He would boast about how I was his favorite daughter because of how intelligent I am, writing this even feels silly because I barely remember a time in the past 10 years that he said something about me that wasn’t an insult. When I was 13 I began to take conflict with some of the things I noticed he would say, he would use “science” to justify his racism, sexism, and any and all isms. Most of what he would say was so easily disprovable that a 2 second google search would point it out. I would be like, “hey here’s 200 sources that say you’re wrong (in a respectful way ofc)” and everyone in my family would lose their minds because who was I to correct my father?? And my sources are all stupid and even though there is nothing actually scientific that supports my father’s statements it’s because he’s a genius that studied (a very specific field) in college and no one knows more than him! He once said something about how rape is always a woman’s fault except in times of war (how progressive) and I remember trying to have him dissect this thought and it just unraveled so much about his character that I just felt complete doom realizing the man that was meant to be my father would fundamentally always hate me because I was a woman. My father can do no wrong in my family’s eyes, his every view and opinion is their own. There is no protest and no opinion that differs from my father’s, I was always the only one that would call him out. When he would do anything against my siblings or mother I would speak out and defend them but they’ve never done the same for me. Despite being the youngest and my family being convinced that I am the way that I am because I was “spoiled” I really struggle to understand how I was. My siblings grew up wealthy, I got a job at 14 because I was scared to burden my parents for new shoes even though I burned holes through the soles of my old ones. My siblings completed a full private school education filled with tutors, my parents were very engaged in their education, meanwhile they never once cared to check my grades or meet my teachers. I was a better student than both my siblings (I only say this because this is a common fact in my household, they simply weren’t into education and that’s completely okay), I had straight A’s and only took advanced/AP classes, I was in two varsity sports, I started my own organization and was a part of 10 different clubs, I would try to tell them what I’m up to and my family would shrug me off each time. They never knew a thing about my life and not for a lack of me trying to share. My entire existence was wrong to my family because I would voice different views.

My father told me when I was 15 that if I keep going on this “path” where I was brainwashed by western culture that he would make sure no one in my family would ever speak to me till he dies. I have never done anything “wrong” besides having my own beliefs, I had never been texting a boy, I never changed my religion, I didn’t even swear, I didn’t do drugs, I didn’t even have friends because my father insisted friends are for stupid weak people, I did everything they wanted me to do and it was never enough. 

I had dreamt of going away for college, I applied to a bunch of schools in-state but my goal was to get into 2 specific east coast universities. After applying to a bunch of colleges I was $35 short for my favorite school and I had to ask my father for the money. That was genuinely the most humiliating experience, he made me swear that I would keep my virginity and that I relinquish every personal view I had that differed from him. He asked me when the application deadline was and gave me his card on the last day to submit the application. The next day, I hear him screaming and slamming things which isn’t uncommon but he says something about his card being stolen. I come out and hear him yelling at the bank CSR about the $35 charge, I try to intervene and remind him that it was for my application and he continues talking with the CSR until they voided the payment. Afterwards he screamed at me because “I never told him about the application” and that he never gave me his card. I will never forget this moment because of the way his pupils were so enlarged and how he looked like he had a smile on his face. He was genuinely happy to be crushing my dreams and he was enjoying watching me sob on the floor after he broke my pride one day earlier by making me give up my beliefs and beg him for money. 

I ended up going to a school that was 2 hours away from my parents. I made up a lie that first year students had to live on campus. It wasn’t until I was in college that I really began to understand how traumatized I was. I had a mental block on everything, I couldn’t talk about my feelings or things in my childhood like I literally physically could not no matter how much I tried, it felt like my jaw was wired shut. Everyone around me was so much more developed emotionally than me, I felt small in comparison. The independence of living away from my parents made me feel like a real person, they still had my location and monitored and called me 24/7 but the first time I walked outside and decided I wanted to grab a coffee and it was a decision that was 100% my own…I can’t even describe how this little thing felt so so wrong. I learned so much about myself just doing things alone and without feeling like someone is going to scream at me 24/7. 

At the time I was double majoring in bio and poli sci, so basically pre med and also exploring other topics. My parents up to this point had NEVER voiced an opinion on what I study. In fact, my father always said he doesn’t respect doctors and that he didn’t want me to be a doctor. I have a deep love for advocacy and I learned early in college that I wanted to become an attorney so I stopped my premed classes. My parents knew I made this change my second semester at school and did not say anything. Fast forward the summer before my 3rd year at college, my sister takes me aside and tells me how I broke my father’s heart because I didn’t want to be a doctor. I’m like ?? Huh?? And apparently my father wasn’t the “same” after I changed majors a year ago. After a lot of guilt tripping, I told her I was thinking about it but that it was not likely that I change back for several reasons including that my scholarship only covers 4 years and I would need to take another year to complete it. I asked her not to tell anyone that I was considering it until I’m sure it’s something I can do. After doing the math and weighing with knowing that I would be doing 10 years of schooling and training for something that would give me no satisfaction whatsoever I told my sister I couldn’t do it. She lost it (always had really bad anger issues and got violent sometimes but I had never seen her this angry). She told me she told my parents that I changed my mind already. When I saw my parents they were so excited to see me now that I “changed” my mind. I took my father aside to try and explain that I didn’t intend to change majors and apologize for unintentionally hurting him by not wanting to do medicine and all hell broke loose. My entire family spent two full days saying everything they could to hurt, I spent the two days in my room with my thin walls hearing them laugh about how stupid I was, scream about how much of a disappointment I was and how I was paying them back them back for not hitting me as a child, it just never ended. My father would talk about how his biggest mistake was not making my mother abort me even though everyone advised them to because I was born during times of war. They would physically pick me apart, truly the most heinous things you could say to a person they said about me loud enough to make sure I would hear it. Eventually my mother came in and told me since I’m not going to be a doctor I’m not going to be anything and that they will not allow me to go back to school. I ran away to my college roommate while they were all at the dinner table talking about me, they threatened to drag me back and in a final FaceTime they told me if I spent the night outside their house they would be done with me forever, I asked if I could come back would they allow to go back to school (not even asking them to pay for anything I had been figuring it out alone anyway, my father paid for my sisters cosmology school but he made it clear early on that I’m on my own) and they said no. When I replied that I won’t be coming back my mother fainted and my father spit on me through the phone. Then there’s a knock on my friend’s door and it’s my brother in law telling me my mom is in an ambulance and they’re taking her to the hospital. As they’re driving me back I’m asking what hospital and is my mom okay to no replies, they ended up just driving me back to the house where my mother was laying post panic attack, my sister started screaming and hitting me and because I was so exhausted and numb I didn’t do anything to protect myself or shield her blows. They decided that me not reacting at all to being hit meant I was on drugs. The next day everyone acted as though nothing happened. On my birthday, my mother said to choose college or my family. I said college and she said this is your last birthday with us and lit the candles on the cake and sang happy birthday as I sobbed and my father yelled insults at me. I spent my junior year couch surfing and commuting back and forth, throughout all this I also had a job and been saving to get a place. I also had a professor connect me with the dean because I was a student at risk of homelessness. I truly went through hell and my parents only ended up not cutting me off because I was mostly commuting (which with my schedule meant waking up at 4am, taking two trains to get to class and eventually getting back to the house at 10pm every night). Seeing me struggle this much and have unsafe situations happen convinced my parents to let me get an apartment, I told them that I can pay for it myself since I’ve been saving for it anyway but my father insisted he contribute. I didn’t take this as a kind gesture, my father only offers things he can take away later to control me.

My apartment is in a very safe area and close to school, my building is very secure and requires you pass through three different locked doors before you even reach my floor. He installed a ring camera INSIDE my apartment for “safety”. I want to reiterate that not once have I gone out past sunset or gone somewhere outside campus without their knowledge. He started telling me a few months ago that if I wanted to keep my apartment, I just need to get a job after I graduate. Then he changed his mind and said I’ll only help you make the payments till September, afterwards I can get a full time job and keep the apartment. He had a rebrand where on the drive from the house to my apartment (I came home almost every weekend and sometimes he drove me back) he would say that a parents job just is to set their children up for success and that he just wants us to be happy. I’m close to graduating and I recently got a great job to start after while I save for law school, I announced this last week and my father said “so you’re keeping the apartment” and I said yes. Even taking finances into account, me keeping the apartment was the most logical decision. And he ofc blew up and said his usual line of “only a dog sleeps outside the house” and “we don’t have unmarried woman who leave their families” and the entire family exploded on me just like last time. The worst things they can think of they said about me, my father tried to make me end my lease because he stopped helping with rent and because he took me off the phone plan, that didn’t phase me because I’ve expected him to try and financially force me. This not stopping me convinced him that I have money that I don’t use to help the family (I honestly don’t, I have just enough to make sure I can get by and I’ve always planned to send money home once I had a stable full time job). He’s saying it if I don’t give up the apartment he will make sure no one in my family speaks to me again. This would’ve been great and I wouldn’t mind if it wasn’t for my mother and my baby niece. My mother definitely DEFINITIVELY has her faults but she is the type to become physically ill every time she goes through something traumatic. Everyone in my extended and close family is telling me that me leaving will actually kill her and I do genuinely believe that is a possibility. I do love her, despite everything we had some moments where it was pure soft mother-daughter love and I see her as a victim of my fathers control more than I see her as free willingly person trying to hurt me. God I really do love her I’m so heartbroken, she does everything my father asks she even cut off her own mother because my father had a problem with her. My father keeps telling her to act as though I died and I see how this is already affecting her and her blood pressure is high. My baby niece is turning one soon and I was uninvited from her baptism and birthday. This just all feels like the world is falling on top of me. I want to still come home on weekends and call my momma and hold my beautiful niece. 

My father said to me last year that I died in his eyes the second I ran away from home, he told me this unprompted and after everyone else went to sleep and we were watching something on TV. He told he will do everything he can to make sure I suffer for choosing myself over my family and that if I somehow make it to law school that he will make sure I had changed my last name before I graduated. He has timed all of his biggest blowups on or around my birthday, it’s like his little reminder that he wishes I was never born. 

Everyone is telling me I need to give up the apartment and commute back and forth everyday for work (2 hours one way). I don’t even know anymore, my mother swears that when I get into law school she will make sure I have an apartment during school. A big thing in their side is that it’s been fine that I have been living outside the house because I was at school but that once I graduate and start only working that’s it’s against the culture. “What will people say” and “how will this taint the family” and saying that I’m hurting the chances of my siblings getting married in the future. Maybe I am being selfish but I honestly don’t know how I can mentally survive moving back home, I know what prison it will be and I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to get out again.

Sorry for this being so long, what do you think/did you go through a similar experience? I had so much more happen over the years but I tried to share the most relevant information. My heart hurts so much I feel as though I’ve grieved the loss of my whole family 3 times already and I know this time will be the worst and final time from how it’s playing out.

Two guys entrenched in a deep and intense discussion, very serious faces:  « no! the big one is Obelix, Asterix is the smaller one »

 

Helena Hauff, famously social media- and smartphone-less person, was somehow dubbed « the woman without internet » during lineup discussions. during her pounding set at the warehouse someone went: i’d play like that too, if i had no internet.

After that, « the woman without internet » became our patron saint of both, being gloriously offline as well as frustratingly so (no payment possible an Trevino’s etc.)

 

To the girl with the huge shades, blonde streak in dark hair, analog camera and sports bomber jacket prowling through Pavillion during Jane Fitz: aura was felt.

 

En route to Terminus a group of first timers was approached by a gaggle of jersey shore geese, plucked eyebrows, fake tans and all. «you lo' knuh the woy to terrrminas?» after fruitlessly stumbling through the camp and not getting ANY info from passers by and just being led in circles by the red scripted info-boards the consensus was reached that it was all a big massive joke on the boutique dwellers, so they would at least once set foot into general camp. The gaggle eventually gave up and turned around. Our group, somewhere midway through coming up on something that was clearly beyond a microdose, had caught on to the doubts and actual paranoia was starting to brew. Had our lord and saviour Craig really built up a ruse on the scale of the moon landing?  Just to to have a laugh at our elitist expense? Chemically vulnerabalized feelings were starting to get hurt, while simultaneously the hilarity of this audacious plan feeding on our fragile rave vanities was heralded as the grandest idea of our time.  When finally a wonky tripped out bassline wafted out from the woods and we eyed a woodplanked entrance, a collective sigh of relief trembled through the group. We descended on the spectacular hole in the ground and the next couple of hours are lost from memory. Since none of that group returned for a second round (or got helplessly lost in the night), we’re now not actually so sure we ever found it.

 

To the greybearded bloke raving alongside me to the women without internet, exchanging multiple grins and then sharing a heartfelt hug afterwards: may your pillow always have a cool side.

 

To the the less than 100 or so heads who I shared the Warehouse with for Polygonia’s blindingly perfect two hours of dark, trippy, multidimensional layers of polyrhythmic joy, you made my year. I needed to flee from the sun and crowds because, reasonas, you lot along with Polygonia masterful set set carried me through a truly cathartic acid trip.

 

As a young first timer, who has only been to « up the ra »-like festivals and big headliner open airs before, it felt truly humbling and comforting to witness so many people who cared about their surrounding crowd. That short but sweet « you good ? need some water ? we’ve all been there»  from the older guy at the side of pavillion during nicolas lutz was all i needed after almost chucking up. I’ve heard about PLUR but this was the first time i actually witnessed it throughout several days.

 

AAAAARGH THE FUCKING CHATTER !!!  
CAN YOU LOT PLEASE SHUT UP AND LOOK WHERE YOUR’E GOING.  
I get it, we had to queue for hours and you’re itching to get your rave on, but for fuck’s sake it’s Thursday night , theres still a long way to go and i want to hear the tunes and not why Isak is a traitor!! At least have the decency to check on me, after you barged into me with a fucking labubu on your ridiculous pole. Game’s truly gone.

Two nights later when Mala drops that Midnight Request Line Remix: « WHY ARE YOU LOT SO FUCKING QUIET AND WON'T DANCE? »

 

To the young topless guy with curly hair who i exchanged grins and thumbs-ups with several times when bumping into each other at several different corners during Jane Fitz at Pavillion: bless you! Each time i got lost in thoughts and forgot to be right there, you magically turned up and gave me cheeky reminder to take it all in.

 

During Peach at Pavillion, two guys locked into an epic impromptu dance off, shook hands and went their merry way without exchanging a word. Everone around was equally confused & amused & amazed.  

  
A: partying for four days, with lots of sleep, three meals a day, having had two beers and a shot, feeling generally relaxed and well. 

B: messy amalgamation of substances, odd bits of sleep and food. 

discussing their raving history.

endresult is: ""we should hang out more""

 

« damn, must be great to get all these fresh dubs from your producer mates » 

« that’s a twenty year old Chemical Brothers record »

« He’s mates with Chemical Brothers ???! »

Greg Paulus & Band at the old gramophone, playing jazz like it was techno. WTF THAT WAS BLOODY BRILLIANT. I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH YOUR GAME. PLEASE ACCEPT MY HUMBLE APOLOGY

 

Guy orders a Toastie. Leaves with no trace. After a while the vendor goes : «Phil ? Toastie for Phil ? ………. (Colleague chimes in) Phil? where are you?...............(vendor, now at full volume) «PHIL !!.......PHIL GODDAMIT, MATE !!.....DON ‘T LEAVE ME LIKE THIS…. DON’T DO THIS TO ME……..IT ‘S NOT EVEN ABOUT THE TOASTIE……YOU PAID FOR IT….THIS IS ABOUT PRINCIPLE !!»

Hilarity all around.

Eventually he offers it to a girl who receives it like an offering from heaven.

 

Bloke at Earthlings, we clock each other with stern expressions through the throng, like that one face that’s in focus in a blurry mess of people. You make your way to me and shout in my ear «i think you want a bump of ket». being a veeerry casual user and having not planned it whatsoever,  this hasn’t crossed my mind at this point. but immediately  there is little in the world that makes more sense. i silently nod. You hold up the bump on the handle of a wooden coffee spoon claiming «fresh spoon, mate», i sniff, we exchange serious nods, you leave. The wobbles ensue.

Richie Hawtin at Derren Smart plays like in the glory days. Layering, looping, dropping the groove after meticulously crafted build ups. I get pulled in and dance, eyes closed. When i open them, this girl in gym shorts and a sports bra holds up a high five with a manic laugh. most people around us just do their left/right step, apparently oblivious that they’re witnessing a legend’s return to form, while we are locked in proper. When i leave, we exchange a heartfelt hug and thank you’s and i stumble off into the darkness under the moonbeam.

 

NDAGGA RHYTHM FORCE. That is all. You know if you were there.

 

«What’s that Dr Banana-tune with the hilarious chatter?»

«which one?»

We exchanged glances and dancemoves about 50 metres apart, when Jane Fitz dropped that crazy epic Dirt Bomb-tune at Pavillion. Sending vibes! 

 

 To the girl pantomiming chucking moves when Ben UFO played that 4/4 tune with the humungous, gurgling basstone: You got stage chops.

 

Eating various foods in various states brought on some do or don’t combos (opinions differ):

DO :

weed & anything savoury (obviously bit old that one, but familiarity brings comfort in dire situations)

pizza after mdma (but long after)

mdma & ice cream

Acid & noodles (once you embrace that those squirming worms are nourishing and delicious)

 

DON’T :

Ket & anything resembling any action that would otherwise make sense

«i’m starving, let’s get some fries» (rips fat slug of coke) «let’s go to Terminus»

Acid & noodles (most foods really but this specifically)

Yet, when I stand in front of him in my birthday suit and a pair of bunny ears, all he does is worry that I'll catch a cold and wrap me in a blanket.

I used to think his restraint came from being the mafia don, that he was saving our first time for our wedding night.

However, one month before the ceremony, he secretly plans the city's grandest fireworks show to celebrate his childhood sweetheart's birthday.

They hug and share a slice of cake in public. That night, they check into a hotel.

…

The next morning, I watch them leave together. That's when I realize Declan is not restrained. He just doesn't love me, so I walk out of the hotel.

I call my parents. ""Dad, I've broken up with Declan. I'll marry into the Sullivan family as planned.""

My father is stunned. ""I thought you were madly in love with Declan. Why did you break up? I heard Bryson can't have children. You've always loved kids. What will you do once you marry him?""

""It's fine,"" I reply, disheartened. ""We can always adopt.""

Chapter 1

For five long years, Declan Gibson and I kept our relationship hidden. I had tried to seduce him more times than I could count.

Yet, one month before our wedding ceremony, he quietly organized the city's grandest fireworks display for his childhood sweetheart's birthday.

After they embraced in public, they shared a slice of cake. They even checked into a hotel together later that night.

…

I watched them leave the hotel, side by side. That was when the truth hit me—Declan wasn't showing restraint. He just didn't love me.

As I exited the hotel, I rang my parents. ""Dad, I'm done with Declan. I'll marry into the Sullivan family as planned.""

Shocked, my dad replied, ""I thought you were madly in love with Declan. How did you two break up? I also heard that Bryson is infertile. You've always wanted a family, so what are you going to do once you marry him?""

""It's fine,"" came my voice, laced with resignation. ""There's always adoption.""

My words left my dad stunned. Then, he pressed, ""Do you know that Bryson was in a car crash last year? He suffered nerve damage to his lower body. He can't have kids anymore! If you marry him, you'll be a widow in all but name!""

My hand holding the phone shook slightly. So what if I was a widow in all but name?

""Dad, Mom, I've made up my mind. I'm flying back in three days to get engaged to Bryson,"" I replied. ""Whatever happens after that, good or bad, I'll live with it.""

And with that, I hung up. I knew they loved me, but they didn't know what Declan had put me through.

For the past five years, I was always the one reaching out to him. Yet, he rejected me every time.

I even started to doubt myself. Maybe I wasn't charming enough to turn him on. In the end, I comforted myself with the thought that he just wanted to save our first time for our wedding night.

But now, I knew the truth. It was never about me not being enough. It was because his heart belonged to someone else.

…

I returned to the villa that Declan and I had shared for five years.

In all that time, I loved him with everything I had. My world revolved around him, even if we had to keep our relationship under wraps.

Yesterday should've been our fifth anniversary. Instead, he had celebrated another woman's birthday, complete with roses and champagne.

Hidden behind the crowd, I watched as Declan's friends raised their glasses to them.

""May you two live happily ever after!""

""Declan, don't forget to invite us to the wedding!""

The more I thought about it, the sharper the irony cut. We had been together for years, yet his friends didn't even know I existed.

But they all knew her.

I had seen a fireworks show scheduled on Declan's phone and assumed it was for our anniversary. So, I followed him quietly. I thought he was preparing a surprise for me, only to find out it was for someone else.

Just then, the doorbell rang.

I opened the door to a delivery guy holding a cake. ""Ma'am, here's the cake your boyfriend ordered for you.""

I took the box from him, opened it, and saw the message.

""Happy anniversary, sweetheart!""

My hands trembled the moment I saw it.

Declan had ordered the cake, and the handwriting was his. Every year on our anniversary, he'd always have a cake delivered, with a note written for me.

Once upon a time, that would've made me cry tears of joy. However, it now made me sick.

I set the cake down on the table and lifted the lid. The delicate design and pastel colors were supposed to be sweet, but all they did was make me queasy.

I dumped the cake in the trash. Then, I looked up at the chandelier. The lights flickered softly, as if they were mocking how foolish and pathetic I had been.

Before I knew it, tears slipped down my cheeks, falling onto the couch and disappearing without a trace.

At that moment, the door swung open.

Declan walked in and stopped short when he saw me curled up on the couch.

""Scarlett, why are you still awake?""

Chapter 2

Declan stood there, holding a bouquet of red roses. Yet, his face showed not the faintest trace of guilt.

After a pause, he said, ""Scarlett, these are for you. Your favorite red roses.""

I took the flowers from him and brought them to my nose. I used to love the scent, but it made my stomach turn instead.

Declan stared at me. After a long silence, he finally spoke.

""Scarlett, Beatrice… has stomach cancer. The doctors say she doesn't have much time left. Her dying wish is to marry me. So…""

He hesitated for a moment. Then, he continued, ""I'm getting engaged to her in three days. You've always been so empathetic. I know you'll understand my reasons, right?""

I looked at him. He suddenly felt like a stranger. Was this really the man I had loved for five years?

Still, I nodded slightly. ""Okay.""

A flicker of surprise crossed Declan's face. Clearly, he hadn't expected me to agree so easily.

Then again, he used to say I was reckless, immature, and too possessive. I'd get upset any time a woman approached him. He claimed that I wasn't like other girlfriends—calm and understanding.

So, of course, he was surprised I didn't even get angry about him getting engaged to someone else.

Maybe he realized he had gone too far, because he kept explaining. ""Scarlett, I knew you'd understand. Don't worry. Once this is over, we'll get married. Beatrice only has a month or two left.""

I looked down at the roses in my hand, and a dull ache tugged at my chest.

""Okay."" I nodded again without the slightest hesitation.

Declan's gaze lingered on me, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. ""Thank you, Scarlett.""

Then, he stepped closer and reached for my face.

I pretended to put the flowers in a vase, just to avoid his touch.

Just hours ago, he had been holding Beatrice Porter's hand. I didn't want those same hands touching me.

On top of that, the smell of her perfume still clung to him, and it made me want to pull away.

Declan looked at me, clearly sensing my resistance. His brow furrowed in irritation as he called out, ""Scarlett?""

After all, I had never once pushed back against him in all these years.

""I'm tired,"" I said simply. ""I need to rest.""

I kept my head down and walked straight to the bedroom without looking at him.

Meanwhile, Declan stood there, staring at my retreating figure. All at once, his temper flared up.

""Why are you giving me an attitude? Didn't I tell you? Beatrice doesn't have much time left. Can't you just try to be a little more understanding?"" he snapped.

With that, he turned and stormed out.

As the door closed, I looked around the empty room. To my surprise, all I felt was calm.

I threw the red roses into the trash to accompany the cake Declan bought. Then, I began to pack.

Over the past five years, I had filled the entire house with things I'd bought. However, now that I had gone through it all, I realized I didn't have much worth keeping. I threw all the clothes, shoes, and bags into the trash.

As for the memories we shared, I didn't want them either.

Chapter 3

The next day, I walked into Declan's company and handed in my resignation.

My coworker, Ruth Collins, stared at me in disbelief. ""Scarlett, are you out of your mind? You're about to be promoted to Chief Technology Officer. If you quit now, all that hard work will go to waste!""

I smiled but didn't say a word.

The title was something I had spent years fighting tooth and nail to earn. But what did it matter now? Declan and I were done, and staying in his company just made me sick.

""I'm getting married soon. I'll probably help out at my husband's firm,"" I answered.

Ruth froze momentarily. Then, she broke into a smile. ""Oh! Well, congratulations! Speaking of weddings, Mr. Gibson is getting married, too. I can't believe he's engaged to Beatrice. But honestly, they do look great together.

""No wonder he always kept his distance from women. Turns out, he's in love with her. And I heard they've known each other since they were kids.""

She kept talking, but I turned and walked away. I couldn't bear to hear another word. Knowing that the man I had dated for years was about to marry someone else cut deep.

At that moment, the office door swung open. Declan walked in with Beatrice in tow.

Everyone stood as soon as they entered.

""Good morning!"" Beatrice greeted brightly. She looked radiant, nothing like someone who was supposed to be dying of cancer.

Declan wrapped an arm around her waist, smiling warmly. ""Let me introduce you all. This is Beatrice Porter. She'll be our new CTO.""

""Welcome, Ms. Porter,"" came a chorus of greetings.

Everyone gave her a warm welcome, except me. I stayed exactly where I was, completely still.

Right then, Declan's gaze landed on me. His expression darkened as he snapped, ""Scarlett Fletcher, did you not hear me introduce the new CTO? You can't even say hello?""

I pressed my lips together and remained silent.

Beatrice, on the other hand, smiled and extended a hand toward me.

""You must be Scarlett. Declan has told me about you,"" she began. ""Looks like we'll be working together now. Be kind to me, okay?""

I stared at her outstretched hand and felt nothing but provocation in the gesture. I had worked for years to earn that CTO role, but the moment she joined the company, it was handed to her on a silver platter.

It felt like a slap in the face. In Declan's eyes, I had never been the one he truly favored.

Then, Beatrice leaned in close and whispered, ""Oh, Scarlett. You dated Declan for years, and he never once introduced you to anyone. He never loved you. If you know what's good for you, get out of here.""

Having said her piece, she pulled back. The sweet smile was still plastered on her face. It was as if we were close friends.

""Scarlett, your earrings are gorgeous,"" she commented, as though she had just leaned in to admire my jewelry and not to deliver a warning.

Declan tugged her back to his side, saying, ""No need to be that polite to a regular employee. Those earrings are just cheap knock-offs. They're nothing worth complimenting.""

With that, he wrapped an arm around Beatrice's waist again and walked off.

…

Meanwhile, I stood there with my hand suspended. I felt like a fool.

Ruth couldn't help but mutter, ""Seriously? That was a bit much, even for Mr. Gibson. Even if he's trying to impress his fiancee, did he really have to say that? Doesn't he care how that makes us feel?""

I lowered my head, pulled my hand back, and tightened my grip on the resignation letter.

Chapter 4

I knocked on Declan's office door, with the resignation letter in hand.

When he saw me, his brow furrowed. ""What are you doing here?""

""Mr. Gibson, this is my resignation,"" I explained as I handed him the envelope.

Declan froze for a moment, then his expression darkened. ""Are you seriously quitting?""

""Yes.""

""So, yesterday was all just an act, huh? You pretended not to care, but here you are, trying to make a scene?"" he shot back with a sneer. ""Scarlett, do you think you can survive without me?""

Back then, I had cut off ties with my family to be with Declan. They never thought he was anything special. And at the time, he hadn't become the mafia don.

He had always been the last one anyone expected to rise to power.

But I loved him for who he was, not for his status. That was why I moved to this city, and the very reason he believed I'd never leave him.

I had no intention of letting him know that I was leaving. With someone as controlling as him, he'd never let me go if he found out.

""I'm just tired. I need a break from work, that's all. I'm not picking a fight with you.""

Declan's expression turned grim. He studied me, trying to figure out if I was telling the truth.

Moments later, he slipped the letter into a drawer and said, ""Then, take a leave of absence. There's no need to resign.""

I pressed my lips together and turned to leave. Since I had already made up my mind, his approval didn't matter anymore.

I had just reached the door when I heard a panicked voice behind me.

""Declan, what do I do? My necklace is missing!""

It was Beatrice. She looked frantic, clutching a fancy gift box. ""I swear I left it right here! How could it just disappear?""

Declan's face tightened, but his tone stayed soft as he reassured her, ""Don't worry. I'll help you find it.""

Then, he looked up and barked at the security, ""Run a full check! Find out who took Beatrice's necklace.""

…

In an instant, the office erupted in chaos, with people whispering and speculating all around.

""Seriously? Someone dared to steal from Beatrice?"" Someone gasped.

Another voice rang out. ""That's a diamond necklace! It's worth a fortune!""

""If I find out who did it, I swear I'll make them pay!""

I stood at the door, hesitating. It didn't feel right to leave now.

It was then that Declan spotted me. ""Scarlett, wait. You're getting searched, too.""

With that, he ordered security to block the exit and sent everyone back to their desks.

One by one, people lined up to have their workstations searched. And soon, it was my turn.

Declan looked at me. Suddenly, his eyes caught the small teddy bear figurine in my drawer. For a split second, guilt flashed across his face.

He had given it to me when we first started dating. It was a token of love. Still, he waved it off and ordered, ""Empty the drawer!""

The security guards tore through my belongings.

In the next second, the teddy bear hit the floor and shattered into pieces. Just like the five years we had spent together, it was now broken and beyond repair.

They rummaged through everything I had but found nothing.

All of a sudden, Beatrice exclaimed, ""I found it!""

She dug through the pile of clutter and pulled the necklace from a narrow gap. ""How did it end up here?""

Declan glanced at me, his face unreadable. Without warning, he slapped me hard. ""Scarlett Fletcher, what do you have to say for yourself? Apologize to Beatrice now!""

I pressed a hand to my burning cheek, and something inside me broke. My eyes stung with unshed tears, but I stood tall. ""I didn't take it, and I'm not apologizing. If you don't believe me, check the surveillance footage. And for the record, I don't give a damn about her necklace.""

Chapter 5

""Do you still think you're the victim?"" Declan spat.

He let out a cold laugh before clamping a hand over my mouth. Without another word, he dragged me out of the office like I was nothing but roadkill.

His grip was iron-tight, and his palm was pressed so hard against my mouth that it felt like he was trying to smother me.

Even as I was dragged out, I heard Beatrice's voice coming from the office. ""Let it go. Maybe Scarlett didn't mean it.""

Then, she chirped, ""I've got the afternoon free. How about I treat everyone to coffee?""

Declan's face clouded over as he dragged me into the pantry.

""Scarlett, if you didn't want me to get engaged with Beatrice, you could've just said so,"" he said, resignation in his voice.

""You agreed to it. Then, you threw a fit, quit your job, and stole her necklace. What are you trying to pull? My parents love Beatrice. They agreed to let us marry, but only after I married her.

""She only has a couple of months left to live. Once she's gone, they'll give us their blessing. I didn't tell you because I didn't want to burden you.

""All these years, I never made our relationship public because my parents said if I stayed with you, I'd lose my chance to become the next head of the mafia.

""Our relationship has been under wraps for so long, and now, we're finally this close to going public. Yet, here you are, acting out again!""

Declan stared at me, furious. He made it sound like I was the one backing out and didn't want to marry him.

""Apologize to Beatrice, and we'll call it even,"" he added.

I kept my hand over my mouth and stared at him coldly. ""I'm not confessing to something I didn't do.""

We had been together for years, and every time I brought up going public, he'd give me the same excuse.

We had to wait until he became the mafia don, but after all this time, I was tired.

At that moment, Beatrice walked in with a cup of water. Stopping in front of me, she said, ""Scarlett, don't blame Declan. He's just worried about me and got a little flustered. I don't blame you, so don't take it to heart.

""Here, have some water. It might help you calm down.""

As she held it out, she pretended to lose her grip. The water spilled directly onto my arm, causing me to cry out in pain.

Beatrice, however, suddenly grabbed her hand and screamed, ""My hand's been scalded!""

Declan's focus was on me. However, the moment he heard her cries, he rushed over and dragged her aside to rinse her hand, completely ignoring the red blisters on my arm.

I watched them walk away, and all I felt was a hollow ache in my chest.

…

Declan didn't come looking for me until later that afternoon. He glanced at my arm, his guilt written all over his face.

""Are you okay?"" he asked.

I nodded and didn't answer.

He let out a sigh, then continued, ""You overreacted today. Beatrice must not know we're together. She doesn't want to be seen as the other woman, so I have to keep my distance from you whenever she's around.

""She already mentioned that she'll let today's matter slide. Can't you do the same? Why did you have to blow it out of proportion?""

He held out an ice pack, ready to place it on my arm. Yet, when I looked at him, all I felt was disappointment.

I swatted his hand away and swept everything from my desk into the trash.

Then, I headed straight for the security room. If I could get the surveillance footage, I could prove I hadn't done anything.

However, just as I reached the door, a security guard stepped in front of me, saying, ""Ms. Fletcher, Mr. Gibson gave orders. You're not allowed inside.""

I froze, a wave of numbness washing over me.

…

Back at the residence, I continued packing. Since everything reminded me of Declan, I wanted none of it.

Someone dropped off a burn ointment that night itself. I knew immediately that it was from Declan. Yet, without giving it another look, I tossed it aside and went back to packing.

…

On the way to the airport, I sent a message to Declan's work number. It read, ""Declan Gibson, we're done.""

Yet, when I stand in front of him in my birthday suit and a pair of bunny ears, all he does is worry that I'll catch a cold and wrap me in a blanket.

I used to think his restraint came from being the mafia don, that he was saving our first time for our wedding night.

However, one month before the ceremony, he secretly plans the city's grandest fireworks show to celebrate his childhood sweetheart's birthday.

They hug and share a slice of cake in public. That night, they check into a hotel.

…

The next morning, I watch them leave together. That's when I realize Declan is not restrained. He just doesn't love me, so I walk out of the hotel.

I call my parents. ""Dad, I've broken up with Declan. I'll marry into the Sullivan family as planned.""

My father is stunned. ""I thought you were madly in love with Declan. Why did you break up? I heard Bryson can't have children. You've always loved kids. What will you do once you marry him?""

""It's fine,"" I reply, disheartened. ""We can always adopt.""

Chapter 1

For five long years, Declan Gibson and I kept our relationship hidden. I had tried to seduce him more times than I could count.

Yet, one month before our wedding ceremony, he quietly organized the city's grandest fireworks display for his childhood sweetheart's birthday.

After they embraced in public, they shared a slice of cake. They even checked into a hotel together later that night.

…

I watched them leave the hotel, side by side. That was when the truth hit me—Declan wasn't showing restraint. He just didn't love me.

As I exited the hotel, I rang my parents. ""Dad, I'm done with Declan. I'll marry into the Sullivan family as planned.""

Shocked, my dad replied, ""I thought you were madly in love with Declan. How did you two break up? I also heard that Bryson is infertile. You've always wanted a family, so what are you going to do once you marry him?""

""It's fine,"" came my voice, laced with resignation. ""There's always adoption.""

My words left my dad stunned. Then, he pressed, ""Do you know that Bryson was in a car crash last year? He suffered nerve damage to his lower body. He can't have kids anymore! If you marry him, you'll be a widow in all but name!""

My hand holding the phone shook slightly. So what if I was a widow in all but name?

""Dad, Mom, I've made up my mind. I'm flying back in three days to get engaged to Bryson,"" I replied. ""Whatever happens after that, good or bad, I'll live with it.""

And with that, I hung up. I knew they loved me, but they didn't know what Declan had put me through.

For the past five years, I was always the one reaching out to him. Yet, he rejected me every time.

I even started to doubt myself. Maybe I wasn't charming enough to turn him on. In the end, I comforted myself with the thought that he just wanted to save our first time for our wedding night.

But now, I knew the truth. It was never about me not being enough. It was because his heart belonged to someone else.

…

I returned to the villa that Declan and I had shared for five years.

In all that time, I loved him with everything I had. My world revolved around him, even if we had to keep our relationship under wraps.

Yesterday should've been our fifth anniversary. Instead, he had celebrated another woman's birthday, complete with roses and champagne.

Hidden behind the crowd, I watched as Declan's friends raised their glasses to them.

""May you two live happily ever after!""

""Declan, don't forget to invite us to the wedding!""

The more I thought about it, the sharper the irony cut. We had been together for years, yet his friends didn't even know I existed.

But they all knew her.

I had seen a fireworks show scheduled on Declan's phone and assumed it was for our anniversary. So, I followed him quietly. I thought he was preparing a surprise for me, only to find out it was for someone else.

Just then, the doorbell rang.

I opened the door to a delivery guy holding a cake. ""Ma'am, here's the cake your boyfriend ordered for you.""

I took the box from him, opened it, and saw the message.

""Happy anniversary, sweetheart!""

My hands trembled the moment I saw it.

Declan had ordered the cake, and the handwriting was his. Every year on our anniversary, he'd always have a cake delivered, with a note written for me.

Once upon a time, that would've made me cry tears of joy. However, it now made me sick.

I set the cake down on the table and lifted the lid. The delicate design and pastel colors were supposed to be sweet, but all they did was make me queasy.

I dumped the cake in the trash. Then, I looked up at the chandelier. The lights flickered softly, as if they were mocking how foolish and pathetic I had been.

Before I knew it, tears slipped down my cheeks, falling onto the couch and disappearing without a trace.

At that moment, the door swung open.

Declan walked in and stopped short when he saw me curled up on the couch.

""Scarlett, why are you still awake?""

Chapter 2

Declan stood there, holding a bouquet of red roses. Yet, his face showed not the faintest trace of guilt.

After a pause, he said, ""Scarlett, these are for you. Your favorite red roses.""

I took the flowers from him and brought them to my nose. I used to love the scent, but it made my stomach turn instead.

Declan stared at me. After a long silence, he finally spoke.

""Scarlett, Beatrice… has stomach cancer. The doctors say she doesn't have much time left. Her dying wish is to marry me. So…""

He hesitated for a moment. Then, he continued, ""I'm getting engaged to her in three days. You've always been so empathetic. I know you'll understand my reasons, right?""

I looked at him. He suddenly felt like a stranger. Was this really the man I had loved for five years?

Still, I nodded slightly. ""Okay.""

A flicker of surprise crossed Declan's face. Clearly, he hadn't expected me to agree so easily.

Then again, he used to say I was reckless, immature, and too possessive. I'd get upset any time a woman approached him. He claimed that I wasn't like other girlfriends—calm and understanding.

So, of course, he was surprised I didn't even get angry about him getting engaged to someone else.

Maybe he realized he had gone too far, because he kept explaining. ""Scarlett, I knew you'd understand. Don't worry. Once this is over, we'll get married. Beatrice only has a month or two left.""

I looked down at the roses in my hand, and a dull ache tugged at my chest.

""Okay."" I nodded again without the slightest hesitation.

Declan's gaze lingered on me, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. ""Thank you, Scarlett.""

Then, he stepped closer and reached for my face.

I pretended to put the flowers in a vase, just to avoid his touch.

Just hours ago, he had been holding Beatrice Porter's hand. I didn't want those same hands touching me.

On top of that, the smell of her perfume still clung to him, and it made me want to pull away.

Declan looked at me, clearly sensing my resistance. His brow furrowed in irritation as he called out, ""Scarlett?""

After all, I had never once pushed back against him in all these years.

""I'm tired,"" I said simply. ""I need to rest.""

I kept my head down and walked straight to the bedroom without looking at him.

Meanwhile, Declan stood there, staring at my retreating figure. All at once, his temper flared up.

""Why are you giving me an attitude? Didn't I tell you? Beatrice doesn't have much time left. Can't you just try to be a little more understanding?"" he snapped.

With that, he turned and stormed out.

As the door closed, I looked around the empty room. To my surprise, all I felt was calm.

I threw the red roses into the trash to accompany the cake Declan bought. Then, I began to pack.

Over the past five years, I had filled the entire house with things I'd bought. However, now that I had gone through it all, I realized I didn't have much worth keeping. I threw all the clothes, shoes, and bags into the trash.

As for the memories we shared, I didn't want them either.

Chapter 3

The next day, I walked into Declan's company and handed in my resignation.

My coworker, Ruth Collins, stared at me in disbelief. ""Scarlett, are you out of your mind? You're about to be promoted to Chief Technology Officer. If you quit now, all that hard work will go to waste!""

I smiled but didn't say a word.

The title was something I had spent years fighting tooth and nail to earn. But what did it matter now? Declan and I were done, and staying in his company just made me sick.

""I'm getting married soon. I'll probably help out at my husband's firm,"" I answered.

Ruth froze momentarily. Then, she broke into a smile. ""Oh! Well, congratulations! Speaking of weddings, Mr. Gibson is getting married, too. I can't believe he's engaged to Beatrice. But honestly, they do look great together.

""No wonder he always kept his distance from women. Turns out, he's in love with her. And I heard they've known each other since they were kids.""

She kept talking, but I turned and walked away. I couldn't bear to hear another word. Knowing that the man I had dated for years was about to marry someone else cut deep.

At that moment, the office door swung open. Declan walked in with Beatrice in tow.

Everyone stood as soon as they entered.

""Good morning!"" Beatrice greeted brightly. She looked radiant, nothing like someone who was supposed to be dying of cancer.

Declan wrapped an arm around her waist, smiling warmly. ""Let me introduce you all. This is Beatrice Porter. She'll be our new CTO.""

""Welcome, Ms. Porter,"" came a chorus of greetings.

Everyone gave her a warm welcome, except me. I stayed exactly where I was, completely still.

Right then, Declan's gaze landed on me. His expression darkened as he snapped, ""Scarlett Fletcher, did you not hear me introduce the new CTO? You can't even say hello?""

I pressed my lips together and remained silent.

Beatrice, on the other hand, smiled and extended a hand toward me.

""You must be Scarlett. Declan has told me about you,"" she began. ""Looks like we'll be working together now. Be kind to me, okay?""

I stared at her outstretched hand and felt nothing but provocation in the gesture. I had worked for years to earn that CTO role, but the moment she joined the company, it was handed to her on a silver platter.

It felt like a slap in the face. In Declan's eyes, I had never been the one he truly favored.

Then, Beatrice leaned in close and whispered, ""Oh, Scarlett. You dated Declan for years, and he never once introduced you to anyone. He never loved you. If you know what's good for you, get out of here.""

Having said her piece, she pulled back. The sweet smile was still plastered on her face. It was as if we were close friends.

""Scarlett, your earrings are gorgeous,"" she commented, as though she had just leaned in to admire my jewelry and not to deliver a warning.

Declan tugged her back to his side, saying, ""No need to be that polite to a regular employee. Those earrings are just cheap knock-offs. They're nothing worth complimenting.""

With that, he wrapped an arm around Beatrice's waist again and walked off.

…

Meanwhile, I stood there with my hand suspended. I felt like a fool.

I lowered my head, pulled my hand back, and tightened my grip on the resignation letter.

I pressed my lips together and turned to leave. Since I had already made up my mind, his approval didn't matter anymore.

I had just reached the door when I heard a panicked voice behind me.

""Declan, what do I do? My necklace is missing!""

It was Beatrice. She looked frantic, clutching a fancy gift box. ""I swear I left it right here! How could it just disappear?""

Every morning, I had to decide: brew a full pot or just a single cup? My old coffee maker didn’t give me options—it was all or nothing. And on busy weekdays, that meant wasted coffee or no coffee at all. That’s when I discovered the [Hamilton Beach 2-Way Programmable Coffee Maker](https://amzn.to/4mTPR5S).

It promised flexibility, convenience, and quality—and with **over 45,000 customer reviews**, I figured it had earned its reputation.

# 🔍 First Impressions

The coffee maker looked sleek in black, with a clean interface and a sturdy build. What stood out immediately was the **dual brewing system**:

* **Single-serve side** for quick cups using ground coffee (no pods required)
* **Full 12-cup glass carafe** for weekends or when guests are over

It also had a **programmable timer**, **auto pause and pour**, and a **keep-hot plate**—everything I needed to streamline my mornings.

# ☕ Brewing Both Ways

I tested both modes:

* On weekdays, I used the **single-serve side** to brew a quick cup before heading out. It was fast, clean, and tasted great.
* On weekends, I programmed the **carafe side** to start brewing before I woke up. The aroma filled the kitchen, and the coffee was ready when I was.

The **auto pause and pour** feature let me sneak a cup mid-brew without spills, and the **water reservoir window** made filling it a breeze.

I call it **GramGrid**.

The goal is to fit the letters of four 4-letter words into a 3x3 grid. The trick is that the words must fit into the four 2x2 corner blocks, and the row and column totals of the letter values (A=1, B=2, etc.) must match the puzzle targets.

It's a novel coffee-time brain-training exercise that would suit any addicted puzzler.

**The Story Behind GramGrid:** 

A lifetime of enjoying puzzles led me to wonder about creating my own. I had written some puzzles for a friend who was very ill. After he died I still had the urge to create a puzzle. I scratched out a prototype for my partner to solve, and that's when I knew I was on to something.

It was a challenge to develop, especially the technical side, so I enlisted some help from AI coding tools. I've now turned it into a completely free, mobile-friendly app.

**Key Features of the App:**

* A new, freshly baked puzzle every day.
* Absolutely **no ads, cookies, or tracking.**
* Available for iOS and Android.

**Try It For Free:**

* **Play the puzzle app:** [gramgrid.net](https://gramgrid.net/)
* **Read about how I created it:** [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@mrtjones/idea-on-paper-to-a-pwa-a-2-month-ai-journey-ac079dfffa6c)

1mwzsok,https://i.redd.it/z6sxm0wnuikf1.jpeg,"Looking for a light, airy, down to earth scent","Hi all, 

I’ve tried to collect the essence of what I like. I like to be active and connected to my surroundings. Meet friends and enjoy the time with them, but I also love time alone and peace. 

My ideal relaxing place is within nature, a tree rustling in the wind, bees humming, wildflowers blooming. A good book to go with it and depending on the daytime a glass of wine or coffee. 

White is my favorite color, which I wear a lot, too. I like natural fabrics and textures, and like to be comfy. 

I am very curious what you come up with!

1mwzrrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexandthecity/comments/1mwzrrb/ive_got_something_i_really_want_to_say_about_ajlt/,"I've got something I really want to say about AJLT, but it is SATC related, so I hope it's okay to post, ""How I would have written ""And Just Like That...""""","I need to get something off my chest and there’s no pressure to read all this, but I spent a lot of time writing it...a little feedback, but especially how I would have written the reboot myself and I just wanted to share it.

Now, I will hold my hands up to not having been a fan of AJLT.  In a nutshell, I felt it was saying, *“We need to prove we’re inclusive!”*

Instead of trusting its core characters, it bolted on new ones to tick boxes — and the result felt preachy, inorganic and insulting to the intelligence of the audience who grew up with “*Sex And The City*”.

* **Woke Overload:**  Heavy-handed attempts at inclusion (Che, Dr. Nya, LTW, Rock’s non-binary storyline) that weren’t organically developed.  They felt like “message delivery systems,” not people.
* **Character Betrayal:**  Miranda suddenly awkward, bumbling and desperate to be “hip”.  Carrie suddenly clueless about tech.  Charlotte reduced to broad sitcom parenting beats.  Samantha written out with a petty fight and real character assassination.
* **Tone Mismatch:**  Preachy, clunky, joyless.  The wit and sparkle of SATC was replaced with clumsy lectures about modern issues.

As a fan, I felt insulted and even people who *wanted* inclusivity hated the way it was executed, because it was caricature instead of story.

So, I wanted to rewrite it.  I know pointlessly, because they’re not about to go back and do it again, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

* **Inclusion Through Authenticity:**  Instead of bolting on new “sidekick” characters, I let the diversity of the world show through guest stars; clients, dates, colleagues and background.  They’re not *main characters shoehorned in* — they’re organically part of the City.
* **Respect for Core Four:**  Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, Samantha are written *in character*.  Their arcs grow out of who they always were — flawed, witty, self-sabotaging — but now facing real late-life battles (divorce, grief, regret, career reinvention, etc).
* **No Pandering:**  Modern discourse without clunky lectures.  Instead, themes like regret, estrangement and reinvention are timeless and the City’s natural diversity can still appear without being didactic.
* **Emotional Truth:**  It centres on real emotional stakes — Harry’s death, Carrie’s humiliating failure, Miranda’s career restlessness, Samantha’s estrangement.  These aren’t gimmicks; they’re Human.
* **Tone Restored:**  The biting wit, glamour and observational humour are back.  Carrie’s voiceover lines are sharp, not cringe.  Miranda retains her cynicism and intelligence.  Charlotte is grieving, but dignified.  Samantha is untouchable and respected.

**PREMISE**

Nearly 60, the women of *Sex and the City* find themselves facing life’s hardest truths in a city that now feels younger, faster and less forgiving.

Carrie is divorced from Big and humiliated: her love-life memoirs tanked, her publisher dropped her and she’s back in her old apartment.  No magazine, no book deal, no man.  Once a voice of her generation, she’s now regarded as a has-been in an era where women tell their stories through podcasts, not columns.

Miranda, still happily married to Steve (with passion intact), feels professionally restless.  She left the battlefield of big law for a softer firm and regrets it.  Her marriage works; her career doesn’t.

Charlotte’s worst nightmare comes true when Harry dies of cancer.  He leaves her and the girls financially secure — Harry was smart and loving — but Charlotte, whose identity was bound to family perfection, suddenly faces a future she cannot control.

And Samantha? Thriving in London running her PR empire, she has self-respect enough never to look back.  The estrangement was born entirely of Carrie — with Miranda and Charlotte siding against her — after Samantha chose London over New York.  Samantha won’t forgive them, won’t listen and won’t open the door again.  Her absence is the wound at the centre of the series.

**Episode 1 – “The End of the Fairytale”**

**COLD OPEN – New York Morning**

* **Carrie VO:** *“When I first came to New York, everyone was chasing two things: a dream job and a soulmate.  Now, everyone’s chasing Wi-Fi and collagen.  And just like that, I had become… outdated.”*
* Cut to: Carrie, 59, lugging boxes up the staircase of her old brownstone.

**SCENE 1 – Carrie’s Apartment, Day**

* Surrounded by boxes of unsold books.  Carrie’s agent on speaker.

* Carrie stares at her old hardcovers, once shiny, now remaindered.

**SCENE 2 – Miranda & Steve’s Kitchen, Morning**

* **Harry:** “…you to breathe.”
* Guests arrive — Carrie, Miranda, Steve, a Black couple from Lily’s school, a gay couple from temple.  Charlotte beams with brittle hospitality.

 **Episode 3 – “The Widow and the Failure”**

**COLD OPEN – Charlotte’s Kitchen, Morning**

* Charlotte lines up pillboxes, labels leftovers, color-codes the girls’ schedules.  Grief disguised as control.
* Lily purposely puts a fork on the “wrong” side of a plate.  Charlotte breathes deeply instead of snapping.
* **Carrie VO:** *“Some women cry.  Some drink.  Some have affairs.  Charlotte bought a label maker.  Because sometimes grief isn’t tears — it’s tabs.”*

**SCENE 1 – Publisher’s Office, Day**

* Carrie pitches a new book: essays on starting over.
* **Editor (young Latina, warm but firm):** “You once sold romance.  Now you’re selling regret.  And regret doesn’t move units.”

**SCENE 2 – Street Corner, Day**

* Carrie spots Big.  He sees her this time.

* Guest: “He’s in a better place.”

* She smiles, thoughtful.

**SCENE 7 – Trio Walk, Dusk**

* Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte walking through Central Park.
* Miranda: “They’ve asked me back temporarily.”
* **Charlotte (snapping):** “At least you have a job.” Immediate regret.

**SCENE 8 – End Beat, Carrie’s Apartment, Late**

   * *Money*
   * *Voice*
   * *Samantha*

* Three women, each on the brink.

 **Episode 4 – “Law & Disorder”**

**COLD OPEN – Courthouse, Morning**

* She’s crisp, lethal, every line a blade.  The jury leans in, impressed.

**SCENE 1 – Firm Hallway, Later**

* Partners swarm Miranda.
* **Partner 1:** “Brilliant work.  We couldn’t have done it without you.”
* Then they trot the male rainmaker in front of cameras.
* **Miranda (dry):** “I’ll be sure to cc him on my next victory.”
* She storms out, seething.

**SCENE 2 – Trendy Podcast Studio, Afternoon**

* Carrie appears as a guest on a millennial dating podcast run by two young queer hosts.
* Host: “So, Carrie Bradshaw — is dating over sixty even a thing? Or is it just brunch with Metamucil?”
* The audience laughs.  Carrie tries a wry comeback, but it falls flat.
* The clip later goes viral: “Grandma Bradshaw Bombs on Air.”

**SCENE 3 – Gallery Visit with Charlotte & Lily, Day**

* Lily drags Charlotte to see a new downtown gallery.
* Art is raw, messy, provocative.  A young Black woman artist explains her work with unapologetic confidence.
* Charlotte is flustered, pearl-clutching.
* **Charlotte:** “It’s… very bold.”
* Lily: “It’s honest.”
* Charlotte impulsively buys a piece: “For the house.”

* Carrie, humiliated, walks out.

**SCENE 6 – Firm Drinks, Night**

* Miranda raises a glass.
* **Miranda:** “To my victory you’re taking credit for.”
* She drains it, slams it down, walks out into the rain.
* Steve is waiting outside with an umbrella.  He just smiles: “Knew you’d come out swinging.”

**SCENE 7 – Carrie’s Apartment, Night**

* Carrie rereads her letter to Samantha.  She can’t tear it up.  She tucks it into a drawer like a relic.
* **Carrie VO:** *“Sometimes the grown-up thing isn’t forgiveness.  It’s restraint.”*

**SCENE 8 – Miranda & Steve’s Bedroom, Late**

* Miranda stares at the ceiling, restless.
* **Miranda:** “I’m winning the wrong game.”

* **Miranda:** “I’m not here to babysit patriarchy.  Thanks, but no thanks.”
* She storms out, exhilarated but terrified.

**SCENE 2 – Charlotte’s Closet, Afternoon**

* Charlotte opens Harry’s closet with donation bags.  She touches a suit jacket, crumbles to the floor.
* Lily and Rose find her clutching one of Harry’s ties to her chest, sobbing.
* The three cry together, tangled in clothes.

**SCENE 3 – Jazz Bar Sidewalk, Dusk**

* Carrie runs into Big outside a jazz bar.
* They share awkward, polite banter.

* Carrie lingers, gutted.

* Carrie sets up her mic, breath steady.
* She records the episode: *“The Friend I Lost.”*

* She hits publish.

**SCENE 2 – London, Afternoon**

* Samantha sits in her sleek flat, overlooking the Thames.
* A young assistant hands her phone: “This went live today.”

* She doesn’t call.

* Carrie’s episode spreads.
* A 50-something Black grandmother in Atlanta nods along.
* A South Asian woman in London listens on her commute.
* A Latina CEO in Miami clicks “subscribe.”

**SCENE 7 – Final Walk, Night**

* Carrie walks alone through Manhattan.
* Lights blur, heels click, crowd swallows her.
* **Carrie VO (closing):** *“Maybe life isn’t about happy endings.  Maybe it’s about the parts that don’t end at all — friendship, grief, hunger, hope.  And just like that… I was still me.”*
* She turns a corner and disappears into the city.

1mwzrku,https://www.reddit.com/r/deodorant/comments/1mwzrku/does_sweat_affect_your_social_life_heres_how_to/,Does Sweat Affect Your Social Life? Here’s How to Stay Fresh Around Others,"Let’s be honest—sweat happens. It’s totally natural. But when sweat turns into body odor, it can make social situations awkward. Whether you're in a crowded meeting, on a first date, or just catching up with friends, that nagging worry—“Can anyone smell me?”—can kill your confidence.

 

Maybe you’ve experienced it before: standing in line for coffee, noticing a familiar scent on your sleeve, or suddenly realizing your armpits feel damp during a presentation. These small moments can snowball, making you hyper-aware of your body and how others perceive you. It’s easy to let sweat—or the fear of it—affect your mood and social confidence.

 

But here’s the good news: you don’t have to let sweat (or body odor) take over your social life. With a few smart steps, you can stay fresh, feel confident, and enjoy your day—worry-free. This guide will break down why sweat smells, how it affects confidence, and actionable strategies to stay fresh with ease.

 



 

# Why Does Sweat Smell?

Sweat itself is mostly water and doesn’t actually smell. Body odor happens when sweat mixes with bacteria on your skin, especially in warm, enclosed areas like your underarms. The bacteria break down sweat into acids, which creates that familiar scent.

 

Several factors can make odor more noticeable:

* **Stress**: Emotional stress triggers apocrine sweat glands, producing sweat rich in proteins and lipids that bacteria feed on.
* **Diet**: Strong-smelling foods like garlic, onions, or red meat can intensify body odor, while fruits, vegetables, and plenty of water help keep it balanced.
* **Clothing**: Tight or synthetic fabrics trap sweat and bacteria, increasing odor.

 

Women’s body odor can also fluctuate due to hormonal changes—during your period, ovulation, or high-stress days. Even if you’re not sweating a lot, these changes can make your natural scent more noticeable.

 

Understanding the science behind sweat and body odor is the first step to managing it effectively. Once you know why it happens, you can take proactive steps to minimize it without relying on masking scents alone.

 

 

# 😬 How Sweat Affects Social Confidence

Body odor doesn’t just smell—it can affect how we act around others. Many women find themselves:

* Avoiding raising their arms in public.
* Worrying about hugging someone too closely.
* Changing outfits multiple times just to “feel clean.”
* Keeping perfume in a bag like a lifeline.

 

These behaviors are subtle ways our bodies and minds respond to the anxiety of smelling bad. Over time, this constant worry can erode confidence and make social interactions less enjoyable.

 

Here’s the good news: you don’t need to rely on perfume alone or avoid social situations. With the right strategies, you can feel fresh, confident, and in control—no matter what your day throws at you.

 



 

# How to Stay Fresh—So You Can Focus on What Really Matters

**1. Shower Daily (or Twice if Needed)**

A clean start is essential. Especially after workouts, outdoor activities, or long workdays, a gentle shower helps remove sweat, bacteria, and odor-causing compounds. Use a body wash that cleanses without stripping your skin of natural moisture.

* Focus on sweat-prone areas: underarms, back, and feet.
* Use lukewarm water to avoid over-drying.
* Consider exfoliating 1–2 times a week to remove dead skin cells that trap bacteria.

Even a quick shower in the morning or after exercise can make a noticeable difference in how you feel and smell throughout the day.

 

 

**2. Switch to a Natural Deodorant That Actually Works**

Not all deodorants are created equal. Look for products made with **plant-based ingredients** that fight odor and soothe the skin—like baking soda alternatives, magnesium, zinc salts, or coconut oil.

(👉 Try [ATOMFRESH deodorant balm and cream](https://www.atomfresh.com/collections/deodorants)—they’re aluminum-free, skin-friendly, and designed to keep you fresh all day.)

 

**Tips for choosing the right deodorant:**

* **Balm**: Smooth texture, ideal for oily or combination skin.
* **Cream**: Extra nourishing, perfect for dry skin.
* Check for natural emollients and soothing plant extracts to reduce irritation.

By switching to a natural deodorant, you’re not just masking odor—you’re preventing it at the source while caring for your skin.

 

 

**3. Wear Breathable, Natural Fabrics**

Synthetic fabrics trap heat and sweat, which can worsen odor. Instead, choose:

* **Cotton**: Soft, breathable, and absorbs moisture.
* **Linen**: Lightweight and cooling, perfect for hot days.
* **Loose-fitting styles**: Allow air circulation and reduce friction.

Even small changes, like wearing a cotton blouse instead of polyester, can help you feel fresher and more comfortable throughout the day.

 

 

**4. Keep a Mini Kit With You**

Long days out? Carry a small kit to refresh when needed:

* [Travel-sized deodorant](https://www.atomfresh.com/products/mini-deodorant-starter-set)
* Wet wipes
* Spare top or scarf

This small routine can save you from panic moments and make a big difference in confidence during busy schedules, meetings, or social events.

 

 

**5. Hydrate and Eat Fresh**

Your diet directly influences how your sweat smells. Some simple tips:

* **Limit strong-smelling foods**: garlic, onions, red meat.
* **Increase fruits and vegetables**: their high water content helps dilute odor compounds.
* **Drink plenty of water**: hydration helps your body flush toxins efficiently.

Balanced nutrition not only improves sweat odor but also contributes to overall skin health, giving you that fresh, confident feeling inside and out.

 

 

# 💬 Real Talk: Everyone Sweats. But You Deserve to Feel Confident

Sweat is normal—but constantly worrying about it doesn’t have to be. With daily hygiene, smart product choices, breathable clothing, and proper hydration, you can go from:

>

Everyone sweats, but managing odor is completely within your control. And the right products make it easier.

 

 

# Bonus Tips for Staying Fresh All Day

* **Layer light fragrances**: If you enjoy perfume, use it on clothes rather than skin to avoid mixing scents with sweat.
* **Rotate workout clothes**: Bacteria can linger on fabrics; clean clothing prevents odor buildup.
* **Use gentle, fragrance-free laundry detergents**: Harsh chemicals can irritate skin and worsen odor.
* **Mind your stress levels**: Practice quick mindfulness or breathing exercises—stress-induced sweat can be more odorous.

 

 

# FAQ – Quick Answers

**Q1: Can natural deodorants really work all day?**  
Yes. Products like AtomFresh deodorant balm and cream use ingredients that neutralize odor naturally while protecting sensitive skin.

 

**Q2: What if I sweat a lot during workouts?**  
Reapply your travel-sized deodorant after exercise, shower when possible, and wear breathable fabrics.

 

**Q3: Can sensitive skin use natural deodorants?**  
Absolutely. AtomFresh products are free of aluminum, parabens, and baking soda alternatives that reduce irritation.

 

**Q4: Does diet really matter for body odor?**  
Yes. Hydration and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables help balance body chemistry and reduce odor intensity.

 

 

# Real-World Confidence Boost

Using these strategies, along with [AtomFresh products](https://www.atomfresh.com/collections/deodorants), makes it easier to:

* Give presentations without worrying about armpits.
* Enjoy close social interactions without hesitation.
* Travel, exercise, and attend social events while staying fresh.

Your daily routine can become less about managing sweat and more about enjoying life.

 

 

# Take Action Today

2025 Guide for Foreign Investors, Startups & Corporates\
\
Alt text: Business people in a professional corporate meeting, symbolizing Bahrain Financial Harbour's dynamic business scene. and a 2025 Reuters economic outlook, the kingdom’s GDP expanded by 4.1% in Q1 2025, and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows hit a record USD 1.7bn last year. The Bahrain Bay project and Seef District’s tech accelerators constantly buzz with multinational teams. Why? Because Bahrain’s government has built a pro-business environment with zero corporate income tax for most companies, a flat 10% VAT, and a regulatory system designed to woo foreign investors.\
Still, even in this low-tax paradise, deadlines matter. The Economic Development Board (EDB) has been swift in rolling out digital platforms—like Sijilat—for company formation and compliance. Yet, handling VAT and social insurance filings demands sharp timing and local know-how.\
And while Dubai and Riyadh often steal headlines, Bahrain’s fast set-up, 100% foreign ownership (in many sectors), and transparent fee schedules give it a unique edge. (My experience with Keylink’s Bahrain company formation packages was smoother than my attempts in the UAE—especially when paired with a reliable local consultant who knows the MOICT’s quirks.)\
Recent 2025 Developments Impacting Tax Filing Deadlines\
Importantly, a February 2025 Cabinet decree shifted the VAT annual return filing deadline from March 31st to April 30th for all entities, including those formed under Bahrain Free Zones. The LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority) also reduced the grace period for social insurance filings to 20 days post-payroll. These changes came into effect on March 1, 2025, and affect every company, whether in the Diplomatic Area’s glass towers or a boutique consultancy in the Bab Al Bahrain old souq.\
Small tangent: I once spent two hours in a majlis-style meeting at a Diplomatic Area consultancy—where business was discussed after a round of Arabica coffee, just as tradition dictates. While it felt slow, that casual talk yielded an insider tip: always double up copies of your tax filings so the Sijilat officer can stamp the extra set for your records. It’s saved me heartache more than once.\
Understanding Bahrain Taxation: What Must Companies File, and When?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, symbolizing team discussions on Bahrain company tax strategies..\
* VAT (Value Added Tax): Standard rate at 10%. Companies crossing the BHD 37,500 mandatory threshold must register for VAT and file returns.\
* Social Insurance: Mandatory monthly filings and payments.\
* Economic Substance filing: For relevant activities (often finance, holding, or IP companies).\
Let’s break down the deadlines:\
1. VAT Filing Deadlines (2025 Update)\
\
Quarterly VAT filers: File by the last day of the month following each quarter (e.g., Q1 deadline: 30 April 2025).\
Annual VAT filers: New in 2025! Annual filers must submit returns by 30 April—extended from the previous March deadline.\
Late Filing Penalties: BHD 50 minimum penalty for each late return, plus daily cumulative fines.\
\
2. Social Insurance Deadlines\
\
Monthly filing and payment: Due by the 15th of each month for the previous month’s payroll.\
Tip: Many Seef District offices use the LMRA e-support desks—arriving just after 10 AM avoids the long “morning rush” of agents.\
\
3. Economic Substance Filing\
\
Annual Notification: Within six months of entity’s financial year-end (e.g., 30 June for Dec 31 year-end).\
Full Return: Within 12 months of entity’s financial year-end.\
\
4. Audit and Financial Statement Submission\
\
Some business types (not all) must submit audited accounts to the MOICT.\
Deadline: Within 3 months of financial year-end (e.g., March 31 for December year-end companies).\
\
\
Pro tip: Schedule your board meeting for final sign-off after Ramadan hours resume—during Ramadan, government offices close much earlier, and queues at the Commercial Register (CR) in Exhibition Road can be daunting.\
\

\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, showing efficient VAT and tax filing workflow in Bahrain. for smooth reviews\
2. Access Sijilat and NBR (National Bureau for Revenue) Portals\
\
Register your company on Sijilat (if not already done)\
Use the NBR e-portal for VAT\
Multiple failed logins can trigger security holds—use a password manager\
\
3. Complete Your Filings\
\
VAT: Submit via NBR portal (quarterly or annually)\
Social Insurance: File via SI online system\
Economic Substance: Complete notification form, then full report as required\
\
4. Confirm and Archive Receipts\
\
Always download stamped receipts and filing confirmations\
Pro tip: physically stamp and sign a spare copy at MOICT or LMRA, especially at the Diplomatic Area service center, for extra peace of mind\
\
5. Schedule Reminders for Next Cycle\
\
Bahrain’s Tax Authority does not send reminders—missing a date leads to instant penalty postings\
\
\
Personal challenge: The first time I filed quarterly VAT returns, the NBR portal crashed just before the deadline. Solution: I set up my own calendar with three-day-early reminders and pre-loaded draft returns, giving myself a safety net against technical glitches.\

Cost Considerations: Filing Fees, Fines & Budgeting\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs in Bahrain company formation and tax filing.\
- Social Insurance Filing: No fees for filing—just your monthly contributions (typically 15% of gross salary, split between employer and employee)\
- Audit Preparation: BHD 500–1,000 for a small company; BHD 1,500+ for medium-sized entities\
- Professional Accountant/Tax Consultant: BHD 80–300/month retainer\
Planning tip: Most startups in Bahrain Bay budget around BHD 1,200–1,800 for annual accounting and compliance costs. (Check Keylink’s updated company registration cost table for sector-by-sector fees.)\
Avoiding Unnecessary Expenses\
\
File early: Avoid BHD 50–300 late filing fines\
Choose core office locations: The LMRA branch in Isa Town is quieter than the Diplomatic Area on peak days\
Prepare dual-language documents upfront: Saves hours of rework\
Bundle services: Many local consultancies offer package deals—choose all-in-one solutions to keep costs lean\
\
Bahrain Company Types & Their Regimes\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, company type discussions.\
   - Most common for SMEs and startups\
   - No mandatory annual audit for very small WLLs\
2. BSC (Closed or Public Shareholding)\
   - Annual audited accounts mandatory\
   - Must comply with more stringent reporting (popular in Bahrain Bay and Diplomatic Area)\
3. SPC (Single Person Company)**\
   - Quickest for solo expats or investors\
   - Filing process nearly identical to WLL\
Review the complete list of entity types and their tax implications. (I’ve seen entrepreneurs pick the wrong structure and end up with an expensive audit requirement—double check before registering.)\
And don’t forget: 99% foreign ownership is allowed in most sectors, with specialized activities for foreign investors.\
Insider Tips for Effortless Tax Compliance\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain tax filing.; there’s usually no queue.\
* During Ramadan, check Tamkeen’s business support hours in advance—officers leave early and patience is key.\
* Always bring a stamped coffee coupon—locals say it’s good luck for government paperwork days (I’m only half joking!).\
* Double up on all document copies. Officers sometimes ask for “one for the file, one for your records.”\
* Majlis-style meetings still happen—especially with older consultants. Bring patience, and always accept coffee when offered.\
Surprisingly, entrepreneurs often skip proper accounting and bookkeeping services to save on costs, only to face MOICT or VAT audits that could have been avoided for BHD 100/month.\
A frequent mistake: assuming your CR (Commercial Registration) renewal automatically triggers compliance updates. It doesn’t. Stay proactive and monitor your own renewal and filing cycles. If you’re unsure, professional business support is a lifesaver.\
Bahrain’s Advantage Versus UAE & Saudi Arabia\
Filing VAT returns in Bahrain beats the UAE’s overwhelming paperwork and Saudi Arabia’s stricter deadlines. Bahrain’s online portals are cleaner, and the MOICT support teams actually answer the phone (most days). Plus, with full foreign ownership, you skip sponsor negotiations—local sponsorship is rarely required except in sensitive sectors.\
The Role of Free Zones and Special Economic Areas\
Bahrain’s Free Zones (like BIIP and BLZ) offer customs duty exemptions and quick company setup. Tax obligations like VAT and social insurance still apply, but often with streamlined service desks. (BIIP’s admin team processed my last VAT registration in a single afternoon—no waiting.)\
Reliable Support: Who to Trust\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and customer service for Bahrain tax compliance.. They know Sijilat, EDB, and MOICT workflows inside out, and their bilingual accountants saved me from a costly social insurance misfiling in 2024. For sector-specific taxation, the official Bahrain portal is your definitive reference.\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & Tax Filing Deadlines\
1. What’s the biggest compliance mistake new Bahrain companies make?\
Often, founders assume that CR renewal means all compliance (tax, VAT, social insurance) is current. Wrong—each has its own cycle. Use automated reminders, or opt for a local accounting service to avoid slip-ups.\
2. Do tax deadlines shift during Ramadan or public holidays?\
Yes, operational hours at MOICT and LMRA change during Ramadan, sometimes causing bottlenecks. File early or use online portals where possible.\
3. As a foreigner, can I get 100% ownership in my Bahrain company?\
Absolutely, in most sectors as per 2025 EDB regulations—see full sector list.\
4. What’s the estimated annual compliance cost for a small company in Bahrain?\
Budget BHD 1,200–1,800 for all-in fees (audit, filing, advisory). Details at Keylink’s cost page.\
5. Can I handle Bahrain tax filings myself, or should I hire an expert?\
While solo handling is possible via Sijilat and NBR, most SMEs prefer local service providers for time savings and peace of mind. The rules do change fast, and expert help is always a good investment.\
\
Business in Bahrain rewards those who plan ahead, who respect local customs and timelines, and who keep one foot in tradition and another in digital best practice. After years running meetings in Bahrain Bay and queuing up at the Diplomatic Area’s MOICT counters, I say: file early, double-check everything, and always have an extra shot of qahwa on hand. The rest will fall in place.",1,1755846836.0,companysetupbh,1,1.0,False

1mwzj3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1mwzj3i/amphetamine_tongue/,Amphetamine Tongue,"I (24F) have been on Vyvanse 40mg for about 2 years.
My tongue is *constantly* white/yellow and cracked. Bleeds. I always brush my tongue and my teeth, so it isn’t like a “my gums bleed when I floss once a month, what’s the issue?!” situation. 
The kicker is, my mouth doesn’t ever really feel dry. 

Here is a general overview of my daily fluid intake.

-1 bottle of water when I wake up
-1 iced coffee made at work (fairly mild cold brew + oatmilk) 
-About 2 waters before lunch (sometimes a liquid IV or Gatorade instead of a second water)
-1/2-3/4 of an alani energy drink after lunch (idk why but if I have a canned drink I cannot make myself drink the last of it lol)
-1 water before end of work day
-3-4 waters by bedtime
-Usually wake up in the middle of the night and chug another water before waking up. 

I feel like everything I read about amphetamine tongue is from constant dry mouth, but I don’t feel like I have that. 

I do have a tendency to drink alcohol like a fish at night. 4-7 drinks. I’m scared of dehydration hangover so I always match my alcohol intake with water when I drink. But even on days with no alcohol it is no different!

Wise, or any payment company, they never tell you from whence the attempted theft came from.

#SUMMARY 
___



#Part Three


The unnamed narrator is a spirit; she is not missing her own body, but misses the contact of other people's bodies.  Her body is a memory, but memories are sometimes the most real of all.  The dead float around the people who love them.  The living hang on, the dead long to. 


**(15) Stella**

The police visit Stella and Jeff again to say they have found a victim, with evidence of sexual assault.  Even though she is finally believed, Stella doesn't feel smug, but intense rage.
She recalls a night where she, Lou and Paul were followed by a male driver.  Cheryl had called the police, and Kookoo had made tea.

Stella calls Kookoo, who sadly tells her about Emily.  On the night of the attack Stella had called the police, and then watched Emily get up, but did nothing; her kids were crying, she went to comfort them.

**(16) Lou**

Lou comforts Jake, immersed in his video game; he has been crying.  She remembers speaking to Luzia, who had two foster charges, Destiny and Cedar-Sage.  The girls had very different natures, and she identified more with Destiny, ready to fight, whereas Paul was more withdrawn, like Cedar-Sage.  Jake says he believes Emily and Ziggy went to Bishop's house, and enlightens Lou on what happens at these parties.

She takes Jake and Baby Boy to visit Emily at the hospital.  Cheryl is angry because the doctor wants to discharge her.  She claims that they don't care, in the same way they didn't care about her sister, believing she was just another drunk.
Paul gets a call from the police who are on their way.  Lou notices a change in Pete as he hears this.

**(17) Paul**

While Paul sits at Emily's hospital bed, the police question Emily about the party and her walk home.  Paul recognises that she's afraid and hiding something.  They ask her about Clayton, and Emily strongly denies that he did anything wrong.  Paul recognises the name and asks if it's Jesse Spence's boy, immediately regretting her words.

Paul had met Pete at a bar just over two years ago, and trusted him immediately, against her better judgement.  She tells Lou that she is aware that she believes Pete is guilty, and admits that it was her first thought too, however neither believe it now.  She continues to try to get the answer from Emily, but she is not ready to open up.

**(18) Stella**

Stella visits Kookoo, and finds her aunty Cheryl there.  They are pleased to see Stella's children.  She asks Kookoo if she'd consider moving into a retirement home; Kookoo says she can't leave.  Stella's childhood best friend Elsie, who would come for sleepovers, gave someone for Stella to be close to, as Lou and Paul had each other.  Elsie also lived with her grandparents, but when Else's grandfather died, Stella was shocked at how little it seemed to affect her friend.

The three sisters went to a party with Elsie at the ""Other Mike's"" house, where drugs and alcohol were in abundance.  Stella had seen Elsie head upstairs with the Other Mike, who she fancied, and when one guy announced that there was a girl who was ""just giving it away"", they went to investigate. They found Stella passed out on the bed being raped, with another guy getting prepared for his turn.  They screamed at them, but the guys just laughed.  They found out later that Elsie had gone to a home for pregnant girls, and one day Stella spotted her in the street; her eyes were expressionless and she didn't appear to recognise her.

**(19) Zegwan**

Ziggy recovers at home, and when she gets to visit Emily, her friend pretends to be asleep.  Her father and grandfather (Moshoom) come.  Her Moshoom speaks to her in their [native language.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2023029-eng.htm)  Ziggy remembers the time when her parents loved each other.  Sunny is no longer mad at his father and the presence of her family is comforting.  Her dad has a quiet chat to her about the attack, explaining why her mom is so affected.  He is reassuring, and she tells him she feels ashamed that she didn't do anything to help Emily.

Sunny chats to Ziggy and tells her that there is a possibility their mother will take them back to the reserve to live.  Ziggy reflects that she should have known better than to go to a gang party - Sunny had explained the two gangs, one red, one black, and how you show allegiance by clothing items that can be hidden.  Rita is upset when Sunny says he's going out, worried he'll seek revenge, and calls his father to follow him.  Ziggy notices the black bandana in his pocket, but doesn't tell her mother.

**(20) Tommy**

Tommy is tired and frustrated with the case, and wants to be credited with his work.  He discusses it with Hannah, who thinks it's hopeless, that the people involved are killers, rapists and drug dealers, but he has a feeling about a house.  Hannah doesn't try to understand, and he thinks his mother would have offered more insight.

He and Christie visit the rundown Selkirk property, with Christie taking the lead.  The place smells of disinfectant and incense, and a young Native man - Michael Hutchinson on his expired Native Status Card - and two young girls, Roberta and Angie, are there.  A young child is asleep.  Christie asks if they know anything about a girl who was attacked.  Tommy thinks the place seems a little too clean.  Their research shows the house is owned by a numbered company, and Angie Dumas, with a record, was a known associate of Alex Monias, street name Bishop, who had been in and out of prison.  The mug shot matches the man in the house.  There is still nothing to tie the attack to Bishop, and they review the victim's injury list which suggests several attackers.

**(21) Phoenix**

Bishop tells Phoenix she has to leave, and she doesn't argue.  As she heads out into the cold, Angie seems sad.  Phoenix tries to stay warm in a coffee shop until it closes.   Looking at her family photos, she thinks about Grandpa Mac, Grandmère, her mother Elsie, and her sisters Cedar-Sage and Sparrow, and the happy times before they moved out of the brown house.  Grandmère used to tell her stories of how she used to dress up for a trip into town, even though her Métis status prevented her from entering many of the shops.  Phoenix and her sisters were removed from their home due to Sparrow's father's violence.  She was separated from her sisters and missed her mother.

She walks past the brown house and pretends she still lives there.  Elsie was forced to leave when Grandpa Mac died. Grandmère grew up speaking French and was an expert at snaring rabbits.  Grandpa Mac was also Métis, but spoke English.   Phoenix remembers Grandmère calling her her favourite.  She sneaks into her uncle's house and hides down in the basement, reminiscing about the old, brown house.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Same Game Parlay Breakdown: Melbourne Storm vs. Canterbury Bulldogs (2025 NRL Round 25)**  
*Where the Storm’s home dominance meets the Bulldogs’ defensive sieve, and the odds are as clear as a Melbourne summer sky.*

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Let’s start with the cold, hard cash: **Melbourne Storm** are the bookmakers’ darlings, priced at **1.52** to win outright (implied probability: **65.8%**), while the **Canterbury Bulldogs** sit at **2.64** (implied: **37.9%**). The spread? The Storm are favored by **-6.5 points** (Bovada: **1.95**), and the total is set at **40.5 points** (Under: **1.83**, Over: **1.93**).

Key stats to chew on:

* **Melbourne’s home form** is as reliable as a coffee machine in Melbourne: **8-1 at AAMI Park** this season, with a +12.4 points per game for-and-against.
* The Bulldogs, meanwhile, are a team in transition. New playmaker **Lachlan Galvin** is “a piece of the puzzle” (thanks, Greg Alexander), but their defense has been leakier than a sieve left in a monsoon.

---

### Digest the News: Bulldogs Barking Up the Wrong Tree

The Bulldogs’ recent form reads like a horror movie: a four-point gap from the ladder leaders, a defense that’s “just not there” (per Alexander), and a new QB who’s still finding his rhythm. Their last outing? A limp 18-22 loss to Penrith, where they allowed 22 points to a Panthers side playing with a hangover from their circus-themed postgame party.

Melbourne, on the other hand, is the bear in its cave—unbeatable at home and hungry to secure a top-two finish. Their offense is clicking like a well-oiled gearbox, and their defense? Let’s just say they’ve been known to shut down teams faster than a barista says “extra shot, extra hot.”

1mwz9mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_VirtUsProtocol/comments/1mwz9mh/where_does_the_money_in_crypto_actually_come_from/,Where Does the Money in Crypto Actually Come From?,"Let’s figure out where the money in cryptocurrency actually comes from. Many market participants still don’t understand how money enters crypto: why do some people make money while others lose it? Where does the money come from at all? It can’t just appear out of thin air… Although — in reality, it actually can. And that’s a very accurate observation. If we go back to the topic I raised in the first post: crypto — like any financial market — is a “player versus player” game. There’s no such thing as everyone making money. At best, one person profits — because someone else must lose. A simple example is poker. Four players sit at the table, each puts in $100. In the end, one of them wins and takes the entire pot — the money of the other three.

In other words, this is a zero-sum game: if someone made money — it means someone else lost it. Cryptocurrency works exactly the same way. Moreover, this is the very same logic that applies to the traditional financial system — the stock market, equity markets, and so on. If someone profits, someone else must incur a loss. Money doesn’t just get printed out of nowhere. There’s no such thing as everyone profiting at once. Let me remind you about the flow of money: it always moves from the bottom to the top. Meaning, over the long term, it’s typically the big players at the top who profit — they take money from those at the bottom. Of course, there are times when retail investors can make money — in fact, nearly anyone can profit for a while. But that only happens over short timeframes, to give people the illusion of control — the belief that they’re doing everything right, playing by their own rules, that they’ve somehow “cracked the system.” But eventually, the market takes it all back. The money flows right back to the top, to the dominant players. That’s the hierarchy of the current financial system we live in. And it works exactly the same way in traditional finance.

Yes, in the traditional financial system it’s the same — the only difference is that the “pyramid” is structured a bit differently. But private investors are always at the bottom. Here’s another important idea: the market is a mechanism for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. This phrase, if I’m not mistaken, was said by Warren Buffett — and it’s absolutely accurate. What does it mean? Money “flows” from those who want to get rich quickly and easily to those who are willing to invest for the long term, build capital over time, and patiently wait. This is one of the fundamental laws of all financial markets. And this is exactly how large players make money — by selling “easy” ways to get rich quickly to the majority of retail investors. Do you think big exchanges, investment funds, or crypto projects aren’t spending on marketing to paint a beautiful — but false — picture for people? Of course they are. They create the illusion that it’s easy to make big money in crypto. What are they promoting? Meme coins, “promising” altcoins, new launchpads, hyped-up projects — and they market all of it as “accessible to everyone.”

Arbitrage, “signal” groups, financial pyramids — all of it targets one simple thing: the human desire to get rich quickly and easily. And what does that lead to? It means that money ultimately flows to those who are patient, who play the long game. That’s why I’ll repeat again: the market can be broadly divided into two categories — speculators and investors. Speculators want to get rich fast. Investors want to get rich forever. And here’s a crucial idea: you shouldn’t aim to get rich quickly — you should aim to get rich permanently, steadily, step by step, growing your capital throughout your life. If you do that, the money of most retail investors — who are almost all speculators — will naturally flow into your pocket. And you won’t even have to do anything special to make it happen. That’s how simple the pattern is.

And the majority of retail investors — they’re speculators. Their money naturally flows into the pockets of more patient market participants. You don’t even need to do anything for that to happen. The entire mechanism is simple: those who want quick profits willingly give their money to those aiming to build lasting wealth — long-term investors. Maybe you’re thinking, “I’m smarter than the rest. I’ll outsmart the system, make some quick gains, and exit the market.” There are people like that. Maybe you are one of them. But if you’re playing crypto by someone else’s rules — it won’t work. Those fairy tales about making 10x, 20x, 50x — they’re traps. Getting rich instantly, easily, without effort — that’s a myth, promoted by those who profit from your greed and your losses. It’s like poker — but on a massive table. Millions are playing. And each one wants to take money from the other.

Imagine a game of poker — not with five or six people, but with 150 million players, each trying to outplay the others and take their money. You have to understand: every player has their own motivation, and everyone is here to make money. If you play by someone else’s rules, you’ll end up losing your money to those who play by their own. So let’s get back to the main question: where does the money in crypto actually come from? Why do some people profit while others lose? Why does market capitalization grow? Let’s say Alex earned $1,000 working at a factory. His first move is to buy Ethereum with the entire amount — based on a friend’s advice who swears that “you can make serious money in crypto.” Alex buys the ETH. But then the price drops — because on any financial market, assets can fall in value, and this can happen for countless reasons: global news, shifts in sentiment, anything. Alex panics, can’t handle the drop, and sells his Ethereum for $500 — losing half of what he invested. Why? Because he wanted to get rich quickly and easily. It didn’t work. The market went down, and Alex decided it was all a scam, concluded that you can’t make money “doing nothing,” called crypto a fraud, and went back to his factory job. But here’s the key point: what actually happened? Alex left $500 of real money in the crypto market. That money didn’t disappear. It simply got redistributed among other market participants.

As a result, Alex left $500 in the crypto market — $500 of real money he earned working at the factory. He brought it into crypto, bought Ethereum, and then, frightened by the price drop, sold it at a loss. But that $500 didn’t just vanish — it was simply redistributed to other market participants. So Alex lost money, and someone else profited. Who exactly profited from Alex? First — the centralized exchange (like Binance or Bybit), which took commissions: for the deposit (for example, if Alex topped up his balance using a bank card), for buying Ethereum (usually 0.1–0.2% of the transaction amount), and for selling Ethereum (same story). All of that is pure revenue for the exchange. A small cut from each step — but in total, it adds up to a solid profit. And even if Alex left the market, the exchange still made money off him — without losing anything itself.

Next — the influencer. Or maybe it was just a friend who told Alex, “You can make some serious money in crypto!” He gave Alex his referral link — Alex registered through it, bought Ethereum — and the influencer received a cut of the trading fees. Why? Because the exchange shares a portion of its profits with those who bring in new clients. And as we already know, the exchange makes money on fees. That’s why it’s highly motivated to encourage users to bring in more users — the more transactions, the higher the revenue. The next one who profited from Alex was the advertising agency. Maybe Alex saw a banner ad online, a YouTube promo, or a sponsored tweet — and decided to give crypto a try, not because of a friend, but because of that marketing. The agency that ran the ad got paid — whether by the exchange, the project, or the influencer — it doesn’t matter. The agency still made money. Bottom line: even though Alex left crypto with a loss, along the way he fed the exchange, the influencer, and the advertising agency.

It’s possible that the exchange itself paid for the ad — for example, a banner placed on some website. That’s also part of the marketing budget aimed at attracting new participants like Alex. Other market participants who sold Ethereum to Alex also made a profit, because: They may have sold ETH at a higher price, And then, after the market dropped, bought it back cheaper. In the moment, this might not seem obvious, but over time, that’s exactly how it works: capital constantly flows from one participant to another. Someone earns — someone loses. Someone sells — someone buys. And the cycle repeats. Even those who sold ETH to Alex may profit later if they hold the asset long enough — days, weeks, months, or even years. That’s how the crypto market functions: capital doesn’t vanish — it’s redistributed. It moves from hand to hand, and over time, new money enters the system — when new participants bring in real fiat from outside sources like banks, salaries, businesses, and so on.

If someone comes from the outside — for example, from the traditional financial system — and brings real money into the crypto market, it leads to capital inflow and an increase in market capitalization. However, the core principle remains unchanged: the flow of money always moves from the bottom up. Retail investors hand over their money to those positioned higher in the financial hierarchy. I especially like this metaphor because it perfectly illustrates my main point: money always flows from the impatient to the patient. On a daily chart, there may be high volatility — the market can rise or fall sharply, and everything might seem unpredictable or even frightening. But when we look at a longer timeframe — years or even decades — it becomes clear that short-term fluctuations lose significance. That’s exactly why, in the end, long-term investors always take money from those who can’t wait and react emotionally and impulsively to every market move.

Anyone who wants to get rich quickly and easily through any financial instrument must first understand how the market actually works. Let’s imagine a situation: over the course of a year, Bitcoin grows from $20,000 to $45,000. While it rises from $20,000 to $25,000 — someone loses money, someone profits. Then it goes from $25,000 to $30,000 — again, someone loses, someone gains. And so on at every stage, with every price movement — someone is buying at a higher price, and someone else is selling more profitably. This is a classic zero-sum game: the total amount of money in the system doesn’t increase — one participant’s loss is another participant’s gain. If one person loses $100, it means someone else has earned that $100.

Of course, we have to take into account the fees collected by major players — centralized exchanges and other participants — but overall, the total amount of money in the system does not increase. In essence, no real value is being created — it’s simply a redistribution of capital. This is the fundamental logic of how financial markets operate, and it applies even to the stock market. For example, Microsoft stock might rise from $150 to $200, then to $250, $300, and so on — but at every stage, someone is losing while someone else is profiting. No additional value is being created in that moment. There’s no mechanism generating new capital, except through the losses of other market participants. Again and again: if someone earned money, it means someone else lost it. This is what defines a zero-sum game. However, there are arguments against this view — such as inflation and the growth of the money supply. Because the amount of money in circulation is constantly increasing, the system can give the illusion of capital growth.

Yes, the amount of dollars is constantly increasing — just like euros or any other government-issued fiat currency. That’s why capital invested in stocks, crypto, or gold can indeed grow over the long term. But not because someone necessarily has to lose and capital is merely being redistributed — rather, because the economy as a whole is expanding, and the money supply is increasing. As a result, assets with limited supply tend to rise in price relative to depreciating fiat currencies. The second argument is the creation of real value. For example, stocks of companies that pay dividends. I’ll go into more detail on this a bit later. Additionally, overall economic growth also influences both the crypto market and traditional financial systems — meaning they’re not entirely zero-sum games. It’s no longer just a poker table.

For example — the company Visa. It earns money by enabling transactions via bank cards, essentially providing the infrastructure for payments. In return, it collects a fee on each transaction. These revenues generate profit, which the company can then distribute to shareholders in the form of dividends. Moreover, Visa can use its profits to buy back its own shares, further increasing their value and injecting real capital back into a closed system. In this way, Visa’s business creates additional external value, since people genuinely use its services. The same logic applies to Ethereum. Ethereum is a platform for decentralized payments and applications. People actively use the network, build their businesses and decentralized applications on it, and pay fees to use the network. These fees (in ETH) are distributed among validators who maintain the network’s security. So, just like with Visa, this generates real economic activity and creates an internal economy driven by external demand. This is no longer a pure zero-sum game.

Then, the fees paid in ETH by network users are redistributed among those who secure the network — that is, to the stakers who have locked up their Ether and participate in transaction validation. This creates yield for supporting the network. At this point, we’re looking at the inflow of new capital and the emergence of a real economic model. Unlike many speculative tokens, Ethereum has objective value — it isn’t “inflated out of thin air.” Of course, the concept of value in crypto is largely subjective. Still, broadly speaking, any financial market by its nature functions as a zero-sum game. Imagine a situation where all investors suddenly decide to exit Apple stock and sell everything at once. If there are no buyers at that moment, the stock price will crash to zero. Everyone will lose their money. This logic applies to any asset — whether it generates profit or not, whether there’s a real product or not, whether it pays dividends or doesn’t — it doesn’t matter. If panic sets in and there’s no demand, any asset — stock, token, or cryptocurrency — can collapse to zero.

As for Bitcoin — I strongly recommend reading the book The Bitcoin Standard. This book will help you understand how Bitcoin fundamentally differs from the rest of the crypto market, how it differs from the traditional financial system, from Ethereum, and from other cryptocurrencies. It explains why Bitcoin holds a unique place in our modern financial ecosystem. It’s truly a foundational work — I consider it a must-read.

Now, let’s address the question: why do people buy stocks in the first place? In reality, the reasons are few. The first — is the hope of selling them at a higher price in the future. For example, you buy a stock for $100, and later find someone willing to pay $150. You make $50 simply because someone else was willing to buy the asset for more. In other words, you exit the market with a profit — but that profit is a direct loss for the next participant who bought from you.

The ability to sell an asset at a price higher than the purchase price applies to virtually all assets — stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other instruments. It’s only because there is a buyer willing to purchase your asset that you’re able to exit the market with a profit. But that profit is someone else’s loss. For example, you bought a stock for $100, and someone else later bought it from you for $150. The $50 difference is your profit — but it comes directly out of the next participant’s pocket.

The second reason people buy stocks is the desire to receive dividends from a company’s profits. Some investors are specifically interested in passive income — they hold shares in companies that consistently pay dividends. This is a perfectly reasonable strategy for long-term investing.

And finally, the third — and most important and reasonable — reason: preserving the purchasing power of one’s money. In a world where inflation is constant and the money supply keeps growing, investing becomes a necessity. It’s a way to protect capital from devaluation. Over the long term, the economy generally grows — and both the stock market and cryptocurrencies are well suited to help preserve capital value.

Why do people buy cryptocurrency? The reasons are virtually the same as for those who invest in stocks. The first reason is the hope of selling the asset at a higher price in the future. This is a speculative approach: you buy crypto today, sell it later at a higher price, and profit from the difference. The second reason is earning yield through staking, which essentially acts as the equivalent of dividends in traditional companies. By staking, you can receive passive income while holding coins within the network. And finally, the third — and most fundamental — reason: to preserve the purchasing power of money. Given the constant inflation and the expansion of the global money supply, cryptocurrency becomes a tool for many people to protect against devaluation. As for meme coins — they clearly demonstrate the mechanics of a zero-sum game. Unlike stocks of major companies, which can justify their value through business models, revenue, or inflationary protection, meme coins lack any fundamental basis. They are pure speculation: one person’s gain is exactly equal to another person’s loss.

Such products generate real profits for the company. These profits are then distributed as dividends among shareholders. That’s why we can say that the stock market is not exactly a zero-sum game: there is intrinsic value, a business model, demand for a product, profits, and, as a result, dividend payouts. The same logic generally applies to crypto. There is Bitcoin, there is Ethereum, and there are applications built on top of Ethereum — all of which create infrastructure and a certain degree of economic value. But meme coins are a completely different story. There’s no product, no revenue, no business model. There’s only hype, headlines, news, and community buzz. The profit of one meme coin holder directly depends on how much another person has lost. If I bought a meme coin for zero dollars and sold it for five — it means someone else bought it from me for five and now risks being stuck with that asset, unable to sell it even for one.

It’s the same story as with other assets — but here, there’s no underlying value. It’s purely speculative trading. And yes, it can work, but make no mistake — it’s all just a fairy tale. A fairy tale for whom? For those who want to get rich quick and easy. And who tells these stories? The big players — the ones who launch meme coins, the ones who run exchanges and make money from trading fees. And who actually determines the price of any asset — whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, a stock, or anything else? Is it a regulator? A centralized exchange? Someone else? No. It’s much simpler. Why is Bitcoin priced at $113,000? Because someone is willing to buy it at that price, and someone is willing to sell it at that price. At that moment, supply and demand met at $113,000 — that’s how a market works. The price of any asset is determined solely by supply and demand at a given moment in time. Yes, various factors may influence supply and demand — but the price itself is purely the result of how supply and demand balance among all participants at that specific point. Why, for example, did the token VIV or BCOIN on the Solana blockchain rise from 50 cents to $4.50? Because during that period, demand far exceeded supply. There was a flood of news, hype, paid advertising — and people were so eager to buy VIV that demand vastly outstripped the available token supply. That’s why the price surged to $4.50. This doesn’t mean there’s a solid technology behind VIV, nor does it mean that any asset needs a real product behind it. The only thing that drives price in the moment is supply and demand.

Here’s the translation: The next interesting question — who actually creates cryptocurrencies? Who launches meme coins, altcoins, and other projects? In reality, anyone can do it. Just like in the real world: any person can start a business — open a coffee shop, launch a movie theater, create a car-sharing service, or start a restaurant. These are just businesses built on top of the existing financial system. But in the traditional economy, you actually have to produce something, provide a service, create real value. In crypto, that’s not always necessary. It’s often enough just to promise a “cool technology” — and people are already ready to buy your token. Or you don’t even have to promise anything at all — just launch a meme coin. In short, anyone can create a cryptocurrency today. And that’s not necessarily an advantage — it’s simply a characteristic of the industry.

On the stock market, not every company’s shares are allowed to be listed on major exchanges or centralized trading platforms — there is a strict filtering process. But in crypto, everything is different: there are decentralized exchanges, and that is a fundamental distinction. Now let’s take a look at a typical lifecycle of a crypto project (or rather, 99% of crypto projects):

1.         A project idea emerges.

2.         A team is assembled to build and launch the project.

3.         Fundraising begins. This can include investments from venture capital funds or direct token sales to retail — meaning regular private investors. The project sells tokens that cost almost nothing to create, in exchange for USDT, USDC, ETH, or any other crypto asset that has real value.

4.         The token is then listed on major centralized exchanges.

5.         Finally, comes the exit: the team may start dumping their tokens at the peak of hype.

In this way, the project completes its full “cycle”: from idea to profit extraction. This scenario doesn’t apply to honest, fundamental projects — but this is exactly how 99% of outright scammy projects in crypto work.

Such scam projects are found literally at every step. That’s why the crypto space looks exactly like this. Why bother building a real business that generates actual profit, has a working product, and provides real value to people? That’s hard. It takes time. It requires effort and critical thinking. Why go through all that if you can just come up with a “project idea” — without creating a working business, without a product, without any revenue at all? Remember the movie The Wolf of Wall Street? There was a similar scheme — naive people were sold shares in supposedly “promising” companies that were allegedly about to do something revolutionary and amazing. The same exact model is working today — just in crypto. And it’s happening here and now. But the most important question you should always ask yourself is this: What are the major players really interested in? Or more accurately — not just the major ones. What motivates the creators of meme coins, altcoins, and any other crypto projects? What is their core interest? And does that list of interests include: “Helping you make money”?

I wasn’t thrilled about it, but I didn’t want to say no, so I agreed. The trip itself was fine, but we didn’t get to do much exploring or try much local food because my mom didn’t want to, which was a little disappointing. 

On the way back home, we arrived super early at the airport. Our flight was at 1:00 AM, but we got there by 5:00 PM because my older brother told my mom we should be early, even though I told her that we would be fine if we arrive at least 3 hours earlier before out flight. We just spent the time at a coffee shop and had dinner.

Around 9:00 PM, we checked in and went to the boarding area. By the time we got there, it was super crowded, and there were hardly any seats near the gate. I suggested we sit somewhere else near the screen, but she insisted on sitting near the gate. The only seat left was one by the door, and people were crowded around. She sat there while I moved to a less crowded gate. After about 15 minutes, she messaged me saying there was now a seat next to her, but I was still annoyed with her and didn’t respond.

An hour later, she passed by me on her way to the restroom. I couldn’t hear what she said, so I asked, “Huh?” but she just kept walking without replying. A few minutes later, I went to the restroom, and when I came back, I noticed she had messaged and called me, but I hadn’t seen it because I was in the restroom. By the time I came out, the boarding gate had opened, and I saw there was already a line. I started looking for her and eventually found her crying. I tried to explain that I didn’t hear her and couldn’t answer the call earlier, but she just kept saying, “I will never forget what you did to me, and I will never go on a trip with you again. Remember that!”

She said I ignored her messages and didn’t even acknowledge her when she passed by me. I tried to explain that I didn’t hear her and couldn’t answer her call, but she didn’t want to listen. She went into the boarding gate without speaking to me after that. She had all her documents, so she could still board the flight, and we were seated together on the plane.

I came back to the gate around 20 minutes before boarding so I was sure she won’t be left alone. It just so happened that I was in the restroom when the gates opened.

So, AITAH for ignoring her when she was upset and not sitting with her? Or was I just in the right to be annoyed at her overreacting?

Bro was a chronic redditor—like I could literally see him commenting everywhere. Then suddenly, by Feb his replies got slower… then radio silence. Last thing he said was “chud gaye guru” 💀 and after that—vanished. Not just from me, but looks like from Reddit too. His last comment was 5 months ago.

1mwz3rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1mwz3rg/can_you_pretty_please_type_me/,Can you pretty please type me? 🙏,"I’ve been researching the enneagram for *years* but I still can’t type myself! I see so much of myself in almost every type and I feel like my personality changes a lot, so it’s hard to pinpoint. 

Even my opinions change a lot. It’s hard for me to have a solid opinion on anything, yet when I do have an opinion, I can sometimes feel it super strongly, but then a few months later, my opinion on that thing can change. (But lots of times I have no opinions at all and I don’t feel strongly about anything at all). Even my therapist said I was the most contradicting client she’s ever had. 😭 Sometimes I wonder if I have a personality disorder because my sense of self is so off and I change so much, but I’m not diagnosed with any. So yeah, here’s my word vomit! Can anyone help please? 

I’m a 29 year old female diagnosed with social anxiety and autism. 

My social anxiety is kind of backwards in the sense I’m perfectly fine around strangers and big crowds, but get more and more anxious the longer I know someone. So my family (people I’ve known forever) see me as shy, closed off, quiet, only speaks when spoken to, reserved, monotone, etc. While my friends and strangers see me as lively, animated, funny, enthusiastic, flirty, loud, etc. Romantic relationships are hard too because I start off confident and flirty but slowly get more and more anxious/reserved as time goes on. Coworkers, I’m a weird mix between the two. Anxious with random spurts of confidence/silliness. Being silly/loud then instantly regretting it lol. Like my silliness wants to come out but I’m still holding back. 

I care too much about what people think of me. But I don’t care what strangers think of me, that’s why I’m not anxious around them. I don’t care if I stand out or if strangers think I’m weird/silly/loud. I’m never going to see them again, their opinions don’t matter to me. But the people in my life who I’m close to, I care about what they think about me. And their thoughts about me can influence my personal decisions, usually in an anxious way. Like, ‘I want to wear this shirt but I don’t know how my coworkers are going to react so I’m not going to’. I hold myself back a lot in fear of what others might think or say. But I’ve been challenging this a lot and purposely wearing things ‘out of the norm’ for me because I don’t want to be limited by other people’s judgements. I don’t want to stay small forever. I challenge my social anxiety a lot. I’m always doing new things despite my anxiety about making a fool out of myself (the main reasons I don’t do new things). 

It was only at around 20 years old that I realized I wasn’t authentic and actually stopped to evaluate myself and started introspecting to figure myself out. Now I’m too introspective lol. Anytime I have a problem, I can identify where the problem stems from, how it’s affecting me physically, what I’m feeling about said problem emotionally, all the possible solutions to fix it, and what each different solution might produce. I’ve had therapists tell me I’m doing their job for them and I don’t even need them 😂 I’ve also been told that I intellectualize my feelings instead of truly feeling them, and I have a fear of vulnerability. It’s frustrating when I notice myself repeating patterns because I know better, but just because I know better doesn’t mean I do better. 

I love meeting new people because it gives me the chance to ‘start over’. I’m not anxious about anything and I can be myself without fear of judgement. And there’s no one to, I guess, fact check me/my personality, because I’ve changed a lot over my lifetime and other people still bring up things that I may have said or did when I was younger but don’t agree with now. I just feel limited by other people’s perceptions of me. I hate being questioned about changes I’ve made about myself. Like going from a tomboy to a girly girl was tough because of all the questions/loud opinions of my family. I’m so tired of hearing the phrase “who are you and what have you done with (name)?” because I did something different than I normally do. So yeah, new people only have their current perceptions of you, no old perceptions. They aren’t going to interrogate me about my choices (unless they’re bad choices lol. But not because it’s different than my norm). 

I’ve been a people-pleaser for as long as I can remember. I always followed the crowd, I was never a leader. And I always tried to be who other people wanted me to be. I’ve always been a social chameleon, having different personalities around different people. And I hated parties and stuff for this reason. I never knew how to act and I got accused of being fake a lot because I acted so different around different friends. I was on auto-pilot and my auto-pilot was set to fawn, just doing and saying whatever the other person wanted to hear. I had a LOT of friends in elementary school, but my awkwardness and anxiety and trauma made me a super loner in high school. And I’m still somewhat of a loner now. I prefer having one ‘main’ friend instead of a group of friends. Relationship-wise, I’ve always been drawn to polyamory-open relationships. It sounds weird but there’s less pressure on me to ‘be the perfect partner’ in polyamory/open relationships. I always felt suffocated in monogamy. 

I also have a hard time owning up to my (small) mistakes because I don’t want people to think badly of me or scold me/lecture me about doing something wrong. But I can also own up to my mistakes very quickly because people respect that haha. So it’s not in an ‘always need to be right’ kind of way, more of an image/avoiding negative feelings kind of way. I also take mistakes so personally. I hate letting people down or disappointing people. That’s one of the worst feelings ever. I hate team sports because of this. I’m very much a team player, but I don’t want my failures to bring the whole team down. I beat myself up about it so much and it made me so anxious any time I was in team sports. I prefer solo or 1 vs 1 activities. 

I was/am really weird and strange. No matter how much I tried to fit in and be normal, there was always something off about me. And people point it out All The Time. (Probably the autism). And I hate it. Although everyone says being weird is a good thing because you’re embracing who you are, to me it felt like failure because no matter how much effort I put into being ‘normal’, I still failed. Plus, the people calling me weird aren’t saying it as a good thing, so even though the phrase they used isn’t inherently negative, their *intent* was negative. like someone calling you fat. Even though being fat isn’t a bad thing, the person calling you fat was intending to hurt you, so it still hurts, even when people reassure you that you’re still beautiful despite being fat. Same vibes lol.  Bullying sucks. Stop being asshats. 🖕

I got used and manipulated a lot growing up because I’m too nice and generous and giving, especially with money. I got used for money a lot. But it is my own fault too for Allowing myself to get used. I see red flags, then I ignore them lol. I never trust my gut. My gut says something and I do the opposite. (Again, it’s people-pleasing/fawning). I make this joke all the time in elementary school that I bought all my friends, but sadly, it’s probably true. My family wasn’t rich, but we weren’t poor either, and I think we were more ‘well off’ than my other friends/peers at school. Like, we had the only big house in the neighborhood. My dad’s in construction and built it himself, so I got labeled as the girl who lives in the big house. Then in high school I joked that I was everyone’s sugar daddy. Ironically, because I ‘bought’ my friends, I didn’t care as much about being judged or criticized by them. I could be my weird, silly self around them without anxiety because I was paying for a friendship, it felt transactional. Like a therapist. I pay you to listen to my problems and hang out with me, we’re both gaining from this. Paying for things and buying gifts is my main love language. It took a while for me to set firm boundaries when it comes to giving away my money. I have better friends now who don’t use me for money and it’s such a big difference experiencing true friendship vs fake/toxic friendships. I’m not used to being treated good haha. Usually i’m the one giving and they’re the ones taking, but my friends/partners are giving just as much as me and it’s wild. It’s sad but it truly feels foreign to be treated well and be taken care of instead of always being the one taking care of others. 

My whole life I’ve felt like a side character. I was born to lift people up and help people achieve their goals. I’m the perfect sidekick and cheerleader. People come to me with all their problems and I make it my life’s mission to help them. I drop everything to go to people’s aid. I’ve thought about becoming a therapist for this reason, but I also know I need lots of therapy/work of my own before I legit consider that. People have told me I’d be a great relationship counselor, because I’m good at solving relationship problems and helping people to get along. I’m great at finding compromises and middle grounds. 

Right now I work at a sex store, and I love my job. I’m very people oriented and customers love me because I’m very warm and welcoming. I’ve been told by so many people that I have a calming presence and they feel at ease around me. I’m good at calming other people’s storms (which I find odd because there are so many storms inside of me 24/7). So I’m anxious all the time, but other people don’t pick up on my anxiety. I’m good at masking. Or maybe in the moment I push my anxiety to the side to deal with the problem at hand, then my anxiety comes back once we’re in the clear? Idk. I’m equally calm and anxious I guess lol. Emotions are confusing (yet so interesting). 

I’m an ambivert, socially, in the sense that I can easily spend a week alone by myself no problem, but I could also spend everyday of the week doing things with people with no need for recharge. I’m down for anything, even if anything means doing absolutely nothing at all. Same with texting/calling, I can text/call multiple people all day, or not text/call anyone at all. If I’m not hanging out/talking with people, I’m usually playing video games, listening to music, scrolling social media, taking a walk downtown, getting coffee/treats or something, trying out new foods, shopping, etc. I also take a lot of naps and lay in bed a lot. I’m not very active. I walk a lot, but that’s it. I don’t run/jog, workout or do any sports. 

I feel like I wrote enough but I also feel like I didn’t write enough or the things I said aren’t useful at all haha. Let me know what you guys think! If you’re into MBTI too, can you let me know your thoughts on that as well? 🙊 (now I’m being greedy lol. But it doesn’t hurt to ask!)

Just had to rant I’m so sick of lactose free options being exclusively plant based options… it’s LACTOSE intolerance, many of us still like dairy it just doesn’t like us… 

Absolutely still provide plant based options for those who prefer it, are vegan, have dairy allergies ect- but is every place offering alternatives just completely ignorant to the fact lactose free milk exists????

Outside of things like coffee, shakes, ect ect…

Is there a reason companies cant make lactose free ice cream? I can’t stand plant based ice creams myself… Is it not possible? Do they hate money? Why?

Is lactose intolerance really this misunderstood… Do people think it’s the same as having an overall allergy to dairy?

300 acres already exploited for timber and is quoted 12 lakhs per acre 
300 acres remains unexploited and is 15 lakhs per acre .
Surprisingly the SR value of the property is 17.5 lakhs per acre .


   I have 2 buyers for the property but both of them want to cut down trees because the timber valuation covers half of the buying price.
I cant oppose the deal , i cant stop them from buying .

Since two days i am using chatgpt to help me find ways to buy this property but i didt get any solution.

    
   Anyone intrested to buy , i will support them with all of what i have for sure.

   If i had a way to get loan , i would have made the place heaven . convert (alienate)small portion of it to get more loan , donate 20 acres of land to some organisation like art of living or osho ashram and something like that .
But now deleting my own intrest , i dont want to be cruel enough to be a part of this madness.

## What is NexioWert?

NexioWert is an **automated trading platform** that uses AI technology to analyze market data and place trades on your behalf. Think of it as your personal trading assistant—one that doesn't sleep, panic, or get emotional when Bitcoin takes a nosedive.

The platform supports multiple asset types, including **cryptocurrencies**, **forex**, **commodities**, and even **stocks**. So whether you're a crypto enthusiast or prefer traditional markets, NexioWert has something for you.

What makes NexioWert different is its attempt to combine **ease of use** with **advanced algorithms**—a combo that’s often hard to find (most platforms lean too far in one direction).

## Who Created NexioWert?

There isn’t a huge amount of public info about the founders, which is pretty common in the world of automated trading platforms. But from what I’ve gathered, the platform was developed by a group of fintech and AI enthusiasts who previously worked on tools similar to **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**.

The team seems focused on creating a **transparent and beginner-friendly** trading experience. While I’d love more background on the actual developers, the platform itself seems to reflect a lot of thought and user-centric design.

## How Does NexioWert Work?

At its core, NexioWert uses advanced algorithms to **scan live market data**, identify trading opportunities, and execute trades automatically. You can also adjust the settings to be more or less aggressive depending on your risk tolerance.

Here’s a simplified breakdown:

- **AI scans the markets** 24/7
- You set your **trading preferences**
- The bot opens and closes trades based on real-time signals
- You can **monitor or override** any trade if you want more control

It’s built to minimize emotional trading and optimize entry/exit points. While no system is perfect, the automation saves time and reduces rookie mistakes.

## NexioWert Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real—no platform is flawless. Here’s what I like and what I think could be better.

**Pros:**
- ✅ **User-friendly interface** – Clean layout, easy for beginners.
- ✅ **Supports multiple asset types** – Not just crypto.
- ✅ **AI-driven trading** – Saves time and reduces human error.
- ✅ **Demo account available** – Great for practice.
- ✅ **Low entry barrier** – $250 deposit to get started.
- ✅ **24/7 customer support** – Helpful and responsive.

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Lack of transparency about creators** – Would love more info on the dev team.
- ❌ **Not ideal for advanced manual trading** – Limited tools for pro traders.
- ❌ **Market volatility still a risk** – The bot helps, but it’s not magic.

NexioWert is available in most countries, especially across **Europe**, **Asia**, **South America**, and **Australia**. However, it may be **restricted in the U.S., Canada, and a few Middle Eastern countries** due to local regulations.

If you’re unsure whether your country is supported, the best way to check is to try signing up—if it lets you complete registration, you’re good.

## NexioWert – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

One of the platform’s strongest features. NexioWert uses **AI-powered analytics** to track market trends as they happen. The goal is to identify the **best entry and exit points** based on volume, volatility, and price action.

This is especially useful if you don’t have time to stare at charts all day.

### User-Friendly Interface

No clutter. No complex setups. Just a clean dashboard that gets straight to the point. Everything from deposit to trade settings is **easy to navigate**, even if you’re brand new to trading.

Honestly, it’s one of the more **intuitive platforms** I’ve used (and I’ve tried a bunch).

### Mobile Accessibility

You can trade from your phone just as easily as from a desktop. The platform is **mobile-optimized**, so you don’t need to download any apps—just log in via browser and you’re good.

Perfect for checking trades while waiting for your coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

Set up **alerts** for price changes, trade execution, or market movements. It’s a great way to stay informed without needing to be glued to your screen 24/7.

You can even set alerts via email or push notifications.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Crypto is cool, but sometimes you want to diversify. NexioWert gives you access to:

- **Cryptocurrencies** (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.)
- **Forex pairs**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities**

A nice touch for anyone looking to spread out their portfolio.

## Is NexioWert a Scam?

Short answer: **No**. Based on my experience and what I’ve seen from others, NexioWert appears to be **legit**.

That said, always remember: **Every trading platform carries risk**, and no bot can guarantee profits. But NexioWert does work with **regulated brokers** and offers **SSL encryption** to keep your data safe.

I didn’t run into any red flags like blocked withdrawals or hidden fees—two major scam indicators.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on NexioWert?

To get started, you’ll need to deposit **$250**. That’s pretty standard for platforms like this (same as Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge).

You can use:

- **Credit/debit cards**
- **Bank transfers**
- **Some e-wallets**

It’s worth noting that this deposit is **your money to trade with**, not a fee.

### NexioWert Customer Support

NexioWert offers **24/7 customer service** via:

- **Live chat**
- **Email**
- **Phone (in some regions)**

I tried the chat feature and got a reply in under 5 minutes. The agent was helpful, not just copy-pasting from a script.

## How do you start trading on NexioWert?

It’s super simple. Here’s the 3-step process.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the NexioWert homepage and fill in your:

- Name
- Email
- Phone number

You’ll get a verification email right after.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once verified, you’ll be asked to make your **$250 deposit**. This goes into your trading balance.

Verification may include uploading a photo ID—standard compliance stuff.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding your account, you can:

- Use the **demo mode** to practice
- Set your **trading preferences**
- Go live and let the bot handle the trades

You can tweak settings any time or choose to trade manually.

## How to Delete a NexioWert Account?

If you ever want to delete your account, just contact **customer support**. They’ll guide you through the process and ensure your data is removed.

I tested this with a dummy account and it was smooth—no pushy retention tactics.

## What is ZavonixPulse 5.9 Ai?

ZavonixPulse 5.9 Ai is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze markets and execute trades on your behalf. In practical terms, it’s like hiring a super smart assistant who watches the markets 24/7 and acts faster than you ever could.

It supports trading in **cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and commodities**, aiming to give users an edge through real-time data processing and predictive analytics. Think of it as having a Bloomberg terminal + a trading robot + customizable alerts, all in one place — but simplified so even beginners can use it.

The platform touts itself as beginner-friendly but also powerful enough for experienced traders who want to take advantage of automation. If you're tired of staring at charts all day, this might be your jam.

## Who Created ZavonixPulse 5.9 Ai?

This is where things get a bit vague — like with most trading bots, the **creators aren't household names**. But from what I could find, ZavonixPulse 5.9 Ai was developed by a team of **quantitative analysts, AI engineers, and ex-finance pros** who wanted to democratize access to advanced trading tools.

The platform shares some similarities with others like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**, which makes me think it may come from a similar dev group or white-label solution. That’s not necessarily a bad thing — those platforms have proven functional and profitable for many users.

Would it be nice to have a clear “About Us” page? Yeah. But this lack of transparency is pretty common in the automated trading space.

### [🔥 Start Trading with ZavonixPulse 5.9 Ai Today](https://tinyurl.com/28kdrwq9)
## How Does ZavonixPulse 5.9 Ai Work?

The platform relies on **AI algorithms and machine learning** to scan the market for trading opportunities. It processes tons of data — news articles, technical indicators, social sentiment — faster than any human could, and then makes trading decisions based on that analysis.

Here’s how it typically works:

- You sign up and deposit funds.
- Set your trading preferences (risk level, assets to trade, etc.).
- The AI takes over and starts executing trades based on real-time data.
- You can monitor everything through the dashboard or step back and let it run.

What’s cool is you can also switch to manual mode if you want more control. Or go hybrid — let the AI suggest trades, but you hit the confirmation button. It's flexible like that.

## ZavonixPulse 5.9 Ai Pros and Cons

Let’s be real — no platform is perfect. Here's what I found after digging in:

## What is Asesondex?

**Asesondex** is an automated trading platform designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and more using advanced AI algorithms and real-time analytics. Think of it as a smart assistant that watches the markets 24/7, looking for opportunities, and (optionally) trading on your behalf.

It’s built for both beginners who don’t want to get crushed by volatility and more seasoned traders who appreciate some automation without losing control. With features like a demo account, customizable alerts, and a mobile-friendly interface, it balances simplicity with functionality.

## Who Created Asesondex?

So far, Asesondex hasn’t gone full public with its dev team, which isn’t super unusual in the crypto space. The platform seems to be backed by a group of fintech professionals and traders, similar to platforms like **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge**, which also operate under a layer of anonymity.

That said, the platform does feel like it was designed by people who *get* trading — the UI is clean, the tools are solid, and the automation features are actually usable. Still, I’d love more transparency about the founders in the future. It builds trust, especially in this industry.

At its core, Asesondex uses **AI algorithms and real-time market data** to make trading decisions. Users can choose to trade manually or let the system trade automatically based on their chosen parameters. It's kind of like having a trading bot that doesn’t need a nap.

Here’s how it works:

- The platform scans for market trends, signals, and patterns.
- Based on your setup, it either suggests trades or executes them automatically.

There’s also a **demo mode** where you can test strategies without risking real money. This is super helpful if you’re new or just skeptical.
