1lkwc0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1lkwc0l/perfect_coffee_maker/,Perfect Coffee Maker,"Alright, hello friends. Currently our set up is a grinder and a French press and we use the Keurig to get instant hot water every morning. The coffee is good-ish depending on several factors (how long ago the beans were ground, the beans themselves, how long the grounds sit in the French press, etc.). The French press makes enough coffee for my boyfriend and I to both get a full cup from one brew cycle (24 oz but it overflows so we only brew 22).
I'm looking for a machine that can do the job of three all at once!
I'm tired of having so much on my counter and want a more consistent flavor. Also, almost every morning my toddler has
""coffee"" so l heat up milk and add a quarter teaspoon of cocoa powder and use a hand frother to make it (also why does every frother give out after like three weeks? Is that a me problem?) So.. bare minimum the machine needs to have ‚Ä¢ a grinder ‚Ä¢ a frother ‚Ä¢ make a consistently good cup of coffee (doesn't matter if it's single serve or multi-cup, as long as it's kinda fast)
And I would LOVE if it also made espresso or had little latte settings, but not necessary. Every-time I look online I keep finding espresso machines or coffee machines with no grinder. Price is not a factor, I spend enough in coffee yearly to justify just about any price. AND if you have a good bean, you can drop those recs too!

Our kitchen is so small that only one person can stand inside at a time. No fancy equipment, just a microwave and a kettle.

This co-worker of mine, although not a bad person at heart, can just be very annoying at times. He acts like a know-it-all even though he might not even know what something is. He will make up some bullshit on the spot, and if you try to educate him about a new thing he will just dismiss you.

So a few days ago we got a box of coffee grounds which I was surprised to see because there was no filter papers/french press or similar equipment in the office kitchen to make ground coffee from. I have worked in a caf√© before so I knew that ground coffee can not be made like instant coffee because it does not completely dissolve in water.

But the smell of that coffee was heavenly so I really wanted to try it but couldn't due to the lack of equipment. This guy says what's the big deal, just mix it in water and make it like normal. To which I tried to tell him that this is not the same but like always he dismissed me.

I asked him to smell it and he too loved the smell so I said you should eat it. He did. Just  the tiniest amount and then said its good (I think he lied). Then I said you should make the coffee your way. He took it as a challenge.

Put some water in the coffee grounds, stirred for a while and then added some milk. It was still looking pale while but I waited for the look on his face after he took a sip. He tried to pretend it was not as bad but I burst out laughing.

Then I attempted to make the coffee using a tea strainer (to show him how it could be made) and it some-what worked. Dude had to eat his own words along with the ground coffee. It was so worth itüòÇ

I wanted to share some good news: I finally quit smoking after nearly 15 years of daily use. I gave it countless tries, patches, gum, cold turkey, vaping, but the habit always crept back, usually during late-night work sessions or stress. I tried everything until a friend suggested I look into more structured help, and I ended up going to [https://www.abbeycarefoundation.com/](https://www.abbeycarefoundation.com/) for a 4‚Äëweek residential program.

The first two weeks were focused on a medically supervised detox, they managed my withdrawal slowly with tapered nicotine patches and supplements to ease anxiety and insomnia. They emphasized replacing the physical habit with mindfulness sessions, yoga, and daily walks. After the detox, the last two weeks involved cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and tele-supported group sessions targeting my triggers, like stress or coffee, and how to restructure those routines.

Beyond quitting cigarettes, what surprised me most was how I relearned to breathe and handle stress without reaching for a smoke. They also included family therapy sessions, which helped me rebuild trust and accountability with those I live with. Upon leaving, they created a detailed aftercare plan: scheduled check-ins, support group referrals, and techniques to handle cravings when I get stressed or travel.

It‚Äôs been two months since I finished the program, and I haven‚Äôt touched a cigarette. I still find it tough sometimes, for example, during late shifts or after long meetings, but I now have real go-to tools: deep breathing, short walks, herbal teas, and reaching out to my support group. Have any of you successfully quit after decades? What kind of program or method helped, the DIY approach, rehab, nicotine alternatives, therapy? I‚Äôd love to hear your real stories and advice.",2,1750931810.0,quittingsmoking,0,1.0,False
1lkw5lx,https://youtu.be/B8zUVMD0vw4,3 Very Scary TRUE Travel Trailer Park Horror Stories,"# ""The Man in the Cap"":

I live in Blue Gem Trailer Park, a dusty stretch off Pyramid Highway where trailers sit close, their metal sides glinting under streetlights. The park‚Äôs small, maybe twenty trailers, with gravel paths and a community laundry room where folks swap stories. I‚Äôm a single mom, raising my daughter, Emily, who‚Äôs sixteen, always glued to her phone or sketching in her notebook. We‚Äôve been here two years, and it felt safe‚Äîkids biking, neighbors sharing coffee on porches, dogs barking at dusk. But last October, everything changed, and now fear sticks to me like damp clothes.It was October 29, 1995. I was on my porch, folding laundry, the air heavy with the smell of dryer sheets. Across the gravel path, two trailers down, I saw Tina, my neighbor. She was 34, small, with tired eyes and a quick smile when we‚Äôd chat about her garden. She was arguing with a tall man in a faded baseball cap, his voice low and sharp. ‚ÄúJust leave me alone, Tina,‚Äù he snapped, loud enough for me to hear. She stood her ground, hands on hips. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with you. Get out.‚Äù He grabbed her arm, rough, but she yanked free and slammed her trailer door. His cap hid his face as he stormed off, kicking gravel. I figured it was a bad breakup. Tina kept to herself lately, so I went back to folding Emily‚Äôs jeans, not thinking much of it.The next morning, sirens ripped me awake. Red and blue lights flashed through my thin curtains. I bolted up, heart racing, and peeked outside. Police cars crowded Tina‚Äôs trailer, yellow tape flapping across her porch. Emily burst into my room, her ponytail messy from sleep. ‚ÄúMom, what‚Äôs going on? There‚Äôs cops everywhere!‚Äù Her voice shook. I pulled her close, trying to stay calm. ‚ÄúStay here, okay? I‚Äôll check.‚Äù I slipped on shoes and stepped outside. Neighbors huddled, whispering. I caught fragments‚Äî ‚Äústabbed,‚Äù ‚Äúblood,‚Äù ‚Äúdead.‚Äù My stomach twisted. A cop wheeled out a body bag from Tina‚Äôs trailer, the zipper loud in the quiet. Tina was gone, murdered in her home.I went back inside, legs shaky. Emily was on the couch, hugging her knees. ‚ÄúIs Tina‚Ä¶ dead?‚Äù she asked, eyes wide. I nodded, throat tight. ‚ÄúYeah, honey. She is.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt tell her about the argument I saw, not yet. That night, I locked our doors for the first time, sliding the deadbolt with a heavy click. Emily noticed, pausing her sketching. ‚ÄúMom, you‚Äôre acting weird. Why‚Äôre we locking up?‚Äù I forced a smile, tucking a strand of her dark hair behind her ear. ‚ÄúJust being careful. Things are‚Ä¶ different now.‚Äù But I couldn‚Äôt shake Tina‚Äôs voice, her scared face, or that man‚Äôs grip on her arm.The park changed overnight. Porches stayed empty. Kids stopped biking. At the laundry room, neighbors whispered about Tina‚Äôs murder, their voices low. ‚ÄúHeard it was brutal,‚Äù one said, folding towels. ‚ÄúCops found her on the kitchen floor.‚Äù I kept quiet, but my hands trembled as I loaded the washer. That night, I found a note under my door, scrawled in black ink on torn paper: ‚ÄúYou saw too much.‚Äù My breath caught. I checked the windows, the locks, my heart pounding so loud I thought Emily would hear. Outside, shadows moved between trailers, but it could‚Äôve been anything‚Äîcats, wind, my imagination. I didn‚Äôt sleep, clutching my phone, listening for footsteps.The next day, I showed the note to the cops. A tired officer in a wrinkled uniform read it, frowning. ‚ÄúProbably kids pulling pranks,‚Äù he said, handing it back. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll look around.‚Äù They found nothing‚Äîno footprints, no fingerprints. I wanted to scream. Kids don‚Äôt write like that. Emily started sticking close, her usual sass gone. ‚ÄúMom, I don‚Äôt wanna go to school,‚Äù she said at breakfast, pushing cereal around. ‚ÄúWhat if something happens?‚Äù I hugged her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe, I promise.‚Äù But my voice wavered. I kept seeing that man‚Äôs cap, his shadowed face.A few nights later, Emily came home from the gas station, pale. We were eating spaghetti, the trailer quiet except for the hum of our old fridge. ‚ÄúMom,‚Äù she whispered, ‚ÄúI saw Dave at the gas station. Tina‚Äôs ex. He was with these creepy guys, all staring at me, then they got quiet when I walked by.‚Äù Dave was a mechanic, tall, with a temper. I‚Äôd seen him yell at Tina once, months back, over money. My fork froze midair. ‚ÄúStay away from him, Emily. Far away.‚Äù She nodded, but her eyes were scared.I couldn‚Äôt sit still. The next day, I went to the diner across the highway, where Dave hung out. The place smelled of grease and burnt coffee. He was in a corner booth, cap low, nursing a mug. I slid in across from him, my pulse hammering. ‚ÄúDave, what happened to Tina?‚Äù I asked, voice steady despite my fear. He looked up, eyes cold, like he was sizing me up. ‚ÄúWhy you asking me? I don‚Äôt know nothing.‚Äù His fingers tapped the table, too fast, like a nervous tic. ‚ÄúPeople talk, Dave. They say you fought with her.‚Äù He leaned close, coffee breath hot on my face. ‚ÄúMind your business, lady, or you‚Äôll regret it.‚Äù I stood, legs weak, and left, feeling his stare burn into my back.That night, I heard footsteps outside, slow and deliberate, crunching gravel near Tina‚Äôs empty trailer. I grabbed my phone, ready to dial 911, but the noise stopped. I peeked through the blinds, heart in my throat, seeing only darkness. The next morning, another note was under my door: ‚ÄúKeep quiet, or you‚Äôre next.‚Äù I called the cops again. They searched Tina‚Äôs trailer, found nothing but dust and her old gardening gloves on the counter. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing all we can,‚Äù the officer said, but his eyes said they had no leads.Emily started sleeping in my room, her mattress dragged to my floor. ‚ÄúMom, what if he comes for us?‚Äù she asked one night, her voice small under the blanket. I held her hand. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let anything happen to you, Em.‚Äù But I wasn‚Äôt sure. I started keeping a kitchen knife under my pillow, its cold handle a grim comfort. Every noise made me jump‚Äîtrash cans rattling, branches scraping, the creak of trailer steps. I stopped going to the laundry room, washing clothes in our sink instead.A week later, I overheard gossip at the park‚Äôs mailbox. ‚ÄúDave‚Äôs been acting strange,‚Äù a neighbor said, clutching her letters. ‚ÄúBurning stuff behind his place at night.‚Äù My stomach churned. That evening, I saw smoke rising across the park. Sirens wailed again, fire trucks this time. Dave‚Äôs apartment had caught fire, flames licking the windows. Cops found bloody clothes in the ashes, charred but unmistakable. I overheard them talking‚Äî ‚ÄúCould be Tina‚Äôs blood.‚Äù My heart raced. Was it him? But Dave was gone, vanished before they could question him.The police still don‚Äôt know who killed Tina. They say Dave‚Äôs a suspect, but without him, the case is stuck. The notes stopped, but the fear didn‚Äôt. Last night, I heard a creak outside, like someone testing my door. I grabbed the knife, holding my breath, but it was quiet again. Emily‚Äôs asleep now, her sketchbook open to a drawing of our trailer, all sharp angles and shadows. I‚Äôm awake, staring at the window, the curtains still. The park‚Äôs too quiet, the kind of quiet that hides things. I keep the knife close, wondering if he‚Äôs out there, watching, waiting for me to look away.





# ""The Campfire Guest"":

I pulled our silver travel trailer into the campsite in Tennessee Colony, Texas, my hands tight on the wheel after a long drive. My husband Carl hopped out to guide me, waving his arms as I backed the trailer onto a gravel pad surrounded by tall pine trees. The air smelled of pine and smoke from nearby campfires. Our daughter Hannah was already unpacking, her six-year-old son Kade bouncing around, dragging his little blue tent from the truck. Hannah‚Äôs partner Thomas and his sons, Nathan and Austin, hauled coolers, folding chairs, and a bag of firewood. We‚Äôd been talking about this trip for weeks, picturing a weekend of roasting marshmallows, telling stories, and maybe fishing in the nearby creek. The campsite felt perfect, quiet, with other trailers scattered in the distance, their lights glowing softly.As I leveled the trailer, the truck‚Äôs tires spun in a patch of mud near the pad. Carl frowned, kicking at the ground. ‚ÄúStuck,‚Äù he muttered. Before we could figure it out, a tractor rumbled up, its engine loud in the stillness. A man in a worn cap and flannel shirt climbed down, his face creased with a friendly smile. ‚ÄúNeed a hand?‚Äù he asked, his voice warm. He introduced himself as William, said he lived on a property nearby. Carl shook his hand, grateful. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be great,‚Äù Carl said. William hooked a chain to the truck and pulled it free in minutes, the tractor‚Äôs growl echoing. ‚ÄúCome by for a drink later,‚Äù I said, feeling thankful. William nodded, his eyes lingering on us‚Äîon the trailer, the kids, the campfire we were setting up‚Äîbefore he drove off, the tractor‚Äôs taillights fading into the trees.That evening, we sat around the fire, the flames casting shadows on the trailer‚Äôs silver sides. Kade held a stick with a marshmallow, giggling as it caught fire. ‚ÄúBlow it out, buddy!‚Äù Hannah laughed, ruffling his hair. Thomas passed around sodas, while Nathan and Austin, both teenagers, tossed a football nearby. The night felt easy, full of promise. William showed up, carrying a six-pack of beer, his boots crunching on the gravel. ‚ÄúHope I‚Äôm not intruding,‚Äù he said, sitting on a spare chair. ‚ÄúNot at all,‚Äù Carl said, handing him a bottle. William seemed nice, telling stories about the area‚Äîold fishing spots, trails through the woods behind our site. ‚ÄúThose woods are peaceful,‚Äù he said, pointing to the dark tree line. ‚ÄúGood for a walk.‚Äù Thomas looked interested. ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll check it out tomorrow,‚Äù he said, glancing at Hannah, who smiled. ‚ÄúSounds fun,‚Äù she said.We talked late, William fitting in easily. He asked about our family, our jobs, even Kade‚Äôs school. ‚ÄúYou folks seem close,‚Äù he said, his smile steady. I nodded, proud, not noticing how his eyes darted to the trailer, the woods, the shadows. When he left, promising to stop by again, I felt good, like we‚Äôd made a friend. Carl and I cleaned up, stacking plates in the trailer‚Äôs tiny sink, while Kade slept on a fold-out bed, his stuffed dinosaur tucked under his arm. The others settled in, too, the trailer cozy with blankets and soft snores.The next day was busy‚Äîfishing, cooking hot dogs, playing cards. Kade ran around, chasing Nathan and Austin, their laughter filling the air. But as evening came, Thomas brought up the walk again. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try those trails William mentioned,‚Äù he said, grabbing a flashlight. Hannah nodded, excited. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go, too,‚Äù she said. Nathan and Austin agreed, eager for adventure. William appeared again, almost like he‚Äôd been waiting, leaning against his tractor near our site. ‚ÄúMind if I join?‚Äù he asked, his voice casual. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Thomas said, not hesitating. I felt that knot in my stomach again, small but there. ‚ÄúBe careful,‚Äù I said, glancing at the dark woods. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be quick,‚Äù Hannah promised, kissing Kade‚Äôs forehead as he dozed in the trailer. Carl and I stayed back, watching them vanish into the trees, their flashlights bobbing like fireflies.We sat by the fire, the crackle mixing with distant cricket sounds. ‚ÄúThink they‚Äôre okay?‚Äù I asked Carl, my voice low. He squeezed my hand, his calloused fingers warm. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre fine. Just a walk.‚Äù But the knot grew, heavy, like a stone in my gut. The woods were too quiet, no laughter, no voices. Minutes dragged‚Äîten, twenty, maybe thirty. Then, a sharp crack split the air. A gunshot. My heart lurched. Another crack, then a third, closer. Carl stood, his face pale. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù he whispered. I grabbed his arm, my nails digging in. ‚ÄúGunshots,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúCarl, something‚Äôs wrong.‚ÄùBefore we could move, William stepped out of the shadows, alone. His friendly smile was gone, replaced by a cold, empty stare. He held a rifle, its barrel glinting in the firelight. My breath caught, my body frozen. ‚ÄúStay where you are,‚Äù he said, his voice low, like a growl. Carl stepped in front of me, his hands up. ‚ÄúWilliam, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù he asked, trying to sound calm. William didn‚Äôt answer. He raised the rifle, and a deafening shot rang out. Carl stumbled, blood blooming across his chest, soaking his shirt. He fell, hitting the gravel hard. I screamed, my legs buckling, and scrambled toward the trailer, my mind blank with panic.Hannah‚Äôs voice pierced the air from the woods. ‚ÄúMom!‚Äù she screamed, running toward the trailer, her face white with fear. William turned, quick as a snake, and fired again. The shot hit Hannah in the back, and she collapsed near the trailer‚Äôs metal steps, her body crumpling like a rag doll. I choked on a sob, diving behind a thick pine tree, my hands shaking so hard I could barely hold myself up. More shots echoed from the woods‚Äîtwo, three, maybe more. My mind screamed: Thomas, Nathan, Austin. Were they gone? I couldn‚Äôt breathe, couldn‚Äôt think. Kade was still in the trailer, asleep. I prayed he wouldn‚Äôt wake, wouldn‚Äôt make a sound.William stood near the trailer, his boots crunching as he paced. The rifle hung loose in his hands, but his eyes scanned the darkness, searching. ‚ÄúAnyone else out here?‚Äù he called, his voice chillingly calm, like he was asking about the time. I pressed myself against the tree, my heart pounding so loud I was sure he‚Äôd hear it. Tears streamed down my face, mixing with dirt. I saw Carl‚Äôs body in the firelight, still, blood pooling under him. Hannah lay nearby, her hand outstretched, her eyes open but empty. My chest ached, my world shattering.Minutes stretched, endless. William walked to the trailer‚Äôs door, peering inside. I held my breath, praying Kade wouldn‚Äôt stir. Then, faintly, sirens wailed in the distance. Red and blue lights flashed through the trees, growing closer. William froze, his head snapping toward the sound. He cursed under his breath‚Äînot loud, but sharp‚Äîand bolted toward the woods, the rifle still in his hands. I waited, trembling, until I heard tires on gravel and voices shouting. ‚ÄúPolice! Anyone here?‚Äù an officer called.I stumbled out, my legs weak, and fell beside Carl, my hands on his chest, begging him to move. He didn‚Äôt. I crawled to Hannah, her face pale, her body cold. I sobbed, clutching her hand, her wedding ring glinting in the firelight. An officer found me, his voice gentle. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, are you hurt?‚Äù he asked, wrapping a blanket around me. I shook my head, my throat too tight to speak. ‚ÄúMy family‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered, pointing to Carl, to Hannah. He nodded, his face grim, and called for help.They found Kade in the trailer, still asleep, his dinosaur clutched tight. I held him, crying, as police searched the woods. Hours later, they told me the rest. Thomas, Nathan, and Austin were found in a pond nearby, their bodies shot and left in the water. William had lured them out, killed them in the woods, then came for us. Police caught him by morning, hiding near his property, his tractor stained with blood. They said it was about a land dispute, our campsite too close to his land. He‚Äôd planned it, waited, used our trust against us.Months later, I‚Äôm with Kade, trying to rebuild. He asks about his mom, his grandpa, and I don‚Äôt know what to say. Every night, I see William‚Äôs cold eyes, hear the gunshots, feel the terror of hiding while my family died. The trailer‚Äôs still in my driveway, silver and silent, a reminder of that night. I trusted a stranger. We all did. And it cost me everything but Kade. The fear never leaves, like a shadow I can‚Äôt escape.





# ""The Heinze Trailer"":

I‚Äôd been living in the New Hope Plantation trailer park for about four months when everything changed. My trailer was a beat-up single-wide, with peeling paint and a door that never quite locked right. I‚Äôd moved there after losing my job at the warehouse, figuring it was cheap and quiet, a place to start over. The park was small, maybe twenty trailers scattered across a dusty lot, surrounded by scraggly pines. Most folks kept to themselves, nodding politely but never lingering to chat. At night, the only sounds were the hum of window-unit air conditioners and the occasional yip of a stray dog. But that night, something felt wrong, like a knot in my gut I couldn‚Äôt untie.I was sprawled on my sagging couch, trying to focus on an old car magazine, when shouting broke the silence. It came from the Heinze trailer, two lots down, a faded blue double-wide with a sagging porch and a rusty pickup out front. It was Guy Jr.‚Äôs voice, loud and jagged, cutting through the quiet. ‚ÄúYou never listen to me! You think you‚Äôre better than me!‚Äù he yelled. His father‚Äôs voice answered, steady but strained. ‚ÄúSon, calm down. We can talk about this. Just put it down.‚Äù My hands froze on the magazine, the pages crinkling under my fingers. I‚Äôd seen Guy Jr. around, always in a hurry, his eyes darting like he was looking for trouble or running from it. He was in his early twenties, lanky, with a scruffy beard and a habit of pacing outside his trailer, muttering to himself.The shouting got louder, words tumbling over each other. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it, Dad! I‚Äôm done with this!‚Äù Guy Jr. snapped. I heard a woman‚Äôs voice, softer, pleading. ‚ÄúPlease, both of you, stop it.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know her name, but I‚Äôd seen her before, maybe Guy‚Äôs mom, always looking tired, carrying groceries or chasing a little kid around. The argument felt different from the usual family spats in the park‚Äîthere was a raw edge to it, like something was about to break.I set the magazine down and crept to the window, easing the blinds apart. The Heinze trailer‚Äôs lights glowed through thin curtains, casting long shadows that moved fast, like people pacing or fighting. My heart started thumping, loud enough I could hear it in my ears. Should I call someone? The cops? But what if it was just a family thing, loud but harmless? I‚Äôd look like a fool, stirring up trouble for nothing. I grabbed my phone anyway, my thumb hovering over the 911 button, but I didn‚Äôt press it. I just stood there, listening, my mouth dry.Then came the scream. It was high and sharp, like a knife cutting through the air, and it stopped so fast it left my ears ringing. Silence followed, heavy and wrong. No more shouting, no voices, just the faint hum of the air conditioners. My legs felt weak, but I forced myself to move. I slipped on my shoes and eased my door open, stepping onto the gravel lot. The park was still, the other trailers dark or faintly lit, their curtains drawn. I stayed low, moving toward the Heinze trailer, my sneakers crunching too loud on the gravel. I stopped behind their pickup, crouching, my breath shallow. The trailer‚Äôs front door was ajar, a sliver of yellow light spilling out. Inside, I heard muttering, low and frantic‚ÄîGuy Jr.‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúOh God, oh God, what have I done? What have I done?‚Äù he kept saying, over and over, like a broken record.My stomach churned. I wanted to run, to lock myself in my trailer and pretend I hadn‚Äôt heard anything. But I couldn‚Äôt move. I peeked around the truck, my hands trembling. The door creaked wider, and Guy Jr. stumbled out onto the porch. His shirt was soaked with something dark, clinging to his chest. In his hand, he held something heavy, maybe a wrench or a pipe, but the shadows hid it. His face was pale, his eyes wide and unblinking, like he wasn‚Äôt seeing the world anymore. He didn‚Äôt notice me. He just staggered down the steps, muttering, ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen like this,‚Äù and ran into the darkness between the trailers.I stayed crouched, my heart pounding so hard I thought it‚Äôd burst. My phone was still in my hand, the 911 screen glowing. I could‚Äôve called then, should‚Äôve called, but I kept thinking, what if it‚Äôs not what it seems? What if he just hurt someone, not‚Ä¶ worse? Minutes dragged by, maybe fifteen, maybe more. I don‚Äôt know how long I stayed there, frozen, my knees aching against the gravel. Then sirens pierced the air, faint at first, then louder, closing in. Red and blue lights swept across the park, bouncing off the trailers, making the whole place look like a nightmare. Three police cars screeched into the lot, tires spitting gravel. Officers jumped out, guns drawn, shouting to each other. ‚ÄúSecure the area!‚Äù one barked. ‚ÄúCheck the trailer, now!‚ÄùI ducked lower, my back pressed against the truck‚Äôs tire. Two officers kicked in the Heinze door, their flashlights cutting through the gloom inside. One came out almost immediately, his face gray, speaking fast into his radio. ‚ÄúMultiple victims, we need backup and medics, now. It‚Äôs a bloodbath.‚Äù My breath caught, and I pressed a hand over my mouth to keep quiet. Bloodbath? How many people? I thought of the woman‚Äôs voice, the little kid I‚Äôd seen playing outside their trailer, the tired-looking mom.I edged back toward my trailer, keeping to the shadows, my heart racing. From my window, I watched the police swarm the Heinze place. More cars arrived, then an ambulance, its lights flashing silently. An officer stood by the porch, talking to another. ‚ÄúEight down, one kid alive but bad off,‚Äù he said, his voice low but clear. ‚ÄúNever seen anything like this.‚Äù The other officer shook his head. ‚ÄúWhat kind of monster does this to his own family?‚ÄùI sank to the floor, my back against the wall, my hands shaking so bad I dropped my phone. Eight people. Dead. And a kid, hurt. I saw flashes of the Heinze family in my mind‚ÄîGuy Sr., always tinkering with that rusty pickup; the young woman with the quiet smile; the teenage boy who‚Äôd waved at me once. All gone. I kept hearing Guy Jr.‚Äôs voice, ‚ÄúWhat have I done?‚Äù and that scream, so sharp it still echoed in my head.Hours passed. The police brought out body bags, one after another, each one heavy, sagging in the middle. I counted seven, then an eighth, smaller than the rest. My stomach lurched. The little boy, maybe three, was carried out last, wrapped in a blanket, his face pale and blank. A paramedic held him close, rushing to the ambulance. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs breathing, but he‚Äôs critical,‚Äù she said to another medic. ‚ÄúGet him to the hospital, fast.‚ÄùThe park never went back to normal. The Heinze trailer was boarded up, yellow police tape crisscrossing the door. Neighbors stopped talking, stopped nodding. Everyone moved like they were scared of their own shadows. I heard whispers that Guy Jr. had been arrested, that he‚Äôd snapped, killed his whole family and a friend who‚Äôd been staying over. Nobody knew why. I kept replaying that night, the argument, the scream, the moment I didn‚Äôt call 911. If I‚Äôd acted sooner, could I have saved them? One call, and maybe that little boy wouldn‚Äôt be alone.I moved out a month later. I couldn‚Äôt stay, not with the Heinze trailer staring at me every day, its windows dark, the porch empty. Even now, I dream about it. I see the blood on the walls, the body bags, Guy Jr.‚Äôs wild eyes. I hear that scream, over and over, and his voice, ‚ÄúWhat have I done?‚Äù I check my locks twice every night, keep a bat by my bed, jump at every noise. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever shake the feeling that something‚Äôs waiting, just out of sight, ready to break the silence again.",1,1750931798.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1lkw4xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1lkw4xo/concerned_about_my_childs_sudden_change_in/,Concerned about my child‚Äôs sudden change in behaviour,"We have a 1.5yo (20 months) who's always been a very happy, chilled, content and calm baby and toddler. He's usually great at playing independently. I'm currently pregnant with our second and on my worst day of first trimester nausea I once had to leave him alone in his room for 45min cause I was throwing up ‚Äì he didn't seem to care at all, I could see and hear him happily babbling and playing by himself through the baby monitor. Nights were also okay, he had started to mostly sleep through the night after I night-weaned two months ago (still breastfeeding but only 1-2x a day and not at night anymore). 

All this changed drastically a while ago. He now wakes up several times a night whining and climbing on me (we cosleep in his large floor bed) and only wants to sleep in my hug. During the day he is clinging to me nonstop as well, and as soon as I need to do something like prepare breakfast for us or maybe afterwards make myself a coffee quickly, he whines the entire time, clings to my leg, tries to pulls me down to him etc. If I don't give in, he eventually starts crying properly with tears rolling down his face. He then only calms down if I pick him up and hold him, and he then wants to stay in my hug for a very long time and to be comforted.

While all this is also challenging for me, I'm mostly concerned about him and wondering if I should be worried. This change has been quite sudden and it seems like a 180¬∞ turn from our happy, content, bubbly, easy-going child that made us try for a second after just a bit over a year, cause every day had just been so smooth and full of joy. I'm worried about what's going on in his little mind and if he's okay.

1lkw08y,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Salary_Strict/comments/1lkw08y/parkinsons_disease_symptoms_causes_prevention/,"Parkinson's Disease Symptoms, Causes & Prevention","Parkinson's disease could also be a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement.

In the early stages of Parkinsonism, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms won't swing once you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinsonism symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.

Although Parkinsonism can't be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms. Occasionally, your doctor may suggest surgery to manage certain regions of your brain and improve your symptoms.

# Symptoms¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Parkinson's disease signs and symptoms are often different for everyone. Early signs could even be mild and go unnoticed. Symptoms often begin on one side of your body and typically remain worse thereon side, even after symptoms begin to affect all sides.

Parkinson's signs and symptoms may include:

* **Tremor**. A tremor, or shaking, usually begins during a limb, often your hand or fingers. You‚Äôll rub your thumb and forefinger back-and-forth mentioned as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremor when it's at rest.
* **Slowed movement (bradykinesia).**¬†Over time, Parkinsonism's may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter once you walk. It‚Äôs getting to be difficult to urge out of a chair. You‚Äôll drag your feet as you're trying to steer.
* **Rigid muscles**. Muscle stiffness may occur in any neighborhood of your body. The stiff muscles are often painful and limit your range of motion.
* **Impaired posture and balance**. Your posture may become stooped, otherwise, you'll have balance problems as a result of Parkinsonism.
* **Loss of automatic movements**. You‚Äôll have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling, or swinging your arms once you walk.
* **Speech changes**. You‚Äôll speak softly, quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking. Your speech could even be more of a monotone rather than with the quality inflections.
* **Writing changes**. It‚Äôs getting to become hard to write down, and your writing may appear small.

# Causes

In Parkinson's, certain nerve cells (neurons) within the brain gradually break down or die. Many of the symptoms are because of a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine. When dopamine levels decrease, it causes abnormal brain activity, leading to symptoms of Parkinsonism.

The explanation for Parkinsonism is unknown, but several factors appear to play a task, including:

* **Your genes**. Researchers have identified specific genetic mutations that can cause Parkinsonism. But these are uncommon except in rare cases with many relations affected by Parkinsonism.

However, certain gene variations appear to increase the danger of Parkinsonism but with a relatively small risk of Parkinsonism for each of these genetic markers.

* **Environmental triggers.**¬†Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may increase the danger of later Parkinsonism, but the danger is relatively small.

Researchers have also noted that tons of changes occur within the brains of people with Parkinsonism, although it is not clear why these changes occur. These changes include:

* **The presence of Lewy bodies**. Clumps of specific substances within brain cells are microscopic markers of Parkinsonism. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these Lewy bodies hold an important clue to the reason for Parkinsonism.
* **Alpha-synuclein is found within Lewy bodies**. Although many substances are found within Lewy bodies, scientists believe an important one is that the natural and widespread protein called alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein). It's found altogether Lewy bodies during a clumped form that cells can't break down. This is often currently an important focus among Parkinsonism researchers.

**Risk factors**

*Risk factors for Parkinsonism include:*

* **Age.**¬†Young adults rarely experience Parkinsonism. It ordinarily begins in middle or late life, and thus the danger increases with age. People usually develop the disease around age 60 or older.
* **Heredity**. Having a thorough relative with Parkinsonism increases the possibility that you are going to develop the disease. However, your risks are still small unless you've many relatives in your family with Parkinsonism.
* **Gender.**¬†Men are more likely to develop Parkinsonism than are women.
* **Exposure to toxins**. Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase your risk of Parkinsonism.

**Complications**

Parkinson's disease is typically amid these additional problems, which may be treatable:

* **Thinking difficulties.**¬†You‚Äôll experience cognitive problems (dementia) and thinking difficulties. These usually occur within the later stages of Parkinsonism. Such cognitive problems aren't very conscious of medications.
* **Depression and emotional changes.**¬†You‚Äôll experience depression, sometimes within the very early stages. Receiving treatment for depression can make it easier to handle the other challenges of Parkinsonism.

You may also experience other emotional changes, like fear, anxiety, or loss of motivation. Doctors may provide you with medications to treat these symptoms.

* **Swallowing problems.**¬†You‚Äôll develop difficulties with swallowing as your condition progresses. Saliva may accumulate in your mouth because of slowed swallowing, leading to drooling.
* **Chewing and eating problems.**¬†Late-stage Parkinsonism affects the muscles in your mouth, making chewing difficult. This may cause choking and poor nutrition.
* **Sleep problems and sleep disorders.**¬†People with Parkinsonism often have sleep problems, including awakening frequently throughout the night, awakening early, or falling asleep during the day.

People also can experience rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, which involves acting out your dreams. Medications may help your sleep problems.

* **Bladder problems.**¬†Parkinsonism may cause bladder problems, including being unable to manage urine or having difficulty urinating.
* **Constipation.**¬†Many folks with Parkinsonism develop constipation, mainly because of a slower alimentary tract.

*You may also experience:*

* **Vital sign changes**. You‚Äôll feel dizzy or lightheaded once you stand because of a sudden drop in sign (orthostatic hypotension).
* **Smell dysfunction**. You‚Äôll experience problems alongside your sense of smell. You‚Äôll have difficulty identifying certain odors or the difference between odors.
* **Fatigue**. Many folks with Parkinsonism's lose energy and knowledge fatigue, especially later within the day. The cause isn't known.
* **Pain**. Some people with Parkinsonism's experience pain, either in specific areas of their bodies or throughout their bodies.
* **Physical Relation dysfunction**. Some people with Parkinsonism notice a decrease in concupiscence or performance.

# Prevention

Because the reason for Parkinson's is unknown, proven ways to prevent the disease also remain a mystery.

Some research has shown that regular aerobics might reduce the danger of Parkinsonism.

Some other research has shown that people who drink caffeine ‚Äî which is found in coffee, tea, and cola ‚Äî get Parkinsonism's less often than people who don't drink it. However, it's still not known whether caffeine actually protects against getting Parkinson's, or is claimed indifferently. Currently, there's not enough evidence to suggest drinking caffeinated beverages to¬†[**protect against Parkinson's**](https://zeelabpharmacy.com/product/citizine-800). Tea is additionally related to a reduced risk of developing Parkinsonism.

1lkvz32,https://i.redd.it/nhulgq24t89f1.jpeg,My baby got out after 9 weeks,"This ugly baby finally got out today. I'm so blessed right now.
It all started 9 weeks ago with blood in the urine and just a little belly pain. I thought I got food poisoning because I got really dizzy and vomit. 

- Day 01: the next morning I went to the hospital and a stone is confirmed as a size of 8mm by ultrasound. Doctor want to admit me in for a surgery but I refused. I searched that 8mm size has a 10% chance of peeing it out so I want to try. This sub got me strenght and less nervous so truly thank you for all your journeys that you shared. Doctor prescribed me Flomax and Mobic 7.5mg x 02 weeks.
- Day 02 : the pain is so bad I vomited and had pain. But I take Mobic (meloxicam 7.5mm) the pain would went away
- Day 04: because I'm so scared of hydronephrosis which could damage my kidney so I go to take a CT scan in a bigger hospital. The result came out in the CT (no contrast) that it's actually 2 stones 5mm + 3mm long next to each other instead of 1 big stone 8mm. Width of each stone is just 2 and 3mm. That doctor tell me the stones would probably come out by themselves, no need surgery. He prescribed No-Spa and Rowatinex additionally to my old drugs.
To my thinking I think the CT scan showed 1 big stone with a bottleneck, but 5 doctors (2 at the CT room, one at the clinic, 2 are my friends of friend that I asked them) all told me it's two stones. So I'm less worrying. 

- After a while the pain completely gone so I'm not sure if I'm having a stone. I stop taking Mobic after 2 weeks because there was no pain. I dont take No Spa (I dont remember why). So I only take Flomax (tamsulosin) and Rowatinex daily.

- After 4 weeks I went back to the small hospital at the beginning for the ultrasound (because I got no pain and I believed it has got out). Sadly the ultrasound said it's 10mm now and doctor at the small hospital pressured me for the surgery again. (It's a different doctor). Because I believe in the CT scan result more (5mm x 3mm and 3mm x 2mm stones). So I refused surgery again. The real reason is I'm so scared of the stents. I will only take surgery as the last resort if hydronephrosis level went from mild to medium. But luckily it didnt happen... this time the ultrasound said there is no hydronephrosis at all. This doctor prescribed No Spa. So I remember that I must take No Spa. At this time my everyday drugs were: Flomax, No Spa, Rowatinex.

- At the 6th week I peed red color like the first night, so I go get a test in blood and urine. The result came out there is no infection. So I go home and take Mobic for a few days and the color went back to normal.

- At the 8th week I got this strange feeling in the lower part. It's ticklish and annoying. Especially at the end of the pee the ticklish feeling increase. My husband feared that it's a sign of infection so he take me to a blood work + urine test again (in my country testing centers are everywhere like coffee shops, so people can come and order test by their own). The test came clean with no infection so I went home. Drink lot of beer mixed with lemon/lime everyday.

- At the 9th week which is today. I suddenly got a razor pain when starting to pee, so I go get my strainer and catch this baby while peeing like normal (strangely no pain at all)
- It came out as one stone which is 8mm x 3mm with a bottle neck. 
Now I can live in peace again with 3 litres of water everyday.

Before, because of my job, for years I was drinking 2 large cups of coffee everyday with no water at all, my meals had a lot vegetables with high oxalate. (I ate like 300mg of spinach and alike everyday). I drink no lemon or orange because of stomach problem. I drink no milk. But now I learned that lacks of calcium can lead to excessive of calcium as our body will get emergency calcium from our bones.... and lacks of citrate and be a huge problem, too.

Well I learned my lessons. 
Thank you for being here. I cannot make here without you guys. This sub means ton in my life.

English is not my main language so Im sorry for the broken language.

Thank you and wish you all the best..!",1,1750931102.0,KidneyStones,0,1.0,False
1lkvy51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1lkvy51/a_face_too_familiar_the_isaac_merrin_case/,A Face Too Familiar: The Isaac Merrin Case,"*Cold cases don‚Äôt solve themselves, but they do get buried*. My job today was to help with the burying. I was assigned to archive duty, sifting through old unsolveds, like missing children and bodies found off country roads. As I sipped my burnt coffee, stamping papers, Detective Cavanagh burst through the door. ‚ÄúHey, Brenner. LT wants you to tie off the Merrin case,‚Äù he said, throwing a folder onto my desk. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you do it? I‚Äôm already swamped,‚Äù I responded. ‚ÄúHey man, boss's orders‚Äù. I sighed as the door shut.¬†

I stared at the folder for a moment before opening it. I thought it was strange that we were closing the case so soon, as the incident only happened a month previous. I figured Lt. Rourke might have mistaken it for an older case, so I went to check with him first. I lightly knocked on his door and welcomed myself in. ‚ÄúWhat is it, Brenner?‚Äù he asked sternly. ‚ÄúI just came to make sure you gave me the right case to close,‚Äù I said, laying the case report in front of him. ‚ÄúYeah, the Merrin case, that's the one,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDidn't this only happen last month, sir?‚Äù I asked, confused. ‚ÄúWell, it's pretty cut and dry, isn't it? Self-inflicted. Guy was a schizo,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúYeah, I guess.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt argue and swiftly left.¬†

I headed into the old, dull archive room once again, the smell of dust hit my nostrils immediately. I slapped the folder back on the desk and took a seat. I curled the cover open and started to browse through the pages of evidence. I read one of the pages briefly.¬†

‚ÄúSubject identified as Isaac Merrin (DOB: 05/16/1998) was discovered deceased in his residence on 02/13/25. The body was found by a neighbor, \[NAME REDACTED\], after hearing noises from the unit above. The scene showed no signs of forced entry or struggle. The entry door was locked from the inside with the secondary chain engaged. No additional persons were captured on CCTV entering or exiting the premises.‚Äù I flipped the piece of paper, only to be met by the photograph of the front door from the outside. The door showed no evidence of struggle, like the report claimed. I scanned the next page in the folder; this time, it was a statement from the neighbor downstairs. ‚ÄúI heard something, like heavy footsteps or banging above me around 9:30. At first, I thought he was moving furniture again. He‚Äôd been doing that late at night lately. I went up to knock and ask him to keep it down. No answer at the door, so I called it in.‚Äù

\[Portion redacted for privacy\]

‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived here nine years. Never had issues with him. But lately‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. Something just felt off. I saw him in the stairwell the night before. Thought it was weird he didn‚Äôt say hi. He always did. He looked at me like he didn‚Äôt know who I was‚Äù. Another photo followed the statement. This one was a photo of the main room of Mr. Merrins‚Äô apartment. It was a mess. Couch cushions were ripped off, the television was shattered, and there were pieces of broken vases and plates everywhere. Another witness statement followed this picture, from his mother. Poor woman.¬†

Witness Statement ‚Äì LORRAINE MERRIN.

Mother of ISAAC MERRIN

Interviewed by Officer J. Halpern.¬†

‚ÄúIsaac had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was nineteen. He‚Äôd been managing it well for a while, but now and then he'd go off his meds without telling anyone. It was usually obvious. He‚Äôd start acting strange, get paranoid, and avoid calls. About a week before‚Ä¶ what happened‚Ä¶ he called me around midnight. He said someone was following him. When I asked who, he just said, 'It‚Äôs me, but it‚Äôs not me.' I asked him what he meant, and he said it was like he had a twin same voice, same clothes, everything. I tried to calm him down and told him it wasn‚Äôt real, that it was just the illness talking. I told him to check if he‚Äôd missed any doses. He didn‚Äôt say much after that, just hung up. I texted the next morning, asked if he was okay. He said, 'He‚Äôs not gone. He‚Äôs just watching.' I‚Äôve been worried he was off his meds again. He‚Äôs done that before, skips them for days when he feels like he‚Äôs clear‚Äù. Jesus Christ.. Poor guy.¬†

I glanced over the statement again when a part caught my eye. ‚ÄúHe said someone was following him. When I asked who, he just said, 'It‚Äôs me, but it‚Äôs not me.‚Äô‚Äù Something isn't adding up. Why would a man who is having a schizophrenic episode destroy his house, lock his doors, and then take his own life? I mean, in some regard, it makes sense, but at the same time‚Ä¶ something feels odd about this.¬†

The next page held two grisly photos. The first was a photo of Isaac Merrin‚Äôs mirror, bloodied and smashed into pieces. The next was a photo of Isaac, lying on the bathroom tile. A pool of blood surrounded his head, and shards of mirror were stuck into his forehead and face. It was gruesome. The rest of the case file was boring compared to the starting contents. Photos of his apartment from different angles, statements from neighbors, all of which tell the same story as the other neighbor, and statements from responding officers.¬†

Near the end of the file, there was a photograph of his pill sorter. 7 slots, which contained a few pills for every day of the week. The first 5 slots were empty, the other 2 held their contents. The last empty container fell on a Thursday. I swiped back a few pages to the original report of the incident and began to read. ‚ÄúSubject identified as Isaac Merrin (DOB: 05/16/1998) was discovered deceased in his residence on 02/13/25.‚Äù I pulled out my phone and scrolled back on the calendar app to February 13th, 2025. It fell on a Thursday, the same day he had taken his meds for the last time. Whatever Isaac saw was real‚Ä¶¬†

I picked up the case file and packed it into my briefcase. I had to investigate this further. On my way out, I stopped into Lt. Rourke‚Äôs Office to let him know I was heading to Isaac Merrin‚Äôs apartment. I knew if I told him the real nature of my absences, I would get chewed out, so I told him I had to tie up a loose end to close the case. He waved me off, and I swiftly left.¬†

I arrived at the apartment complex just before noon. I walked up to the front desk and flashed my badge, telling the young girl working that I needed a key to apartment 412. She handed me a small key with a tag that said ‚Äú412‚Äù on it. I thanked her and stepped into the stairwell. As I climbed the first set of stairs, I peered up at the camera in the corner, the very same one that caught Isaac‚Äôs last moments. Goosebumps appeared on my skin. I finally reached floor 4. I approached the door and inserted the key. After some rustling around, the lock clicked and I was in.

The room was neat and all cleaned up, a sharp contrast to the photos I'd seen prior. I headed into the bedroom to locate the pill sorter to confirm what the photo showed. I started looking around the room, but to no avail. When I opened a drawer in the wardrobe, I spotted a journal lying on top of some folded shirts. Curious, I picked it up and began to flip through the pages.

The first entry was from 2021, detailing Isaac's life and his interests. Nothing unusual. I quickly scanned the pages until I reached an entry that was dated February 2nd, 2025. In what appeared to be rushed handwriting, the entry read ‚ÄúI saw myself. I was picking up some milk at the supermarket and saw myself on the other side of the aisle, staring at me. He just sat there, not smiling or anything. I'm unsure if this was a delusion. It looked so real. I think I'm gonna sleep it off. Pretty creepy‚Äù. I waited a moment before flipping to the next entry.

This one was dated February 4th. 2025. ‚ÄúI saw myself again. This time in the mirror. I was in the bathroom, washing my hands, when I saw myself in the mirror. Nothing weird until I noticed the mirror didn't match my movements. It was standing still while I moved around. I practically shit myself and ran into the bedroom where I still am, writing this. I think I need my dosage increased. I need to see my doctor.‚Äù This is incredibly unsettling.

I thumb through the next few entries, all of which describe seeing himself again. Every entry became more disturbing. You can practically see his descent into madness as he writes. I carefully studied the last 2 entries. The second to last was dated February 11th, 2025, 2 days before he died. ‚ÄúHe won't leave me alone! I don't know what to do anymore. I'm too afraid to leave the house. I haven't had any food in a few days. If I leave the room, I get tormented by myself, or it, or whatever the fuck it is. I don't know how much longer this can last,‚Äù

I began to peer over my shoulder out of spite. This was incredibly unnerving. The last entry was dated February 13th, 2025. The day his life came to an end. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen him since I locked myself in the room. I'm gonna go out to get food and water and come back to write the rest. I hope whatever hallucination is going on is over.‚Äù There is a break in the writing, which continues 2 lines down. ‚ÄúHe is at the door. I got a knock on the door, and for whatever reason, I looked through the peephole. It was me. He is fiddling with the handle. I don't know what to do. God help me, please. I want this nightmare to end. I need to escape or something. Maybe through the bathroom window. It's a long drop, but I don't have a choice. I'm going to be killed if I don't escape.‚Äù How was this not found in the search? This is fucking horrifying!

As I closed the journal and took a breath, I heard the apartment door shut lightly, as if someone didn't want to be heard. I assumed Lt. Rourke sent Detective Cavanagh to help me clear up the case or something. I was pretty freaked out from reading the journal, so before I left the room, I shouted out to whomever entered. ‚ÄúHello, who is it?‚Äù No response.

I felt my heart begin to beat out of my chest. I gripped the pistol on my hip and slowly headed into the main room. I froze with fear. Lying on the old, stained couch was the rotten, aged body of Isaac Merrin, roughed up by Mother Nature underground. In that moment, I felt a weird presence over my shoulder.

I flipped around with great speed, only to be met by‚Ä¶ Isaac Merrin. His expression was blank and soulless. I unholstered my weapon and pointed it toward him‚Ä¶ or it. ‚ÄúHANDS UP NOW, ON YOUR FUCKING KNEES,‚Äù I screamed. He just stood there, staring at me with his expressionless eyes. I repeated my warning and moved my finger onto the trigger of the gun. With a sudden jolt, it ran at me, letting out a screech that can only be described as otherworldly. I squeezed the trigger with every bit of force I was capable of. I hit it right between the eyes. It quickly fell to the ground, going silent. Dark, thick blood began to pool around the area of his head. I quickly backed up and took in the situation. I couldn't help but weep at the scene that was present in front of me. I grabbed my phone out of my pocket, keeping my weapon targeted toward the body on the floor. I could barely type in Lt. Rourke's number, as I was shaking uncontrollably. As I struggled to type in his number, my screen lit up.

INCOMING CALL

Lt. Rourke

I swiftly answered the call and screamed into the phone before he could get a chance to get a word out. ‚ÄúGET HERE NOW. HE WASN‚ÄôT CRAZY. I JUST KILLED THE TWIN. HELP ME, ROURKE, PLEASE! I NEED HELP NOW. I'M AT ISAACS APARTMENT.‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúWhat?! Fuck‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre on the way Brenner, stay put! I was calling you to tell you that Isaac's body was dug up from his grave,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ It brought him here. The real Isaacs' body is with me‚Ä¶ Fuck‚Ä¶ please hurry Rourke for fuck sakes!‚Äù I said, hyperventilating.

Brenner and a few cruisers showed up 2 minutes later. I was taken from the scene and had to give a statement of what happened and what I saw. In the end, the situation was chalked up to a twin who was separated during a home birth, as further research showed Isaac was born in a home birth in an old farm town with a population of 65 people. The report claims that Mrs. Merrin was unaware she was having twins, and gave one up at birth to somebody as she couldn‚Äôt handle raising 2 children.

Its all bullshit. That thing, whatever it was, wasn‚Äôt human, I swear it! I have never seen something so soulless and emotionless as that‚Ä¶ creature. I will never be able to recover from the event that occurred that day.

*Cold cases don‚Äôt solve themselves, but they do get buried.*

Hard texture, slow melting, quickly cools drinks

üßä Suitable for: regular cold drinks, mass production, daily use

‚ö†Ô∏è Not suitable for chewing (because it's very hard)

üî∏ Chewing Ice

Light and crisp - great chewing experience

Absorbs flavors, melts faster

üßä Suitable for: cocktails, soda, iced coffee, chewing enthusiasts

üî∏ Cube Ice

Standard hard square/rectangular ice cubes

Often made from traditional refrigerator ice manufacturers

Longest shelf life in drinks

üßä Suitable for: cocktails, slow drinking

Let‚Äôs Break It Down,"I‚Äôm starting this post to thoroughly discuss and explore **what truly makes the best coffee grinder for espresso**, and I‚Äôd love for this to become a comprehensive guide that helps others (and myself) make the right choice.

Whether you‚Äôre just stepping into espresso or have been pulling shots for years, you know that the grinder is just as important‚Äîif not more‚Äîthan the espresso machine itself. With so many options on the market (flat vs conical burrs, stepless vs stepped adjustment, dosing vs single-dose, etc.), it‚Äôs easy to get overwhelmed.

This post is meant for deep discussion and insight gathering, so let‚Äôs talk about it.

Here are some questions to get the conversation going:

* **Which grinders are currently considered the best for home espresso setups under $500? Over $500?**
* **How much does grind consistency actually matter for flavor and shot quality?**
* **What‚Äôs the real difference between flat and conical burrs for espresso taste and workflow?**
* **Is stepless adjustment necessary, or are some stepped grinders good enough?**
* **How important is retention (or low retention) in a grinder, especially for single dosing?**
* **Do you think it‚Äôs better to go for a multi-purpose grinder or a dedicated espresso grinder?**
* **Which grinders are easiest to clean and maintain without needing full disassembly?**
* **What underrated grinders punch above their weight and deserve more attention?**
* **Are there any newer models or brands in 2025 that are proving themselves?**

Please share your experiences, regrets, favorite grinders, must-know tips, or anything you‚Äôve learned the hard way. Whether you‚Äôre running a Niche, Eureka, DF, Baratza, or something else entirely‚Äîyour input can really help others decide what‚Äôs worth the investment.

1lkvuua,https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsySellers/comments/1lkvuua/is_it_still_worth_getting_into_the_tshirt/,Is it still worth getting into the T-shirt business in 2025? (Ex-stock photo contributor here),"Hi all,

I used to make a solid side income from stock photography, but like many others, that‚Äôs dried up in recent years. Oversaturation has really killed it for me.

I‚Äôm now thinking of switching to print-on-demand, focusing on T-shirts, and selling through platforms like Amazon and Etsy.

I‚Äôm a graphic designer and illustrator with a good understanding of print setup, and I‚Äôm also a photographer, so I can handle all the design and product photos myself. I‚Äôve done some niche research and I‚Äôm not planning to make generic ‚ÄúI love coffee‚Äù shirts. I‚Äôm targeting specific markets that don‚Äôt have much decent content and have a few design ideas.

My question is: do I realistically have a chance at making decent money with this over time? Or is it also very oversaturated to start up in 2025?

That said, I‚Äôm also wondering if T-shirts are even the best product to focus on. Would I be better off making stickers, cards, or other items with less competition and quicker production?

1lkvsct,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lkvsct/its_a_lot/,It's a lot,"Hi, I will just ramble and word vomit because I don't have anyone to talk to.
I just have a lot going on for me and I have 0 support, my boyfriend even made me cancel my therapy appointments when he found out I am doing therapy

So here goes: I have Grave disease with a low metabolism (even before being diagnosed) and the medication is not working properly so my doctor wants to increase the dosage. The issue  is that I put a lot of weight on me and I am starting to be fat. I do sports 1 h per day but my calorie burn is getting lower and lower. I do hula hoop and aerobics. I burn less than 1600 kcal without the medication and now even less. I am scared of what will happen when the dosage increases. I have just a slice of toast with homemade jam (so I know what's in there) or some cereal in the morning, a cup of coffee and my chia seeds (2 table spoons) and my collagen dose. For lunch I try to have a salad most of the time with homemade dressings (found a bunch of recipes), but my boyfriend got bored of them so now I keep an eye on how much bread I eat (1-2 slices of homemade bread, no sugar) and in the evening I have a home cooked meal (this I don't care what it is, but I keep an eye on that portion) and from time to time alcohol. Now, I reached 60kg and I look 6 months pregnant (160 cm tall) and I panicked as my family is obese and the last time I had that weight I sprung to 75-80kg in no time. So I panicked and started to cry and he just started to make fun of me and there was 0 empathy, more over, he told me I was annoying for crying over so little and I should not stress because he would love me and roll me around when I will be a ball.

2. I am beyond stressed at work. I went through 2 restructurings and the new job will start in August, same company, different department. The future boss is already making me work for him and doesn't listen, get defensive when I express my opinion, and my old boss broke so many rules of the work you have no idea. Also the old boss is treating me like a secretary. And you know what else happened,my old company from the first restructuring is coming to me and sending me emails asking to explain what I did in 2024 because they don't understand something. I talked with my boyfriend and he told me I should stop being so frustrated and just get over it. 

3. We are visiting my home country for vacation and my parents are driving me crazy asking and telling me how many things I did wrong and that I should have asked them to do it for me. And I need to call the hotel and tell them when I arrive so that I am sure I still have the reservation, same with the rental car. That's 3 weeks in advance, when I have all communication and email and confirmation received via email. Oh and I should stop being so angry because they just want what's best for me

4. I am tired of babysitting my boyfriends kids and can't catch my breath and when they go to their mother I work, clean, groceries shopping, cook (this my boyfriend does as well) and do the garden work with my boyfriend. I am tired and would like a nice date planned with him once in a while.

5. The constant discussion about his ex-wife. He puts so much energy into that, it makes me sick. And I snapped and screamed at him to stop focusing on her and to focus on us for a change. Of course, I was called too emotional.

6. After 5 years of doing my nails alone I went and did them at a salon. After 2.5 weeks 2 started to lift and I showed my boyfriend that and he not so nicely told me maybe it's my nails and not the technique used, maybe I am just looking to complain about things and this always happened when I did my nails alone. Um yeah, I'm not they expert and didn't charge myself 75‚Ç¨ and 2h to do them so I expect them to last.

7. He is allowed to break things, complain, act not very friendly, use me as a trash bin when he complains about his ex-wife and how fat she is or how tired he is. He is putting all the effort into his things, kids and ex-wife and when I say something, I am too emotional.

All of Manhattan knew about the PECULIAR TRADITION in the Forrester family, New York's wealthiest dynasty‚ÄîEvery new bride had to spend her wedding night alone in the family chapel, praying until dawn. Only those who emerged unharmed the next morning were considered blessed by the Forrester ancestors.

What once had been just a formality turned into a nightmare when Callum Forrester, the current heir, took a bride.

His bride was found dead in the chapel, her throat slashed with a gruesome wound, her limbs grotesquely twisted.

Every security camera was reviewed, but the footage clearly showed no one had entered the chapel that night except the bride herself.

Later, Callum married seven more times over the years, and horrifyingly, each bride met the same fate on her wedding night in that chapel.

Police investigations yielded nothing conclusive, and each death was eventually ruled a suicide.

Rumors spread throughout Manhattan‚Äîsome claimed the Forrester estate was haunted, others whispered about dark rituals. No family would risk sending their daughter there anymore.

But today, I stood before Mrs. Forrester in a crimson dress, my posture graceful yet determined.

""Mr. Forrester is exceptionally handsome,"" I said. ""I've admired him from afar for years. I'm willing to be his ninth wife.""

I looked her directly in the eyes. ""Don't worry. Your ancestors may not have liked the others, but they'll certainly like me.""

\---

My family ran a small bakery on York Avenue.

Before dawn each morning, my sister would help our parents with the work‚Äîkneading dough, preparing fillings, making pastries, brewing coffee. She excelled at everything and never let me help.

""Melody, you're meant for academics,"" she would say. ""Just focus on your studies.""

""We'll support you all the way to success!""

Eight years ago, on the day I was announced as Manhattan's valedictorian.

My sister, dressed in a pristine white gown, shyly boarded the luxurious wedding car sent by the Forrester family.

Everyone envied her good fortune. While serving coffee one morning, she had somehow caught the eye of Callum Forrester, heir to the family fortune, and was now marrying into wealth and privilege.

I was happy for her too, not because of the Forrester fortune, but because of the shy, joyful look on her face before she left:

""Melody, don't worry about me. Callum is truly kind, and his family has been welcoming,"" she said, holding my hands. ""I need to fly higher so you can go further. You'll always be the sister I'll protect with everything I have!""

That night, I dreamed my sister had a beautiful baby who called me ""Auntie"" in the sweetest voice while clutching my shirt.

But the next morning, the shocking news of my sister's death shattered our world.

I raced to the Forrester estate, arriving just as they carried her out on a crude stretcher.

My sister's once delicate hands were now bruised and gray. Her fingertips were bloody, all ten nails forcibly torn off, the flesh raw and mangled.

Despite everyone's attempts to stop me, I yanked back the sheet covering her.

Her death was horrifying‚Äîa gaping wound across her throat, her body twisted unnaturally, her eyes bulging like a fish's.

Her pristine white gown was soaked through with blood, a pool of it staining the stretcher beneath her.

I felt the world spinning as I collapsed to the ground.

But then I heard my father's sickeningly servile tone as he kowtowed to Callum.

""This terrible incident must be Victoria's fault‚Äîshe simply wasn't worthy of the Forrester ancestors' blessing.""

""Mr. Forrester, you're young and successful. You'll definitely find a much better wife in the future. Please don't waste your grief on someone so worthless!""

Though we weren't wealthy, my father had always been kind to us sisters, never speaking harshly to either of us.

When relatives once mocked him for having ""worthless daughters,"" he had grabbed a kitchen knife and confronted them.

Now I couldn't believe these words were coming from his mouth.

""Who would've thought I'd marry a mental case? Killing herself in the chapel on our wedding day‚Äîwhat terrible luck!""

""Get rid of her quickly. The sight is giving me a headache.""

Callum's face was dark with annoyance, showing no grief or pain as he turned to leave.

My sister treasured life above all else and had promised to protect me forever‚Äîhow could she possibly have committed suicide?!

Red-eyed, I moved to confront them, only to be struck hard across the face by my father.

""It's your sister's fault for not being fortunate enough to marry into such a good family!""

""Stop embarrassing yourself and come home with me now!""

I saw stars from the impact as my father dragged me away amid the whispers and stares of onlookers.

The incident caused an uproar throughout Manhattan, prompting a special investigation team from the state.

Shockingly, the conclusion matched Callum's claim‚Äîmy sister had committed suicide.

The Forrester estate had stringent security, and all surveillance footage was perfectly preserved. The recordings clearly showed that after my sister entered the chapel, no one else went in. The audio recordings captured even the sound of mosquitoes flying but recorded no screams.

Chapter 2

Outside the chapel doors and windows, everything remained peaceful until the next morning when Callum and his mother opened the door and discovered my sister's body.

The medical examiner carefully checked every suspicious detail and ruled out homicide.

Everyone calmly accepted this conclusion‚Äîeveryone except me.

After spending the summer break crying, I enrolled at Princeton University as planned.

Not because I cared about my future, but because it had been my sister's greatest wish for me.

I abandoned the popular finance major and instead chose the obscure field of criminal investigation.

After completing my undergraduate studies, I continued with a combined master's and doctoral program. I studied harder than anyone, terrified of missing any knowledge that might help me solve the mystery of my sister's death.

Eight years later, I returned to Manhattan again.

Much had happened with the Forrester family during my absence. After my sister, Callum had married seven more wives.

These seven women came from vastly different backgrounds, with varied appearances and personalities.

Yet each bride had died by apparent suicide in the family chapel on her wedding night.

Particularly noteworthy was the eighth wife, married just six months ago‚ÄîDarla Thompson, a butcher's daughter from the marketplace. She weighed nearly 300 pounds and was strong enough to knock out a grown man with one punch, with a notoriously volatile temper.

Her father had gambling debts of $500,000, and the Forresters, desperate for a bride, had promised her $20 million in cash and ten commercial properties in Marina City if she survived the night.

Darla tried‚Äîbut didn't make it out alive.

Callum had attempted to persuade his family to abandon the chapel ritual, but Mrs. Forrester insisted it was a tradition passed down through generations that could not be broken.

This led to rumors spreading throughout Manhattan‚Äîsome said the Forrester estate was haunted by malevolent spirits determined to end the family line; others whispered that the Forresters were sacrificing brides to feed otherworldly beings in exchange for their incredible wealth.

Whatever the truth, no family across the country was willing to send their daughter there anymore.

Yet on my second day back in Manhattan, I dressed in a striking crimson dress, applied flawless makeup, and appeared at the Forrester estate's entrance.

""Tell your mistress I'm willing to be Callum Forrester's ninth wife.""

News of my request to marry Callum spread through Manhattan like wildfire.

Though Manhattan wasn't small, gossip traveled faster than any virus.

""I heard Melody Vincent just returned yesterday and is already offering to marry Callum Forrester. Both sisters are just gold-diggers!""

""Poor Mr. Vincent‚Äîhe used to brag about how brilliant his daughter was, but look at her now, falling at the feet of money just like her sister.""

""Money aside, those Forrester rumors should give anyone pause. Looks like the Vincent family might lose both daughters to that cursed place!""

Everyone in Manhattan branded me as a shallow gold-digger.

The fact that I was a Princeton graduate with a doctorate made the contrast all the more shocking and thrilling to them.

Inside the Forrester estate, Mrs. Forrester had me brought to her.

""Melody Vincent, do you truly want to marry my son?"" she asked, studying me with interest.

""More certain than gold is pure!"" I replied with a smile.

""Everyone knows Mr. Forrester is refined, gentle, and friendly‚Äînot to mention his net worth recently surpassed ten billion. What reason could I possibly have not to like him?""

Mrs. Forrester responded with a cold laugh.

""I knew you couldn't genuinely care for Callum!""

The disgust in her eyes was unmistakable.

But I knew she had no choice.

""Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush,"" she said.

""You haven't forgotten what happened to your sister in our family chapel eight years ago, have you?""

""During the eight years you've been away, a new bride has died in that chapel each year. What makes you think you'll live longer than they did?""

Chapter 3

Mrs. Forrester's piercing gaze fixed on me.

I smiled faintly.

""Don't worry, Mrs. Forrester. I'm different from those ordinary women. Your ancestors may not have liked them, but they'll certainly approve of me!""

I stared back at her with proud confidence.

She studied me for a long time before finally nodding in agreement.

""Go prepare yourself. Only by surviving tonight can you prove you're different from the others!""

She dismissed me with a wave.

I smiled, knowing all truths would be revealed tonight!

When I returned home, my parents were already waiting.

""What madness is this? Who gave you permission to agree to marry Callum Forrester?!"" My father's face was flushed with anger.

My mother anxiously wiped away tears, her eyes filled with sorrow as she looked at me.

But as I faced my father, I felt nothing.

""Since when have you cared who I marry?"" I asked, staring into his eyes.

""What nonsense! Why wouldn't I care? Don't you know about the Forrester rumors? Going there is practically suicide! Are you trying to put me and your mother in an early grave?""

My father desperately tried to make me see reason.

But I only coldly asked: ""If you truly cared, you wouldn't have let Victoria die in vain back then.""

My father's entire body trembled, his lips quivering.

""Melody, don't speak to your father like that. Your father‚Ä¶"" my mother began.

""Shut up!"" he snapped harshly when my mother tried to defend him.

Then he glared at me intensely.

""Fine, since you've made your decision, I won't interfere anymore.""

""From this day forward, you are no longer my daughter!""

My father drove me from the house despite my mother's desperate pleas, but he remained unmoved.

After leaving, I bowed deeply toward my parents' home.

""Dad, Mom, your daughter has been unfilial.""

""If I can uncover the truth, I promise I'll return to care for you properly!""

I whispered before turning toward the end of the alley.

Callum's wedding procession was even more extravagant than eight years ago‚Äîa line of Rolls-Royces that anyone would envy.

""Well, that's it for the Vincent family line!""

""All those years of fancy education, and that Princeton doctorate isn't worth squat, is it?""

The neighbors lining the alley had all come out to mock me with their cruel taunts.

Yet I boarded the car without hesitation.

The procession moved slowly, taking half an hour to reach the vicinity of the Forrester family chapel.

But when we were still about five hundred yards from the chapel, the driver refused to go any further.

""Miss Vincent, may God be with you. We wouldn't go near that place even if you killed us,"" the driver said, turning to me.

I nodded slightly, then got out and looked ahead.

Perhaps it was the poor weather, or perhaps the area truly was heavy with malevolent energy, but the summer night suddenly felt bone-chillingly cold.

The dark alley ahead resembled a path to hell, yet I walked forward with determined steps.

A few minutes later, I stood before the Forrester family chapel.

The door creaked open, and Mrs. Forrester stood in the entrance beckoning to me.

Perhaps it was her overly pale makeup, but I couldn't shake the impression she resembled a paper effigy.

Mrs. Forrester thrust a prayer book into my hands.

""Go. Recite the prayers,"" she instructed coldly.

""Read them through once, then again. I advise you not to fall asleep‚Äîotherwise... well, who knows what might happen.""

Her eyes held a strange mixture of contempt and pity as she looked at me.

Beside her, Callum emerged from the chapel with several others.

He glanced at me dismissively.

""Your sister was much prettier than you, but it doesn't matter now. I'd marry a pig if it survived the night!""

Callum's face was filled with arrogance.

I silently clenched my fists.

I remained convinced that Callum had done something to my sister!

Now my enemy stood before me, yet I could do nothing‚Äîthe frustration was unbearable.

""May I enter now?"" I asked, looking at Mrs. Forrester.

She didn't speak, merely gesturing for someone to open the inner doors of the chapel.

I walked step by step toward the unknown abyss, my heart growing heavier with each step.

The door slowly closed behind me.

As the last sliver of light disappeared, I found myself in complete darkness.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, candles on the walls ignited, their flickering light making everything around me seem eerily distorted.

My heart raced involuntarily, especially when I first glimpsed the portraits of Forrester ancestors on the walls‚Äîmy fear reached its peak.

Ahead, memorial tablets were arranged neatly, with a prayer mat placed on the floor.

I took a deep breath, gathering my courage to approach, kneeling on the mat.

Then I opened the prayer book, trying to calm myself.

But just as I prepared to begin reciting, something suddenly occurred to me.

""Let me out! Let me out right now!""

""I know what's happening!""

""I know why all those brides died mysteriously!""

I'm happily married with two kids. The wife and I recently started working together for the same company and quickly ran out of things to talk about. We decided to go and find some friends of our own so that we had someone new to chat to and explore our hobbies with.

I love music especially rock and metal, I like most geeky and nerdy things and I have a vast knowledge of jokes. I can be a bit shy to start with but soon warm up when I get to know someone.",1,1750929741.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I‚Äôm learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.

Now there‚Äôs this voice in my head.

It isn‚Äôt always kind.
It‚Äôs definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don‚Äôt settle.
Fix what‚Äôs broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn‚Äôt care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we‚Äôre really chasing under all this noise.

I‚Äôm not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.

So what am I even looking for?

Let‚Äôs keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual ‚Äúhey‚Äù like they didn‚Äôt leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ends it with ‚Äúlol.‚Äù
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay, can we just exist side by side today?‚Äù without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can‚Äôt explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let‚Äôs get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity‚Äù type.
Nope. I‚Äôm talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don‚Äôt have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, ‚ÄúYou got this. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let‚Äôs build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we‚Äôre their therapists
Share playlists like we‚Äôre swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life‚Äôs too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I‚Äôve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I‚Äôve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I‚Äôve walked alone more times than I‚Äôd like. Still do. But I haven‚Äôt stopped hoping
I don‚Äôt want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you‚Äôre:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let‚Äôs start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners of India.
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we‚Äôre all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let‚Äôs make this one a damn good one.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual ‚Äúhey‚Äù like they didn‚Äôt leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ends it with ‚Äúlol.‚Äù
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay, can we just exist side by side today?‚Äù without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can‚Äôt explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.

Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity‚Äù type.
Nope. I‚Äôm talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don‚Äôt have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, ‚ÄúYou got this. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.

Outside study time though?

Let‚Äôs build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we‚Äôre their therapists
Share playlists like we‚Äôre swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life‚Äôs too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I‚Äôve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I‚Äôve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I‚Äôve walked alone more times than I‚Äôd like. Still do. But I haven‚Äôt stopped hoping
I don‚Äôt want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.

So if you‚Äôre:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let‚Äôs start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners of India.
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we‚Äôre all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let‚Äôs make this one a damn good one.

The patient, a 36-year-old tech professional, figured it was just dehydration or too much coffee. Days turned into weeks, and discomfort turned into pain.

A routine checkup turned into a serious diagnosis: an obstructed ureter due to a large kidney stone. Had it been delayed further, it could‚Äôve compromised kidney function permanently.

That‚Äôs when he was referred to **Dr. Sachin Patil**, a trusted **Urologist in Pune** known for managing complex urological issues with minimal intervention. Instead of panic or pushing for surgery, Dr. Patil walked him through a clear, step-by-step plan. Advanced imaging, tailored pain management, and finally, a laser procedure to break down the stone ‚Äî all done with precision and zero hospital stay.

What really stood out? The empathy. Dr. Patil didn‚Äôt just address the physical symptoms. He explained how diet, hydration, and even stress could contribute to recurring stones. Instead of just ‚Äútreating and forgetting,‚Äù he educated. The patient came out not just pain-free, but empowered.

Today, that same techie has switched to a better routine ‚Äî carrying his water bottle everywhere, eating cleaner, and getting regular follow-ups. And whenever someone around him jokes about skipping symptoms, he has one line: ‚ÄúTrust me, go early ‚Äî and go to Dr. Sachin Patil.‚Äù

In a world where many specialists rush appointments and throw jargon, this Urologist in Pune proves that expert care doesn‚Äôt need to be cold or complicated ‚Äî just consistent, clear, and human.",1,1750929338.0,GoodDoctorsinPune,1,1.0,False

1lkvh1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lkvh1v/3_years_and_our_future_thrown_away_with_hardly_a/,3 years and our future thrown away with hardly a reason,"Sadly, I've already written this but Reddit wiped it and I couldn't find it in my drafts so I'm gonna try again.

It started three months ago during a hand in for university. My then partner started focusing mainly on his uni work. I was okay with that it was hard spending less time with them but his work was important. 

He over that time became a really sad person where before he used to be happy bubbly and he would light up the room. He didn't seem to find joy in things anymore. 

He thought at the time it was because he was anxious about his grades and he he didn't have a job and we didn't really have a place to stay. We were gonna have to move out soon. We ended up deciding to stay at my grandma's for about a year so we could save up And get her own place. 

In the second month, he was already doing worse, but he said it was probably because he was really anxious about getting a job there was a bit of a back-and-forth between him and the job so it wasn't certain but eventually he did get a job and it didn't make things better. I think it made things worse because he realised he had so much less time with his friends and we were going to have to move out soon and he really started panicking about losing his friends even though I reassured him that we could visit them as much as he wanted. And within a year of saving money, we could move closer to one of them.

By the third month he had become a shell of a person he was so sad all the time and I thought it was depression because I have struggled with depression my whole life and the signs were pretty similar. So with that in mind I did everything in my power to make him as happy as possible even if it hurt me in the process because I love him so much and I hated seeing why he become used to be such a joyful person with so much love to give and he wasn't anymore.

Two weeks ago, I couldn't take it anymore. I had been going to a separate room to cry and coming back to try and help him but it was taking a toll on me especially since there wasn't any effort on his spot to be with me. I wanted him to spend as much time as possible with his friends and doing things he loved because I knew that that was giving him some semblance of happiness But at the same time I needed him and I asked one day if he could give me just an hour of his day and he said that he couldn't do that he couldn't even do that. On this day we had a small argument we're not fighters we don't really fight if we're upset each other will sit down and talk even though he has really bad issues communicating and I think that's something left over from a pest relationship of his, but we had this argument and I told him I couldn't keep going like this. I needed him to give me a little bit of something back and I was anxious. I was scared so I told him look if you want to break up with me, you need to tell me this is the time you know we're about to move out. We have nothing holding us together really and he didn't reply. I asked because I needed my anxiety so that I've been thinking that he's drifting away and I was scared and usually he'll tell me no and he'll comfort me and he told me everything would be okay, but not this time this time he stayed silent. 

He has issues when it comes to munication he really struggles getting out what he needs to say and so we sat there for 20 minutes in silence while I felt like I was going to die and explode basically because he didn't answer the question if you wanted to end it or not Eventually I started sobbing I couldn't handle it and he hugged me uncomforted me but still didn't answer the question. We spent the next three hours talking as much as we could considering his issues with communicating under pressure. He didn't give me an answer until the end of the three hours he said he wanted to really think on it because he didn't wanna regret the answer he gave those were the most excruciating hours of my life back then.
He eventually said that he didn't think it was our relationship that was making him miserable and he wanted to continue. He cried about the fear of losing his friends and having to move away and not having enough time in the day since he got his job and I comfort him the best I could telling him that we'd only save up for a little bit and then we'd move closer to his friends so he wouldn't feel so alone.

Safe to say after that conversation I felt really unstable in the relationship. I didn't feel secure. You know I was really anxious but that happens when you have a conversation like this so I tried my best to reassure myself and not look for too much validation in him just because he was still going through it. That week leading up to him actually breaking up with me I was bending over backwards to try and make him as happy as possible to hopefully show him that there was some hope.

I ended up calling and booking a hospital appointment so he could get help with this mental health since I was convinced it was depression. I called in because he was too anxious and I just wanted to make his life easier in anyway possible and book the appointment.

I also contacted his parents even though originally he didn't want it I knew he really needed that support and his parents really love him and I knew it would help. I told his mom that he wasn't a really bad place and if she could come down to visit him it'd make a really big difference. 

During that last week there was a lot of signs that I didn't pick up on or I did pick up on but I thought it was my overthinking and my stress of the conversation we had a week ago.

The day before he ended it yeah he had had the worst day at work. He told me he was flying off mental breakdowns. He got home. I hugged him and he cried and then I took him to the shower and then I put him to bed and spent the rest of the day comforting him That was also the day I called his mum to come help she was supposed to come on Sunday and he kept thanking me for reaching out to his mother because even though he didn't want to it seemed to help I tried harder than I had ever tried that day he has a card game he likes to play with his friends called magic the gathering that was never really my thing, but I sat down and I played a game with him and there's 30 minutes was the last time I'd ever see him that happy and it was the first time I had seen him that happy in a really long time It gave me a bit of hope so much so that I insisted we play a proper game the next day and I was going to keep that up. I was going to play with him forever if he needed me to. 

On Saturday, I woke up before him. I made him a big glass of coffee and I was going to make cereal, but we were out of milk. I woke him up. I gave him the glass and I could tell instantly that he was not okay. So I laid there and I cuddled him and I kissed him and I tried to sing to comfort him just anything so we weren't in silence and he wasn't alone with his thoughts. He kept apologising and I didn't understand why because if it's depression, it wasn't his fault right you can't blame a person for something they can't do anything about. 

We had woken up at 8 am that day and by 11 I think he had mustard courage to say what he wanted to say which was that he wanted to break up with me. I messaged my mum as soon as I could ask her to come pick me up because I knew I wouldn't be able to stay in the flat we shared with the things we've collected over the three years. I couldn't get picked up for another two hours so I spent like two hours with him hugging and crying and talking and trying to understand.

Was a really emotional time and I spent that time feeling him as much as I could because physical touch is important to me and I was scared I wasn't gonna get to do that again. Eventually my mum arrived and I quickly grabbed essentials for getting half of the sloth, I should've taken And we said goodbye at the door where I held him and he whispered ""what am I doing?"" Multiple times I comforted him and said if space is what he needs then I would give it to him and don't worry about it.

I spent the next two days in a comatose state crying not being able to breathe not being able to fathom what was happening. I had spent three years with this person I'd given 100% of myself too and loved unconditionally. And then he was gone.

We still called once a day it helped me and he said he also wanted to do it because he wanted to make sure I was it was mostly me crying and him looking guilty and sometimes crying.

At this point, I still had hope he was depressed and that he needed to get out of this and we'd be able to try again you know on Tuesday we called and I cried and I told him how much I was hurting and I told him to try and get better and just keep an open mind so maybe we can try again in the future start over do things slower. That's when he told me that his day was fine he didn't feel sad or depressed anymore like he was the only time he felt sad was either when he walked into a flat and had to grab some stuff before going to stay at a friends or when he talk to me That should've been my sign but I couldn't let go so I begged him to give it a go in the future and I told him that I wouldn't hold him to it he grudgingly agreed and we ended the call so he could go to his doctor's appointment.

Not even 20 minutes after his appointment, he messaged me asking to call again, which is weird because he emphasised the need for distance and how we were only going to call once a day for a little bit I knew then what was coming.

He called and told me he didn't wanna hurt me any more than he already had. He struggled to get the words out and I told him to just do it and he said it's over and he doesn't want to try again. I don't want to say what the next 20 minutes of that conversation was it was me upset and asking him when did he know and him telling me that he knew three months ago when I thought he started becoming depressed is when I think he started morning our relationshi. 

I was angry for the three years we were together. I always emphasise communication and how if you ever felt anything was wrong he needed to tell me straight i've seen what breaking up with someone with no warning does the person getting broken up with and it was one of my biggest fears and even after promising me that that would never happen to us he still did it.

I begged him to tell me why and the most he could say to me was that we weren't compatible, which is something you tell someone after dating them for a month not after three years of planning a life together

He couldn't give me any other answers he barely spoke. He barely looked at the phone when talking to me and he barely even said goodbye because obviously ended that day. I haven't called him since we still have a flat together which we need to be out of by the 10th of the next month Meaning I have to go there and deal with all things and worst of all I still have to communicate with him because we shared items. I sent him a message a professional one about our things and when I was going to go pick some of them up asking him not to be there and asking him to be available over the phone to talk about who was taking what I don't even think he's read that yet. 

On top of losing the person I thought was going to be my life partner I ended up losing most of my friends I wasn't very good at making friends so the first week of university when I found someone I loved and he had friends who were amazing and welcomed to me in with open arms I felt comfortable in that and I truly believe they were my friends, but since the break up, they've hardly reached out I tried giving them a benefit of a doubt and then I went to message one of them and I was blocked which you could imagine how that made me feel on top of everything else.

I've never loved someone like I've loved him. This is my first horrible experience with a break up. It has shared me. It has left me without a future without my safe person without friends without financial stability and without a place to live I didn't just lose a person I lost my entire life that I had built for those three years And I know while I'm feeling horrible he's not feeling that he's feeling okay surrounded by what was our friend group was supporting him he has a job that I helped him get he has a driving license. I helped him get. He's got the money now to find a Nela wherever he wants and he's got All of our friends.

I just never imagined you could love someone and then do something like this to them right after.

I have an immensely supportive family. My mum has been taking care of me so much. I've been following her like a sad lost dog and she's been making sure I at least take a little bit of care of myself. My auntie will come over after work to talk to me and hear me cry and tell me that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I just have to be strong enough together and one of my friends from the previous friend group has been a lifeboat to me. She has called me every day messaged me consistently let me say whatever I want being there while I'm cry multiple times a day. She hasn't come to see me yet because she has a job and a life but she's making plans. 

On Saturday I've been a week and on Saturday I have to go pick up at least half of my stuff from the flat we shared and then later on I'll have to go again but it's going to be immensely difficult for me to walk into that building again to walk into that room, but I know hasn't changed since I left it to pick up the items we shared and bought together and split them up and pack them away and turn around and abandon the life I knew.

I know this is really long and very rarely and there's probably a lot of spelling mistakes since English isn't my first language but I'm so desperate for support that I didn't really know what else to do. Thank you if you've listened even if you don't say anything it means a lot.",1,1750929133.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

My wife is extremely tired. We have 2yo twins, her job is very stressful at the moment, she is also studying a master and she is experiencing back problems for some time.

We hired a person to help us with the house chores because we both were overwhelmed with work and kids. Before anything else, I am not a bum at home, I do most of the rest of the chores so she doesn't have to, I almost always cook and stay late often tyding and cleaning what's needed while she goes to sleep with the kids, etc.

The problem is, I know I am doing what I can, but it's not enough, I can see her struggling after a long day at work, then at home the kids might get fussy and infuriating (as all toddlers do), and while we are very happy with our family life, you all know how exhausting it is.

Then night comes, and our twins are not good sleepers, they wake up almost every night and even when they don't she wakes up for the smallest noise they make (If they don't cry, I don't even notice, I don't have mom spidey-sense). This compounds of the exhaustion.

We don't have any family in our city, so most of the time it's the 4 of us alone, and even if I try to give her alone time, she still needs and wants to be a mom in the evenings and weekends, but sometimes she is too tired even to play or spend quality time with them.

Things I have tried / do:

\- To make her sleep in another room where she cannot hear the kids while I take care of things if they wake up. Does not work very well, still hear them from the other side of the house and can't properly sleep.

\- To make her take alone time, going for coffee with friends, or whatever she wants to. Even naps while I take the kids to play or to a stroll in the park.

\- Force her to go to more physio sessions and doctors, to help with her back and sleep.

\- I take care of the kids whenever they get ill so she does not need to skip work.

Even when family is around, they are not that helpful and we don't currently trust them to take care of the twins while we go out or rest, so it's 24/7 only us most of the time.

I am also exhausted all the time, and she tries to make it easier for me as well, we take care of each other, but I am out of ideas.

 Thanks for reading, worried dad out!",2,1750929021.0,daddit,3,0.75,False

There isn‚Äôt any way that I could say everything I need to in a few short paragraphs, and it wouldn‚Äôt do it justice even if I could. There will be a severely stripped down TLDR at the end but I‚Äôd really appreciate everyone who reads everything to get full context.

I‚Äôm a trans woman (35 as of literally yesterday!) and a couple months ago I moved to Colorado from Texas. Right before I moved here I changed my location on my dating apps to here. I met a guy. It isn‚Äôt his name but we will call him John.

John and I chatted on the app for a couple weeks, before he ultimately asked me out on a date to meet in person. I am very old fashioned with things like this and really like it if the guy is the one to do these things. (I am going to pause here to say that everyone‚Äôs preferences are entirely valid. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúright way‚Äù to do these things, but this is how I personally like it).

Before I continue in the story of John, I will tell you a bit about my history, including my narcissistic, gaslighting, verbally and mentally abusive ex boyfriend:

When I was 4, my bio dad left me on my mother‚Äôs doorstep. He did this because the woman he was seeing at the time didn‚Äôt want kids, anything to do with kids, or kids around at all. So she basically made him choose between her or me. He picked her. And he explained that all to me that morning on my mom‚Äôs porch, as if I would ‚Äúget it‚Äù. He made sure to tell me that when I turn 18 if I want to see him I could buy a plane ticket. He‚Äôs actually married to that woman now, so I guess at least it wasn‚Äôt for nothing. I‚Äôd have felt pretty stupid if they didn‚Äôt make it given what (who) he gave up in order to keep her.

What followed after that was 13 years of extreme physical abuse and mental and emotional torture. I do not use that word lightly or gloss over the depths of what it means. I mean it in every possible sense. I was also made fun of at school and even church. I had ZERO reprieve. My childhood was basically 24/7 HELL, another word I don‚Äôt use lightly. I had no escape and I had no safe space. And I also developed a whole lot of religious trauma because of how the church itself and people in it treated me, all because I was sensitive and ‚Äúboys‚Äù aren‚Äôt supposed to be. Well jokes on them, I found out much later that I never actually was one.

Because of all these factors I developed a lot of co dependent tendencies, and have been in and out of therapy to try and deal with some of them. Remember my bio dad who abandoned me? Well to add onto that I was abandoned by 2 other people I loved, much later in life. My step brother and sister from abusive step dads first marriage who he some kind of way managed to achieve full custody of. After his marriage to my mom ended, he‚Äôd spent time brainwashing them that everything bad that happened was actually because of my mom and our side of the family. I haven‚Äôt heard or seen from either one of them since except once, which was in 2009 in February. My sister is not on any socials, the brother is but never responded to the friend request and message and I sent him years ago. He was a marine then and last I knew he still is.

I made my first attempt on my own life when I was 11, because a girl didn‚Äôt like me back. I just needed someone, ANYONE to like me. I was still severely in denial then, come to find out I don‚Äôt even like women that way. Anyway, what followed was a series of toxic, codependent relationships that never worked out and left a lot of hurt and pain in their wake. They weren‚Äôt all for nothing though, to this day I‚Äôm still friends with my ex fianc√©e who accepts me, and my ex girlfriend of 4 years (the last girl I dated before I did a lot of serious soul searching and started realizing and more importantly ACCEPTING everything) is literally my biggest supporter and cheerleader now. She lives in LA so we haven‚Äôt seen each other in years but we speak semi often and stay in touch.

After that last relationship, when I was still in denial about myself my bio dad reached out on Facebook. The year is now 2022. He tells me his dad (my grandpa on his side who I knew as papa Dan and hadn‚Äôt talked to in decades) had just died. So he was starting to understand what he did to me when he left. And he acknowledged it‚Äôs worse, because his dad just passed away, whereas HE made a conscious decision to abandon his child. As for me, the only single memory I have of papa Dan was when I was 3. We were sleeping over at his house, and I asked my mom for a nightlight. She said she‚Äôd go look for one and in the meantime leave the door cracked with the hall light on. Moments later papa Dan comes in and says verbatim ‚Äúyou‚Äôre scared of the dark? What are you a pussy, some kind of girl?‚Äù then laughs as he shuts the door and turns off the hall light so it doesn‚Äôt even shine underneath.

A few months after bio dad came back into my life, was when I really started accepting myself. I came out in April of 2022 but didn‚Äôt really ‚Äúdo anything about it‚Äù for awhile. Then in October of that same year I got in a car accident that by all means should‚Äôve killed me but I literally walked away from. That was when I realized, I could‚Äôve been dead, mourned, buried and remembered as a person I never was. A person who never existed. A person who at least to me, wasn‚Äôt real and was literally just a mask. I knew then that come hell or high water and whatever it costs me, I HAVE to live my authenticity. And that is exactly what I did.

I made a post coming out on Facebook, ironically it was on Halloween but I didn‚Äôt realize it until after I made the post, and everyone was mostly supportive. I deleted all my pictures and started posting new ones. After a few months I realize I haven‚Äôt heard from bio dad in awhile so I go to his page. And where it should have said ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with a check mark, it was just a big blue button that said ‚Äúadd friend‚Äù. Which means that after his whole speech and apologies, and still remembering what he did to me the first time, he did it to me AGAIN, just because he didn‚Äôt even want to bother to have a conversation or try to understand. He never mentioned a thing, just quietly unfriended me without so much as a word.

I started my social transition that very October, and HRT in January of the following year and never looked back. I‚Äôm now living full time as Victoria at work and social events and everywhere whether they‚Äôre trans events or not. I‚Äôm living full time as a woman and have been for close to 2 years now. I pass pretty well most of the time and couldn‚Äôt even tell you when was the last time I got misgendered, if you don‚Äôt count jackasses online who want to try to ‚Äúown me‚Äù after I tell them I‚Äôm trans because it‚Äôs relevant. If it‚Äôs not relevant I hardly ever mention it.

I‚Äôm always open about the fact I‚Äôm trans with potential dating or romantic partners, because I think that‚Äôs just safer and also honest. All my dating profiles are filled with not only the fact that I‚Äôm trans but details about it, including surgical aspirations etc. because if something like this is a deal breaker I‚Äôd rather know up front and I‚Äôd also rather not set myself up for a violent reaction from a pissed off guy later because he felt ‚Äútricked‚Äù. This approach has not had any issues to this point.

My first few months of transition, and a full calendar year after I came out I didn‚Äôt set foot in a church at all. I was convinced God hated me, that I was broken, etc. it wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt think he was there, I knew he was, and that‚Äôs what hurt. But then I found the Episcopal Church, literally on Easter Sunday. And it is here that I enter into my next chapter. We will call this next guy Jason.

Jason was much older than me, and came into my church in November of 2023. I know how it feels to not know if you‚Äôre welcome so I wanted to make him feel he is. I know how important it is and that‚Äôs all I was trying to do. Later that day I get a friend request and message on fb from Jason. Telling me I‚Äôm really pretty and he wanted to ask me out but was nervous. I didn‚Äôt really want to but I also felt bad if I didn‚Äôt give him a chance, because I‚Äôve been rejected and abandoned so many times. So I agreed.

At the time my brother was using my car, so Jason offered to bring me to work and pick me up. He lived an hour away and I had to be to work at 6am so I felt bad. After a couple weeks I started saying hey, if it‚Äôll be easier why not just stay over on days I work, so you‚Äôre not driving back and forth so much. You can go home on my weekends. And he agreed to that. By this time I was starting to kind of let my shields down and like him, but we weren‚Äôt official yet. Eventually that turned into hey, why don‚Äôt you just not leave, and we wound up living together still with not being official.

I told Jason countless times that I wanted a traditional courting phase but our circumstances seemed to be preventing that. He was helping me a lot getting me to work and back and I felt bad for him driving so much, so I sacrificed what I really wanted to make it easier on him, even though he didn‚Äôt ask. After that, everything changed. I formally agreed to be his girlfriend in January of 2024, and that‚Äôs one of the worst decisions I‚Äôve ever made.

Once we were officially together, it was like he was a different guy. I couldn‚Äôt do anything right, he yelled at me all the time and had blowups even though I begged him to control himself because that doesn‚Äôt do anything but make me freeze up, because I flash back to my childhood. He would of course always apologize but it never lasted. He had prosthetic legs which I already knew when we got together, because of a car accident. Because of that he couldn‚Äôt walk fast or even at what is a normal pace for most people. I could‚Äôve taken greater care, but when we were together in public I‚Äôd accidentally leave him in the dust sometimes. But I always felt bad about it and ran back to where he was and tried to watch my stride, and I really was working on it. Anyway, that became that supposedly I just was embarrassed to be seen with a guy with prosthetic legs so was trying to get away from him whenever we were in public. Which of course is complete fiction.

That relationship lasted 7 months which was 7 months too long. Even after we broke up, I offered to let him stay because I knew he didn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go except live in his car, or money since he was on a fixed disability income. He said no because it would be hard, which I understand that. But then he kept gaslighting me about it and made me feel guilty. He kept telling all our mutual friends at the church that I kicked him out. He threatened every other day to leave, so that particular night I was tired of it and just said cool, why don‚Äôt you then? That‚Äôs not me kicking you out it‚Äôs me not stopping you. I called your bluff and you don‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs all it is. But he goes telling all our friends that I kicked him out knowing he‚Äôd be homeless and I‚Äôm just this heartless bitch of a woman. Most of them quietly unfriended me on fb without a word just like bio dad, and I had to stop going to that church. I was in many ways right back where I started.

The rest of my life in Texas doesn‚Äôt matter. Politics got bad, my mental health was worse, and try as I might I just couldn‚Äôt make myself be ok and feel safe. After one particularly bad mental health crisis in which I developed a solid plan to kms for the first time in over a decade (as in not just passing thoughts), and which resulted in my then current job sending police to my house to do a welfare check and deadname and misgender me in the process, I scared myself so bad, I didn‚Äôt want to go back to that place, and I knew I needed to get out of Texas. Thankfully, the night before in response to a post I made about the situation and asking for prayers and encouragement, a woman I didn‚Äôt know reached out to me and offered me a space in her home, no money, no strings. Just a safe place to start over. I jumped on it.

Now we‚Äôre back in present day. I‚Äôve had my first date with John which was just talking and coffee. At the end of it he kissed me. It was awkward because I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. I‚Äôd never had a real and proper first date with a guy, and prior to that my only experience having an actual relationship with a man post transition was with Jason, which couldn‚Äôt possibly have been a worst first impression. I hadn‚Äôt been with anyone or kissed anyone since Jason and I broke up almost a year prior. So it was awkward.

John could tell, and texted me later that night to apologize. I told him no, the kiss was good and the date was fun, I just wasn‚Äôt expecting it and I don‚Äôt know how normal a kiss after a first date is, but that I liked it. After that we went out again, this time to see the new Lilo and Stitch live action. He opens up to me about his past and says he has a history of rushing into things too fast with a woman. He said he regretted his kiss and just wants to hang out without trying to make it be anything. I told him I understood. But when I‚Äôm with this guy‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs real. There‚Äôs definitely a spark there at least on my side.

I‚Äôd never want to pressure him into anything or make him feel bad and I told him that. At this point we‚Äôre still hanging out as friends. We‚Äôve been out together several times, and he‚Äôs still a gentleman even though we aren‚Äôt together. He recently told me he doesn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs ready for a relationship at all, and he doesn‚Äôt want to mislead me because he knows I like him because I told him. I know this isn‚Äôt some kind of manipulation because in a moment of weakness I actually offered him to mess around and he said he doesn‚Äôt want to, because he likes me as a friend right now. And he said even if he could handle just having casual sex with me, he knows I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it without getting more attached emotionally, and he was right.  And I knew it because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always been. I‚Äôve even had ex girlfriends make fun of me telling me I‚Äôm ‚Äúlike a girl‚Äù when it comes to sex.

We went to a Rapids (soccer game) a couple weeks ago and afterwards just stood in the parking lot for over an hour talking. There were tears. There was honesty. There were hugs. There was a kiss I wanted so badly at the end that never happened. I told him I appreciate him being so honest and forthcoming, and not just using me as a time killer without caring what it‚Äôs doing to my feelings. He made it clear I can walk away from our friendship at any time, and also that he doesn‚Äôt want me to wait for him, because it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to me and he would feel bad even though I‚Äôd tell him not to.

Now we‚Äôre at tonight. We‚Äôre at the Rockies game and it starts raining. There‚Äôs chaos and pandemonium as everyone tries to get under a covering or awning. It‚Äôs really coming down and the crowd is tightly packed and barely moving. We finally make it to a covering but it‚Äôs already jam packed full, so I‚Äôm actually standing halfway in the rain still. He notices, and uses his arm to gently move me under the awning while telling me ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you come under here and I‚Äôll stand there‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt expecting rain so I was just in a tanktop. Even under normal circumstances I get cold easy but it was a hot day. The rain and wind turned on those symptoms fast.

After some minutes I decide I just can‚Äôt stand there, and we need to walk around the ballpark and look for a shop where I can buy a jacket or sweater of some kind. (We did eventually find one, but that isn‚Äôt the point of the story). Everyone is walking a hundred different directions packed close together. I don‚Äôt want to lose him so I instinctively grab his arm as he‚Äôs in front of me, hooking my elbow under his. I quickly realize what I did and apologize and ask if it‚Äôs ok, he says yes.

In that moment it hits me. This is everything I ever wanted. I feel safe with this guy even as chaos happens around. I‚Äôm holding onto him and he is holding onto me. I‚Äôm just in a normal woman man relationship with this guy, except I‚Äôm not. I quickly realize that I‚Äôm fantasizing, but I can‚Äôt stop. John really is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted in a man, but he doesn‚Äôt feel the same way, not because of me, but because he doesn‚Äôt want anyone right now, regardless.

I confess all this to him later as we‚Äôre walking back to the car after we escape the chaos inside the ballpark. He tells me he‚Äôs sorry, and he wishes there was something he could do. He offered to stop hanging out with me or talking to me if it will help, I told him not to do that. When he brought me back I asked him if he would like to come inside and meet my roommates, the couple who gave me a way out of Texas. And by now they‚Äôre much more to me than that. They are becoming a mother and father figure to me. I still have a good relationship with my real mom and stepdad, who I consider to be my dad and call him such. I call him stepdad here for the sake of context and to not induce confusion.

It was also my birthday, the game was my present.

Anyway, he agreed to come in. He introduced himself to them, and he shook my roommate that I will call James (the boyfriend of the woman who actually reached out to me in the first place when I was still in Texas), and they were talking. About me and about other things. I told them about what John did at the game, bringing me in from the rain and taking my place. James comments to him good job, that‚Äôs how it should be and kind of smiled. John agreed and said he‚Äôd never not handle that situation that way.

So now I‚Äôm home, I have to be up for work in an hour and a half for a 12 hour shift and I can‚Äôt sleep, because I‚Äôm grieving the breakup of a relationship that never existed in the first place. We‚Äôre friends and I know that. I‚Äôve always known that ever since we had that conversation. But I‚Äôve been seeing for weeks now and especially tonight, everything I want out of a relationship with a man. I actually told myself this must be how other girls dating good guys feel. Except they actually have the good guy and I don‚Äôt.

Part of me feels bad. Part of me feels greedy. God has already done so much for me in just these last couple years, and here I am saying ‚Äúby the way could you throw a man in there too while you‚Äôre at it?‚Äù It feels ungrateful, but I can‚Äôt help it. I want someone to share my life with, a companion, and John is perfect for it, except he isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know as things currently stand John isn‚Äôt an option and I would never even dream of trying to manipulate him or make him feel guilty or pressure him into a relationship he doesn‚Äôt want. I just‚Ä¶. I want love in my life. True romantic love. I want to feel how other women in good and healthy relationships feel. 

TLDR: I was abused as a kid by my stepdad and abandoned by my bio dad and step brother and sister. I transitioned late in life at 32 (I‚Äôm now 35) and so have only had a seriously relationship with one guy which was toxic and abusive from his end and basically the whole thing was just really really bad. I have a new guy who I‚Äôm friends with and he‚Äôs everything I want, but he‚Äôs not looking to change his single status anytime soon. He‚Äôs a gentleman, treats me right and even does those chivalry things which I adore. I feel selfish asking for God to throw a boyfriend in on top of everything else he‚Äôs already done for me over the last few years especially, as if it‚Äôs not enough and I need more. As if I‚Äôm not grateful.

Thank you everyone who took the time to read everything. I know it was a lot, figuratively and literally. I means the world to me that you took the time to really try to understand. God bless all of you.",1,1750928583.0,TransChristianity,0,0.67,False

1lkv9ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WellnessbyLila_/comments/1lkv9ca/wellness_weight_loss_navigating_plateaus_breaking/,(Wellness & Weight Loss): Navigating Plateaus: Breaking Through Stalls on Your Wellness Journey,"[In the dynamic pursuit of wellness and sustainable weight management, there often comes a moment that can feel incredibly frustrating: the plateau. You're diligent with your nutrition, consistent with your workouts, yet the scale stubbornly refuses to budge, energy levels feel stagnant, and motivation wanes. Experiencing a plateau is not a sign of failure; it's a natural, albeit challenging, part of any long-term transformation. ](https://preview.redd.it/z8fvvhipk89f1.jpg?width=5617&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83fd85a8421173ac01930cee45f73a8dce2904b1)

Understanding the underlying reasons for these stalls and equipping yourself with strategic solutions is the ultimate luxury‚Äîa testament to your resilience, adaptability, and unwavering commitment to your well-being, empowering you to break through barriers and reignite your progress with renewed vigor.

A plateau occurs when your body adapts to your current routine, and the initial rapid progress slows or stops. This adaptation is a sign of your body becoming more efficient, which is good, but it means you need to adjust your approach to continue seeing results. Common reasons for plateaus include:

* **Metabolic Adaptation:** As you lose weight, your body requires fewer calories to maintain itself. Your metabolism might also slow slightly as it becomes more efficient.
* **Reduced NEAT:** As you become lighter and potentially less stressed, your non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT ‚Äì incidental daily movement) might subtly decrease.
* **Consistency Creep:** Small deviations in diet or missed workouts can accumulate over time, undermining your calorie deficit.
* **Increased Stress & Poor Sleep:** These factors can disrupt hormones (like cortisol) that impact metabolism and fat storage.
* **Overtraining/Under-recovery:** Pushing too hard without adequate rest can lead to fatigue, hormonal imbalance, and plateaus.
* **Undereating:** Paradoxically, severely restricting calories can sometimes slow metabolism and make fat loss harder.
* **Lack of Training Variation:** Your muscles and body adapt to the same exercises, making them less challenging and less effective over time.

Recognizing these potential culprits is the first step toward strategically breaking through the stall.

# Breaking Through with Luxury & Logic: Strategies for Renewed Progress

Navigating a plateau requires a thoughtful, multi-pronged approach that re-evaluates your current strategies and introduces smart adjustments.

1. **Re-Evaluate Your Nutrition with Precision:**  
   * **Recalculate Calories & Macros:** As you lose weight, your caloric needs decrease. Re-evaluate your calorie target and macronutrient ratios to ensure you're still in an appropriate deficit.
   * **Track Everything Accurately:** This is where a food scale becomes crucial. Ensure you're not underestimating calories or overestimating protein.
   * **Consider a ""Diet Break"" or ""Refeed"":** A planned, temporary increase in calories (especially carbs) for 1-2 weeks can help reset hormones, boost metabolism, and improve mental adherence without undoing progress.
   * A[ **Precise Digital Food Scale**](https://www.amazon.com/Greater-Goods-Digital-Coffee-Scale/dp/B09B4CB7C1/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=BFBHUEY94V85&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._LbeeKl4k3ojZrr3WFSj1g4k8Nyn7EwWEU1zaZW7mJyPidy0mtU8xZcsQvLyk9GXTNzEcH7X4AdgXLzloglhKRH0YaNRZcNk1d4syPQ_LcCpd7f-ZJdJvYt1DGDeFjXZ1_E2BYrEYXwNDuLld499SF-JiVVBCboieZJBc5gy9cGg62_g7okPbVb_qc8L5rr4Ay9BHbSrsZgsjQnEH7JEBVPyB9kwcbcGpCmmew9MvV6YG9FJ7CDBu8W6F4tjUU7HS2A-Zxy0H7KQ0KIpTh-DnOr5bamrUYFrGogkG2hPG4o.z7xB9lDlFGSDJqdd117V9jNWSY15maz4ElD4SJPaSJM&dib_tag=se&keywords=Precise%2BDigital%2BFood%2BScale&qid=1750921946&sprefix=hydrating%2Bskincare%2Bproduct%2Caps%2C796&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1) is an indispensable tool for navigating plateaus. It eliminates guesswork in portion sizing, allowing you to accurately track your caloric and macronutrient intake and make precise adjustments, which is crucial for identifying and overcoming metabolic stalls.
2. **Optimize Your Training:**  
   * **Increase NEAT:** Actively look for ways to move more throughout your day (standing desk, walking calls, stairs).
   * **Vary Your Workouts:** Introduce new exercises, change rep ranges, increase intensity, try a new class, or explore different forms of movement. Challenge your body in new ways.
   * **Progressive Overload:** Ensure you're consistently challenging your muscles in strength training (lifting heavier, more reps, more sets).
   * To inject new challenges and stimulate fresh adaptations in your workouts, a[ **High-Quality Set of Resistance Bands**](https://www.amazon.com/Undersun-Fitness-Latex-Exercise-Resistance/dp/B07DZXTCCM/ref=sr_1_5_sspa?crid=3S7L78O4BGCS7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.c4AB25M3woa428QcOm3O1XJu9EhLrwtZ8ZNwvrfASmmzHkHWZRGPe-Bh6KCzOU208ZZ5PAqhkElBkMcjRp5PAW4OrmvpFFy4G9_q_BYzdPPScl3V2ih6RD9RfAZfkeT7bqsgU9vy2GgQ1JEeYexdjzwOU-lsZ5bXU9t7mK9Kjp9ohgIkXHtqeh3YrxlL6bvkSnVkgbwDIdUyoLUaOIZH__k6m-r2f5ew7wLq_p5TSctZ4o4B1DZddNqR2Ih-vYtjir9PMzCl1ynBNGwuKEikh7hs6FgW65Mx-ZyMJ0PZ1GE.n4YDnUeZj_lh1GvqLfVShWFao4TLkAk1RjxJ-Jqo7Ew&dib_tag=se&keywords=High-Quality+Set+of+Resistance+Bands&qid=1750922016&sprefix=high-quality+set+of+resistance+bands%2Caps%2C454&sr=8-5-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1) with varying tension levels can be a luxurious and versatile tool. They allow you to add resistance to bodyweight exercises, create new strength challenges, and introduce variety to your routine, helping to shock your system out of a plateau.
3. **Prioritize Recovery & Stress Management:**  
   * **Optimize Sleep:** Ensure 7-9 hours of quality sleep. Sleep deprivation impacts hormones crucial for metabolism.
   * **Active Recovery & Rest Days:** Don't neglect these. Adequate recovery prevents overtraining and allows for adaptation.
   * **Stress Reduction:** Implement daily practices to lower cortisol, which can hinder fat loss.
   * To ensure restful, hormone-balancing sleep, a[ **Comfortable Sleep Mask**](https://www.amazon.com/DROWSY-Face-Hugging-Padded-Therapy-Darkness/dp/B08NHHDLT6/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DZGQmkKLbspIWzcnuLthlVjZoMYBqCXXNoU64WqNrrTxQZg6E_7HWvg1id2vIGRCPJs77qorKZUJpvmArjF1UKZMcfPcSnW_l3ix_kXYyaVvsd_nJ1nB8T-6KbBgE7bU5V1i07URkbPmq-BMf8gdhnRncaerziBkiuDo37NG1HpA-_ZgmlwUup8m-MBxDeXv9Ph0nR0fg0nQwpjYBqAqBspp9CLKpd4qG9wyKN9YEyU3IYu-vFXpLViI_Re5HPWN7BhUoBqsCpTVCx9WGfgelGafRtwmzwXbbE_S8JxSRQI.0ro3m5_dL7GTlOhiAqIU7oYLUhOymJsV-Iq6MmSJn3A&dib_tag=se&keywords=Comfortable+Sleep+Mask&qid=1750922035&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1) is an excellent tool for blocking out light and promoting deeper, more restorative rest, which is crucial for breaking through plateaus influenced by hormonal imbalances.
4. **Practice Patience & Consistency:** Plateaus are temporary. Stick to your plan, trust the process, and focus on consistency. Don't fall back into old habits out of frustration.  
   * A[ **Wellness Journal**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://amzn.to/journal-re-evaluation-example-link) is a powerful tool for navigating plateaus. It allows you to document your food intake, exercise, sleep, mood, and perceived energy levels, helping you identify subtle changes or inconsistencies that might be contributing to the stall and re-evaluate your approach.

As a newly opened cafe the food was tasty as well the service was quite fast. Pricing wise it was cheap as the target audience is students. The cafe has a laid back and relaxing vibe which makes the overall ambience more peaceful. The serene feels in the evening or morning and soothing peacock squawks just adds up to that.

I really felt alone in this all but now, I don‚Äôt know. This seems to be expanding in territories that are hitting cords long glazed over.  Part of me is screaming to run but the other part is laughing. Taunting me. Telling me cycles and cycles. I want to break to free of it all.

Has Reddit ever just vanished your post after clicking the post button? Because this happened‚Äî and many other strange things. I hope this time it gets through. 

**

I sat at the bar, the amber liquid swirling in my glass, but all I could see were her eyes‚Äîmilky and hollow, the same eyes that stared back at me the night my father died. I‚Äôd tried to astral travel for days, setting up my mirrors and cameras in the living room, sinking into that old chair, asking the walls where Sarah was. But they never answered. Night after night, I stayed trapped‚Äîsolid walls, no escape. Frustration turned to desperation, and one night, I drowned it all in whiskey. That was when it happened‚Äîwhen the question left my lips, and for the first time, the room let go. Everything was black, but far off, I caught a flash of light‚Äîglowing, alive, in a field I barely recognized. Then it was gone. Like her. Like him. Always out of reach.  

So here I am again. Same plan, same frustration, but this time, I‚Äôm not stopping at comfortable drunk‚ÄîI‚Äôm aiming to blackout. Because if that‚Äôs what it takes to get Sarah back, so be it. The whiskey burned on the way down, my focus sharpening into a single thought: her. I raised the glass again, ready to empty it, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. 

Turning, I didn‚Äôt know what to expect, but it wasn‚Äôt her‚Äîa woman older than the bar itself, with wild silver hair braided back and a name that hit like a warning: Liora. She smiled like she‚Äôd known me all my life, and maybe she had. My family always had secrets, and Liora looked like the kind of woman you‚Äôd find wrapped in them‚Äîtoo familiar, too knowing. But why? And why now?

Liora. Her name hit me like a sharp wind, carrying years I‚Äôd buried under everything else. She wasn‚Äôt just someone I knew‚Äîshe was a storm I weathered when my mom got sick. Her hair was wild back then, just like now, and she had this pull, this energy my mom clung to like it could heal her. My mom trusted her, so I did too. And when things got hard, Liora was there, painting distractions with her words and her smile. ‚ÄúYou need a break,‚Äù she‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúCome over. Let‚Äôs party‚Äù. At the time, it felt like kindness. Now, it feels like something else. She took me‚Äîmy virginity, my sanity, my focus on what really mattered. And I let her, because she made me believe it was what I needed. She made it easy to forget my mom was dying and I was the one meant to be there for her. But Liora wasn‚Äôt just another face. She had a life outside me‚Äîa life that I didn‚Äôt understand until I started to see too much.

I didn‚Äôt put it together at first. The people at her place, the way they came and went‚Äîit all seemed normal when I was young, na√Øve. She‚Äôd call them her friends, and I believed her. But as I got older, the truth came into focus, sharp and ugly. Liora ran a brothel. And somehow, I was right in the middle of it‚Äîfixing things, following her orders, doing whatever she asked because I couldn‚Äôt bear to go home to what was waiting there.  

I saw her sitting there, on the edge of the bed, and for the first time in my life, my mother looked small. Her shoulders hunched, her head bowed like everything that made her her had been drained out and left on the floor. My mother wasn‚Äôt the kind of woman who broke. She was steel, fire, the kind of person who could silence a room with one look. But in that moment, none of that was true. She sat there like someone else entirely‚Äîsomeone beaten.  

I didn‚Äôt say a word. Didn‚Äôt confront her. Didn‚Äôt confront Liora. What would I have even said? That I didn‚Äôt see this coming? That I let her carve up my family, piece by piece, while I stood there too blind to notice? I walked out instead. Left my mother in that room. Left Liora in the doorway, wearing that smile‚Äîthe kind that says she always wins. And maybe she had.  
I still see my mom‚Äôs face, even now. It never leaves me. Every time, I feel like I‚Äôm back in that hallway, unable to move, unable to breathe. Then I see Liora, and it‚Äôs worse‚Ä¶

Her hand tapped my shoulder, light but deliberate, like she was claiming her space before I even turned. When I did, I felt my pulse spike‚Äîthere she was, Liora, framed by the dim glow of the bar lights, looking exactly as I remembered and yet somehow more dangerous. I stiffened, my face blank, forcing myself to tilt my head like I had no idea who she was. Maybe it would work. Maybe she‚Äôd believe it and leave me alone. But then her lips curved into a grin, slow and sharp, the kind that told me she‚Äôd already won. She leaned closer, her voice low but clear, cutting right through the noise: 'Recognition isn‚Äôt the problem, Elio. It‚Äôs forgetting what you shouldn‚Äôt have left behind.

I held her gaze just long enough to make it clear I wasn‚Äôt afraid‚Äîat least that‚Äôs what I told myself. Her smile stayed sharp, her eyes studying me like I was an equation she‚Äôd already solved. 'You always were good at running, Elio,' she said, and my breath hitched, but I kept my face blank. 'What is it you‚Äôre running from this time? The girl? The lights? Yourself?' I wanted to walk away, to pretend the words didn‚Äôt cut, but my feet wouldn‚Äôt move. 'You‚Äôll never get there like this,' she said, leaning closer, her voice so low it wound into my spine. ‚ÄòFollow me, Elio, and I‚Äôll give you the answers you‚Äôre looking for, but‚Äî‚Äô her grin widened, sharp enough to draw blood, ‚Äò‚Äîyou should know, the doors I‚Äôll show you don‚Äôt close once they‚Äôre open.‚Äô She stepped back, just enough to let the air between us breathe, then turned, her head tilting the way it always had‚Äîlike she knew I‚Äôd follow.

I followed her into the forest, my steps heavy, my mind screaming at me to turn back, but her presence pulled me in like gravity. The trees towered over us, their shadows stretching long under the moonlight, and when she finally stopped, she turned to me, her eyes gleaming like she‚Äôd found something precious. Before I could react, she pressed me against a tree, her hands sliding up my chest, slow and deliberate, her touch searing through the fabric like it could burn straight to my skin. 'God, Elio,' she murmured, her voice almost a purr, her lips curling into that predatory smile. 'You don‚Äôt even realize, do you? What you are. What you could be.' Her weight leaned into me, her breath warm against my neck, and just as the edges of my vision started to blur, she whispered, 'Let go.'  

When I woke up, I was back at my house. My head pounded with the kind of pain you can‚Äôt shake, every beat stabbing like a reminder of how wrong everything felt. The room smelled faintly of perfume‚Äînot mine, and not hers either. I pushed myself up, my body aching, and that‚Äôs when,

I saw it. On the floor near the edge of the bed‚Äîa pair of lace underwear, tangled like they‚Äôd been left in a rush. My stomach twisted. The sheets were a mess, and there was this undeniable heaviness in the air, like something I couldn‚Äôt name had happened here, something I couldn‚Äôt undo. My chest burned as I scanned the room, but it was empty‚Äîno signs of her, whoever she was. Not Liora. That much I knew. But the rest? Blanks. Just empty space in my head where the night should‚Äôve been.  

I stumbled to the bathroom, gripping the sink as I caught my reflection in the mirror. My shirt was wrinkled, collar stretched like someone had pulled too hard, and there was this faint smear of lipstick on my neck‚Äîlipstick I didn‚Äôt recognize. The pounding in my skull grew worse. I turned back to the bed, the soft dent in the pillow where another head had clearly rested staring back at me like an accusation. 

I stared at the bed, at the tangled sheets and the lace that didn‚Äôt belong to her‚Äîor anyone who mattered. The twins had taken another, and I‚Äôd let them, hadn‚Äôt I? 

Given her up like she was nothing, like it didn‚Äôt cost me anything, because in moments like that, it never did. I sat there, head splitting, hands shaking, and suddenly I was back in another room, another time, watching my first girlfriend laugh, her smile sharp enough to cut glass. She was the kind of beautiful that turned heads everywhere; a model with angles so perfect they didn‚Äôt seem real. But she wasn‚Äôt real. Not to me. Not the way I should‚Äôve wanted her to be.  

I cheated on her constantly. Not because I wanted anyone else‚ÄîGod, no‚Äîbut because sex was never about wanting. It was something I did, like eating, like breathing. It didn‚Äôt mean anything, at least not to me. But it meant something to her. And every little betrayal chipped away at us until all that glittering beauty and promise turned to ash. We almost got married once. Almost. When it fell apart, though, I didn‚Äôt grieve. I didn‚Äôt stop. 

I spent ...years swimming in the wreckage, cycling through partners like they were postcards from different lifetimes. A neighbor‚Äôs wife‚ÄîI told myself it was comfort we both needed. A woman from work‚Äîshe brought coffee to meetings and once brought me home. A stranger at a bar‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt remember her name, but I could still see the way she leaned in, eyes shining like she had figured me out. It was all so easy, so distant, so nothing.  

I thought I closed that door. Locked it, sealed it, buried it beneath the life I worked so hard to build‚Äîor at least pretend to build. But standing here now, staring at this foreign piece of lace in my hand, I wasn‚Äôt so sure anymore. The tangled sheets were a mess, but I was messier. No matter how hard I tried, those ghosts kept circling back.

Then it hit me, like a sharp pull from the dark‚ÄîI remembered her. Liora. Her smile was a blade, carving through the moments I thought I‚Äôd forgotten, stitching them together into something I couldn‚Äôt quite look at yet. This? The lace, the headache, the blank spaces where the night should‚Äôve been‚Äîthis was her doing. It had her fingerprints all over it, haunting, deliberate. I could feel her presence now, like smoke curling around my throat, choking the questions I didn‚Äôt have answers to. But answers‚ÄîGod, I‚Äôd need them. And later, when the haze cleared, I knew I‚Äôd be seeking her again, for better or worse, because with Liora, it was never anything else.

I'm on my way to confront Liora at her castle-like home just outside of town. But l've stopped at the hill just beneath it, drinking, smoking, trying to steady myself. I know I should keep a clear head, but something about this‚Äîabout her‚Äîit won't let me. I can't say it's not helping my hangover. This strange feeling of being in tune with something heavy but focused, focused on what? I can't say.
I'll let you know how it goes when I finally walk through that door.

1lkv80f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lkv80f/parents_decided_to_completly_ghost_me/,Parents decided to completly ghost me,"Hey, everyone! Recently I (25M) had a fight with my parents about smoking and they decided to ghost me completly for the past 3 days.

Context: I have always been succesful academicaly. I finished uni head of class, 2 days ago I aced the masters and yesterday I signed in for PhD in engineering. I love my parents and have always respected them. I tried to make them pround. I have a brother with Down Syndrome (which is light, not really impairing quality of life) which I love and care for. At age 7, my parents sat me down and told me that from now on I will be the main investment for them, at least academically speaking. That moment kind of snapped me into a very early maturization process. They always had a very micromanagement kind of style, yet I always tried to remain independent. Example: A year ago they threw a tantrum that I am abandoning them because I don‚Äôt come in my home town every weekend‚Ä¶

Alas, the last 2 years have been really rough on me with work and personal matter (relationships etc.). After the last breakup 3 months ago I decided to try smoking a brand which I saw at a colleague (Dannemann Moods Sunshine). I had moments where I was curious about smoking throughout my life but never tried until that point. Friend told me I‚Äôm not really a ‚Äòsmoker‚Äô because I dont feel the urge to smoke, more like I just do it recreationally (1 pack of 10 in a day or none at all for a couple of days). My parents found out I smoke and my mom had a mental breakdown, started cursing me, saying degrading stuff, that I had surely turned to drugs (which I am totally against), threatened me that they will let me strugle by myself from now on etc., which didn‚Äôt really get to me as I have a stable and well paying job, my own house (with which they helped me buy, but 90% of the mortgage is on me). We all stopped having vacations as we used to so we could financially concentrate on paying off the mortgage. They told me that me paying for cigarillos is an insult as we are trying to save money. Even so, none of us abstained from buying things, guilty pleasures and so on. The thing that made me snap was that 2 days ago I had my masters exam which I aced. I messaged them about it and they couldn‚Äôt give a shit. Yesterday the same thing about signing in for PhD, they didn‚Äôt bother saying shit. Yesterday, after signing in I went over to a restaurant over the street to treat myself a coffee and a piece of cake. I sat down by myself and tried to keep it in from crying because I was really happy for myself, yet it was a bit sour because the 2 people I love and looked up to decided to treat me like shit in such moments.

I don‚Äôt think I deserve this treatment. I have always made them proud with who I am and what I‚Äôve accomplished so far. The fact that I started smoking seemed like everything I‚Äôve ever done right was wiped out instantly.

I get their point about spending money on cigarillos, which are not all that expensive (5-6 euros) because I order online to get better deals. Still, ghosting me and treating me like this during very important moments of my life for such a thing at 25 YEARS OF AGE seems insane to me.

TLDR: AITA in this situation?

Now, for various reasons (mostly office relocation) the job doesn't offer me the life I want. I feel trapped, I have no dependents but I do have a mortgage.
I have been considering quitting full time work and studying a PhD full time with a part time job.
The PhD subject is not one that will lead to a good job automatically.
I have no idea where to start, if I should just plough on with this job and deal with the extra commute time, if I should persue the studying. I am not a person that needs luxeries, but I struggle to function if I don't feel fulfilled. I currently live alone with a house that's if anything a bit too large for me that needs a decent amount of work doing to it (that I am struggling to keep up with), located in a small town. I have this vision of studying in the city, in a flat, with me and my cat, spending time walking, coffee with friends, reading/watching documentaries. Right now it's DIY, travelling an hour just to grab a drink with someone, full rat race feelings etc. My mental health is for sure suffering. But PhDs are notoriously bad for mental health too.

But then came the pain. First, a dull throb in her lower back that wouldn‚Äôt go away. Then the sharp, shooting cramps that traveled down her legs, making stairs unbearable and sleep impossible. She shrugged it off for months, blaming it on stress, age, bad posture‚Äîanything but something serious.

Over-the-counter meds didn‚Äôt help. Physiotherapy sessions gave her hope, but the relief never lasted. Each day became a battle: sitting at work felt like torture, and even bending to tie her shoes brought tears. ‚ÄúNothing seemed to work,‚Äù she thought, watching the life she loved shrink around her.

She started avoiding friends. Stopped going out. Her world got smaller with every step she couldn't take.

Doctors told her it was sciatica, or maybe a slipped disc, or possibly arthritis‚Äîbut no one could say for sure. Each test led to more confusion, more pills, more frustration. ‚ÄúI was about to give up,‚Äù she admitted one night, holding back tears in front of her partner.

Then one day, while doomscrolling during yet another sleepless night, she came across a forum thread discussing advanced diagnostic care. Something about it made her pause. Desperate, she booked one more appointment‚Äîjust one.

That‚Äôs when she met **Dr. Vishal Patil**.

He didn‚Äôt rush her. He listened. Really listened. Asked about her routines, her lifestyle, how long she'd been carrying this pain. Within an hour, he‚Äôd ordered a high-resolution scan most others had overlooked. The results weren‚Äôt just data‚Äîthey were answers.

The treatment that followed wasn‚Äôt dramatic or invasive. It was precise, personalized, and rooted in understanding. She started feeling the difference in weeks. Sleep returned. Her smile followed.

One morning, she stood at her window, coffee in hand, and realized she hadn‚Äôt felt that familiar stabbing pain in days. She laced up her shoes and went for a walk‚Äîjust around the block. But it was everything.

There isn‚Äôt any way that I could say everything I need to in a few short paragraphs, and it wouldn‚Äôt do it justice even if I could. There will be a severely stripped down TLDR at the end but I‚Äôd really appreciate everyone who reads everything to get full context.

I‚Äôm a trans woman (35 as of literally yesterday!) and a couple months ago I moved to Colorado from Texas. Right before I moved here I changed my location on my dating apps to here. I met a guy. It isn‚Äôt his name but we will call him John.

John and I chatted on the app for a couple weeks, before he ultimately asked me out on a date to meet in person. I am very old fashioned with things like this and really like it if the guy is the one to do these things. (I am going to pause here to say that everyone‚Äôs preferences are entirely valid. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúright way‚Äù to do these things, but this is how I personally like it).

Before I continue in the story of John, I will tell you a bit about my history, including my narcissistic, gaslighting, verbally and mentally abusive ex boyfriend:

When I was 4, my bio dad left me on my mother‚Äôs doorstep. He did this because the woman he was seeing at the time didn‚Äôt want kids, anything to do with kids, or kids around at all. So she basically made him choose between her or me. He picked her. And he explained that all to me that morning on my mom‚Äôs porch, as if I would ‚Äúget it‚Äù. He made sure to tell me that when I turn 18 if I want to see him I could buy a plane ticket. He‚Äôs actually married to that woman now, so I guess at least it wasn‚Äôt for nothing. I‚Äôd have felt pretty stupid if they didn‚Äôt make it given what (who) he gave up in order to keep her.

What followed after that was 13 years of extreme physical abuse and mental and emotional torture. I do not use that word lightly or gloss over the depths of what it means. I mean it in every possible sense. I was also made fun of at school and even church. I had ZERO reprieve. My childhood was basically 24/7 HELL, another word I don‚Äôt use lightly. I had no escape and I had no safe space. And I also developed a whole lot of religious trauma because of how the church itself and people in it treated me, all because I was sensitive and ‚Äúboys‚Äù aren‚Äôt supposed to be. Well jokes on them, I found out much later that I never actually was one.

Because of all these factors I developed a lot of co dependent tendencies, and have been in and out of therapy to try and deal with some of them. Remember my bio dad who abandoned me? Well to add onto that I was abandoned by 2 other people I loved, much later in life. My step brother and sister from abusive step dads first marriage who he some kind of way managed to achieve full custody of. After his marriage to my mom ended, he‚Äôd spent time brainwashing them that everything bad that happened was actually because of my mom and our side of the family. I haven‚Äôt heard or seen from either one of them since except once, which was in 2009 in February. My sister is not on any socials, the brother is but never responded to the friend request and message and I sent him years ago. He was a marine then and last I knew he still is.

I made my first attempt on my own life when I was 11, because a girl didn‚Äôt like me back. I just needed someone, ANYONE to like me. I was still severely in denial then, come to find out I don‚Äôt even like women that way. Anyway, what followed was a series of toxic, codependent relationships that never worked out and left a lot of hurt and pain in their wake. They weren‚Äôt all for nothing though, to this day I‚Äôm still friends with my ex fianc√©e who accepts me, and my ex girlfriend of 4 years (the last girl I dated before I did a lot of serious soul searching and started realizing and more importantly ACCEPTING everything) is literally my biggest supporter and cheerleader now. She lives in LA so we haven‚Äôt seen each other in years but we speak semi often and stay in touch.

After that last relationship, when I was still in denial about myself my bio dad reached out on Facebook. The year is now 2022. He tells me his dad (my grandpa on his side who I knew as papa Dan and hadn‚Äôt talked to in decades) had just died. So he was starting to understand what he did to me when he left. And he acknowledged it‚Äôs worse, because his dad just passed away, whereas HE made a conscious decision to abandon his child. As for me, the only single memory I have of papa Dan was when I was 3. We were sleeping over at his house, and I asked my mom for a nightlight. She said she‚Äôd go look for one and in the meantime leave the door cracked with the hall light on. Moments later papa Dan comes in and says verbatim ‚Äúyou‚Äôre scared of the dark? What are you a pussy, some kind of girl?‚Äù then laughs as he shuts the door and turns off the hall light so it doesn‚Äôt even shine underneath.

A few months after bio dad came back into my life, was when I really started accepting myself. I came out in April of 2022 but didn‚Äôt really ‚Äúdo anything about it‚Äù for awhile. Then in October of that same year I got in a car accident that by all means should‚Äôve killed me but I literally walked away from. That was when I realized, I could‚Äôve been dead, mourned, buried and remembered as a person I never was. A person who never existed. A person who at least to me, wasn‚Äôt real and was literally just a mask. I knew then that come hell or high water and whatever it costs me, I HAVE to live my authenticity. And that is exactly what I did.

I made a post coming out on Facebook, ironically it was on Halloween but I didn‚Äôt realize it until after I made the post, and everyone was mostly supportive. I deleted all my pictures and started posting new ones. After a few months I realize I haven‚Äôt heard from bio dad in awhile so I go to his page. And where it should have said ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with a check mark, it was just a big blue button that said ‚Äúadd friend‚Äù. Which means that after his whole speech and apologies, and still remembering what he did to me the first time, he did it to me AGAIN, just because he didn‚Äôt even want to bother to have a conversation or try to understand. He never mentioned a thing, just quietly unfriended me without so much as a word.

I started my social transition that very October, and HRT in January of the following year and never looked back. I‚Äôm now living full time as Victoria at work and social events and everywhere whether they‚Äôre trans events or not. I‚Äôm living full time as a woman and have been for close to 2 years now. I pass pretty well most of the time and couldn‚Äôt even tell you when was the last time I got misgendered, if you don‚Äôt count jackasses online who want to try to ‚Äúown me‚Äù after I tell them I‚Äôm trans because it‚Äôs relevant. If it‚Äôs not relevant I hardly ever mention it.

I‚Äôm always open about the fact I‚Äôm trans with potential dating or romantic partners, because I think that‚Äôs just safer and also honest. All my dating profiles are filled with not only the fact that I‚Äôm trans but details about it, including surgical aspirations etc. because if something like this is a deal breaker I‚Äôd rather know up front and I‚Äôd also rather not set myself up for a violent reaction from a pissed off guy later because he felt ‚Äútricked‚Äù. This approach has not had any issues to this point.

My first few months of transition, and a full calendar year after I came out I didn‚Äôt set foot in a church at all. I was convinced God hated me, that I was broken, etc. it wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt think he was there, I knew he was, and that‚Äôs what hurt. But then I found the Episcopal Church, literally on Easter Sunday. And it is here that I enter into my next chapter. We will call this next guy Jason.

Jason was much older than me, and came into my church in November of 2023. I know how it feels to not know if you‚Äôre welcome so I wanted to make him feel he is. I know how important it is and that‚Äôs all I was trying to do. Later that day I get a friend request and message on fb from Jason. Telling me I‚Äôm really pretty and he wanted to ask me out but was nervous. I didn‚Äôt really want to but I also felt bad if I didn‚Äôt give him a chance, because I‚Äôve been rejected and abandoned so many times. So I agreed.

At the time my brother was using my car, so Jason offered to bring me to work and pick me up. He lived an hour away and I had to be to work at 6am so I felt bad. After a couple weeks I started saying hey, if it‚Äôll be easier why not just stay over on days I work, so you‚Äôre not driving back and forth so much. You can go home on my weekends. And he agreed to that. By this time I was starting to kind of let my shields down and like him, but we weren‚Äôt official yet. Eventually that turned into hey, why don‚Äôt you just not leave, and we wound up living together still with not being official.

I told Jason countless times that I wanted a traditional courting phase but our circumstances seemed to be preventing that. He was helping me a lot getting me to work and back and I felt bad for him driving so much, so I sacrificed what I really wanted to make it easier on him, even though he didn‚Äôt ask. After that, everything changed. I formally agreed to be his girlfriend in January of 2024, and that‚Äôs one of the worst decisions I‚Äôve ever made.

Once we were officially together, it was like he was a different guy. I couldn‚Äôt do anything right, he yelled at me all the time and had blowups even though I begged him to control himself because that doesn‚Äôt do anything but make me freeze up, because I flash back to my childhood. He would of course always apologize but it never lasted. He had prosthetic legs which I already knew when we got together, because of a car accident. Because of that he couldn‚Äôt walk fast or even at what is a normal pace for most people. I could‚Äôve taken greater care, but when we were together in public I‚Äôd accidentally leave him in the dust sometimes. But I always felt bad about it and ran back to where he was and tried to watch my stride, and I really was working on it. Anyway, that became that supposedly I just was embarrassed to be seen with a guy with prosthetic legs so was trying to get away from him whenever we were in public. Which of course is complete fiction.

That relationship lasted 7 months which was 7 months too long. Even after we broke up, I offered to let him stay because I knew he didn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go except live in his car, or money since he was on a fixed disability income. He said no because it would be hard, which I understand that. But then he kept gaslighting me about it and made me feel guilty. He kept telling all our mutual friends at the church that I kicked him out. He threatened every other day to leave, so that particular night I was tired of it and just said cool, why don‚Äôt you then? That‚Äôs not me kicking you out it‚Äôs me not stopping you. I called your bluff and you don‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs all it is. But he goes telling all our friends that I kicked him out knowing he‚Äôd be homeless and I‚Äôm just this heartless bitch of a woman. Most of them quietly unfriended me on fb without a word just like bio dad, and I had to stop going to that church. I was in many ways right back where I started.

The rest of my life in Texas doesn‚Äôt matter. Politics got bad, my mental health was worse, and try as I might I just couldn‚Äôt make myself be ok and feel safe. After one particularly bad mental health crisis in which I developed a solid plan to kms for the first time in over a decade (as in not just passing thoughts), and which resulted in my then current job sending police to my house to do a welfare check and deadname and misgender me in the process, I scared myself so bad, I didn‚Äôt want to go back to that place, and I knew I needed to get out of Texas. Thankfully, the night before in response to a post I made about the situation and asking for prayers and encouragement, a woman I didn‚Äôt know reached out to me and offered me a space in her home, no money, no strings. Just a safe place to start over. I jumped on it.

Now we‚Äôre back in present day. I‚Äôve had my first date with John which was just talking and coffee. At the end of it he kissed me. It was awkward because I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. I‚Äôd never had a real and proper first date with a guy, and prior to that my only experience having an actual relationship with a man post transition was with Jason, which couldn‚Äôt possibly have been a worst first impression. I hadn‚Äôt been with anyone or kissed anyone since Jason and I broke up almost a year prior. So it was awkward.

John could tell, and texted me later that night to apologize. I told him no, the kiss was good and the date was fun, I just wasn‚Äôt expecting it and I don‚Äôt know how normal a kiss after a first date is, but that I liked it. After that we went out again, this time to see the new Lilo and Stitch live action. He opens up to me about his past and says he has a history of rushing into things too fast with a woman. He said he regretted his kiss and just wants to hang out without trying to make it be anything. I told him I understood. But when I‚Äôm with this guy‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs real. There‚Äôs definitely a spark there at least on my side.

I‚Äôd never want to pressure him into anything or make him feel bad and I told him that. At this point we‚Äôre still hanging out as friends. We‚Äôve been out together several times, and he‚Äôs still a gentleman even though we aren‚Äôt together. He recently told me he doesn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs ready for a relationship at all, and he doesn‚Äôt want to mislead me because he knows I like him because I told him. I know this isn‚Äôt some kind of manipulation because in a moment of weakness I actually offered him to mess around and he said he doesn‚Äôt want to, because he likes me as a friend right now. And he said even if he could handle just having casual sex with me, he knows I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it without getting more attached emotionally, and he was right.  And I knew it because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always been. I‚Äôve even had ex girlfriends make fun of me telling me I‚Äôm ‚Äúlike a girl‚Äù when it comes to sex.

We went to a Rapids (soccer game) a couple weeks ago and afterwards just stood in the parking lot for over an hour talking. There were tears. There was honesty. There were hugs. There was a kiss I wanted so badly at the end that never happened. I told him I appreciate him being so honest and forthcoming, and not just using me as a time killer without caring what it‚Äôs doing to my feelings. He made it clear I can walk away from our friendship at any time, and also that he doesn‚Äôt want me to wait for him, because it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to me and he would feel bad even though I‚Äôd tell him not to.

Now we‚Äôre at tonight. We‚Äôre at the Rockies game and it starts raining. There‚Äôs chaos and pandemonium as everyone tries to get under a covering or awning. It‚Äôs really coming down and the crowd is tightly packed and barely moving. We finally make it to a covering but it‚Äôs already jam packed full, so I‚Äôm actually standing halfway in the rain still. He notices, and uses his arm to gently move me under the awning while telling me ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you come under here and I‚Äôll stand there‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt expecting rain so I was just in a tanktop. Even under normal circumstances I get cold easy but it was a hot day. The rain and wind turned on those symptoms fast.

After some minutes I decide I just can‚Äôt stand there, and we need to walk around the ballpark and look for a shop where I can buy a jacket or sweater of some kind. (We did eventually find one, but that isn‚Äôt the point of the story). Everyone is walking a hundred different directions packed close together. I don‚Äôt want to lose him so I instinctively grab his arm as he‚Äôs in front of me, hooking my elbow under his. I quickly realize what I did and apologize and ask if it‚Äôs ok, he says yes.

In that moment it hits me. This is everything I ever wanted. I feel safe with this guy even as chaos happens around. I‚Äôm holding onto him and he is holding onto me. I‚Äôm just in a normal woman man relationship with this guy, except I‚Äôm not. I quickly realize that I‚Äôm fantasizing, but I can‚Äôt stop. John really is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted in a man, but he doesn‚Äôt feel the same way, not because of me, but because he doesn‚Äôt want anyone right now, regardless.

I confess all this to him later as we‚Äôre walking back to the car after we escape the chaos inside the ballpark. He tells me he‚Äôs sorry, and he wishes there was something he could do. He offered to stop hanging out with me or talking to me if it will help, I told him not to do that. When he brought me back I asked him if he would like to come inside and meet my roommates, the couple who gave me a way out of Texas. And by now they‚Äôre much more to me than that. They are becoming a mother and father figure to me. I still have a good relationship with my real mom and stepdad, who I consider to be my dad and call him such. I call him stepdad here for the sake of context and to not induce confusion.

It was also my birthday, the game was my present.

Anyway, he agreed to come in. He introduced himself to them, and he shook my roommate that I will call James (the boyfriend of the woman who actually reached out to me in the first place when I was still in Texas), and they were talking. About me and about other things. I told them about what John did at the game, bringing me in from the rain and taking my place. James comments to him good job, that‚Äôs how it should be and kind of smiled. John agreed and said he‚Äôd never not handle that situation that way.

So now I‚Äôm home, I have to be up for work in an hour and a half for a 12 hour shift and I can‚Äôt sleep, because I‚Äôm grieving the breakup of a relationship that never existed in the first place. We‚Äôre friends and I know that. I‚Äôve always known that ever since we had that conversation. But I‚Äôve been seeing for weeks now and especially tonight, everything I want out of a relationship with a man. I actually told myself this must be how other girls dating good guys feel. Except they actually have the good guy and I don‚Äôt.

Part of me feels bad. Part of me feels greedy. God has already done so much for me in just these last couple years, and here I am saying ‚Äúby the way could you throw a man in there too while you‚Äôre at it?‚Äù It feels ungrateful, but I can‚Äôt help it. I want someone to share my life with, a companion, and John is perfect for it, except he isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know as things currently stand John isn‚Äôt an option and I would never even dream of trying to manipulate him or make him feel guilty or pressure him into a relationship he doesn‚Äôt want. I just‚Ä¶. I want love in my life. True romantic love. I want to feel how other women in good and healthy relationships feel. 

Ps: I will ask any of you who feel some urge to tell me the reason God isn‚Äôt helping me is because I‚Äôm living a sinful lifestyle. It‚Äôs not anywhere in the Bible and I feel closer to God now than I ever did pre transition. Because I‚Äôm who he actually created me to be, I‚Äôm coming to him as I am authentically, and I can finally allow myself to feel the full depths of his love and embrace. Also, I‚Äôve felt this way since I was 6 and was raised by very conservative fundamentalist Christian parents. I didn‚Äôt even hear the word trans until I was like 28. That didn‚Äôt stop me from knowing deep down that I should‚Äôve been born a girl since I was 6, or wanting to be Wonder Woman for Halloween when I was 8. And also because this isn‚Äôt a debate post about gender identity or if trans people should be able to exist or not. I will respectfully ask you to refrain from such comments here. If you don‚Äôt agree, or are just going to try to cut me down, please just don‚Äôt say anything. Not because I can‚Äôt handle myself in debate, but this post isn‚Äôt the time or place for it.

TLDR: I was abused as a kid by my stepdad and abandoned by my bio dad and step brother and sister. I transitioned late in life at 32 (I‚Äôm now 35) and so have only had a seriously relationship with one guy which was toxic and abusive from his end and basically the whole thing was just really really bad. I have a new guy who I‚Äôm friends with and he‚Äôs everything I want, but he‚Äôs not looking to change his single status anytime soon. He‚Äôs a gentleman, treats me right and even does those chivalry things which I adore. I feel selfish asking for God to throw a boyfriend in on top of everything else he‚Äôs already done for me over the last few years especially, as if it‚Äôs not enough and I need more. As if I‚Äôm not grateful.

French Press is my go-to brew method, and over time I found myself wishing for a cleaner way to handle ratios and timing without jumping between calculators, timers, or messy notes.

So I ended up building a small iOS app for myself ‚Äî it‚Äôs called Simple Cup. It helps you quickly calculate your coffee-to-water ratio, guides you through the brew with a built-in timer, and lets you save notes and recipes.

I'm preparing an update that improves the UI, and before I go much further with it, I wanted to get some thoughts from others who actually use French Press daily. I‚Äôm especially curious about:
	‚Ä¢	Whether you‚Äôd find a ratio + timer combo useful in practice
	‚Ä¢	Any specific features or annoyances you‚Äôd want solved in a coffee app
	‚Ä¢	How you handle your own brew timing or notes (pen & paper, mental math, other apps?)

If anyone‚Äôs open to testing it and giving honest feedback, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Happy to share the App Store link if that‚Äôs allowed here, or I can DM it.

Not trying to pitch anything ‚Äî just trying to make something genuinely helpful. Thanks again. 

Best,
Baise

There isn‚Äôt any way that I could say everything I need to in a few short paragraphs, and it wouldn‚Äôt do it justice even if I could. There will be a severely stripped down TLDR at the end but I‚Äôd really appreciate everyone who reads everything to get full context.

I‚Äôm a trans woman (35 as of literally yesterday!) and a couple months ago I moved to Colorado from Texas. Right before I moved here I changed my location on my dating apps to here. I met a guy. It isn‚Äôt his name but we will call him John.

John and I chatted on the app for a couple weeks, before he ultimately asked me out on a date to meet in person. I am very old fashioned with things like this and really like it if the guy is the one to do these things. (I am going to pause here to say that everyone‚Äôs preferences are entirely valid. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúright way‚Äù to do these things, but this is how I personally like it).

Before I continue in the story of John, I will tell you a bit about my history, including my narcissistic, gaslighting, verbally and mentally abusive ex boyfriend:

When I was 4, my bio dad left me on my mother‚Äôs doorstep. He did this because the woman he was seeing at the time didn‚Äôt want kids, anything to do with kids, or kids around at all. So she basically made him choose between her or me. He picked her. And he explained that all to me that morning on my mom‚Äôs porch, as if I would ‚Äúget it‚Äù. He made sure to tell me that when I turn 18 if I want to see him I could buy a plane ticket. He‚Äôs actually married to that woman now, so I guess at least it wasn‚Äôt for nothing. I‚Äôd have felt pretty stupid if they didn‚Äôt make it given what (who) he gave up in order to keep her.

What followed after that was 13 years of extreme physical abuse and mental and emotional torture. I do not use that word lightly or gloss over the depths of what it means. I mean it in every possible sense. I was also made fun of at school and even church. I had ZERO reprieve. My childhood was basically 24/7 HELL, another word I don‚Äôt use lightly. I had no escape and I had no safe space. And I also developed a whole lot of religious trauma because of how the church itself and people in it treated me, all because I was sensitive and ‚Äúboys‚Äù aren‚Äôt supposed to be. Well jokes on them, I found out much later that I never actually was one.

Because of all these factors I developed a lot of co dependent tendencies, and have been in and out of therapy to try and deal with some of them. Remember my bio dad who abandoned me? Well to add onto that I was abandoned by 2 other people I loved, much later in life. My step brother and sister from abusive step dads first marriage who he some kind of way managed to achieve full custody of. After his marriage to my mom ended, he‚Äôd spent time brainwashing them that everything bad that happened was actually because of my mom and our side of the family. I haven‚Äôt heard or seen from either one of them since except once, which was in 2009 in February. My sister is not on any socials, the brother is but never responded to the friend request and message and I sent him years ago. He was a marine then and last I knew he still is.

I made my first attempt on my own life when I was 11, because a girl didn‚Äôt like me back. I just needed someone, ANYONE to like me. I was still severely in denial then, come to find out I don‚Äôt even like women that way. Anyway, what followed was a series of toxic, codependent relationships that never worked out and left a lot of hurt and pain in their wake. They weren‚Äôt all for nothing though, to this day I‚Äôm still friends with my ex fianc√©e who accepts me, and my ex girlfriend of 4 years (the last girl I dated before I did a lot of serious soul searching and started realizing and more importantly ACCEPTING everything) is literally my biggest supporter and cheerleader now. She lives in LA so we haven‚Äôt seen each other in years but we speak semi often and stay in touch.

After that last relationship, when I was still in denial about myself my bio dad reached out on Facebook. The year is now 2022. He tells me his dad (my grandpa on his side who I knew as papa Dan and hadn‚Äôt talked to in decades) had just died. So he was starting to understand what he did to me when he left. And he acknowledged it‚Äôs worse, because his dad just passed away, whereas HE made a conscious decision to abandon his child. As for me, the only single memory I have of papa Dan was when I was 3. We were sleeping over at his house, and I asked my mom for a nightlight. She said she‚Äôd go look for one and in the meantime leave the door cracked with the hall light on. Moments later papa Dan comes in and says verbatim ‚Äúyou‚Äôre scared of the dark? What are you a pussy, some kind of girl?‚Äù then laughs as he shuts the door and turns off the hall light so it doesn‚Äôt even shine underneath.

A few months after bio dad came back into my life, was when I really started accepting myself. I came out in April of 2022 but didn‚Äôt really ‚Äúdo anything about it‚Äù for awhile. Then in October of that same year I got in a car accident that by all means should‚Äôve killed me but I literally walked away from. That was when I realized, I could‚Äôve been dead, mourned, buried and remembered as a person I never was. A person who never existed. A person who at least to me, wasn‚Äôt real and was literally just a mask. I knew then that come hell or high water and whatever it costs me, I HAVE to live my authenticity. And that is exactly what I did.

I made a post coming out on Facebook, ironically it was on Halloween but I didn‚Äôt realize it until after I made the post, and everyone was mostly supportive. I deleted all my pictures and started posting new ones. After a few months I realize I haven‚Äôt heard from bio dad in awhile so I go to his page. And where it should have said ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with a check mark, it was just a big blue button that said ‚Äúadd friend‚Äù. Which means that after his whole speech and apologies, and still remembering what he did to me the first time, he did it to me AGAIN, just because he didn‚Äôt even want to bother to have a conversation or try to understand. He never mentioned a thing, just quietly unfriended me without so much as a word.

I started my social transition that very October, and HRT in January of the following year and never looked back. I‚Äôm now living full time as Victoria at work and social events and everywhere whether they‚Äôre trans events or not. I‚Äôm living full time as a woman and have been for close to 2 years now. I pass pretty well most of the time and couldn‚Äôt even tell you when was the last time I got misgendered, if you don‚Äôt count jackasses online who want to try to ‚Äúown me‚Äù after I tell them I‚Äôm trans because it‚Äôs relevant. If it‚Äôs not relevant I hardly ever mention it.

I‚Äôm always open about the fact I‚Äôm trans with potential dating or romantic partners, because I think that‚Äôs just safer and also honest. All my dating profiles are filled with not only the fact that I‚Äôm trans but details about it, including surgical aspirations etc. because if something like this is a deal breaker I‚Äôd rather know up front and I‚Äôd also rather not set myself up for a violent reaction from a pissed off guy later because he felt ‚Äútricked‚Äù. This approach has not had any issues to this point.

My first few months of transition, and a full calendar year after I came out I didn‚Äôt set foot in a church at all. I was convinced God hated me, that I was broken, etc. it wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt think he was there, I knew he was, and that‚Äôs what hurt. But then I found the Episcopal Church, literally on Easter Sunday. And it is here that I enter into my next chapter. We will call this next guy Jason.

Jason was much older than me, and came into my church in November of 2023. I know how it feels to not know if you‚Äôre welcome so I wanted to make him feel he is. I know how important it is and that‚Äôs all I was trying to do. Later that day I get a friend request and message on fb from Jason. Telling me I‚Äôm really pretty and he wanted to ask me out but was nervous. I didn‚Äôt really want to but I also felt bad if I didn‚Äôt give him a chance, because I‚Äôve been rejected and abandoned so many times. So I agreed.

At the time my brother was using my car, so Jason offered to bring me to work and pick me up. He lived an hour away and I had to be to work at 6am so I felt bad. After a couple weeks I started saying hey, if it‚Äôll be easier why not just stay over on days I work, so you‚Äôre not driving back and forth so much. You can go home on my weekends. And he agreed to that. By this time I was starting to kind of let my shields down and like him, but we weren‚Äôt official yet. Eventually that turned into hey, why don‚Äôt you just not leave, and we wound up living together still with not being official.

I told Jason countless times that I wanted a traditional courting phase but our circumstances seemed to be preventing that. He was helping me a lot getting me to work and back and I felt bad for him driving so much, so I sacrificed what I really wanted to make it easier on him, even though he didn‚Äôt ask. After that, everything changed. I formally agreed to be his girlfriend in January of 2024, and that‚Äôs one of the worst decisions I‚Äôve ever made.

Once we were officially together, it was like he was a different guy. I couldn‚Äôt do anything right, he yelled at me all the time and had blowups even though I begged him to control himself because that doesn‚Äôt do anything but make me freeze up, because I flash back to my childhood. He would of course always apologize but it never lasted. He had prosthetic legs which I already knew when we got together, because of a car accident. Because of that he couldn‚Äôt walk fast or even at what is a normal pace for most people. I could‚Äôve taken greater care, but when we were together in public I‚Äôd accidentally leave him in the dust sometimes. But I always felt bad about it and ran back to where he was and tried to watch my stride, and I really was working on it. Anyway, that became that supposedly I just was embarrassed to be seen with a guy with prosthetic legs so was trying to get away from him whenever we were in public. Which of course is complete fiction.

That relationship lasted 7 months which was 7 months too long. Even after we broke up, I offered to let him stay because I knew he didn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go except live in his car, or money since he was on a fixed disability income. He said no because it would be hard, which I understand that. But then he kept gaslighting me about it and made me feel guilty. He kept telling all our mutual friends at the church that I kicked him out. He threatened every other day to leave, so that particular night I was tired of it and just said cool, why don‚Äôt you then? That‚Äôs not me kicking you out it‚Äôs me not stopping you. I called your bluff and you don‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs all it is. But he goes telling all our friends that I kicked him out knowing he‚Äôd be homeless and I‚Äôm just this heartless bitch of a woman. Most of them quietly unfriended me on fb without a word just like bio dad, and I had to stop going to that church. I was in many ways right back where I started.

The rest of my life in Texas doesn‚Äôt matter. Politics got bad, my mental health was worse, and try as I might I just couldn‚Äôt make myself be ok and feel safe. After one particularly bad mental health crisis in which I developed a solid plan to kms for the first time in over a decade (as in not just passing thoughts), and which resulted in my then current job sending police to my house to do a welfare check and deadname and misgender me in the process, I scared myself so bad, I didn‚Äôt want to go back to that place, and I knew I needed to get out of Texas. Thankfully, the night before in response to a post I made about the situation and asking for prayers and encouragement, a woman I didn‚Äôt know reached out to me and offered me a space in her home, no money, no strings. Just a safe place to start over. I jumped on it.

Now we‚Äôre back in present day. I‚Äôve had my first date with John which was just talking and coffee. At the end of it he kissed me. It was awkward because I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. I‚Äôd never had a real and proper first date with a guy, and prior to that my only experience having an actual relationship with a man post transition was with Jason, which couldn‚Äôt possibly have been a worst first impression. I hadn‚Äôt been with anyone or kissed anyone since Jason and I broke up almost a year prior. So it was awkward.

John could tell, and texted me later that night to apologize. I told him no, the kiss was good and the date was fun, I just wasn‚Äôt expecting it and I don‚Äôt know how normal a kiss after a first date is, but that I liked it. After that we went out again, this time to see the new Lilo and Stitch live action. He opens up to me about his past and says he has a history of rushing into things too fast with a woman. He said he regretted his kiss and just wants to hang out without trying to make it be anything. I told him I understood. But when I‚Äôm with this guy‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs real. There‚Äôs definitely a spark there at least on my side.

I‚Äôd never want to pressure him into anything or make him feel bad and I told him that. At this point we‚Äôre still hanging out as friends. We‚Äôve been out together several times, and he‚Äôs still a gentleman even though we aren‚Äôt together. He recently told me he doesn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs ready for a relationship at all, and he doesn‚Äôt want to mislead me because he knows I like him because I told him. I know this isn‚Äôt some kind of manipulation because in a moment of weakness I actually offered him to mess around and he said he doesn‚Äôt want to, because he likes me as a friend right now. And he said even if he could handle just having casual sex with me, he knows I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it without getting more attached emotionally, and he was right.  And I knew it because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always been. I‚Äôve even had ex girlfriends make fun of me telling me I‚Äôm ‚Äúlike a girl‚Äù when it comes to sex.

We went to a Rapids (soccer game) a couple weeks ago and afterwards just stood in the parking lot for over an hour talking. There were tears. There was honesty. There were hugs.

He made it clear I can walk away from our friendship at any time, and also that he doesn‚Äôt want me to wait for him, because it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to me and he would feel bad even though I‚Äôd tell him not to.

Now we‚Äôre at tonight. We‚Äôre at the Rockies game and it starts raining. There‚Äôs chaos and pandemonium as everyone tries to get under a covering or awning. It‚Äôs really coming down and the crowd is tightly packed and barely moving. We finally make it to a covering but it‚Äôs already jam packed full, so I‚Äôm actually standing halfway in the rain still. He notices, and uses his arm to gently move me under the awning while telling me ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you come under here and I‚Äôll stand there‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt expecting rain so I was just in a tanktop. Even under normal circumstances I get cold easy but it was a hot day. The rain and wind turned on those symptoms fast.

After some minutes I decide I just can‚Äôt stand there, and we need to walk around the ballpark and look for a shop where I can buy a jacket or sweater of some kind. (We did eventually find one, but that isn‚Äôt the point of the story). Everyone is walking a hundred different directions packed close together. I don‚Äôt want to lose him so I instinctively grab his arm as he‚Äôs in front of me, hooking my elbow under his. I quickly realize what I did and apologize and ask if it‚Äôs ok, he says yes.

In that moment it hits me. This is everything I ever wanted. I feel safe with this guy even as chaos happens around. I‚Äôm holding onto him and he is holding onto me. I‚Äôm just in a normal woman man relationship with this guy, except I‚Äôm not. I quickly realize that I‚Äôm fantasizing, but I can‚Äôt stop. John really is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted in a man, but he doesn‚Äôt feel the same way, not because of me, but because he doesn‚Äôt want anyone right now, regardless.

I confess all this to him later as we‚Äôre walking back to the car after we escape the chaos inside the ballpark. He tells me he‚Äôs sorry, and he wishes there was something he could do. He offered to stop hanging out with me or talking to me if it will help, I told him not to do that. When he brought me back I asked him if he would like to come inside and meet my roommates, the couple who gave me a way out of Texas. And by now they‚Äôre much more to me than that. They are becoming a mother and father figure to me. I still have a good relationship with my real mom and stepdad, who I consider to be my dad and call him such. I call him stepdad here for the sake of context and to not induce confusion.

It was also my birthday, the game was my present.

Anyway, he agreed to come in. He introduced himself to them, and he shook my roommate that I will call James (the boyfriend of the woman who actually reached out to me in the first place when I was still in Texas), and they were talking. About me and about other things. I told them about what John did at the game, bringing me in from the rain and taking my place. James comments to him good job, that‚Äôs how it should be and kind of smiled. John agreed and said he‚Äôd never not handle that situation that way.

So now I‚Äôm home, I have to be up for work in an hour and a half for a 12 hour shift and I can‚Äôt sleep, because I‚Äôm grieving the breakup of a relationship that never existed in the first place. We‚Äôre friends and I know that. I‚Äôve always known that ever since we had that conversation. But I‚Äôve been seeing for weeks now and especially tonight, everything I want out of a relationship with a man. I actually told myself this must be how other girls dating good guys feel. Except they actually have the good guy and I don‚Äôt.

Part of me feels bad. Part of me feels greedy. God has already done so much for me in just these last couple years, and here I am saying ‚Äúby the way could you throw a man in there too while you‚Äôre at it?‚Äù It feels ungrateful, but I can‚Äôt help it. I want someone to share my life with, a companion, and John is perfect for it, except he isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know as things currently stand John isn‚Äôt an option and I would never even dream of trying to manipulate him or make him feel guilty or pressure him into a relationship he doesn‚Äôt want. I just‚Ä¶. I want love in my life. True romantic love. I want to feel how other women in good and healthy relationships feel. 

TLDR: I was abused as a kid by my stepdad and abandoned by my bio dad and step brother and sister. I transitioned late in life at 32 (I‚Äôm now 35) and so have only had a seriously relationship with one guy which was toxic and abusive from his end and basically the whole thing was just really really bad. I have a new guy who I‚Äôm friends with and he‚Äôs everything I want, but he‚Äôs not looking to change his single status anytime soon. He‚Äôs a gentleman, treats me right and even does those chivalry things which I adore. I feel selfish asking for God to throw a boyfriend in on top of everything else he‚Äôs already done for me over the last few years especially, as if it‚Äôs not enough and I need more. As if I‚Äôm not grateful.

However after doing so I have a weird problem. My espresso shots are running way too fast. Normally I have 30 second shots, now 10 seconds. I am using same basket, same coffee, same grinder/settings. When I make a shot the pressure only goes up to 4 bar, but when I use the blind portafilter the pressure goes to 9 bar.

I am really at a loss. I checked if maybe the grouphead gasket is leaking but it isn't.

I did flush out all the descaling liquid, the descaler liquid is red, so it is easy to detect if there were some left. I tried to grind much finer but it makes no diference... Is this a massive coincidence and could the problem be my grinder? The grind looks fine to me actually.

Unfortunately, that means I can't just ghost people and call it a day anymore. I'm looking for advice on how to nicely but firmly drop two people I was more-or-less seeing before my girlfriend and I went exclusive.

On each person:

""Jane"" (19F) and I shared a class and worked in the same building with overlapping hours (took the bus together). It started to seem like she had a crush, so when she started talking about never having dated anyone in college before and not knowing how to initiate etc etc I texted after work saying I thought about what she had said and wanted to buy her a coffee. We did that and it was a nice classic first date, but I ended up keeping things more platonic+positive over text without initiating any other activities together in hope things would peter out- she ended up texting a couple weeks ago to ask how summer is going.

The issue for me here is figuring out a firm way to let her know I have a girlfriend now without making her feel personally rejected or like she's involved in the situation, especially because she trusted me with her being new to dating.

""Jeremiah"" (22M) and I met during a Halloween party when I walked him home at 4am (unrelated, but I had a banger slutty angel costume that got me posted about on the campus yikyak twice!!). We randomly started flirty texting on and off after winter break, but struggled to make plans for him to come visit because I work EMS + 3 part time jobs and couldn't get a free weekend on short notice. He ended up coming through to see a dance show I was in and staying for the weekend during Easter, we hung out solo during the day, hit the frats with the larger group at night, and I took him to the friend group Easter brunch. We never got farther than making out in my bed, but we did get super handsy in front of all of my friends (including Mocha) at a few parties, which in retrospect was messy. Also, his friend tried to pull some stupid two-man and ended up trying to have a threesome with this girl I hate and Mocha by telling her ""I'm SO sorry Jeremiah is fucking your boyfriend RIGHT NOW"" after we all went out and I left early with Jeremiah ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (she and I weren't dating at the time, but I guess someone clued him in to our vibe). We texted thru finals but got in contact less and less as Mocha and I got closer, but he texted again earlier this month and I haven't responded yet.

The issue here is that I've randomly ghosted Jeremiah before and he asked me not to do it again (I know, it's bad). I want to make it clear I'm with my girlfriend now without getting to a hurtful extent about me picking her over him because I was in talking stages with both of them at the same time. I also don't know how much he knew about Mocha and me- I tried to be transparent, he met her and saw us dance together at parties, and it seems like his friend knew something, but it was never explicitly stated and I think Jeremiah can be a little clueless sometimes.

I've never really been in a situation like this before, and I can't really talk about this with a lot of my uni friends because I share a friend group with my girlfriend. I also don't want to Mocha to worry, esp because I was transparent about Jeremiah when I was in situationship stages with both of them at once and that caused her some emotional pain. I know I have a reputation, but I am firmly loyal once cuffed and I really don't want any old flings to text me at this point, especially because I know it'll hurt Mocha if someone reaches out, even if I shut them down quickly.

Lowkey irrelevant but last thing to add: It's no excuse, but I find that growing up hearing from family that no one in their right mind would ever find people like me dateable/fuckable has really fucked a lot of my past relationships sideways and made me very reluctant to let go of people's feelings for me, even when it's no longer good for either party. For this reason, I want to apologize in advance if I get defensive over any advice- maybe you'll see where I'm coming from with this context.

To recap, I'm looking for what to say to cut these two people loose respectfully but firmly and without being so nice that it's not considerate of my girlfriend. Both of them have texted me in the last month, so I don't think I can let things just peter out. I'm also new to making posts, so please let me know if edits are needed- if you can find it in you to assume I'm trying my best and I'm here to get advice, I'd really appreciate it.",0,1750926223.0,relationship_advice,4,0.5,False

I used to make a solid side income from stock photography, but like many others, that‚Äôs dried up in recent years. Oversaturation has really killed it for me.

I‚Äôm now thinking of switching to print-on-demand, focusing on T-shirts, and selling through platforms like Amazon and Etsy.

I‚Äôve done some niche research and I‚Äôm not planning to make generic ‚ÄúI love coffee‚Äù shirts. I‚Äôm targeting specific markets that don‚Äôt have much decent content and have a few design ideas.

My question is: do I realistically have a chance at making decent money with this over time? Or is it also very oversaturated to start up in 2025? 

I was thinking of starting with Inkthreadable so I don‚Äôt need to hold any stock. I‚Äôd just order samples to take proper product shots.

That said, I‚Äôm also wondering if T-shirts are even the best product to focus on. Would I be better off making stickers, cards, or other items with less competition and quicker production?

If anyone is doing POD in 2024 or 2025, I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing how it‚Äôs going and whether you think it‚Äôs still a viable space if you‚Äôre bringing original, high-quality work.

Thanks in advance!

Today, once again‚Ä¶ I woke past the planned time‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI was out of bed around 7:30, but I wanted to be out by 6:00, I‚Äôm an overreaching overacheiver. I stretched a bit, then had a to cup of coffee where the I had two filters break on me as I poured the water. It took me a while to get ready today. My noisy roommate was already up making phone calls‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe flatmates told me that he makes money in sketchy ways and he often cons people to make a buck. He‚Äôs an event organiser or something like that, back in Azerbaijan.

Not much happened today, but I was more groggy than usual. I didn‚Äôt really want to socialse with anyone, and I tried to avoid people, as well as my flatmates.

Evening came as it usually does, it was around eight now, it was getting cooler and darker, so I put on my Ubereats bag, and went out to do some deliveries. Krakow seemed a lot more empty today, the roads were vacant, the historic center seemed less crowded than usual. The first two orders were from a Kebab shop called Arabia Kebab. There was a short line inside as I entered. One of the girls working there was handing out free tea so I took one. It was a sweet black tea, with hints of cinnamon, it was a good boost for the night. She came around again a few minutes after, so I took another cup.

The night didn‚Äôt go too well. The orders were sparse, and the distances were short.

My fourth order was a pizza place called Pizzatopia, in the center of the Jewish district. As I came around I was told it was going to be a twenty minute wait. ‚Äúa twenty minutes wait? For the Bolt order?‚Äù I said suprised. ‚ÄúYes we have to prepare a big order for the Pifbull concert, unfortunetly‚Äù, ‚Äúoh okay, no problem‚Ä¶ maybe I can help a bit?‚Äù I said with a smirk‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe pizza girl laughed ‚ÄúI know how to make a good pizza, a bit of dough, some sauce and a sprinkle of cheese‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshe enjoyed the bit of banter.

The shop was filled with dozen delivery guys, one was a Filipino, one Indian, one Polish, one Middle eastern, most of them were just glued to their phones, it was a sad sight. What a weird society we live in, where people‚Äôs best friend is their smartphone. Like how can you guys just sit there glued to your devices, when you could have a nice interaction with someone, I just don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶

The last order of the night was again a Keban from Arabia Kebab. One day I will try one of their Kebabs, because they look ‚Äòreally‚Äô appetizing. A new guy was working behind the bar, he was a bit nervous, maybe frustrated because another employee was on his ass about what to put and how much to put on each Kebab.

1lkun7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lkun7g/i_work_on_a_space_station_and_something_is_wrong/,I work on a space station and something is wrong with the crew (Part 1),"I work on the newest space station, called ""Laika,"" after the Soviet dog that died on a rocket. At first, I liked the name and the idea of immortalizing the poor animal, but now I think it's kind of prophetic. 

The mission started two months ago, and at first, everything seemed normal. We are a team of experienced astronauts from different nations ‚Äî ten men and five women. Our station is bigger and higher up than the ISS, so it can hold more people. We are supposed to stay on the station for five years ‚Äî longer than anyone ever has. NASA, working with a few other countries, wants to see how well human bodies can adapt to space conditions for long periods of time. One day, our research might help with missions to other planets or perhaps even colonization. This is the official purpose of our mission. There‚Äôs another task we were given, which is a bit more secretive. The station is equipped with newer, stronger technology that can send and receive signals from space. They still hope to hear from faraway civilizations. 

We all got to know each other before the mission and spent months training together. All of us had been on the ISS before, so the adaptation process seemed simple. There was a lot of work, like maintenance and daily reports back to Earth, but overall, our life was simple, almost peaceful. 

Everything changed on a random Friday of the third week. I was working with the ‚ÄúLong-Distance Communication Array,‚Äù which we jokingly called ‚ÄúRay.‚Äù I was in the room with Greg Swanson, a 45-year-old American engineer who was the most skeptical about the existence of extraterrestrial life. He had spent his entire life working for NASA and believed that if aliens did, in fact, exist, we would have already known about them. But he was the best in his field, and the pay was good, so he agreed to go on the mission. All the money was being sent to his wife and four children. Usually we ran all the waves we received through sonification process. We were listening to the usual silence through ‚ÄúRay‚Äù until‚Ä¶ 

BOOM 

The sound was so loud I had to cover my ears. I felt like the echoes were bouncing inside my brain, causing a strong headache. Greg and I stared at each other in disbelief for a few seconds, then went back to ‚ÄúRay.‚Äù Humans had received what they thought were signals from outer space civilisations before, but soon we learned that those were stars exploding or black holes expanding. This sound was something entirely different. It wasn‚Äôt like any signal we had received before ‚Äî the system couldn‚Äôt even tell its frequency.

We called our teammates. It didn‚Äôt matter what they were doing ‚Äî they all stopped midway and joined us in the Signal Room. Nothing was more important than this. We saved the recording and sent it back to Earth as soon as we could. Whatever it was, it could be the biggest discovery of our century. We could come back as heroes. But honestly, I couldn‚Äôt care less about that. We might be the first people ever to come in contact with extraterrestrial life. That thought sent shivers down my spine. 

We spent the evening celebrating. There‚Äôs no alcohol on the station, but the excitement everyone shared made me feel drunk. We kept talking and laughing and coming up with potential explanations of what the signal might be. There was a feeling of victory and almost childlike curiosity about the unknown. Now both we and the scientists back on Earth had a tough job of trying to decipher the signal.

Our team had three Signal Processing Specialists ‚Äî 33-year-old Maria Smirnova from Russia, 40-year-old Oliver Allen from the UK, and 25-year-old Mia Gonzales from the US. Mia was the youngest on our team, yet extremely intelligent. All three had experience in analyzing signals from outer space and the deep ocean, yet none of them had any idea what ours meant.

‚ÄúWhen we receive signals from a giant star, for example, we can tell almost everything‚Äù, Maria explained to me as we were having lunch in the cafeteria block. ‚ÄúWe can tell how far away it is, what is happening, and when it happened. This is something completely different. Our computers have no idea. When I'm listening to it, it's like I feel vibrations in my entire body‚Äù.

Two weeks went by, and nothing really happened since. There were no more signals that ‚ÄúRay‚Äù could detect, and the team still had no idea what ours could mean or where it could have come from. We were trying our best, but the excitement was slowly dying down. It still felt normal, but not as peaceful as before. Something was changing on the station, and I could feel it. 

One day, I was working with Chen in the control room. He was a 32-year-old Chinese engineer with a kind smile and a quirky sense of humor. The guy was never serious, and if you met him in a bar, you'd think he was an unemployed party animal still living with his parents, but the man was a genius.

We were doing a routine check of life support systems when suddenly I felt a piercing sharp pain in my forehead. It felt like someone put a giant needle through my brain, and now it was about to explode. Everything inside my head was hot and pulsating. I couldn‚Äôt sit straight and instinctively put my hand to my head. 

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Chen‚Äôs voice sounded like he was talking from a different dimension. Everything went blurry for a second, and then I managed to focus my eyes. 

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ I mean,‚Äù the words wouldn‚Äôt come out of my mouth. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I just had such a strong headache. I think it‚Äôs getting better.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou wanna go to the doctor‚Äôs block?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal out of it.

Chen brought me some water. The headache went away as quickly as it started, so we went back to the life support systems. Chen was my favorite person to work with. He always made me laugh and never acted like the smartest person in the room, even though he probably was one. 

I tried not to think much about the incident, but it still bothered me. I‚Äôve never experienced migraines, but my mom did. I remember her lying down on the couch with her palm to her forehead, and my dad would bring her painkillers. She used to take a lot of them, otherwise, she couldn‚Äôt even focus. Sometimes she would skip work because of migraines, and one day she couldn‚Äôt come to my school play. I was hurt, so dad had to explain to me what a migraine was. As for me, though, I‚Äôve never had them. I was always a healthy and athletic child, which eventually helped me get into a space program. I valued my health, and now this? I began to worry that my mom‚Äôs genetics had kicked in because of my age or long space missions. I really hoped it wasn‚Äôt the case, and well, I soon learned it wasn‚Äôt.

There were two doctors on board, and they were working overtime. Every day, several people would come to complain about headaches. It would be normal if one or two astronauts had this problem, but all of us? A bunch of experienced space travelers? Helen, the doctor from the US, tried her best to help us with pills and breathing exercises, but the results were always temporary. Her Russian colleague, Igor, was freaking out. They couldn‚Äôt figure out what was causing the headaches. The doctors measured our body temperature and blood pressure. We even went through the CT scanners we had on the station. Nothing was out of the ordinary. 

By the next week, it wasn‚Äôt just headaches. I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep no matter how hard I tried. I would lay down in bed with nothing but thoughts that wouldn‚Äôt stop. I wanted to shout at my own brain, ‚ÄúSHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP!‚Äù When I did fall asleep, it was only for a few hours. I would wake up even more tired than before. Everyone was going through it, and we couldn‚Äôt ignore it. It was only our 6th week, and we were not the type of people to crack inside a fully equipped station. None of us had even left ‚ÄúLaika‚Äù once. Something was wrong. We assumed it was the oxygen tanks or the food and water supply. That was our best guess; all the other systems on board were perfectly normal. In space, it‚Äôs usual to have some sort of problem with engines or control blocks, but there weren‚Äôt any. Everything worked like clockwork, yet we all felt miserable. We took turns checking the equipment on a daily basis, ran lab tests on our food supply, but still, there was no answer. The doctors sent our health reports back to Earth for analysis and anxiously waited for a response. We tried our best to stay positive, but it was hard.

One day, I think it was a Thursday, I went to the cafeteria by myself. Everyone else was either working or desperately trying to finally fall asleep. As I got closer to the entrance, I heard voices. It was Greg, the American engineer, and his countrymen Michael and Jessica, both programmers.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre poisoning us, I‚Äôm telling you,‚Äù Michael‚Äôs voice sounded nervous and secretive.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it, Michael. They‚Äôre doctors, why would they do that?‚Äù Jessica sounded nervous too, but more in a confused way.

‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôve worked with you before. I‚Äôve never worked with these people. Helen doesn‚Äôt even seem like a doctor. She told me to meditate. And that Russian guy‚Ä¶ You know he worked for the FSB, right? Before he became an astronaut. I don‚Äôt trust this dude‚Äù.

""How are they doing it?"" Greg sounded as authoritative and skeptical as usual.

""They‚Äôre the only ones running tests in the lab, right?""

""Well, they're the best at chemistry.""

""Which gives them an advantage. How do you know the results they give us aren't tampered with?""

I entered the cafeteria. The heavy metal door slammed shut with a loud noise. All three people turned and stared at me. I‚Äôm not sure how long it lasted, but their gaze made me uncomfortable.

‚ÄúHey, Mira,‚Äù Michael quickly switched from his conspiracy-theorist tone to his usual upbeat voice. ‚ÄúHungry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm starving and could really use some coffee,‚Äù I replied, trying to make my voice sound as casual as I could.

‚ÄúSure, let me make you some.‚Äù

I waited at the table as Michael was making my coffee and opening a package of food. The atmosphere during the meal was extremely awkward, and we all rushed to leave once we were done.

The experience made me question reality. Every astronaut knows: no matter what, you do not bring drama to a space station. You are stuck with just a few people on a piece of metal, hundreds of kilometers away from home. If you start going against each other, you‚Äôre done. Michael‚Äôs accusations were insane. Igor wasn‚Äôt necessarily my friend, but I knew him. He‚Äôs a great doctor, and he‚Äôs from my country. We had been on a mission together once, and he was nothing but helpful. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should tell him what I‚Äôd heard. I didn‚Äôt want to create more tension, but I also didn‚Äôt want Igor to become a scapegoat.

Meanwhile, our symptoms were only getting worse. By week seven, no one could sleep more than an hour a day. Honestly, we felt lucky to even get that one hour. The migraines made everyone grumpy and easily irritated. Some of us began to have regular nosebleeds, and Hiroshi, the Japanese technician, was bleeding from his eyes. We sent an emergency request to get back to Earth for treatment. The reply took an unusually long time to arrive. When it finally came, I almost wished it hadn‚Äôt. The brief message read:

‚ÄúThe risk of mass infection is too high. Return is impossible. Must continue the mission.‚Äù

I‚Äôd wake up at 5, go for a run, enjoy a quiet moment by the beach with a coffee and a blunt, then start my work day relaxed and grateful. I invested in local business, employed Thai workers, contributed to the economy, and encouraged others to come experience what I called ‚Äúparadise.‚Äù

Thailand gave me the best year of my life. But that chapter is now ending.

With the recent decision to reverse cannabis legalization, it‚Äôs become clear that long term stability for investors and residents like myself is no longer guaranteed. I fully respect Thailand‚Äôs right to shape its laws, but the manner in which this policy shift was made sends a concerning message to anyone considering economic involvement here.

Instead of regulation and oversight, the government chose an outright ban, a decision that feels reactive and politically driven, rather than strategic or evidence based. Investors thrive on stability, not unpredictability. Emotionally driven policymaking creates an environment where risk outweighs reward.

Many of us who built lives and businesses here are already looking to relocate to more stable jurisdictions. You can see the shift ticket prices and declining inquiries from potential expat investors.

This isn‚Äôt just about cannabis. It‚Äôs about the signal this sends to the world: that the rules can change overnight, even after significant time, capital, and effort have been committed in good faith.

Thailand will always have a place in my heart. I love this country and its people deeply. But when future economic growth slows, property values drop, or foreign interest wanes, I hope decision makers will remember that it wasn‚Äôt inevitable.
