1npalpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/caloriecount/comments/1npalpr/low_calorie_breakfast_suggestions/,Low Calorie Breakfast Suggestions,"Hey guys.

So long story short, I just changed careers from retail to an office job, and with that transition, I've gone from a little underweight to finally getting within a healthy weight range. However, I've gained quite a bit of weight in the roughly two months I've been at my new job, so I want to start being more conscientious of what I'm eating. I need to cut back on calories to make up for the fact that I'm not constantly running around for my job anymore. 

I'm hoping to get some suggestions on what I can bring for breakfast, as that's probably my biggest opportunity of decreasing calories for the moment. 

What I'm currently eating:
A muffin from Kroger/Meijer/etc bakery (~450 calories)
A GoGo Squeeze applesauce (70 calories)
A Nature Valley granola bar (160 calories) 
(680kcal total)

Why I like it:
--I don't have to cook anything in the morning; I can just grab and go
--I can easily eat these on the road to work
--They are pretty filling, and also heavy enough that if I want to get a cup of coffee in the morning, I don't really have to worry about getting jittery (I, unfortunately, have low caffeine tolerance)
--I am a bit of a picky eater and these are all what I consider safe foods. 

My calorie limit should be around 1800 calories for each day. I think the muffins are really what's getting me, but I'm having trouble finding an alternative that fits my needs. I don't mind making things ahead of time, especially if I can prep something for the whole week at once. I'm just honestly not sure where to start looking, because trying to search ""filling, low calorie meals"" just gives way too many options that don't quite fit what I'm looking for. 

So if you guys have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them! Thanks!",1,1758716365.0,caloriecount,0,1.0,False

Scaling a business can feel like climbing a steep mountain. Time constraints, rising costs, and customer demands make growth challenging. By 2025, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** has become a practical tool for businesses of all sizes, helping them grow smarter, faster, and more efficiently. In this blog, we’ll explore how AI solutions can help you scale seamlessly, with real-world examples and actionable tips.

# Why AI Matters for Business Growth

AI isn’t just for tech giants. Small and medium businesses can benefit too. AI tools save time, [reduce costs,](https://hiphype.io/) and improve customer experiences. Businesses using AI are often able to grow faster and keep customers happier. Here’s how AI can make scaling easier.

# 1. Automate Routine Tasks to Save Time

Repetitive tasks like data entry, scheduling, or answering common customer questions can consume hours daily. AI workflow automation handles these tasks efficiently, freeing your team to focus on growth.

**Example:** A small e-commerce store uses an AI chatbot to answer questions like “Where’s my order?” or “What’s your return policy?” The chatbot resolves hundreds of inquiries every day, saving the customer service team several hours weekly.

**AI Tools:** AI chatbots, automated email responders, or task management software like **Zapier** or **HubSpot**.

**Benefit:** Employees can focus on creative tasks like marketing or product development, driving business scalability.

# 2. Personalize Customer Experiences

Customers love feeling understood. AI analyzes data to tailor interactions, boosting loyalty and sales.

**Example:** A coffee shop uses AI to track purchase history and sends personalized offers via app notifications to regular customers, encouraging repeat visits and boosting sales.

**AI Tools:** AI-enabled CRM systems like **Salesforce** or **HubSpot**.

**Benefit:** Personalized experiences increase customer retention, helping your business grow without losing your audience.

# 3. Make Smarter Decisions with Data

Scaling means making critical decisions—what to invest in, which products to promote, or how to price services. AI-powered analytics crunch large datasets to provide actionable insights.

**Example:** A fitness app uses AI to analyze user engagement and identify the most popular workout plans, enabling targeted marketing campaigns that bring more subscribers.

**AI Tools:** Platforms like **Google Analytics with AI** or **Power BI**.

**Benefit:** Data-driven decisions reduce risks and boost profits.

# 4. Streamline Marketing Efforts

AI marketing tools optimize campaigns, track results, and suggest content ideas without needing a large team.

**Example:** A bakery uses AI to analyze social media trends and create posts that resonate locally, increasing engagement and attracting more customers.

**AI Tools:** **Hootsuite Insights**, **AdEspresso**.

**Benefit:** Every marketing effort drives measurable business growth.

# 5. Optimize Supply Chain and Inventory

Product-based businesses face inventory and supply chain challenges. AI predicts demand, optimizes stock, and reduces waste.

**Example:** A clothing retailer uses AI to forecast holiday season sales, avoiding overstock and ensuring popular products are always available.

**AI Tools:** **NetSuite**, **TradeGecko**.

**Benefit:** Efficient inventory management ensures you’re ready for growth and can handle increasing customer demand.

# How to Get Started with AI in 2025

1. **Identify Pain Points:** Look at tasks that consume time or resources, like customer service or inventory management.
2. **Choose the Right Tools:** Start with user-friendly AI solutions like chatbots, analytics platforms, or task automation software.
3. **Test and Learn:** Run small experiments, measure results, and expand gradually.
4. **Train Your Team:** Ensure staff knows how to use AI effectively.
5. **Scale Gradually:** Expand AI use to other areas like marketing, sales, or supply chain.

# Why 2025 Is the Year to Embrace AI

AI is more accessible than ever. Cloud-based platforms, affordable subscriptions, and user-friendly tools mean even small businesses can compete. Customers now expect fast, personalized experiences, which AI delivers effortlessly.

Example: A local gym used an AI-powered app to send personalized workout tips to members, attracting new sign-ups and keeping current members engaged.

# Conclusion: Scale Smarter with AI

Scaling your business doesn’t have to be stressful. AI helps you automate tasks, personalize experiences, make smarter decisions, streamline marketing, and optimize inventory. The result? Seamless growth, happier customers, and more time to focus on your vision.

Start leveraging AI in 2025 to grow smarter, faster, and more efficiently.

1npaiz5,https://i.redd.it/2yhorjk2u3rf1.jpeg,Thoughts on bottomless portafilter,"Although I enjoy my morning cappuccino so much more than the morning cups of coffee I used to drink, I have found the espresso process to be quite messy. So I am not recommending the bottomless portafilter. I already bought a rolling tray for my Ninja but I also need a towel beside it due to the side effects of making espresso. 

The rolling cart to make it easier to fill the water tank on a countertop with cabinets overhead. It also prevents water running all over the counter and floor should you forget to empty your water drip tray. It also collects coffee dust from tamp and funnel area. 

The towel to wipe off the tamp before returning to its spot, padding to tamp the portafilter so it's not directly on countertop, place to knock pucks and tap milk, and lastly for accidental spills and coffee dust. 

I bought the bottomless portafilter for 2 reasons: to watch my espresso form and to make it easier to get the basket out. Watching my espresso form is not a good enough reason to deal with the other issues.

 First, it does not sit flat so tamping probably requires a stand, one more thing to buy. Otherwise, if not careful, you dump half your espresso grind all over the counter and floor ...in my case, the towel, counter and floor. Second, it is messier. In retrospect, I saw the splashing on some of the videos posted, but mine took it to another level. So I needed to raise my mug to the portafilter where you can no longer really watch the extraction. And I still had to clean off the entire back area and grinder side due to major splashing. 

Getting the basket out....the first go around, I couldn't get the basket out at all. It would not budge. I didn't want to risk denting the basket. They get easier to remove after a few cycles of heating and cooling anyway so I just waited. By the 4th go around, I could push the basket out. Only slightly easier than getting the basket out of the original Ninja. 

So, I will keep it as a back up, but it's not on my daily routine. ",1,1758716152.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False

1npai2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/livingfromtheend/comments/1npai2l/money_isnt_ghosting_you_command_it_with_these_6/,"Money Isn’t Ghosting You, Command It With These 6 Laws","Most people think they struggle with money because they don’t budget enough, invest right, or hustle hard enough. But the truth is, wealth doesn’t flow from effort alone, it flows from understanding.

If you’ve ever felt like money has a personal vendetta against you, it’s probably because you’ve been playing by the wrong rules. Wealth isn’t something you “chase” or “earn.” Wealth is something you **command.** And that requires a whole different mindset.

Here are **6 money laws that shift everything** once you understand them:

# Law #1: Your Words Are Your Wand

What you say about money creates your financial reality. Every phrase “I’m broke,” “I can’t afford that,” “Money is tight” is like placing an order with the universe.  
Stop declaring lack. Start commanding abundance:

* Instead of *“I can’t afford it”*, say *“I’m choosing to spend differently right now.”*
* Instead of *“I’m broke”*, say *“I’m in between fortunes.”*
* Instead of *“Money is tight”*, say *“Money flows to me easily and abundantly.”*

Your subconscious takes notes on every word. Speak your wealth into being.

# Law #2: Give to Receive (The Real Secret)

Giving proves to yourself and the universe that you already live in abundance. But giving out of desperation (“I hope this comes back multiplied”) doesn’t count. True giving is joyful, natural, and flowing.

It could be:

* Leaving an extra tip because you can
* Buying a coffee for a friend just because
* Offering a compliment or sharing something valuable

The more you give from a place of abundance, the more abundant you feel. And the more abundant you feel, the more abundance flows back.

# Law #3: Stop Trying to Deserve Wealth

Wealth isn’t a reward for being “good” or “hardworking.” It’s not a merit badge. It’s your birthright.

Think about it: you don’t have to prove you deserve air, sunlight, or your next heartbeat. Abundance is just as natural. The wealthy aren’t the most deserving, they’re simply the ones who gave themselves permission to prosper.

You were born worthy. Stop waiting for approval.

# Law #4: Expect Miracles, Don’t Micromanage Them

Most people demand wealth arrive in one specific way (the raise, the business win, the promotion). But abundance often shows up in ways we don’t expect:

* A refund
* A gift
* A random credit or check
* A new opportunity

Your job is not to control how, it’s to stay open to receive however it comes. The universe is infinitely creative. Trust it.

# Law #5: Act As If It’s Already Done

When you *know* your paycheck is coming on Friday, you don’t panic about it, you relax. That’s the energy of abundance.

Align with your future wealthy self:

* Handle unexpected bills with calm instead of panic
* Treat money with respect instead of fear
* Carry yourself like someone who already has a beautiful relationship with prosperity

This isn’t “fake it till you make it.” It’s embodying the energy of certainty.

# Law #6: Release the Outcome

Clinging too hard to results creates resistance. It’s like chasing a butterfly, the harder you run, the faster it flies away. But if you sit still, it lands on you effortlessly.

Desperation repels. Peaceful expectation attracts.  
Want money, but be okay if it doesn’t arrive exactly when or how you planned. That’s when miracles find you.

# Your 7-Day Action Plan (Try This Now)

  
Choose one principle that resonated with you the most, and commit to practicing it for the next 7 days. Not perfectly, not obsessively, just consistently. Just consistently. If it's watching your words, spend one week being intentional about your money talk. If it's giving, find small ways to share your abundance every day. If it's acting as if, make one decision each day from your future wealthy self.

1. Flip one money statement. If you usually say *“I can’t afford it,”* start saying *“I choose to prioritize differently.”*
2. Give something, time, money, kindness, value because you *can,* not because you expect a return.
3. Write down how your wealthy self would act in one small situation, then do it.
4. When financial worries show up, pause and say: *“I trust my good is coming in perfect timing.”* Then redirect your thoughts.

# The Real Secret

Abundance isn’t just about your bank account. It’s a way of being. Right now, you already live surrounded by wealth, knowledge, connection, music, beauty, opportunities. The more you recognize it, the more financial abundance flows as just another layer of prosperity.

Wealth isn’t something you have to deserve, justify, or chase. It’s your natural state. You are already worthy. And once you start acting from that truth, money begins to flow.

Which of these 6 laws hit you hardest? If you had to pick *one* to practice for the next 7 days, which would it be?

1npahsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1npahsj/getting_dumped/,Getting dumped,I had a relationship for 10 months with a 22 yo girl and I’m 26. I can tell that from both sides that relationship was really good we both feel the same love and butterflies. So the last 1.5 month we didn’t see each other much because I was studying for some exams that will be in a month. We spend some weeks apart but we talk by text and phone. About 2 weeks before I come back she mention that she feel lonely but she is working that on her mind. I ask her are you okay can u make it until I come back by that date? And she respond yeah I’m alright I can do it. And after one more week she become distant she didn’t  answer phone calls didn’t talk much or ask me a lot. So I call her one night while she was out with her sister and didn’t respond but instantly text me and say oh I miss the call I’m gonna call u later when I’m home. We talk that night and I ask her what is going on she told me again I’m feeling that I’m lonely that I feel that I’m just talking to someone and that I don’t have a relationship and all that. More days pass and when I get back I ask her out the first day and she use an excuse that her mom visit her and she can’t go out. The next day she use an excuse that she have period and apologise and reschedule for the next day. Guess what the next day again we didn’t go out and the same thing happen the other day and I ask her are you avoiding me and she respond with no I explain to you I couldn’t go out I’m sorry. After that we meet the next day for a coffee she told me that she doesn’t wanna break up and that she will try and I didn’t push her beg for anything but she saw in my eyes that I was kinda sad. We talked later by texts and that night she told me that im really confused that distance killed me and I’m not sure. I need some time to decide if I can keep up and trying I need some space and all those fake excuses. I text her one only messages and told her that okay take as much time as u need and if something change inside you you know where to find me if I also have any feelings then. She liked my message and respond with a good night and since then we haven’t talk and we are in no contact for a week. I will never again text her or call for sure and I’m gonna do radio silence for at least 2 weeks. I haven’t even check her profile I don’t even know if we still follow each other but she is also in radio silence and haven’t post anything. What are the odds or is any chance she might come back? For sure she might met someone else or she wanna test the grass but I don’t even care about that cause I can’t do anything about it and for sure I can’t fix what she destroy. And the big question is how long should I wait or it is even worth waiting because it a was a good relationship at all and she didn’t even give any time or chance to fix the emotional attraction that fallen from that distance. I also think that the reason isn’t the distance or the studying but the fact that something that bother her a lot and didn’t communicate it to me as much as she should plus she didn’t even give any time to see how things go cause u can’t lost your feeling in a month ,1,1758716056.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I keep telling myself that I quit before and I can quit again yet I haven't quit again yet. I don't even like smoking. I hate the smell. My boyfriend doesn't kiss me as much anymore because of it. I find myself rushing through the cigarette just to get it over with because of the time I'm wasting smoking. I hate the money I'm wasting on it. I hate the ashes that are left in my car. 

I'm going to try again today. I know what my triggers are. Mostly when I'm having my coffee in the morning and when I'm talking on the phone.

We are a couple in our late 30s with a preference for more comfortable accomodation (4-5 stars) in a convenient location where we can access food, coffee, convenience stores, restaurants, etc within a short walk from the hotel.

The Mrs likes a nice beach with clear waters whilst I like a good pool with availability of sunbeds or sunloungers.

Location wise we enjoy the peace and quiet but not at the expense of convenience . Being able to go for a stroll for food, amenities or a nightcap is a plus.

Budget is circa $500 AUD (THB 10.5K, USD$330).

Thanks in advance.

In short, we were dating for almost four years, had our ups and downs, grew together a lot, then it felt like we were growing in different directions and wanted different things from life. There were frustrations accumulated, fights, lack of sex, lack of intimacy, just routine, etc. We lived together for 3/4 years, basically moved in together almost one year into the relationship.
I got accepted to do my Erasmus last year, and he wanted to go work abroad for some extra money too - we saw that as an opportunity to go together. Things didn‘t work out for him, but I had my set date to leave, accomodation, etc. He tried to come as well, again things didn‘t work out logistically, I didn‘t feel like he was actually that motivated to come - throughout the last ~1 year of the relationship, when things started going south with everything mentioned above, I continuously felt as if he wasn‘t trying hard enough, I was doing my master‘s and workinng and doing handmade crafts on the side, while he was just working  - definitely not a problem, just that I felt like he didn‘t match my dynamic of let‘s do a lot of things, while I didn‘t match his dynamic of let‘s chill and take things slow.
Finally, I broke up with him while I was on my Erasmus - he was ready to settle down, have a family, but I just felt like I needed to break free and explore the world, I felt stuck in an endless loop of work and nothing else. He didn’t want to go out anymore, he wasn’t even going out with his friends, neither with me. We were just existing in an apartment, nit hanging oht with eachother, not going on dates, just… existing. I didn’t like his friends too much, nor did he like mine. Because we started avtually hanging out rarely, each time be was with his friends I was frustrated he s not going out with me, when I was with my friends he wanted to come too, etc. Shit developed into a toxic thing, even if we loved eachother and I still love him a lot.No, it wasn‘t about seeing someone else or the average Erasmus stereotypes of everyone having sex with everyone, I just didn‘t want to keep explaining myself, he was jealous and very scared - because we had our issues before, lack of sex, etc. he was 100% entitled to be worried I‘m not into him anymore - I was, just that for whatever reason my libido was straight to 0, I didn t feel like having sex at all, or doing anything dor that matter, it was just routine and I started feeling like I‘m wasting my life.
Anyway, we broke up, he suffered A LOT, for me it aas easier, I was away, new friends, etc, but he was back home living in our apartment which is basically my apartment. 
I came back in March this year, after 4 months of being broken up. He was supposed to move out but didn‘t and kept postponing it, and I was so scared not to get into that again, not to care about him again because I was worried if I did I might forget the reasons we broke up, and I 100% did not want to hurt him again. I told him a lot duringn the breakup that I love him and I want him to be happy and I was obviously not making him happy, he felt lost jealous scared, I was 2000km away… I didn‘t want him to go through panic and stress for 6 months. 
Anyway, I came back in March, intiailly it was awkward, still slept in the same bed, he wanted to cuddle, I wanted too but I didn‘t want to hurt him etc. Then of course this developed into us basically in the exact same situation, minus sex, but we still had sex especially in the early months when I returned. We lived in a very weird situationship of hugging and cuddlingn and eatinng together and going for coffee and always doing things for two, while „not dating“ and never asking questions about the whereabouts of the other. And we lied to ourselvwa that we are super good friends completely unhurt by our past together.
In August I left again for a trip, and we agreed he would funally make the step to move out while I am away si that it wouldn t be hurtful to pack from basically the house we lived in for four years. 
Realisation hit, he told me he wants to cut contact, that it‘s incredibly hurtful, we can still be friends but my idea of „friends“ was the weird ideal situationship we had. His idea was, of course, let me heal, I need space, I don‘t want to shut you out of my life, but I cannot do this, it hurts, I need to find myself.
I am only now processing the breakup. I feel like I am experiencing 1:1 what he was experiencinng in this house when I was in Belgium. I don‘t want to detail but it‘s SHIT. It‘s a month of constant crying and screaming and hopelessly texting him. We talked almost everyday, but it was mainly him telling me he needs space. I know I suck. I‘m just spiraling and panicking. The realisation of what it actually means ti lose him hit me. I am aware I sound like a complete asshole, it‘s been a full year and i m only now thinking „ooo i could ve worked on the relationship i still love him“. We saw eachother like once a week, each time because „i had to give him something of his“ - either I told him, or he asked me. It was a brief cigarette in the parking lot, followed by  ahug and a take care. No serious talks. I wrote him a letter apologising for hurting him and he avoided reading it for a long time, yesterday he said he read it.
I am struggling so hard not to contact him. I miss him like hell and I feel like I lost my chance in love because I didn‘t want to fight. I wanted different things one year ago than now, but now he doesn‘t want those things with me. He told me many times that it was hell for him and he never wants to go through that again.

The last thing that happened was yesterday, on the day I was back from a trip for my friend‘s bday, he randomly texted me he still needs me to bring him something from my house, some randkm documents he had here. I said ok, I‘ll stop by - I was happy to see him and finally in a good mood again. apparently my moods lately are directly related to if he texts or not, I feel so bad because even if he texts me to say he doesn‘t want to talk, my stupid little brain is happy that he texted.

Anyway, he said no, not at my place, near work - and I started panicking and asking him why (i know, i suck, paranoia me is a different person) and it all degenerated into me asking if he already moved in with a girl and him saying I am not entitled to ask that, it‘s his business if he‘s seeing someone or not, then asking me to stop texting and everything because he‘s seeing a girl, talking to girls, and it‘s shit for me to constantly call etc. 

He still has the keys to my house . I never asked them back, because I saw them as a tie between us. a „sometime in the future we ll meet to give me the keys“. yesterday after he said he s seeing a girl and insited more on that I told him ok, then let‘s arrange a time and day convenient for both of us, you give me the keys and I give you what else you hve left in the house, we get complete closure, talk everything out, and never look back“. he said ok. 

We had a more serious talk on this f2f, but still in a rush, we were in a parking lot and he hurried home - it kind of felt like he‘s not avtually seeing someone, but really wants to talk again with girls, date, go out, see what else is there, he picked up a hobby, goes out with friends on his days off work (when before he was just rotting in bed), etc, and he was stuck in the same perimeter and mentally stuck that he couldn t talk to any girl - which I totally understand, it feels weird doing that then cuddling with your ex while living at her place. He was so honest and just wants to experience this, to be happy, to see what else is there, to find someone to love again, etc. 

Anyway, I gave him the files he needed and asked again, as per our texts: when do me meet to end things nicely and maturely and hand out the keys and things? (i keep saying about that talk because since I came back in March, we never talked about our situation, just pretended we re happy best friends who cuddle, and there s a huge build up of unsaid things, he moved while I was away, we never properly said goodbye, it was like a storm). 
So he just goes yeayea we‘ll see we‘ll do that, and I said ok saturday i‘m going to our hometown, plan ahead, when do we meet? and he just went yea yea we ll agree yeayea we ll see. 
30minutes later, I see him again, literally in front of his house because a common friend had to meet up with him for some work related thing they work together, and I was supposed to hangout with the common friend after, and no I didn‘t just show up, I told him that I‘ll meet her and he said well then come by too when she comes, we‘ll hve a cigarette. Via text earlier, when he was at work, he was like „I’d give you the keys now to end everything and leave me alone, but of course I don’t hve them with me, I’m at work“ 
Then Again, we meet literally in front of his house  - he could habe had the keys, right? But didn‘t and absolutely did not mention that. 
I am still a bit delusional and I don‘t want to hang on to little things but I am hanging on to little things. Is he also keeping them as a link between us? I 100% understand what he is saying with seeing other people and what else is there for him - I was there too after our breakup. I never wanted to commit to lonng term as I was not ready nor healed (or, as I see it now, I still loved and wanted  him and didn‘t want to admit to myself) but I wanted to talk to other people, etc. 
Anyway, now I am struggling to NOT TEXT HIM like UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES. Especially because I don‘t really want those keys now… Oh and another thing - a few weeks back, we met again to give him some stuff from the house, and he randomly made a joke about how he’s not giving me the keys back and I took tht again as a sign he would come back - he now knows the door is open and I miss him and I want to work on myself and the relationship, i started therapy (he doesn t know that tho) He should be the one to text about the fucking keys. Or a stupid reason like the documents from yesterday - he got such a strong ego that if he didn’t want to see me at all he would die rather than text.

When I left for this trip last week, again I texted him hey i left/hey i arrived - i always did this even when in erasmus/past year, even if we didn‘t talk i always let him know i am safe as i am an anxious travller especially by plane but also car and in my head it was like „if smth happens know i thought about you“. So the next day when I saw he didn‘t reply to either „i left/i arrived“, I feel bad for reaching out ONCE AGAIN, and I delete the texts. He texts me to ask what I wrote,that I should thhink better before sending, I told him and he was all oh let me call you in my work break so you can tell me how was the roadtrip, take care, drink a beer for me too, enjoy, get some rest.. the call happened briefly but i was with people and the phone signal was shit, so we just kept saying oh we ll call tomorrow. next day he even apologised for not calling saying he was busy and we should call later, but same thing happened, i was with people we were in the car the signal was shit, so no call. Then next day I just sent him a pic from there he said it‘s pretty, then tht he s ok bla bla small talk… then I asked if we can finally call - no answer. Next day, I ask again, no answer. I know he has the notifications off with me - which I get, he doesn‘t want constant reminders from me. I panicked, I overstepped and called and multitexted him when he was not answering, he blocked me, I asked him to unblock me and I promised I wohldn’t do it again, and I’ll only let him know when I head home (14h drive I was scared and am used to him as my comfort). then the next day he texted me something like „how come you re not texting now“ (english not our first language, odd in trnaslation but you get the point), I decided to ignore him for like 2 more hours when I was supposed to start driving, to stick to the „I won t say anything apart from „hey i left/hey i arrived)““ - surprise surprise he texted me again then deleted everything and blocked me again… yesterday we met and I already told the story.

I don‘t know what the fuck is going on. We are both confused I guess, I really want him to give me another shot because I feel I can do better, I apologised a million times and he tells me that he forgave me long ago, otherwise we wouldn‘t be talking.. I realise I am shitty too.. 

How do I go about not texting him? It‘s such a habit, and now I feel better, but in one hour I will probably be spiraling again, and crying and regretting and wishing I‘d wake up from a bad dream and it‘s all good… Perhaps it‘s also because we avoided the relationship problems while still living together as „close friends“…
I am going to therapy later today, hope it will clear my head a bit. I am scared I lost him forever and there‘s nothing I can do, and the only thing I should do is do not contact him AT ALL and if he really says nothing about the keys, reach out in like one month just for that.

So I created [tinytummy.io](http://tinytummy.io/) for my wife help track our baby's daily nutritional intake, as well as provide food recommendations based on the nutrients that the baby is lacking. We showed this to a few or our friends and apparently they like it. Hence, we decided to make it available to the public.

I find it very weird that I can eat almost anything I want fast food milkshakes coffee energy drinks high caffeine drinks anything I want as if I never got my gallbladder removed but even if I only eat healthy food like salads lean meat tuna fish chicken turkey extremely low fat items vegetables I still gain weight like half a pound a day or half a pound to 1 lb a week it's just really random but I never drop weight Even if I only have protein powder and water and tea or black coffee I still don't lose weight I'll just gain weight. I almost feel like as of right now I have to basically just water fast maybe have like less than 500 calories a day but I don't know how you're supposed to do that if you work a full-time job. I really wish I went on an extreme diet before I had my surgery. By the way I'm a guy I know what a shocker I've noticed it's really only females getting the surgery and I haven't really met anybody that's a actual guy you know with a y chromosome that has gotten the surgery done because it's a little bit different I'm not a dainty person who is under 5/8 and can survive off of 1200 calories a day of celery with almond butter and a latte from Starbucks. I'm 6'4 full-time job where I'm running around getting you know 7 to 10 miles a day I can't really survive off a little bit of calories I tried doing that with a old diet of just protein shakes and I cut out all added sugars before my gallbladder surgery and that worked perfectly fine and I lost a lot of weight but now if I do it nothing happens I just gain weight. I've noticed lots of people who say that they don't gain any weight but then when you ask them what they eat they don't really eat anything so it's not really a good I guess example. I've met people who say they can eat whatever they want like I can eat whatever I want but guess what they're not skinny they are obese so it makes sense that cool you can eat whatever you want with our gallbladder but you will be obese for the rest of your life. Now I actually understand when some larger people claim that they can't lose weight medically because literally anything I do nothing happens. So at this point I just gave up I'm not I'm not doing anything as of right now I can go to Taco Bell and get a burrito and that one burrito will basically fill me up but I used to be able to eat like five burritos of one sitting or a three burritos and one sitting if I wanted to.

More sleep didn’t fix it.

Exercise left me even more drained.

Morning sunlight before screens

Journaling 5 minutes at night

A daily spray with nutrients I hadn’t been paying attention to

1npa5t6,https://i.redd.it/ego4s3dhq3rf1.jpeg,"Trip Report: 9/23 - PACKED Day at Epic, no Stardust, 2 Adults w/ Express","Summary: We had an excellent day. We rode every ride we wanted except Stardust due to it being closed. If you can afford Express, GET IT! The wait times were insane all day long for almost all rides but with express, we hardly had to wait to get on anything.   
  
We're both larger-than-average people and the only ride we felt squished on was Curse of the Werewolf. Ubers back and forth from Drury were $7-$11 each.   


9/23/25 - Hot and BUSY. Express passes were sold out for the day.   
-------------------  
We had a BLAST. We took a taxi to Epic and arrived around 9:30. There was no line at security and we headed in. 

We were going to grab a Starbucks but there were legit like 30 people in line -- we did NOT spend like $600 on Express passes for the day to wait in Starbucks. 

We, two un-caffeinated-30-somethings, headed to Super Nintendo World. 😅

🎮 SNW  
We took it all in and walked back to Donkey Kong Country to ride Mine Cart Madness.   
**Posted wait time was already 120 minutes but with express we walked ALLLLLLLLL the way toward the loading area and we were on the ride in around 15-20 minutes**. This ride is SO fun. I'm glad we were able to ride. 

After the ride, my boyfriend says ""That was better than coffee!!""  
We headed to the Mario Kart ride. 

New Fear Unlocked: He didn't see the big bump on the seat that goes between your legs and he smashed his nether region while sitting down. Those with external lower bits may want to heed caution. 

I got the high score for our ride and he says this was his least favorite ride of the whole day. 🤷🏻‍♀️ **Posted wait was 90 minutes and I think we were on in around 20 minutes.**

🐲 Isle of Burke  
Next up was Isle of Burke! We were HOT at this point and hopped in line for Fyre Drill. LOL this ride is... something. The best part of this ride is being mean to people on other boats and trying to soak them. **Posted wait was like 30 minutes and with express we were on in about 10 minutes.**

After than we headed to Hiccup's Wing Gliders to dry off. THIS RIDE IS SO FUN. With Stardust down, this is probably the most thrilling ride at the park. **Posted wait was 75 minutes and we were on in \~20 minutes.**

🪄 Paris  
Next on our list was hitting up Paris and BATM. By the time we got over there, the wait was OVER 300 MINUTES Y'ALL. The TM at the line said to come back before 7 because they were probably going to hit capacity and close the line. There were signs everywhere that said this ride was closing early. 

We watched Cirque Arcanus. With Express, I found there to be no reason at all to rush to get into line for this. You have to wait anyways! And every seat in the house is great. 

💀 Dark Universe  
There were threatening storms so even though we planned to save DU for night, we headed over to ride Curse of the Werewolf. **Posted wait was 75, we were on in 15-20 minutes.** Meh, ride is fine and fun. So short. 

Monsters Unchained was a 20 minute wait so we took the standby line. So much more of the animatronics and pre-show is working now! It was basically a walk on, no waiting. LOVE this ride so much. 

It was time for our planned break at our hotel, Drury, to check on our dog and grab some free drinks.   
  
🪄 Paris  
We got in our Uber back to Epic at exactly 6PM and BATM was only at 105 minutes! I made my BF power walk all the way from rideshare drop off to Paris. We got to the line by 6:43. With express, we walked ALLLLLLLLLLLLL the way to the very last hallway with stairs. We only waited in line for about 10 minutes and then we were on! This ride seemed to have more effects working than last time I was here! So fun, 10/10.

As we were exiting the ride, the lights were all flickering and dim! My BF said it seemed like we were running on generator power. When we got outside, EVERY SINGLE RIDE WAS DELAYED OR WEATHER DELAYED. I think the power went out y'all. I'm glad we got to ride BATM because it was delayed the rest of the night and then 'at capacity'. 

We headed back to DU and caught an INSANE LIGHTNING STORM over Frankenstein's castle -- Seriously one of the coolest things I've ever seen. While we were waiting, Monster's Unchained opened up again, and again, we walked on!   
  
By this time, we were SUPER tired. Satisfied with our rides for the day, we headed to Bar Helios for some drinks and to catch the fountain show. We took an uber back to Drury from Helios to save our feet the walk all the way back to the ride share area.   


""Is Express worth it?"" - Yes, to be honest, I would say this park is not worth it without Express. The lines were nuts most of the day. When things go on weather delay it's even worse. The last hour some rides did come down in wait times but otherwise the whole day, most rides were at LEAST a 75 minute wait.

It was definitely a major bummer that Stardust was closed, but hey, now we have something to look forward to for next time.

What could I have done better?,"This happen about a month ago that my gf of 8 months broke up with me. From my pov, we were locked in and I felt connected to her. I didnt feel like she would had broken up. 

I was calling her everyday, texting her good morning, and paying for dates when I could do something. I am in med school so my time is limited. So I didnt have time to do dates every weekend. instead I would go over her house like every day or plan a movie night. I still live with my parents due to taking out loans. 

Examples: I took her Chicago for a weekend. I took her to classy bars and restaurants. And I always broke her a coffee when I hung out with her. Btw, she rarely brought me anything in the relationship. That was something I told her that she needed to start doing because she wouldnt even buy me a coffee if she went out in the morning. 

We had very small problems in our relationships. The only thing I noticed is that we couldnt agree on alot of things but this was due to us being very different. However, we never got into an argument. The only time we had a problem was when I wasnt as present back in May due to studying for a major exam. I was stressed out so I didnt text alot and she got mad. After I talked her of why I was avoiding hanging out, she seem to understand. I also never did that again. 

  
Our last date was men taking her a steak restaurant to celebrate our 8 month anniversary. We seemed happy and we kissed. That night she saw a pic of sabrina carpenter on my instagram fvp. She told me that it made her uncomfortable. I talked it out with her that night and went home. The next day she broke up saying i never really loved her. 

She also blocked me and called me her toxic ex on tik tok. So im really hurt because she doesnt even want to be friends. I havent talked to her since August but I am curious is this normal? ",1,1758714720.0,AskWomenNoCensor,3,0.6,False

Coffee doesn't fix it. I've learned to plan around energy levels instead of just looking at my calendar.

**Always build in recovery time.** That dinner party or work conference? Block off the next day too. Recovery isn't optional, it's part of the actual event.

**Heat will destroy you.** A stuffy room or muggy weather can completely wreck me. I keep frozen berries in my freezer, cold packs for my wrists, and honestly a little desk fan has been a game changer.

**Weird sensations are normal.** The phantom phone buzzing, feeling like water's dripping on you, random pins and needles - super unsettling at first but you're not losing it.

**Describe symptoms in your own words.** I tell doctors it feels ""like ants under my skin"" or whatever makes sense to me. Way more helpful than medical terms I don't really understand.

**Don't let doctors brush you off.** ""Wait and see"" shouldn't go on forever. Push for referrals or get a second opinion. You're not being dramatic.

**Write stuff down before appointments.** Brain fog hits hard in medical settings. I literally hand my doctor a piece of paper with my main questions.

**DMT decisions suck.** Don't feel bad about being overwhelmed by all the options. I asked people HOW they decided, not just what they picked. Way more useful.

**Some online communities that actually help:**

* [Shift.ms](http://Shift.ms) is pretty chill, low drama
* MS Society has solid resources and good irl support groups in UK & US
* MSTwins is a helpful app for finding people with similar experiences & global !
* Juno: Chronic Illness Support is an app which is pretty cute and weirdly comforting when brain fog hits and I need to vent
* MyMSTeam has some really nice people :) 

**Communication tips:**

* ""I sometimes cancel last minute because of health stuff"" works better than launching into MS explanations
* At work, focus on what you need (""I need sitting breaks"") not your whole medical history

**Make a flare plan NOW.** Who to call, what meds, what helps - put it in your phone like it's a fire escape plan.

**Gentle movement helps.** Even resistance bands or basic PT exercises make a difference. Don't need to be a gym hero.

**Learn your rights early.** Disability stuff, insurance, work accommodations - figure it out before you desperately need it.

**Technology saves my ass.** Pill reminder apps, shared calendars, template texts for canceling plans, Juno for venting. No shame in using every tool available.

**Bad days happen but they're not permanent.** Grief comes in waves but so do good moments. A rough patch is just data, not your whole future.

**People say dumb things.** Have a standard response ready so you don't waste energy on it every time.

**Steal ideas from others.** Best cooling tricks, symptom descriptions, life hacks - the community has figured out so much stuff already.",34,1758714552.0,MultipleSclerosis,5,1.0,False
1np9yvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1np9yvh/from_8_hours_to_30_minutes_how_i_finally_broke_my/,From 8 hours to 30 minutes - how I finally broke my phone addiction,"I'm honestly ashamed to write this… but my screen time was averaging 8 hours a day (mostly social media videos)… it was completely destroying my focus and relationships.

The scary part is how it just sneaks up on you…

**Morning:** scroll in bed (1.5+ hrs)  
**Coffee/meals:** always with my phone (45+ mins)  
**After work:** ""quick check"" that turns into hours (2.5 hrs)  
**Before bed:** ""just 10 minutes"" becomes 2+ hours  
**Middle of the night:** when I can't sleep, more scrolling (1+ hr)  
**Random throughout the day:** (1.5 hrs)

I finally hit my breaking point when I realized I'd spent an entire Saturday just… scrolling. Like literally the whole day was gone.

So I went nuclear and tried a bunch of strategies I found here on reddit...

**1) Phone goes to grayscale after 6pm**  
I absolutely hate how it looks… which is exactly the point. Everything becomes so much less appealing when it's not designed to hijack your brain with colors and notifications.

**2) Complete social media blackout from 9pm to 9am**  
Those late night and early morning sessions were the worst for my mental health. I felt like garbage every single time. Now I can still watch Netflix at night, but at least I'm actually watching instead of splitting my attention.

**3) Earned screen time blockers (this one's brutal but works)**  
Yeah, screen time blockers. Everyone talks about them because they actually work. Doesn't matter which app you use. I set mine to block everything and you have to earn screen time throughout the day. I made it ridiculously hard on myself... 30 minute workout only gets me 5 minutes of screen time. It sounds extreme but it completely flipped my relationship with my phone. The app i used is called “Reload” and helped as i can set tasks while i have apps blocked. Extremely useful.

**4) Actually replace the habit with stuff I enjoy**  
This was huge. You can't just remove something without filling the void.

I had a stack of books I bought months ago just sitting there, so now I keep one with me for those random 5-minute gaps.

My keyboard was literally gathering dust in the corner. Now I mess around with it for 20-30 minutes most days and it's honestly more satisfying than any video I've ever watched.

I've been texting old friends I'd been meaning to reach out to but never did because I was too busy being ""busy"" on my phone.

And I'm actually learning Spanish (slowly) instead of just saving ""learn Spanish"" videos that I never watch again.

**The results are honestly wild.** I have so much more mental energy. I'm not constantly anxious about missing something. And I'm actually doing things I've been saying I wanted to do for years.

Still not perfect, but going from 8 hours to 90 minutes feels like getting my life back.",21,1758714486.0,productivity,4,0.96,False
1np9y7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1np9y7y/helpi_need_to_find_this_title_and_story/,Help..I need to find this title and story!,"I saw a new message pop up on my biker’s phone screen from a woman named “Kathy.”
[ You can't just dump me like this, this baby is yours, Shadow! Call me back or I'll call your wife! ]
I froze at these words. What's going on?
I scrolled through the screen like crazy and found that their first message was from a year ago, when we had just confirmed our relationship.
I couldn't breathe. My chest felt tight as I tried to make sense of it all. How could this be happening?
The text messages recorded all the disgusting flirting words they said to each other, and even included pornographic photos and hotel room records.
I felt bile rising in my throat, each message like a dagger stabbing deeper into my heart.
————————
I was cozied up on my boyfriend Jake's couch, my eyes glued to my phone screen, lost in the mindless scroll of social media. The apartment was quiet, save for the soft hum of the air conditioner. Jake had gone out for his daily bike ride, something he did religiously, and I was used to waiting for him to get back. We had been dating for a little over a year, and things between us had been, or so I thought, pretty much perfect.
As I sat there, his phone, which was lying on the coffee table, suddenly lit up with a new message. At first, I didn't pay it much heed. It was just another notification in a world full of them. But then, I saw the name ""Kathy"" on the screen, and something about it made my heart skip a beat. There was a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach, an intuition that this wasn't just an ordinary message.
Curiosity, that insatiable beast, got the better of me. I leaned in, my eyes narrowing as I tried to make out the words on the screen. The message was short, but it felt like a punch to the gut. ""You can't just dump me like this, this baby is yours! Call me or I'll call your wife!""
I froze. My breath caught in my throat, and my eyes widened in disbelief. I read those words over and over again, as if hoping that somehow, with each new reading, they would change, that this was all just a cruel joke. ""What's going on?"" I whispered to myself, my voice barely audible, trembling with a mix of shock and horror. I felt like the ground had been yanked out from under me, like I was standing on the edge of a precipice, about to plunge into an abyss of pain and confusion.
Jake had never mentioned a Kathy. In all our conversations, in all the time we had spent together, not once had he uttered that name. And the mention of a baby and his ""wife"" was completely mind - boggling. I knew we weren't married, so who on earth was this ""wife"" she was talking about?
Without thinking, my hand reached out for his phone. I knew it was an invasion of privacy, a violation of the trust we were supposed to have in our relationship. But in that moment, I didn't care. I needed answers, and I needed them now. My hands were shaking so violently that I fumbled with the phone, trying to unlock it. My heart was pounding in my chest like a jackhammer, so loud that I could hear it in my ears, drowning out all other sounds.
Once I managed to unlock the phone, I scrolled through the screen like a woman possessed. My eyes darted from one message to another, searching for any clue that would explain this nightmare I had suddenly found myself in. And what I found was worse than I could have ever imagined.
To my horror, I discovered that their first message was from a year ago, just around the time Jake and I had confirmed our relationship. I let out a choked sob, a sound that seemed to come from the very depths of my soul. ""How could this be happening?"" I asked, my voice breaking, a single tear rolling down my cheek. I felt like I was trapped in a bad dream, one from which I couldn't wake up, no matter how hard I tried.
The text messages were a sickening display of their relationship. There were all the disgusting flirting words they had said to each other, words that made my skin crawl. Jake, the man I thought I knew so well, the man I had fallen in love with, had been sending the most vulgar and intimate messages to this woman. And then, there were the pornographic photos. I felt my face flush with a mix of anger and shame as I scrolled through them. I wanted to look away, to close my eyes and pretend I had never seen them, but my eyes were glued to the screen, and the images were already burned into my memory.
The hotel room records were the final nail in the coffin. Dates and times of their trysts, places I had never even heard of. I felt bile rising in my throat, a physical reaction to the betrayal I was uncovering. Each message, each photo, each record was like a dagger stabbing deeper and deeper into my heart. I couldn't believe that I had been so blind. How had I not seen the signs? All those times he had been late coming home, all the excuses he had made. How could I have been so naive to believe him?
I sat there for what felt like hours, my mind racing a million miles a minute. I thought about all the times Jake had been on his phone, smiling to himself, and when I asked, he would just brush it off. I remembered the nights when he would be distant, lost in his own thoughts, and I had just assumed he was tired from work. I had trusted him with my heart, and he had betrayed me in the worst way possible.
I was angry, so incredibly angry. Angry at Jake for lying to me, for cheating on me. Angry at Kathy for being a part of this sordid affair. But most of all, I was angry at myself for being so stupid, for being so easily deceived. How could I have let this happen? I felt like I was a fool, a victim of my own trust and naivete.
Finally, I heard the sound of Jake's key in the lock. Panic surged through me. I quickly wiped away my tears, trying to compose myself. I didn't want him to see me like this, broken and defeated. I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves, but my hands were still shaking.
He walked in, looking sweaty and happy from his bike ride. His face was flushed, and he had a big smile on his face. ""Hey, babe!"" he said, his voice full of energy. But his smile faded the moment he saw my face. He could tell something was wrong. I could see the concern in his eyes, but I knew it was just an act.
""What's wrong?"" he asked, walking towards me. I stood up, my hands balled into fists, my knuckles white from the pressure. ""Don't you 'what's wrong' me, Jake!"" I shouted, my voice filled with rage. ""I know everything!"" His face paled instantly, and I could see the guilt in his eyes. It was like a mask had been ripped off, and I was finally seeing him for who he really was.
""What are you talking about?"" he asked, trying to play dumb, but his voice was shaky, and I could tell he was scared.
""Don't play stupid with me!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the apartment. ""I saw the messages from Kathy. The baby, the flirting, the hotel rooms. How could you do this to me?"" Jake opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. He just stood there, looking at me with a mix of fear and regret, like a deer caught in the headlights.
""How long has this been going on?"" I asked, my voice calmer now, but the pain still evident in every word. Jake looked down at his feet, unable to meet my eyes. ""A year,"" he mumbled, his voice barely audible. I let out a bitter laugh, a laugh that was filled with pain and disbelief. ""A year? Since the beginning of our relationship?"" He nodded, still not looking at me.
I felt a new wave of anger wash over me, a wave so powerful that I thought I might explode. ""And what about this 'wife' she's talking about? Who is she?"" Jake sighed, a long, drawn - out sigh. ""It's complicated,"" he said, his voice sounding tired.
""No, it's not!"" I screamed, my voice cracking. ""Either you're married or you're not!"" Jake finally looked up at me, his eyes filled with a mix of emotions. ""I'm married,"" he said. ""But it's not what you think. We were separated when I met you.""
I didn't believe him. How could I? After all the lies, all the betrayal, his words meant nothing to me. ""Separated or not, you lied to me. You cheated on me. And now there's a baby involved!"" I was crying again, big, fat tears streaming down my face. I felt like my heart was being ripped into a million pieces.
Jake took a step towards me, his hand outstretched, as if he wanted to comfort me. But I backed away, my eyes filled with hatred. ""Don't touch me!"" I shouted. ""I never want to see you again."" With that, I grabbed my things and ran out of his apartment, not looking back. I could hear him calling my name, but I ignored him. I ran down the street, my heart pounding in my chest, not knowing where I was going. I just knew that I needed to get away from him, from the lies, from the pain.
I found myself at a park, sitting on a bench. I was sobbing uncontrollably, my body shaking with each sob. People were looking at me, but I didn't care. I felt like my whole world had just been destroyed, like everything I had ever believed in was a lie. I thought about all the plans I had made with Jake, all the dreams we had shared. We had talked about traveling the world together, about buying a house, starting a family. It was all a lie.
After a while, I started to calm down, my sobs turning into quiet sniffles. I knew I couldn't just sit there and cry forever. I needed to figure out what to do next. I thought about calling my friends, but I was too embarrassed. How could I tell them that I had been dating a married man and that he had cheated on me? I felt like such a fool.
I decided to go home. I needed to be in a familiar place, surrounded by my own things. When I got home, I took a long, hot shower. I stood under the water, letting it pour over me, hoping that it would wash away all the dirt and grime of the betrayal. I scrubbed my skin until it was red, as if trying to erase every memory of Jake.
After my shower, I put on my most comfortable pajamas and crawled into bed. I lay there, staring at the ceiling, my mind still racing. I thought about all the legal implications. Was I in trouble for being involved with a married man? What about the baby? Did I have any rights? I knew I needed to talk to someone, but I didn't know who. I felt so alone, like I was adrift in a stormy sea with no lifeboat.
The next day, I called in sick to work. I couldn't face anyone, not in the state I was in. I spent the day on the couch, watching mindless TV, trying to numb the pain. Every now and then, my phone would buzz with a message from Jake. I ignored them all. I didn't want to hear his excuses. I didn't want to hear anything from him ever again.
A few days later, I decided to see a lawyer. I needed to know where I stood, what my rights were. I made an appointment and went to the lawyer's office. The lawyer, a middle - aged man with a kind face, listened to my story, his face sympathetic. He told me that legally, I wasn't in any trouble. But he also said that dealing with a situation like this could be messy, especially with a baby involved. He gave me some advice on how to proceed, on how to protect myself.
I left the lawyer's office feeling a little more empowered. I knew I had to take control of the situation. I couldn't let Jake and Kathy get away with what they had done. I decided to reach out to Kathy. I needed to hear her side of the story, to see if she was as much a victim as I was.
I found her number in Jake's phone and called her. My heart was pounding in my chest as I waited for her to answer. She answered on the third ring. ""Hello?"" she said, her voice cautious, as if she knew who was on the other end.
""Kathy, this is [Your Name]. We need to talk."" There was a long silence on the other end of the line. I could hear her breathing, could sense her unease. ""How did you get my number?"" she finally asked.

1np9wke,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1np9wke/learn_from_my_mistakes/,Learn from my mistakes,"So I've needed to trim some fat a couple of times before and I wanted to share what I learned and some mistakes I made recently. 

5'5"" woman, big busted and curvy (so I naturally carry more fat). At my heaviest I weighted 148 and at my lowest I was 120 (which was ideal when I wasn't working out, now this would be far too skinny I think)

The first time I consciously lost weight I was successful but it was rough. It was several years ago and I lost half a pound to two pounds every week by following myFitnessPal eating just 1200-1400 calories a day. I found it was much easier when I started walking every day after work for an hour (I like to use that time to call friends and family to catch up) as it gave me another few hundred calories a day. It did work though. I lost 25lbs in 6 months or so, just in time for my wedding. 
Personally, I would only recommend doing this if exercise isn't an option for you right now. It took a lot of will power and if I was doing it again I would focus on eating high volume foods.

Something I personally have found helpful, regardless of my overall approach to weightloss, has been skipping breakfast. I know for some people that's not an option and I respect that. For me? I'm good with a cup or two of coffee until lunch time. If I'm really hungry that day, I'll have an earlier lunch. But fasting past breakfast definitely made it easier to save the bulk of my calories for my evening cravings.

The second time I decided to lose weight was last November when the scale started to creap back up on me. This time, I decided to start going to the gym. However, after going to the gym for 9 months now, I looked back on my progress via the inBody scans from the gym and was surprised. Between November and May, I was really starving myself and yet not only had I not lost any weight, I hadn't put on any muscle either! Essentially, I had been starving myself and going to the gym for no reason. Now, mind you, I wasn't tracking my calories this time around, but clearly, that strategy didn't work at all since I was just starving my muscles of the food they needed to grow.
What DID work was around May, I stopped starving myself and decided I was just going to eat at Maintenance calories. I kept going to the gym and the result was I didn't put on any fat, but I DID put on 2.5lbs of muscle (finally!). So yes, the scale has gone up a bit, but the changes in my toned muscles is visible and I feel better about my body. 
So now, I'm eating a reasonable diet, high in veggies, fruits, whole grains and protein, and I am just focused on lifting heavy at the gym with progressive overload. I'll update with the progress later, but even though I'm not as obsessed with the scale or calories, I already feel much better about my body. I think weight loss should always involve movement. Whether that's walking, weightlifting, hiking, swimming, boxing, etc. I also now believe that just because you wanna lose fat doesn't mean you shouldn't fuel your body appropriately.

Restaurant chairs aren’t just about seating—they define your space’s comfort, aesthetics, and durability. India has emerged as a hub for hospitality furniture manufacturing, offering a blend of craftsmanship, competitive pricing, and global export quality.

In this guide, we’ll cover the Top 12 Restaurant Chairs Furniture Manufacturers in India, starting with one of the most established names—Best of Exports—followed by lesser-known yet promising brands that deserve attention.

# Best of Exports: Premium Restaurant Chairs Furniture Manufacturers in India

When it comes to [restaurant chairs manufacturers](https://bestofexports.com/restaurant-furniture/restaurant-chairs/) in India, one name that consistently stands out is Best of Exports. Based in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, this company has carved a niche as a specialist in hospitality and restaurant furniture, serving both domestic and international markets.

**Why Best of Exports Stands Out**

1. **Wide Design Range** Best of Exports caters to diverse design preferences, from rustic wooden chairs to sleek industrial seating and elegant upholstered dining chairs. Their catalog is flexible enough to serve high-end hotels, casual cafés, and resort lounges.
2. **Customizable Solutions** Unlike many mass-producers, Best of Exports emphasizes customization. Restaurateurs can choose materials like reclaimed wood, rattan, cane, or metal frames, ensuring furniture aligns with the brand’s theme.
3. **Export Expertise** What truly sets them apart is their export orientation. They maintain strict quality control, international packaging standards, and timely logistics—making them reliable for global buyers seeking bulk restaurant seating solutions.
4. **Sustainability Focus** The company actively promotes eco-friendly materials, tapping into the rising demand for sustainable furniture. Chairs made from reclaimed wood and natural fibers blend durability with environmental responsibility.
5. **Scalability for Bulk Orders** For restaurant chains, uniformity is crucial. Best of Exports has the infrastructure to deliver consistent finishes, identical dimensions, and reliable large-scale production.

**Ideal For**

* Restaurant chains expanding across multiple outlets
* Hotels and resorts looking for premium hospitality seating
* Café owners wanting trendy, durable designs with global appeal

With its combination of craftsmanship, scalability, and export readiness, **Best of Exports** is a go-to choice for anyone serious about high-quality restaurant furniture in India.

# Shree Swastik Furniture

Shree Swastik Furniture is a regional brand making its mark in the hospitality sector. Known for producing sturdy dining chairs, visitor seating, and custom commercial furniture, they serve mid-range restaurants and hotels that prioritize affordability without compromising too much on quality.

Their strength lies in offering practical, durable pieces designed for high-traffic environments. While they may not have extensive online visibility, Shree Swastik’s local reputation and ability to handle bulk orders make them a valuable option for restaurateurs working with moderate budgets.

# Sankheda Furniture

Originating from Gujarat, **Sankheda furniture** is world-famous for its **lacquered teak wood craftsmanship**. Though traditionally used in homes and ceremonial furniture, Sankheda artisans also create chairs and benches that bring cultural charm to hospitality spaces.

For boutique restaurants, cafés, or resorts seeking a heritage vibe, Sankheda chairs are unmatched. Their intricate patterns, glossy finishes, and traditional designs add a unique character that mass-produced seating simply cannot replicate.

# Varsha Kitchen

Varsha Kitchen primarily operates in the kitchen equipment domain but has branched into **restaurant seating and dining solutions**. They provide one-stop furnishing packages for small restaurants, often combining kitchen setups with complementary furniture.

Their chairs tend to be simple, functional, and geared toward utility rather than heavy design. For budget-friendly setups or quick launches, Varsha Kitchen can be a practical choice.

# Ampre Hospitality

As the name suggests, Ampre Hospitality focuses on **end-to-end furnishing for the hospitality sector**. They specialize in custom chairs, bar stools, lounge seating, and outdoor furniture for hotels and resorts.

Ampre works closely with interior designers, providing tailored furniture that fits specific themes. Their emphasis on design collaboration makes them suitable for upscale projects where aesthetics are just as important as durability.

# The Coffee Concept

With India’s café culture booming, **The Coffee Concept** has emerged as a niche player catering specifically to coffee shops and casual dining spaces. Their chairs are designed to be lightweight, trendy, and space-efficient—perfect for small cafés and bistros.

Expect modern wooden chairs, minimalist stools, and quirky seating that resonates with youthful audiences. If you’re designing a café with Instagram-worthy interiors, The Coffee Concept should be on your radar.

# CocktailKompany

CocktailKompany is a name associated with **bar furniture and lounge seating**. Their forte lies in high chairs, bar stools, and counter seating designed for vibrant nightlife spaces.

Restaurants and bars that want to elevate their ambiance with stylish, durable bar seating will find CocktailKompany’s offerings appealing. Their designs focus on comfort and sturdiness, ensuring guests can enjoy long evenings without discomfort.

# Lotus Eco Beach Resort (In-House Designs)

Lotus Eco Beach Resort is known primarily as a resort chain, but their **in-house furniture sourcing and collaborations** make them noteworthy. They design and commission chairs suited for beachside dining, outdoor patios, and poolside lounges.

Their emphasis on **weather-resistant materials** like treated wood and synthetic wicker provides insights into what works in coastal hospitality furniture. For restaurateurs setting up in outdoor or resort locations, their design approach is highly relevant.

# Geeken Seating Collection

Geeken Seating Collection is a well-established office furniture brand but has expanded into **hospitality and dining seating**. Their catalog includes modular dining chairs, café seating, and upholstered options designed for comfort and durability.

Known for ergonomic designs, Geeken brings an office-grade approach to hospitality furniture—prioritizing posture, comfort, and long-term use. For restaurants that value comfort as much as style, Geeken is a strong contender.

# Other Noteworthy Restaurant Chair Manufacturers

Apart from the above, India hosts many furniture makers catering to hospitality. Here are three more worth mentioning:

1. **Durian Furniture** – Popular across India for home and office furniture, they also supply durable dining chairs suitable for restaurants.
2. **Evok by Hindware** – Known for stylish retail furniture, Evok’s dining collections often fit café and restaurant settings.
3. **Urban Ladder (Hospitality Division)** – Though primarily consumer-focused, they cater to boutique hotels and restaurants seeking ready-made designs.

# How to Choose the Right Restaurant Chair Manufacturer

When selecting from these **restaurant furniture manufacturers in India**, consider:

* **Durability**: Heavy-duty use demands strong joints, treated wood, or reinforced metal frames.
* **Aesthetics**: Chairs should match your restaurant’s theme—rustic, industrial, modern, or traditional.
* **Customization**: Some manufacturers allow you to tweak fabrics, finishes, and dimensions.
* **Scalability**: For multi-branch chains, ensure suppliers can handle bulk orders with consistent quality.
* **Budget**: Match your spend with expected lifespan—premium chairs often save money long-term.
* **After-Sales Support**: Replacement cushions, repairs, or warranty services are essential for hospitality setups.

# Final Thoughts

India’s restaurant chair manufacturing sector is diverse, offering everything from **heritage-inspired Sankheda chairs** to **export-ready solutions from Best of Exports**. For premium quality and global scalability, Best of Exports is the clear leader. But lesser-known names like Shree Swastik Furniture, The Coffee Concept, and Ampre Hospitality also deserve attention, especially for restaurateurs seeking niche designs or cost-effective options.

1np9tu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1np9tu8/best_learning_tool_for_a_beginner/,Best learning tool for a beginner,"Hi!

I started going down the rabbit hole of roasting lately, but I wanted to ask some recurrent questions before I make my 1st purchase... maybe from a bit different angle.

I am looking for a home roaster and there's two key factors I take into account:
- Which of the roasters do you see as a good learning tool, that may in future be translated to commercial equipment skills?
- Smell - I will have to roast indoor and I wonder which of the roasters have best filters and/or good way to connect it to the kitchen hood to avoid the apartment smelling like coffee 24/7. Or maybe, it's just unavoidable that the scent will remain and I shouldn't start until I will find a place outside to do it?

I see 3 typically recommended roasters:
* Behmor - seems like a good tool, but without option of connection to Artisan (or so I believe). It seems to me like a good hobby machine, but with little similarity to commercial devices.
* SR800 modded to support Artisan - seems like a stronger candidate, but I wonder what your experience is and if modding it is possible for not trained (no electronic/electrical/engineering background) person.
* Skywalker Delta - more expensive device, but is it worth the price?

I wonder what your opinions are, especially from people who started at home and now worked their way up to professional roasting.",1,1758714051.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

Having a house full of wooden furniture and flooring can be visually rewarding, but scratches and water stains are inevitable. While cleaning up after a family gathering, I noticed a few scratches on our dining table that looked like little scars on an otherwise flawless surface. That’s when I decided to try out the Original Wood Surface Scratch and Stain Remover, a product often mentioned for quick scratch fixes. This review will share my hands-on experience with the product.

**Design and Packaging**

The moment I unwrapped the Tibet Almond Stick, I was intrigued. It's housed in neat tin packaging, giving a premium yet practical touch. The sticks themselves are tightly rolled cotton soaked in the brand's “secret family formula.” The size is compact, easy to store in a drawer or cabinet, and very convenient to pull out whenever an impromptu scratch-removal session is necessary. The simplicity of its design reflects its ease of use, with no additional equipment or steps required.  

[Discover if The Original Wood Surface Scratch and Stain Remover is on sale at Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b01jgx86m0/)

**Ease of Use**

Using the Tibet Almond Stick was surprisingly simple, even for someone like me who doesn’t fuss around with DIY maintenance often. You just unwrap the foil, rub the stick onto the scratched area, and wipe off the excess with a tissue. There's no need to mess with peeling labels or cutting the stick, which I appreciated. I tried it on three different surfaces: a coffee table, the dining table, and a wooden cabinet. In all cases, the application was quick without any drips or mess. It took less than five minutes, and there wasn’t any strong or unpleasant smell, making it friendly for indoor use.

**Effectiveness on Light Scratches**

This product is specifically marketed for light scratches, and that’s exactly where it excels. On the dining table, those shallow marks left by my car keys disappeared after rubbing the stick on the affected spot. It worked like a charm on water rings too, especially on the cabinet in our living room. However, it’s worth noting that deep scratches or gouges were less forgiving. A significant scratch on our wood flooring didn't completely vanish, so this product isn’t a miracle worker for more severe damage.

**The Materials and Formula**

One of the most fascinating aspects of the scratch remover is its colorless formula. Once applied, it doesn’t alter the look of the furniture’s finish, ensuring the wood retains its natural texture and tone. The tightly rolled cotton also prevents overapplication, so that the liquid is distributed only over the targeted area. This innovation stems from years of tradition, as the product is rooted in a family business that’s now in its fourth generation of manufacturing.

**Positives**

- Quick and easy application process  
- Effectively hides light scratches and water stains  
- Compact size and practical packaging allow for easy storage  
- Safe formula that doesn’t change the color or texture of the wood  
- Made by a family-operated business in the USA  

**Critiques**

- Limited to light surface scratches; less effective for deep scratches or gouges  
- Not ideal for bleached finishes  

**Peer Products**

Comparing this scratch remover with other popular products like furniture pens and wax sticks sheds light on its unique qualities. While wax sticks tend to fill deeper scratches and furniture pens offer a bit of color correction, they often leave behind a visible residue that looks unnatural. The Tibet Almond Stick, with its scratch-hiding, colorless formula, feels like the better option when dealing with minor blemishes on natural wood. For larger, deeper damage, products like wax-based fillers might still be necessary. 

**Worth Every Penny**

Looking through the lens of cost-effectiveness, this product holds its own. Its specialty lies in its targeted use—unlike multipurpose cleaners or repair solutions, it is designed specifically for light scratches and minor marks. While there are cheaper alternatives, they often lack the same finesse and ease of use that this scratch remover offers. In my opinion, its simplicity and performance balance justify the investment, especially if you want reliable touch-ups for wooden surfaces.

1np9q7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1np9q7m/list_of_mils_weird_behavior_surrounding_food/,List of MIL's weird behavior surrounding food,"It’s been really nice in my previous post to get feedback from people who aren’t excusing everything away. I really appreciate the perspective of this group and a few people were pointing out the weirdness of MIL expecting me to order her food, so I thought I might entertain you with some of the odd food related things she has done over the years.

 We are currently NC and she lives far away, so this is just a ridiculous walk down memory lane, and I am curious if anyone has insight into these behaviors I don't understand or might be misinterpreting. I truly don't understand this woman and I am always grasping trying to rationalize what is happening.

\-She drinks coffee nonstop all day, and she likes to re-heat it in the microwave regularly. This means that if I am cooking, she will come in the kitchen and use her body to shove me out of the way of the microwave while I am actively cooking on the cooktop under it. No “excuse me” or explanation, just this woman who is much shorter than I am, hip checking me out of the way and opening the microwave door into my face. It’s the single most frustrating thing she does, because she treats me like an obstacle and not a human.

\-She usually expects me to order her food. I try to avoid this by having her look at menus in advance- she shuts down and won’t do it and gets extra squirmy and weird about not wanting to choose her own food. I have never understood it, and the only context that makes sense is that she knows she won’t be happy with anything so she wants to be able to blame someone else. It could be something different, sometimes I suspect she has an eating disorder OR some extreme anxiety about eating around other people or being judged. But she always has passive aggressive comments about how my choices aren’t right, and she seems to expect me to guess what she wants. So she spends her time perpetually disappointed that she doesn’t have what she wants, and what she has isn’t good enough. We hardly ever take her out to eat anymore because I am just more comfortable feeding everyone at home where she can take it or leave it and I don't get decision fatigue of choosing food for all the kids AND and adult.

\-I mentioned in a past comment that she yelled at me, loudly, in a McDonalds playplace for supervising the kids playing and not ordering food for everyone… while DH was actively ordering food for everyone. She acted like her son was either not competent to order the food, or shouldn’t have to order the food? I’m not sure. But since he was the one to order it, she couldn’t complain about the food choices like she would have if it was me… so instead she spent the whole time fixated on how that McDonalds had personally insulted her by keeping napkins where she has to ask for them instead of out for grabbing, that made her feel like a thief. It was miserable.

\-We were traveling and decided to order pizza at our hotel, she told me to order “anything.” After I called in the order, she confronted me about making sure I ordered a salad… I did not, because it wasn’t on my radar at all to look for salad at a pizza place and she said she would eat anything. She got huffy about the salad so I told her to go with DH to pick it up, and they could stop and get a salad along the way. They came back with the order and a salad, she ate one bite of the salad. It ended up getting tossed. She ate pizza, but when she went for a second slice she complained to me that the pizza I ordered has slices that are too big (like I am in control of that?) I asked her if she needed me to cut her a smaller piece like I do for the kids, which admittedly was snarky on my part because I felt like her phrasing was blaming me for the pizza slice size. She got huffy and shut down and refused to eat anything else, sat in the hotel room sulking and watching us eat.

\-I am Italian heritage (American). On one of her visits I shared that I planned to make homemade meatballs for dinner, then while I was putting one of the kids down for a nap she took the ground beef out of the fridge and made her own meatballs. No recipe, just her own imagining of what should be in a meatball. MIL admitted that she doesn’t ever make meatballs… It turns out she was scared I would put breadcrumbs in them and she didn’t want the extra carbs, so she made little disgusting meat pucks to prevent me from making real meatballs. No one, including her, could eat them and it wasted the food as well as took away my opportunity to share my family heritage/food with the family. She ruined dinner for everyone instead of just abstaining from eating a meatball. Same visit, I was planning to make a pie and she took the ingredients and started it, so I have no idea what she put in it or left out she just handed me a half-made pumpkin pie filling and expected me to take it from there. It surprisingly turned out fine. Now I know to just not tell her the plan for cooking, so that she can’t sabotage it and stomp all over my plans to cook.

\-Speaking of carbs, she is so strange. She doesn’t eat low carb, she has us buy poptarts before every visit because she likes to eat them everyday and wants them on hand. But she has tried to teach my kids to not eat pie crust on homemade pies, and she shames us for giving our kids sweets for dessert, and popsicles. This woman has had multiple (what appear to be) anxiety attacks over us using store-bought popsicles instead of making our own. She gives me a hard time anytime I cook with the stand mixer, she brags about only mixing her food by hand, and implies that it’s not home made if a stand mixer does it.

\- All of us are healthy, no one is overweight, and even if we were it still would be out of line for her to do that. I’m just sharing that there is no rationale whatsoever for trying to restrict carbs or moderate treats for the kids. They have a good balance and we don’t want to be so restrictive they become obsessed with something because they can’t have it. So we allow almost anything but teach moderation.

\-What makes me think it is an eating disorder or anxiety is that often times she will show us her plate of food with food still on it, and out of nowhere spend a lot of time justifying why she ate what she ate, in a bragging tone of “look how little I ate! Be proud of me!” but no one cares. Many days she will do that for breakfast and lunch and then eat a huge dinner. Which isn’t a problem, it’s just concerning the way she talks about it and that she thinks she has to explain it to us why she is eating so little/so much.

The longest and most robust things she says to me are when she (unprompted) corners me to tell me about her food quantities. It’s the only time she’s not passive-aggressive or judgmental, and she seems to be seeking my approval. Almost every meal she tries to discuss why she ate the amount she ate, like it matters, and I do kind of feel bad for her that she thinks she is being judged or needs to tell us these things totally unprompted. She’s a fit lady, she can do whatever she wants, it just starts to urk me when she guilts us over what we eat or what the kids are eating because it’s hypocritical. I don’t want them to pick up her uncomfortable and inconsistent relationship with food. I always just tell her “it doesn’t matter to me what you eat, I just want you to be happy” and she doesn’t seem satisfied with that.

\-She arrives with lots of whole foods style treats and snacks and just places them around the house and in the pantry. Are they for her? Are they for us? No idea. She does this with gifts too, not a word about it just puts toys and clothes for the kids around the house on tables, the couch, and the countertop. Some things are choking hazards and we have toddlers. She will buy groceries and put them in the fridge, then never touch them the whole trip. I throw away so much food and it’s upsetting. My best guess is that she thinks if she puts it in the house she thinks she can feel good about “feeding us better food,” but a lot of it goes untouched because if we have a visitor coming, I am a host, I already have a house full of food and I have already checked with said visitor in advance and shopped for what the visitor requests (for her its coffee, creamer, and poptarts). It’s too much food, too much clutter, and she communicates zero expectations about what will happen with the food or clutter.

\-She refuses to use covered coffee cups, she reheats her coffee constantly and we have LITTLE kids so I am always worried about spills and burns. She does not care. I have considered removing all mugs prior to her visits, to force her to use covered cups. Now it’s not an issue because I don’t plan to let her back in the house. But her solution was to use the mugs she wants, leave them open, and place them on the shelves we have in the living room that are high up to display our treasured items from travels. Yep, she uses our nice display shelves with special treasures… as a cup holder. Like that’s appropriate houseguest behavior.

\-We were driving to the zoo, wanted to stop at the Panera drive through. Warned her that we weren’t going in, because it’s too much to get all the kids in and out of the car. She wanted a muffin and told me to pick which one, I told her to google their muffin choices because I don’t ever get muffins there and I don’t know what they have. She wouldn’t even pick up her phone. She kept just saying “any kind of muffin.” I told her she needed to make her own choice, she huffed and still refused to look it up, and said “fine, get me a chocolate chip cookie.” A cookie for breakfast ladies and gentlemen, in front of my kids who she thinks shouldn’t be allowed to have desserts at normal dessert time.

We got there, ordered, and then after we drove away she complained that I got a hot breakfast sandwich for myself.  She said to me “I thought we couldn’t order cooked food because you wanted to be fast and not go inside, I wanted a sandwich like you have.” I reminded her that no one said that at all, she said she wanted a cookie and so that’s what she got, and I ate my own damn sandwich.

\-There are so many more, but this is long enough. She regularly travels and visits other friends and family, I have no indication that she behaves this rudely around anyone else. I truly just think it’s around me, and I don’t think I will ever find out why, but boy do I have theories.",19,1758713722.0,JUSTNOMIL,4,1.0,False

1np9p20,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1np9p20,From 119kg to 99KG – 6 month update,"Hey everyone,
Wanted to share my progress over the past 6 months.

Since March, I’ve been regularly going to the gym and also playing badminton.
In the gym, I’ve been following a push–pull–legs split and a 30min incline walk post the workout. Badminton in the evening has kept me consistent with cardio.

On the diet side, I’ve mainly focused on high-protein meals, usually just 2 meals a day in a window of 5-6 hours. Pre-workout, I keep it light with black coffee and almonds.

For context, my all-time highest weight was 122 kgs. I’m currently at 99 kgs, and my goal is to lose another 15–20 kgs in the next 6–8 months.

Attaching both my body test reports (before & after) for comparison.
Would love to hear your thoughts on the changes and any suggestions to improve further.

We spend so much time looking backward - analyzing our mistakes, replaying our lowest moments, wondering ""what if"" about different choices we could have made. But what if we flipped that energy forward instead?

**Here's what I'm thinking:**

The person you were yesterday made the best decisions they could with the awareness they had at the time. That person brought you here. But the person you're becoming? That's someone entirely different.

**The person you're becoming:**

Has learned from experiences the old you couldn't even imagine

Carries wisdom earned through real struggle, not just theory

Understands their triggers and patterns in ways they never did before

Has tools and perspectives that took time and effort to develop

I'm not saying ignore the past or pretend mistakes didn't happen. But what if we started giving more energy to who we're growing into instead of who we used to be?

The thing is: Every single day, you get to choose which version of yourself shows up. The version that reacts from old patterns, or the version that responds from new awareness.

Some days you'll choose the old version - and that's human. But more and more, you'll find yourself naturally choosing the newer, wiser version. Not because you have to, but because that's genuinely who you're becoming.

So here's my question : What's one thing the ""new you"" does differently than the ""old you""? Maybe it's how you handle stress, how you treat yourself when you mess up, or how you show up in relationships.",1,1758713607.0,PornQuittersHub,0,1.0,False

(2025 Guide for Company Formation),"What Are the Working Hours and Leave Entitlements in Bahrain? (2025 Guide for Company Formation)\
\
Alt text: Business people engaged in a professional meeting, corporate professionals collaborating. most agile and accessible hub for company formation. According to recent data by Reuters (April 2025), non-oil economic growth reached 5.1% last year, outpacing several regional neighbors. The Forbes Business forecast identifies Bahrain as a “startup magnet” due to its liberal ownership rules, transparent regulatory environment, and the advantageous ‘Team Bahrain’ ecosystem championed by the EDB.\
\
Bahrain’s 2025 labor law updates have made company formation more attractive than ever, with streamlined processes and stronger protections for both employers and staff—especially those operating from free zones or the bustling Seef and Diplomatic Areas.\
\
Business districts like Bahrain Financial Harbour, Bahrain Bay, and Amwaj Islands pulse with activity. And unlike in the UAE or Saudi Arabia, procedures for company formation in Bahrain are faster, often less bureaucratic, and surprisingly friendly to foreign ownership—even up to 100% in most sectors (latest 2025 update).\
Working Hours According to Bahrain’s Labor Law\
Standard Working Hours\
The Bahrain Labor Law (Decree Law No. 36 of 2012, as amended through 2025) is clear:\
\
Standard working hours: 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week, excluding rest breaks\
Maximum allowable hours: Employers may not mandate employees to work more than 60 hours per week\
Overtime: Any work beyond the standard is payable at 125% of the regular wage (150% on Fridays/public holidays)\
\
\
Importantly, during the Holy Month of Ramadan, Muslim employees' daily working hours drop to 6 hours per day by law—something I’ve seen strictly enforced in the Seef District and even more so in government offices like the MOICT in the Diplomatic Area.\
\
Practical Workplace Examples\
\
\
In Bahrain Bay, many tech startups opt for a standard 9 am–5 pm schedule, with a relaxed lunch window to accommodate both prayer and tradition. Flexible working (especially remote or hybrid models) is increasingly common post-2024 tech-policy updates.\
\
\
Retail and hospitality sectors (think City Centre Bahrain and The Avenues) often adopt split shifts to maximize customer coverage while staying within the law.\
\
\
Rest Breaks and Working Week Norms\
\
Breaks: Employees must get at least 30 minutes’ rest after five consecutive hours of work.\
Rest Days: A minimum of one paid rest day per week is mandated, usually Friday in line with local customs.\
Shift Work: For companies operating 24/7 (such as hotels in Amwaj Islands), shift rotations must ensure no worker exceeds maximum weekly hours.\
\
\
Surprisingly, the recent 2025 regulatory update stipulates that flexible working arrangements—if agreed in writing—may permit compressed workweeks or adjusted hours, as long as weekly maxima are not exceeded.\
\
Types of Leave Entitlements in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, HR team explaining leave entitlements and benefits to employees.. If a public holiday falls on a Friday (the official rest day), it is typically granted on the next working day.\
Sick Leave\
Employees are entitled to 55 days of sick leave per year:\
\
First 15 days at full pay\
Next 20 days at half pay\
Final 20 days unpaid\
\
A certified medical report from a government-approved doctor is required—be sure to budget time for this, especially during flu season when the Salmaniya Medical Complex gets busy.\
Maternity and Paternity Leave\
\
Maternity leave: 75 days (inclusive of 60 paid, 15 unpaid) as per 2025 Labor Law update (effective February 2025)\
Paternity leave: 7 days paid, newly introduced in 2025 (previously 1 day only)\
\
(As a parent, I once scrambled to prepare payroll adjustments when a staff member’s child arrived two weeks early; lesson learned—always keep a backup signatory on file with the LMRA!)\
Emergency and Compassionate Leave\
\
Up to 3 days paid leave for the death of an immediate family member\
Special leave provisions exist for marriage, Hajj, and certain personal emergencies\
\
Special Observance: Ramadan Adjustments\
Ramadan brings unique business rhythm. Many companies (especially those in Seef District and Bahrain Bay) arrange shorter working hours for all, not just Muslim staff. Expect quieter afternoons and a flurry of activity before Iftar. If you’re filing with the Sijilat portal or Tamkeen, adjust your timelines—queues can be surprisingly short in the late mornings during Ramadan!\
Regulatory Updates and 2025 Changes\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, business professionals reviewing updated labor policy.\
* Minimum rest day enforcement: On-site MOICT inspections have doubled, especially in larger firms\
For a complete guide to compliance, the Bahrain Ministry of Labour and KeylinkBH’s compliance resource are invaluable.\
Navigating Company Formation: Ownership, Business Types, and Registration\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, diverse team meeting to plan business formation.). In restricted sectors, up to 99% foreign ownership is allowed (details), with local sponsorship only necessary for special cases (sponsorship FAQ).

Step-by-Step Process: Starting a Compliant Business in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, team working on business registration paperwork.\
2. Reserve your company name at Sijilat—early mornings, especially mid-week, are fastest (avoid Sundays!).\
3. Prepare core documents (Articles, MOA, ID proofs—scan and pre-upload for digital submission).\
4. Register via Sijilat (how-to steps)—use the Tamkeen support desk if you hit a snag.\
5. Obtain Commercial Registration (requirements).\
6. Complete LMRA labor registration, ensuring you input correct staff working schedules to avoid delays.\
7. Comply with ongoing obligations (bookkeeping tips); annual labor audits are now common, so keep your leave and time-keeping in order.\
8. Apply for incentives if eligible (free zone info).\
Pro tip: Want to avoid paperwork hold-ups? Use a business center in Diplomatic Area—their in-house PROs can fast-track your document stamping (I cut my registration time by three days this way).\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Labor Compliance\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, calculator and business finance paperwork on table., BHD 1,500–2,500 (premium, express, or with PRO services)\
* Office rent: BHD 150/month (virtual office, Seef), BHD 350–1,200/month (physical, Bahrain Bay, Financial Harbour)\
* Staff accommodation and labor registration: LMRA fees at BHD 72/year per expat, plus BHD 60–100 for visa processing\
* Social insurance: 12% (Bahraini staff), 3% (expat staff) of gross salary\
* Annual leave and sick leave costs: Should be factored into gross payroll for cash-flow planning\
For a detailed cost calculator, see KeylinkBH’s formation cost guide.\
Insider Budget Tips\
\
Avoid peak seasons for government fees (April/May and September/October are busiest—February or June are best for fast approvals and minimized queues).\
Bundle document attestations—using a single legal service provider saves both time and unnecessary travel between Diplomatic Area and Isa Town Notary.\
Negotiate leave accrual cycles in staff contracts—aligning leave year with calendar year simplifies payroll.\
\
Bahrain Business Culture: Unofficial Rhythms and Local Nuances\
\
During my first visit to the LMRA headquarters, I made the rookie error of queuing after noon on Thursday. By then, most staff were prepping for Friday prayers or winding down for the weekend. Now, I always schedule official visits early Sunday mornings: quieter, friendlier, and far less stressful!\
\
Bahraini business etiquette values face-to-face contact, personal rapport, and hospitality—expect coffee service and, when offered, always accept (even if you only take a sip). Majlis-style meetings, widespread in the Seef District and Bahrain Bay, build trust and open doors for smoother leave and HR negotiations.\
Common Mistakes and How to Prevent Them\
One of the most frequent errors I see from foreign founders? Relying on “standard GCC templates” for employment contracts. Bahrain’s recent labor code tweaks are unique: misaligning leave or overtime clauses can incur fines up to BHD 5,000 per infraction. Double-check contract templates with a recommended local provider (I trust KeylinkBH for up-to-date documents; their proactive legal alerts saved us from a costly compliance miss last year).\
And please, never overlook leave record-keeping. The Sijilat digital module now makes it easy, but only if you upload approvals and supporting documents. Skipping this step once cost me a surprise audit call—don’t repeat my mistake.\
Comparing with UAE and Saudi Arabia: Where Bahrain Excels\
Bahrain’s labor regime is markedly friendlier to startups and foreign investors than the UAE or Saudi Arabia as of 2025:\
\
No requirement for a local sponsor in most sectors\
Simpler leave and work-hour tracking systems (Sijilat, LMRA Dashboard)\
More relaxed approach to business attire and meeting customs—it’s acceptable (and even expected) to ‘talk shop’ over Arabic coffee and pastries\
\
Most importantly, Bahrain’s Ministry of Labour and Tamkeen actively encourage business formation and workforce upskilling, meaning you’ll find support for compliance at every stage.\

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
1. Can a foreign owner set working hours and leave policies independently?\
Yes, as long as the policies meet or exceed Bahrain Labour Law minimums (8 hours/day, 48 hours/week, 30 days leave). Full foreign ownership is allowed in most sectors (latest list), but check sectoral restrictions (ownership guide).\
2. What documents are needed for leave compliance?\
Maintain digital copies of:\
- Employment contracts\
- Approved leave forms (now available via Sijilat)\
- Medical certificates (for sick leave)\
- LMRA staff lists\
Using KeylinkBH’s bookkeeping service can automate most document retention.\
3. How do Ramadan working hours apply for non-Muslim staff?\
Officially, only Muslim employees must have hours reduced to 6 per day, but most firms extend shorter hours to all out of respect and practicality. (My advice: synchronize your business calendar accordingly—afternoon meetings rarely run long!)\
4. What’s the fastest way to process annual leave approvals?\
The newest Sijilat online leave approval system is fastest—documents can be uploaded, approved, and archived without physical handover. For urgent leave, use the Tamkeen helpline (I once resolved a last-minute payroll glitch in under an hour this way!).\
5. Are there free zones with special working hours or leave rules?\
Free zones (more on benefits) generally follow national labor law, but may allow more flexibility in specific employment contracts—especially for tech or logistics firms based out of Bahrain Logistics Zone or Bahrain Investment Wharf.\
For any sector-specific questions or real-time regulatory changes, regularly consult Bahrain.com and your local company formation advisor.\
\
And the best payoff? When you master these details, you’ll not only stay compliant—you’ll build a workplace culture in Bahrain that feels both global and distinctly local. I wouldn’t trade that view from Bahrain Bay, on a balmy Thursday, for any office corridor in Dubai or Riyadh.",1,1758713338.0,companysetupbh,1,1.0,False
1np9lyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1np9lyo/hello_the_silence_chapter_2/,"Hello? ""The Silence."" Chapter 2.","Chapter 2: Arrival at the Station

I woke up the next morning early to get cleaned up and get some coffee into my system before heading to meet Ranger Richardson. I brushed my teeth, took a quick shower to kickstart my energy, and got dressed. Once ready, I packed away my things into the car and then cleaned up my mess, I ensured everything was back in the car, and drove to the station. 

I pulled in about five minutes before 8 a.m. and was greeted by a gate guard who looked as awake as a dead fish. I rolled down my window, and he started his routine.
“Hi, I’m Ranger Jonah Reese with the Pisgah National Park Rangers. I need to see an I.D. and know your reason for being here.”

He said it all while barely holding his head up, eyes half-open. I handed him my I.D. and replied. “Yeah, I’m the new hire for one of the lookout cabins. I was told to meet with Ranger Richardson for baggage check and paperwork.”

He looked confused but checked my I.D., handed it back, and said. “Oh, okay. Go ahead and park in Zone 4. Good luck out there. Once you’re through the gate to the cabin lands, don’t forget to say ‘Hello’ out there.”

Before I could respond, he retreated into his guard hut and shut the door.
“Hmm, okay? That’s a bit weird,” I thought, but I decided not to dwell on it. What did he mean by ‘through the gate’? Was there something different about the land out there?

I did as he said and parked in Zone 4, found spot 7 was open. Whipped my car in the spit and stopped. I grabbed what I needed out of the car and locked it up, then headed toward the station.

 The ranger station sat within a Tall, sturdy chain-link fence, its main gate wide open, with birds chirping and leaves rustling in the breeze, with a lively, normal hum of the woods. Beyond the fence, though a second gate had could see, a sign above marked ‘Cabin 12 Access,’ leading to the trail. It was closed, and the woods beyond it looked… quieter, somehow, though I couldn’t place why. Jonah’s words echoed in my head: ‘Say Hello out there.’ Why out there specifically? Was it just a quirky tradition, or was there something about that fenced-off area that made it matter? I shook off the thought, figuring I’d find out soon enough.

I approached the main door and wiggled the knob and noticed it was unlocked, and assuming they expected me, I didn’t knock, I just walked in. 
“Hello? New hire, I'm here for—”
Before I could finish, a guy with undone pants, no shirt, and no shoes, looking half-asleep, screamed. “Hey, didn’t your momma teach you how to knock!”
Now fully awake, he glared at me. I screamed back. “Oh my god, I’m so sorry!”
I slammed the door behind me and stepped away, trying to compose myself from the awkward first impression.

After a couple of minutes, the same guy came out fully dressed except for his shoes, which he carried in one hand along with a coffee in the other. Wanting to apologize without making it more embarrassing, I said.
“Hey, I’m sorry for barging in. I thought it was just an office or welcome area. Didn’t expect anyone to be… like that.”

He sat at a picnic table outside the station, he lit a cigarette, took a drag, and gave me a groggy, unamused stare. “Knock before you enter, anywhere. I’m at least glad you made sure to say ‘Hello’ and started explaining yourself. If not for that, I probably would’ve come at you, and lord knows how that would’ve gone. No offense, just think next time. I also haven’t introduced myself yet. I’m Ranger Josh Richardson, second in command here at Outpost Chance of the Pisgah National Park. Pleased to meet you, uh…?”

“Oh, I’m Alex. Pleased to meet you, Josh. You’re the Ranger Richardson I’m supposed to meet?”
He finished lacing his boots, put out his first cig and took another sip of coffee. “No, that’ll be my father, John ‘Rich’ Richardson. He was on the phone with the head of Outpost Glory, our neighbor station. he was talking about a fire in the next county over.”

He took another sip, then lit another cigarette. “He’ll be off soon. It’s a fire we shouldn’t have to handle, but we need the heads-up just in case.”
Taking a drag while eyeing me up and down, he asked, “What made you wanna come out here? Why this job?”

I was confused. I’m a bit on the smaller side, but I didn’t look like some city slicker playing country. 
“I grew up around woods my whole life and needed time away from normal life, you know? The pay didn’t hurt either, so I figured why not. Why do you ask?”

He stared at the ground, took a drag, finished his coffee, and said, 
“Just didn’t seem the type. No offense. Just stick to the rules out there, especially once you’re past the gate. That ‘Hello’ thing? Don’t skip it. Last guy who did… let’s just say he didn’t stick around long.” He smirked, but his eyes flicked nervously toward the closed gate leading to the cabin trail.

I frowned, waiting for more, but he clammed up. Why was everyone so fixated on saying ‘Hello’? And why only past the gate? Was it some kind of signal, or was there something out there in that 20-mile stretch that needed to hear it? The way Josh’s voice tightened made it sound like more than a joke, and it left a knot in my stomach.

I flashed a fake smile and nodded. 
""None taken. I get that a lot. But discs can handle myself out here, or at least we’ll see.”

He looked at me like I was the most naive kid he’d ever met. “Yeah. We’ll see, bud.”

After a few minutes of small talk with Josh, Ranger Richardson came out the door. A tall, authoritative figure with a clean cowboy hat. He looked at Josh and said, 
""Jesus, boy, could you have kept it down earlier? You Interrupted my call with Leigh! But anyhow, who might you be, young man?”

Did anyone know I was coming? I guess they must’ve forgotten. But Josh answered before I could. “This little turd is the reason I screamed. This is the new hire for Cabin 12, name is Alex. The reason for my scream is he didn’t knock and just decided to come right inside. So thanks for mentioning he was coming, there Pops.”

Ranger Richardson gave Josh a classic dad glare. “Ah yes. Well Josh, I wasn’t expecting to be on the phone for as long as I was, and I wasn’t expecting you up before he got here. So hush your lip up. Need I remind you that you’re only here because of me and can leave because of me.”

Then he turned to me with a warm smile. “Sorry for the confusion and misunderstanding, work never stops. Leigh, The head of Outpost Glory in the County to our west, spotted a small wildfire starting about two miles from our lines. It should be handled by their teams, but we still needed to be notified in case it came our way. I realize I haven’t introduced myself yet. I’m Ranger Johnathan Richardson, the head of Outpost Chance. Pleased to meet you, Alex.” He extended his hand, and I shook it, nearly crushing mine. This man had calluses from a lifetime in the woods, no soft hands here. 

He released my hand, waved me to follow, and said, “Come inside, let’s get coffee and go over some things. Mind if Josh checks your things for contraband and unloads them from your car while we talk?” “Yeah, that’s fine. Everything’s in the trunk; anything in the back seats or front can stay. Here’s the key.”

I handed the key to Josh and then followed Ranger Richardson. He looked at Josh and said, “Be careful with his stuff, boy, and load it on the cart properly, weight in the front, got it? No judging his things.”

Josh shot back, “If I find a dildo or anything like that, I’m making a joke about it.”
I looked at Josh and quipped, “I have a count on them all, so I’ll know if one’s missing.”

Ranger Richardson laughed as we walked in. He poured me coffee, and we sat to discuss the job and safety. We talked for over an hour about routines, patrol routes, supplies, bi-weekly food drops (with requests allowed), and equipment at the cabin.
“The radio is your most important tool,” he said, holding out a military-style handheld with a long antenna, strap, and contact list. “Multiple batteries, a rechargeable one with charger. if you lose it, you can’t reach us if you’re hurt or lost. Keep it on you. There’s a computer for typing daily reports, sending them to headquarters, and messaging other outposts. A few old games on it for boredom. Flashlights, matches, lighters, cooking gear, everything else is there. Any Questions?”

Knowing I had my essentials and they’d provide food and water, but I could think of one. “Is there anything for protection at the cabin? A knife? Even a can bear spray?”

He chuckled. “Yes, there'll be a survival knife, our main issued tool. Then there’ll be an Axe and a Machete, used for clearing trails in the Area. Then the last resort, a pump-action 12 gauge in a safe with enough shells for three or four bears. The code is kept here at the station and is only given out in case of emergencies. So you'll need to get ahold of us here for to get in. But you have options. Use them as needed. Any other questions?”

Only one more: “What’s so important about saying ‘Hello’? Both Jonah and Josh mentioned it.”
Before I finished, he slammed his hand on the table and stared me down. 
“Just do it. No matter what. Whenever you enter somewhere, always say ‘Hello.’ Just do it and don’t forget.” He narrowed his eyes, stern. “Do I make myself clear, son?”

Of all the time so far, ive kept a cool head. But I would be lying if I said he didn't scare me, I probably showed some nervousness, maybe even fear. but I replied, “Yes, sir. Crystal clear. Understood.” 
He softened, smiling warmly. “Good. Now let’s check on Josh with your bag check and get you on your way. Long walk ahead.”

After we walk outside, we see Josh was finishing my last bag inspection and loading a pull-behind cart with my things. Ranger Richardson whispered to me, “Watch this,” then asked Josh. 
""Boy, you done inspecting and loading his stuff? Or do I need to kick your ass a bit to speed things up?”

They both laughed. Josh said, “Yeah, the cart’s loaded and good to go. And Everything he brought has approved, I found nothing questionable.”

Ranger Richardson chuckled. “Good. Now go get to work on something else; I’ll send him off.” Josh said his byes for now to me and then headed back inside. 

Ranger Richardson handed me a map and compass, explaining the route: “You’ll head out through the Cabin 12 gate here. From there, follow this trail to a fork not far out, take a left, then go about seven miles. You'll pass some field, open wooded areas and when You pass a creek with a small bridge. Once you’ve reached there, you’re almost home. If you get lost, Radio in if needed. Report anything of interest or concern. Understood?” 
I nodded, took the items, and prepped for my hike. “Thank you for the intro and advice, Ranger Richardson.”

His face hardened briefly, then smirked. “That’s Rich, son. No need to be too formal with me."" 

“Yes, sir, Mr. Rich. Sorry, I can’t shake my manners.”
He shook my hand, nodded. “All good. Good luck out there. And remember, past that gate, don’t forget to say ‘Hello’ out there.” 

Still unsure and worried for what will happen if I don't, I agreed and said. 
“Yes, sir. I'll do my best."" 

We parted ways, and I headed toward the Cabin 12 gate to start my year-long adventure and new life for a time. or that's what I thought, for the adventure i had been day dreaming about, turned into a life altering nightmare.

[Sage Barista Express]","I just bought a brand new Sage Barista Express, because my sister has one and I love it. For some context, hers is set to '2' on the Fine - Course dial (so pretty fine grind), and she has the grind amount at around 2 o clock. So much closer to Less than More. Every time I use her machine, I use the 'auto' setting to get my grind amount, I tamp as normal, I put it in and hit a double shot and it pours out perfectly as you'd expect.

I've done the exact same setting on my out the box machine, using the auto, tamping it etc and it leaves a small gap between the coffee and the top of the portafilter basket, and I get maybe a spit of espresso out of it. I mean a tiny drop, literally nothing. It sits there making noise and nothing is coming out, and then eventually a droplet will come out of one side of the portafilter basket, not both. So it's not evenly coming out, but tbh it's not even coming out in the first place. The pressure gauge doesn't really get past 11-12 o clock, but is still in the 'espresso range'. And the puck in the portafilter comes out with a layer of water on it when it finishes.

I've attached some images to give you a better idea, but i'm seriously on the verge of returning this thing. I've tried multiple different grind amounts, grind courseness, tamping firmer, tamping gently, it's making literally no difference. I'm having to hit the double shot like three times to get any coffee into the cup. 

I'm hoping it's a simple setting or config I'm messing up, but I really don't know. Any advice or tips would be great.

Is this now platonic or something more?,"I (25M) haven’t talked to this guy, Dan (25M), in a year and a half. I was in a situationship with him around Jan 2024 to maybe May 2024 before we lost touch. I’m not sure how close he’d consider us, but we went out about a dozen times, either for lunches during work days, or dinner before sex. We usually also spent the entire day together after fucking — he’d make me a meal or we’d go out to eat, work out, lay in the park, etc. He even took the train from DC to Baltimore for an evening/night when I was on a work trip there. We never hung around his friends or mine.

Three weeks ago, I hit him up to reconnect because someone brought him up in conversation. I asked if he wanted to cuddle and he said he couldn’t because he had a boyfriend and they were still “figuring it out,” but wanted to take me out to drinks or coffee. We spent two and a half hours together over drinks two weeks ago that Thursday, and when I told him over drinks that I was going home decor shopping, he suggested we go to an estate sale that Saturday. He also suggested we do other things like go to a rock climbing gym near where I live, because he had two guest passes. 

That Saturday, we spent the entire day together from 10:30-5pm, later working out together and eating lunch and going to a bookstore. After our workout he got completely naked in front of me (probably inches away from my face), which I found a little jarring considering he had a boyfriend. And after that day together he suggested we grab drinks the following week to chat about my new job. (He said he had to take a rain check because of work and we rescheduled to this Thursday.) 

What boggles my mind is that’s what we did during our situationship, just without the sex. The same bookstore. The same cafe for lunch. He always spends a lot of time with me the day after sex. He always has 20 plans he thinks we should do together — always one on one. He even insisted on paying for drinks and bought the food for lunch, as he always had done with me.

We maybe went out at most a dozen times before we lost touch. And when we did, we maybe said stuff like “we should get together again” twice or three times. And for what it’s worth, he told me over lunch that Saturday that he was dating another guy since March. He also talked about his boyfriend a decent amount, about half the time when I brought him up. But in June, even after we hadn’t chatted much, he randomly sent a shirtless selfie to me on snapchat. Not sure if they were exclusive then.

We didn’t end things last year on a bad note. He was a great guy but I was too focused on getting my career off the ground. My entire life was work and I barely had room for friends nevertheless a bf. I’ve gotten that mostly sorted out now, and am ready to date around. I would’ve asked him out a few weeks ago if he was single. 

But I can’t tell if he’s still interested in me like that. My friends (mostly straight) all say they get a weird vibe that’s not purely platonic but I’m not sure about this either way. On one hand he drew a clear boundary — no intimate contact like cuddling. On another, he suggested we spend the day together. Why spend all this time with an old situationship after a year and a half of minimal contact? I wouldn’t have considered us super close friends for what it’s worth, considering we only saw each other around a dozen times.

So, can we just take a moment to talk about how we’re all feeling a little *stiff* these days? 😩 Whether it’s from sitting at a desk, binge-watching our favorite shows, or being a couch potato on the weekends, our backs are starting to send us some *very* clear messages. 

I realized this the other morning when I woke up feeling like I’d been hit by a truck. I mean, how is it that getting out of bed can feel like an Olympic sport? 😂 After some frantic googling and a Pinterest rabbit hole about “quick morning stretches,” I decided to give it a shot instead of immediately booking an appointment with the chiropractor. Why spend a small fortune when I could stretch my way into a better day, right? 

Here’s what I found out, and honestly, my back says THANK YOU:

**My Top Simple Morning Stretches:**

1. **Cat-Cow Stretch:** A little meow and moo to wake up those vertebrates! 🐱🐮 Feels like a little dance party for your spine. 

2. **Child’s Pose:** This one feels like a hug. Who doesn’t want a warm embrace from the universe first thing in the morning? 🌌

3. **Seated Forward Bend:** You sit, you bend, and suddenly you feel like you just left the chiropractor’s office... for free!

4. **Torso Twist:** A little twist goes a long way, and it's so good for that tight lower back. Just don’t overdo it and accidentally spin your chair around at work later. 🤭

And let’s be real: stretching in the morning doesn’t just help with physical stiffness. There’s something *really* uplifting about taking a moment for yourself before diving into the chaos of the day. 🤗 

Plus, the best part? I don’t have to make awkward small talk with a chiropractor about how often I skip the gym when I’m busy. 😅 

Sure, sometimes we need a professional touch, and I totally believe in strong people and their skills, but why pay for something that a few minutes of stretching could solve? Plus, my wallet feels better too. Just think about it:  

- **$150+ for a chiropractor visit vs. 15 minutes of stretches?** I think I’ll choose the stretches, thank you very much!

So, if you’re feeling stiff and sore, give these stretches a go. Maybe put on some chill music while you do it, drink a little coffee, and breathe deep. You’ll be surprised how much better you feel before you even start your day. 

What are some of your favorite stretches, or do you also have a chiropractor horror story? I’d love to hear how you start your mornings! Let’s swap tips. The more we share, the stronger we get! ✨

1np9c7x,https://i.redd.it/ke8krxc7h3rf1.jpeg,Coffee Spots of Nagpur 2: Aromas,"Nagpur has too many coffee spots – I’m reviewing them one by one.  
This week’s stop: ***Aromas Bistro***, Pratap Nagar

  
⸻

☕️ Coffee I tried:

* Iced V60 pour over (Light Roasted Rum-flavored beans) – 9/10  (surprisingly good)
* VB’s Special Cold Brew – 9.5/10
* Mocha Frappe (No whipped cream) – 9/10

⸻

Here’s my take:  
Last week we did Lush House, which set a solid benchmark for consistency. Aromas, though, feels like it’s pushing things up a notch, and it’s starting to shape the scale I will eventually post at the end of this series.

“*I have measured out my life with coffee spoons*.” *– T.S. Eliot*

Aromas Bistro is still relatively under the radar in Nagpur, and honestly, I didn’t expect it to be this good. The coffee quality was excellent across the board, and unlike a lot of places, it actually feels like value for money.

The ambience is comfortable, with a recommended group size of 2-6. There’s also a balcony where smoking is allowed. They only serve vegetarian food but also have beer on the menu, which makes it a bit of a hybrid space you can grab a cold brew or a cold one depending on your mood.

One standout from their drinks menu was the Yuzu IPA. It had a crisp, citrusy edge that immediately took me back to my time in the Yorkshire greenlands

The staff is really friendly, service is smooth, and you don’t get rushed out, you can sit there as long as you want. I walked in without expecting much but walked out thinking this is going to become one of my regular spots.

My close friends Aaron(M26) and Paul(M28) (Names changed for privacy) have been together for like 7 years, since I met them really. And Aaron recently asked me about my sex life with my husband, I asked why and he said he and Paul are having issues. 

The crux of it is that Aaron is a big guy and self conscious about sex and Paul is sort of slim and stoic. They a stereotypical bear/twink couple I guess.

Aaron said that he and Paul had been not having sex lately and for some time Aaron thought it was just a normal dry spell for them. For Paul it wasnt though and he said he wasn't feeling satisfied. I said to Aaron is it better to talk to a therapist? Because I'm not exactly sure what they should do. Apparently that's not an option because Paul refuses to do couples counselling. 

Aaron asked why Paul didn't just initiate when he wanted sex and Paul's answer was because he doesn't want Aaron to feel bad afterwards and that is can be difficult to have sex with someone who has sexual insecurities. Aaron says he can be upset after sex because of his body and has issues communicating what he wants to do in bed because he's scared Paul doesn't like to give because Aaron is usually the giver but would prefer to take as well. But Paul gets nothing out of giving and tends to not do that even though he said to Aaron that he doesn't mind doing it for him. So Aaron hates feeling like he has to ask and would prefer that Paul just take initiative but also feels bad that Paul isn't into it and wants Paul to like it. Paul said that would never be the case.

Like this screams therapy to me. But Paul said over coffee the other day that Aaron is overthinking it all and is dealing with low testosterone levels these past years. Paul thinks that Aaron just isn't interested or passionate about sex anymore and feels like Aaron is just constantly getting caught up in overthinking about it and then overwhelming himself. They both love eachother a lot and by just being around them you couldn't tell that they had any kind of relationship issues at all because they are like a perfect couple from the outside. 

So Aaron has low self esteem, low sex drive, and wants to have sex with Paul in a way that Paul is in control and is giving but finds it hard to get over the self consciousness and the vulnerability of it all. 

Paul isn't very expressive and so isn't taking control, has a usual sex drive, but doesn't get anything out of giving (but is happy to give when asked) and feels that sex with Aaron is an emotional minefield. 

What advice can I give them both that could help them sort this issue out? The last couple of times they tried had ended in tears and them not talking but Paul said there's no need for a therapist. 
So what do I tell them both? I've never thought this would ever be an issue for them.",1,1758712420.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

As someone who spends an embarrassing amount of hours gaming and another hefty chunk of time typing out work-related stuff, finding a keyboard that balances performance and comfort is a big deal. The ACE 60 PRO promises rapid actuation, customization options galore, and flashy RGB to boot. Let’s dive into the good, the bad, and the downright interesting about this wired gaming keyboard.

**Compact Design with a Gamer’s Twist**

This keyboard’s 60% layout is perfect for those who, like me, are perpetually short on desk real estate. I’ve got my mouse, headphones, monitor, and about five coffee cups vying for space, so having a sleek, minimalistic keyboard like this on the desk is a breath of fresh air. What impressed me right off the bat was the sound-dampening foam underneath. Every keystroke feels satisfying but without the clatter that could wake up the entire house during a late-night gaming session. That said, if you’re not used to smaller layouts, there’s an adjustment period. It took me a minute (literally) to stop hitting the wrong keys, but I could see myself fully recommending it to anyone who doesn’t need a numpad for work.

**Performance That Packs a Punch**

Here comes the juicy bit. The ACE 60 PRO boasts professional-grade features like its Uranus magnetic switches that are, frankly, a game-changer. Adjustable actuation points sound gimmicky until you use them. I was able to tweak the actuation anywhere between 0.1 and 3.4mm, which gave me immense control depending on whether I was frantically double-tapping during a boss fight or typing out an email to a coworker. The Rapid Trigger feature practically hurled me into action the moment my fingers even glanced at the keys. And yes, that 8kHz polling rate is absurdly responsive. I tested it out during a few competitive matches, and while it didn’t suddenly make me pro-tier, it made inputs feel ultra-smooth compared to your average keyboard.

**[Check Mchose ACE 60 PRO price on Amazon.](https://headphonegeek.com/p/b0f1fnwgqt/)**

**A Symphony of RGB Lights**

You can’t have a proper gaming keyboard without RGB lighting, and the Ace 60 PRO does not disappoint. The 22 lighting effects shine brightly through the PBT keycaps, which, by the way, are oil-resistant and brilliantly durable. I’m a sucker for customizability, so spending a couple of hours tinkering with the Mchose driver to make my keyboard look like a rotating carnival was oddly satisfying. There are up to 16 million color possibilities, though I stopped testing after about 50 because my eyes needed a break. 

**Highs and Lows: Pros of the ACE 60 Pro**

- **Customizable Actuation:** Perfect for gamers who like to fine-tune every millimeter.  
- **Quiet Comfort:** Quiet typing experience without compromising on key feedback.  
- **Durable Build Quality:** Those PBT keycaps and aluminum alloy plate are built to last.  
- **RGB Fans Unite:** Lighting options are plentiful and easy to set up.  

**Hurdles You Might Face**

- **Steep Learning Curve:** If you’re transitioning from a full-sized keyboard, particularly for work, the compact design will take some getting used to.  
- **Limited Mac Support:** The keyboard’s software customization options are more Windows-friendly, so Mac users might not feel fully catered to.  
- **Price Tag vs. Features:** Some competitors offer similar specs at a slightly more accessible price—something to keep in mind.  

**Competitive Options in the Market**

Speaking of competitors, it’s worth highlighting how the ACE 60 PRO stands against other compact gaming keyboards like the Anne Pro 2 and the SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini. Compared to the Anne Pro 2, the tactile response and advanced actuation on the ACE 60 PRO easily outshine its rival. However, the Anne Pro 2 might lure some users with its wireless capability, which the ACE 60 lacks.

The SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini, on the other hand, is a formidable contender thanks to its similarly customizable actuation and overall build quality. But pricing tilts in favor of the ACE 60 PRO, especially given its magnetic switch technology.

**Value for Money**

Evaluating the ACE 60 PRO against its price was an interesting exercise. This isn’t a budget purchase, let’s be clear. However, anyone seeking a keyboard that can adapt to both leisurely typing and hardcore gaming sessions might find the cost well-justified. The blend of durability (thank you, PBT keycaps) and high performance (Rapid Trigger and 8kHz polling) might tip the scales for gamers who want a distinct edge. For others, it might feel like paying for flexibility they didn’t ask to have.

And well, here's what I found. Surprisingly, we've got a pretty solid starting point with our Al Roadmap, which covers digitisation, R&D, workforce development, and regulation. Add to that the Innovation Act, Startup Act, and the Digital Workforce Competitiveness Act these show we're not just talking about Al, we're actually trying to prepare the country for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Plus, with the Philippines signing on to things like the UNESCO Al Ethics Recommendation and the Bletchly Declaration, it's clear we want to keep up with global standards while keeping human rights and ethics at the heart of Al adoption.
But here's the kicker hahaah!! EXECUTION is still the gap.
Infrastructure and internet access? Uneven. Education and reskilling? They exist but aren't moving fast enough to keep pace with industry demand. And until we pass a dedicated Al law, there are still gray areas around accountability, ethics, and liability especially in high-risk sectors. The BPO industry, one of our economic lifelines, could also be shaken hard by automation.
Without transition plans in place, a lot of jobs could be lost before new ones are created.
Now imagine if Gensan coffee shops (yes, including ourzz!) can already run on drive-thru timers, digital POS, and even Al-driven customer insights, what more can we do if the whole country invests in better infrastructure and digital training? The Philippines has the chance not just to adopt Al but to lead in responsible and ethical Al in the region. The key is execution building infrastructure that works, reskilling our people, and putting frameworks in place that let innovation thrive while still protecting communities. Who knows, maybe the same way Gensan became a hub for tuna and coffee, we could also become a hub for ethical Al in Southeast Asia.

I’m here because I honestly don’t know what else to do. I lost someone I truly loved, and I haven’t been able to move on for three years. I’m hoping that maybe, just maybe, this post reaches her—or that someone out there can help me make sense of everything.

When I was 19, I met this girl on Facebook. But I had actually seen her two years earlier when I visited my brother’s school. She was a student there—quiet, reserved, and something about her just stuck with me. I looked for her for two years until I finally found her online. We connected and started dating.

She was amazing—deeply understanding, especially when it came to emotional support. She stood by me when my grandmother was critically ill, and I stood by her when she lost her grandfather. We supported each other in ways that made me feel like we were meant to be.

When the pandemic hit, we ended up in a long-distance relationship. We talked daily and bonded over games like Clash of Clans on Discord. But as time passed, I found myself craving more than emotional closeness—I was looking for physical affection too. I brought it up, hoping we could talk it through. But she was very old-school in her views. She didn’t want to go down that road, and after that conversation, things felt different.

Then came the moment that changed everything.

One of the girls from our Discord server confessed her feelings for me. I didn’t reciprocate or act on it—but I also didn’t shut it down immediately. I posted her message on my Instagram story. Dumb move, I know—but I didn’t cheat. The most that ever happened was a coffee meet-up, nothing more.

She saw the story.

That same day, she blocked me—everywhere. I panicked. I called her over 20 times. I tried to reach out through mutual friends, only to find out she had blocked them too. It was like I never existed.

And now, it’s been three years.

I’ve tried so hard to get through to her, to explain, to just talk. But every time I think I’m close, she shuts me out again. And I can’t lie—I still love her. I know I messed up, and I would give anything to go back and handle it differently. I’m not here to beg or force anything. I just want her to know the truth, and that I never stopped caring.

She used to watch Charlotte Dobre’s channel, so I’m posting here with the small hope that maybe, somehow, this will reach her.

**Please come back, Ritu.**

**TL;DR**: Met the girl I loved when I was 19. We dated during lockdown and supported each other through some of life’s hardest moments. I asked for more physical affection, which she wasn’t comfortable with. When another girl confessed her feelings to me, I posted it as a story—not to hurt anyone. She saw it and blocked me the same day. It’s been 3 years, and I still can’t let her go.

We've had our share of ups and downs over the past 20+ years and our relationship is solid. A lot of stressful life events have hit one after another for the past two years, that is emotionally exhausting and mostly lame on my shoulders because I'm a stray at home mom/wife. But we've been having some serious communication issues lately and intimacy issues.  I want sex literally every day and he is fine with once a week or less and almost always initiated by me. This has become such a sensitive issue to talk about because he doesn't think he's doing anything wrong and it turns into a fight almost every time i being it up. His excuses or the reason he turns me down every night are, he's ""tired"", ""has a headache"", ""his back hurts"", etc. He says ""sex seems the only thing that keeps you sane lately"", etc. Or ""we just had sex 2 days ago, that's not enough for you?"" One Saturday morning, kids still sleeping, rare opportunity, and I was trying HARD. We were having coffee and I was hinting harder, literally rubbing him down there and he must have had a ingrown hair that i bumped and he jjumped. I apologized and then continued, just avoiding that spot and then I said ""you could just take your shorts off so I can see where not to touch"" and then smiled. He jumped up out of bed and angrily said, ""I'm obviously not getting out of this, am I?"" I was so surprised and so emotionally hurt that I just got out of bed, grabbed clothes and headed for the shower and he said, ""really, now you're going to walk away?"" I didn't even know how to feel or what to think. Most of our relationship, I've had to beat him off of me with a stick (figuratively not physically) because he wanted me ALL the time. He would get hard just hugging me. It was so nice. And now, it's like pulling teeth. We have the most amazing sex. It's always different. I'm pretty kinky and open to almost anything so it's NEVER boring. I'm 5'8 all natural. Brown hair, brown eyes, beautiful (according to every person I've ever met) slim, 41yrs old and people tell me I haven't changed looks since I was 20. No gray hair, no sagging, very clean, etc. It's not like I've let myself go or anything so it's not a physical thing because I'm not kidding when I say I look the same as I did basically when I met him. He says I'm hotter now and get hotter as I age. Our kids tell me i age like fine wine, lol. But it doesn't stop me from asking myself what I need to do to get him to notice me. It doesn't help me from thinking it's something I'm doing wrong. I cook, I clean, take care of our boys, take care of just about everything, try to keep his life as stress free as possible. 
He's literally always been the perfect husband. I have not always been the perfect wife. I got addicted to pain pills after multiple surgeries about 15 years ago. Friday I will clean for 10 years. Those were some rough times. He was always very patient with me. He has always treated me as his lil princess, even called me princess. Has always gone out of his way to put me up on a pedestal, even when i shouldn't have been. I've always been forever grateful to him for staying with me and supporting me throughout all those rough times. Ten years has been really good. Through counseling and communication and lots of patience and understanding, we've beat just about everything thrown at us. But for about a year now, I have felt so disconnected from him. He doesn't see it. He gets angry quickly. He HATES his job and is in the middle of switching his lifetime career away from the family business his grandfather started to a job that's going to take him 2hrs from home a couple days a week at least. I know that stress can change a person but.... this feels different. I know this man would NEVER cheat on me, that's never been a question. I know that's where a lot of people's minds go but it's not that. I'm not just being naive when I say that. He's always been a family man.  Doesn't go out, unless it's with me. He doesn't go hang with friends unless it's with me. He goes to work and comes home. His job is physically, mentally and emotionally demanding, etc and I know he's getting older and slowing down and maybe that's all this is 🤷🏻‍♀️ Maybe I'm reading too much into this but for about a year, I feel like the closer I try to get to him, the more he pulls away. He doesn't do the same things to try to make me smile. He doesn't do the small things anymore or goof around with me. He doesn't laugh at my silly antics anymore. There was a time where he would have done ANYTHING to make me smile/happy and now he barely puts any effort into ""us"". 
We have slept with a bunch of people together, like swingers, and it seems that's the only time he gets excited about having sex, is when it's with other people. Normally it's a guy we pick for me. Sometimes a couple men. Sometimes it's a mffm. This last time was like a relationship with a woman that we were both waaay into and she walked away because life got in the way and it was devastating to us. She was a good friend of ours before the ""relationship"" started. We had soooo much fun. We both loved it as much as the other. But it's over. It lasted about 6 months from start to finish. Friends for 3-4yrs. He wanted to have sex every time she did. But if I approached him alone, I got the excuses. He says it's unrelated. I've been believing him. He gets so angry if I elude to anything other than what he says it is. He tells me I read too much into him not being into at the times when he's not.

I'm currently working on a research project where I need to feed a large amount of industry material into an AI model (something like Google's NotebookLM) to build a custom knowledge base.

Here's the problem: I need to collect hundreds of webpages, reports, and articles from the internet, but these AI tools only really work well with PDF format.

# My current manual workflow is a total disaster:

1. Open a webpage.
2. Manually hit `Ctrl+P` and select ""Save as PDF"".
3. Struggle with the print settings to remove all the ads, navigation bars, and sidebars, otherwise the formatting is a complete mess.
4. Manually copy the title, paste it to rename the file, and then upload it to the cloud.

I'm about to lose my mind after doing this just a few dozen times. It's incredibly inefficient, the quality of the converted PDFs is inconsistent, and a lot of dynamically loaded content often gets lost.

https://preview.redd.it/nd51mnchg3rf1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=835a527b6f298389eb1d6ecd469e56059ab018de

To solve this, I've tried a bunch of online converters and various browser extensions, and honestly, it's been even more frustrating:

* **One extension** claims one-click saving, but the saved PDF has a long, meaningless string of random characters as a filename. I have to open each one manually just to copy the title and rename it, which defeats the whole purpose.
* **Another one** gets the filename right, but a single webpage PDF is often tens or even hundreds of megabytes. I'm guessing it paginates everything like an A4 document, and the file size balloons with each new page. Totally unusable.
* **And then there's one** that creates reasonably sized files with good names, but the user interface is ridiculously complex. From the first click, to selecting a mode, then adjusting options, then choosing a save location... it takes seven or eight clicks just to save one file. It's actually slower than doing it manually.

So, I'm genuinely looking for a ""holy grail"" tool that meets 

# these simple criteria:

1. **Simple to use:** The fewer clicks, the better. A one-click solution would be ideal, since I have so much content to save.
2. **Small file size:** The saved files need to be as small as possible. Storage space in the AI knowledge base is precious.
3. **Smart naming:** The filename needs to be meaningful (e.g., automatically using the webpage title) so I can easily find files later.

Can anyone here recommend a tool that perfectly solves these pain points? I'm open to anything, free or paid, as long as it works well!

We’re both early 20s. I felt it went well and I enjoyed her company, she was quite low key but was asking questions and was generally easy going. 

At the end of the date, before I had the chance to, she hugged me and asked me to let her know when I’m free to do something else. This sounds good, but I think it’s where I messed up. 

Basically, we matched almost 2 weeks ago and she wasn’t cold over text but she didn’t ask much and I was having to lead the conversation. When we had a first date set, it was for a week later, and conversation slowed to a couple exchanges a day (which felt a little dry to me). 

2 days before the date I sent a check in text in the evening, and she still hadn’t opened it 20 hrs later (this sort of thing had been happening for a few days). By then I honestly felt she wasn’t interested any more, and I’ve had some similar experiences like that in the past, so I removed her insta and messaged (politely) saying I assumed it was off but not to worry.

That’s when she responded quickly apologising for being busy at work and that she still wanted the date. 

So, after the date finished and she’d shown interest, I brought it up lightly so that I could clear the air and re add her (I didn’t want her clicking my insta a few days later and being confused that she didn’t follow me). She seemed fine and said she understood / would have done the same, and I re added her after saying goodbye.

But that was a full day ago and she hasn’t re added me, or responded to my post date message I sent last night, just telling her when I’m free and that the date as fun.

I know she might just be a slow texter but I’m worried I soured a positive interaction by bringing it up. Am I just over thinking it?

1np931s,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1np931s/pharmaceutics_ii_pharmacy_technician_download/,Pharmaceutics II (Pharmacy Technician) Download Free PDF – Punjab Pharmacy Council Textbooks,"Hey everyone! I just wanted to share some thoughts on a book I recently finished, and also chat a bit about getting into reading, especially if you're new to it or looking to shake things up. You know, sometimes the journey of discovery can lead you to all sorts of interesting places, whether it's exploring a gripping fictional world or diving into something completely different, like expanding your knowledge with resources such as [Pharmaceutics II (Pharmacy Technician) Download Free PDF – Punjab Pharmacy Council Textbooks](https://pdfhive.com/pharmaceutics-ii-pharmacy-technician-download-free-pdf/). It’s all about finding what sparks your interest!

The book I want to talk about today isn't a textbook, though! It's called ""The Echoing Silence"" by a new author, Sarah Jenkins, and it's a fantastic blend of psychological thriller and a touch of the fantastical. Imagine moving into an old, creaky house with a mysterious past, and slowly realizing that its previous inhabitants might not have truly left. It follows a young woman, Eleanor, trying to start fresh after a personal tragedy, only to find herself entangled in a chilling mystery that blurs the line between memory, madness, and something ancient stirring beneath the floorboards. It's not a jump-scare fest, but more of a creeping dread that really gets under your skin.

What I really liked about ""The Echoing Silence"" was its atmosphere. Jenkins has a way with words that just paints such a vivid picture – I could almost feel the dampness of the old house and hear the whispers in the shadows. The pacing was superb, too. It started slow, building that sense of unease bit by bit, and then it just ratcheted up the tension until I was practically holding my breath. I found myself staying up way too late, just needing to know what was going to happen next! The characters felt real and relatable, especially Eleanor. Her emotional journey was incredibly well-portrayed, making her struggles and fears feel very genuine. It really made you root for her, even as you wanted to shout warnings at the pages!

Now, was there anything I didn't quite like? Honestly, it's tough to pick too much apart. If I had to be super critical, maybe one or two of the secondary characters felt a *tiny* bit underdeveloped compared to Eleanor, but it was a minor point in an otherwise compelling story. The ending, while satisfying, left just enough open for interpretation that I'm still thinking about it – which, for a psychological thriller, is probably exactly what the author intended!

I would absolutely recommend ""The Echoing Silence"" to anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller, especially if you like a bit of a supernatural twist. If you're a fan of books that make you question what's real and what's not, or if you just love a story that keeps you guessing, this one is for you. It's a great example of how a well-crafted narrative can draw you in completely, much like how dedicating yourself to understanding complex topics can be truly rewarding, whether it’s the mysteries of fiction or the detailed information found in a guide like [Pharmaceutics II (Pharmacy Technician) Download Free PDF – Punjab Pharmacy Council Textbooks](https://pdfhive.com/pharmaceutics-ii-pharmacy-technician).

**A Little Guide for New Readers & Tips for Everyone:**

If you're just getting into reading, or trying to read more, here are a few simple tips that might help:

1.  **Don't Force It:** If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, it's okay to put it down. There are so many amazing books out there; life's too short to read something you don't enjoy!
2.  **Try Different Genres:** Don't limit yourself! You might think you only like fantasy, but a good historical fiction or even a non-fiction book could surprise you. You never know what will click until you try it. This is where exploring resources like [Pharmaceutics II (Pharmacy Technician) Download Free PDF – Punjab Pharmacy Council Textbooks](https://pdfhive.com/pharmaceutics-ii-pharmacy-technician-download-free-pdf/) could even be a step towards broader reading habits!
3.  **Set Small Goals:** Maybe aim for 15 minutes a day, or one chapter. Small victories add up!
4.  **Find Your Spot:** Whether it's a comfy chair, a quiet coffee shop, or during your commute, find where you enjoy reading most.
5.  **Join a Community:** Like right here on Reddit! Talking about books with others can make the experience even better and introduce you to new titles.

Happy reading, everyone! I'd love to hear your thoughts if you've read ""The Echoing Silence"" or if you have any recommendations for similar books.",1,1758711589.0,pdfhive,0,1.0,False

I had just quit my soul-sucking corporate job and decided to open a coffee shop-slash-bookstore in a quirky little neighborhood. Think *hipster Hogwarts but with more espresso*.

I called it “Brew & Browse.”

Business was… okay. Some days were marvelous; others were more *me drinking inventory and questioning my life choices*. Then *she* started coming in.

She had this ridiculous habit of ordering the most chaotic drinks like, “quad shot iced caramel soy mocha with extra whip and a dash of cinnamon, shaken not stirred” type of orders. We’d always joke that I needed a PhD in mixology just to serve her.

Let’s call her *Emma*.

Now, Emma was funny. Like, *spit-out-your-coffee-in-front-of-a-customer* funny. She came in almost daily, always had a sarcastic comment about the state of the world, and I started timing my breaks to talk to her. Totally normal business behavior, right?

Here’s where it gets weird.

One day, while joking about how confusing her order was, I said, “You know what? If you can order that same drink three times in a row without changing it, I’ll marry you.”

She smirked and said, “Challenge accepted.”

I thought nothing of it.

Fast forward three weeks. She walks in, slams her loyalty card on the counter (completely filled out), and says, “Time to cash in. You said you’d marry me.”

I laughed.

She didn’t.

I panicked.

In my defense, I was running on three hours of sleep and eight espresso shots, so my brain did the unthinkable: I pulled out one of those ring-shaped coffee stoppers, went down on one knee, and said, “Will you be my co-owner and life partner?”

People *cheered*. I wish I was kidding.

Emma? She said yes.

We were both in too deep to back out, so we *actually started co-owning the shop* together. We signed a real agreement. She turned out to be a business genius. Profits doubled, she revamped the whole loyalty program, and introduced a section called “Rom-Com Reads & Regrets” that became a local hit.

And the best part?

Six months later, I proposed again. For real this time. With an actual ring and significantly less caffeine in my system.

She said yes.

So now, we run Brew & Browse as a married couple. Business is booming, we fight over Spotify playlists instead of spreadsheets, and every now and then someone asks if the story on our website is real.

It is.

Moral of the story? Don’t joke about marriage with someone who knows their worth — or do, because obviously it’s great for business.",1,1758711262.0,u_RemoteSafeer,0,1.0,False

We get to the church early (to help cook) so I can eat real food.(Chinese in comparison to Nachos, I'm an adult) As I'm scarfing down food, my mother(53f) calls. Mom:""Hey, are you mad at me?"" Me:""Hey man, why would I be mad at you?"" Mom:""well you seem mad..."" Me:""Really Mama?""

Backstory: My Grandmother is turning 80 next yr, after my daughter's Grad party. I told my mom what I wanted to do for my daughter (great grad theme, I'll tell you after the party.) Her venue was $1800 and with this being senior yr... let's just say I warned everyone that we were locked in for the year to afford ALL THE SENIOR THINGS to include a new car (her father gave her a car...you know... another story time) Our daughter made the SAT score to go to college for free on top of our VA benefits. She attends a performance art high school as a theater major. (Thespian parents shout out!) Our daughter doesn't give us even 1/2 the crap we gave our parents. Overall, she a good girl who deserves ALL the things, I'm a proud Mom, so yeah... I'm going to show out. In the midst of me explaining in detail what I was doing for my daughter... she get this idea that Granny's party should be just as extravagant. Kool, Granny is turning a BIG BLESSED ONE, so no problem. My mom goes on and on about what she wants. Then I start asking questions like any good party planner, to which she has no real answers. This a a weeks long conversation with no resolve. She asked me if I can help and I told her I couldn't. We were spending thousands this senior year. I thought she undstood... No, it's about what she wants for Granny. Day before, I told her everything sounds good and we should do her plan, just plan it already, I'll stand behind you, but I can't afford to fork over the funds, I'm tapped. The next day... this happened. 

Me:""Mom, I'm not mad at you. I can't really talk, we are waiting for Youth Night to start, I'll call tomorrow."" Mom:""well I feel like you mad at me,  I'm your mom,  I know when you mad at me!"" Me:""Mother,  we good,  but I gotta go!"" At this point,  ministers wife shows up,  I'm done eating,  it's time to set up for Youth night.  I get the car, go in the building and start cooking with the ministers wife. I'm minding my business and my daughter comes in the kitchen with this look on her face...""Mommy, I need to talk to you!"" We leave the kitchen and go outside the building (and yes,  remember we have a guest with us... my daughters friend. Me:"" what happened, friend you okay?"" Daughter's friend:""yes ma'am, I'm fine."" My daughter:""Mimi just called, I need to tell you what happened before it comes back misconstrued... She called and said she wanted to send you some coffee money for Starbees (Starbucks) but she didn't want you to know it was from her, so she wanted to Zello (Zelle) me the money. I told her I didn't have Zello, I have cash app. I explained how it worked and she got mad at me bc she couldn't get the app to work fast enough. She's frustrated and asking why I don't have Zello, I told her if she didn't want you to know, send it to Daddy, he has a Zello. I gave her my user name 4 times and she got so mad, she cussed me out and hung up! I'm telling you bc I know this will look like I didn't help, but I did. She's yelling and fussing at me for not having what she needed!""

The reason I believe my daughter is bc what my daughter doesn't know is my mom is an alcoholic. I can tell my mother's tells.  She starts shouting, cussing high,  and slurs. My mother hasn't talked to my daughter in at least 7 yrs. Yes... 7yrs. She stopped being my daughters grandmother a while ago. It took me some time to understand my mother issues bc she hid it well... but then again she didn't, I was late to the party... denial.  

I told my daughter to shake it off, we can't afford to harp on that. Shake it off and act like it didn't happen... for now. Her and friend hug and I cracked a joke. We all laughed and we go back in the building. When Youth night was over, after we dropped her friend off home, it's time to talk. I asked my daughter to explain the whole story over again. As she's telling me, I'm debating with myself if I should I tell her. I stopped at a red light and as she was talking I said,"" Baby girl, your Mimi is an alcoholic!"" Hardest and felt funny coming out my mouth bc it hit me to in that moment. My daughter is confused. Her:""Wait... what... Mimi?"" Me:""Unfortunately, yes...it's true."" With tears in my eyes. I proceed to tell her the tall tale signs of what it looks like for her Mimi. Her mouth... wide open.  

A few weeks after,  my mom called,  and now I'm telling her about the graduation tickets how many,  what day,  and who the tickets were for.  My daughter wanted ALL 3 of her parents,and their parents, 2 Aunties, and my Granny. My mother throws a fit.  Nawh, her and my step dad won't go. My daughter has other family that she can ask.  My daughter doesn't want her there. Now... I recorded my daughter saying she wanted her parents and grandparents there... she still says no, my daughter doesn't want her there. My daughter fine, don't come. My daughter remembered the youth night and said that she didn't want her there anymore, bc she could tell she was drunk and didn't want to be embarrassed on her big day. I totally respect what she's saying, but I didn't tell my mom yet. A few days pass and she asked what color does she need to wear for graduation. The same graduation, we kept inviting you to, you said my daughter has ppl who would rather be there... you didn't need to come.  My daughter said,  she doesn't talk to her,  over talks, not really interested, so she stopped and that's why it has been so long. When we go home to visit, we visit Granny. My daughter said, if she doesn't apologize before the new year, she's going to grant her Mimi her wish and they (step dad to) won't be there, she doesn't want them  unless she apologize to her. Hubby and I think that's fair.  My mom doesn't know what's on the line,  but if she doesn't apologize,  she won't get a ticket.

 AITA for not stepping in and trying to get them to work it out? Maybe for telling my mom what's on the line... too much time has past and she's not making it better. ",13,1758711135.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,6,0.85,False

1np8vnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1np8vnv/help_deciding_between_2_good_job_offers_what/,Help deciding between 2 good job offers. What would you do?,"Hi Folks,

I’m in the very fortunate position to be deciding between two very appealing job offers and I’m looking for any words of wisdom or advice you may have as I make my decision.

I’m currently on £50K and have about a 1-hour commute which costs roughly £2.3k annually in train tickets. My background is in Town Planning and Socio-Economic policy, working in private-sector consultancy for the last 9 years. I’m 32 and no kids or mortgage (yet) and my other half earns about the same as I do.

**Job 1**

Company: Large-scale banking/financial institution

Role: Corporate Social Impact

Salary: £63k

Benefits:

·       Defined contribution pension (If I put in 6% they’ll put in 15%)

·       5 – 10% annual bonus

·       30 days annual leave + bank holidays

·       Colleague Shares plan

·       Private medical, onsite gym, etc.

Location: 25 minute walk from home

Current Status: I have currently accepted this offer and am in the vetting process. The offer for this one came in while the interviews for Job 2 were being arranged, so I made the tough call to accept this one and withdraw later on if Job 2 comes out on top.

Pros:

· Role seems like a great opportunity to stretch myself and apply my skills/experience to a new industry. It’s a new role with a remit to shape business practices, which I think is exciting.

· Everyone I interviewed with (over 3 rounds stretched over 3 arduous months) was really switched-on and clearly very smart and engaged. They were *hard* interviews but I really enjoyed the challenge and I could tell the people I was speaking with were operating at a really high level. Some great potential colleagues/role models here.

· Good routes for advancement and potential for development/seniority. Higher potential earning.

· The person who would be my manager has offered to come out to meet me for a coffee in the coming weeks (she's based on the other side of the country) to talk through the team/role and get to know each other. She seems super nice.

Cons:

· Would be a career pivot into an industry (banking/finance) I don’t know much about and might not like

· My team would be spread over different offices, so not together all the time. Not a dealbreaker and they sound really supportive of teams traveling between offices to meet up often, but something to consider.

· This company has had loads of redundancies over the last year or so, all of which have been applied to different business areas (tech, etc.) and roles which could be more easily offshored. Since this role would be within their corporate advisory team I’m hoping it might be slightly safer (also it’s a brand new team, so hopefully they won’t do an about-face and eliminate it right away). However I’m not entirely naïve and know I’m taking a risk on this front.

· Are banks the baddies?

This one feels like a bigger risk since it’s outside my comfort zone (I might hate it!) but potentially a bigger reward and higher ceiling in the long term.

 **Job 2**

Company: Combined Authority/Local Government

Role: Socio-economic and policy research

Salary: £52.5k

Benefits:

·       Defined Benefit Pension (Local Government Pension Scheme)

·       26 days annual leave + bank holidays

·       Rest of the package is all pretty standard stuff

Location: 15 minute walk from home

Current status: I am in the shortlist of 2 people. I have the final interview on Monday. I’m conscious I don’t have an actual offer for this role but I want to be prepared in case they do offer me the role following the interview. Part of me hopes I don’t get the job so I don’t have to make the decision between the two.  

Pros:

· From a technical perspective this role sounds right up my street. It’s a subject I know really well and am hugely passionate about, so I feel like I could hit the ground running. Lots of opportunities to geek out about stuff I love.

· People to learn from and develop my skills in an area I am passionate about. Perhaps setting me up for a PhD someday (long held aspiration).

· Less of a career change, still staying closer to my current industry but focusing on the parts I like the most.

· Exciting opportunity to influence policy and regional development

Cons:

· Lower salary and less clear routes for advancement. For context I've received 4 other offers this year all ranging between £59k - £64k, so this feels low.

· Stereotype that working in the public sector/local government is soul crushing. I’m trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, however my first interview did include them asking a lot of questions about how to “motivate my team in the face of bureaucracy”, “managing stakeholder gridlock” and “how to manage research which is never implemented or routinely ignored”. This didn’t exactly fill me with optimism.

· The people I interviewed with (one of whom would be my team lead) were a bit “dead behind the eyes” and were really disengaged. The interview was in-person and they literally had blank faces the entire time and hardly engaged with my responses or anything. Such a weird experience and makes me wonder what it would be like to work with these people.

· I have an old colleague from a previous company who currently works in this organisation and she was so difficult to work with and downright nasty that the idea of having to deal with her again is a downer. She wouldn’t be in my immediate team, but I would be working alongside her quite a bit.

· Obviously fewer perks and less glamourous office. Not a huge deal, but part of the public sector compromise.

**Summary**

In terms of the technical day-to-day work I am more confident in Role 2 since I know what it would entail and I know I really love that type of work. It’s deep within my comfort zone and I feel like from a moral perspective I would be “fighting the good fight”. However, there are so many other factors that play into job satisfaction (your team, office/corporate culture, bureaucracy, salary, etc.) so I’m leaning towards Job 1 if I’m honest, even though there are huge unknowns there too.

I also hate the idea of backing out of an offer I’ve already accepted (I’ve done it once before and have felt guilty ever since). I still have the final interview for Job 2 on Monday and am going to use this as an opportunity to ask all my questions so I can make as informed a decision as possible.

Any tips, words of wisdom or hard truths are much appreciated! Thanks everyone.",1,1758710882.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

I had **protected sex on August 31**. My period was from **August 20-26**, and according to my Flo app, I ovulated around **September 3**, which would have been my fertile window. The condom **didn’t break**, but there was **probably some precum inside, no ejaculation**.

I’ve also had unprotected sex in the past where there was precum, and I **didn’t get pregnant**, so I’m wondering if that matters here.

Around **September 13** (3 days before my expected period), I felt a slight **itchiness/scratching in my boobs**. After **September 16** (my expected period day), I noticed some **growling noises in my abdomen**, my cervix felt different, and my discharge is **kind of sticky/watery inside, mostly white on the outside, but stretchy**. No breast pain, nausea, or fatigue. .

On **September 18**, I went to a theme park and got **sick, with a** runny nose, sore throat, still feeling unwell. I took a pregnancy test on **September 20**, around 12 PM (not first-morning urine, only had tea and coffee), and it was **negative** line at all.

Today it’s **day 36 of my cycle**, and my period still hasn’t come. Because of **stress and panicking**, I’ve been **peeing more often**, though I usually pee frequently anyway. In the past, I’ve had some **longer cycles**, but since the condom didn’t break, why would I be pregnant?

**Am I overthinking, or should I retake the test with first-morning urine?** Any advice or similar experiences would help.",2,1758710866.0,amipregnant,5,1.0,False

I’ll be honest because I don’t like wasting time on fake or shallow connections.
I live with BPD, depression, social anxiety, and complicated family issues. That makes me attach quickly if I like someone. So if you’re not serious about building a genuine friendship (or something more if it happens naturally), don’t bother.

Basic info
Age: 19
Height: 163 cm
Weight: 57 kg
Personality type: INFP-T
I’m leaving a toxic family situation soon and planning to seek asylum in London (I’m from Kuwait). That’s why, if things ever go beyond friendship, it has to be with someone older than me and living in the UK. I’m not interested in long-distance.

Beliefs
I used to be Muslim, but I’ve left religion. I still believe in a Creator, just not in organized faiths.

What I like and value
	•Honest and genuine people who can appreciate emotions.
	•Deep conversations, not cold replies or surface-level small talk.
	•I enjoy space, stars, astronomy, rain, nature, coffee, matcha, and sometimes video games.
	•I like calm atmospheres: dark rooms, candles, good music, and a drink in my hand.
	•Creative things like music, photography, writing, and art in general.
	•I value people who give back the same energy they receive.

Music taste
I usually listen to Melanie Martinez, Lana Del Rey, Billie Eilish, Cigarettes After Sex, Arctic Monkeys, Halsey, Radiohead, Aurora, Beach House, The Neighbourhood, and more.

How I am in relationships
	•I can’t stand narcissists and fake people. If I feel used, I cut people off completely.
	•I hate temporary friendships that don’t last.
	•If it gets romantic: when I love someone, I get clingy, obsessive, and stalker-like. If you can’t handle that, don’t try.
	•My mood changes a lot. Sometimes I’m funny and weird, sometimes I’m quiet and sad. I’m shy in person and it takes time before I feel safe enough to show my real self.

Extra
I have a thing for dilfs (handsome ones, I’m too pretty to be with anyone)

Important
If you want to talk, introduce yourself properly. Otherwise, I won’t reply.

We availed a full wedding package that included a glam team and photography. Last July, we had our prenup shoot. Since it was a package, the glam team offered me an upgrade to airbrush makeup worth 5k, while the photographer offered an aerial shot upgrade worth 3.5k. I was fine with the idea of upgrading, but I got worried because it was raining during our shoot, and we were getting wet so I thought it wouldn’t be worth it. Plus, the aerial shoot was only for the last part, and the save the date video wasn’t even 5 minutes long, so I said NO to their offer. I thought everything was fine after that.

But here’s the problem
it felt like the glam team lost their energy. The package was supposed to include unlimited retouch, yet they barely did anything. My makeup ended up cakey because of the drizzle, and they didn’t even bother to fix it unless I specifically told them (like just changing the hairstyle per set). Most of the time, they were just on their phones. Even worse, my groom didn’t get any grooming or touch-up, even though it was part of the package! Nakakainis talaga.

As for the photographer, I also felt disappointed. The pictures looked like they were done half-heartedly out of focus, lacking creativity, and not the kind of shots I was expecting. I couldn’t even choose a decent picture for our e-invites because the shots just weren’t good. This is despite the fact that we provided them with snacks, coffee, and even free lunch during the shoot.

I already told the coordinator that I want to replace the glam team since I wasn’t satisfied with their work, but for the photography team, I’ll just keep it as is. The thing is, I’ve been following up with them since August, and until now, there are no updates. I’m getting really worried that on the actual wedding day, the results will also be disappointing. I don’t want to waste our money and end up stressed with the output.

This is just the amount of restaurants per cuisine I saw (in rough order of abundance). **I didn’t try everything, so this is more observation than a definitive guide.** I am not going to make things up about food I didn't try.

**Thai**  
The dish you’ll see everywhere is *Khao Soi*, a curry noodle soup usually served with a chicken drumstick and crispy fried noodles.

It does have a unique flavour, rich broth, and unavoidable in Chiang Mai.

Pad Kra Pow (minced meat stir-fried with holy basil and rice) is also everywhere, though I think it’s a bit overrated. Pad Thai is around too. Even in a month with everything to try I still wasn't able to have as much Thai food as I wanted.

There is also Thai boat noodles which I loved in terms of the soup/noodles but I was not a fan of the meat balls they put in them. Texture was like a cheap hotdog.

Street food is part of the scene: motorbike stalls selling coconut ice cream, longan fruit, grilled chicken and pork ribs, mango sticky rice. I tried a few BBQ stalls at the markets – decent but nothing mind-blowing. The standout was a quirky stall dedicated solely to Japanese mushrooms on skewers.

There are a few stores solely dedicated to mango and durian based desserts. There was also 2 brownie dessert shops one I went to had brownie shots in mini cups and you pour your chosen sauce over each so its drenched. It was amazing.

**Japanese**  
This is the main non Thai cuisine where Nimman shines. The quantity and quality of Japanese food is off the charts. Main strengths are curry cutlet rice, ramen, sushi, yakitori, izakaya bars, takoyaki, and plenty of matcha desserts.

The one thing missing? Hamburger steak , there was barely 2 restaurants in the area serving it.

There’s even a chain called *The Volcano* serving sweet cheese toast (small portions but tasty). Loads of Hokkaido milk based desserts too. Ice creams and cakes made etc with the sweeter, premium milk from Hokkaido. Milk bread and stuff you haven't dreamt of of course.

On the high end you’ve got a couple Wagyu steakhouses and luxury sushi, but some yakitori bars are affordable and seriously good.

Botan restaurant was a hidden gem. I got tempura curry rice and okonomiyaki seafood pancake I think this was like £4.50 and this is 2 meals.

**Chinese**  
Plenty of hot pot, Sichuan, Hainanese chicken rice, and Hong Kong–style food. All excellent, which makes sense given the number of Chinese tourists. I only went to a couple but I am too much of a noob to try hot pot for the first time solo in another country.

Plenty of pecking duck as well. I wasn't a fan of the hanainese white chicken rice even with the satay sauce it was a bit bland but the fried chicken at those places is good.

**Craft cafes**

Literally heaven Roast8ry , Saruda pastry, FOOHIDE, Charlie Thai tea some really unique drinks. Also a few smoothie dedicated joints like Joost or Goodsmood that looked cool. Didn't try those two but will when I revisit.

Was able to take home 3 thai tea bags from Charlie Thai tea for £13. Drinks there are something straight out of a high end cocktail bar and are all under £2.50 Best Thai tea I have ever had.

There is a growing culture with promotion from the government for locally grown coffee, chocolate tea as well which is interesting.

**Korean**  
a few Korean barbeque spots as well as non KBBQ. I did go to 2 Korean restaurants twice. I didn't like either of them I mean the first time I got Tteokbokki , way too sweet and spicy in a way that doesn't go together tbh.

Then got Ramyun noodles at a restaurant. Just red spice with literally no other flavour whatsoever had a chewy texture like some fancy korean instant Ramen noodles I have tried. K BBQ was a bit out of budget that time. The seafood pancake I got wasn't as good as the Japanese version okonomiyaki agai it lacked flavour and no garnish sauce. Just my opinion doe.

**Vietnamese**  
Mostly the classics: banh mi and pho. Solid but not nearly as dominant as Japanese or Chinese. I only had Bhan Mi once. This was another cuisine I really wanted to more try but the restaurants just happened to be further out.

**American / Western**  
A fair amount of wings, burgers, and pizza joints. Nothing groundbreaking compared to back home, but the quality is still good. I did try a makeshift wood-fired pizza stall really tasty, but pricey at about £8 per pizza.

**Burmese**  
A couple of places around. I tried a noodle soup with good broth, but the noodles were thin, small, and slippery not my favorite texture. I did like the Burmese tea it was at 'the 90s burmese cafe' I think

**South Indian**  
A handful of vegetarian restaurants. Limited in number, but the one I visited were solid. Got the Thali which was 2 meals.

**Other**  
Everything else drops off after that. Middle Eastern food was rare I only spotted one or two places on Google Maps and didn’t go to any. Probably still wouldn't as I eat it a lot at home where I live.

Chapter 1





To test my husband's work abilities, Dad arranged for me to conduct a surprise inspection of the company he manages.





The moment I walked in, some blonde bimbo in a barely-there dress was staring at the industrial paper shredder like she'd discovered fire.





""OMG, this machine is like, so cool! It eats paper!""





Before anyone could stop her, she grabbed a contract off someone's desk and started feeding it in.





A coworker dove across three desks: ""WREN, NO! That's a millions-account!""





Too late. SHRED SHRED SHRED.





""Oopsie! My bad!"" She giggled, then immediately knocked over her venti frappuccino all over the main server.





Sparks flew. The lights died. Twenty computers crashed simultaneously.





The entire office sat in stunned, furious silence.





I grabbed a shell-shocked intern: ""What mentally unstable person hired this walking disaster?""





He whispered back in terror: ""That's Mrs. Morrison—the boss's wife. She... she technically owns half this company.""





Mrs. Morrison?





I speed-dialed Dad right there: ""Cancel the test! Give Jaxon one hour to pack his shit and get out—him and his precious little ornament!""





He wants to cosplay CEO while babysitting his pet disaster? Not on MY family's payroll!





...





Dad sent me to the company to evaluate Jaxon.





He said it was routine inspection, told me not to stress about it—just think of it as getting familiar with the business early.





I figured it was just going through the motions.





So I told the receptionist I was an auditor from corporate, and she respectfully swiped me through with her keycard.





But the second I entered the office area, I spotted this woman.





She was dressed super innocent—white sundress from Target and everything—crouched in front of the paper shredder, looking totally fascinated.





""OMG, this machine is like, totally insane. Can it literally shred anything?""





Without thinking, she grabbed a document from the desk next to her.





The cover was stamped in red letters: ""MERGER CONTRACT.""





She didn't even hesitate—just started shoving the contract toward the shredder.





A guy with glasses nearby went absolutely pale.





He basically threw himself at her, nearly tackling her to snatch the contract away.





""Holy shit, Wren! Weren't you supposed to be gaming in the office?""





His voice was shaking with terror.





""What are you doing out here? This contract goes to print this afternoon!""





The woman got bumped by him but wasn't mad at all—just giggled and waved her empty Dunkin' cup around.





""Gaming got boring. I'm literally dying of thirst.""





The coworker let out a relieved breath, clutching that contract like his life depended on it.





He lowered his voice, practically begging:





""Then please, go grab some water and drink it back in the office, okay? Doesn't Jaxon's office have its own Keurig?""





The woman pouted.





""That coffee tastes nasty. I want some of that good stuff from the break room.""





She totally ignored his about-to-cry expression and headed toward the kitchenette.





Watching this whole trainwreck, my temples were pounding.





I grabbed a young-looking intern nearby.





""Who is she?""





The intern glanced at me, then quickly looked back at the woman's retreating figure, eyes full of dread.





He put his finger to his lips.





""Shh, keep it down.""





He leaned close to my ear, voice barely a whisper.





""That's our boss Jaxon's wife, Wren.""





My heart dropped, and suddenly all of Jaxon's weird behavior lately made perfect sense.





The intern kept talking.





""Word is she actually owns this company, so she's like, the real queen bee around here.""





""You just start? You'll get used to it.""





He sighed, his face showing the kind of bone-deep exhaustion that only comes from being put through hell.





""Usually she just hangs in Jaxon's corner office, gaming and binge-watching Netflix. Doesn't really mess with us.""





""Jaxon must be out at client meetings today, so nobody's babysitting her. That's why she's out here wrecking everything.""





Listening to him, my head was buzzing.





She's the boss's wife.





Then what the hell am I?





The intern noticed my expression and looked concerned.





""You good? You look kinda rough.""





I shook my head and forced a smile:





""I'm fine, just... wow.""





""Can't believe the company has people like that. Real eye-opener.""





The intern shrugged with a bitter laugh.





""You get used to it. At least she doesn't actually do anything major. We all just deal and pray she gets bored and goes back to her office.""





I stayed quiet.





Doesn't do anything major?





That contract she almost shredded? That would've tanked a billion-dollar deal.





Who's gonna eat those losses?





I watched Wren bounce out of the kitchenette, literally skipping and humming some Taylor Swift song.





I pulled out my phone, about to call Dad.





But then I thought better of it and put it away.





Just leaving now would let Jaxon off way too easy.





Dad sent me here to evaluate his abilities.





Looks like his abilities AND his character are completely fucked.





I wanted to see just how far this company had gone down the drain under his management.





I straightened my blazer and walked to reception.





""Hi, I'm Brielle from corporate, here for project auditing.""





""Could you set me up with a temporary workstation? Somewhere quiet would be perfect.""





""Also, today's inspection is confidential—I'd prefer Mr. Jaxon doesn't know I was here.""





The receptionist nodded respectfully.





I found a corner desk and sat down, keeping an eye on Wren from across the room.





She was studying the fire alarm with her fresh Starbucks, looking like she was seriously considering whether to yank that thing.





Chapter 2





Jaxon was MIA all morning.





Wren must've gotten bored gaming in the executive suite.





She wandered back out like she owned the place.





First she'd mess with someone's design mockups they'd been working on all morning.





Then she'd randomly hit keys on people's computers, screwing up their spreadsheets.





Everyone was pissed but couldn't say shit—they'd just freeze when she got close, then frantically fix whatever she broke after she moved on.





Then she drifted over to the water cooler.





Probably thirsty again, she grabbed a paper cup to fill up.





Whether she's just clumsy AF or doing it on purpose, I couldn't tell.





Her hand jerked.





A full cup of water went flying in a perfect arc, splashing all over the wall next to the cooler.





Right where the main electrical panel was.





There was this loud ""POP!"" with sparks shooting everywhere.





Every light in the office died.





All the computer monitors went black at once.





A few seconds later, the whole place erupted with screams and ""WHAT THE FUCK!""





""My code! I've been coding all morning! It's not saved!""





""My Photoshop files! The client's been blowing up my phone and I was almost done!""





""My quarterly reports! They're due at 2! I'm so screwed!""





The IT manager came flying out of his office.





He saw Wren standing there looking all innocent after causing this disaster, and his face went dark.





His mouth opened and closed, fists clenched, but he swallowed whatever he was about to say.





Wren actually spoke first, voice all whiny and victimized.





""Ugh, what's happening?""





""This electrical stuff is like, total garbage. A tiny bit of water and it breaks? Why does our company buy such cheap crap?""





The nerve of this chick blaming everyone else was honestly next level.





The facilities manager came rushing over.





He looked at the smoking, fried electrical panel, then at Wren.





Immediately switched to this pathetic ass-kissing mode.





""Wren, you're not hurt, are you? Did the sparks scare you?""





""This totally isn't your fault—the wiring's probably old. We'll get it fixed ASAP, install a new waterproof system!""





""You go chill in the office, we'll handle all this.""





Wren pouted, looking unsatisfied, but didn't push it. She headed back to Jaxon's corner office.





The facilities guy finally wiped the sweat off his forehead and started barking orders at IT.





When he walked past my temporary desk, I stopped him.





""Does this kind of thing happen a lot?""





The manager looked at me, recognized I was from corporate, and his expression went bitter.





He pulled me into the stairwell and lowered his voice.





""You're the auditor, right? I probably shouldn't be running my mouth, but after today...""





He sighed heavily.





""Real talk, she's Jaxon's princess. We can't touch her.""





""Today Jaxon's in Chicago for client meetings, so nobody can babysit her.""





""When Jaxon's around, at least he keeps her locked in his office playing mobile games...""





His face showed pure defeat.





""Last month, she had another 'oopsie'—knocked over her Frappuccino.""





""It went straight into our main server.""





""All our data got corrupted. IT pulled all-nighters for a week trying to recover everything. A whole week of everyone's work, completely trashed!""





""What happened then?"" I asked.





""Jaxon blamed IT for 'inadequate safety protocols' and docked everyone's quarterly bonuses.""





""Said it would 'teach us responsibility.'""





My stomach kept dropping.





So, this is Jaxon's leadership style?





Let some airhead wreck the company while hardworking people pay for her stupidity.





Jaxon, you're really something special.





Just then, the executive office door opened.





Wren poked her head out and called to the dark office.





""Ugh, I'm so bored! When's the WiFi coming back?... Oh no! My phone's at like 10%!... Are there any snacks in the break room?""





Nobody answered.





The entire office was dead silent, thick with frustration.





Chapter 3





IT had just gotten everything back online when Dad called.





He needed me to pull some sensitive marketing data.





Said the files were needed for this afternoon's board meeting at our Manhattan headquarters, and I had to handle it personally—zero margin for error.





I grabbed a USB drive, downloaded the data from the marketing director's computer, and headed to the copy room.





I'd just finished printing everything and was organizing it with binder clips when the copy room door swung open.





Wren bounced in with a bubble tea from the place downstairs.





Hell, she immediately spotted the heavy-duty stapler next to me and her eyes lit up.





""Ooh, lemme borrow that real quick—my Hot Cheetos bag totally ripped.""





She reached over like it was hers.





I instinctively pulled the confidential documents and stapler away from her grabby hands.





These files contained seriously classified intel.





She whiffed completely, stumbled forward from the momentum, and tripped over the printer cord.





Her boba tea went airborne.





The brown liquid sailed in a perfect arc and splashed all over my freshly printed documents.





A thick stack of corporate secrets instantly turned into a soggy, illegible mess.





Staring at the destroyed files, I couldn't keep playing observer anymore.





I looked up and locked eyes with her.





Yet she had zero guilt on her face—actually looked pissed that I hadn't shared the stapler.





My voice was ice cold.





""You gonna take responsibility for trashing these documents?""





Wren had probably never been called out by a company employee before.





She blinked, confused.





Then her face flushed red with anger.





""Excuse me? How dare you talk to me like that?""





""Do you have any idea who I am?""





She straightened up, acting all high and mighty:





""I'm Jaxon's wife!""





Looking at her, I felt absolutely nothing—almost wanted to laugh.





""Cool.""





I replied flatly.





""Does being Jaxon's wife give you license to destroy company property? To completely ignore workplace policies?""





My pushback clearly threatened her little power trip.





She lost her shit, pointing right in my face:





""Um, yeah, it totally does!""





""This whole company belongs to Jaxon, which means it's mine! I can do whatever the hell I want!""





Her voice went full Karen mode, all screechy and entitled.





""Who even are you? Some random new girl trying to school me?""





Other employees came running when they heard yelling.





Seeing this confrontation, they looked terrified.





A few admin assistants kept tugging at my sleeve, silently begging me to apologize and back down.





I didn't budge.





I just stared her down.





When I wouldn't cave, Wren felt humiliated in front of everyone.





She whipped out her phone with this smug, vindictive smile.





""Okay, wanna act tough? Think I can't handle some nobody?""





""I'm FaceTiming Jaxon right now to show you exactly who runs this place!""





She hit video call immediately.





The call connected within seconds.





She flipped the phone toward herself, ready to have her ""husband"" come to her rescue.

On my very first day, I walked right into a woman waving a marriage certificate around, bossing everyone at the front desk.



""Do you fucking understand what a marriage certificate means? This makes me the one and only Mrs. Kane!""



""Quit slouching—back straight! Is your spine broken, or can you just not see me standing here? Keep your head down! Don't move until Mr. Kane gets here!""



""This cafeteria garbage is what you're serving? I'm having Michelin-starred chef come spice things up for you people!""



I was about to march over there when a coworker yanked me back.



""That's Mr. Kane's first love. I heard he had to propose like 99 times before she finally said yes...""



She nodded toward the marriage certificate, trying to save my ass.



""Piss off Mr. Kane and you're just fired. But mess with his wife...You're done.""



I nearly burst out laughing.



Then I pulled out my phone and called my brother.



""Tyler, get Christopher down here now. Tell him to bring that fucking divorce papers. Five minutes. I want to see him on knees, begging.""

Then I pulled out my phone and called my brother.





""Tyler, get Christopher down here now. Tell him to bring that fucking divorce papers. Five minutes. I want to see him on knees, begging.""





Today was my first day as an intern.





I was standing by the front desk, about to head to HR and check in, when this woman in a high-end suit came storming through the entrance.





She slammed a marriage certificate down on the reception counter.





""New intern, huh? No wonder you have zero manners!""





""Why are you holding those files up so high? Trying to hide your face or just think I'm an eyesore? Put them fucking down! Stand up straight with your hands at your sides!""





Sticking to the intern playbook, I kept my head down and my tone flat. ""Hello, how can I help you today?""





That simple ""hello"" lit her fuse.





She got right in my face, voice dripping with attitude. ""Are you fucking kidding me right now? Does HR even bother teaching you people basic manners anymore?""





She flicked my name badge with her finger.





""Look at this certificate, then look at that pathetic little badge. What part of this situation makes you think you get to talk to me like we're equals? It's Mrs. Kane to you!""





The girl interning with me went white and quickly grabbed my arm, jumping in with a bow. ""I'm so sorry! Mrs. Kane! She's new – totally clueless about how things work. Please don't be mad!""





he woman let out a cold snort, rolled her eyes at us, and strutted straight into Christopher's private office.





My fellow intern immediately whispered to me. ""That's Evelyn Grace. Mr. Kane's first true love. Do NOT mess with her. She whispers one bad word about us and we're toast – our internships are over.""





I was seriously confused. Christopher only had one marriage certificate, and it was locked away in our apartment safe.





So why the hell was he letting this Evelyn chick strut around his office with some fake certificate and showed off ?





I shoved my questions aside for now.





I was here to complete this internship bet and see how Christopher actually ran his company.





Might as well sit back and watch just how crazy this fake ""Mrs. Kane"" could get with Christopher apparent blessing.





Chapter 2





Right when lunch break hit, Evelyn got on the intercom and called straight down to admin.





I picked up the phone and her shrill voice came through. ""I want a hand-ground coffee. Blue Mountain, water at exactly 185 degrees. Bring it to the office. Right now.""





I rushed to the break room, but hand-grinding the beans takes time, so I was maybe five minutes late.





Those fucing five minutes? She completely lost it.





When I speed-walked in with her coffee, she whipped her hand up.





""What the hell is wrong with you people in admin? Look at the clock! You're five whole minutes past my optimal tasting window! Do you have any idea how much that temperature drop ruins the flavor profile?""





""If you've screwed up my afternoon, can you handle what comes next?""





Every single person in admin turned to stare at me.





Evelyn looked picture-perfect with her flawless makeup and expensive outfit, but her bitchy attitude had everyone cringing.





I kept my voice steady and professional.





""I'm really sorry, Ms. Grace. Hand-grinding just takes a few extra minutes.""





She grabbed the mug right out of my hands and dumped the hot coffee all over my arm without blinking.





""With your clumsy ass, how'd you even get hired here? Sleep your way in?""





""You little slut! Start cleaning out your desk!""





I clenched my fists so hard my nails cut into my skin. The burn on my hand mixed with anger.





Right when I was about to lose it, Rebecca Stone, our admin supervisor, came flying over and stepped right between us.





""Oh god, I'm so sorry Ms. Grace! She's totally new here – this is on me! Please don't stress yourself out over this. She's not worth getting upset!""





She grabbed my arm and hissed under her breath. ""Do NOT do anything stupid! Think about who she is. She could get our whole department's bonuses cut! She's not worth it! Just let me deal with this!""





Watching Rebecca kiss her feet finally made Evelyn happy. She took her sweet time pulling out a tissue to wipe her hands.





""Well, at least someone around here has half a brain.""





Her tone was dripping with arrogance. ""Come on. We're doing a walk-through of the cafeteria.""





A walk-through? What right did some outsider have to inspect company facilities?





""Ms. Grace, the cafeteria has security protocols. We can't just let anyone walk through..."" I started to say.





Before I could finish, Rebecca yanked my arm hard again.





""Don't you get it? She's Mr. Kane's precious baby.""





""Piss off Mr. Kane and maybe you can fix it. But cross her? You'll be gone before you know what hit you.""





""He treats her like a damn princess! Everyone knows she's the real lady of the house around here! Our jobs depend on whatever mood she's in! You're still on probation–don't be stupid!""





The real lady of the house? Since when?





And here I am, the real Mrs. Kane, and I didn’t even know?





Seeing me frozen in place, Evelyn probably thought she'd scared me senseless. She let out this nasty laugh.





""Aw, what happened? Cat got your tongue as soon as I mentioned Christopher?""





""Here's a reality check, honey. A man like Christopher is so far out of your league. One word from him and you'll never work in this entire industry. Capisce?""





Chapter 3





While I stood there in silence, Evelyn had already bulldozed her way into the employee cafeteria.





""Jesus Christ, what kind of slop are you people eating?""





She picked up a piece of meatloaf with two fingers in disgust, then tossed it back down.





Then, she pulled out some fancy container from her Hermès bag and slammed it down on the serving counter. ""You poor people have probably never tasted real food in your sad little lives. Well, Lucky for you, I have a good mood today. I'm gonna let you try some truffle risotto from Le Bernardin–time to class up this pathetic excuse for lunch!""





She popped open the container and was about to dump it straight into the communal food trays.





""Ms. Grace! Absolutely not!""





The cafeteria manager finally lost it and dove in front of the food stations. ""Company policy is clear – no outside food gets mixed with employee meals, period! This is about health codes and liability! Don't make me the bad guy here!""





""Policy? Health codes?""





Evelyn looked at him like he'd just told a dumb joke.





""You think my gourmet food is gonna kill someone? This container cost more than you make in a year, jackass!""





""Move your ass!""





The manager planted his feet. ""Ms. Grace, I'm not budging! One food safety incident and we're all screwed! Please don't put us in this position!""





Seeing that cafeteria manager actually had the nerve to keep defying her, Evelyn's face twisted with rage.





She grabbed her phone and hit video call.





""Christopher! You need to see this shit! Your employees have lost their fucking minds! I'm trying to do something nice and improve their meals, and they're actually yelling at me!""





Christopher's smooth voice came through. ""Babe, calm down. Put the cafeteria manager on.""





Evelyn shoved the phone right in the manager's face with a nasty smile.





Christopher's tone went arctic. ""Every single person involved apologizes to Evelyn right fucking now! Or you're all getting fired for insubordination. Kiss your paychecks goodbye this month! Try me!""





The cafeteria manager's lips were trembling. Rebecca and the other staff went pale, exchanging helpless looks.





Christopher seemed pissed at the silence and his voice got even more vicious. ""What the hell? Do I need to spell it out for you morons?""





The video suddenly flipped around.





Evelyn turned the camera so we could see Christopher's side. He was in some fancy private dining room with a bunch of suit-wearing businessmen – clearly in the middle of closing some major deal.





Christopher was at the head of the table. When he saw Evelyn's pouty face, shook his head in undisguised affection. There wasn't even a hint of irritationm, just complete infatuation.





""Christopher baby...""





Evelyn totally ignored that he was handling business and started fake-crying into the camera.





""Look what they're doing to me! They're all being so mean! I just wanted to share something special and they're treating me like shit! They're crushing my heart here! You have to do something!""





She squeezed out some theatrical tears.





The helpless victim act was a complete mindfuck compared to the psycho bitch she'd been thirty seconds earlier.





Christopher's face went stone-cold.





He didn't even ask for the full story – just laser-focused on his poor little Evelyn.





""Hey, hey, don't cry baby. You'll ruin your makeup. This isn't worth getting upset over, okay? I've got you. Nobody fucks with my girl!""





He kept his voice soft and soothing, then looked back at our side of the camera with daggers in his eyes.""Are you people brain-dead?""





""I'm ordering you right now – do exactly what Evelyn says! Apologize!""





""If I don't see some serious groveling in the next three seconds...""





Before he could finish his little power trip, I stepped right up to the phone camera.





My face – and my burned, blistered hand – took up the entire screen.





""Christopher, you sure you want me to apologize?""
