It's compulsive to have some first thing in the morning but it just pushes things along and doesn't give my body time to properly breakdown what I eat and form good bowel movements. It's like sandpaper going through me.

So I've found two things to give me relief. Weed and ejaculation. Due to my religious beliefs I'd like to abstain from the latter but my bowel movement wasn't so good and easy afterwards. But honoring God is more important than my pleasure.

Weed helps me focus and relax. 

But ultimately I'm getting some mental health evaluations done so maybe a med can help which seems like something less frowned upon. I did take Effexor for my ""nervous gut"" before but it made me into a zombie and didn't help my work life. So since weed is a stimulant to me and also helps me focus and relax so I'm not full of anxiety and unable to focus and do what's right I'm getting tested for ADHD to help me hopefully because it certainly doesn't seem to be a body chemistry thing by how ejaculation and weed can ease the bowel pressure and relax my gut and help me have easier bowel movements.",1,1756641972.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

I didn’t see if it came from the wand or if it was internal. I let the machine cool down, took a look at the boiler valves to see if anything looked out of place, but visually everything looks normal. Turned it back on to see how it will behave, and now after 40 min it hasn’t heated up at all. The water comes out room temperature and there is zero pressure in the steam wand. Could it be the thermostat? Heating element? Impossible to know without professional diagnostics? Would really prefer not to get it professionally serviced if avoidable because they charge like £300-400 which is enough to buy any tools I’m missing and learn to do it myself.

1n4sy08,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1n4sy08/my_prepre_plan_execute_review_process_for_using/,My [Prepre -> Plan -> Execute -> Review] process for using Claude Code in my B2B marketing agency,"Hey all - been getting deep into the 'Claude Code for non-coding tasks' and sharing my current process that I'm building for my agency. 

This is the process I’m using to create on-brand marketing assets for B2B GTM teams that I'm using for writing tasks, design, and some coding. I’ve included overall process and a specific example for one step in my workflow. If you find this interesting, drop a comment. I'm not super technical but trying to figure things out.  
  
Anyway, here's the overall process that I'm using:

1. **Prepare:** give the model a heads-up of what you’re going to be working on in this session. I’ve got a detailed explanation about the project in a README.
2. **Plan:** get into the specifics of the task at hand, building the to-do list etc. For repeated tasks I use a custom slash command (sometimes with $ARGUMENTS for variables), or just raw dog a new conversation. This is all in planning mode.
3. **Execute:** once I’m happy with the plan, I let Claude Cook
4. **Review and** ***selectively*** **improve:** this step has the biggest improvement in outputs

*Tactical note: the tasks I’m working on are quite varied so accounting for every situation a single* [*CLAUDE.md*](http://CLAUDE.md) *file doesn’t make sense. This README approach allows me to be more flexible.*  
  
Now here’s a specific application of this process that I’m using to create Brand Systems for clients

1. **Prepare**
   * Start a new chat, use a /new-chat slash command to prompt Claude to review the README to get up to speed with the project.
2. **Plan - all in plan mode**
   * Use a custom slash command to explain the part of the process that we’re working on i.e., /brand-system:01-start
   * This explains the part of the process that we’re going to be working on with the files to expect in the next prompt
   * Another custom slash command with the below inputs
      * Location of the design reference images to use the brand system, which are referenced as $ARGUMENTS since the location changes depending on the client I’m working with
      * A generic JSON template with the structure of the brand system
   * A detailed prompt with instructions
   * Since I’m in plan mode, I review Claude’s todo list to make sure it’s aligned. For the brand system, it’s usually pretty standard. Other steps in my process require more iteration.
3. **Execute**
   * Run the todo list, check twitter, grab a coffee
   * I usually use Opus 4.1 for creative tasks like design and writing, especially anthing multimodel (like this example where I’m sending images)
4. **Review - initially in plan mode, then switch to run**
   * Plan mode
      * Once I have the output, I have another custom slash command with a lengthy review prompt, specific to each step in the workflow. I also re-share the design reference images
      * Importantly, the custom prompt focuses on just listing **issues**, not suggesting any fixes
   * Here, I review the list of issues and choose the ones that I want to implement
   * Execute mode
      * Implement the suggestions
   * In most cases, one loop of this review/issue is enough. Some steps in my workflow are more judgement based so for those I’ll run through review/improve loop a couple more times.

**Questions you might have**

* Why don’t you use single larger prompts instead of splitting things up?
   * For my workflow, splitting tasks into these smaller steps tasks feels like it gives better outputs
   * This helps me to build the relevant context and feels like it ‘primes’ the model for the primary task
   * This is 100% anecdotal but it works for me
* Where do you save the custom slash commands?
   * I keep the the custom commands and other things like writing guidelines, templates, etc. in the project repo so I can use github to manage versions
* Why don’t you use subagents for some of these tasks?
   * For my workflow, maintaining a single context for discreet tasks works best
   * Subagents spin up a fresh context each time so don’t do the trick for me. The tasks I’m working on require building context from previous steps
* How are you using custom output styles?
   * I’m experimenting with these, e.g. for the copywriting that I do as part of my process
   * I’ve got a business copywriting output style that helps to convert input text (e.g. call transcripts) into marketing copy for some output (e.g. case studies), but it does require me providing a guideline/template of the structure that I want to follow

1n4sx7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpatFIRE/comments/1n4sx7c/business_assistant_service_feedback/,Business Assistant Service Feedback,"Hi everyone,

We’re working on a new **executive mobility** and **business assistant** service and would love your feedback.

When flying into any major city for a short business trip, transport is only part of the equation. The real cost is the time and focus lost to small tasks, last-minute printing, navigating between meetings, finding a café to work, or waiting on Ubers. A simple Uber won’t anticipate your schedule, and even a chauffeur only solves the driving. Not every up-and-coming entrepreneur has the budget for a full team or a personal assistant, yet those inefficiencies often mean less preparation, less composure, and weaker results in the meetings that matter most.

We want to solve this by giving you a **dedicated driver/business assistant** for the entire day. From airport or hotel pickup, they’ll handle your schedule smoothly, getting you to meetings on time, finding work-friendly lunch spots, running quick errands (printing, coffee, deliveries), and keeping your day free of hassle.

It’s about more than convenience. Having a professional assistant by your side also adds to your presence and image, helping you show up focused, composed, and prepared, instead of stressed or rushed.

We’re currently testing pricing at **€250/day** **all-inclusive (car + driver + assistant)**. Our goal isn’t luxury for the sake of it, but efficiency, reliability, and peace of mind for expats, entrepreneurs, and business travelers who may not have a big corporate team but still want that level of support.

Would this be something you’d find valuable (or see others using) when traveling for business?

- House music / DJ spaces/ events 
- Independent coffee shops 
- Breakfast and lunch cafes 
- Orchestral music - maybe some opera
- Menswear fashion shops 
- Other events in the city which we might not learn about from Google! 

Basically - any advice and reccs are appreciated! We are trying to not fall into the usual tourist traps and find some cool stuff to do which we might not be able to learn about through the usual sources.

1n4sva1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcaret/comments/1n4sva1/xcaret_arte_review/,Xcaret Arte Review,"Well. We’re currently sitting on the bus back to Cancun International so I guess this means the trip is officially over. We’d like to pay back for all the posts we’ve read that helped us make our decision. 

Dates: 8/24-8/31

Building: Artistas 

Overall: Xcaret was absolutely insane. The views, the service, the food options and just the resort layout itself had us incredibly spoiled. We’re always planning another trip back here and would 100% stay in Artistas again just because this place truly can’t be compared to much else. There are plenty of pools to hang out in, but the options to go to parks during the day just makes it that much better. 

Food:

What Hit:
- Chino Poblano (8 course)
- Encanta (8 course)
- Mercado de San Juan (Always)
- Fuego (dinner & breakfast)
- Tah Xido (a la carte)
- Artistas rooftop pool (menu and drinks)
-  Kibi Kibi (breakfast)
- Cantina VIP
- Any of the resort food stands 
- Coffees at cafecito & cafeteca 


What Missed:
- Kibi Kibi (dinner)
- Cayuco (not awful but did not stack up to others)

Parks We Went To:
- Xplor
- Xel-Ha (we did SeaTrek and Adrenalina dream activities)
- Xcaret Park

Things We Didn’t Love:
- Butlers — I think it was a mixed bag, as other couples we met had a great experience. We found ours to not be particularly helpful or useful. We’d made our reservations ahead of time, so their usefulness for us was just changing a reservation once and helping us cancel a park on a day we didn’t feel great. They did nothing wrong, but for the value of the Artistas building it did not stack up to what others have reported on here. It was our honeymoon and outside of the initial resort-wide heart snack, there wasn’t much else they went out of their way to do that made us feel special. We tipped our butler staff at the end unlike most other services where we tipped ahead of time (room service/restocking) or during. We joked that maybe we should throw them some mid week money to see if the services improved, but we didn’t see our butlers after the first night so that strategy wouldn’t have worked for us lol. 
- Room service was mixed. We loved breakfast & late night tacos we got one night, but the coffee and margarita pizza were not great but no matter the time of day we ordered, it came quickly so that was a huge plus. 
- Nightlife is pretty limited to El Deseo & Cantina VIP. We really enjoyed our time & are not big partiers, but it’s good to make note that there’s not a ton to do at night except for those two places, especially once the pools and bars close

Things We Loved: 
- Literally everything else, we met so many kind people and there was food/art/music in every corner of the hotel. 

Tips: 
- Ask for the signature/house drink at the bars. Some will offer you a menu where the signature drink is clearly indicated (Artistas rooftop - Jacaranda is 10/10), but others we just asked them to surprise us with a house drink which was almost always delicious.
- Take at least a day to just chill & explore the hotel. There is so much to do in terms of food & activities just in the hotel! Especially for Artistas where you have access to the Mexico side as well, we spent about half the time in the hotel & still left with things we wanted to do.
- Do your research on what you want to do at each park, many of the parks offer the same activities which we didn’t know until visiting (Ex. Both Xel-Ha & Xcaret offer swimming with dolphins, SeaTrek, adrenalina speed boat). We actually ended up opting away from Xenotes as we felt we’d gotten to swim/zip-line and other activities enough from the other parks.

We will absolutely come back at some point in the near future. Some of this may seem a bit picky, but it is an expensive resort and so we held it to a high standard of what we expected versus what we invested. In nearly every facet, it totally met or exceeded what we had hoped for. We haven’t been to any other AI in Mexico, but everyone we met who had, said Xcaret Arte was above & beyond anything else they had experienced. ",7,1756641649.0,Xcaret,2,1.0,False

1n4ss7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningTrainingShoes/comments/1n4ss7z/explore_the_asics_geldedicate_8_tennis_shoes/,Explore the ASICS Gel-Dedicate 8 Tennis Shoes Review for Comfort and Stability!,"The ASICS 1042A235-103 Gel-Dedicate 8 Tennis Shoes caught my attention as a blend of performance-driven technology and everyday wearability, making them a promise of comfort for both avid tennis players and casual sneaker enthusiasts. As someone who spends a considerable amount of their day on their feet, having a good pair of shoes isn’t just a luxury—it’s a necessity. I tested these shoes thoroughly over the course of a week, both on and off the court, and here’s what I found.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek design is the first thing that hooked me. With a white and pure silver color scheme, these shoes manage to look effortlessly sophisticated while remaining sporty. Perfect for tennis practice and equally suitable for post-game coffee runs. The outer polyester material contributes to the lightweight feel, while the synthetic leather toe overlays enhance durability. You can easily tell they’ve been built with longevity in mind, though I did notice that lighter colors like these might be prone to dirt stains if you’re not too careful.

**Comfort and Cushioning**  
Comfort wise, the Gel-Dedicate 8’s cushioning system doesn’t disappoint. The standout feature here is the GEL technology cushioning. I noticed its effect immediately—it provides an incredible level of shock absorption, especially when landing after a swift move or pivot during a match. Unlike some shoes that feel bulky with added cushioning, this one hits a sweet spot between softness and responsive firmness. Even stepping into them for the first time felt gratifyingly plush. My feet felt supported even after several long matches and walking stretches.

[Check ASICS 1042A235-103 price on Amazon.](https://crosner.com/p/b0by3rg4k7/)

**Performance Features**  
When it comes to stability, the TRUSSTIC technology embedded in the outsole is a clear winner. It noticeably improves balance, especially during swift side-to-side movements. Additionally, the wrap-up outsole design seems to provide extra grip, and I appreciated not slipping even during the more frantic moments on court. As someone prone to twisting ankles, this aspect felt reassuringly secure. However, if you’re venturing into hardcore training, the grip is good but perhaps not exceptional compared to premium-level tennis shoes.

**Eco-Conscious Details**  
A unique highlight not found in many products is the solution dye sockliner. Not only does it complement the shoe’s functionality by wicking moisture away—keeping feet drier—but it also aligns with environmentally conscious standards. According to ASICS, the dyeing process reduces water usage by 33% and carbon emissions by 45%. Anyone looking to reduce their personal carbon footprint could definitely get behind this.

**Strengths**  
- Stylish design blends sportiness and elegance.  
- GEL technology cushioning ensures great shock absorption.  
- TRUSSTIC technology improves foot stability for intense movements.  

**Pitfalls**  
- The white color scheme might be challenging to maintain for some users.  
- While stable, grip could fall short for professional-grade training sessions.   

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the Gel-Dedicate 8 against alternatives like the Adidas Barricade or Nike Court Air Zoom, it fares remarkably well in categories like comfort and environmental consciousness. While the Barricade offers more advanced grip technologies, it sacrifices a bit in cushioning compared to the GEL technology here. Similarly, the Nike Court Air Zoom delivers outstanding traction but feels slightly bulky in prolonged casual use. The ASICS shoes walk the perfect line between sports functionality and daily usability.

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of value, this pair justifies its pricing due to its balance of features and long-lasting build. It’s designed with every key aspect in mind: durability, comfort, and performance. More importantly, you won’t feel like you’ve overspent since the versatility extends well beyond tennis courts, getting you more bang for your buck.

Lately, I have been feeling these urges that I need to sleep every hour. When I take a nap, it only last around an hour and after another hour, I would get sleepy again and the cycle continues. When I don't take a nap, I get this very uncomfortable feeling which leads me to sleeping again.

Hit the gym for 2 hours. Read 50 pages a day. Completely overhaul my diet. Go from zero to hero in a week.

You know what happened? I'd burn out in 5 days and quit everything. So I decided to take a step back. And start from the bottom. 2 years later I've read over 20 books and have lost 20kg.

Here are the 9 stupidly simple habits that transformed my life one tiny step at a time:

* Habit 1 - Read 10 pages every morning. Not 50. Not a whole book. Just 10 pages with your coffee. That's 3,650 pages a year. About 12-15 books. You'll accidentally become one of the most well-read people you know.
* Habit 2 - Did 10 push ups the moment I woke up. Before checking your phone. Before coffee. Before anything else. It's not about getting ripped. It's about proving to yourself that you can do hard things first thing in the morning.
* Habit 3 - Writing down what I'm grateful for. Takes 2 minutes. Rewires your brain to notice good things instead of only problems. After 6 months, you'll be the person who finds silver linings while everyone else complains.
* Habit 4 - Drinking water before doing anything. 2 glasses of water when you wake up. Before coffee, before anything. Your brain is dehydrated after 8 hours of sleep. Feed it water first, stimulants second.
* Habit 5 - Making the bed Sounds stupid. Works incredibly well. You start every day with a completed task. You end every day coming home to something neat and organized.
* Habit 6 - Daily walks after a meal. Not a workout. Just a walk around the block. Better digestion, improved mood, clearer thinking. Plus you'll accidentally get 8,000+ steps a day.
* Habit 7 - Phone in another room at night. Charge it somewhere else. Use an actual alarm clock. Better sleep, better mornings, less mindless scrolling. Your future self will thank you.
* Habit 8 - Learned everyday. A word. A fact. A skill. Anything. Watch a 5-minute YouTube tutorial. Read a Wikipedia page. Ask someone to teach you something.
* Habit 9 - Planned the day before. Spend 5 minutes writing down your top 3 priorities for the next day. Wake up with purpose instead of decision fatigue.

It took sometime to fully integrate all this habits but I'm so glad I pushed through. I hope I motivate you to do the same as well.",9,1756640708.0,TheImprovementRoom,1,1.0,False
1n4skr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n4skr5/the_bells_in_the_woods/,The Bells in the Woods,"I figured it’s finally time to share something that’s been bothering me for years. I don’t know what to call it exactly. It’s not a haunting, not really a cryptid thing. I guess it falls under weird rural stuff. You can decide for yourself.

 

Back in March 2022, my dad lost his job. He worked for a manufacturing company outside of Cincinnati, and after the layoffs hit, we couldn’t afford to stay in our place in the suburbs. My mom passed a few years ago, so it’s just been me and him. Money got tight fast, and before I knew it, he was talking about “starting over somewhere quieter.”

 

He found a job doing accounting for some local co-op way out in eastern Kentucky. I won’t say the exact town, but it’s small. Real small. We moved into this old white farmhouse with peeling paint and a wraparound porch. The backyard goes way, way back into the woods. Like acres of trees with no fences, no trail markers—nothing. Just dense, knotty forest.

 

I was 17, and I did’t exactly blend in there. The high school has less than 200 students. Everyone knows everyone, and they can sniff out a “city girl” like me in two seconds. No Starbucks, no Uber, and the internet cuts out whenever it rains. I started spending a lot of time in my room, trying to make the best of it.

 

Anyway, the weird stuff started happening maybe six weeks after we moved in.

 

It was late June. I woke up around 2am, not for any particular reason. No bad dream or noise. I just kind of opened my eyes and lay there, staring out my window. My room faces the back yard, and there’s no streetlights or anything, so it’s pitch black most nights unless there’s a good moon.

 

That night was one of those weirdly still nights. No bugs, no wind, just dead quiet. And then I heard it: bells.

 

Not like church bells or wind chimes. Not a single cat bell, either. It was… layered? Like a group of small handbells being rung at once. Tinkling and discordant, almost musical but not quite. I thought I imagined it at first, but it came again about thirty seconds later. Soft, distant, and echoey, like it was coming from deep in the woods.

 

It was subtle, but eerie. Just a few seconds of delicate jingling, then silence. It kept happening randomly until the sky started to lighten up with dawn. I barely slept.

 

The next morning I told my dad. He laughed and said it was probably a stray cat or some birds. I told him it wasn’t a bell on a collar—it was a group of bells. He shrugged it off and went to work. I let it go for the moment, but I started keeping track after that.

 

I heard the bells again a few nights later. Same time—around 2am. Same pattern: short bursts every now and then, always from the woods. I tried recording it, but they were too faint for my phone mic to pick up. One night I left the window cracked to try to hear better. That made it worse. I couldn’t sleep with that weird sound drifting in and out of the darkness.

 

About a week later, I woke up and came downstairs to find my dad looking really tired. He said he’d stayed up working on tax stuff for the co-op and hadn’t gone to bed until 4. I asked if he’d heard anything.

 

He didn’t say anything right away, just gave me this strange look, then said quietly, “I heard the bells last night.”

 

I waited, hoping he’d laugh it off again. But he just sipped his coffee and said, “That’s not a cat.”

 

I asked him what he thought it was.

 

He said, “I don’t want to know.”

 

That really unsettled me. My dad’s not the superstitious type. But that day, I started walking the woods behind our house. I figured I’d find a wind chime stuck in a tree or some weird hunting gear. I didn’t.

 

About half a mile in, I found something that felt… wrong.

 

It was a mound. Not a natural hill, but a clear raised shape in the middle of a clearing. Maybe seven feet tall and fifteen feet across. Oval. Covered in oddly green grass and little wildflowers, even though the rest of the woods around it looked dead and brittle. The air felt heavier there, like before a storm.

 

I climbed on top and stood there, not sure what I was looking at. I didn’t have much time to figure it out, because a voice behind me nearly gave me a heart attack.

 

“Found Jumbo,” it said. I spun around so fast I nearly fell off the mound.

 

There was an old man standing at the edge of the clearing. White beard, denim overalls, and a mangy old dog next to him. He looked eighty if he was a day.

 

“No one believes it’s a jumbo,” he said, then started laughing—this raspy smoker’s laugh that turned into a coughing fit.

 

I didn’t ask what he meant. I just took off back toward the house and didn’t stop until I was inside, door locked, curtains closed.

 

That night the bells came back. I sat in bed with headphones on full blast just to block them out. I didn’t sleep.

 

A few weeks later, I missed the school bus home. Dad was working late, so I decided to just walk. It’s a two-mile walk down the winding country road, past fields and old houses. No sidewalks. I was about ten minutes from home when I passed a house with a sagging porch and a bunch of metal yard art. That’s when I heard it.

 

“Girl!”

 

I froze. It was the same old man from the woods.

 

“Wait right there,” he said, and disappeared into the house. I honestly should’ve kept walking, but I was curious—nervous curious, if that makes sense.

 

He came back out a minute later with a yellowed newspaper folded under one arm.

 

“Told you it was a jumbo,” he said, handing it to me.

 

He’d already folded it to a specific page. It was dated August 1935.

 

The headline read: “Carnival Elephant Dies on Route to Exhibition Grounds – Buried Near Ridge Grove.”

 

There was a grainy black-and-white photo. A few men stood around what looked like a massive lump in the ground. One of them was clearly the handler. Next to him stood a performer in a checkered costume, wearing a jester’s hat with three bells dangling from it. I stared at the photo for a long time.

 

The man clapped me on the shoulder and said, “That’s where you live now.”

 

I ran all the way home, newspaper still in my hand.

 

I didn’t sleep that night either. The bells came back, more frequent this time. Almost like they were circling. All I could picture was that jester in the woods. I tried to tell him, but Dad didn’t want to talk about it anymore, and honestly, I didn’t want to push it. Had he seen something that night he was up late?

 

But the bells never really stopped. Some nights they’re quiet, just the occasional jingle far off. Other nights they’re closer. Once, I could swear I saw something move in the tree line. Not an animal. Just a shape. Watching.

 

I don’t walk in the woods anymore. I keep my curtains closed. And I haven’t heard from the old man again.

 

But I think about that photo a lot. The jester standing beside the elephant. The bells on his hat.

 

I wonder if he comes back sometimes. If he’s visiting the grave of his old friend. Maybe performing one last act.

 

I just wish he’d do it somewhere else.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1n4si73,https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1n4si73/recommendation_for_good_affiliate_programs/,Recommendation for good affiliate programs,"Hi there,

my main profession is web design, and I’d say I’m a mediocre one. I know how to build basic and somewhat more complex websites, including e-commerce ones, without too many bells and whistles. I’m thinking of creating a website to promote products using affiliate links. I’m actually better at ads than at web design, which is also why this idea tempts me.

I’ve done some research on affiliate programs, specifically Rakuten, Temu, and Amazon. I’ll write a few words about each so you understand why I’m asking here. :)

**Rakuten:**

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn’t even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn’t started promoting anything yet. After looking into it, I found out what I just said, it’s a horror story. I’m amazed they’re still in business; they should be getting sued every day. So that’s a no, I don’t want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

**Temu:**

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

**Amazon Associates:**

You’d think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon’s growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I’ve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn’t count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I’m pretty disappointed, and it seems like it’s not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren’t good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days — not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

No need to pay huge commissions, but not peanuts like Amazon either

Don’t randomly close your account with money in it for no reason

Basically, just some decency and respect for the time you put into promoting their products, nothing more.

1n4shrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1n4shrx/to_captain_with_love/,To Captain With Love,"The brief from the Federation was a shrug in legalese: *special mission, Amiculi theater, low-collateral footprint,* and then a quiet addendum from a colonel who built a career on failing upward: “You’re… suited to this. They say nice things disarm people. You aren’t people.”

They picked me to deal with the Amiculi, the galaxy’s friendliest war criminals, whatever the hell that means… because I don’t throw parties. I’ve fought battles most never walked away from, dropped alien overlords no one else dared get near, wars that chewed up legends, so yeah, I figured I could handle these clowns.

Two deputies, ten killers, one gunship that smelled like burned coffee and solvent, that’s my weather. My deputy Riva checked the seal on her chestplate and the cabin lights slid across her irises like they were choosing a favorite. The suit hugged like it had been made for trouble. My other deputy, Brek, stood beside the hatch, all angles and patience, hands folded, voice that arrived in bullet points even when it didn’t have to.

We burned onto an Amiculi picket ship riding a refuel spindle in high drift. Grapples kissed hull. The boarding tube thunked home and flexed. We blew the seam around an auxiliary airlock and went in on mag boots. White light, spall glittering, the taste of warm metal under filters. Three minutes of clean work, no speeches. Their squad leaders waved… *waved…* dropped their rifles, and jogged toward the tube like we were late to a group photo.

“This is a warship, not a hostel,” I told them, shoving bodies through the pressure door.

“Thank you for the free accommodation,” one said with a straight face.

We tossed them in the brig. When I came back to sneer at them (good for circulation), they’d rearranged bunks, scrubbed the stains, braided ration wrappers into garlands. A tidy one with neat wrists asked if there was a vegan option for the protein bars. My thumb found the safety by reflex.

Riva looked from the paper flowers to me, amused. “So the chatter wasn’t jokes,” she said, watching a prisoner polishing the bars. “They don’t take prisoners… they take plus-ones.”

Brek nodded once. “Field rumor confirmed: mid-firefight invitations, unconditional. Hospitality as doctrine.”

Next skirmish was a dockside scrape on a spokes-and-ring station, night-side market decks lit by vendor lanterns. We cut through a bulkhead behind a noodle stall, steam and gunpowder mixed wrong in the air. Same grin parade: rifles handed over butt-first, hands out for handshakes. We stacked them in the brig until the panel sighed red and told me there was nowhere left to stack. I paced the corridor like a dog that hates every wall.

Riva leaned on the bulkhead, helmet at her hip, mouth curved like she was humoring gravity. “Why are we feeding volunteers to the broom closet?” she said. “Use them. Let them take the first bite.”

“I don’t trust them,” I said.

“You don’t trust oxygen,” she said, shouldering past me, some impossible scent cutting through solvent.

Brek didn’t look up. “Deploy surrendering elements at the point,” he said, tone flat as deck plating. “Projected friendly casualties decrease forty-two percent. Also, the brig violates fire code.”

Against my instincts, I tried it. Next drop was a yard on a dusty moon, cargo crates for cover and sky full of tracers. I put the bright-eyed chorus at the nose. They did not die. They advanced in a neat chevron, boots thudding dust, clapped in some awful 7/8 time, and then *rescued* our flanking team when those idiots ran hot. They came back with enemy banners cut into picnic blankets and a medal somebody pinned to my chest for “inspiring leadership.”

“I told you to *die*,” I said on the ramp. “What part of *die* didn’t you catch?”

“We tried,” the medal-pinner said earnestly. “We thought you’d prefer us useful.”

The ship began to swell. Bunks vanished under quilts. Corridors clogged. You couldn’t get to the head without stepping over card games, singalongs, or a knitting circle.

Riva eyed the crowded corridor and smirked: “Congratulations, Captain. You’ve built the galaxy’s worst cruise line.”

I opened the armory once and six Amiculi tumbled out like clowns from a car. Krall, twenty confirmed, face like gravel, slept in my bunk in a hammock looped between two EVA suits, snoring like he’d always belonged there. He’d christened it *Command Net*. I considered a firing squad. They even put a tip jar outside my quarters: *‘For the Captain’s Patience.’* It overflowed. I kicked it over.

So I wrote new rules. “No hostages. No adoptions. Anyone tries to join, you put them down.”

They didn’t. Not once. Cez, who could break a jaw by thinking at it, came back from a sweep with flechette dings on his plate and banana bread wrapped in a napkin.

“Sir,” he said, not looking up. “They made me this. I…” He swallowed. “I couldn’t. It smelled like cinnamon.”

Brek marked his slate. “Recommendation: all units carry countermeasures for pastry warfare.”

Riva handed me a roster where Krall had scrawled new nicknames in block letters: *Snuggle Wolf. Cuddle Reaper. The Hugonaut.* “Morale’s amazing,” she said, eyes amused. “Want me to ask them nicely to act like you’re leading?”

Outside, we ran a zero-g boarding against a courier, mag clamps, cutters, drones with flashbangs that functioned like camera bulbs in vacuum. Inside, everything was cushions and tea. We took the bridge in spite of most of the attack team tripping over home décor that could only have been placed by an interior designer with military training. Every time I barked *“Silence!”* the corridors answered in perfect harmony, a hundred voices: “*We love you, Captain!*” The first time, I almost fired into the ceiling just to kill the echo. The second time, I just stood there with my jaw clenched and counted to ten while someone in the next compartment tuned a guitar. I told them I hoped most of them wouldn’t see tomorrow. They clapped politely, promised to try, and apologized for the oversight of still being alive.

Before the next drop, I built a proper war speech in my head, edges filed for blood. I got two sentences in. An Amiculi in the second row raised a hand. “Sir, if we kill them all, won’t they stop liking us?”

We hit dirt on a rust plain under a thin sky, point-defense spitting like angry bees. Instead of charging they laid out a full barbecue behind a wrecked loader, smoke curled into tracer lines and didn’t care. The enemy wandered over. Someone passed me a bowl of slaw and a fork like it was a ceasefire ritual. Fenn, hands like quiet knives, sat off to the side knitting a sweater for an Amiculi baby whose parents were apparently now on payroll.

“Is this a joke?” I asked nobody.

Riva checked her reflection in a magazine clip and fixed a loose hair with a half-smile.

“If there is a punchline,” Brek said, without inflection, “it is nonlethal.”

Doors became walls. New decks “appeared” where there hadn’t been space. We opened a storage locker and found a choir. Tenor section in dry storage, because of course. We opened the airlock and an Amiculi with careful hair apologized and slid aside with a tray of cupcakes.

I slept in the cockpit under a coat and dreamed in noise. When I finally snapped, it wasn’t a roar. It was a slow leak. Someone at the hatch leaned in, perfectly straight-faced: “Permission to access Command Net, sir?”

“This isn’t war,” I told my ship. “This is a floating daycare for smiling idiots.”

Brek didn’t look up from his slate. “Daycare would have fewer liability issues.”

Nobody argued. Somebody hugged me, somebody else apologized for hugging without consent. A small one tugged my sleeve and asked if I preferred *Captain* or *Dad.*

Then we hit a fight that mattered, relay spine in high polar orbit, five hard nodes chained by coil capacitors, rail batteries that could rake continents if you let them spool. No potlucks. We came in dirty: RCS puffs, burn-scars still bright, breachers in glossy shells tapping their visors. I put my killers at the tip. The hull shuddered as a slug skated our plates and the air tasted like rusted iron and fear.

“Maintain formation,” I said.

We cut into Node Three through a maintenance ring. White corridors, hazard stripes, pressure doors that wouldn’t make up their minds. Cez peeled off anyway to drag an Amiculi tech out of a crossfire. Fenn put down her blade to pick up a kid who shouldn’t have been anywhere near a relay. Krall took his helmet off so the soldiers shooting at him could see his face and *know* him, and… God help me… he smiled back when they smiled first.

“Return to… ” I started.

“Counterproposal,” Brek said, holstering his sidearm. He walked down a line of rail casemates with his hands up like he’d been waiting for that moment all his life, boots clicking calm on the deck while the world screamed.

Riva’s voice clicked in my ear. Through the canopy I could see her on the skin of the node, tether bright, suit lines neat, turning her head toward a cluster of gunners who had stopped aiming. “You’ll hate me for this later,” she said, and she went with him without looking back.

I tried to say *mutiny*, but the word fell apart. It wasn’t that. It was migration. Slugs stopped coming because nobody wanted to pull the lever that made them move. The mesh went quiet, not dead, *quiet,* like a song deciding it was done being a song.

So I surrendered.

You don’t surrender and get cake. Except I did, balloons, a banner: “*WELCOME HOME!”* and a round frosted thing in pink icing that said *You Tried!* with a crooked smile. The Amiculi with careful hair held it like an offering. Behind him, through a port, the planet turned and the rails slept.

“I’m in hell,” I said.

“No,” someone said behind him. “You’re in home.”

I waited for smug. It didn’t show.

They didn’t chain me. They ushered me, soft hands, apology-eyes, into a hall big enough to dock a cruiser and host a bake sale on top. Tiered galleries, banners with flowers, choirs perched like sentimental pigeons. Their corridors hummed like a well-tuned throat. My scowl reflected in the marble and tried to pick a fight.

“Feelings arena,” I said. “Fantastic.”

Looked like two of their leaders were set up at the center. Caretaker Pala: sash the color of good intentions, ledger cuffed to his wrist, kindness arranged in alphabetical order. Beside him, an ancient elder with gums where teeth should be and breath like a bakery dumpster on a sunny Sunday. Eyes finding me, then the ceiling, then me again, like a radio cycling stations.

“Welcome, traveler,” Pala said, palms open, tone pleasant enough to sand a table. “Share your name-story. We will keep it safe.”

“My name-story is I hate this,” I said. “Ugly scarves like yours should only be used for hanging, not fashion. End me with one, spare me this hell.”

I tore a “WELCOME HOME” ribbon off a rail and boxed out a square on the floor. “No-hug zone.”

They formed a respectful circle *around* it and hummed like they were blessing crops.

I walked to a doorway strung with brass bells where a door should be and rapped one with my knuckle, hard, simple.

The note drove through the hall like a nail.

Their permanent hum tried to meet it and stumbled. A soprano skidded a half-step and turned the color of paperwork. Two leaders started the same welcome and arrived in different sentences. Somewhere above, a tray clinked wrong. Fifty throats apologized to the air at once, which somehow made it worse.

I cracked the bell again, harder, the sound came out mean… and then it started.

Choir stands toppled into barricades, benches ripped up for shields, drones dumped fire-foam and slipped into the crowd while vendors hurled noodles like nets and kids started wailing.  
The air tasted of ozone and panic as glass spidered, chimes were snapped into shanks, the PA screamed feedback, lights strobed, and a rail shutter slammed on someone’s hand. “Hold,” Pala called, crisp, ledger hand shaking. “Affirm breathing pattern A. Social reset. Please…”

The crowd ignored him the way a storm ignores a lighthouse.

Riva stood very still, mouth a blade-width tighter. Brek’s eyebrows moved a millimeter: *phase transition noted*.

The old toothless elder shuffled close, hands out like approaching a stray dog wired to a bomb. Up close, the breath was a felony. His eyes shone like he’d polished them for this exact afternoon. “Oh,” he said, voice that laughed, wept, and prayed in one breath. “Little star. Forgive… ah… where did I put it.” He blinked, found me again, brighter. “You ring true.”

“I hit a bell,” I said. “Don’t make it poetry.”

“Not poem,” he whispered, delight curdling into awe. “*Pitch.*”

Niceness slipped its gears in earnest. The left choir lunged at the right. Ushers escalated from tug-of-war to slap-fight over a shattered tray. Leaders shoulder-checked for microphone access. The hum tried to reassemble, touched the note hanging off my knuckle, snapped to static, and came back angry. Banners sagged. A ceiling chime cracked. Somewhere a safety drone panicked and started offering pamphlets. Someone shoved a cinnamon roll into my hand like it was riot gear. The Amiculi were crumbling, their one great weapon, that seamless chorus of care, tore on my note like silk on a nail. Their spell broke in front of me.

Here’s the part I didn’t expect: I thought I’d feel good. Righteous. A little victorious. Spoiler: I felt sick. Like I’d rung the mindfulness bell and started a bar fight.

It landed like a bone in the throat: it was me. Not the blade I polish, the other thing, plain center, the pitch you tune to or break against. You can’t harmonize a tuning fork, it harmonizes you, or it breaks your choir. I was the nail and the wood was splitting.

Pala kept his smile by force. “We can integrate this signal,” he said, like negotiating with a hurricane. “With guidance.” His eyes flickered to the riot, back to me. “Help us, please...”

The elder beamed so wide his pink gums looked like tiny moons. “You are the one,” he breathed, eyes wet. “The king we were… prom… promisc… prof… profit… prophet… to set us in tune and lead us to saaave the galaxy*.*”

“Oh good,” I said. “I’m allergic to crowns. I’d rather choke on a scepter than wear one.”

On the balconies, shoves became punches. Petals became projectiles. Through the port, a coolant valve geysered because three crews grabbed it at once “to help.” The hall’s hum rose like a kettle and shattered like a plate.

“Captain?” Riva said, and for once, no sarcasm.

“An experiment with exactly two outcomes,” Brek murmured, calm as ever. “High honor, or the rogue king of daycare and armed toddlers, hunted by the Federation.”

Power. Responsibility. The shape I’d been avoiding my whole life sat on my shoulders like a rifle you can’t set down. It was heavy and it fit.

I touched the bell a third time, barely, and pinned the room to a clean, painful stillness.

“First lesson,” I said, loud enough to rattle the chimes and stop Pala’s ledger mid-stroke. “Everyone shut the fuck up.”

We finally listened to what *not singing* sounded like, and I felt the crown I didn’t want settle anyway.",2,1756640412.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

With a family that includes a toddler, a pet-friendly home, and an avid coffee drinker (me), stains are practically a daily occurrence. This product claimed a lot in its feature-packed description, so naturally, I had to dig in and see if it lived up to the hype. Spoiler alert: it mostly does, though there's a thing or two worth mentioning.

**Compact Design and Usability**  
One of the first things to jump out at me about this stain remover was the size and packaging: four small, 1.7 fl oz bottles that neatly fit in any cleaning cupboard. Frankly, the design is unintimidating and incredibly user-friendly. Each bottle is labeled with clear instructions and identifies the specific stains it’s meant to tackle, so there’s zero guesswork involved. A little goes a long way with the liquid, and the nozzle lets you control the flow so you don’t waste any. Honestly, with all the cleaning products I have lining my shelves, this specific detail makes a big difference.

**Want the lowest Carbona SD-FSB-A4 Liquid Stain Remover price? Click Amazon.**

**Varied Stain Targeting**  
The unique selling point of these bottles, in my opinion, is that Carbona tackled different stain groups instead of marketing one 'do-it-all' formula. For instance:
- Stain Devil #2 targets sauces, gravies, and other condiment-based spills. My salsa-stained kitchen towels didn’t know what hit them.  
- Stain Devil #4 is geared for pesky organic things like baby formula, blood (yes, this is realistic in parent life), and dairy mishaps.  
- Stain Devil #5 blew my mind with grease and oil stains; butter and olive oil were completely gone in under 10 minutes of application on cotton shirts.  
- Stain Devil #8 covers coffee, wine, and fruit-based stains. As someone who spills coffee almost every morning, this one has been a savior.  
Each one delivered as promised, though with slight variations based on the fabric and how long the stain had set in. The results? Shirts, tablecloths, and rugs looking like they’d never met marinara or spilled jam.

**Positives**  
I could go on about the highlights of this product, but I’ll keep it brief:  
- It’s tailored to address a wide variety of specific stains.  
- These tiny bottles pack enough cleaning power to handle stubborn messes.  
- Instructions make it idiot-proof, seriously reducing trial-and-error frustration.  

**Flaws**  
Still, no product is perfect, and there were a few shortcomings I noticed:  
- While they tackle individual stains well, you might find yourself going through bottles quickly if there are repeat offenders. A bigger size option would help.  
- The product descriptions make them sound like they’ll work universally, but they can sometimes struggle with older, set-in stains even after multiple applications.  
- Lastly, managing several bottles for different stains can become cumbersome. Sometimes you just want one cleaning solution!  

**Competing Products**  
In the world of stain removers, there’s no shortage of alternatives. Products like OxiClean MaxForce gel or Shout Advanced Gel stand out as Carbona’s main competitors. However, each has its quirks. While OxiClean is fantastic as an all-purpose spray, it doesn't have the same precise stain-targeting capabilities. Similarly, Shout offers quick treatment for fresh stains, but its overnight soaking requirements can’t compare to how Carbona works in a fraction of the time for most spills. That said, for anyone who prefers a single, catch-all product, there’s merit in taking a closer look at Carbona’s rivals.

**Affordable Quality**  
One key question that’s probably crossing your mind is: is this product worth what it costs? With so many stain removers doubling up as fabric softeners or brighteners (which this isn’t), it boils down to utility. These bottles, while individually small, are fairly priced for how effectively they perform on different hazards around the house. While some might find the multi-bottle system slightly gimmicky, I actually view it as a value proposition because I’m not wasting time or product trying to fix what doesn’t need fixing. Carbona’s specialized formulas really do justify the investment.

Service moves forward, now I'm second in line. The person in front of me steps up to order; the barista is busy and can't speak with him right away as she's preparing the previous order.

As the person in front of me steps \[EDITED\] rightward\*\*, he places his hands (one holding a phone fwiw) on the counter. Squarely on the laminated menu that's taped atop it.

Whereupon I say, ""Hi, I'm sorry. \[pauses to confirm I have his attention\] I'm hoping to read the menu right now, if that's alright. Do you mind moving your hands?""

Whereupon he tries to pick the menu up and hand it to me, but of course that doesn't work. He then sets his hands down on the counter again EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE. He wasn't wearing earbuds or anything either.

So... I guess it was too much trouble for him to move his hands 8-10 inches further down the counter?  Very mild ""gah""...

I’m just sitting here SHOCKED at the fact that companies now straight up THROW MONEY at us just to test their new features. Like, I always thought this was a myth from the early internet days. But apparently, there are actually LEGIT apps that pay you real cash—like, no joke, I checked my PayPal and money ACTUALLY showed up.

I HAD to share my findings because I know I’m not alone in being surprised. Here’s my TOP 7 list of bonkers legit apps that want you to test out the stuff everybody else will use NEXT YEAR. It feels like cheating real life:

- **BetaBucks**
  Like, imagine getting paid to try out redesigned TikTok feeds before anyone else. This app shows up with wild feature tests and doles out Amazon cards and direct deposits. My brain is melting.

- **SneakPeek**
  I got an invite and thought, WAIT that can’t be real—but it was. One of my friends got to literally vote on the next Messenger emoji buttons and got paid $20. How?????

- **TestFlight Swag**  
  Not just for devs—users can FINALLY get in and test full unreleased mobile game modes. Payouts vary but sometimes it’s rare in-game items and sometimes straight up money.

- **UsabilityShorts**  
  If you ever have 15 minutes, they want you. Weird interfaces. Futuristic AI chats. Even a smart fridge UI. Simple tests pay out almost instantly via CashApp. Test it—no more ramen for dinner.

- **TapTechTry**  
  Unboxing beta gadgets AND getting a reward? Pinch me. All you have to do is give your honest feedback. A little weird at first because some features are so new, they barely work—but the payouts are fine.

- **FieldPulse**
  This one’s not even just apps—you install “smart home” widgets, then rate how well they ruin/upgrade your life. My lights now dance? Thanks and also, please send more money.

- **GoodNovel TestApp**  
  I SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST. This one’s wild: you test brand-new AI-driven reading features for GoodNovel, and the payouts? Already funded a week of coffee for me. Check out **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (YES, it’s real!).

No, I am NOT kidding. I tried **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** myself because I was extremely skeptical. The interface is basically you > test stuff > tell them what’s good or broken > get paid. It’s a fever dream.

THE BACKSTORY 🍿

Last week, I was deep-diving down a Reddit rabbit hole (classic me), looking at ways to earn passive income.

Most suggestions were “meh,” but one comment caught my eye and dropped this link: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

Curiosity + massive boredom = Me clicking that link like a raccoon searching for shiny stuff.

---

WHAT. HAPPENED. NEXT. 🫨

I signed up on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and expected nothing... like, literally zero.

Then suddenly, I got a simple notification; downloaded an app to test it; shared a quick review about my *impressions*—not a full thesis, just a few lines and some smiley faces.

- 1st app: $3.25—deposited
- 2nd app: $7.50—DEPOSITED
- 3rd app: $10.00—say what now?

Decided to see if it was just luck. Went for more. By the time my coffee got cold, I was already at $30.49.

HERE’S HOW IT WORKS:

- Sign up for free on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (no super long forms!)
- Pick apps (they actually give you a list based on your interests!)
- Download, try, then rate honestly—NO shilling needed
- Watch as your balance literally goes up with each task 

Not even kidding, total time spent was less than an uninterrupted Netflix binge.

I couldn’t stop. Do you guys ever go into full **Grind Mode**? That was me.

By evening, after testing a total of 16 apps (⚡️some only needed 5 mins!) … my wallet flashed a beautiful, round $102 and change.

*I thought it was fake—until I hit withdraw, and the $$ hit my PayPal*. 😲

REAL TALK: THOUGHTS & FEELS

Is this for real? I’M STILL SHOCKED.

- This is literally the first time an “earn from home” thing wasn’t complete trash.
- The interface was cleaner than my apartment.  
- *NO intrusive ads, no endless surveys, no getting ghosted by customer support.*
- If you do even one mildly productive thing today, check out **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and just SEE what I’m talking about.

Why isn’t everyone doing this? Is this a glitch in reality, a loophole nobody’s using, or did I just stumble somewhere HELLA lucky??

I have friends working extra shifts all week for way less. Meanwhile, my thumb and over-caffeinated brain have leveled up big-time. 💸

1n4sa2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1n4sa2g/can_waterdrop_adq73613401_refrigerator_water/,Can Waterdrop ADQ73613401 Refrigerator Water Filter Deliver Superior Performance? Detailed Review,"The **Waterdrop ADQ73613401 Replacement Refrigerator Water Filter** is a product I’ve incorporated into my daily routine, and I have to admit, it’s been a mixed journey. As someone who relies heavily on purified water for cooking, drinking, and making that perfect cup of coffee, having an effective water filter is non-negotiable in my household. This filter, compatible with a variety of LG refrigerator models, comes with some impressive features and a couple of quirks worth mentioning.

**Exceptional Filtration Performance**  
The thing that stood out to me immediately was the advanced filtration technology. With its 100% natural Sri Lankan coconut shell carbon block, this filter claims to reduce harmful impurities like chlorine, odor, and other suspended particles without removing beneficial minerals. In my experience, it really did improve the taste and clarity of my water. I ran a quick test with a glass of tap water versus the filtered water and could immediately tell the difference. Plus, it’s NSF 42 and 372 certified, which gave me peace of mind regarding safety standards. 

[Check Waterdrop ADQ73613401 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b01cc7lsea/)

**Ease of Installation**  
I’ll admit, I’m not particularly handy, and the mere thought of changing a refrigerator filter used to stress me out. But with this filter, installation was surprisingly easy. I followed the instructions included in the packaging and had it up and running in under five minutes—no extra tools required. Its precise design ensures a perfect fit, and I noticed there were no leaks after installation, a relief as I’ve wrestled with poorly fitting filters in the past.

**BPA-Free Materials for Safety**  
Safety is a big concern, especially when it comes to anything interacting with drinking water. Knowing this filter is made from BPA-free, food-grade materials was a selling point for me. It’s backed by NSF 372 certification, confirming that it’s lead-free. Not just marketing fluff—it’s genuinely reassuring when you’ve got kids in the house and use this water for everything from baby formula to rinsing fruits and vegetables.

**Plus Points**  
- Superior coconut shell carbon block.  
- Perfect fit with no leaks.  
- Simple to install, even for beginners.  

**Areas of Improvement**  
- Water flow could be faster.  
- Longevity slightly less than expected for my water's hardness.  

**A Slightly Slow Flow**  
I did notice that the water flow rate was a bit on the slower side. While it’s not a dealbreaker, you do need an extra moment of patience when filling a large container or glass. Running about 2.5 gallons through initially helped reduce spitting from the dispenser, but the reduced flow rate persisted slightly after that.

**Not Long-Lasting for Hard Water**  
Another aspect to consider is the filter’s lifespan. This model is rated for up to six months or 200 gallons, depending on water conditions. In my case, dealing with hard water meant replacing it closer to the five-month mark, which was slightly disappointing. If your tap water is on the softer side, you might get closer to the full six months advertised.

**Competing Products**  
While the product performs well overall, there are other options you might want to compare. For example, filters from brands like EveryDrop and Samsung often feature higher water flow rates but may be more expensive. In terms of affordability and ease of installation, this model has a clear edge. However, if faster water flow or longevity is your top priority, alternatives like the EveryDrop filters might be more suitable for your needs.

**Value for Money**  
I’d say this product scores decently in terms of bang for the buck. Considering the performance, certifications, and materials used, you’re getting a fairly high-quality filter that doesn’t require you to break the bank. However, if your household has higher water consumption or particularly hard water, you may find yourself needing to replace it more frequently, which could offset the cost-effectiveness slightly.

Ever felt overwhelmed by the messy jumble of appliance cords on your kitchen counter? That’s exactly how I felt before I came across the Akeva Cord-black4 Cord Organizer for Kitchen Appliances. This nifty little gadget promised to rescue my countertop from cable clutter, so I decided to give it a try. After spending some quality time with this silicone organizer, I'm here to share my honest experience.

**Design and Materials**

The very first thing I noticed was the sleek and functional design of this cord organizer. Measuring a compact 4.06 x 1.1 x 1.1 inches, it doesn't take up much space but makes a big difference in maintaining kitchen organization. Made of food-grade silicone, it’s not only soft and flexible but also resistant to extreme temperatures. Whether the appliance gets a bit warm during use or I accidentally place it near a cold spot, the material proved to be impressively durable. Plus, its black tone blends seamlessly with most kitchen appliances—styling points earned!

**Usability and Installation**

Installing this gadget was simpler than assembling a sandwich. All I had to do was clean the surface of the appliance, peel off the 3M tape backing, and press it onto the desired spot. The kicker: the adhesive was strong enough to hold firmly after just one minute of pressing. I tried it on different surfaces—wooden blenders, ceramic stand mixers, and even my metal air fryer. Every time, the adhesive stuck flawlessly and stayed put. I once accidentally removed it to reposition, and though it peeled off cleanly, the stickiness wasn’t quite as strong the second time around.

**[Check Akeva Cord-black4 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0clcx6zfb/)**

**Strengths**

The true magic lies in how well this organizer handles different cord types. From thick power cables on my pressure cooker to the thinner wires on my coffee maker, it managed to accommodate all. Its wide surface allowed easy coiling, and it even worked great on curved surfaces like rounded blender bases. These adaptable qualities make it truly universal for any kitchen. Another bonus is its lightweight design—just 4 ounces—but don’t let that fool you. It feels solid, and I could tell it’s built to last.

- Superior 3M adhesive ensures it stays in place.
- Compatible with various appliances: air fryers, mixers, coffee makers, etc.
- Food-grade silicone is safe, durable, and temperature-resistant.
- Works efficiently on both flat and curved surfaces.

**Negatives**

While it boasts many perks, this isn’t a perfect product. For one thing, the adhesive, though strong, can weaken if you need to reapply it. I also noticed that it works best on smooth surfaces; textured or engraved areas might make attachment tricky. Lastly, its compact form means it's best suited for moderate cable lengths—forget about squeezing in giant industrial cords.

- Adhesive loses stickiness if repositioned multiple times.
- Struggles to adhere to heavily textured surfaces.
- Limited capacity for extra-long or overly bulky cords.

**Alternative Offerings**

There are plenty of competing products out there, such as the Command Small Cord Bundlers or the Nordicun Cord Wraps. While the Command bundlers offer similar ease of use, they don’t integrate the same durable silicone material as Akeva’s organizer. Nordicun wraps, on the other hand, can handle longer cords but fall short in the area of adaptability to curved surfaces. I’d say Akeva strikes an excellent balance between usability, durability, and aesthetic appeal. That said, if you’ve got really heavy-duty cords to wrangle, you might want to explore Nordicun as a backup option.

**Bang for the Buck**

The real question: is it worth the investment? Compared to the alternatives, this one offers great durability and stylish practicality for a reasonable price. It feels like a long-term solution rather than a quick fix—and getting something that lasts is always a smart spend in my book. While there are cheaper options, they tend to lack the versatility and adhesive quality you’ll find here. This makes the organizer a practical and affordable choice for most households.

- The advanced formula is not only effective in cleaning but also leaves behind a layer of Scotchgard protection. This feature strikes me as particularly helpful for maintaining the longevity of my carpets.  
- The triple-action cleaning aspect genuinely removes odors, which was evident after I cleaned the rugs in my pet area. Even the toughest, most stubborn smells were noticeably gone after a single pass.  
- A generous 52-ounce bottle size ensures multiple uses, especially helpful if you're working on large carpeted spaces.  

**Performance Under Daily Use**  

Using this product daily or even weekly, I could see a difference in how my carpets began to look brighter and fresher. Stains that had become part of the fabric’s personality—spilled coffee, messy craft paints, and even paw prints—were no match for the cleaning power of this formula. I combined it with a high-quality carpet extractor as recommended, which intensified the results. Even more convenient was its ability to protect carpets in the long term; the Scotchgard layer provided a noticeable defense against dirt reattachment.  

**Shortcomings**  

- I noticed that the formula can leave a small, invisible residue if over-applied. While it's not visibly noticeable, it may require an extra rinse cycle to address this issue.  
- If you’re using it with a smaller extractor or manually attempting to shampoo the carpet, you may find the consistency of the solution slightly difficult to dilute properly.   

**Competitive Options**  

When it comes to alternative carpet cleaners, there are products like the Hoover AH30035 Carpet Cleaning Detergent or the Resolve Pet Expert Deep Stain Carpet Cleaner. While both these options are great in their own rights—for example, Hoover boasts an allergen-removal formula and Resolve takes a strong stance on tackling pet-specific messes—they fell short on providing an all-in-one solution like Scotchgard protection. That’s where the BISSELL cleaner stole the show; it’s a complete package that doesn’t just clean but actively protects your investment. On the flip side, though, the competitors are often easier to use manually, which might be worth considering if you don’t own a compatible extractor.  

**Affordable Quality**  

Speaking of price vs. value, it’s tough to overlook what this product brings to the table. Sure, it might seem like a premium option at a glance, especially compared to competitors that sometimes have lower upfront costs. However, when you factor in features like odor neutralization, Scotchgard defense, and the depth of cleaning, it’s clear this cleaner provides excellent bang for the buck. If you’re someone who prioritizes long-term savings by keeping your carpets looking fresh rather than replacing them, this product is a smart spending choice.

Shave on the 29th was with a GWS blade on its 3rd use and about 9 days of beard growth. It handled the job really well—comfortable shave, no nicks, no tugs.

The next shave was today. I had skipped yesterday since I had already shaved in the evening of the 29th. Used the GWS again on its 4th use. No nicks or cuts this time either, and the shave felt smooth overall. That said, the blade had clearly started to dull—I noticed some hair left around the moustache area, and within just 6 hours I could already see visible stubble on my chin.

As for the soap, I bloomed it slightly today (_something I hadn’t needed before_).

I have chronic bad breath almost 10 years since college na. Hindi naman ako pabaya sa sarili ko and Im totally hygienic. Its just sad that I suffer from this so called bad breath. To tell u honestly 2-3x a day po ako nagbabrush ng ngipin. First, I do water flossing and then I brush my teeth about 5 mins then after that I scrape my tongue using metal tongue scraper then gargling using orahex and then lastly I do the manual flossing. 5 years na po na ganito everyday ginagawa ko but still the bad breath is coming right after I eat Down to my throat and when I sneeze ambaho.
Nakakawala ng confidence. Its so unfair lang kase I know many ppl na kahit magbrush lang sila once a day hindi sila nagkakabad breath and my mga pulubi na hindi naman mabaho ang hininga. Im so tired of this. Seeing people avoiding me and smiling pag nag nagsasalita ako, napakasakit. Well im totally aware of it.
I am in medical field pa naman and feeling nila hindi ako hygienic. Mas hygienic pa nga ako sa kanila just by knowing them if they only know. Im very very hygienic person compared to them.
Im very tired guys. Nagawa ko na lahat. I even went to a doctor to check if my ulcer ako and there was none. I am very healthy human being. I dont smoke, I dont drink alcohol, once in a blue moon lang ako uminom ng sodas and I dont drink coffee but still.
There were times na i had suicidal thoughts na and sobrang baba na ng self confidence ko na ayaw ko nang lumabas sa bahay. I just want to end this thing.

So I propose for every 50/50 players lost for a C6 5\* character, they get 1 token.  3 tokens to trade for a character alternate costume of the player's choice in a newly created shop.

The costumes can be collaboration costumes which the devs designed for characters over the entire game, like Noelle's KFC costume, or Yae's genshin music anniversary costume, or Clorinde/Sigweinne's Luckin Coffee costumes.

So this change wouldn't affect any power level at all, players wouldn't have any worries about game getting harder or have OCD seeing their characters not being maxed. It also helps alleviate sadness when players lose to their nth+7 Qiqi.

She had many open chats with coworkers and she showed me discussions. Long story short. That mean manager belittled her in a call, didn't call her stupid but implied. He said she cannot understand anything and she should at least read and understand what she is reading in the emails. And many other mean things.

1n4rtdc,https://youtu.be/xvouEgAEcAo,3 Very Scary TRUE Antique Shop Horror Stories,"# ""Coins from the Dead"":

I used to stop by that old antique shop whenever I passed through north Florida. It sat right off the interstate, tucked among some trees, with a sign that read ""Wayside Antiques"" in faded red letters. The place always had a mix of dusty furniture, old coins, and jewelry that caught my eye. Tom and Ellen, the couple who ran it, were kind folks in their sixties, always ready with a story about where each piece came from. I'd been going there for months, picking up small items for my home.

That day in late June, I pulled into the gravel lot around closing time. The door bell jingled as I stepped inside, and the air smelled of polished wood and old paper. Ellen looked up from behind the counter, wiping her hands on her apron. ""Hey there, you're just in time. We're about to lock up, but take a look around.""

""Thanks, Ellen,"" I said, smiling. ""I'm after some silver today. Anything new?""

She pointed to a glass case near the back. ""Tom just brought in a set of coins from an estate sale. Real beauties, from the 1800s. Go on, have a peek.""

I wandered over, peering at the shiny pieces under the dim lights. The shop was quiet, just the tick of a grandfather clock in the corner. Tom came out from the storage room, carrying a box. He was a sturdy man with gray hair and a mustache, always wearing suspenders. ""Finding what you need?"" he asked, setting the box down.

""Yeah, these coins are nice. How much for the lot?"" I replied.

We haggled a bit, like usual. ""I'll give you a deal, say fifty for the set,"" Tom said. ""But don't tell Ellen I went soft.""

Ellen laughed from the counter. ""I heard that. Make it sixty, or we'll starve.""

I chuckled and agreed on fifty-five. As I paid, the bell jingled again. A man walked in, tall and lean, with dark hair slicked back and a jacket that seemed too heavy for the heat. He had sharp eyes that scanned the room quick, like he was measuring everything. ""Evening,"" he muttered, not looking at us directly.

""Welcome,"" Ellen said politely. ""We're closing soon, but feel free to browse.""

The man nodded and moved toward the jewelry display. Something about him felt off. He didn't ask questions like most customers. Instead, he picked up a necklace, turned it over, then put it back without a word. I caught Tom glancing at Ellen, a small frown on his face.

""You looking for something specific?"" Tom asked, trying to sound casual.

The man paused, then said, ""Just checking values. You got a safe for the good stuff?""

Tom shifted his weight. ""We keep some in back, but nothing on display right now.""

The man smiled thin, like it didn't reach his eyes. ""Smart. Lots of thieves around. Ever had trouble?""

Ellen cleared her throat. ""Not here. We know our regulars.""

I finished paying and pocketed the coins, feeling uneasy. The man kept staring at the cases, his fingers tapping the glass. ""Nice place,"" he said finally. ""I'll come back tomorrow.""

He left without buying anything, the door jingling behind him. Tom locked it right after. ""Odd fellow,"" he said, shaking his head.

""Yeah,"" I agreed. ""Seemed too interested in your safe.""

Ellen waved it off. ""Probably just curious. Drive safe now.""

I got in my car and headed home, about twenty minutes away. But that night, I couldn't shake the feeling. The man's questions replayed in my mind. What if he was scouting the place?

The next morning, I turned on the radio while making coffee. A news bulletin came on: ""Double homicide at Wayside Antiques in Marion County. Owners found dead in their shop. Authorities suspect robbery.""

My hands went cold on the mug. I drove back there fast, heart racing the whole way. Police tape blocked the lot, and officers milled around. I parked across the road and walked up to a deputy. ""What happened? I was there yesterday.""

He looked me over. ""Can't say much, but it's bad. You know them?""

""Regular customer,"" I said. ""Saw a strange guy come in late.""

The deputy took my statement. Later, I learned the details from a friend in town who knew one of the investigators. Tom and Ellen had been surprised after closing. The killer—or killers—had handcuffed them to the floor safe in the back room, taped their mouths shut, and shot them point-blank with a small gun. Jewelry and collectibles worth hundreds of thousands gone. No forced entry, like they knew exactly what to take.

I described the man to the police: tall, dark hair, jacket. They nodded, said it matched a lead they had on a professional thief from out of state. But weeks passed, and nothing. I started noticing things. A car parked down my street one evening, engine running, lights off. I peered out the window, but it drove away slow.

Then, a phone call late at night. No voice, just breathing, then click. I told myself it was nothing, but sleep didn't come easy. What if that man thought I recognized him? What if he saw me talking to Tom about the safe?

One afternoon, I went back to the shop—now closed, boards on the windows. I don't know why; maybe to pay respects. The gravel crunched under my feet as I walked around back, where Tom and Ellen had lived in a small house attached. The door to the shop hung slightly open, wind pushing it. Or was it wind?

I pushed it wider, stepping inside. The place was a mess from the investigation: drawers pulled out, fingerprint dust everywhere. The grandfather clock still ticked, slow and steady. I moved to the back room, where the safe sat bolted to the floor. Scratches on the metal, like from handcuffs scraping.

A noise—footsteps? I turned sharp, but the room was empty. ""Hello?"" I called, voice echoing.

No answer. I backed out, pulse quick in my ears. As I reached the front, the bell jingled. I spun around. No one. But the door swung shut on its own.

That night, another call. This time, a voice, low and calm: ""You saw too much.""

I hung up, locked every door, checked every window. Who was it? The man from the shop? Police said they had suspects, one in Texas, one on the run. But what if he was closer?

Days blurred. I avoided driving alone, kept lights on. Then, a knock at my door one evening. I looked through the peephole—a man in a uniform, badge shining. ""Police,"" he said. ""About your statement.""

I opened it careful. He was young, notebook in hand. ""We think the suspect's been spotted nearby. Tall guy, dark hair. You sure about the description?""

""Yes,"" I said, letting him in. We sat at the table, and I retold the story. He nodded, writing notes. ""Good. This helps.""

As he stood to leave, his jacket sleeve rode up. A tattoo on his wrist—same as one I'd glimpsed on the strange man in the shop.

""Wait,"" I said, standing. ""Who are you really?""

He smiled that thin smile. ""Just checking values.""

I lunged for the phone, but he was faster, grabbing my arm. ""You shouldn't have come back to the shop.""

We struggled, knocking over a lamp. I yelled for help, but the neighborhood was quiet. He pushed me against the wall, hand over my mouth like tape. ""Quiet now.""

In that moment, I remembered the coins in my pocket from the shop. I pulled them out, swung hard, catching him in the eye. He staggered back, cursing soft. I ran for the door, screaming.

Neighbors heard, called the real police. They arrived quick, found him trying to slip away. It was him—Robert, the thief they'd been hunting. He'd come for me, thinking I had more details on the loot or could identify him clear.

He got arrested, along with his partner. Turns out, he'd visited the shop before, posing as a buyer, just like I saw. The police recovered some items in Las Vegas, fenced to a financier.

I still drive by that interstate sometimes, but I never stop. The shop's gone now, torn down. But I keep those coins on my shelf, a reminder of how close I came. And sometimes, when the phone rings late, I let it go to voicemail. Just in case.





# ""The Treasure"":

I remember the first time I noticed something off about Angel. I had been working at The Treasure Hunter for about two years by then, helping Milton sort through old clocks, dusty vases, and silverware sets that people brought in hoping for a big payout. The shop sat on a quiet corner in Elizabeth City, with big windows that let in light on the displays of vintage jewelry and faded photographs in ornate frames. Milton was the kind of boss who treated everyone like family—he'd share stories about each item's history while we polished them, his voice steady and warm.

Angel started coming around more after they got married in 2012. She was good at arranging the shelves, making everything look inviting. But one afternoon in early 2018, I saw her talking to this guy named Isaac at the back of the store. He was tall, with a calm face, saying he was looking for an old pocket watch for his collection. Angel laughed a little too loud at his jokes, touching his arm as she showed him a brass one from the 1800s. ""This one's special,"" she said, her voice low. ""It keeps perfect time, no matter what."" Isaac smiled and replied, ""I like things that last."" Milton was out front with a customer, so he didn't see, but it stuck with me—the way their eyes lingered.

Days turned into weeks, and Isaac kept showing up. He'd browse the antique guns or the porcelain dolls, but he always ended up chatting with Angel. Once, I overheard them near the storage room. ""He's always watching,"" Angel whispered. ""I feel trapped here."" Isaac leaned in close. ""You deserve better. Tell me what you need."" I pretended to dust a shelf nearby, but my hands shook a bit. It felt wrong, like they were sharing secrets right under the roof of Milton's business.

Milton started changing too. He looked tired, his usual cheer gone. One evening after closing, as we locked up the glass cases filled with gold rings and old coins, he confided in me. ""Something's not right with Angel,"" he said, his voice quiet. ""I think she's seeing someone. Found messages on her phone."" I didn't know what to say. ""Who?"" I asked. He shook his head. ""Some therapist guy. Isaac something. I confronted him, told him to stay away."" Milton's eyes were hard then, like he'd fight for what was his. We stood there among the shadows of the tall cabinets holding antique lamps and books, and I felt a knot in my gut.

The shop began to feel different after that. Items would go missing—small things, like a silver locket or a pair of earrings. Milton blamed forgetful customers, but I wondered. Angel acted sweeter around him, bringing him coffee in a thermos, saying, ""You work too hard, honey. Let me handle the back inventory."" But when he wasn't looking, she'd slip out for ""errands."" One day, Isaac came in again, pretending to appraise a vintage clock. Angel pulled him aside. I caught snippets: ""He won't let go,"" she said. ""We have to do something."" Isaac murmured, ""I'll take care of it. For us."" My pulse quickened; I backed away, knocking over a stack of old plates. They shattered on the floor, and Angel glared at me. ""Be careful,"" she snapped. ""Those were worth something.""

Nights at home, I couldn't sleep, replaying it all. The shop's creaks and the way the mannequins in old dresses seemed to watch from the corners—it got under my skin. I started staying late, organizing the cluttered basement where we kept overflow stock: trunks full of yellowed letters, rusted tools, and forgotten heirlooms. One evening, I found a note tucked in a drawer, in Angel's handwriting: ""Meet at 8. Can't wait anymore."" It was dated the day before. I shoved it in my pocket, heart racing. Should I tell Milton? What if I was wrong?

Then came August 2, 2018. I was closing the shop alone—Milton had gone home early, saying he felt off. The phone rang just as I flipped the sign to ""Closed."" It was Angel, her voice shaky. ""Come quick. There's been a break-in at the house. Milton... he's hurt bad."" I dropped everything and drove over, the streets blurring. When I arrived, the front door was ajar, lights on inside. Angel sat on the porch steps, covered in blood, her hands trembling. ""A man broke in,"" she sobbed. ""Masked, demanding money from the shop. He attacked us.""

I rushed inside. The living room was a mess—furniture overturned, drawers pulled out. In the bathroom, Milton lay face down, hands bound with tape, not moving. Blood pooled around his head. I knelt, checking for a pulse, but nothing. His neck had bruises, like someone had squeezed the life out. ""Call the police,"" I yelled to Angel. She nodded, dialing with bloody fingers. Sirens wailed soon after.

The cops arrived, taking statements. Angel repeated her story: ""He screamed, 'Give me all your money!' He knew about the shop, the gold we buy."" But details didn't add up—the back door unlocked, no forced entry. I mentioned Isaac to the detectives, the visits, the whispers. ""She was seeing him,"" I said. They nodded, jotting notes.

Days blurred into investigation. I kept the shop open, but customers asked about Milton, their faces pitying. Items felt tainted now, like each antique held a dark secret. Then, the arrests came on August 21. Angel and Isaac, charged with murder. Turns out, they'd planned it—Angel left a key out, Isaac snuck in, strangled Milton in a chokehold while Angel staged her own injuries. She wanted freedom, he wanted her. A friend of Isaac's recorded him confessing: ""I did it for love. She said he'd never let her go.""

In court, years later, Angel sat stone-faced as evidence piled up: the affair texts, the note I found, witness accounts from the shop. She got life without parole in 2021. Isaac took a plea, twenty years. The shop closed after that; I couldn't bear the memories.

Even now, walking past empty antique stores, I wonder about the stories behind each piece. But mostly, I remember Milton's trusting smile, and how betrayal can hide in plain sight, waiting to strike.





# ""The Newport Hit"":

I started working at that little antique shop in Newport back in the summer of 1972 because I needed extra cash for school. Mr. Eisner hired me on the spot after I walked in looking for a job. He was a gruff guy in his fifties, with a thick mustache and eyes that always seemed to scan the room like he expected trouble. The shop was crammed with old furniture, dusty clocks, porcelain figures, and glass cases full of jewelry from who knows where. I spent most days polishing items or arranging shelves, and Mr. Eisner handled the customers. He had connections, people whispered—ties to the rough crowd that ran the clubs and casinos around town. But to me, he was just the boss who paid on time and let me take breaks when it was slow.

That Tuesday morning, July 30, felt ordinary at first. I arrived around nine, unlocked the back door with the key he gave me, and started sorting a new shipment of vases in the storage room. The air smelled like old wood and polish, and the only sounds were the tick of a grandfather clock up front and the occasional car passing on the street. Mr. Eisner showed up about half an hour later, carrying a paper bag with coffee and donuts from the diner down the block.

""Morning, kid,"" he said, setting the bag on the counter. His voice was low, like always, but he looked tired, bags under his eyes. ""Help yourself. Slow day ahead, I think.""

""Thanks, Mr. Eisner,"" I replied, grabbing a donut. ""You want me to finish those vases first or dust the front?""

""Vases can wait. Check the jewelry case—make sure nothing's out of place. Had a couple of shady types in yesterday asking about prices.""

I nodded and got to work. We chatted a bit while I wiped down the glass. He told me about a rare pocket watch he'd picked up cheap at an estate sale, how it might fetch a good price from the right buyer. ""You gotta know who to trust in this business,"" he said, lighting a cigarette. ""Not everyone plays fair.""

Around noon, things picked up. A few customers came in—an old lady buying a lamp, a man browsing books. Mr. Eisner haggled with them like a pro, always closing the deal with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. After they left, the shop went quiet again. I headed to the back to eat my sandwich, sitting on a crate amid stacks of crates and forgotten trinkets. The storage room was dim, lit by a single bulb, and the walls were lined with mirrors and paintings that stared back at you funny if you looked too long.

I was halfway through my lunch when I heard the front bell jingle. Footsteps followed, heavy ones, not the light shuffle of a regular shopper. Then voices—Mr. Eisner's and another man's, deep and angry.

""You owe us, Sammy,"" the stranger said. ""The boss ain't patient anymore. That last shipment? You skimmed off the top.""

""I didn't skim nothing,"" Mr. Eisner shot back, his tone sharp but steady. ""Tell him it's all there. I got records.""

""Records? We don't care about your papers. You think you're slick, fencing through this dump? Time's up.""

I froze, sandwich in hand. Fencing? I'd heard rumors about Mr. Eisner dealing in stolen goods, but I never asked questions. The argument heated up, voices rising. I crept to the door that separated the back from the front, cracking it just enough to peek through. Mr. Eisner stood behind the counter, face red, while the other guy—a big man in a dark coat, hat pulled low—loomed over him. I couldn't see his face clearly from the angle, just the side, scarred cheek and all.

""Pay up now, or it's over,"" the man growled, pulling something from his pocket. Metal glinted—a gun.

My breath caught. I should've run out the back, but my legs wouldn't move. Mr. Eisner raised his hands. ""Wait, let's talk. I can get the money by Friday. Just give me—""

The shot cracked like thunder, echoing off the walls. Mr. Eisner jerked back, clutching his chest, blood blooming on his shirt. He gasped, stumbling against a shelf, knocking over a vase that shattered on the floor.

""No!"" I whispered to myself, heart racing so hard it hurt. The man fired again, then a third time, each blast making me flinch. Mr. Eisner slumped to the ground, eyes wide, not moving.

The killer stood there a moment, breathing heavy, then started rummaging through the counter drawers. He muttered something I couldn't hear, pocketing cash and a few small items from the jewelry case. My mind screamed to hide. I backed away slowly, careful not to make noise, and ducked behind a tall armoire in the corner. The wood creaked under my weight, and I held my breath, praying he wouldn't come back here.

Footsteps approached the door. It swung open with a slow creak, and light spilled in. I pressed against the wall, peeking through a tiny gap in the armoire's carving. He scanned the room, gun still in hand, his shadow stretching long across the floor. Something clattered—a box he kicked over. He paused, head tilting like he heard something. Me? My pulse thundered in my ears.

""Who's there?"" he called out, voice cold. ""Come out, or I'll find you.""

I bit my lip to keep quiet, sweat trickling down my back. He stepped closer, shoving aside a stack of chairs. The armoire was next. I imagined him yanking it open, the gun pointing right at me. Seconds stretched forever. A clock somewhere ticked louder, mocking the silence.

Then, a car horn blared outside. He cursed under his breath—not a rough word, but angry—and turned back. ""Lucky,"" he muttered, retreating to the front. The bell jingled again, and he was gone.

I waited what felt like hours, shaking, listening for any sound. Finally, I crept out, legs wobbly. The storage room looked the same, but the front... Blood pooled under Mr. Eisner, his face pale, eyes staring blank at the ceiling. Shards of glass sparkled in the mess. I gagged, turning away, and grabbed the phone with trembling hands to call the police.

They arrived fast, lights flashing, asking questions I could barely answer. I told them what I heard, described the man as best I could—tall, scarred, dark coat—but I hadn't seen his full face. The cops nodded, took notes, mentioned Mr. Eisner's ties to the mob. ""Probably a hit,"" one said. ""We'll look into it.""

Days turned to weeks, then months. The shop closed, boarded up. I quit antiques altogether, moved away from Newport's seedy streets. But nights, I still hear those shots, see that shadow in my dreams. The case went cold—Kentucky State Police took over, but no arrests. Whoever did it is still out there, maybe watching, waiting if I say too much. Sometimes, I wonder if he knew I was there, hiding, and let me live on purpose.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Elena Rybakina vs. Marketa Vondrousova: A US Open Showdown of Power vs. Puzzle**

The US Open’s fourth-round clash between Elena Rybakina and Marketa Vondrousova is a battle of contrasting styles, with Rybakina’s thunderous serves clashing against Vondrousova’s tactical wizardry. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this match might leave you wondering if your TV is on mute—or if Rybakina just vaporized the net with a serve.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Foregone Conclusion?

The bookmakers aren’t leaving much room for suspense. Rybakina is the overwhelming favorite at decimal odds of **1.4 (implied probability \~71.4%)**, while Vondrousova sits at **\~3.0 (33.3%)**. Even the spread (-3.5 games) suggests Rybakina’s dominance. But let’s not let the numbers dull the drama. After all, this is tennis, where upsets are as common as a croissant at a bagel brunch.

---

### Recent Form: Rybakina’s “I’m Not Here to Make Friends” Streak

Rybakina has been a machine this tournament, steamrolling opponents with the efficiency of a Roomba on a coffee table. Her 6-1, 6-2 dismantling of Emma Raducanu in the third round? A masterclass in efficiency. She dropped just three games across two matches, including a third-round victory that took **60 minutes**—long enough to microwave dinner, eat it, and start a second round of laundry.

Vondrousova, meanwhile, has been a grittier story. Her third-round win over Jasmine Paolini required a tiebreak and a post-match sigh that could be heard across New York. Still, she’s proven she can beat elite players—this year’s wins over Aryna Sabalenka and Madison Keys are no small feat. But her **7-16 career record against top-10 players on hard courts** is like a GPS that occasionally gets lost in a parking lot.

---

### Head-to-Head: Rybakina’s One-and-Done Edge

The only previous meeting between these two—a 2023 Italian Open romp by Rybakina—was so decisive it’s already being referenced in betting circles as “The Atomic Serve Incident.” Both players have since evolved, but Rybakina’s first-strike game (read: a 133mph

I (27F) was pulling out of a plaza where I get my usual coffee. A van trying to turn into the plaza wasnt able to fit without me backing up or moving forwards so I took the opportunity to get out into the farthest right lane so he can turn in. Apparently the driver behind him didnt like that cuz i heard a lot of honks while turning but I thought nothing of it at first....until i saw some middle aged lady get out of her car and walk towards mine. 

Instantly I locked my doors and then watched as she punched the body of my car a couple times. As she walked away I (admittedly) flipped her off for trynna damage my property. After that she cut the car in the other lane to get next to me and starting hurling insults at me telling me to come outside and fight her.  While doing so she started throwing coins at my car??? I couldnt hear what she was saying but I did pretend to get my phone and record her. She immediately looked offended and started to do the same.

After all that nonsense she cut in front of me, waited at the green light, and then sped off. It was the wildest couple of minutes I've ever experienced, my hands were shaking by the end of it!  Ive been replaying the situation in my head on what I could have done differently in the situation but everything went by so fast!

Somehow after all that my car took 0 damage. Not a single scratch. So i guess its a win in my books. ",1,1756637599.0,RoadRage,0,1.0,False

i think that basically implies that the judge does not mind all the stuff the Proseuctors do, he's probably gotten used to it in his years as a judge and just accepts it for what it is, and i honestly find it kinda beautiful, and that also does say that Phoenix and the other defense Attorneys don't really object to the harm the prosecutors use in court like Fransiska whippin people, godot's coffee and blackquill's sword

Not the peaceful kind, but the one that hums beneath the noise of laughter, footsteps, and shopping carts. It’s the day the world dresses up—literally and figuratively—and parades its happiness in front of you.

You step out, maybe just to breathe, maybe to forget. But the mall greets you like a stage, and you’re not part of the cast. Children dart past you, their giggles like wind chimes—pure, unfiltered joy. You catch a glimpse of a mother in a flowing dress, her smile soft, her eyes tired but loved. You don’t need to see the man beside her to know he’s the kind who remembers her favorite coffee and pays for it without blinking.

Then there’s the father at the counter. No hesitation. Just a swipe of the card, a nod to the cashier, and a hand on his son’s shoulder. That simple gesture says everything: “I’ve got you.”

And you—standing there with your hands in your pockets—feel like a ghost in someone else’s dream. Not angry. Just... hollow. Because Sunday isn’t just a day. It’s a mirror. And in it, you see the family you never had. The kind of love that wasn’t yours to grow up with. The kind of security that feels like fiction.

You walk past them all, not bitter, just bruised. Because no one sees the weight you carry. No one knows that behind your quiet eyes is a heart that wonders what it would’ve been like to be the kid with the giggle, the mother with the dress, the father with the card.

A DC Narrative of Genius, Inheritance, and Redemption

# Prologue: The Last Days of Ordinary Light

Before Gotham was a city shadowed and illuminated by the brilliance and peril of invention, before the rise of caped crusaders and their foes, there was a world trembling on the cusp of war and innovation. In 1914, in Smallville, Kansas, a mind unlike any other was born—Edgar Loomis Bulb, who would become legend as the Idea Man.

Edgar’s intellect was a singularity—his IQ eclipsed 300, and his curiosity spanned disciplines from mechanical engineering to radio telegraphy, and the mysterious art of mathematical prognostication. The world was unprepared for such a mind, but history is rarely made by those who wait for invitation.

At twenty-three, Edgar left behind the fields and clouds of Smallville. Destiny drew him to Gotham City, New Jersey, a crucible of industry on the brink of modernity. There, the currents of invention and ambition swept him into the heart of a city—and a century—about to change.

# The Meeting of Titans

Edgar’s inventions—clockwork automata, self-writing mechanical scribes, radio-linked mind-maps—garnered whispers and wonder among Gotham’s scientific and social elite. At a World’s Scientific Congress, fate entwined Edgar’s path with that of Queen Hippolyta of the Amazons—Warrior, monarch, and, in secret, the mother of Wonder Woman.

Hippolyta, wary of the storm gathering over Europe, recognized in Edgar a rare soul: eccentric, yes, but driven by curiosity and justice. Their alliance was tested almost at once: blueprints for the world’s first programmable Analytical Engine were stolen from Wayne Enterprises. The only clue was a wax seal stamped with a double eagle and a staring eye.

Hippolyta suspected a new threat—the shadowy Doctor Bruno Gregor Null, a Prussian intellect who saw the world as his laboratory and war as his experiment. Null’s agents pillaged laboratories and vanished scientists. Edgar’s own workshop was attacked, but his mechanical guardians—clockwork wasps and a “Neurocognitive Reflector”—fought off the intruders.

Confronted with the consequences of genius, Edgar turned to Hippolyta. Together, they declared, “The greatest weapon is not the sharpest blade, but the clearest mind.”

# The March of War

As the Great War began, Null’s stolen Analytical Engine manipulated the tides of battle with chilling precision. Edgar and Hippolyta’s alliance fought in secret, disrupting Null’s network of spies and saboteurs across Gotham, London, and Vienna.

But the cost was high. Edgar’s faith in progress was shaken, Hippolyta’s compassion tested. The war of minds became a duel in Vienna’s snowbound heart. Null, intent on unleashing a city-wide mindwave, was foiled by Edgar and Hippolyta’s gambit—paradoxes and riddles overloaded the Engine, and Null vanished, defeated but unbroken.

# Shattered Circuits: The Roaring Twenties

The war’s thunder faded. Gotham entered a new era—jazz, silent screens, skyscrapers. Edgar, ever vigilant, found kinship with Alan Scott, the Green Lantern, whose emerald fire mirrored the inspiration that drives invention.

But Null survived, returning with a vengeance: blackouts, stolen genius, and the Cognition Engine Redux—capable of transferring intellect from the living to the dead. Solomon Grundy, transformed into Null’s pawn, wandered Gotham, haunted by alien memories. Edgar, Alan, and Grundy confronted Null in the ruins of Gotham’s botanical gardens.

In the end, Grundy’s reclaimed sorrow shattered the Engine. Null’s shadow receded, and the city’s intellect was restored. Edgar, Alan, and Grundy stood together at dawn, guardians not only of progress, but of mercy.

# Nocturne Ultimatum: The Twenties’ Twilight

Peace in Gotham was always fragile. Edgar, now a father, and his wife Nora celebrated their son Oliver—hope incarnate. Yet Dr. Null returned once more, orchestrating the kidnapping of Oliver, demanding the reconstruction of the Cognition Engine.

Edgar, Nora, Alan, Ted Grant, and Dinah Drake uncovered Null’s plot—an existential threat, not just to Gotham, but to the soul of invention. In the catacombs beneath the city, Edgar deployed a “Mercy Circuit,” a device of compassion masquerading as the Engine. Null’s automata fell to the unity and ingenuity of Gotham’s guardians.

Oliver was saved, hope rekindled, and Null’s legacy became a whisper—a lesson that intellect divorced from compassion is ruinous.

# Inheritance, Sacrifice, and the Coffin’s Price: The Thirties

Gotham, 1930. Edgar, now father to three, balanced invention and parenthood. His ambitions turned away from weapons: an ambulance to cut traffic, lanterns to guide the lost, a “temporal triage preservation coffin” to grant dying patients time to find a cure.

During a hospital demonstration, sabotage by a desperate technician left Edgar trapped in his own machine—suspended between life and death. Gotham watched as his family and allies kept vigil. The city learned new lessons: that progress is not found in miracles, but in perseverance and sacrifice.

After a month, Edgar’s legacy was not one of glory, but of caution and hope. Nora and their children continued his work—not in secret, but for the city, building compassion into every circuit.

# Legacy of the Bulb: Gotham's Forgotten Genius

Decades passed. The legend of the Idea Man faded into myth, his blueprints confounding minds long after his disappearance. Until, in a modern Gotham, a museum break-in revealed a preserved Edgar—awakened from a self-imposed slumber.

Bulb’s adjustment was swift. Adopting the moniker “Idea Man” once more, he created the Bulb IQ Pin—a device that could siphon intellect. Batman intervened, and with the help of the Riddler, foiled Bulb’s and later, Professor Animus’s, schemes to enslave Gotham’s minds.

The true peril was not just in genius, but in its worship. Animus, obsessed with legacy and power, was undone not by might, but by the hubris of believing himself untouchable. The city dawned anew, Edgar’s family at his side, the legend now one of wisdom and humility.

# Twilight of the Mind: The Enduring Light

As Edgar passed, Gotham’s story continued. His granddaughter, Sarah Leanne Bulb, became a neuroscientist and custodian of the Bulb notebooks. The rise of the Tenebrous, a syndicate seeking to overwrite Gotham’s brightest minds, forced Sarah and Batman to unite.

Null, a new adversary, wielded technology that could erase personality itself. Sarah’s creation, the “Light Key,” restored those lost to Null’s machinations, and the syndicate was defeated—proved vulnerable to compassion and ingenuity.

Sarah founded the Bulb Foundation, dedicated to ethical inspiration, and Gotham thrived, the legend of the Idea Man now a lesson in humility, not hubris.

# The Afterglow Protocol: A New Dawn

In the aftermath, the city faced one final test—Edgar’s failsafe, the Afterglow Protocol, a gauntlet designed to ensure his legacy would not be abused. Sarah, Batman, and Gotham’s best minds solved riddles and trials set by SIBYL, a synthetic intelligence forged from Bulb’s code.

The ordeal revealed the true inheritance: genius is a flame, its value in whom it illuminates, not in how it dominates. Gotham’s thinkers emerged wiser, and Sarah’s leadership guided the city toward a future where intellect is shared, not hoarded.

# Epilogue: The Lantern Endures

Through every era—war and peace, crisis and renewal—Gotham’s soul was shaped by those who bore the light. Inventions rose and fell, guardians passed the torch, and the legend of Edgar Loomis Bulb became not just a caution, but a hope.

In classrooms and coffee shops, in laboratories and alleyways, Gotham remembered: the brightest ideas are shared, the truest guardians lead by mercy, and the future is lit not by the sharpest minds alone, but by the courage to serve, to remember, and to inspire.

And so, the story continues, in every lantern lit, every mind unbowed, every vow whispered against the closing dark.

Let’s talk about something that’s been on my mind lately—**wasting time!** 😩 You know the drill: scrolling through endless social media feeds, binge-watching shows instead of putting your ideas into action, or getting stuck in the cycle of overthinking. Honestly, it’s exhausting. 

But what if I told you there are **faceless growth strategies** that can actually make you money? Yeah, no face, no fear! Just results before the AI rush makes it all mainstream! 💰

I mean, who doesn’t want to work smarter, not harder? Here's how we can flip the script and get those coins rolling in without the hustle and bustle of being in the limelight!

### Here’s the scoop:

1. **Ad Profit Wizardry**: 
   - You don’t need to be a marketing guru to run ads. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram let you set up ads that do the selling while you grab a coffee. ☕️ Just target your ideal customers, and let the algorithm work its magic!

2. **Affiliate Marketing Goldmine**:
   - Find a niche you love (e.g., tech gadgets, fitness gear) and promote products. You don’t have to show your face—just share your thoughts, use those afiliates smartly, and cash in! 🔥 For some extra guidance, check out this **[helpful guide](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals)** 

3. **Automate Content Creation**: 
   - AI tools are seriously like having an army of little helpers at your beck and call. You create your brand voice, and let AI handle the rest. No more staring at a blank page! 

4. **Anonymous E-commerce**: 
   - Dropshipping and print-on-demand makes it easy to run an online store without the hassle of inventory. You can keep everything faceless. Just think about it—create a store, set up your products, and boom, let the sales come rolling in. 🛍️

5. **Build Passive Income Streams**: 
   - Have a mini digital product (eBook, online course) that aligns with what you’re passionate about? Put it up for sale, and as people buy, watch those dollars flow in while you’re chilling on the couch! 😌

### So, what's holding you back?

We all have those momentary second guesses: “What if it doesn’t work?” or “I’m not cut out for this.” But isn’t that the fear that keeps so many of us stuck? You owe it to yourself to try!

Because here’s the vibe: with any of these strategies, the real win comes from being consistent and not being afraid to pivot when something isn’t working. Celebrate those little wins too—I mean, who doesn’t want to side-hustle their way to financial freedom, right?!

Remember, the AI wave is coming, and it’s gonna push the market! So let's get ahead of the curve and **not wait until it’s too late**. 😏 

Can’t wait to hear your thoughts, stories or struggles with these ideas. Are you already diving into any of these strategies? Let's chat! 💬",1,1756636423.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1n4rbd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1n4rbd6/confused_forearms_hurting_even_with_extra_recovery/,Confused... Forearms hurting even with extra recovery...,"Hi All,

TL;DR Will 9 days off upper body gym help my forearms recover? Will I lose strength?

**I've been consistently training for several months**, I train Mon-Wed & Friday, and always take thursday and the weekends off. I'm in really good shape, likely sub 8% body fat and am eating a lot (three meals plus a double scoop shake this week due to this forearm issue). Normally I recover well, I normally sleep 6-7 hrs. This weekend I slept 9 hours to see if it would help recover my forearms, but it did nothing, I also took an extra electrolyte tablet in case I was low, again no impact.

**This week my forearms have been hurting similar to DOMS** however this is super confusing as I thought that only happens if you're new to training or have take time off (I was getting this in march but it went as soon as I was consistently training). **I've tried stretching, massaging etc nothing helps.** 

It's not too bothersome, however, **I don't want it to impact my workouts.** I'm thinking to take next week off from upper body completely and train legs only (cutting out any exercises that need arms like dumbbell lunges, maybe towards the end of the week focus on forearms if they've recovered so that I can get more stregnth for my upper body workouts which rely on my forearms. I took two weeks off when I hit a plataeu and it destroyed my progress, so **my hope is if I train legs only and just take one week off anything that involved my arms, my forearms will be recovered.**

**My usual split:**

* Mon - Back - heavy sets of pull ups weighted, finsher single arm: seated rows, lat pull down
* Tues - Chest - incline dumbbells, cables, abs (weighted hanging leg raises and then side abs)
* Wed - Legs - machines: calves, hamgstings, hack squat, reverse lunges
* Thurs -rest
* Fri - shoulders (side and rear cables, seated shoulder press) & abs (same as tuesday)
* Weekend - rest

**Meals:**

* BF - 4 boiled eggs (salt and pepper), porridge (1 scoop - same scooper for protein) with 2 scoops of protein - with mushrooms reishi shitake turkey tail, plus maca, 1 coffee with <100ml oat milk and a few drops of coconut oil, plus chia seeds tea spoon, 1 banana and 1 apple
* Lunch - glass container 1040ml - filled with half rice half meat (2% turkey mince or 5% beef mince) (usual seasoning with 1 onion and one of spinach/peppers/kale)
* Dinner - same as lunch
* This week, I add 2 scoop protein shake with chia seeds with a banana.

  
I've just broken a plateau on pull ups and don't want to lose strength again.  
  
Any advice would be most appreciated, if anyone has experienced this and overcome it please let me know.

  
Best,

I don’t know about you, but I’m constantly blown away by just how *far* we’ve come in giving people the ability to automate almost anything—without ever writing a line of code. It used to be that building tools, workflows, or “smart” processes belonged to the exclusive realm of programmers. Little walled gardens, if you will. Now it’s like, “You’ve got an idea? There’s probably a drag and drop for that.”

**Why am I so jazzed?** Let’s break it down:

- You can connect your emails, your Slack, your Notion docs—your entire digital life, pretty much!
- You can do things that feel like superpowers: “When it rains, text my mom” or “Collect product reviews in a spreadsheet, summarize, and alert me if there’s a nasty one.”
- The time you save compounds. Ten minutes here, two hours next week… suddenly you’re sipping coffee while the “work” does itself.

There’s real joy in being able to say, “I automated that.” No code automation is like digital LEGO—it rewards curiosity, unlocks new efficiency, and gives anyone with a mouse and a little patience a chance to try their hand at ‘building something.’

But here’s what’s really exciting: **No code empowers creativity.** People with zero programming background are piecing together solutions for health, finance, home life, and more. Small businesses are tapping into automations that would have cost thousands a decade ago—now, it’s sometimes a free plan, a few clicks, and voilà.

**Here are a couple of my favorite use cases:**

- Automatically organize and categorize all incoming files for a team, so nobody’s hunting for documents.
- Collect social mentions about your project and wire them into a single Trello board—instant pulse of the community!
- Run custom (super-smart!) reports on your business totally hands-free.

Sure, there are challenges—sometimes friction or limitations—but the pace of evolving tools is bananas. Every month brings smarter triggers, friendlier UIs, new integrations.

**What about you?**  
- Which tasks in your life or work have you automated without code?  
- What do you *wish* you could automate?  
- What’s a personal victory from your no-code journey that you want to share?

Let’s celebrate these moments, big and small. No code automation isn’t just a fad—it feels like the future, now within reach of more hands than ever before. Can’t wait to hear what you all are building! 🚀",1,1756636133.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False

We started as hook up buddies but quickly grew fond of each other. I would stay over at his place during weekends, going on dates, fucking etc. On our second date he said he really liked me, but because he recently lost his job which was an important part of his life, he's not ready to date and just looking for a fwb and he hoped we can stay where we were. I took a few days to take it in and decided to end things with him as I figure I really liked him and I can't be happy with just being fwbs. However, I went a week without him and caved and texted him and we were back at it again, I just settled for less at that point and agreed with whatever he said, as long as we're together.

We kept on seeing each other, doing what we were doing, however, I fell in love more and more with him as time went by. As we are nothing serious, we can basically hook up or see other people. At one point, few months into being with him, I asked if we could become something more serious again and expressed that I'm not interested in hookups much and would rather be with him only. He declined again and I did not have it in me to walk away (which I should of). I did fuck around quite a lot myself but simultaneously I don't get to know anyone because mentally I am thinking about him. 

One day he came back from a trip and asked to see me in a coffee shop and he told me about this wonderful hook up he just had last night when he was away. I did not take it well and just started crying in the coffee shop. It felt terrible because I realized he would fuck someone else immediately when he has the chance. I was never enough and never the only choice, which he made clear actually, I just ignored and lied to myself the whole time.

We kept going for a bit (I know), until I had to move away for a job for a few months. The first month was tough and I missed him constantly while trying to fuck other guys just to forget him. Next 2 months felt bit better and I was starting to move on. However, I'm now back in my old place for a month to finish some stuff and we met up and I just fell all over again. I was in denial once again that we're good together.

However, last weekend he had a trip to London to visit some friends. I couldn't stop but thinking about how he would meet up and hook up with people there. I spent the whole weekend being anxious and sitting on the thought and it was not a nice feeling. To make matters worse I actually opened grindr and met some guy myself which I don't know why I did. Eventually asked him about it and he told me he fucked 3 guys that day, coincidentally I was also on my third hook up of the day. I felt terrible as a person because I love him, I'm upset and hurt that he's fucking someone else, but also I hate myself because I am no different, or at least never have the chance to be different. I was all over the place, even now as I'm writing this. 

I know full well that I should move on, get away from him. And I have to work on myself and I have many problems. My friends have told me countless of times that I deserve better. But at the same time, I am just too weak. My ultimate solution to everything is just moving away to a new place and it worked everytime. Just want to let it out and seek some help since I don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff.",1,1756635796.0,askgaybros,4,0.67,False
