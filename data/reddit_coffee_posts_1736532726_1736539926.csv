Hello everyone, I'm asking for help because I haven't been able to rest when I sleep for several months. My problem is that I can't sleep for 8 hours straight without getting up and waking up well rested. I don't have any problems falling asleep, I fall asleep pretty quickly.

Use of supplements Magnesium Citrate powder (400mg). I have been trying Tryptophan for a week (2 capsules of 360mg but I wake up with a slight headache, I went down to 1 capsule and the headache is milder but it still persists)

A year ago I was trying Potassium Citrate in capsules (220mg), it really helped me to be well up even though I hadn't slept 7/8 hours but today I don't feel the same effect. I have used 3mg of melatonin but it only makes me feel tired and unable to fall asleep, I don't feel like I'm resting.

I always try to meditate every day, although today I am alternating days, sometimes I feel tired and I don't feel like it. I also read a little before going to sleep. I use my PC/Phone up to 30-60 minutes before going to sleep. I don't take any caffeine, no coffee or mate.
 
I exercise, 3-5 times a week weightlifting, I do it until 7pm. I come home, take a shower, have dinner at 8-9pm and go to sleep at 10:30-11pm. I get up at 7:15-30, but I almost always wake up earlier like at 6am.

I really don't know what to do, does Magnesium Glycinate really make much difference compared to Magnesium Citrate for sleeping?

I sometimes get the worst headaches still (despite decreasing my caffeine so much for a year now) and have to drink coffee or tea. I get about 6-7 hours of sleep nightly but have thyroid issues paired with lupus so sometimes the fatigue hits hard too.

I could hear the beeping of my alarm and sat up slowly and groggily. Removing the blindfold I used to help me sleep, I was almost instantly blinded by the warm light of Venlil Prime’s omnipresent sun pouring in through the window. The thin curtain covering the window barely blocked out the sun. Blinking a few times and rubbing my eyes, I slowly sat up and looked around, trying to get used to the light. After a few more blinks, my vision finally cleared enough for me to actually see my room somewhat clearly.

Leaning over, I tapped the stop alarm button on my tablet, before sighing. I felt a low, dull, throbbing pain coursing through my legs as I simply sat in my bed still barely awake. Seems like the high gravity has already started to get to me. Hopefully after a few more days of this, or well whatever passes for a day here, I’ll be used to this, but I doubted that. 

Not wanting to get up just yet, I picked up my tablet and unlocked it. First on my agenda was briefly checking my messages to see if I missed anything while I slept. As I opened my messages, I saw one from Veni and sighed loudly. While she wasn’t anything like the exterminators that I had been warned about, she still could be a bit much for me. And besides, I still couldn’t place her motives with me. It almost seemed like she hit on me every chance she got, but surely she wasn’t, right? I mean she was oddly attractive, but like surely she wasn’t into me? Wasn’t she supposed to hate my species? Tapping my fingers on my cheek, opened my message and began to read.

TO: DR. THERESA CHAMBERS

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After much discussion with Magister Chevek and Renva, we decided that it would be best if I brought you directly to the housing project in the guild’s van. So, I’ll be coming to pick you up by the end of your first claw. 

Yours truly, 

Chief Exterminator Veni

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh right, that. I wasn’t looking forward to the very busy schedule I was given yesterday(?), last paw(?), or whatever it was supposed to be. I had not one but two events sprung on me at the last minute, and thus wouldn’t get to spend time helping the museum staff prepare the arrival of my staff when they needed it most. Instead, I got to spend today, or well this paw, touring a construction site and meeting with local business owners. Why they needed me to do this before the museum was ready was beyond me. It didn’t make sense, but it wasn’t like I really had a say in the matter. I was to simply go along with whatever they needed me to do at the moment. After all, I didn’t want to really make enemies of the local government here mere days after arriving. 

Checking my calendar, I saw that I had around 90 minutes before Veni would arrive. Plenty of time for me to freshen up, eat breakfast and be ready for whatever was in store for me today. Turning my tablet off, I slid out of bed and stood up, before taking a nice long stretch. As I stretched, I could both hear and feel my back pop a bit and felt a wave of relief wash through me. 

I felt a little better as I quickly grabbed my mask and put it on, before exiting the room. I took a brief look around, trying to see if I could spot Teva, but to my disappointment, she wasn’t visible in the living room or the kitchen. Still, I called out her name a few times, hoping she’d answer. Our conversation yesterday had left me deeply concerned, I wanted more answers about, well, all of it. It felt like there was something deeply wrong to how she described the system of museums on Venlil Prime and I wanted to know more. Oh well, seems like that too would have to wait until later.

Feeling confident that the house was empty, I took off my mask and walked into the kitchen, looking for something to eat and for something to wake me up. I knew that my go to of a nice cup of coffee first thing in the morning was sadly out of the question, but maybe one of those energy drinks she had would make a good substitution. After all, she seemed to have a near limitless supply of them, so they must do something for her. Opening the fridge, I took out some of those starberries I had the other day and a can of her energy drink. Placing the berries on the counter, I briefly examined the can, trying to figure out the nutritional facts. Of course, I was assuming that I’d even be able to find that on the can. Thankfully after a bit of looking I found what I was looking for. Unfortunately for me, it seemed that this drink barely had any caffeine in it at all. From what I could tell, this had roughly the same amount of caffeine in it as a can of coke. Still, some caffeine might be better than no caffeine, I reasoned. 

I opened the can and idly sipped on it as I made a small bowl of berries for myself. Placing the rest of them back in the fridge I ate the berries as I mentally prepared myself for what’s in store for myself. I could at least be myself around Veni, but Renva or the locals? I felt like I was walking on eggshells when I talked with them. Everyone I had met so far seemed terrified of me, and it was already starting to get old. I ruminated on this for a while, before finishing up my berries and cleaning up after myself. 

After finishing up with my breakfast, I took a quick shower and then began preparing myself for what was to come. Checking the time on my tablet, I could see that I still had around an hour before Veni was set to arrive, which was more than enough time for me to mentally prepare myself for my day. 

First, I took a look again at the pamphlet they had sent me about the housing project I was to tour. It had a few pictures of the clearly still under construction building, along with a long list of features. What caught my eye about this list of features was how inane and random it all seemed. A lot of the features were clearly holdovers from when it was supposed to be an apartment building for workers at the local factory, but others were simply bizarre. One of the selling points seemed to be that the building would have a common area we could use for “our predatory games”. From the photos included, this common area was just the lobby. It felt almost condescending with how this was being handled, and I would make that very clear. Even the mentioned features that weren’t condescending sounding seemed almost pointless to include. Like it made sure to mention that the building would have hot *and* cold water. Still, I couldn’t fully fault them. At least they were making an effort at ensuring that everyone who would be arriving soon would have a place to live. 

Next was trying to figure out what to expect from the meeting after my tour. Now that was something I was a little nervous about, especially if my previous experiences in town were anything to go by. It seemed that even the best intentioned people here were truly and almost impressively clueless about humans and earth. I began running over some hypothetical questions that I might be asked, things like if we needed to regularly consume flesh or how often we had the urge to kill small animals or something. Really, I was preparing myself for the worst of the worst questions that I knew I would encounter later. As I thought some more about this, my tablet beeped with a text. 

I picked it up and saw a message from Veni waiting to be read. Taking a look at it I saw that it was simply her letting me know that she was almost here. Seemed like time had gotten away from me as I thought about my day. Getting up from where I set myself down on the couch, I quickly made my way to my room and grabbed my satchel. I took out my field notebooks and tossed them onto my bed, before stashing my tablet inside my bag, throwing my mask on and running out the door. 

As I left Teva’s house, I could see a silver van easing around the curve leading to her house. The driver’s side window was down and I could see Veni’s dark grey wooled arm hanging out of it. Come to think of it, why could I see her wool? Didn’t she have a uniform she was supposed to be wearing? Maybe they only wore them in emergencies. As I pondered this, I watched the van come to a leisurely stop in front of the house and saw Veni looking down at me from the window. 

“It’s just me escorting you today, so why don’t you hop in the passenger side and we’ll be off! I’m so excited to have some time *alone* with you to get to know you a bit better\~” She said in her usual almost flirty tone as she opened the door and hopped out of the van. She walked up to me and seemingly purred

“Here, I’ll get the door for you\~” 

“It’s… uh nice to see you too Veni. You certainly seem enthusiastic about today…” I replied as I took note of her uniform choice for today, or well, lack thereof. Rather than the ubiquitous silvery suit of most exterminators, she had opted for a simple belt/sash combo. It was made of a similar silvery material, but left nothing to the imagination. Worse still, her wool was trimmed short and close to her body and under said wool I could see just how fit she seemed. Her arms, while not overly large, were still clearly quite muscular. As she passed in front of me to guide me to the passenger side door, I was given a full view of her rear. While her arms weren’t that well built, her lower body certainly was. Her thighs especially seemed to be particularly well built, with myself finding that I had to resist the urge to stare at them. 

As she reached the passenger side door, she turned around to face me and I had never been happier to be wearing that mask. I could feel a blush burning on my face as I looked over hers. The wool on her head was longer than the rest of her wool and was swept to the side. And then there were her eyes. They were this brilliant shade of teal, one that reminded me of the color of tropical waters. As I looked her over, I could see that she seemed to be doing the same. There was something I couldn’t place behind her eyes, something that I would consider almost hungry… 

“There we go!\~ Why don’t you hop in and we’ll be off!\~” She said in that same flirty voice as she held the door open for me. I climbed into the van, and could’ve sworn I *felt* her gaze examining me as I did so. I took a seat and thanked her, before she closed the door behind me. 

She climbed into the driver’s seat and gave me another look that I could only describe as hungry, before telling me “I got here a little early, so I think I’ll take the scenic route\~ Show you a bit of the town since I don’t think you’ve gotten a chance to look around much\~ How does that sound?\~” 

I was still a little distracted from the look she gave me, so it took me a second to process what she said. I could still feel myself blushing as I tried to stammer out a response. From the flirting, to her body to that stare, I felt extremely flustered and oddly vulnerable. I was stuck inside this somewhat cramped front compartment with someone who seemed really into me and it was *doing things* to me. 

Once I had composed myself enough to speak, I gave her a fairly meek sounding reply of “A-a tour? T-that sounds lovely. J-just are you sure t-that we’ve got enough time to take one? W-what if we hit traffic?” She seemed to sense how flustered I was and gave me a knowing look before reassuring me with “Relax, there’s rarely any traffic here and besides we have plenty of time to enjoy the view before we get to the tour\~ And feel free to ask me *anything* you want to know and I’ll gladly answer it\~” 

As I tried to collect myself, I realized that she had started the engine and was already pulling away from the road Teva’s house was on. The van was clearly electric as it hardly made a sound as she drove along. Looking for an opportunity to be distracted from how forward she was being with me, I directed my attention out of the window and to passing streets. What caught my eye is that there didn’t seem to be a single corner anywhere. Every intersection was a traffic circle, and every road seemed to meander and bend like a river. It was actually a little disconcerting how there weren’t any straight lines anywhere. 

Looking over to Veni, I decided to ask her. “Hey, is there any reason why I haven’t seen a single corner anywhere?” 

“Hmmm? Oh! I didn’t realize that was something unusual! It’s a safety measure you see. When we’ve got a stampede happening, it’s simply safer to not have anywhere where the stampede can be cornered. With the roads like this, we can control the direction of the stampede and minimize casualties. Thankfully, Grovelake is small enough that any stampede I’ve seen here hasn’t been that bad” 

I looked at her with a look of shock as she casually mentioned that people stampede. I had heard rumors about things like that happening here, but dismissed them as hyperbole and conjecture. But to hear it described so matter of factly, that worried me. Worse to me was that they seemed to have designed their roads around this, rather than addressing the causes of it. 

“I… I uh see… How often do these… uh… stampedes occur?” I asked her, still unsure of how to feel about this whole thing. 

“That depends, often they start over basically nothing if I’m going to be honest. Someone gets spooked by something and then starts running and before you know it you’ve got the whole herd running away from nothing in a blind panic. Of course, this doesn’t lessen the danger or paperwork of the whole thing… But yeah, I’d say they’re pretty common. Thankfully with how small this town is and how sprawling it is, my guild has to deal with them far less than others. And when they do happen here, they’re very easy to contain.” 

She sighed, and I got the hint that despite how matter of fact she made it sound, there was something else at play. Something that I probably shouldn’t pry at. She looked out the windshield and was silent for a moment as the both of us just took in the scenery. The road we were on cut through a forest of uncomfortably uniform looking trees. Unlike a natural forest, these were arranged in neat grid rows and seemed to be manicured regularly. What caught my eye however was what we were approaching.

Ahead of us was another traffic circle, just one far larger than any we had gone through so far. Even more interesting was what lay in the center of it. A colossal, grass covered mound sat in the middle of it. It was easily over a dozen meters tall and had an extremely wide base. What struck me most about this however was the truly ancient looking tree sitting at its summit. It was the same type of tree as the others that I’ve seen in Grovelake, only far, far older. Its trunk was easily 3-4 times the diameter of the ones in the surrounding forest, and its root network dug into the surface of the mound in a tangle of thick, gnarled roots. Most awe inspiring however was its canopy. A green sea of leaves spread out high above the mound, almost completely covering it in a green tinted shade. 

As we neared the mound, Veni excitedly gestured to it, before telling me “Up ahead, we have one of my favorite parts of Grovelake, the Grovelake Mound! It’s this really big hill with one of the biggest trees I’ve ever seen on top. A fantastic spot to relax and just take in the beauty of the area. *Especially when spending with someone like you\~ Plus, it’s nice and private\~*” 

I blushed again as her flirting resumed, but was still captivated by the mound. As we entered the traffic circle, it became clear that the mound was nearly perfectly circular in shape, and it hit me. I had seen something like this before. Actually, I’ve seen many things like this before. Dr. Sharpe was a leading expert on the pre-columbian cultures of the midwest, with a special focus on the aptly named Mound Builder culture. His whole office was full of images of burial mounds that looked eerily similar to the one before me. And yet, Veni had called it a hill. 

Considering what I had heard about the sad state of Venlil 'anthropology', I wouldn’t be surprised if no one had ever excavated it. I didn’t voice my suspicions to her, but did take a mental note to show the mound to Dr. Sharpe when he arrived. After all, it looked too artificial to be a simple natural hill. Even the tree seemed to have been planted with intention. Then again, I was no archaeologist, so I couldn’t be certain. Turning to Veni, I softly replied

“I can see why you’d want to take someone up there. I bet the view from up there is amazing…” 

I watched her think for a moment, before she gave me that same almost hungry, or dare I say, predatory glance. She leaned over the center console and practically whispered 

“Of course, I feel like we’d be distracted by another view\~ I know you already have\~ Not that I mind\~ In fact, I might’ve been doing the same\~” 

She then pulled away and went back to keeping her eyes on the road like nothing had happened at all. I however was beyond flustered. I sat there, practically frozen in my seat as I realized that she had known that I was checking her out earlier the whole time. I looked out the window as I tried to compose myself once more. As I watched uniform row after row of trees pass by, I slowly felt the heat on my face subside. Once I felt collected enough, I looked back to her and saw that a faint orange glow had become visible under her wool, yet she seemed just as calm and collected as always. 

We drove along the forest road for a bit more, before it gave way to the town once more. As I watched rows of trees turn into rows of buildings, it struck me with how spread out the town felt. Most of the structures we passed were similar to Teva’s house. Short, squat, single story buildings with an almost hexagonal shape to them. It fittingly felt very alien, yet at the same time reminded me of many of the towns I’d passed through on my own drives between New York and Chicago. Sure, the buildings were different, but it still had that smaller town feel to it all. It even had that same kind of decay I had seen in many of the towns that never fully recovered from the satellite wars. Boarded up buildings were sadly not an uncommon sight, and just like in many of those towns back on earth, clear ghosts of better times remained. 

As we drove deeper into what seemed to be the heart of town, these ghosts only grew in frequency. Run down looking and shuttered storefronts that clearly used to be higher end stores dotted a few of the streets, and even the open stores looked a little sad. They had scarcely any customers inside and the few that were there seemed miserable. 

Slowly, this decay gave way to some more life as we neared what I assumed was the heart of town. Ahead, I could see what I assumed was the housing complex looming over the rest of the town. Three hexagonal blocks of white concrete rose roughly 9 stories up over the rest of town. Unlike most of the structures we had passed however, these had a new facade to them. From just a glance, I could tell that they would be more than sufficient for even 3 times the number of people arriving. 

We entered another large traffic circle and two structures immediately caught my eye. On one end of the traffic circle sat an ornately decorated and designed building. While it kept the overall feel and shape as the other buildings around it, it had a wide set of stairs leading up to an all glass front wall. Opposite to it was a far more modest and unassuming structure. It sat 3 stories tall and sprawled out. However, just from looking at it, it was starting to enter a state of disrepair. Its facade, a colorful mix of pastel colored, square panels, was starting to crack and fracture. There was a sign out front, but it had enough letters missing to make it impossible for my translator to parse what it was supposed to be. 

Confused, I turned to Veni and asked her “Those two buildings in front of us seem fairly important. What are they?” 

“The one to our left is the magistrate's office. All the magister’s for the Grovelake district have an office there. It’s also really new. I think it was only a few cycles ago that it was decided that we should renovate it into a truly modern building. Before then, I’m pretty sure it was pushing eight decades and it was really starting to show.”

She paused for a second, before seemingly lighting up a bit as she turned her attention to the building to the right of us. “Over there is where I work. That’s the Grovelake Exterminator’s Guild. My office is actually up there in the middle of the third floor. See that window? That’s it. I’ve got a lovely view of this little circle. Although not nearly as lovely a view as I’m getting right now\~ Maybe I can give you a personal tour of it some day\~” 

That last part sounded a little ominous, and I think she realized that too as she quickly added “On second thought, I think that might be a bad idea. Now a personal tour of *your* office?\~ That would probably work much better\~” 

“Now, after I leave this circle, it’ll only be a few more \[minutes\] before we reach the housing complex so I want to get a few things straight before then. Renva can be a little skittish, so I’ll help you out of the van and keep close to you. Hopefully with me sticking near you, she’ll feel safe” 

I looked over to her just in time to see her give me one of the smuggest looks I’ve ever seen. Oh yeah, for Renva’s ‘protection’. She doesn’t have any ulterior motives with that plan, not at all. And I bet when she wraps one of those strong arms around me that’ll be part of the plan too. Realizing the direction my thoughts are going, I quickly move to change the subject.

“I-Is there anything else I should be aware of before meeting her?” I asked, hoping that I don’t sound too flustered. She gave me another smug look as she placed a paw on my shoulder. I shivered a bit from her touch as she gently says

“Just relax and follow my lead, Theresa\~ I’ll make sure nothing goes awry, ok?\~” 

There was a hint of genuine concern for me in her voice, and I could tell that she wanted to make sure that I was doing ok before we left the van. Her paw lingered on my shoulder for a bit, before she removed it as we pulled in front of the building.

1hydhb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1hydhb0/my_boss_is_trying_to_take_my_tips_im_a_barista_at/,My boss is trying to take my tips! I’m a barista at a small local business.,"
So this coffee shop I’ve worked at for 4 months has had a lot of sketchy things happen which have made me consider quitting. 
THIS situation might do it 😬
So for info, there is no clock in/clock out here. You’re scheduled for your shift and that’s what you get paid for. Doesn’t matter if you come in earlier and hop in or stay later to help your coworkers. You just get paid what you’re scheduled. 
So today my shift was 7-9:30am. The owner came in for her shift early and started working on stuff that I had out as more customers came in. Around 9:29/30 I was helping this group that came in, they took a while to order but I helped them, and then made all of their drinks. It was a good size order and they tipped $9. It is time stamped for 9:34. After that, I cashed out and took my card tips for the day which totaled $15. FIFTEEN DOLLARS. That $9 was more than half of what I would have got today.So imagine my surprise when she texts me asking for the $9 returned so she can have it for her shift??? She’s the owner and works most of the day (mid)! The opener (me) and closer only have 2.5 hour shifts. She gets a majority of the tips anyway because she works the busiest hours. Also I should say there hasn’t been a “last time” like she’s implying. She’s confusing me with someone else I’m pretty sure? This hasn’t happened to me before, and if it did, I’d be fighting to figure out what to do like I am now! This policy that she explains in the last text hasn’t been told to me before. I’ve definitely taken tips after my “shift end” if it was a customer who I helped on the register and made the drink myself. I live in WA state and I thought owners weren’t so supposed to take any tips. I don’t care but she’s trying to take mine so how should I proceed?? I don’t feel like giving it back and I’m considering quitting over this.  

I can’t attach pics of our text but this is how it goes:

Boss:
Hey so I was checking the tips from this morning and it looks like you claimed the tip after 9:30 again. 
*Includes photo of transactions that shows the 9:34 timestamp for tip in question*

Me:
I only included that one because it was that group who I helped and made all the drinks for

Boss:
Like I explained last time. The tips switch over at the next shift. I was making and cleaning up the breakfast sandwiches you had out and unfinished which I started over 10 minutes prior to my shift. I was working during my shift finishing that as well. It doesn't matter what it is you're specifically doing, tips goes to the next on shift at shift change because your shift is over.


I haven’t replied after that because I don’t know what to think but this just doesn’t seem right? I live in Washington State and Google says owners aren’t typically supposed to get tips but I don’t know much. What are my rights here when my scheduled shift ended at 9:30 but I stayed and the last group that tipped me is time stamped for 9:34? Again, there’s no clock in/ clock out that proves I stayed later or has my name attached to that transaction.

Any advice on how to respond and proceed would be greatly appreciated. I’m a 26f and new to Reddit. I was recommended to post here after posting on another social media platform 

EDIT: I’ve been taken off the schedule 🙃 is this technically her firing me? I never responded to her message and she didn’t say anything about firing me",1,1736539400.0,barista,2,1.0,False

# Duftzwillinge Q&A:

**Warum entscheiden sich manche Leute für Duftalternativen anstelle der Originalparfüms?**

Manche Menschen wählen Duftalternativen aufgrund ihres erschwinglichen Preises. Andere schätzen die Möglichkeit, ähnliche Düfte zu einem Bruchteil des Preises zu erhalten, besonders wenn sie verschiedene Optionen ausprobieren möchten, ohne viel Geld auszugeben.

**Was sind Parfüm Dupes?**

Parfüm Dupes sind Parfüms, die ähnliche oder identische Duftnoten wie bekannte Markenprodukte enthalten, jedoch zu einem niedrigeren Preis angeboten werden.

**Warum werden Parfüm Dupes hergestellt?**

I have a few concerns surrounding the potential of pursuing what may potentially be coming to fruition.

● - As am in the UK, I am unsure of the legislation Royal Mail may have around pursuing a relationship with someone you deliver to, but as far as I know, there is nothing black and white saying you cannot pursue a relationship.

● - I worry that if my feelings aren't reciprocated or things don't work out, it could have the potential to become quite awkward.

● - I'd also worry that it is quite invasive of me to be fancying someone as they try to get their work done.

I am conscious of the age gap, but it does not bother me too much, but I cannot speak on his behalf.


TL;DR: I fancy my postman, and I think he likes me back based on his behaviour, but I worry about it becoming awkward if this is not the case and do not wish to perv on someone just trying to do their job. Thank you! :)",1,1736539347.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

i am studying in one of those cities from August 18th-September 27th. i will then be heading to Sydney, Australia for 12 weeks to finish out my semester in December.

my main priority in any of those cities include 

-safety and the ability to have perfect running conditions (trails, parks, forests, somewhere safe, bonus points for actual races.) 

-i also want to experience the culture, meet as many locals and international ppl as possible. i envision museums, art galleries, restaurants, and coffee shops

-have good, fresh coffee. on the top of drinks, i don’t drink so idc abt the drinking culture as much

-i love and prioritize fresh fruits and seafood

-accessibility travel to other countries on the weekends. (really want to prioritize visiting Greece & Croatia.)

-idc about weather cuz it’ll be legit hotter than hell at home when i leave to study abroad lol 

i meet with my advisor next week so i would love to hear anyone’s opinions, stories, or experiences in any of those cities.

thank u all in advance ☺️

1hyd8zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hyd8zv/aita_for_not_refusing_to_be_my_best_friends_moh/,AITA for not refusing to be my best friend's MOH?,"I (23F) have this friend, Jessica (25F). Jessica and I met in college when I was a freshman/Junior and she was a senior. We worked together and became really close. After she graduated we stayed in touch and would still hang out on my holidays. Jessica got engaged to her high school sweetheart, Jason (22M). I was on holiday from school and was spending a week with her and she asked me to be her MOH. I said yes. I was super excited for her and we immediately jumped into her bouncing ideas off of me and us doing the whole Pinterest mood board and Instagram deep dives for inspiration.

After the week, I went back to school (a four hour drive one way) and made it clear to Jessica that I wouldn't be able to do a lot of the day to day ins and outs (she opted not to have a wedding planner/coordinator) with her because of the distance and that if she wanted to make her future SIL her maid of honor instead I would understand and still be there for her regardless. She said that it wasn't a problem and that anyway I could contribute would be enough. She confirmed that she still wanted me to be her MOH and we got back to planning. 

Fast forward to the end of semester of college (3 months after engagement). Jessica has by now picked the color scheme and overall decor theme (her color scheme was red and emerald accents which rustic brown main, and tied together with silver and the theme was ""rustic barn wood chic""), and is looking to start looking at venues. I went down to visit her again after finals and before moving into my new place. For context, my boyfriend, David (29M), and I had recently bought our first house together after dating for a 3 1/2 years. It was the same cost wise as renting and at the end of the day, we would own the house we were paying for. 

During my vacation with Jessica, we were looking at different venues to narrow down the options she wanted before she brought Jason to look. We also went and looked at a couple of houses for sale in the area, as Jessica and Jason were renting and were having issues with their landlord and wanted to get out of the situation. Throughout these house tours Jessica kept making comments about how I should ditch David and buy a house closer to her. I laughed it off and enjoyed the rest of my vacation before returning home to help David move in (6h one way from Jessica)

Fast forward again (six months to wedding) and the date for the wedding has been set. Jessica was really jumping back and forth between three dresses and couldn't decide on which style she liked and which shade of red she wanted so I took it upon myself to order the three dresses in my size, each dress a different shade of red and had them in time for our next pow wow, the only one Jessica drove the six hours to see me for. (Not that we're keeping track but by this time I've driven back and forth about 6 times in six month, which I was completely fine with as everything for the wedding was in Jessica's area.) I paid for the dresses out of my own pocket as it was an item that I was going to keep and because Jessica's budget was so tight, myself and the two other bridesmaids (both SIL's), were paying for anything we were keeping. 

Jessica picked the dress and we sent the links for it to the other two bridesmaids and I set up to return the dresses for a partial refund and to order the chosen dress in the chosen color. The dress cost $300 dollars stock and would need additional alterations to fit. 

Jessica also decided on shoes during this visit. She saw my pair of cowboy boots by my front door and decided that they would look ""so perfect"" with the dress. She found them online and sent them to the girls. They were $350 dollar boots. Kiara, one of the bridesmaids kicked up a fuss, saying it was more expensive than the dress and not something that she would ever wear again and that with the style of the dress you wouldn't even be able to see the boots. Jessica immediately started stressing about how this was going to ruin her wedding day. To keep the peace, I offered to pay for the price of the boots and if Kiara really didn't want them I would take them after because we have the same size feet. She would just have to suck it up and wear them for the ceremony and pictures. Everyone calmed back down and everything was fine. I said I wasn’t worried about it as I could just wear the pair I already owned. Jessica argued that she wanted all of us to be in new boots as it would ""look better for the photos"" and ""would be something cute for wedding bonding"" Still wanting to maintain the peace and wanting to move on from the shoe debacle, I agreed.

Not long after, we all get together and go dress shopping. The party consisted of the bride, Mother, MIL, both SIL and me. We all had a great time watching Jessica get to be a princess and she ended up getting her entire outfit for the day of the wedding. Afterward we all agreed we would go out together for a late lunch at a local sub shop. Jessica made a joke about how her meal should be on me because I wasn't able to make it to her DIY wedding decor wine nights because I ""chose to shack up so far away"". I was a little hurt because I had warned her that I wasn't going to be able to do the spur of the moment get together not to mention I had done my part of all of that and had gone out and bought the supplies and made the centerpieces and had plugged in via facetime. I didn't want to argue or cause drama and so I agreed to pay for her sandwich. 

When we got to the restaurant Jessica couldn't decide what she wanted and decided she didn't want a sub. Since it was ""her day"" she wanted hibachi grill. We all argued that hibachi at 2:30 in the afternoon was a lot and not what we had agreed to or budgeted for. Jessica started to scream at the top of her lungs about how we were all bullying her and we never did anything for her and she was always having to give in to what we wanted to do and that she wanted to do what she wanted to do for once. The entirety of the VERY crowded sub shop got to witness this tantrum and in order to keep her from making even more of a scene, we all quickly agreed and half shoved her out the door. 

We went to the grill and ate our meal without issue. When our server returned to the table and asked how we would like the check split, Jessica pointed at me and said that I would be covering the bill. I disagreed and so did the rest of the table. Jessica got upset and said that it was my responsibility as her MoH to pay for things like this and how I clearly wasn't hurting for money because I had a house and I could afford to treat the group. I told her that since I had agreed to pay for her meal, I would honor that, not that I was buying for everyone. She tried to keep arguing but MIL quietly but firmly told the server to split all but mine and Jessica's meals onto separate checks. Jessica said that we were all being unfair and ganging up on her and that if that was how we all wanted to be then she didn't want to deal with us anymore. She got up and left. We all looked at each other, put it down to wedding stress, paid for our meals ($150, 60 of which was my meal) and left.

Now it's less than a month to the day of the wedding and I get a message in the group text from Jessica that says that she's been thinking about it and that she wants to change the style of the dress for the wedding from a floor length skirt with a mid-slit in merlot to a high low skirt in Redcurrant. As you could probably guess, this causes mayhem. The dresses have already been altered, meaning that they were no longer refundable. Through a very long and drawn out argument that I won't include here, I talk Jessica out of the redcurrant color change and get her to agree to keep the shade of red so that further adjustment only had to be made to the dresses we already had. I personally called around and was able to find a shop that was willing to take on the major alteration last minute and booked the appointment, offering to pay for the further alteration expenses that were not in anyone's original budget so that they could be done and the bride didn't blow a fuse.

Now we're in the week before the wedding. My fiancé proposed to me and I was over the moon. I immediately reached out to family and friends with the news and everyone was super excited for me. Everyone except for Jessica. Her immediate reaction was to call me on the phone demand that I not say anything to anyone about it until after her wedding and that I even go so far as to not wear my ring as it would draw attention away from her big day. I told her it was too late for not telling as my friend group and family already knew as it was on my social media and that I doubted that it would have any effect on her big day. I didn't know anyone at the wedding besides the wedding party. She screamed at me about how inconsiderate I was for not asking her first and hung up on me. 

Two days later (4 days before the wedding) I drove down for her bachelorette day. We went to the spa for massages, mani/pedis, and all around pampering. I covered the bill for the bride and everyone's basic packages and the party paid for any add ons they decided they wanted day of. Jessica did not speak to me or even look at me for the entire day, except to glare at the ring on my finger, but we still had fun.  


The day before the wedding, I drive down super early to help set up for the following day and check in to my Airbnb for the weekend. I had rented the house for around 300 per night because, 

1) I wasn't going to drive down morning of and drive back after.

2) it offered more room and a better set up for the girls to get ready the next day,

3) It gave the bride a place to stay the night before since she didn't want Jason to see her before the wedding and she didn't want to pay for a hotel

 4) My birthday had passed 2 days before and David suggested that we stay a couple extra days and make a little mini vacation out of it. Because of these few extra days, I offered to cover the entire cost of the Airbnb, without telling Jessica about the extra couple of days stay since it didn't have anything to do with her and she would be on her way to her honeymoon destination anyway.

So we get everything set up for the ceremony by 4pm and start the rehearsals 5:30p I get a phone call from my fiancé telling me that there's an issue with his vehicle and he's not going to be able to meet me at the wedding. I reiterated this to Jessica as she wanted to know what phone call was so important to interrupt her rehearsal. She began to panic that without David there would be an uneven number of guests at her head table and that he needed to get his ass to her wedding, even if it meant getting an Uber. 

So we finished up rehearsals and at 6pm I started the drive back home to pick up David. It was just after midnight when I got home and then I switched and let David drive back to where the wedding was being held. Because of having to stop for fuel and David stopped at around halfway for coffee and fast food, letting me sleep through both of these stops, we got to the Airbnb at 6:45, giving a little over an hour to drag myself out of the car and into the shower before people started showing up. Jessica was not there.

Turns out she had railed about how inconsiderate I was to leave her wedding rehearsal, even though it had ended. What if there had been an emergency, what if she needed me? And on and on. She ended up going back to her place and getting in an argument with Jason, who went to spend the night at his mom's. 

We go through getting ready without too many problems. I was still exhausted but it was nothing that a very large coffee and a little extra concealer couldn't fix. Jessica was irritable and liable to snap at anyone if they stood still or looked at her too long. We all chalked it up to pre-wedding jitters and moved on.

The wedding was perfect, everything went off without a hitch. We did the first round of posed photos, into the ceremony which was lovely, then guests were ushered into the cocktail hour (just drinks, no food). The second round of photos were just of the bride and groom, I had made the suggestion that we all move off to help wrangle cocktail hour and give the bride and groom a quiet moment together to just take in the fact that they were married. Jessica loved the idea and implemented it. I made sure that everything was good with the guests and then pulled the MIL aside to let her know that I was going to run and find something to eat.

At this point, I had not eaten anything since a very light lunch at noon the day before. I had made sure that the bride and girls had eaten and in the rush to keep everything moving smoothly, I had neglected to eat anything myself and was now nauseous and lightheaded. MIL understood and David took me to the closest thing to us that might have food, the Municipal bar. I got a small order of fries and a water. David had a mixed drink, we were gone for a total of 23 minutes. When we got back, everyone was still enjoying cocktails while the bride and groom had just finished photos. Jessica asked me where I had gone and I told her the muni. She nodded but didn't say anything. The rest of the night was great.

The next day everything went off without a hitch. We cleaned up the venue and the bride and groom made their flight. David and I had our little mini vacation and did the whole couple thing.  We posted a couple of photos on socials and turned in.

The next morning, I woke up to a bombardment of texts from Jessica accusing me of blowing off her wedding and using my place as MoH as an excuse to have a vacation. She said that I was an a\*\*h\*\*\* for not just declining being her MOH if I wasn't willing to put in the effort to make her my top priority for the sake of her wedding and she couldn't believe I was such a fake friend to her. I tried to respond but she has me blocked and has plaster all kinds of awful things on social media calling me a variety of absolutely horrible things about how I refused to pay for my share of everything and refused to let her have the wedding of her dreams. I can kind of see what she means considering the distance made it more difficult for me to be involved but the way I see it, I warned her that my involvement would be difficult due to the long distance and she had ample opportunity to change her mind about me being the MOH.  AITA?

1hyd7mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1hyd7mh/secret_conflict_operação_pato_manso/,[SECRET] [CONFLICT] Operação Pato Manso,"## Operação Pato Manso

Under the cover of darkness on 29th April 1972, Portuguese helicopters discreetly inserted Flechas commandos and Grupos Especiais Pára-Quedistas (GEP) troops into the remote bush of Cuando Cubango province. The elite forces, many of them former guerrillas intimately familiar with UNITA's tactics and the unforgiving terrain, moved swiftly and silently to take up concealed positions around the site where UNITA's leadership was expected to gather for a major summit on 1st May.

For two days, the Flechas and GEP operatives lay in wait, barely moving from their hides, relying on the tracking expertise of Bushmen scouts to monitor the area. Any UNITA sentries who stumbled upon their positions were quickly and quietly killed, their bodies dragged into the undergrowth. The Portuguese set up hidden mortar positions and snipers in the trees, while GEP assault teams disguised themselves in captured UNITA uniforms and infiltrated to within metres of the meeting site.

At dawn on 1st May, the UNITA cadres began arriving in small groups, exchanging greetings and revolutionary slogans as they gathered for what they believed would be a momentous conference charting their future strategy. Sentries waved through familiar faces, unaware that some were GEP operatives who had perfected their accents and appearance. Among those in attendance was a senior UNITA negotiator who had been in secret contact with the Caetano government about a possible accommodation. He would never leave the camp alive.

As the sun rose higher and the UNITA members clustered under tarps for coffee and discussion, the Portuguese sprang their trap. Mortars rained down on pre-sighted targets as snipers picked off key figures. GEP infiltrators threw off their disguises and unleashed short-range firepower, gunning down disoriented fighters still fumbling for their weapons. Flechas teams emerged from the bush in a coordinated assault, raking the camp with small arms fire as the screams of the wounded mixed with the roar of automatic rifles.

Within 15 minutes of the first shots, the command post was overrun in a storm of grenades and close-quarters combat. Although the assault killed dozens of lower-ranking UNITA fighters and the key negotiator, no major leaders were captured or confirmed dead. Instead, the strike obliterated any goodwill that might have existed for future dialogue.

As some UNITA elements on the perimeter attempted to flee or regroup, they were cut down mercilessly by Alouette helicopter gunships and AT-6 light attack aircraft. The sky shook with the thunder of rockets and heavy machine guns as the escapees were ripped apart in the open scrubland, body parts strewn across the savanna. Portuguese tactical commanders forbade their soldiers from wasting medical supplies on enemy wounded.

Within five hours, Operation Pato Manso was complete. The attack, while tactically successful, failed in its strategic objectives. The UNITA leadership remained intact, and the loss of a political negotiator ensured that any potential for dialogue was destroyed. With no Portuguese casualties, the operation was hailed as a military success by hardliners, but it had come at the cost of escalating animosity and prolonging the conflict. As the smoke cleared, Flechas patrol groups policed the corpses, extracting gold fillings and scalping some for souvenirs. Prisoners were kicked and beaten as they were thrown into transport helicopters. The remains of the camp were torched and antipersonnel mines sown to deter recovery of the bodies.

[Governor-General da Luz Cunha](https://www.defesa.gov.pt/pt/defesa/historia/gcem/gcemgfa/PublishingImages/8.General%20Joaquim%20da%20Luz%20Cunha.jpg) savoured the bloody success of his operation, even as he knew it would enrage the moderate faction in Lisbon. For the hardliners, UNITA's negotiation track was dead along with its advocates, and no quarter would be asked or given in the accelerating race war for control of Angola. Pato Manso had sent an unmistakable message about who controlled the future of the colonies, and how that control would be exercised.

- - - 

### Context

Prime Minister Caetano's government made confidential overtures to UNITA in early 1972 as part of its broader strategy to introduce progressive autonomy in Angola. An effort was made to engage UNITA in a discreet dialogue to shape the autonomy plan, recognising UNITA's influence among the Ovimbundu people in central and southern Angola.

However, hardline elements within the Portuguese military and security apparatus vehemently opposed any accommodation with the nationalist insurgents. Governor-General da Luz Cunha, distrustful of Caetano's reform agenda, took matters into his own hands by launching Operation Pato Manso, a brutal decapitation strike intended to target UNITA's leadership as they gathered to consider the government's outreach.

The raid, conducted by elite Flechas commandos and GEP paratroopers, aimed to wipe out UNITA's high command before any negotiations could gain traction. The assault achieved its bloody objectives, killing a key UNITA negotiator and seizing valuable intelligence. However, it also definitively slammed the door on Caetano's hopes of co-opting Savimbi's movement and irreparably poisoned relations.

Pato Manso exposed the rifts within the Lisbon regime between reformers like Caetano and die-hard defenders of empire like da Luz Cunha. It demonstrated that security hardliners, with the backing of powerful elements in the colonial military and intelligence apparatus, had the capability and ruthlessness to sabotage any attempted compromises with nationalism.

The fallout from Pato Manso accelerated the unravelling of Portugal's Angola strategy by closing off potential political solutions and making continued conflict inevitable. It radicalised surviving UNITA elements and vindicated advocates of armed struggle over negotiation. Caetano's reformist faction, politically weakened by the blowback, found itself increasingly isolated and impotent.",3,1736538745.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

*THURSDAY*

Today is the day our truck delivers. We only get an order in once a week, so it's usually a lot. Takes a full crew to get it unloaded and processed, so all of us weekday stockers are required to be here. No exceptions. It gets a little chaotic, but I don't mind it too much. Makes the time go by faster. 

By the time I get here, they're usually more than halfway through it all. But today, truck got here late... so looks like I'll be busy until close. Fine with me, I drank an extra cup of coffee this morning, so I'm ready. It's strange, I'm actually in a pretty good mood today; almost excited to go to work. 

I clock in and join the rest of the crew in the warehouse. The openers are hard at work unloading and sorting all the merchandise. Jaden and Janie are the ones in charge of them all. We call them The Bitch Twins. Any other day, they could give a shit less about what's going on around here. But on truck day, they'll bite your head off if you don't move fast enough.

Luckily, the products start off normal when they  come in. They only start acting weird once they've been here a couple hours, so we try to get everything on the shelf as fast as we can. We start with the dairy and frozen items, since they need to be stocked first. I'd already noticed Yogurt Lady waiting by the coolers for a fresh batch, so I loaded Emma's cart up with everything that gets stocked in that area. Good luck to both of them. 

I step over Headless Elroy wiggling around on the floor, and grab my cart. This happens to him every Thursday; old man just cant keep up the pace, and The Bitch Twins show no mercy. His head usually re-spawns by the end of the night though, so it's no big deal. 

""Move it, Elroy."" I say, kicking his shoulder as I pass. He just starts flailing around even more, so I scoot him over to the side with my foot. 

I took the milk, Chris took the eggs, and Paul got stuck with all the freezer items. He was pissed, of course, but I don't give a shit. The only reason the freezer is so hard to stock is because he'd been using it as a body storage, until it got too full. He made that mess, he can fucking deal with it.

Once I finish putting away everything on my cart, I look over to Chris to see if he needs any help with his. He does. He's covered in egg juice, fighting with his extra hand trying to get the carton away from it. I walk up to him, and ask,

""Need a hand?""

He doesn't laugh, he just glares at me in defeat. I turn around, bend over, and the hand drops the carton. 

""Hey, thanks man!!"" Chris says.

Usually I'd clean up this mess myself, but I'm just too busy today. I walk past Emma snacking on a yogurt covered finger, and go over to the wall phone to page Lenny for a clean up. When I put the receiver to my ear, it licks me. Disgusting, I know. But, a phone tongue is better than the last thing it shoved into my ear. 

Lenny takes over 10 minutes to show up with the mop and bucket. By then, the floor is covered with raw egg/yogurt soup, and the Turd Slug is lapping it up. I tell Lenny just to stand there and wait till it's finished. We don't need any bigger of a mess. Speaking of, I should probably go check on Paul in the freezers. *Eh,* maybe later. 

One of the openers must have been shoved outside before 8:00, because I noticed there's one less here than usual. Every so often, the openers get together and choose one unfortunate soul amongst them to sacrifice to The Earlybirds. The openers say it keeps them from ever actually coming inside, but I think they're all just sadistic. Or bored. Thank God they're all about to leave. 

Duffle Bag Man just shuffled in. You'd think he brings that bag in here to shoplift, but it's the opposite. The bag is full when he comes in here, and empty when he leaves. I have no clue what the fucker is bringing here, but whatever it is, it *can't* be good. I'm sure I'll find out... eventually. 

The Hum seems like it's getting quieter, because I can barely hear it tonight. We only have a few carts left to put out, so I leave them to it and head toward the break room with my brown paper bag. I get in there, and Lenny's dripping all over the sandwich he's eating. When he sees me, he stops chewing.

""Don't be mad..."" He says.  

I already know. I reach into my bag, and pull out a handful of sardines. 

""God damnit, Lenny!""

I come back from break, and of course, it's a fucking zoo out there. There's a herd of goats trying to get the Turd Slug, something pink is oozing from the ceiling, Chris is wrestling with his hand who's assaulting a customer, Paul is nowhere to be seen, of course, and all the fingers on Headless Elroy's right hand had been chewed down to nubs. He's gonna be so pissed when his head re-spawns. Oh, and the fucking carts didn't get finished. 

I chase the goats outside, stick a bucket under the drip, fill out the accident report for Chris' molested customer, finish stocking the spiders, then go looking for Paul. I found him in the freezer; he'd tripped over one of the bodies and knocked himself unconscious. Fucking idiot. I drag him out and leave him in the warehouse to thaw out for the night, then throw the rest of the empty boxes in the bailer. 

Tilly and Adam were both working tonight, so God knows what kind of biohazard I'm about to walk up to in the front. I pass down aisle 13 on the way. The Spill That Never Dries is growing.  It's eaten the wet floor sign that was next to it; just as I suspected. I put out a new sign, even though it won't last long, then call it a day. 

When I get to the front, I ignore the various smells coming from the register area, then approach the time clock carefully. No Turd Slug, no Fart Cloud, the coast is clear. I punch my number in, and the time clock hadn't stolen any of my time today. I smile triumphantly, turn around, and Paul is standing behind me; shivering and clutching an icicle. He stabs me in the arm with it and tells me I'm a douche bag. I sigh. Maybe I'll call in tomorrow.",3,1736538441.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1hyd38p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hyd38p/previously_posted_worried_er_is_overboard_but_was/,"previously posted, worried ER is overboard but was recommended to go","Hi, I (27F) previously posted about changes in my forehead as well as some neurological changes. I am still having issues, but I am worried going to the ER is overboard. That being said, my doctor quoted me an appointment 2 months out and walk-in isn’t an option. But perhaps waiting would be okay because it’s been a while that I’ve had these symptoms. 

Currently dealing with:
- a widening indent in my forehead that stems from my right eye to a thinning patch of hair 
- the indent hurts like a bruise
- swollen(?) thick hard shiny skin that is worsening and also hurts like a bruise
- headaches, but the type that leaves me feeling like my skull is in between two closing walls. also sometimes feels a bit like an egg that is going to hatch? I know that sounds crazy but it’s somewhat like heart palpitations with the feeling of a butterfly in my chest, but in this case there’s added pressure. That doesn’t hurt though!
- smelling smells that nobody else can smell, sometimes they’re enough to make me gag or not trust the food I was going to eat 
- visual disturbances, like hallucinations kinda? More like when you’re on shrooms and colours are vibrant and things are moving when they shouldn’t. It’s hard to look at my phone and I’ve been using tex to speech a lot. 
- had a seizure like episode that may have been caused by low blood sugar, the doctor I saw said it sounded like a complex partial or something like that
- shaky when I shouldn’t be, sometimes I will pick up a coffee mug and my arm and hand will shake so much it could spill, but the moment I put it down the shaking stops
- hard to get my words out, brain fog is bad but also I feel like I’m just impaired or something
- extreme mood disturbances. Rage and anger out of nowhere that is very very extreme. Very unlike me. I feel like it’s a jekyll and hyde situation
- issues balancing if I can’t see, in the dark I feel like I’m experiencing extreme vertigo
- motion sickness that I had as a young child has come back with a vengeance 
- OCD is worsening 10 fold

Anyways - because this seems less emergent than say a broken bone or direct physical injury, the next time I have any extreme symptoms is the ER overboard? Should I just wait it out? I posted a month or so ago and was recommended to go to the ER but was out of country. I’m back now, but feel like I’d be wasting resources at a time where people are already wasdting them more than usual.

1hyd301,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hyd301/i_am_infatuated_with_this_guy_i_met_only_once/,I am infatuated with this guy I met only once.,"I am 26F and I recently decided to try online dating. For context, I am a very introverted person and was never much into dating. My friends thought it would be a great idea for me to come out of my shell and try meeting new people via dating apps.

So, I matched with this guy, we talked about the basic stuff like hometown, work, etc. and decided to meet. It was late in the evening and we met at a cafe. I immediately felt a connection with him. Although I was awkward at first but eventually got comfortable. We talked and laughed at random stuff and I had a great time overall. Once we were done with our coffee, he suggested that we take a walk in the neighborhood. What I found out then was that his house is very close to the cafe we went. So anyway, we start walking. Again, it's going great. We hold hands and talk about random stuff. I am all heart eyes for him at this point. After walking for a few minutes he tells me we are near his house and I should come inside. I tell him that I need to leave soon. He is a very sweet talker and convinces me to stay for 10 more minutes. I expect that we would be walking around for a while but then he starts leading me inside his apartment. I don't know how I just completely spaced out and by the time I came back to my senses he had locked the door. That's when I told him that I needed to leave. I still tried convincing me to stay but I was firm at that point. I quickly booked a cab and left. I know, it was completely my fault for going to his apartment. I am not a kid and I should have been able to avoid this but it is what it is. Although I haven't dated, I know that it is not normal to invite someone to your house the first time you meet.

When I am back home, he texts me if I would like to meet again. I tell him that I don't want to give him any wrong idea about my intentions as I am strictly not looking for hookups. He is very chill about this and tells me that he understands and had fun meeting me. That should have been the end of it. 

Here comes the part where you might judge me. The next day, whenever I thought back to the date, I could only think of the good stuff. The initial part of the evening where I felt so happy. I started making excuses for him in my head that maybe I overreacted. My friends said that I am not overreacting and I what I did was right. But I still cannot let this go. So I text him asking if he would like to watch a movie sometime. This is how the conversation went overall - 

Me - Would you still like to watch a movie sometime?

He - Hey. I don't feel you are attracted to me at all and I don't see the point of making 'friends' in a dating app so it doesn't make sense.

Me - I was very much attracted to you. What made you feel like I wasn't?

He - I feel I embarrassed myself by trying that hard. When you clearly weren't that much into me.

Me - that's not true.

He - Then why did you leave?

Me - * explaining why I didn't want to go to his house in the first date *

He - So when is the right time according to for this?

Me - Not sure but not the first definitely.

He - For some people, first time works as well. I guess those people just liked me more. You should keep looking for other guys.

Me - *a little hurt* Alright then, I hope you find what you are looking for.

He - I hope the same for you too.

I think the entire conversation translates to this and my friends agree -  ""I don't want to go out with you because you won't have sex with me and you aren't telling me by when you can do it. I don't want to invest my time in that as I am only looking for hookups.""

But, I would like to get an unbiased opinion of strangers. Am I reading too much into this?

Worst of all, I am still pretty much into him. I cannot forget the time we spent together. Please advice. ",1,1736538413.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

This part I'm sure ITA for - because I was so drunk, it was so sudden, and he's now travelling for 5 weeks and we wouldn't see each other, I walked fast down the street to apologize. He said he needed space again, so I went home and left a voice memo apologizing. The next morning I went to his house with coffee to apologize and he didn't answer (yes, showing up is weird - in my defense, exactly 5 days before our fight he showed up unannounced at mine, we hooked up, and he said it was more than just s\*x for him, etc.). He then angrily texted that I need to respect his space.

  
I didn't reach out for 5 days, but wished him a belated merry xmas, no response. Didn't text again for another 5 days, and I wished him a happy NYE, no response. So I went a week, wrote a long, heartfelt apology... no response. Finally today, exactly 3 weeks of not hearing from him at all, I asked for closure. 

  
Yes, I agree, I should have given him more space. In my defense, in November I asked for space once, set a timeline, he reached out within it, I said I need more time, he still interacted on social media, and then when I was ready I told him and we re. But 3 weeks of ignoring me feels harsh...

Obviously I'll never reach out again, but AITA? are we both?

Disclaimer: I'm not Mr Incredible; I have flaws, too. But like everyone here, I'm trying my best to improve.  
  
I started tracking my habits around 2 years ago. At first, it was just for fun—I liked seeing colorful charts and data in my app. I figured it would also help me stay on track, but mainly, I liked knowing I was trying. Over time, I tracked more things—cat litter, meditation, coffee, mood, alcohol, etc. But I realized that tracking didn’t help me create new habits. It just tracked things I was already doing.

What did help me improve was seeing patterns in the data. I noticed things that made me unhappy, like skipping workouts or leaving the litter for days. This pushed me to do better. Habit tracking wasn’t about building habits directly—it was about identifying what I wanted to change. Once I knew what to fix, staying disciplined became easier, and I didn’t need motivation.

**TLDR:** Tracking habits doesn’t create them, but it helps you see what needs improvement. Once you know what to change, discipline becomes easier.

It was 120s/80s before and now it is 130s/90s. However, I'm wondering if it's partially because my ADHD ass makes it impossible to take BP in an optimal way:

My indoor temp reads 59F in the morning, and I get cold pretty easily so I consider that to be too cold for comfort.

I wear a long-sleeve tech tee to sleep so I take off half my shirt to get the cuff on, so I'm even colder.

So now I'm sitting there a bit annoyed because I'm cold and the machine feels like it takes forever going WHIIIRRRRR, WHIIIIRRRRREEEEWWWW. I want to get it over with so I can make coffee or change into my workout clothes and get moving.

Sometimes (not always) my 2nd reading is actually higher than my 1st reading, maybe because I'm growing more impatient sitting there? I try to take a deep breath and focus on a spot on the wall but I'm sure I'm still not 100% relaxed.

I've thought about changing the time I take my BP but I can't think of a better time. I'm only relaxed when I'm in a flow state and if I have to interrupt what I'm doing the take my BP that would automatically make me annoyed because people with ADHD struggle with switching tasks. Also, ADHD makes routines and habits difficult. I already don't take my BP every day despite the daily reminders on my phone, and then with the time blindness too, I'm sometimes shocked it'd been a week or two.

  
Is 59F cold enough to take a difference in BP readings? Should I assume my BP readings just look high because it's impossible to not be at least a little bit annoyed while taking them?",1,1736537985.0,bloodpressure,0,1.0,False

1hycwsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1hycwsg/how_my_girlfriend_beat_candida_overgrowth_and/,How My Girlfriend Beat Candida Overgrowth and Restored Gut Health,"My girlfriend has been struggling with Candida overgrowth for a while. She experienced symptoms like bloating, brain fog, fatigue, poor sleep, night sweats, and digestive issues. After trying strict low-carb and no-carb diets, which helped reduce some symptoms temporarily, the root cause always seemed to come back.

Through trial and error and a lot of research, she’s finally found a sustainable solution that works, and I wanted to share this in case it helps others. 

# Why Cutting Out All Carbs Isn’t the Answer

At first, she eliminated all carbs and fruits to starve the Candida. While this reduced some symptoms, it wasn’t a cure. Candida is incredibly adaptive. Much like the way the body regains weight after extreme keto dieting, Candida can survive without sugar by shifting to alternative metabolic pathways, like consuming fatty acids and proteins.

When carbs were reintroduced into her diet, the symptoms came back, almost as if Candida had been lying in wait. This made us realize that cutting out all carbs wasn’t a sustainable or effective long-term solution.

# The Balanced Approach That Worked

Instead of completely eliminating carbs, she started eating **low glycemic load (GL) and low glycemic index (GI) carbs** in small portions. The key was to create a diet that kept blood sugar stable, denied Candida excessive fuel, and allowed her gut to heal naturally.

Here’s what her current routine looks like:

* **Carbs**: Barley, brown rice, oranges, grapefruit, and berries (in small, controlled portions).
* **Meals**: 25% carb source (e.g., barley), 40% non-starchy vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, spinach, etc.), and 35% lean protein (chicken, fish, beef).
* **Beverages**: She cut down to one cup of low-roast coffee in the morning and replaced subsequent cups with chicory coffee, which is easier on her gut.
* **No Sulfur Supplements**: She stopped taking MSM and other sulfur-containing supplements that seemed to exacerbate her symptoms.
* **Hydration**: Drinks water with mineral salts to stay hydrated and support mineral balance.

# What She Avoids

* **Refined Sugar**: No processed sugars.
* **Starchy Carbs**: Potatoes and white rice are off the table.
* **Sulfur-Rich Supplements**: MSM was cut out as it seemed to worsen her symptoms.

# The Results

The difference has been night and day. Since adopting this approach, her symptoms have significantly improved:

* No more bloating or brain fog.
* Sleep is deep and restful.
* No night sweats.
* Energy levels are back to normal.

# Takeaways

The Candida diet isn’t about eliminating all carbs or being on a keto diet forever. Candida is adaptable and will survive drastic restrictions by shifting its metabolism. The best approach is a **balanced diet that incorporates low-GL carbs in controlled portions** to gradually kill off Candida and restore gut balance.

This balanced method doesn’t just starve Candida—it supports overall gut health, blood sugar stability, and sustainable living.

For anyone struggling with Candida, I highly recommend this approach. It’s been life-changing for my girlfriend, and we hope it helps others too!",4,1736537972.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

I put up a tall cat gate going to the kitchen, and per the vet's advice I keep him in the basement at night where he has access to food, water, litter, toys, bed, blanket, and a cat tree. I have had him since 2021 and he is used to being able to go wherever he wants and sleep on the bed if he so chooses. Before it was not like he slept with me every single night; he just had the option to and was a really chill guy. Ever since I implemented this change 4 months ago, he has been vocal to the point where I cannot enjoy my own home.

THINGS I HAVE TRIED

\-I took him to the vet; he has no underlying medical issues

\-Vet prescribed 100mg gabapentin, it did nothing

\-After several months of 100mg not working, vet changed it to 200mg twice a day and that has not changed his meowing at all

\-I play with him before bed and during the day

\-I spend several hours a day on the couch with him snuggling and hanging out

\-I changed his food to LiveClear to see if that would help my partner's allergies and my partner tried taking allergy medication, but they did not lessen the severity of the allergies

If I go in my room to even change my clothing, he just howls. If I'm on the couch with him and get up to use the bathroom, he cries. He wakes me up during the night with his meowing and I am not getting enough sleep. I can't make a cup of coffee in the kitchen without protesting from him. The funny thing is, it's only when I'm around. When my partner is at home with him, he's fine. No meowing at all, even if my partner goes into the bedroom or kitchen. As soon as I walk out of the door to leave for work, there's silence. He seems to have a really unhealthy attachment to me but I am not going to give up my partner for my cat. I am very sympathetic to the fact that this change must be very hard for him and that's why I have been looping in my vet and being very patient, but I'm starting to wonder if it's in my cat's own best interest to go to a home where he can freely roam where he pleases, because he doesn't seem too happy with this current situation. I know they say it's 3 months to for cats to adjust, but it's been 4 and we've tried medication and I'm not sure what else I can do. I'm so heartbroken and at my wit's end and am seeking advice.

It smells horrible and he doesn’t tie off the bag, so if I’m not super careful my dog could easily get into it too. He also leaves cookies and donuts and food trash all over his couch and coffee table, which we have to walk past every day and the dog could also possibly get that stuff too. I try my best to keep her upstairs to avoid that (and to avoid her eating his cats poop that he only cleans once a week) 

We had another garbage issue last month when he was leaving his trash and bags of dirty cat litter on the front porch by the door. When I tell you the trash bins are literally 10 feet from the door I am not exaggerating. It is RIGHT THERE. He was also piling up his cardboard downstairs to the point I couldn’t reach the fridge or shelves. At that point I also had a talk with him where I honestly was a little rude and told him my patience was gone and called him a hoarder. I did apologize and he cleaned after that but the garbage builds back up a few weeks later.

Between the rotting garbage piling up and the constant smell of cat shit I am fed up and not sure what to do. I moved in last out of everyone and my partner is constantly telling me to get over it and just not let the meds bother me, that he’s a good roommate and we shouldn’t Rock the boat. But he’s a bad roommate. He doesn’t clean up after himself, he leaves trash everywhere, smells, and almost never pays rent or bills on time. Last year when he was sick he also wiped boogers all over the wall and bookshelf in his living room downstairs. 

I guess just venting but also wtf. How do I get him to stop? It’s such a nice house and the rent is super low, I don’t want to move but I don’t know how else to resolve this. ",1,1736537332.0,badroommates,2,1.0,False

In 2024, I was released from federal prison, married the love of my life, welcomed our identical twin boys, and gained two amazing bonus sons. I launched SNIFF, my first crime fiction novel in the SNIFF, SMOKE, SHOOT Series, and started UpCup Koffee, a functional mushroom coffee packed with health benefits.  
  
It’s been a whirlwind of milestones, laughs, hard work, and a lot of late nights, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything. Watching my boys tear into their gifts on Christmas morning, spending time with family, and celebrating these big wins reminded me of just how blessed this year has been.  
  
Now, I’m stepping into 2025 with big goals: enjoying family every day, getting SNIFF into even more hands through IngramSpark and Amazon, publishing new books, book signings, more podcasts, more magazine features, more of everything! And of course, making sure UpCup Koffee finds its way to shelves everywhere.  
  
Here’s to the hustle, the laughter, and the love that makes it all worthwhile. Wishing you a year filled with moments that make your heart full and dreams worth chasing. Let’s make 2025 one to remember!  
  
Happy New Year,

Single male traveling to Portugal end of January until Mid February 2025.
Staying in hotels not AirBNBs.
Lisbon 29 Jan - 4 nights
planning on Cascais, Sintra, Fatima
Porto 2 Feb - 5 nights
Lagos 7 Feb - 3 nights
Lisbon  10 Feb - 4 nights
AM I ok thinking I can take the train from Lisbon>Porto, Porto>Lagos, Lagos>Lisbon?
I enjoy natural beauty.
I like to walk, hike, eat good food(local, traditional),visit museums, points of interest, sit in a cafe and people watch. Not into any extreme activities, surfing, zip-lines ,etc. 
I tend to stay away from tourist heavy stuff, e.g. Tram 28 ? 
Not on social media so unlikely to die trying to get a selfie, although I have seen many beautiful locations  in Portugal while doing research.
Have been many times to EU (Denamrk, Belgium,France,Germany,Italy) & all over UK.  First time in Portugal. Purposely going in off season to get a different( true?) flavor of things. I know I can buy some things in advance to save money, but I do like a less scheduled day so how much more are things when it is spur of the moment. Which transit card is best?
I would like to support smaller shops and restaraunts, suggestions welcome of course. I like the idea of ""discovering"" things on my own since it is after all Portugal,famous for global discoveries, but to know a small coffee shop or restaurants , maybe family run, would be nice. I would prefer to spend my money with Portuguese people not Starbucks or big chain. Feel free to ask me anything and I look forward to some tips. obrigado e até mais, talvez",1,1736536905.0,travel,2,1.0,False

Hi all, I am decluttering and looking to pass on 35 ink samples - these are either ones that I now have bottles of, or ones I have duplicate samples of. SOME OF THESE ARE QUITE OLD. I want to emphasize that. I am giving these away in exchange for you taking on whatever risk may come with using older ink samples. I have no reason to believe there is anything wrong with any of them, and I have only had mold in one ink sample in my \~7 years of using fountain pens, but take whatever precautions you think you need to with mystery ink samples from a stranger. I know that sample of Tsukushi has to be from 2018/2019 - it has an old Goulet label on it that is falling off. But most are from 2022-2024. It's a mixed bag. Samples listed below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading your kitchen not only enhances its functionality but also transforms the space into a personal sanctuary. Whether you're preparing meals, hosting dinner parties, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee, a well-designed kitchen makes a significant difference. Here are some creative home upgrades to consider that blend style and practicality perfectly.

### 1. Open Shelving

Consider swapping upper cabinets for open shelving. This trend makes the kitchen feel more spacious and allows you to display your favorite dishware or cookbooks. You can easily access items, making your kitchen more functional. To keep things organized, use beautiful baskets or decorative boxes to hide smaller items.

### 2. Smart Appliances

Modern technology has taken kitchen appliances to new heights. Smart fridges, ovens, and dishwashers can be controlled from your smartphone. Think about upgrading to these energy-efficient appliances that help streamline your cooking tasks. Not only do they save time, but they can also save you money in the long run.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-upgrades-kitchen  
  
### 3. Stylish Backsplash

An eye-catching backsplash can bring life to your kitchen walls. Choose tiles that reflect your personality. For a trendy look, consider using geometric patterns, bold colors, or even a classic subway tile style for a timeless appeal. A vibrant backsplash can serve as the centerpiece of your kitchen.

### 4. Under-Cabinet Lighting

Good lighting is key to a functional kitchen. Install under-cabinet lights to brighten up your workspace. LED strips are energy-efficient and can be easily installed. This simple upgrade enhances visibility when cooking and creates a warm ambiance for entertaining guests.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-upgrades-kitchen  
  
### 5. Customized Kitchen Island

A kitchen island can serve multiple purposes—preparation space, dining area, and even additional storage. You can customize the height, shape, and storage of your island to match your needs. Don’t forget to include comfy seating if it doubles as a dining area.

### 6. Unique Faucets

Don't overlook the impact of a stylish faucet. A statement faucet acts as both a functional component and an aesthetic feature in your kitchen. Choose sleek designs, color finishes, or even touchless options for added convenience. This upgrade can significantly elevate the overall look of your kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-upgrades-kitchen  
  
### 7. Creative Storage Solutions

Maximize your kitchen’s storage with innovative solutions. Use pull-out pantry shelves, drawer organizers, or vertical storage options to make the most of your space. This not only helps keep your kitchen tidy but also makes finding ingredients and utensils easier.

### 8. Fresh Paint or Wallpaper

A fresh coat of paint or trendy wallpaper can dramatically change your kitchen's vibe. Lighter colors can open up the space, while bold shades can add warmth. Consider painting your cabinets a fun color to give your kitchen a unique touch.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-upgrades-kitchen  
  
### 9. Greenery

Add life to your kitchen with plants. Herbs not only look beautiful but also serve a purpose in your cooking. Consider placing a small herb garden on your windowsill, or use hanging pots for an eye-catching design. Plants improve air quality and can brighten your mood.

### 10. Open Concept Layout

If you’re willing to do a more extensive remodel, think about an open-concept layout. This creates a seamless flow between your kitchen, dining, and living areas. It encourages conversation and connection while providing a modern feel. Remove walls or install a large pass-through window to enhance the space.

These creative home upgrades for your kitchen can greatly enhance your cooking and dining experience. By blending function with style, you can create a space that reflects your personality and meets your daily needs. Whether you choose a simple update or a full renovation, each idea contributes to a more enjoyable kitchen environment.

These upgrades can lead to a kitchen that not only looks fantastic but also works efficiently for your lifestyle. So start planning your upgrades and enjoy transforming your kitchen into a hub of creativity and comfort!

Budget-Friendly Solutions for Kitchen Upgrades That Transform Your Space
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your kitchen is often the heart of your home, a gathering place for family and friends. However, renovations can get pricey. Luckily, there are budget-friendly upgrades that can transform your kitchen without breaking the bank. Let’s explore some creative solutions that can breathe new life into your cooking space.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-upgrades-kitchen  
  
### Paint the Cabinets

One of the simplest ways to upgrade your kitchen is by painting the cabinets. A fresh coat of paint can make them look brand new. You can choose light colors to brighten the space or bold shades for a pop of personality. The best part? All you really need is the paint, primer, and a few basic tools. This can be a fun DIY project if you're up for it!

### Change the Hardware

Another quick and affordable way to elevate your kitchen is by changing the cabinet hardware. Replacing old knobs and handles with trendy options can dramatically change the look of your cabinets. Choose styles that complement your kitchen's theme—be it modern, rustic, or industrial. Don’t underestimate the impact of these little details!

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-upgrades-kitchen  
  
### Update the Backsplash

<div>A new backsplash can really enhance your kitchen’s aesthetics. For budget-friendly options, consider peel-and-stick tiles, which are easy to install and come in various styles. If you prefer a more classic look, you could also paint your backsplash with heat-resistant paint or use stencils for added design.

</div>### Install Open Shelving

Open shelving is not only stylish but also functional. It helps create a sense of openness in the kitchen. You can replace a row of upper cabinets with shelves to display beautiful dishes, plants, or cookbooks. This solution is often more affordable than buying new cabinets and adds a unique touch to your space.

### Upgrade Appliances

New appliances can boost both the functionality and the look of your kitchen. However, you don’t need to purchase all new items at once. Consider buying one or two energy-efficient appliances that fit your budget. Look for sales or discount models to save money while enhancing your kitchen. A newer refrigerator or a stylish microwave can easily enhance the overall vibe.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-upgrades-kitchen  
  
### Light It Up

Lighting plays a critical role in any room, and your kitchen is no exception. Replace old light fixtures with trendy pendant lights or under-cabinet lighting. This can create a warm atmosphere and improve visibility while cooking. Even something as simple as changing out light bulbs to brighter, more energy-efficient ones can make a huge difference.

### Accessorize Smartly

Small accessories can deliver a big impact. Think about adding a new rug, colorful dish towels, or decorative bowls that can brighten the space without costing much. Wall art featuring recipes or cooking themes can also add character and color. These elements help personalize your kitchen and express your style.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-upgrades-kitchen  
  
### Maximize Your Storage

<div>Decluttering and maximizing your kitchen storage can transform the space. Use containers and labels to organize your pantry and countertops. Consider adding a magnetic strip for knives or hooks for pots and pans. These changes not only help save space, but they also make your kitchen more efficient.

</div>### Consider a Countertop Refresh

If replacing countertops is out of your budget, consider resurfacing instead. You can also use contact paper or a countertop kit to give your surfaces a fresh look. Many of these materials mimic expensive stone or wood at a fraction of the cost. Choose attractive options that fit your kitchen theme for a fabulous upgrade.

### Plants for a Fresh Touch

Don’t forget the power of greenery! Adding small potted herbs or succulents can make your kitchen feel fresh and lively. They’re not just decorative; you can use herbs for cooking! Place them on the windowsill or hang them in cute containers. It's an affordable upgrade that enhances both the look and feel of your kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-upgrades-kitchen  
  
By focusing on these budget-friendly kitchen upgrades, you can create a space that feels brand new without spending a fortune. Mix and match ideas to find what fits your style and budget best. With a little creativity and effort, you can turn your kitchen into a space you love for years to come.

### Conclusion

Transforming your kitchen can be a rewarding endeavor that enhances both functionality and style. By exploring creative home upgrades, you can introduce innovative ideas that breathe new life into your cooking space. From smart storage solutions to modern appliances, these upgrades can make your kitchen more efficient and enjoyable to use. Whether it’s adding a fresh coat of paint, installing new countertops, or upgrading your lighting fixtures, each element plays a key role in creating a welcoming atmosphere.

Budget-friendly solutions allow you to enhance your kitchen without straining your finances. Simple modifications, like replacing cabinet hardware, adding peel-and-stick backsplash tiles, or even integrating organizers, can significantly impact your kitchen's look and usability. These affordable upgrades empower you to update your space gradually while maintaining control over your budget. Every small change contributes to a larger vision of a dream kitchen that feels both stylish and functional.

Hello! What’s the easiest commuting route to Valero, Makati? How’s the commuting experience? We’re planning to stay in UrbanFlats for our internship 2pax since it fits our budget and needs, but we’re also considering two other options: Victoria de Makati and 5 Gil Puyat. Which one would you suggest?

Victoria de Makati is the closest to the company,15,000 - 19,000 offering shared living spaces but with private bedrooms. On the other hand, 5 Gil Puyat is more budget-friendly 12,800 and offers fully private accommodations, though we’re unsure about the commuting experience from there. What would you suggest?

1hyby7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hyby7u/my_house_keeps_moving_when_i_sleep/,My house keeps moving when I sleep,"Last week I noticed something strange, when I woke up from an abnormally long sleep my house wasn’t where it was supposed to be. I live in the suburbs of salt lake city Utah in a house that’s pretty old but for some reason when I woke up that day my house was in a field.

A wheat field that seemed to stretch endlessly to the horizon. I couldn’t tell if I was dreaming or not so I just got in bed and closed my eyes. The next thing I knew my house was back where it was supposed to be.

Though that wasn’t the last time this happened. About two days later things started to feel off. Everything felt like a dream, as if nothing was real and it was all in my head. But no matter what I did I couldn’t get rid of the feeling.

Yesterday I noticed that all the plants outside were gone. I looked at doorbell camera footage suspecting they were stolen but from what I saw the plants were never there to begin with. I texted my wife who planted said plants but she claimed she has never brought a plant in or around the house since we moved in.

I called my dad asking him about the plants but he said the same thing. I think im starting to go crazy or something because I could have sworn there was two pots in front of the house with some orange and red flowers and a tree out front. In fact now it seemed that my house was the only one without a tree on the property.

Anyways I have decided to write things down and post them online or where ever I put this for now this Is just a note to myself written on a word document.

I got out of bed this morning and had a donut and coffee for breakfast. My wife leaves for her work earlier than me. It makes the mornings peaceful and quiet. But sometimes, especially times like this it makes me feel quite lonely. When I walked out the front door I looked across the street to see my neighbors didn’t have and trees or bushes. As I turned my head and looked down the street I realized no one had any bushes or trees. Everyone gardens were empty patches of dirt bricks laid in circles around nothing.

A feeling of uneasiness filled me but I decided to worry because it was probably just a dream. I debated whether or not I should still go to work or take the day off. As I stood on my front porch it hit me, if I was dreaming I could wake myself up or at least become lucid. I did everything I could but nothing seemed to work. I walked inside and went to lay down for a bit when I hit my hip on the counter “*FUCK”* I shouted out loud.

The sharp agonizing pain or bumping into a marble corner was indescribable it hurt a million times worse than it should have. I looked at my hip and noticed I was bleeding. It wasn’t bad just a small cut but it still hurt enough for me to call it quits for the day.

When I pulled out my phone to call in sick I couldn’t find my bosses contact. And I couldn’t remember his number, and for some strange reason I couldn’t remember his name or hers i completely forgot what they looked like what they sounded like. And then I couldn’t remember where I worked.

I sat down trying to think but I started to question if I even had a job. Nothing felt real and I had no idea what was happening.

I think I just need to get some sleep.

I woke up to loud bang.

I jumped out of bed dazed and confused I was sweating and I couldn’t remember what I was doing asleep so late until I saw my laptop open beside me. I heard footsteps that crept closer to the door. “WHO ARE YOU” I shouted the bedroom door swung open and I saw my wife. “Your home? This early?” I asked “its seven, I’m late.” “oh shit its seven but that doesn’t make any sense. I feel like just two minutes ago I was going to go to work but then some weird stuff happened, and speaking of that I need to tell yo…” “work? You got a job?”

“what do you mean you got a job?”

“you said you were going to work why didn’t you tell me that you got a job?”

“What are you saying I’ve had this job for ten years I- I don’t know what else to say.”

“Are you okay?”

“well no there’s a bunch of weird stuff happening and I’m losing my mind about it”

“like the plants you wont shut up about”

“well yeah but the neighbors don’t have any plants didn’t you see?”

“honey you need to get some rest, I don’t know what has gotten into you.”

“what?”

My wife never called me honey before

“its just you need to sleep”

“I’ve been sleeping. ”

“well okay then. I need to run to the store and buy some dogfood.”

“What? For who?”

“for us silly.”

Her voice sounded strange. Monotone and lacking any emotion at all

“while I’m gone you should really go sleep”

“No, What do you mean for us?”

“for our dog its hungry”

“We don’t have a dog”

She looked at me with a blank stare and said

“I don’t know what your talking about he’s right outside.”

I turned around and looked out the back door and saw a small sheep dog running around on a yard full of dirt I couldn’t remember if there was grass in the backyard and then I started to remember having a dog.

I looked back at my wife and I couldn’t seem to fully recognize her. Her face felt off. I could recognize her voice even the strange way she was talking to me but her face I just couldn’t remember even when looking directly at her. I made myself dinner and went to my bed but my wife never came to join. I shouted her name a few times until I forgot what her name was. It was like I had been shouting gibberish I got out of bed and felt lost.

I walked around the dark house that now felt like I different world and couldn’t find my wife but then it hit me a realization, a fear. I was alone. And I never had a wife. I keep reading this over and over and over again but I cant remember anything I didn’t type in the last five minuets.

I’m losing my mind.

I have decided to just go to sleep and figure things out in the morning.

I woke up around 3 ish in the morning I was cold so I got up to turn on the heater but when I looked outside I saw a forest I ran to every window in the house to be met with the same sight. A pitch black forest, one of those it eats you alive forests. I couldn’t believe what my eyes were seeing I decided to go back to sleep and pray that this was just some weird dream but as I was getting in bed I saw a not on my nightstand it read “*don’t talk to them, don’t listen to them, don't look at them and never leave the house.”*",3,1736535594.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Anyways, I went on a date with a girl and from the get go she seemed like she wasn't much into texting so I matched her energy and I had no problem with that, I value quality over quantity and face to face interactions over text anyways.

We grabbed a coffee and went for a stroll next to a waterfront. Conversation felt effortless and for the most part it was light hearted and playful. At the end of the date we both said we'd like to see each other again and I was like ""I really want to kiss you right now"" and she chuckled and she agreed and we kissed each other good bye. She told me to message her once I get home and I did, she just said ""Thanks for today, I really enjoyed it x"".

A day after, I decided to ask her whether she'd be up to go to an arcade and we were mid-way planning it and she seemed enthusiastic but mid way through she just ghosted me.

The only thing that can come to my head which wasn't ""light hearted"" during our date was when she brought up and asked about past relationships and she said that she sometimes feel scared that relationships can take away freedom and she referred to her past relationship. I disagreed and I said that it depends on the other person and I ended up sharing about my past relationship and I just told her what I learned from it and may have shared some details (not too much) that I could have kept but I only framed it as learning and growing from experience. - This probably isn't the reason why it's just the only thing that can come to my mind because it genuinely felt great.

Another thing is that I don't like or have it in me to break physical barriers off the bat but rather get to know a person before becoming comfortable but I get that it can be a turn off for some people I guess.

I would like to have your opinions in order to put together a build which aim is to run recent games in 4K at 60FPS in ""the worst case"".  
My use of the PC is mainly for video games and spending time on the Internet.  
  
My current build dates from 2019. This is what it consists of at the moment for your information:  
  
Case: Be quiet! BGW25 Orange PC case  
SSD: SAMSUNG 860 EVO 250 GB  
Cooler: NOCTUA NH-U12S  
RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz C16 XMP 2.0  
Motherboard: Gigabyte Z390 GAMING X Intel Socket LGA 1151 motherboard  
Processor: INTEL I7-9700K Coffee Lake R LGA 1151  
GPU: VGA GIGABYTE RTX 2080S GAMING OC 8G  
PSU: be quiet! Pure Power L8 Modular ATX 630W Power Supply 80 Plus Bronze certification  
Screen: BenQ ZOWIE XL2411P 24 inches, 144hz  
  
  
I have already purchased a screen which will complete the new build which is the MAG 321UPX QD-OLED  
  
My budget would be €2500 (I could spend a little more if there is ever a good deal in terms of performance to be had).  
  
I don't know yet if I'm going to change the case or keep the same one and I'm not tempted to spend more just for RGB on the components.  
  
For the build I would only have one request, it is that it can be built around a 5080 (hoping that I manage to get my hands on one at launch)  
  
Thank you for your help!  
  
Happy New Year 2025 everyone!Hello everyone,",0,1736534991.0,buildapc,1,0.33,False

I'm looking for some fun and I'm hoping you do too! It's fair to say that I'm captain sensible *most of the time*. I'm nerdy, well-educated, and work a professional job in the city. That said, sometimes I just want to do something crazy and fun. Life is short, so why not enjoy it?

I'm looking for somebody that is confident, open-minded, and is up for having some fun whatever form that takes. I'm super easygoing, so anything from chats, meeting up, and a lot more besides is all good with me. What's on your bucket list?

To describe myself a bit: I'm a native Londoner, average height and weight, shaved head and bearded (the Redditor look), well-groomed, and DDF. I'm attractive and easy in conversation. I'm a big lover of music and enjoy discovering new bands, so if you have any faves then send them my way. Otherwise, I enjoy the usual 30 something activities like video games, reading, running, and overpriced coffee.

1hybo6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hybo6g/some_insight_between_the_philips_3200_lattego_and/,Some Insight between the Philips 3200 Lattego and the Delonghi Magnifica Plus,"On a weekly basis there are usually a bunch of questions on whether someone should choose a Philips 3200/4300/5400 or another machine so I figured I would provide some insight to those who might be on the fence on which to choose.  For some quick backstory I was a former Kuerig/Nespresso user who wanted  to move to a SA for the combination of those two machines as well as ""level up"" in my coffee experience.  Christmas of 2020 I purchased the Philips 3200 Lattego.  After dialing in the machine and settling on recipes I came to the conclusion that coffees/americanos from the 3200 blew away the taste and quality of the Kuerig pods. The Lattes and Cappuccino's were also very good. When it came to espresso though, some were good, some were so/so.  I always felt that the flavor/intensity of the Nespresso pods on average on par with this machine.

  
As a frequent visitor of this sub, I would see how often comments would rave about Delonghi and Jura machines (And now KA) and I just couldn't give the same type of review for the Philips.  Again the coffee is good, but not great. When I would get fresh beans from local roasters and open the package up, Americanos that day and the day after would be very good, but a few days later the taste would fall off significantly as the beans began to oxidize in the hopper.  Store bought beans often would make average coffees.  Lattes and Cappuccinos were still good, but that is because they are essentially coffee flavored milk so coffee intensity is always muted.

  
I started having a bit of FOMO around Christmas time this year seeing all the new reviews from various machines that people got over the holidays and went back to re-dial in my 3200 by messing with grind settings and ratios seeing if I could improve the taste of espresso. When I was unsuccessful in tasting any meaningful change, I started looking into what machine I would want if I decided to upgrade.  I initially was trying to decide between the Delonghi Magnifica Plus, the Jura E6, and the Kitchenaid K7. The Jura E6 was outside my price range and honestly because there has been so many posts on Kitchenaid devices and yet so little on youtube reviewing KA's, I was worried it was getting a little GME Wallstreet Betish and that it might be a bit of a marketing gimmick(Not saying it is, it was just my personal perception). After watching a bunch of reviews, I decided on the Magnifica Plus since I found it on sale for $900.

  
I have had the machine for a few days now and I have to say the quality of drinks from the Delonghi vs the Philips is night and day.  Using the same beans i had been using in my Philips, my coffee now has taste again and more importantly body.  Americanos and long coffees have flavor and bold intensity.  The espressos blow away anything that was made from the Nespresso and the 3200.  The Crema it produces is also significantly better.  Obviously the increase in the types of drinks it makes and the fact that it has a touchscreen that is easy to navigate is a huge plus. I know this machine is an upgrade over the philips and that it is not an apples to apples comparison vs the 3200, but the Magnifica Evo is and that machine produces the same core drinks as the Plus.

  
While waiting for my Plus to arrive I found this review of the 3200 by Tom's coffee and it perfectly summarizes my feelings on the 3200. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPLrEOgN6SE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPLrEOgN6SE) To be fair the coffee crema he made used too much water as he chose the max water setting. But even with lower water ratios, I feel the result is the same. The espresso setting was on the lowest water setting so that is an accurate result.  I think his comment on the max dose of 8grams means that the Philips brewgroups cannot hold the volume of grounds that other devices can and therefore cannot match the strength of dose that those machines.

  
So TL/DR if you are someone who doesn't like/need bold coffee, but wants something much better than a Kuerig, then the Philips would work fine for you as a starter machine.  If you are someone who like myself was chasing a much bolder and stronger flavor, then I would go with the Plus or Evo.",1,1736534902.0,superautomatic,1,0.67,False

We are both in a relationship, but something has drawn us together since the first time we met at work. Common topics and interests, so a colleague also became a personal trainer. I work out 3 times a week and we also meet at work, where we have coffee together or just talk about everything. We write to each other almost daily, we share photos of secluded cabins where we would like to get away from it all. We wrote messages that suggested something more than a friend, especially hints that we would miss him and that things had ""moved somewhere"" since the first time we met. Morning and evening messages too, sometimes he first, sometimes I first. When he is away from home, he talks more, when his partner is not home we can also call each other. Once we went inline skating together after work, then we wanted to go hiking together twice, which he couldn't do because of work obligations. He always apologized. Later he started touching me more on my sides, arms, back, he patted my thigh a few times, I did the same, but more carefully. Drinking coffee is our time almost after every training and also at work. The topics of our conversations deepened, including about my relationship problems and that's why he doesn't like my partner. The coach has a partner 20 years younger than him, but he doesn't want children anymore and therefore he knows that the relationship with her is not permanent. After one training session, he invited me to lunch. The next day he received a Christmas present from me and immediately asked for ""at least a hug"" and we kissed on the cheek. After another training session, I received a gift from him. Then he wanted to take me from the gym to the car, when we were sitting in his car, he wanted to wish me a happy new year and then he leaned towards me and I felt like he wanted to kiss me. I kissed him on the cheek because I was a little scared and put my arm around his neck. We haven't had a chance to be alone since then, but I feel like it's my turn now. His partner was at training today and he stroked her so nicely that it makes me sad. Is this a sign that he wants to be more than a colleague, coach and friend? I apologize for my bad English, I only speak a little. We send each other photos of our lives, sometimes with our legs spread while relaxing, but not intimately.",1,1736534877.0,u_Virtual_Glass_8238,0,1.0,False

I (25f) met an older guy (39m) at a bar through mutual friends. We seemed to hit it off, talked for hours, good banter. We exchanged Instagram handles and met the next day for coffee before I had to leave town to go back home. Anyways. 
I messaged him on Instagram and shot my shot, asked him out and gave him my number. He accepted and texted me. He even said he’d meet me halfway between our cities so I didn’t have to come all the way to meet him. 

He had been leaving me on delivered for days and then apologizing for not responding, and he even said “I’m not trying to blow you off.” The thing is, I can see when he is active on Instagram, but he won’t reply to texts. It’s only been 2 weeks since we saw each other last and I don’t want to have to chase a man to try and set up a time to meet him again. 

I have gotten varied opinions from friends- my younger (same age as me) friends think I should stop replying and stop reaching out. My older friends all think I’m probably overthinking things, and he is probably just overwhelmed with life. 

I have a lot of self esteem issues that stem from my weight problem, so I was really excited that a man I was attracted to and had chemistry with wanted to see me again, but now I’m feeling down and like he regretted saying yes in the first place. 

The last message I sent him was to the effect of “ball is in your court, if you want to meet me for coffee, you’ll have to let me know if there is a date that works for you.” 

This might be more of a rant than anything, but since my friends opinions vary so much on what I should do, I figured I’d ask Reddit. Should I continue to reach out first, or should I pretend I never got excited about a man and just leave him be? ",6,1736534840.0,dating_advice,17,1.0,False

Did I just buy a crappy brand or are all kpods like this? I am not a coffee expert but I do cook and I understand good ingredients get you a better dish and home cooked from scratch is always best tasting and best value.

“So what’s the damage?” Josh walked into the mess and headed straight to the drink dispenser, barely sparing a glance at Alex as he and his white winged shadow were poring over an array of quickboards in front of them.

“Depends. Do you enjoy the idea of not getting motion sick during shuttle transit?” Alex knew that Josh had a strong preference to avoid zero-G whenever possible. He could handle it in short bursts but anything longer than half an hour tended to make him rather violently ill. “Bare-bones starts at four-sixty k. If we want to get something on par with what we had before, with keplite inertial control and artificial gravity then we're up to one-point-three mil.”

“Uh huh. And how much did we get after the previous run? Just before we made first contact? We found a shitload of cobalt that time.” Josh punched up a button and watched as a clear plastic glass tumbled into place, only to be rapidly filled with bright orange juice.

“Six-seventy two before the split. After fabber restock, maintenance, docking fees, and the crew split I walked away with around one-fifty. Meaning we’d have to do that nine times to pay off a new shuttle. That was a three-month stint, so bit over two more years - assuming we get such a high payday every time.” Alex glanced down at the quickboard in front of him, and the calculations he’d already made on it. “Not every run is that rich, of course, so that two years could easily stretch out to three or more.”

“Well another few years of boring mineral runs isn’t the worst thing that could happen.” Josh pointed out, and Alex shrugged.

“The thing is, that’s just to get us to where we were before all this. I kinda hoped we’d be able to, y’know, advance a little bit.” Alex reached over and picked up a cold piece of buttered toast, taking a big bite. “M-ybe m-ke” he swallowed heavily, ”some improvements to the ship, or something. Plus that’s years spent away from Kiveyt. Call me selfish but after being the one to make first contact and working my butt off to try to improve relations, I sorta want to be there to see the results of my work, y’know? It’d be nice if Sophie and Trix didn’t have to spend years away from home.”

“I’ve done it before. I’m sure I can do it again if needs must.” Sophie assured him.

“Yeah, but just because you CAN doesn’t mean you SHOULD.” Alex responded.

“Does this mean you’re not going to stay here with Asylum?” Josh asked, and Alex shrugged again.

“It’s still an option on the table, even if I’d prefer something else. I’ve pretty much given up on the ‘don’t claim asylum and live a life on the run’ option though.”

“Why’s that? We have a fabber with most necessary modules. No reason we couldn’t live a few decades or more off the grid.” Josh took a seat and carefully scooted several of the quickboards with shuttle models off to the side.

“Chemistry. Or more specifically, chemicals. Inorganics are easy enough to get in any asteroid field or system, but if we want to get some of the more important ones for, say, Trix’s hormonal supplements or the micro-nutrients that we go through on the regular for both our species we’d have to have the fabber running chem synthesis more or less twenty four seven. A dedicated chemfab would do it faster, easier, and with a lower power draw… but that’d be an extra three mil and a moderate retrofit.”

“Ouch. What about ducking into one of the more… introverted colonies out there?” Josh continued to sip idly as he conversed.

“Name one that isn’t full of weirdos, nutjobs, or criminals that isn’t cozy with Proxima.” Alex said sourly, then shook his head. “I’ve come at this six ways from Sunday and so far come up with nothing. Any luck on your end?”

“Nada. It’d probably help if I had a major social life off this ship so I could make contacts or something, but since I don’t…” He shrugged nonchalantly.

“I’ve submitted a request to the local AIs but thus far the collective response has been that we lack sufficient information to judge the best move forward.” A voice from the overhead intercom interjected as Par made his digital presence known. “Primarily in the form of additional information about the Bunter’s technological and military options.”

“Oh? Lemme hear more about that.” Alex prompted him.

“If - and the word is stressed quite strongly here - Kiveyt was willing to stand up to the Bunters, and if Humanity were to back them, both of which are uncertain, what level of support would be necessary? How many ships, how large, and in what numbers would we need to even consider being able to adequately protect the planet?”

“You think they’d go to war over me?” Sophie asked with a note of dread in her voice.

“We don’t know. On the surface it seems doubtful, as the Bunters seem to be profit-driven and your punishment gains nothing of notable value. That, however, is looking at this from the lens of Humanity - being an alien species to us, their thoughts may differ greatly.” Par admitted.

“So we have no real clue.” Alex said with regret, then turned to Sophie. “You’re more familiar with them than we are, angel. Any chance you can give us some insight?”

Sophie brought her wings in tighter to her back as she thought about that. “That’s a tricky question. On the surface ‘profit driven’ seems like the best description, but at the same time they often surprise me. Since they all gamble Gatha so much and so often, most of my dealings with them in my job were related to that. I tried watching them when they did so, thinking I could maybe figure them out - but it was nonsensical. One individual I watched was on a winning streak, yet the more he won the angrier he got. Yet another gained something of a jackpot and was elated. I never understood the difference between the two.”

“I still don’t get that whole ‘Gatha’ thing. It’s currency, but they can’t spend it? Why do they collect it?” Josh frowned as he thought back to the Bunters that were on the station.

“I once had a colleague sit down and try to explain it to me. He spoke of terms that still don’t make much sense to me. Somehow it’s sort of… quantified respect, or influence? Which is already difficult enough to try to imagine.” Sophie held up her hands in an uncertain gesture. “And gambling with it shows bravery, a willingness to put something of value on the line. Winning or losing can both be respected so long as the individual is willing to engage. It’s also important for them mentally, but I understood his explanation of that even less.”

Alex frowned as he thought about that. “How does the gambling den actually make money then? They can’t take a cut from the gambling proceeds if they aren't gambling with actual money.”

“Food and drink sales along with a Hegemonic subsidy for those types of businesses.” Sophie answered much quicker now that the conversation had strayed into a topic she actually understood. “Since the gambling parlors are important for a Bunter’s mental well being the government ensures that all stations have at least a few.”

“As fascinating as this dive into Bunter sociology is,” Par interrupted them, “it unfortunately does not help us understand how they’ll react to defiance from Kiveyt in the form of withholding Sophie from them. Nor does it help us understand what level of military response would be necessary to safeguard the Avekin.”

“Yeah, yeah. Right now it sounds like the best bet is that Ji and Min figure out a way to disguise the Arcadia. And if we’re extremely lucky they can do it for…” Alex pulled out the quickboard that contained the current contents of his bank account. “Less than one-hundred ninety-three thousand credits.”

“Hold off on any big purchases.” Amanda walked into the mess and took a seat, before her gaze began to wander across the array of boards and the shuttles displayed on that. “We’ve got a big meeting with TF tomorrow. They’re going to be sending a pickup at eight AM local.”

“Ugh.” Alex immediately slumped down in his seat. “Do I have to?”

“You’re the one who wanted to explore every option.” Amanda said primly. “If they have an idea to present, wouldn’t you want to hear it?”

“Maybe. I dunno.”Alex took a deep breath as he thought on that. “It’s not that I don’t appreciate ‘em, but I kinda really want to put my mineral surveying days behind me.”

“Well, I’d say before you make any choice at all about the future you should address the issues of the present.” Amanda frowned and gestured at the quickboards. “You don’t have a shuttle, you don’t have a plan to keep Sophie from being executed by the Bunters. Terrafault could easily provide you with both, you know.”

“Yeah, it’s how I’d pay them back for it that I don’t like. No offense, Amanda, you and the company aren’t evil or nothing but I’m about as interested in being a corpo slave as I am in getting a female body mod. It ain’t for me.”

Amanda rolled her eyes at that. “Fine then. Tell them no in person if you must, but you’re GOING to have to go with me to the meeting either way. Unless you’ve forgotten, TF picked up the tab on bailing you out when you smashed up that conference room on Farscope, and given how much cash you said you have on hand just now paying that back will put you in the negatives. So unless you want to try to figure out how to handle paying the crew, disguising the arcadia, and buying a shuttle when you’re worth less than nothing you’re coming with.”

“Fine, fine.” Alex pushed himself to his feet and gestured to Sophie. “If we’re going to be wading through the corporate bullshit tomorrow then let’s get some relaxation in while we can. That Davy Jones show you were telling me about must have been downloaded by now, we can watch it together.”

“What about…” Sophie gestured down to the tablets. “All of this?”

“It’ll have to wait until after we deal with the corporate slavemasters.” Alex gave Amanda a withering glare, and she responded with a bright and sunny smile just to spite him. He scowled harder, and left the room with Sophie rapidly moving to catch up.

“That was mean.” Josh gave her a big grin, and took an equally big gulp of juice. “Ever since the Avekin showed up, you’ve been nicer. Now you’re back at being bitchy?”

“It got him to agree to come along.” Amanda stood up and walked over to the dispenser, coming back with a steaming mug of black liquid. “In the end it’s my job. If HQ wants him to show up for a meeting, my job is to convince him to do so. If ‘asking nicely’ would work then I’d do that, but since you and I both know it won’t then ‘being bitchy’ it is.”

“Alright. You think they’ve got a way for us to keep her safe?” Josh gestured towards the door with his now-empty glass.

“They have money, manpower, influence…” Amanda shrugged in response. “We have too little of all three. They’re our best bet so far. Unless you happen to be the long lost secret son of a powerful leader of industry?”

“You’re thinking Al should ask his Dad for help?” Josh’s amused demeanor immediately vanished, and he leaned forward over the table. “Cause I gotta say of all the options, that one in particular seems especially bad.”

“I’m not saying that, exactly…” Amanda bit her lip and shook her head. “I just wanted someone else to hear about it first. Going to his father would be an option. Is it the best option? I doubt it. But it should be considered.”

“Why? You know how he is about his dad’s abandonment.” Josh stood up and walked the glass over to the return receptacle. “What makes you think that’d be something he should even consider?”

“Mainly because I suspect his love for Sophie is greater than his hatred for his father. If we can’t come up with something better, I’m going to suggest it. And I’d like your support if I do.” Amanda sipped cautiously at the hot, bitter coffee.

“You want ME to support an idea like that?” Josh whirled and stared incredulously at Amanda.

“If Sophie gets thrown to the wolves, Alex will jump in after her.” Amanda pointed out. “He’s stupid and infatuated. They’ve been together for all of two months, and he’s acting like she’s the only one for him. So even if it accomplishes nothing, he’d do it. If we can give him an alternative that keeps her alive and well, HE stays alive. And, presumably, as well as he can be.”

Josh frowned as he considered that. “You don’t know for a fact that she ISN’T the one for him.  I don’t know that either. What I do know is I’ve never, ever seen him like this before. So maybe it’s worth a deal with the devil if it means they get the opportunity to find out if this really is the right thing for the both of ‘em.”

Amanda snorted at that. “Love at first sight? Really? I thought you’d be more realistic than that.”

“Hey, just because it’s unlikely doesn’t mean it’s impossible.” Josh countered. “I mean, if you think about all the other wild coincidences we’ve encountered, it doesn’t even seem like the most improbable thing for us, does it?” He waved as he walked out the door, leaving Amanda to nurse the cup of coffee in front of her.

“I wonder just how much he knows… or suspects…” She murmured quietly, then stood up herself to return to her cabin.

“...in order to carve out a niche in the incredibly competitive minerals market, Terrafault decided to focus on quality instead of quantity. While unable to match or compete with the mass production of larger companies like Stardust or Ecamsil, we have firmly established ourselves as the industry leader in the acquisition of rare and exotic minerals for specialty applications.”

The cheery, brainless babble of the woman on the wallscreen managed to almost entirely destroy the pleasure of the trip. Ever since their arrival in Proxima, Alex and the crew had been given the VIP treatment throughout the systems. Yet this shuttle was above and beyond even that - clearly meant to impress someone. The seating was sinfully comfortable, a full bar and countertop mealfab had an incredible array of refreshments able to be prepared in under a minute, even the air itself had just a hint of some kind of perfume. One which, Alex was sure, was probably unimaginably expensive and rare.

Unfortunately the one luxury it didn’t seem to have was a mute for the Terrafault sales pitch they were subjected to. The volume was fairly low but the soundproofing of the interior was nearly flawless - the cheerful voice cut through the silence effortlessly.

“Gosh, what an impressive company. I sure am glad they’re going above and beyond to try to fill Sophie’s head with interminable praise for themselves.” Alex slouched deep into the seat. A fully stocked bar with all sorts of delicious cocktails and Amanda had stopped him after he barely started to feel a buzz.

“You do realize this is what they break out for the big investors?” Amanda ignored the wall ad, and with more difficulty ignored Alex as she caught up on the news downloads on her quickboard. Not much else to do on this trip other than keep her second boss from getting shitfaced before they reached TF HQ. “You might have lost a billion plus credits, but you’re being treated like a half-trillionaire with this trip.”

“I’m pretty sure they’re not treating ME with any particular reverence. My lover, on the other hand…”

Sophie raised an eyelid to glance over at Alex, then gave him a silent smile and let her eye close. She didn’t know what the scent in the air was but it was incredibly relaxing, and she’d discovered rather quickly that the seats had a ‘massage’ function that was downright heavenly. Minute force fields pushed up and down, in circles, and with varying amounts of power in an addictive manner. She was too tall to enjoy it in a single seat, but with only Alex and Amanda present there was enough leftover room for her to sprawl out on several, and enjoy the sensation far more.

“Your lover, on the other hand, may just sign on to anything they propose if it means getting a shuttle like this one.” Sophie said with relish as she relaxed.

“Hedonist.” Alex said with a smile, then glanced over at Amanda. “So what’s going to be on the agenda when we arrive?”

“Paperwork, obviously.” Amanda didn’t even bother to look up at him as she answered. “You kept putting it off last time we were in system in the name of ‘escort duty’. Well, you need to sign off on everything you did in Perseus and on Kiveyt, so bare minimum that’s waiting for you. Then you’re going to sit down with procurement and make a plan about a replacement shuttle. Finally, remote ops is going to go over your options on how to address the Farscope situation. I may have gotten the order mixed up, but those are going to be the highlights.”

Alex sighed with irritation and nodded his head towards the Avekin lounging nearby. “And Sophie? You expressly told me for the two of us to be ready for this visit.”

“Because unlike you I listen, even if I’m not entirely pleased with what I hear. You two have gone on and on about how you have to stick together during this courtship process, so rather than try to argue the point I just worked around it.” Amanda finished the page she was on, and set the board down on the seat next to her.

“Okay. And that’s the ONLY reason?” Alex pressed, and Amanda rolled her eyes.

“Of course not,. TF is going to be investing heavily into the Avekin. We have a major interest in making sure that investment goes well, and as you can imagine a part of that involves directly meeting with Sophie.”

Sophie looked up at that. “Should we have brought Trix along? She IS the ambassador, after all.”

Amanda eyed the larger woman for a bit, then nodded. “On paper, yes. In reality everyone in this shuttle knows that you’ve got her beat several times over in experience and the company isn’t interested in looking good for the press. They want to speak with someone more worldly. Someone like you.”

“And?” Alex pressed. “What more aren’t you telling us?”

Amanda just shook her head at that. “You know everything I do about today’s plans. If there’s anything else, you’ll find out about it at the same time I will.”

Alex’s eyes narrowed suspiciously, but he seemed to accept that as he slouched back into the cushioned seat. “Hey, they’re talking about you!” Amanda suddenly said as the cheery voiceover began to hype up the ‘excellence of their dedicated and courageous surveying corps’. Alex gritted his teeth and tried his best to ignore the jargon as he willed the shuttle to arrive at HQ that much faster.

—--

After the luxurious and ostentatious ride, Alex expected a grand welcome at Terrafault. A lineup of execs, each one eager to shake Sophie’s hand or offer him some platitudes about the job he’d done in Perseus. To arrive and leave with hardly anyone batting an eye was surprising (And, perhaps, just a TINY bit disappointing - not that he’d ever admit it). Sophie, as usual, got more than a few glances, long looks, and even one wolf-whistle from somewhere in the docking area but aside from the whistle that was the norm whenever she or Trix stepped foot somewhere new. Amanda didn’t take any time to talk, and instead took off into the station with a brisk pace that forced Alex to jog slightly to catch up.

“I have a question.” Sophie asked, as they moved through the hallways. “I’m taller than any human I’ve seen to date. So why did you build this station so big even I can’t reach the ceiling?”

“It’s not that big everywhere.” Amanda glanced up as if noticing the size of the hallway for the first time. “When we reach administration it’ll be more… us sized. But this thoroughfare connects directly to the docking area, and it’s sized for whatever kind of equipment may need to be moved through.”

“I thought HQ was more or less purely admin.” Alex noted, and Amanda shook her head.

“The station was built for expansion. Right now about a third or so of it it in use for Administration, communication, recordkeeping and the like. Eventually we’ll use it all up, but until then the unused space is functioning as a makeshift depot. This is our door.”

Amanda turned on the spot and led them through a narrow hallway into a large, open area full of cubicles. Strips of blue glowing lights ran along the top of each area, and the sound of muted voices filled the room and gave a sense of liveliness. Amanda walked along, before stopping at a large wall covered with cubbies full of paper. As she began to pull forms from various different cubbies and assembling them in her arms. “New contractor registration, insurance, benefits…” she muttered as she did so.

“Let this be a valuable lesson, Sophie.” Alex said wth disgust. “Fusion power? Particle Generators? Fission reactors? They all sound impressive, but in reality Human existence is powered through sheer mindless volumes of paperwork.”

“Can it. You know how important these are.” Amanda retorted.

Alex snorted at that. “Important? I signed each and every one of these - in TRIPLICATE - digitally on the quickboards. You have copies of each. Par has copies of each. I wouldn’t be surprised if Mother herself has copies stored somewhere on fuckin’ LUNA. And you still want me to sign more!”

“Protocol is protocol, no matter how much you whine and complain. I’d have thought you’d learn by now that no amount of-”

“Now, now, Miss Teltsin. The good captain has a point.” Amanda stopped mid-sentence as a new voice interjected. Her head whipped around to see the tall form of her boss standing nearby. “Protocol and formality are important, but given the rarity of our company, I think we can bend the rules ever so slightly.”

“Sir.” Amanda immediately shoved the paper into an empty cubby and smoothed out her attire. “I’m sorry, I hadn’t expected you to be here. Miss Sophie, Mr Sherman, allow me to introduce you two to Walter Prest - the head of Remote Operations here within the company.”

Sophie had grown accustomed to the human greeting, and offered her hand. “Remote Operations?”

“Business outside of Sol and Proxima space.” Walter shook her hand warmly, then turned to Alex who just nodded instead. “Surveying and mining in outer systems.”

Amanda reached out to take the stack of paper back from the cubby she’d hastily shoved it into. “I’m sorry, sir. I was told that onboarding would be the first precedence of the day, so I-”

“Yes, I realized as much when Security saw you divert. Apparently the updated itinerary hadn’t reached you before you left.”

“Sir?”

“Cohren superseded the original plan. We’re heading to the exec level conference suite.” Prest poked his head into one of the nearby cubicles and said something that Alex couldn’t quite make out, before its occupant jumped up and grabbed the stack of paper from Amanda’s hands. “Come on. Leave those.”

Alex and Sophie fell in behind the taller dark-haired man as he moved swiftly through the room, past the cubicles back into the main hallway they’d just arrived from. Amanda followed behind, having to almost jog to keep up as she glanced confusedly at the back of her boss’s form. The group moved swiftly down a hundred yards before reaching a huge circular elevator. Two men were already present there, holding it while the group got on.

As they arrived at the executive floor the elevator opened up to a huge atrium. Water burbled and splashed softly in pools and ponds, surrounded by grass and plants. A gentle murmur of voices slowly transformed into muted, hushed whispers as people noticed the group exiting the elevator and striding towards Central Executive. Sophie’s presence wasn’t a surprise to anyone there - every occupant of the Atrium was knowledgeable enough about the company’s activities to realize that a visit from the Avekin was going to be inevitable, but despite that she was still a rare sight to behold.

Glass doors swung open automatically as the party advanced through the atrium into the offices, and almost immediately they found themselves facing a massive, thick wooden door. It, took, slid easily open and as the group walked in, Alex caught a glimpse of metal on the floor - a seam, running right along the center of the door’s position. He was about to comment on it when the situation caught up to him.

The conference table inside was almost plain until he recognized it was made from a single, perfectly cut and polished piece of wood. That fact was obvious from the consoles inlaid at each station - more modern materials could have had those consoles hidden below a panel, or been an integral part of the table. Yet the size itself was telling, as no terrestrial tree could have produced such a massive slab - meaning it was almost definitely an expensive import from a life-bearing exoplanet. It could easily seat two dozen, yet there were only five people present.

At the head of the table a lanky old man with an impressive moustache sat, arms on the table, hands lightly cupped together. Alex nearly burst out laughing the moment he saw him, as the man was seated directly in front of a portrait of himself, wearing a nearly identical outfit, in the exact same pose. “Okay, that’s got to be on purpose, right?”

Walter halted and turned to look at the Captain with confusion, but Alex just waved at the man seated at the head of the table. “Oh. Yes, it is. Allow me to introduce you to Findlay Cohren, CEO of Terrafault.”

“Yeah, I gathered that from the plaque under the portrait. First time meeting you though.” Alex stood there and glanced around at the people assembled. “I guess I don’t have to guess what this is about then.”

“It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Findlay said solemnly, then glanced over at Amanda.

“Sir, please don’t take his rudeness as a sign of disrespect, he just…” she quickly began but ran out of steam trying to come up with some kind of excuse or explanation for Alex’s brusque speech.

“He’s just like you said, I know.” Findlay stood up, and walked over to face Alex and Sophie. “Most of our independent contractors can be rather recalcitrant towards the corporate structure. He simply takes it further than most.”

“Yeah, well, I appreciate the opportunity and it’s thanks to TF that I was in the right place at the right time and so on and so forth et cetera.” Alex folded his arms. “Oh, and I’m extremely sorry for all the times I was less than delicate and diplomatic while on assignment.”

“Yes, I can see just how sorry you are.” Findlay turned to Sophie, and extended a hand. “What do you expect you’re here for?”

Sophie shook his hand, then glanced around the room uncomfortably. “Are you asking me, or Alex?”

“Both.” Findlay gestured to a pair of seats - one of which had clearly been altered with a narrower back to accommodate Sophie’s wings.

Alex took the seat next to hers, as Amanda was directed by her boss to sit across the table. “I assumed I’m here either to get praise for doing a job well done - in which case you’re welcome - or to be chewed out for fucking up - in which case, uh. Sorry. Again.”

Findlay said nothing but turned to Sophie, who leaned forward. “I suppose I’m here because you wanted to meet me. You probably have a thousand questions.”

“Maybe a few hundred or so, yes.” Findlay smiled at her as he retook his seat. “Though I would imagine you probably have a few of your own. Why don’t you go first?”

“You introduced yourself. Amanda introduced Mr Prest there. Perhaps a good place to start would be introducing the others present?”

“Oh, of course. How thoughtless of me!” Findlay stood up and walked over to the first seat closest to him. “This is Daniel Seth, the head of the Nexus branch of TF. Next to him,” Findlay gestured to the woman seated nearby. “Diane Fedintin, head of communications.”

“Another PR zombie?” Alex suddenly asked. “I thought we were past all that.”

“Public Relations is a department under me, yes.” Diane said cooly. “As is the coordination between Proxima, Sol, and most of our field teams - including your own.”

“Walter you said you know - he handles the actual go-to of our field teams. Once you’ve done your job and the markers are placed, he arranges for the mining ships to go out and cart back the contents of the fields you’ve found for us.” Findlay continued, pointing to the exec opposite of where Daniel was sitting, “Amanda’s here as your ship’s official TF representative. And lastly this is my brother, Tristen.”

“Pleasure to meet you, Tristen. What position do you have here?” Sophie said politely, in full-on diplomacy mode.

“Technically none. Though I am on the board of directors. Findlay and I co-own the majority of shares in the company; in fact, our family owns close to 70% of all shares period. As for why I’m here,” Findlay and Tristen both met each other’s gaze briefly, before he turned back to Sophie, “I guess it’s a bit of nepotism. Using my own power as a shareholder and my brother’s as CEO in order to swing a meeting with one of the first aliens to visit Humanity. Also I have been noted to be slightly more diplomatic than my brother, so there may be a rough spot or two I might be able to smooth over.”

“So that’s why YOU’RE here. Why are WE here?” Alex rocked back in the chair as he regarded the assembled group.

“That’s cutting straight to the point.” Findlay observed, then took his seat once more at the head of the table.

Sophie turned to give Alex a pointed stare, and Alex sighed as he rocked back forward and put his arms down on the desk. “Sorry, I’m not trying to be rude, just… a reflex. I’m sure Amanda’s pointed out but I’m very, very bad at subordination. I’m guessing I’m here because I’m about to owe you all my soul trying to recoup my losses from Sol, and that’s put me more than a little on edge.”

“Sol is, indeed, the reason why you’ve been called in here.” Findlay admitted. “That and Miss Teltsin’s request that we lend our aid in finding a solution for the dilemma that our visitor here has.”

“Does this mean you’ve found an option we can go with?” Amanda asked tentatively.

Findlay looked at her, then gestured towards Sophie. “There are options, yes.  As you yourself have noted some are better than others. The concern is that there are entirely too many unknowns that complicate matters. So before that, we should perhaps focus on the more immediate concerns.”

“Obviously as a contractor there are limits to the amount of support we can offer you.” Prest spoke up immediately after Findlay finished speaking. “Your contractor position allowed you to circumvent some of the bureaucratic regulations that have troubled us in the past, however given the changing nature of the political landscape - as well as the changing nature of our needs-”

“Yeah, I recognize a recruitment pitch when I hear it. I’m just gonna say no right now and save you the time. I’m not interested in joining up.” Alex cut the taller man off mid-sentence, and took a deep breath. “I appreciate the offer, I’m not interested.”

“Mister Sherman, the situation has changed. You of all people should recognize that fact.” Findlay spoke up again. “In the past, we have always supported you and your operations. Perhaps enough to be able to earn a modicum of trust in return?”

“It’s not trust, it’s…” Alex bit his tongue as he forced himself to stop before he went on a rant. “As a contractor, I had a level of freedom that I feel like I need. I could do what I wanted, go where I wanted, and I could take or leave jobs as I wanted. I didn’t have any deadlines, performance metrics, none of the usual corp shit to deal with. And I’m pretty damned hesitant to give that up.”

“We’re offering you a job, not trying to sell yourself into slavery. Plenty of people join and leave jobs all the time.” Diane suddenly cut in with annoyance. “Yeah, it means you’ll be taking more direction from us but we’re not going to be dictating your day to you.”

“You’d be alright with me making my own hours, doing the assignments I choose at my own leisure?” Alex regarded her with skepticism. “I mean, I know you guys are a lot less shitty than other corps but even you all wouldn’t hire an employee with those kinds of demands.”

Findlay steepled his fingers beneath his moustache, and stared at Alex intently. “And what if we accepted those conditions for your employment? What then?”

Alex started to respond with snark, but stopped himself as he regarded the older CEO’s face. “What is this really about?”

“Isn’t it about a job offer?” Findlay responded casually, and Alex stared at him before turning to face Amanda. She seemed just as nonplussed as he was.

I did a 7 month cut where I lost around 15 KG’s, I never starved myself and allowed myself to enjoy some junk & alcohol. Towards the end, I started using sweeteners and diet drinks to satisfy any cravings. 

I finished the cut at December and did some maintaining before beginning a bulk. Through December and now January, I’ve been binge eating nearly every other day.

My maintenance is 2200 calories, my bulk intake is 2500, and every other day I’m going up till 3500-4000 through binges.

I’m sleeping alright, eating hearty meals full of carbs, Protien and fat (example: rice, chicken and cooking cream - chicken fajita wraps etc)

I’ve been trying to find the culprit, first I assumed it’s winter making me hungry, but never in my life did it make me hungry this much. The only new thing that I’ve kept using is artificial sweeteners, so I wanted to ask, could that be a problem? I use around 6 tablets a day, 2 in coffee and 4 in tea. (Aspartame and Sucralose)

I’m not stupid.

Everyone knows the strangers are dangerous on the Outside. Everyone knows that. But before I’d actually gone Outside, before I’d started… Seeing them live under their own rules, not human ones, it didn’t really click. Hell. I’d seen neighbors disappear after unfits got in, or be hurt by them in plenty of more concrete ways.

But I’d also seen the unfits hurt their own kind. And inside the walls, someone would always take care of the monsters when they showed their fangs. And it wasn’t always humans doing it. The monsters wanted to live their lives in peace, too.

My father went away because, no matter how long he lived among ‘normal people’, there was always someone who’d look at him sideways. For every smile sent his way there was a hushed whisper behind his back. When my mother died, it only got worse. Last words he ever spoke to me, he asked me to come with him on a trip to the Outside. He kind of made it sound like a business trip.

I remember how, every day, he used that mug. Some dads collect those Father of the Year mementos and assign them a great deal of importance only until the relevant celebration passes, then quietly put them squarely into practicality instead of sentimentality, subconsciously or otherwise. My dad displayed and used them as religiously as if they were gifts from an angel.

I didn’t go with him, so I didn’t see what happened to him. Maybe he got all the way to the end, and he just didn’t want to come back. Maybe it’s wonderful at the far end of the road. But what I saw yesterday, that guy just. *Disappearing*. I don’t really have much confidence in that particular wishful thought anymore.

That’s not why I’m writing this now, though. Well. Not the only reason. I want to leave something behind if I don’t come home some day, and there’s other things I’m worried about. Other people. I couldn’t help but picture everyone I knew vanishing into thin air like that. The Moss Man, with his advice and his weird antics. Tommy, with his gushing and his careful eye. Lupe, even when she’s quiet or snappy.

I know there’s awful shit out there, but the people in *here*, living next door, sharing my work space, they aren’t. At least, not near bad enough for me to wish them away like that. Like they’d never existed.

I decided, the day after, I hadn’t paid enough attention to my coworkers. I watched the alert board, real carefully. I didn’t look at Lupe or Tommy while I talked to them at first. I just did the daily routine while I chatted away. I think my hand was shaking, since I eventually spilled a bit of hot coffee on myself and cursed.

“You okay?” Tommy asked. He’d been saying something about that television series he’d mentioned before. Improper Crimes. It was how I found out that, apparently, that ‘murder investigator’ from the other day was now co-starring in it.

“I… Yeah, yeah. I’m good, Tom.” I wiped it up when Lupe handed me a towel. Extra strength, for when she shifted and blood got places. “Just a bit… On edge.”

“Because of what happened?” Tommy was taking notes on something. I was noticing a couple small things now that he did. When something on the monitors went into a building, or started doing anything that seemed too personal, he immediately stopped taking notes. Sometimes, they looked up at him while he was watching. Others didn’t.

“What… What is he, Tom?”

“You mean the… Author.” Tom’s clipped, cheerful tone dropped away again. “He’s been around a while. I think there’s people out there who used to be normal. Who had jobs, just like us. The running theory is that, when everything changed, so did they. But they still do their jobs.”

“So he keeps writing.”

“So he keeps writing. And he still wants inspiration.” He paused. His pen went still. “He’s never been that bold before. I don’t know how he did what he did. He watches, usually. And writes.”

“And lets everyone else take the fall for him. So he can get intrusive.”

“Exactly. Or he worms his way into your private life the usual ways.”

“You think he knows something we don’t?”

“He has to. He’s not supposed to be able to just… Do that. Not without reaping what he sows. And he still has to actually write.”

“Is he human? Or…”

“I don’t know. Maybe he used to be. But maybe now he’s not. If he is, could be why he doesn’t use the paths. Could be…” Tommy trailed off. I saw his whole body starting to wind up. He resumed his pen scratching, but it was strained. Slow, careful, like he was afraid he’d write down the wrong thing and something bad would happen.

“Do you think he can be… You know. Stopped. Forcefully.”

Tommy looked at me, and so did Lupe. Lupe especially was digging into me with her gaze. “You’re not serious.” She said.

“I don’t know.”

“I think someone would’ve done it already if he could be. *They* should’ve been able to do it. I don’t know why they…” Tommy tapped his pen against his chin. Then started writing again.

“You aren’t meant to know everything about someone. You aren’t meant to be able to hold them in your hand.” Lupe watched the board at her desk. Started doodling something.

“In your… Hand.” I raised a brow at that, then let it sink in. “I wonder if he has… An assistant, maybe. Or something. I’ve seen, heard about, people doing some pretty crazy stuff out-”

“We aren’t meant to know everything. Just deal with it when it shows up.” Tommy piped up. He looked right at me, frowned, then turned back to the monitor. It started to click that I was freaking him out.

“Sorry.”

“It’s fine.”

Silence took the reins for a bit, then something popped into my head. “Wait. Okay, I know we were about to drop it, but I’ve gotta ask something. The… Book. What do you, like, do with them?”

“Burn them. Way too much sensitive information inside.” Tommy answered.

“Noted.”

I passed a few people through the gate after that. It was a lot harder, all of a sudden, to do the checks. To say the phrase. Nothing was certain anymore. I kept thinking that, maybe, the next person I’d let in wouldn’t be someone who was meant to go in. That, maybe, they’d go inside Society, find all my secrets, and put me together on a note board somewhere. Then I’d be gone. My next solo was coming up soon, too, and I was dreading it.

I went through the pamphlets I’d been given when I’d started. I’d paid attention, taken my notes. But a lot of it suddenly seemed a hell of a lot more menacing. Used to just be a list. Do’s and don'ts. Now it seemed more like a guidebook for potential horrific fates, just without the details about how exactly you’d be broken.

I found where the Author was mentioned. More or less described him as a serial killer, who tries to cook up elaborate scenarios he can tip the dominos on. There were others, too. Little categories. I wonder if they’d change if I went over to the next section of the wall, all the little classifications, the finer details. I guessed that these were the ones that were most likely to show up at my door, particularly, or that were everywhere.

I made a mental note on each. The friendlies, the unfits, the in-betweens. The general ones and the specifics. After I did my diligence, I asked my coworkers if they wanted to meet somewhere after work, gave a time, place, date. Tommy told me sure, but work stuff would be kept off the conversation table. Lupe just looked surprised. I almost thought she’d say no. But she hummed to herself after. I think I caught her smiling, though the smile was slightly awkward.

I left work that day feeling odd. I’d been slacking, sure. Almost paid the price for it last month. But when I went through the pamphlets, when I read those logs, too. Something felt off. I know very well I’m at the bottom of the food chain as far as authority goes. I’m a glorified desk clerk. I think the reason they took me in was because I’d worked basic security before. Reception, campus security.

There’s gaps in my knowledge that don’t make sense. My awareness. Did something from the Outside mess with my head, and I’m only now realizing? Am I a lucky dumbass, just too fresh out of water? I can’t quite remember some of the things that have passed through the gate anymore. There’s something about the past, the place I live, the job. All of it. Little blurry edges, like on the documents.

If I think particularly hard about it. If I focus. I remember that we have a science branch. And I realize that there’s a whole slice of this section of the wall, a select few people, that are nothing more than fuzzy static to me. Have you ever heard of white room syndrome? It feels like that.

**5/21/20xx**

It was solo shift today. I’ll be honest, that peace and quiet feeling has gone away. Used to be, for those first four months, I’d just sit here. Read. Glance up at the monitors, run my eyes over the board. Smile and tip my mug at people. I still try to do that. But it’s a lot, lot harder to relax.

Which isn’t great, me being so tense, since the entire reason these exist is so that the shy ones can come out. That, and so the Outside feels less like it's being watched. I think it gets antsy, somehow. Too many eyes on the back of your head, you might lash out eventually.

The get together went well. I learned that Lupe wants to be some kind of creative. But that she doesn’t know what kind. I learned that Tommy planned to go to some sort of. In-person meet thing that would pop up in town soon. With the runners of that one show. It was good to see both of them being warm. I’ll be honest, I don’t think I ever realized how distant I was with people. I’ve always had friends. Coworkers, at all my jobs, who I felt I knew well.

But I always had some kind of barrier. In the places I needed to have them the least.

I spoke to my neighbors, too. Part of it was paranoia. Making sure everyone seemed to be who I thought they were. I pried a bit. But in here, in Society, that doesn’t mean much. Not unless I take the wrong information Outside. Even then, strangers could forget, too. And not everything was interesting. But there are places they want to go, personal places, and they always love true names. I hear that, in other parts of Society, when they name you at birth they lock the sacred phrase away in some government info vault.

There’s a few things I want to test, now. But the consequences of testing them, I think, aren’t ones I want to try my luck with.

Something weird happened today. I passed around twelve or so people. Mostly quiet sorts, who struggled to do the checks with me but I gathered were more worried about what they’d see on my side than what I’d see coming from theirs. I remember one in particular, who said something that helped me settle down just enough to get through the rest of the queue.

“Over the wall. When someone… Goes away. You notice, yes?”

It was an odd question, I furrowed my brow a bit. Then I remembered. “We have… People whose entire job is just finding people.” They made a face, so I clarified. “And bringing them back.”

After the incident with that guy who tried to bash his head in right in front of me, I was pretty anxious. Tapping my fingers against the board, constantly flicking my eyes over all the controls. Wondering when I’d see something I couldn’t deal with on the monitor, sweating when the thought crossed my mind I was neglecting some part of my space: a camera unwatched, a light unnoticed, a shadow on the horizon.

I went through the check with what I thought would be the last one. I felt the world relax around me, almost, as I heard distant noises and saw a few people here and there on the monitors get ready to turn in for the night or switch shifts. Go home. The lights of distant Communities dimmed or got brighter, and the last drop-offs and pickups were made at the Posts.

I looked out across the field at the forest, at the dark trees, looking to see if there were any stragglers. I was seeing things half the day, hearing sounds that weren’t there, and I don’t think anyone was messing with me but myself. I was eager to go home, think over some things. Plan. But when the… The woman in the medical gown walked up to the treeline, stared at me without saying a thing, I was pretty sure it was real.

There was something off about her face. She was too tall. Some sort of aura lingered around her, reaching out towards me all the way from across the field despite its recent growth. It was somehow cold and sterile, but pungent and stale. Like someone had died and been left to rot, and the mortician called it good doing only half the embalming.

I had this thought. Wondered if it was a cousin, or sister, or whatever of that lady with the watch. I half expected her to explode into dust, then be washed away in the rain.

She hesitated, maybe. If I stared at her long enough, gauged her posture, she seemed like she was ready to run instead of pounce. Her chest rose and fell slowly, her hand dug claws into the nearest tree.

I look at the board. It’s around now that I notice there’s no lights or alerts popping up. The comms people on rotation don’t say a word. The guards don’t usually slack, not even this close to shift end, but when I look at the wallside-facing feeds I don’t see them react, really. When I look back out the window, I still see them. And I see the monitor that corresponds to the exact spot she’s standing in is now taken up fully by her face.

Her face is like if you took a person’s face, a dog’s, mashed them together then ran it over. Somehow, though, she was still pretty. I don’t know how to describe it. You ever see someone with scars, maybe some nasty ones, but it kind of just makes them feel. Refined? Strong? It reminded me of Lupe, weirdly. It kind of set me off, since it doesn’t exactly put me in the headspace for *relaxing* when someone feels pleasant and familiar, and you don’t know why. Especially not if they feel like someone you already trust.

She tried to speak. I saw her mouth move, and all I heard was the crackling of old vocal cords. I sat there, waited, tension growing in my back and limbs as she worked out her voice. “...Change.”

I didn’t respond. I debated if I should alert security. Tried to assess my surroundings.

“...Better. Now? Time… Long… Not… Not… Not often…”

I click the button that’s supposed to call security, not feeling like taking much risk. Worst case, they’d stand by to intervene while I figured this last incoming stranger out. The button didn’t do anything. I clicked it two more times to make sure. But it didn’t do anything.

The dog-faced woman standing in the trees starts to fade away back into the shadows, but her face doesn’t leave the monitor. When I look out at the window, I notice she must’ve taken a few tentative steps out into the field. Like testing the water before getting in. There was a little bit of dead grass, a couple wilted flowers, at the edge where the field meets the woods.

“...Pital. Hos. Hospital?” It sounds like she’s trying to ask me a question.

“I don’t… Do you need medical help?” My voice gets low and hushed. I look around me. It feels like there’s eyes on my back.

“...Yes. Yesss. Direct. Direct me.”

“...Okay.” I don’t know how she’s hearing me still, walking off like she is. I pull up one of the pamphlets. I’ve got a directional guide, partially for myself - you never know when you’re going to cross a road and skip a dozen or two more miles than you’re supposed to - partially for when I need to tell someone where to go. I’m not a communications officer or aide, but I’m a small voice in the chorus that they poke for a line sometimes.

“Angelvale. Okay, so…” And I give her directions. I notice the alerts that’re supposed to follow her don’t. After a few minutes, she seems to be finding her way alright. She looks up at me from the monitors.

“I walk. The rest. Alone.” She wasn’t emphasizing, but struggling to get the words out. Then she starts walking.

It didn’t click until my arm started hurting that she was trying to tell me to stop watching her. I don’t know if it was prying now, that I’d done a rule break. I wasn’t Outside, so it shouldn’t count anyway. But I follow her as she flickers across a few monitors.

Past the sleeve of my blue and yellow shirt - I’d returned to formal wear recently, I was hoping donning the colors the strangers like would make them less likely to screw with me - I noticed my wrist skin flaking away a bit. As I flicker my eyes between her and my hand, there’s a little bit of putrid black-green crawling out of the flaking spot. It doesn’t feel pleasant.

I stop looking. After a bit, the rot recedes like it’d never been, and I’m fine. I don’t call security and make a report. Instead, I picture myself withering away into dust and black bone, and the mental image of a whole team of black-and-green suits reduced to a putrid puddle in their own armor keeps my finger away from the pen and the board.

**5/23/20xx**

Mandatory team companionship encouragement rotation came up for us today. If someone is reading this - I don’t know, maybe you pried it out of my drawer at home after I vanished making a misstep - that’s just code for bullshit non-negotiable participation in corporate style bonding activities. At least they were paid. It was, so far, the most pleasant forced overtime I’d ever worked. Sometimes, they were just straight up done on-shift if enough people’s schedules aligned right.

Lupe and Tommy were there. So was Ron. Ron was wearing this crisp black suit, though I think he wears those things more for the absurdity of seeing his barely formal ass suited up. I actually saw a few of his mysterious aides there. Technically my security booth was supposed to have one. I wasn’t the only inspection-pass-go worker along this section of the wall. We were supposed to get a replacement aide soon for our checkpoint, since ours had just kind of gotten up and left one day my second month in.

I’d watched one of Ron’s aides for a bit. Was a woman who had little feathers around her eyes. I’d brought that group photo with me, the one that’s supposed to show my coworkers. I was still the only one in it, face and proportions all broken, and I tried to picture where she should be standing. I didn’t ask to see the original, though I had access. I was afraid I wouldn’t recognize most of the people in it, or not everyone would be in that one, either.

The people who were fuzzy in my head were around, at least a handful. Everyone present was someone who’s shifts aligned. Was a whole schedule for the mandatory co-activites. Not much happened. I mostly just chatted with the people I were familiar with, or who approached me. Tommy had explained a few of the odder people’s ‘stranger tics’ to me, and Lupe had actually been fairly interactive. 

She talked with almost everyone, and she’d asked me if humans still held balls anywhere in Society. I told her that in the Old E - for other parts of Society, we tend to just use nickname titles to be specific - they’ve been doing court stuff again for a while now. Not sure why, but she seemed to tense up at the idea, even though she sounded almost… Wistful, during that part of the conservation.

I didn’t say anything to Ron. I’d brought my #1 Border Watcher mug here, too. I sipped fruit juice from it, in his general direction, and I think I might’ve drank a bit by then and was possibly trying to make a statement. I watched the king in his court, tailed by his subjects. The party ended with me definitely having drank enough to help Tommy do a dramatic, impromptu investigation into someone’s missing personal items - we asked, of course, first if we could look - in which I eventually realizing he was calling me by a name that sounded a lot like a sidekick’s. He was wearing some kind of investigator type hat and everything. I think he had a fan shirt, too.

On shift, later - yeah, you still have to go to work after/before if your workload lines up too - I was feeling chummier than usual. More actually relaxed. It was more towards night, sun was setting. We passed a few early people, one of them apparently very eager to get through the gate before the sun went all the way down. Denied a handful. I think they can tell if you’re relaxing sometimes, the ones you don’t want in. Nothing insane happened, but it put me more towards back on edge by the last one.

Someone who’d passed had put a radio in the deposit. Like, an actual one, a bit on the older side. The sort you’d carry around. It was a bit perplexing, but the one who’d given it had passed, and there wasn’t anything weird about it. I tuned it a bit, curious, though I let Tommy watch me. I didn’t ask him about it, but I noticed it felt like he was looking at me with two eyes instead of the one good one sometimes, even though he visibly lacked the other. I think he can see things I can’t. Like Lupe. I don’t know if it’s an observer thing or what, though.

The radio picked up Society-side channels. I think a few Outside-side ones, too. I kept my finger on the off button at all times in case something I’m not supposed to hear comes up.

I finish messing with it, but it’s not done. Near the tail end of the shift, while I watch Lupe run through two pizza boxes and start on the last one - party leftovers - and wonder if she can get sick, I see that dog-faced woman again. I look at my two coworkers, and they look at me before following my eyes to her.

“You guys see that, right?” I ask. I don’t point. And I don’t look at the woman for long.

I notice both of them look away, though Tommy’s gaze lingers a lot shorter than Lupe’s. Lupe stares at her for maybe a full minute, just watches her. “She is not supposed to be out. Don’t look. Don’t touch. Not even through a barrier.” She looks over her desk buttons. Flexes her fake human fingers. I think she’s debating what to do.

“Angelvale. Nice.” The woman’s face is on the monitor again. I check the side cams. The guards still can’t see her. Ron is off right now. The aide doesn’t come till tomorrow. I check the pamphlets, but nothing relevant is in there.

“Angelvale…” Tommy’s watching the place the woman is standing, but not her. “...How is she doing that? She shouldn’t be… Where is…” He’s muttering to himself, like he’s putting together clues.

The radio crackles to life again. It plays a snippet from three songs. *Life on the Inside*, *God’s hand in the rain*, *All that the Eye can’t see*. The first one is a personal favorite of mine. I think I see Lupe tense up for a second, pause and go rigid. Tommy doesn’t react aside from looking at the radio.

“Don’t answer it. Only technical experts are supposed to on this side.” Tommy’s tone was to-the-point. He looked at Lupe. “Do you think you can handle-”

“No. She’ll outpace me. Call-”

“Congratulations! Tonight, you’re our lucky caller!” A crackled, staticky voice came out of the radio, like if you gave radio waves a particular kind of coherence. “Now, same rules as always. If you can’t answer a few questions correctly, we’ll give you a helping hand if you need one, a special prize if you don’t.”

I almost say something, but just purse my lips instead. I hear Lupe get up. Hear her footsteps trail away. She doesn’t go through the door, though, out into the field.

“Where’s she headed? Doesn’t she need to be-”

“We need someone particular for this. It’ll be fine, just ignore her.” Tommy flicks his eyes towards the woman with the dogface, briefly, to show me who he’s talking about before he watches the radio instead. I run through a pamphlet, find a designated entity under the Professionals section, called the Station. Not sure if you’ll be able to read some of this. Tommy gave me some of that… Blur-ink, and told me to censor if I was journaling, just in case.

“Question one: why do the wolves chase the giant?” The radio asked.

The woman outside answered. I looked at her, just a second, saw her dig claws into the tree. That little aura of decay grew a little bigger, cast a longer shadow. “When the wolves pass, they do not want to have the souls of their shepherd’s flock stolen.”

Tommy freezes up. He was taking a few notes. The tip of his pen was a different color now. I think I heard him click it. “That’s one down.” The radio continued. “Question two. Why does the lord’s child see what he is not meant to?” Tommy pauses again, then scratches a little faster. I think I see his brow sweat before he wipes it away.

The woman starts walking forward. Her face is off the monitor. As she gets closer, and the field withers around her feet, I don’t look at her. But I hear distant wheezing. It sounds like she’s in pain. “He traded with someone. So that he could look where he was not meant to.”

“Tommy? What do we-”

“You’re on a roll! Okay, question three: do you think he knows whose skin he’s really wearing?”

“He doesn’t. He doesn’t know where he belongs.” She’s crossed halfway to, now. I think I hear an engine roar to life, somewhere to my left. The guards at the gate, when I check the side feed, are gone.

“That’s all. We have a winner! Though, you up for a bonus round?”

“Always.” She crosses all the way over. I don’t know if she’s walking slow or fast, but she’s got a long stride. She puts her hand on the window. I can’t help it. I look up, look her right in the eye. I see her long, clawed fingers, made for tearing. Her strange face. Her mouth opens, and I see her coarse tongue and her misshapen teeth, half predator, half prey.

I make eye contact. I freeze, then the sting on my hand, the moment it starts, pulls my eyes back. I saw the glass starting to take on a strange color. Saw sand drip down the window in rivulets.

“Why do we live in a world, where we aren’t allowed to love?” The radio’s tone is different. Any trace of confidence is burned out and filled with flatness.

“I don’t. Know.” The woman’s voice croaks. “It. Hurts.”

The radio doesn’t ding or sound any bells, or pop any streamers. Someone’s voice comms over the comm, telling me and Tommy to vacate the premises. Something compels me, for a moment, to reach up and put my hand where the woman’s is. I don’t know if it’s me, or something else making me do it. I think, maybe, it’s a bit of both.

Tommy pulls me away when my fingers start to bleed from the nail. The last thing I hear is the radio as I force my legs to carry me out of the room. “They’re out there. They still love you. And they’re waiting.” It sounds defeated. And I don’t know who he’s talking to. I pass Lupe, who came to meet us, and I see her stop and listen to it for a moment before making a strangled noise.

**5/25/20xx - 5/26/20xx - A**

I’m writing this bit before shift. I’d been afraid something would happen that I wouldn’t want to if I kept writing things down. Tommy had told me that I may need to submit my journal to inspection if my stress levels end up hitting a ceiling. I’d told him I’d burned it.

And I had. But it came back. Someone had left a box of paper slips and clips in the deposit during my solo. I didn’t mention it until now since I didn’t think it meant anything. I’ve got one in my hand, right now. If I turn it over, I see a rabbit on the back sitting on the moon. It’s thick as an envelope, with a square of parchment on the inside.

I’m going to leave this for when I come back. I’ve got a hunch, and there’s something I want to test. If someone’s reading this, send me a sign.

Who are you? You’re not fit, are you? Or maybe, you’re a friend. Just one who doesn’t respect personal space.

1hybebm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hybebm/hey/,Hey,"I feel so stupid.  

Our connection runs so deep, the love we have for one another is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.  It’s a dumb line, I know, overused, glamorized in movies, overly quoted by teenagers with little life experience and yet I can’t find any other phrase that fits to my feelings.  

You complete me.   

How could I have I have thought that saying goodbye, no matter how many times I do, would lack any emotion?   I guess it was easier yesterday, sun reflecting off your beautiful face,  a light breeze in the air gently blowing your perfume my way.  Everything was perfect, and I was blinded by you.  It’s hard to think clearly when you’re under the influence.   Consequences aren’t fully realized until you sober up, and for me that hits hard today.   

The weather today, is in perfect harmony with me.  Dark, wet, and cold.  Matching on the exterior how I felt from the moment I woke up.   

I know you won’t read this.  I know you can’t.  I know it isn’t healthy, and won’t separate us in the ways we need to.  I know a lot in moments of clarity, but my heart has never changed.   I’m in your orbit, drawn to your gravity, and I can’t break free, even if I wanted to.  

I both long for and dread the next time I will see you in the world.   You will see me, and ignore me, and I will do the same.  We will be together and apart in the same place.   You will steal a glance when I’m not looking, and I will too.  

I stopped here at a Starbucks, in the west part of our city to get some coffee.  One that we have been to together many times.   One that I’ve had beautiful memories of us at.   I’ve avoided it for a while,  not wanting to stir up these emotions I knew would follow.   Not wanting to face the truth of the situation.  

I know I’m not ready, I know I’m not strong enough to  concede to reality.  The pain is supposed to make you stronger, but it feels like it only makes me more calloused.  

You get me in a way I hadn’t thought possible.  You know me better than anyone ever has.  You are the reason for my successes, and the absence of you in my life takes a toll obvious to everyone around me. 

I’ll miss everything about you.  I’ll cry over you when nobody’s watching.  I’ll be around you but not with you.  I’ll be there waiting to do anything you’d ask me to.  I’m hopelessly in love with my soulmate.  

I don’t believe our story is at the end.   I think we just finished a chapter.   

I love you, I did yesterday, and I will tomorrow.  

I won’t say goodbye, I can’t write it, and I wouldn’t be an honest thing to write.

1hybc6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1hybc6t/job_doesnt_give_legal_breaks_trainer_uses/,"Job doesn't give legal breaks, & trainer uses constant profanity.","I recently got a job through a temporary agency. The company is shady, and has been not following the rules of the temp agency, which is in the contract between the employer and the temp agency. The temp agency has the same rules for all of their contracts.

I'm working at small private doctors office, and they do not give me legal breaks. They say feel free to go get a cup of coffee in the break room, walk around and go to the bathroom. My state requires 10 minute breaks of uninterrupted time away from the work area. What I consider a real break, is going out to my car for 10 minutes and coming back in. But this doctor's office doesn't operate that way. I don't see anyone going to take their breaks. 


Also the person training me says the F word a lot! I understand human nature and maybe it slipping every once in awhile in the work places. But they deliberately say the F word multiple times a day every day, and it's not in a joking way or a casual way, it's in a intense and angry way. My trainer is a negative person. As someone who is new on the job this is extremely unpleasant and uncomfortable for me. I'm a pretty positive person in the workplace, and I do not thrive around people who are extremely negative all the time. It makes it hard cause this is the person I'm learning the job from.

Another thing is they are trying to get me to stay past my scheduled time without paying me it seems like. My time card is through the temp agency. This is the first time this employer has used this temp agency and I think they think they can do whatever the heck they want, as if I'm already their employee. A few days ago we were getting really close to 5pm, and it was like 4:57pm and they were still trying to give me projects. So I reminded them I'm set up with the temp agency to leave at 5pm, unless you are wanting me to stay and get overtime. They said they did not want to pay the temp agency more money for me to stay, and I probably wouldn't see how expensive it is on my end, but that would on their end. So that's kind of cheap in my opinion to say that. 

Also on Fridays I get off at 12pm. Last Friday 12pm rolls around, and I close my workstation, grab my purse, and I said okay I'll see you guys Monday. And the manager acted like I was leaving early, and she basically said ""leaving so soon?"" I was shocked she said this to me and it was only my second day. And I said ""Well I have to do what the temp agency wants me to do."" I didn't say much because I was in shock. 


Then I was talking to the manager a couple days ago, and she tried to say I left early on Friday. And I did not, I left at the scheduled end time. I was about to say something, and she interrupted me to talk about something else. 

Also when I first had my interview with this company (the temp agency set up) they asked me if I saw thier job add anywhere, outside of the temp agency. And I said no. So it's kind of like they are trying to pull the wool over my eyes and the temp company's eyes and steal me from the temp company. How it works is you are in a contract for 3 months and if the employer likes you then they hire you and basically buy you out from the temp agency. If I or the employer set up me getting hired outside of the temp company we could get sued, because we both signed paperwork which is part of this agreement.

Another red flag is in my interview the manager asked me ""How long can I expect you to stay before you look for something else?"" And this is a temp job, so I thought it that is a strange question. 

Also the clinic is open 9 hours per day, they say they pay for a 30 minutes lunch and the other 30 minutes of the hour is unpaid. But it doesn't make sense. Because if I only take a 30 minutes lunch, then technically I am working for 8.5 hours, and those other first 30 minutes that I come back to the desk after lunch are technically unpaid. And the they have their employees staying after the shift, and don't report it on their time cards, and they justify it with the ""paid lunch"". So they have to put what time they were supposed to end on their time card, and not put if they went over. Like say that were supposed to end at 5pm, and they stayes until 5:40pm, th t would only put down until 5pm.

Not only are these lies (I'm Canadian so my math is in CND) as the total you're saving annually is not going to amount to a down payment in any realistic time frame, but it is part of a long standing idea that the middle and upper class have that the only ""good"" poor people are the ones who are living a life of deprivation and suffering. 

So, the math (which is the egregious part).   
Average home price in Canada is about $700k, and you need minimum 5% as a first time buyer, so the number we are aiming for on this one is $35k.   
Average student loan debt upon graduation in Canada is about $30k (this is the trade off for those high housing costs I suppose?). So either way, we are looking to knock out about $30 to $35k with just subscriptions and a single daily coffee. 

To be generous, subscriptions are going to be the base, and the coffee is going to be from Tim Horton's (again, Canadian, but also their prices are in between Starbucks and McD's so, a median price). The person in this experiment gets 1 Large coffee every morning and 1 Venti Starbucks drink on Friday. 

Price of a Large Coffee from Tim's = $1.83 ($2.05 after taxes if paying cash).   
Price of Venti 'bucks = $6.65 ($7.50 after taxes if paying cash).

So we have just shy of $15/week here, 52 weeks in a year puts us at $780. 

Let's say they prepaid for a year of Disney plus, so $129.99 plus taxes, comes to 146.88 for a year, and Spotify is $99 if you prepay for the year, so $111.87. 

So we have a grand total of $1,038.75 saved a year. It would take over three decades to use THAT to save up, or pay off, $30k of debt. 

Now, this isn't to bitch about cutting costs for acute issues; absolutely that works. The issue is that ""cutting out fun"" isn't going to fix the systemic issue of ""not making enough money"" to afford life. ",12,1736534033.0,PetPeeves,3,1.0,False

Plaque?,"1: How do you discern whether yellow teeth is plaque buildup, erosion, staining, or something else? How do you identify the cause, exactly? Are there any specific tests or is it just observation?

Over the years, my teeth have become very yellow (and have some white stains). Yes, I know teeth are not supposed to naturally be pure pearly white, but... My teeth/jaw are already so crooked and fucked up, being so yellow as well is really destroying me. 

But besides aesthetics, I'm also worried about complications in the future like decay, breaking, pain, and whatnot.

Cameras don't capture the exact color correctly, but [here's some photos](https://ibb.co/album/LQPFRb).

Other factors: I had pretty bad oral hygiene up until my mid-teens (ironically I think the yellowing wasn't as bad back then).
I also have pretty bad xerostomia. 
My family on my mother's side often struggles with teeth breaking/falling especially during pregnancy.

Never smoked ever. I used to drink coffee, nowadays not anymore, but I always made a habit of rinsing then brushing after drinking it. 
I don't use whitening products (sometimes I've gargled hydrogen peroxide though). 2yrs ago I only tried a whitening brush gel and my gums started bleeding.


2: Is there anything that can help in this case? Sorry if it sounds silly, but is there something like ""shiny polish"" like there is for nails? 

I have a feeling that whitening is not suitable because I already have teeth sensitivity (mostly with acidic fruits or very cold stuff)...

Transcription:

Dear Mother,
We had a week of cool weather but it feels like summer is back with us again. The temperature is about 83 now. I hope it stays
out of the 90s till next summer but I know it won't. 

Joe had him another bicycle accident last week. He was making a gettaway from a dog that was chasing him and ran into the back of a parked pick-up truck. He had a pretty bad laceration on the stem end of his bladder so I took him to the emergency room at the local hospital and the doctor came and put three stiches on it.

I cleaned the rabbit pens Saturday morning.
I got two GI cans of manure that I gave to Lawrence Knippa. He wanted it for his roses and garden. I loaned him two dressed rabbits too. He will pay me back with deer meat.
I killed 13 rabbits all together and put 11 of them in my freezer.  I scrubbed the pens and sprayed them with Listerine. Underneath I sprinkled them with Sevin dust to thin out the pill bugs. I saw the giant lizzard. I think it  has some young ones now. The kids are still afraid of it. They used to think that it spat blood but now they think maybe it is fire instead of blood.

I used Duck's rotor tiller and got my little garden plowed up. This week I will put the beet and carrot seeds in the ground. Alice Mallad has some tomato plants for me but I watched football on TV instead of going after the plants. I went to get them Saturday when I took the rotor tiller back but she acted like she didn't want me around that day so I came home without them. They were expecting company and she was probably afraid I would make a mess.

We have started eating on our beef and it is a lot better than I had anticipated. It is tender and tasty. I think that idea about having to pen them up and feed them grain for a spell is an ""old wives tale"". 

Now I have to think about getting Norma something for her birthday. Ethel has already got a doll for her but I kind of like to pick out something too. Maybe I'll get her an A&I cap or a new Javelina tee shirt.

It's time for me to make a pot of coffee for the office girls and then apply myself to my job.

Love,

1hyawki,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hyawki/dialing_in_fresh_coffee_beans_breville_barista/,Dialing in Fresh Coffee Beans [Breville Barista Express Impress],"I decided to surprise my girlfriend with a Breville Barista Express Impress for Christmas after she had been draining money on nespresso pods for years. I went into the purchase with virtually no knowledge on espresso as I had not been drinking coffee consistently for 3 years or so. I decided to do a little research prior to Christmas day so that we could get it working the same morning. I quickly realized that this would scratch an itch in my little ADD brain and have been hyper-fixated on the process ever since. I immediately purchased a coffee subscription, as one does, and bought a bunch of accessories. I was able to dial in two grocery store beans of Buddy Brew Cubano espresso (roasted 12/11) and BKG Echoes (no roast date) within the first two weeks but most of my pulls were on the sour side.

My struggle really started when the first bag of fresh beans arrived. The bean is Atomic Coffee Roasters Space Cadet with roast date of 12/31. I have basically run through the entire bag with almost every shot pulling way too sour. My setup/workflow is as outlined below. If you have any advice that may help prevent wasting an entire bag on bad shots it would be much appreciated:

Setup:  
Machine/Grinder: BBEI  
Temp: Default  
Portafilter: LILQ Bottomless  
Basket: Breville Single wall double shot basket  
Inner Burr: 5  
Collar: Breville Dosing Funnel  
WDT: Normcore  
Tamp: Normcore spring loaded Tamper

Workflow:  
\- preheat machine for 10-15mins with Portafilter in group head  
\- Weight out 18 grams of beans  
\- Grind into dosing funnel and weigh for 18 grams again  
\- WDT with dosing funnel and tap down  
\- Tamp once with Normcore tamper  
\- flush group head  
\- tare scale and start timer and extraction simultaneously

Dial in attempts:

1. Grind size 9 @ 30seconds (target 1:2 ratio) - extracted too quickly, messy sputtery extraction -  45g at 30 secondsish - result: Sour
2. Grind size 7 @ 32 seconds (target 1:2 Ratio) - Extracted cleaner -  37g at 32 seconds - result: Better but still unpleasant and sour
3. Grind size 6 @ 30 seconds (target 1:2 ratio) - Nice extraction - 36 at 30 seconds - result: Awful pucker sour
4. Grind size 8 @ 1:3 Ratio - Decent extraction - 52 G at 38 seconds or so? - result: balanced then sour aftertaste
5. Grind size 7 @ 1:3.33 (60g yield) - Clean extraction - 60G at 40 seconds - result: Best tasting and most balanced shot. Perhaps a little diluted \*\*All attempts yielded a lot of crema

Is the moral of the story here that freshly roasted coffee will require longer ratios? If so, is the best approach to find the right grind size that gets me closets to the standard benchmark of 1:2 Ratio @ 30s first and then start extending the ratio to find where the taste balances out? My concern is that this approach will require \~3 attempts to find the right grind size then another 3 to find the right ratio which is roughly 30% of a 12oz bag. Alternatively, should I just avoid pulling shots on a bag of beans roasted within the last 2 weeks? Any tips are welcome.",1,1736532998.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Cao Van Vien sipped on a cup of coffee as read Proust. It was perhaps an odd sight to find the most senior military official of South Vietnam with his nice buried in French literary classics, but with his authority heavily sidelined by President Thieu the former Airborne commander was left with far too little to do despite his eagerness for combat and had to find something else to occupy his mind, which was increasingly being taken up with either yoga or French literature. His musings however were interrupted by the ringing of his desk phone.

Vien: Yes? General Cao Van Vien speaking

PA: Sorry to interrupt General, but I have the Prime Minister here sir, he says he wishes to speak with you personally

Vien: Very well, let him in

Vien sat upright in his chair, throwing his copy of *À la recherche du temps perdu* into a drawer as the door opened to let Trần Thiện Khiêm in then closed behind him. Vien made to get up but was interrupted 

Khiêm: Please, do not get up on my part. I'm very sorry to come unannounced

Vien: No problem at all Prime Minister, what can I do for you?

Khiêm: I had just finished a meeting with some members of cabinet and wanted to discuss the latest developments with the Chief of the Joint General Staff

Vien: As I informed the President and the Cabinet earlier, the RNVMF are fighting as planned on all fronts and the situation appears to be stabilising, there has been no major development since, though of course that is subject to change

Khiêm: I see, General. I will not waste too much of your time. We both know your authority over the actual forces is far less than your current position entails doesn't it?

Vien: I'm not sure what you are trying to imply, Prime Minister Khiêm...

Khiêm: President Thieu is interfering in command arrangements again, isn't he? Issuing orders directly over the head of JGS, involving himself in appointments and promotions

Vien: I do not like where this is going Khiêm, and you know that

Khiêm: I do, and I know you are a consummate professional, and a neutral one at that. But I also know you want to actually command troops again, to have authority over the Corps Commanders more than just being able to move around some reserves and issue guidelines that get ignored. I'm going to be requesting the President to conduct a reorganisation of some arrangements soon, as a reaction to this emergency. Among them will be giving JGS full authority over Corps Commanders. Will I have your support? Think over it, I'll be talking about it with Thieu soon. I hope I will see you there""

Vien did give a verbal reply, but Khiêm could see it in his eyes that the despondent general had finally found something to be enthused about.

*The same day*

Nguyễn Bá Cẩn lit up a cigarette as he sat in his private office, considering the offer that was being made by the man opposite him. The forty-two year old Speaker of the National Assembly was well used to the political machinations that characterized Saigon. He knew what a good deal looked like, but also what a dangerous dangerous gamble this scheme was. For his part, Khiêm betrayed no emotion except that continued state of slight bemusement he always appeared to be in, like he was in control of every situation. 

""The Party might not like it, but the Assembly possibly could"" he said after taking a good draw. ""It would however be much easier if we get the big man to endorse this then I can fairly easily get the votes. Get the Senate onside and I think we'll have enough. But the party might fall to pieces over this"" he warned his colleague. ""Leave the Senate to me, and I think we can swing the Party around on the grounds of necessity. Besides, it's about time they thought beyond just Thieu...""

The President grimaced as he tried to put on a brave face and sat down at the head of the table.

""Let's keep this brief, I'm sure none of us really want to be here for very long"" Thiệu tried to hold back the venom as he looked at the faces of his long-time rivals. ""So, tell me, why shouldn't have have the whole lot of you fired for this?"" he asked of his own administration members ""No need to answer it, I know when I have lost. But I want some terms of my own. I'll entertain this charade, this national unity government concept, but no more than six months? Is that clear? And I want you to deliver this administration the results, and the powers, it needs to brave this. At the end of this period, well, we will see where we are by then"" he said, glaring evidently at Khiêm.

""What kind of powers are you thinking?"" asked Cẩn ""I intend to declare a state of emergency, I want unfettered authority for the executive, now I'm sure I will now have to share it under the terms of this...arrangement, but I want the Assembly off my back. Can you get me the votes?"" he asked of Cẩn and Đôn. The latter replied ""It will not be easy but, I think with General Minh's status, we might be able to persuade the Senate"" Thiệu nodded.

""Very well, so I guess this is it then. I will not say I like this idea, nor I approve of it, but for the sake of our country I will do it. But gentlemen, this is not something I will be forgetting anytime soon"" he warned ominously. They all knew he meant it.

**Thiệu forms National Unity Front, embraces bitter rivals**

*Saigon Times*

In a stunning political development that could only have been a result of the dire national situation, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu announced today the formation of what he called the National Unity Front, bringing into the administration his long-time and bitter rivals former Vice President Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and former President Dương Văn Minh. The three men were seen addressing a press conference at the Independence Palace where they proclaimed they were placing their differences aside to mobilise their abilities and resources for the common good in the nation's hour of need.

Both men had previously ran against him for President before withdrawing following sudden changes to the electoral laws, bitterly proclaiming them to be rigged to his benefit. It is understood that both men are to join the cabinet, with Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm already submitting a new cabinet which was approved by the President today. The new administration includes a number of familair names and is balanced between the competing interests. It is uncertain at this hour what had occurred for such a move to have been made, but it is clear that this expedient measure is only due to the ongoing state of crisis brought about by communist aggression. Whether this will last long-term remains to be seen, and the history of conflict between its members does not presage well. For the sake of South Vietnam however the Saigon Times hopes that this show of unity will be more than just for show.

Now I have. [Varia vs3] grinder and I'm trying different settings. 3 didnt even pull, barely a drop and l used the puck screens. 4 was okay with out the screen but 4 with not a drop came out. And 4.5 worked a little better with out the screen.
I don't want to break my machine but I also want to use my puck screens to help keep my machine clean. Please help!
Oh and I also am using the portafilter that came with the machine.",1,1736532916.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

1hyauei,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delonghidedica/comments/1hyauei/help_with_result_of_deloghi_dedica_ec685/,Help with result of Deloghi Dedica EC685,"I’m new to espresso (Moka pot fan) and need some advice! I like lungo or long black coffee, or maybe something even more diluted. I'm using the 2-cup button.

**The equipment:**

* Delonghi Dedica EC685
* Timemore C2 grinder
* Normcore portafilter (capacity 16 to 18g)

***Some tests:***  
***1st failed tests:***

* *10g grain coffee, 8 click grinder, really finer (time more)*
* *Normcore portafilter*
* *Good tamped (the plastic taper that it come with the delonghi)*

***Result*** *>* ***Clog***

***2nd failed tests:***

* *10g grain coffee getting by Gaggia Md15 , finer option on this machine (bring to me grinded)*
* *Normcore portafilter*
* *Good tamped (the plastic taper that it come with the delonghi)*

***Result*** *>* ***Clog***

***3th tests (ok):***

* *16g grain coffee, 10 click grinder (timemore c2)*
* *Normcore portafilter*
* *Distributed, good tamped (the plastic taper that it come with the delonghi)*

***Result > Decent coffee***

**My issues:**

I haven’t found good results yet. The machine often spurts from the sides, the taste isn’t great, or it clogs.

**My question:**

**Would upgrading to a better grinder be worth it for the Delonghi Dedica?**

(e.g., Fellow Opus or DF64).

Some advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

**PS1:** The 10g tests were just to avoid overloading the basket (and maybe not clog).  
**PS2:** My budget is limited—a $200 machine in the USA costs double in my country  
PS3: I know forums always mention : ""Grind finer...""",1,1736532846.0,Delonghidedica,5,1.0,False

It didn't seem particularly expensive, so just wondering what the explanation is?  I didn't notice if alcohol had the alarms on the bottle tops or not.   Is there some kind of coffee theft ring?  Health concern?  or just high theft item for some reason among perhaps gamers trying to stay up all weekend?",1,1736532753.0,Thailand,0,1.0,False

1hyasqo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hyasqo,Beginner brew help. ,"I've just started brewing GongFu tea and I got a tea sampler from Jesse's tea house. 
Link: https://jessesteahouse.com/

I am using a rotating teapot from amazon but it's designed the same as the one on his site. See screenshots. 

I've brewed the two teas in the screenshot and both brews were super bitter with no other tasting notes. I did the wash at 210F and then dropped the temperature for the next steep. I stopped at 174F. Every steep was super butter and it never changed. For each brew I did around 6 or 7 steeps before quitting the brew. 

I started the brew times at the times listed in the instructions and then dropped them until I was pouring the water into the teapot and then immediately pouring the tea into the cups. Throughout the whole time the brews never lost any bitterness or changed flavor. 

I'm thinking my kettle might cause the issue since it has a slow pour. It probably takes around 5 to 10 seconds to fill the teapot with around 120ml of water. 

Is the bitterness something I'm doing or is it the teas? 

For reference, I can drink black coffee just fine and I don't notice the bitterness as much or not at all. So I am fine with some bitterness. ",7,1736532734.0,GongFuTea,12,1.0,False
