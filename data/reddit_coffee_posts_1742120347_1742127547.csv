Need validation.,"I had a secured IDFC Wow and a Kotak League Rupay. I had got these for Lounge and UPI respectively and it was convenient since I had good family level relationships with both banks. Having used these for 2 years and frequenting this sub I realised I wasn't really earning anything in the name of rewards or cashbacks so I decided to close the secured card (regretting now as it was LTF and Visa Infinite: 1+1 on BMS) and get 2 new cards: SBI Cashback Mastercard and Tata Neu Infinity Rupay.  
I got the SBI one easily with a 90k+ limit but HDFC only gave me a secured Tata Neu plus. Having had both the cards for a couple of weeks I have learned a few things:   
1. Tata Neu app is bs - like the worst shopping or finance app I have ever used. Paytm was a thousand times better at both.  
2. The Neucoin cashback system is too variable and complex. I have yet to understand how can I get the promised 7%.  
3. Even if I do get the 7% back in neucoins, it means I will have to use them instead of the card the next time which I think technically results to an effective return of 3.5% which is less than what SBI offers. (I have also been using my father's Amazon Pay card with prime and at least I can use the cashback in places I won't actually get the 5% CB, so I am using APay wallet when only losing out on the 1% CB transactions.)  
 4. Having a co-branded HDFC card is not a good idea if I'm hoping to get a core card anytime soon. (Based on the discussions on this sub).

Since most my transactions are online, I am pretty content with a straight up 5% from SBI. When I do use UPI it's mostly for chai coffee (lot of txns < INR 100) and it is my understanding that Tata Neu CB doesn't apply to them.

For some reason I could not get the Kiwi card so I am going to keep this card for UPI transactions for a while, but I have decided to close it before the end of the year. Until then I am hoping to find a replacement for a good cashback card for UPI. 

In the near future I am also hoping to get a separate fuel card (fuel spending \~40-45k p.a.) and enter the Amex world. Would value your inputs.",1,1742127124.0,CreditCardsIndia,0,1.0,False

# Leif writes home about his Experiences in New Guinea

Leif Gigstad, son of Mr. and Mrs. Goodman Gigstad, R. 5, Sturgeon Bay, is a mission teacher in New Guinea. Following are excerpts from his letters since Christmas up until March 2.

\* \* \* \* \*

Christmas in New Guinea sure was different but in many ways good, in that it helps you to appreciate things back home. Can you believe that I never heard Santa Claus mentioned once or the number of shopping days left until Christmas? A couple of the stores had a sign up advertising Christmas, but otherwise nothing is done in the line of decorating.

We do have some evergreen trees here that people put up in their houses, and decorate with lights and trimmings, but 90 degree temperatures and 90 per cent humidity most of the time just squelched the whole idea for me.

To the New Guineans Christ­mas is a time for having a big feast and a sing-sing (dance). The Christians have church on Christmas Eve and Christmas day but no gift exchange, etc. like we have.

New Year’s is nothing special here either. I was saddened to find that many New Guineans have learned from the Europeans that the only way to bring in the New Year is to be stoned (drunk).

I spent Christmas with the Rev. Paul Jordahls along with some 40 or 50 other people, mostly teachers, and we had a very nice time. Activities included church, 10 year old movies, swimming in the mighty Pacific, reading, eat­ing and best of all, socializing. We all find great enjoyment in sharing experiences from home.

One of the big changes coming is that the Australian government is planning to take over all the schools and then the question comes up, what happens to the schools run by missionaries? This country is working toward independence and the mission is working toward the day when everything will be turned over to the New Guineans. Some think they will be ready in a couple years while others think it will be a hundred years yet.

School starts again Feb. 3. . .I feel quite unprepared to teach tropical agriculture but think it will be interesting to learn. The crops down here are coconuts, coffee, bananas, rice and a few vegetable crops.

The humidity of this place is really demoralizing. All those expensive books sent from the States have begun to curl up, my shoes lay on the floor half white with mold, envelopes have all sealed shut and most metal things are beginning to rust. It is hard to get used to those big blotches of mold on the walls, but it does give the housewives something to complain about.

I have been assigned to teach 20 periods of agriculture and 10 periods of science a week, but it’s those outside duties which wear you out. One of my duties is the dining room. . .also have to preach sermons. . .then there is the garden work and the steady job of checking up on everything that is done. Although we usually swim in the Pacific ocean, today we went to this river a short distance from school. It was rather interesting as it was a typical tropical paradise as you see on TV at home. There are vines to swing on, hanging from the trees along the river, so you can really get a ride (if the vine doesn’t break).

A word heard often over here is Maski (pronounced muskie) which means “never mind, or forget it.”

Maybe a word about the school plantation since I spend much of my time out there. It is 450 acres and the crops are coconuts, bananas and coffee. The land was purchased as an experimental plot and partly to provide food for the students. So far this has been very undesirable since the students have stolen all the food which was supposed to be brought to the mess hall to be served. Now a beetle has come into the coconuts and destroyed about half of the trees and it looks as if the rest will have to go, too.

A big day in the church for New Guinea. The New Testament has been translated into Pidgin English and that is being dedicated. New Guineans are running New Guinea it and they are great ones to give speeches and say the same things over about 20 times. Another crisis is getting started with the service. No one has a clock so they come when they think it is the right time.

We had a two hour communion service this morning which is quite a challenge for the bottom end sitting on those hard benches. Among the things that took so long is that the sermon was preached twice, once in Nabag the local language, and then after that the same sermon in Pidgin English.

I was annoyed by all the noise and confusion going on during the service. It is custom in New Guinea not to discipline the chil­dren and often I couldn’t hear the preacher even if I could have understood him.

We should have about five acres of rice ready to plant this week. We had about five acres ready to harvest when the students came back in February but the insects got that. We worked this past week on getting what we call practical agriculture gardens ready for the students.

In agriculture I require every boy to have a garden where we experiment with new planting methods, new crops, fertilizer, insect control, etc. You can’t believe how hard it is to get these kids to change any of the things they are used to. They have done things the same way for hundreds of years and see no reason to change now.

One of the biggest problems here in gardening is the heavy rainfall. Many plants just can’t stand all the water, so I am hoping to get the boys to plant almost everything on ridges. Some of the things we are going to ex­periment with are carrots, beans, peas, cucumbers, corn, pumpkin, cabbage, etc.

In the fifth year after Earth's destruction, he awakened from his slumber—

Not as a hero, not as an emperor, not as a savior, nor even as the leader of human civilization.

He was simply himself, a traveler beneath the stars, seeking the meaning of his existence across infinite worlds.

Ark—a sanctuary hidden deep within his soul, carrying the last embers of human civilization.

This place was more than just a refuge; it was the last hope of ten thousand survivors.

They stood at the crossroads of history, with the familiar 21st century behind them and the boundless multiverse ahead.

Now, they are about to embark on their own journey, searching for the rebirth of civilization.

Yet, this is not a desperate struggle for survival, nor a path to supreme power.

It is a voyage across the multiverse—an odyssey of exploration, creation, and the pursuit of dreams.

A fantastical realm where swords and sorcery intertwine, a cultivation world where immortal paths and chivalry coexist.

A cyberpunk metropolis ablaze with neon, a post-apocalyptic wasteland where order has crumbled;

Setting sail from the era of solar system colonization, leading to the glorious age of galactic conquest…

Each world has its own story, waiting to be discovered.

They set forth, not for conquest or plunder, but to live up to the greatness of this era.

Now, the journey is about to begin—

Come, witness the birth of this legend with me!

# Chapter-007: Your Majesty

The bedroom door slowly opened, and the Prime Minister stepped out.

A faint trace of unhidden fatigue lingered on his face as his eyes quickly scanned the six cabinet members standing outside the door.

The six cabinet members immediately fixed their gazes on the Prime Minister, each silently asking with their eyes: How did it go?

The Prime Minister gave a slight nod, forcing a faint smile that conveyed the message, “It went relatively well.”

However, the weariness on his face was unmistakable, causing the cabinet members’ hearts to sink slightly. Things might be more complicated than expected.

Elo, his expression calm, emerged from the bedroom.

His mother approached, her tone filled with concern: “How did it go?”

Elo nodded at her. “Not too bad.”

Vian stood nearby, hesitating for a moment but ultimately saying nothing.

Elo said to his mother, ""Find a place. I need to hold a meeting with them to get a detailed understanding of the current situation.""

His mother smiled. “The venue is already prepared, right in the first-floor living room.”

Elo nodded and followed her down the stairs, with Vian close behind.

On the way, Vian lowered her voice and asked, ""How was the talk?""

Elo replied with a hint of helplessness, “I’ve said all that needed to be said. For now, we’ll maintain the status quo.”

Vian gave a slight nod and asked no further questions.

This brief exchange reached the ears of the cabinet members trailing behind, and they couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of relief.

Though the situation was complex, the reactions from both the Prime Minister and Elo suggested that things were moving in a positive direction.

Elo descended the stairs slowly, his gaze pausing at the bottom as the layout of the first floor came into view.

The living room was centrally located, connected to the dining area and open kitchen. Though compact, the space exuded warmth and order.

Against one wall of the living room were neatly arranged bookshelves, their books and decorations complementing each other, creating a cozy yet elegant atmosphere.

Four sofas encircled a small coffee table, on which ten teacups were meticulously arranged.

A middle-aged man stood at the edge of the living room. Upon seeing Elo, he immediately lowered his head, appearing reserved.

In the corner, two guards stood silently. Their eyes were not directly fixed on Elo, yet their inadvertent glances from the corners of their eyes were keenly noticed by him.

While the guards’ glances made Elo uncomfortable, he said nothing.

His eyes scanned the living room, and it was clear that the space had been temporarily converted into a meeting venue.

The arrangement of the venue, both in its details and overall layout, demonstrates a high level of respect for the occasion and meticulous attention to etiquette.  
Elo found the arrangement satisfactory and couldn’t help but nod in approval.

Elo then walked to the central seat and calmly said to the Prime Minister, ""Please, take a seat.""

The Prime Minister responded respectfully but did not move immediately.

He stood still, waiting for Elo and his family to be seated first. Only then did he walk to the single-seat sofa opposite Elo and sit upright.

Elo sat on the long sofa with his mother and Vian, taking the center position while his mother and Vian sat on either side.

Next, the six cabinet members took their seats on the long sofas to the left and right, three on each side, forming a symmetrical and orderly arrangement.

Their posture was upright and steady—neither overly reserved nor too casual—conveying a composed elegance that expressed genuine respect for Elo.

The Prime Minister seemed prepared to speak, but Elo interrupted before he could begin.

""Let’s not waste time with formalities. Get straight to the point.""

Elo’s tone was calm, but to everyone except his mother and Vian, these words carried an undeniable sense of authority.

The Prime Minister gave a slight nod, and the other cabinet members showed no surprise at Elo’s directness.

Clearly, everyone present had anticipated this response and was prepared for it.

At the edge of the meeting room, a middle-aged man sat quietly in a single chair.

In his hand, he held a sleek writing pad with some neatly arranged paper clipped to it.

The tip of his pen moved swiftly across the pages, recording every significant statement with clarity and precision.

Meanwhile, his portable recording device was already running, unobtrusively yet efficiently capturing every detail.

The Prime Minister looked at Elo and spoke with a hint of caution:

""First, I would like to report on a few key departments related to the Royal family...""

Before he could finish speaking, the Prime Minister stopped himself.

Elo had furrowed his brows, his expression showing clear dissatisfaction.

The Prime Minister and the cabinet members remained calm. It was obvious that they had already grasped the root of the issue.

Vian sighed softly, breaking the silence:

""You don’t want others to call you an emperor. We all understand that.

But in terms of both status and power, you are an emperor.""

Her tone carried a hint of helplessness, but it was straightforward and clear:

""If you want them to call you Chairman or President, that’s fine. Nobody cares.

But does it make any difference? Eventually, the meanings of ‘Chairman’ and ‘President’ will just turn into ‘Emperor.’

So, stop fooling yourself. What’s the point of going back and forth over this?""

Elo shook his head and replied calmly, ""There is a difference.""

Hearing this, Vian couldn’t help but laugh—a laugh full of sarcasm.

""Under normal circumstances, yes, it would matter. But this isn’t a normal situation.

Earth is gone, and all of human civilization is now reduced to these 10,000 people, along with life-sharing and Alaya.

And now, you’re telling me this is a normal situation?

These 10,000 survivors are all elites—not a single one of them is a fool.

Some may not have high academic credentials, but their overall abilities surpass those of university PhDs.

Do you think using the titles ‘Chairman’ or ‘President’ will deceive them in this context?

Dream on! Every one of them can see that you are, in essence, an emperor.

Most importantly…""

Here, Vian hesitated for a moment before finally speaking with resignation:

""A constitutional monarchy was already the result of a compromise between the government and parliament.

In reality, what they wanted was an absolute monarch because almost everyone understands how you view responsibility:

It’s not ‘the greater the ability, the greater the responsibility,’ it’s ‘the greater the public power and the more social resources one controls, the greater the responsibility.’

So, they chose an imperial system. Absolute power means absolute responsibility.

This was the result of a referendum.

If you don’t trust their referendum, you can go and ask all 10,000 of them.

10,000 isn’t a lot—it wouldn’t take long to ask them all.""

Elo’s emotions were complicated, and he instinctively rubbed his brow.

He didn’t fail to understand Vian’s words, but when the reality was laid before him, it still filled him with a deep sense of helplessness.

Vian was trying to make Elo fully grasp the current situation, so he wouldn’t regret today’s decisions in the future:

""Why are they pushing for an absolute monarchy?

It’s not because you are particularly wise and mighty, but because they believe an imperial system can bring more practical benefits.

Even under an imperial system, you still need to establish a government and delegate power to it, allowing the government to manage the nation on your behalf.

Whether through elections or not, your ministers will still have to be chosen from these 10,000 people.""

Vian looked at Elo and spoke earnestly:

“What advantages does absolute power bring?

Even if they haven’t studied this issue, they understand Alaya’s choice.

Is Alaya stupid? Impossible.

The most crucial point is this: it wasn’t Alaya that chose you—it was you who chose Alaya.

On the very first day, Alaya told us:

Alaya cannot observe you. It was only because you allowed Alaya to observe you that it discovered you.

The same goes for life-sharing, and even more so for the creation of the Ark Little World.”

At this point, Vian paused and turned to the Prime Minister.

""Explain to him clearly what this signifies.""

The Prime Minister took over the conversation, his demeanor more respectful than ever:

“Your Majesty, your existence has not only transformed humanity’s way of survival but has fundamentally redefined the future of civilization.

Technologically, life-sharing has made the lives of every survivor directly dependent on you.

As long as you live, we are free from aging, and even those who die can be resurrected.

This is not merely the continuation of life but a subversion of the natural order, elevating humanity’s logic of existence to an entirely new level.

In terms of resources, Alaya has achieved the ultimate optimization of resource allocation, making abundance a constant reality.

Even in the harshest environments, humanity can still create prosperity.

What’s even more critical is the existence of the Ark Little World, which stabilizes all of this.

As an independent space tied to your soul, the Little World possesses absolute security.

No matter how the external world collapses, even if the entire solar system is destroyed, the Little World will still exist independently.

Although the current scale of the Little World is limited, we firmly believe that, as conditions are met, its scale can expand to a minimum of solar-system-level capacity.

While internal resources within the Little World are finite, external resources can be replenished at any time.

This makes the Little World not just a refuge for survivors but the foundational cornerstone for the expansion and rebuilding of future civilization.”

“However, this is just the foundation.

Your existence transcends the concept of an ordinary leader; you have become the central symbol of human civilization.

You are not only the guarantor of our lives but also the spiritual pillar for humanity to rebuild order amidst the ruins.

Every decision you make not only shapes the current structure of human civilization but will also define the trajectory of civilization for thousands, even tens of thousands of years into the future.

This is not merely the continuation of human history but the prelude to an entirely new, glorious epic.

Such profound significance is unparalleled, exceeding even the most glorious eras of human history by an immeasurable degree!”

His mother’s lips curled faintly, a subtle smile rippling like a gentle wave before vanishing beneath her calm expression.

Vian nodded and concluded,

“So, you should feel fortunate that they didn’t directly call you ‘God.’”

Elo lowered his gaze, a trace of weariness appearing on his face.

He understood what Vian and the Prime Minister meant; he had already grasped these principles long before they even spoke.

And precisely because of this, the weight on his shoulders felt even heavier, like an unremovable shackle pressing down on him, making it hard to breathe.

His mother looked at him and spoke gently, her tone warm and kind:

""Let it be, alright? Don’t make things harder for the government; they’ve had a tough time over the years.""

Elo raised his head and met her gaze.

In her eyes, he saw emotions she hid well—there was concern, support, and a deeply buried sense of pride and satisfaction.

At that moment, Elo understood completely:

The reason these people dared to push for a constitutional monarchy, and even explore the possibility of an absolute monarchy, was precisely because of the support of his mother as an invisible ally.

She didn’t need to say anything to anyone, nor issue any orders to the government, because everyone already knew her intentions.

Her intentions were so transparent that even Elo could see through them.

Vian was right—the constitutional monarchy was the result of compromise by everyone involved. This was already the best possible outcome.

With resignation, Elo accepted it all and nodded. “Let’s do it this way.”

His mother smiled faintly, nodding in response. There was a hint of relief in her eyes, but she said nothing more.

Vian also remained silent, though the corner of her mouth curled into a barely noticeable smile.",1,1742126475.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1jcjste,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mr_Grim/comments/1jcjste/im_a_lighthouse_keeper_in_scotland_there_are/,I’m a Lighthouse Keeper in Scotland... There are STRANGE RULES to Follow !,"***(*** [***Narration***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzBTGfBnuCU) ***by Mr. Grim )***

*Have you ever noticed how lighthouses always seem to stand apart from the world, as if they exist in their own dimension of time and space? I've been a lighthouse keeper for twenty years now, and I can tell you with certainty - there's something about these towers that draws more than just ships to their light. I'm writing this account not to warn you, but to confess what happened during my final days at Oronsay Lighthouse. Maybe then you'll understand why Scotland's last manually operated lighthouse now stands abandoned, its beam forever dark against the northern sky.*

The path to Oronsay Lighthouse was treacherous even in the daylight. The narrow trail snaked along the jagged cliffs, with loose stones skittering down into the dark waves below. The lighthouse loomed ahead, its once-bright red-and-white stripes faded to a pale pink and dull gray, battered by decades of salt and wind. Its beam sliced through the mist in rhythmic sweeps, a steady reminder of its purpose: to guide lost ships to safety—or to warn them away from destruction.

My boots crunched on the gravel as I approached, each step bringing me closer to what would become my home for the foreseeable future. The maritime board had been surprisingly eager to fill this position, despite the remote location and the mysterious departure of the previous keeper. They'd practically thrust the keys into my hands, along with a hastily printed manual of operations that looked decades out of date.

The front door creaked as I pushed it open, revealing the cramped entryway. The air was damp and smelled faintly of seaweed, rust, and something sharper, like copper. An old oilskin coat hung by the door, stiff with age and still damp to the touch. A pair of muddy boots sat beneath it, far too large to be mine. Something about their positioning made them look as if their owner had simply vanished while wearing them, leaving them behind like an abandoned shell.

Inside, the lighthouse was a monument to isolation. The narrow spiral staircase wound upward, each step groaning under my weight as if protesting this intrusion into its solitude. Water stains marked the walls in strange patterns that seemed to shift when viewed from different angles. The keeper's office, a small room on the second floor, was cluttered with remnants of the past: a brass telescope with cracked lenses, nautical charts yellowed with age, and a dusty barometer that still ticked faintly, though its needle never moved.

It was there, beneath the desk, that I discovered the rules. The etchings were crude, jagged as though carved in desperation, the wood splintered around each letter as if the writer had used something other than a proper tool. My fingers traced the words, their meaning sinking in like cold water:

***The Rules:***

1. ***Never leave the lighthouse after sunset.***
2. ***If the foghorn blows more than three times, do not look out the windows.***
3. ***Always clean the lantern glass before dusk. Any smudge could let “them” in.***
4. ***If you hear knocking on the door after midnight, do not answer. No one will come this far at that hour.***
5. ***Once a month, leave an offering of fresh bread and milk on the cliff’s edge at sunrise. Do not look back while walking away.***
6. ***If the light goes out between 3:00 and 3:15 AM, stay absolutely still until it comes back on.***
7. ***Never touch the old logbook in the drawer under the desk.***
8. ***If you hear your own voice calling to you from outside, do not respond. It is not you.***

I stared at the carvings, the words pressing heavily into my mind. It must have been a joke—some sick prank by the previous keeper. But the raw edges of the letters, the deep gouges in the wood... it didn't feel like a joke. Some of the grooves still held traces of what looked like rust, but the coppery smell that rose from them made me think of something else entirely.

The unease followed me as I climbed to the lantern room. The massive lens turned slowly, its prisms catching and splitting the late afternoon light into rainbow fragments that danced across the walls. As I cleaned the glass, I couldn't shake the feeling that someone—or something—was watching me. In the reflection of the lens, I could have sworn I saw movement behind me, but when I turned, there was only the empty room and the endless sea beyond.

By the second night, the lighthouse felt alive in a way that made my skin crawl. Every creak of the floorboards, every groan of the wind seemed amplified, as though the building itself was breathing. The day had been spent maintaining the foghorn, my hands covered in grease as I checked its mechanisms and oil levels. It was an ancient beast of brass and iron, its fittings tarnished and green with corrosion, but somehow it still worked. The maritime board had mentioned it was scheduled for automated replacement next year. Now I understood why no one had bothered to modernize it - some things are better left untouched.

I'd established a routine - checking the weather instruments, recording readings in the new logbook (not the old one, never the old one), and watching the horizon for approaching vessels. The isolation was beginning to sink in. My phone had no signal here, and the satellite internet was temperamental at best. The only constant companion was the rhythmic sweep of the light above and the distant crash of waves below.

That night, the fog rolled in thick and fast, consuming the cliffs and sea until the world outside became a blank canvas of gray. I was in the office reviewing maintenance schedules when the foghorn blared its first warning, its mournful call reverberating through the lighthouse's bones.

Once. The sound shook dust from the rafters.

Twice. My coffee cup rattled against its saucer.

Three times. Normal procedure - warning ships of the treacherous rocks below.

I relaxed, reaching for my lukewarm coffee. But then came the fourth blast.

The sound was wrong - longer, shriller, as though the foghorn itself were screaming in terror. My hand froze halfway to my cup, the rules burning in my mind: ""If the foghorn blows more than three times, do not look out the windows.""

My instincts fought with my curiosity. The rational part of my brain said there must be a mechanical fault, something I'd missed during maintenance. But something deeper, more primal, whispered that looking outside would be the last mistake I'd ever make.

The stillness between blasts was absolute. No wind. No waves. Even the usual creaks of the lighthouse had fallen silent, as if the building itself was holding its breath.

The fifth blast shattered the quiet like a hammer through glass.

I turned toward the window, my body moving before my mind could stop it. Through the thick fog, shapes moved - tall, spindly figures that seemed to ripple like waves. Their outlines were barely visible, but their movements were wrong. Too smooth, too fast, as though they were gliding rather than walking. One of them stopped directly in my line of sight, turning toward the lighthouse. Though I couldn't make out any features in the gray murk, I knew with bone-deep certainty that it could see me.

A high-pitched keening filled my ears as I slammed the shutters closed and backed away, my heart threatening to burst from my chest. The foghorn fell silent, its echo dying away into nothing. But then came a new sound - the soft, deliberate scratch of something sharp against wood, tracing slow patterns on the outside of the shutters.

I spent the rest of the night huddled in the corner of the office, my back pressed against the wall, listening to that methodical scratching. When dawn finally came, I forced myself to check the shutters. Deep grooves marked the wood in elaborate, swirling patterns that almost looked like words in a language I couldn't read - and didn't want to understand.

The fog had retreated with the morning light, but as I looked out across the calm sea, I couldn't shake the feeling that those figures were still out there, waiting for me to break another rule.

The third day dawned gray and overcast, the kind of morning where the line between sea and sky blurred into a single sheet of slate. I'd barely slept, my dreams filled with the echo of that endless scratching and glimpses of impossibly tall figures moving through fog. My morning coffee tasted like ash in my mouth.

The air was thick with the smell of salt and wet earth as I climbed the spiral staircase to the lantern room. Each step felt heavier than the last, as though something was trying to keep me from reaching the top. The light's steady sweep was my only comfort now, a beacon of normalcy in the chaos the night had brought. Rule three echoed in my mind: ""Always clean the lantern glass before dusk. Any smudge could let 'them' in.""

I was halfway through my usual cleaning routine when I noticed it. At first, it looked like a simple smear on the glass, the kind left by seabirds or salt spray. But as I moved closer, my stomach dropped through the floor. It wasn't just a smudge—it was a handprint.

The print was skeletal, each finger impossibly long and thin, stretching nearly two feet from palm to tip. The worst part was its location - on the outside of the glass, hundreds of feet above the rocks, where no human could possibly reach without extensive climbing gear. The fingers seemed to ripple slightly in the morning light, as though they were still wet, still fresh.

My throat constricted as I forced myself to clean it, the cloth trembling in my hand. The smudge resisted at first, smearing rather than wiping away. It felt cold under the cloth, colder than the surrounding glass, and seemed to leave faint trails of frost in its wake. When it finally disappeared, I could have sworn I heard a soft sigh from outside.

Back in the office, I tried to calm my nerves with another cup of coffee. That's when I saw it - another handprint, this time on the inside of the window by the desk. It was smaller than the one upstairs, but the fingers were still unnaturally elongated. As I stared at it, my blood turning to ice, I realized something that made my heart stop: it was still being formed, the glass slowly frosting over in the shape of a skeletal hand, as though something invisible was pressing against it from my side of the window.

I stumbled back, knocking over my chair. The handprint completed itself with agonizing slowness, and then, as I watched, a single fingertip began to move, scratching four words into the frost:

""We see you, James.""

The maritime board's manual said nothing about this. Nothing about handprints that appeared from nowhere, nothing about foghorns that screamed into the night, nothing about the rules carved into the desk. I fumbled for my phone, desperate to call someone, anyone - but the screen showed only static, and through the speaker came a sound like waves, and beneath them, distant laughter.

When I finally worked up the courage to approach the window again, the handprint and its message had vanished, leaving no trace on the glass. But as I leaned closer, I noticed something that shocked my to my core: my own reflection seemed slightly out of sync with my movements, its eyes meeting mine a fraction of a second too late.

I spent the rest of the day checking and rechecking every window in the lighthouse, cleaning each pane until my arms ached. But I couldn't shake the feeling that with each smudge I removed, I was somehow giving them exactly what they wanted - another clean surface to reach through, another clear path into my world.

The wind picked up as evening approached, battering the lighthouse with gusts that made the walls shudder and moan. I sat at the desk, pretending to focus on the maintenance logs while my mind wandered back to the handprints, the figures in the fog, the rules that seemed more like prayers against the darkness than regulations.

My dinner sat untouched beside me - a sad affair of canned beans and stale bread. The isolation was starting to wear on me. Four days since I'd spoken to another human being. Four days of nothing but the wind, the waves, and the increasingly unsettling sounds that echoed through the lighthouse's hollow spaces.

I glanced at my watch: 11:58 PM. The rules had made me obsessive about time. In a place like this, minutes could mean the difference between safety and... whatever fate had befallen the previous keeper.

Then it started.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The sound was so clear, so deliberate, that for a moment I thought I'd imagined it. Three perfect knocks, evenly spaced, as though someone was keeping time.

I checked my watch again: 12:01 AM. My heart rate spiked. The rules screamed in my mind: ""If you hear knocking on the door after midnight, do not answer. No one will come this far at that hour.""

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The same pattern, but louder now. I stared at the office door, watching the old iron latch rattle slightly with each impact. The wind had died completely, leaving an unnatural stillness in its wake. The absence of its howl made the knocking seem even louder, more insistent.

Then came the voice - a low, rasping whisper that barely rose above the silence, yet somehow filled the entire room.

""James... let me in.""

I backed away from the door, my chest so tight I could barely breathe. That voice - I knew it. It was impossible, but I knew it. It belonged to my brother Michael, who had disappeared off the coast of Norway two years ago. His body had never been found.

""James, please... I'm so cold out here. Just let me in.""

My brother's voice, exactly as I remembered it, down to the slight catch in his throat when he was upset. But Michael was gone. I'd identified his personal effects when they washed ashore - his wallet, his watch, his wedding ring.

""Jimmy..."" The nickname he'd used since we were kids. ""Jimmy, why won't you help me?""

Something scratched at the door, a slow, dragging sound like fingernails on wood. The latch began to turn, metal grinding against metal with excruciating slowness. I watched, paralyzed, as it lifted a fraction of an inch...

Then stopped.

The silence that followed was absolute. No breathing from the other side of the door, no footsteps retreating, nothing. Just the weight of something waiting.

I don't know how long I stood there, muscles cramped from tension, watching that latch. Hours maybe. The first hint of dawn was touching the horizon when I finally found the courage to approach the door.

There were new marks on the wood - deep grooves that spelled out words in my brother's handwriting: ""I'm still drowning, Jimmy. Every day, I'm still drowning.""

Below the words was a perfect impression of his hand - the same hand I'd shaken at the dock the morning he left for his last voyage. But the fingers were wrong, stretched and distorted like those in the handprints on the glass.

I spent the rest of the night researching the lighthouse's history on my failing laptop. In the past century, seventeen ships had wrecked on the rocks below. In each case, survivors reported seeing lights on the cliffs, hearing familiar voices calling them toward the rocks. The lighthouse's beam, they said, had seemed to guide them straight into disaster.

The dawn came reluctantly, as if the sun itself was hesitant to illuminate what lurked in the darkness. The sky was streaked with ash-gray clouds, and a pale, watery light barely pierced the horizon. My hands shook as I checked my calendar - it was the first of the month. The rule echoed in my mind: ""Once a month, leave an offering of fresh bread and milk on the cliff's edge at sunrise. Do not look back while walking away.""

I hadn't slept after the night's events. The memory of Michael's voice, the scratches in his handwriting - they'd kept me awake, huddled in the corner of the office with my back against the wall. But rules were rules, and something told me breaking this one would be worse than facing whatever waited outside.

The unease from the previous night lingered as I prepared the offering in the lighthouse's small kitchen. The bread was from my meager supplies, slightly stale but serviceable. I'd found the tin pitcher in a cupboard, its surface dulled with age but still intact. The milk inside caught what little light filtered through the window, its surface gleaming faintly like mother-of-pearl.

As I gathered the items, I noticed something odd about the pitcher - tiny engravings around its rim that looked like waves. But as I looked closer, I realized they were actually hundreds of miniature faces, mouths open in silent screams.

The path to the cliff's edge seemed longer than usual. The mist clung to my legs like a living thing, curling around my ankles and seeping through my clothes. It carried the scent of salt and decay, and something else - a sweet, cloying smell that reminded me of the flowers at Michael's memorial service.

Each step was more precarious than the last. The rocks were slick with morning dew, and the mist made it impossible to see more than a few feet ahead. The crashing waves below were muffled, as though the fog itself was swallowing the sound.

As I reached the cliff's edge, the wind died suddenly, and the air grew heavy and thick. The sea stretched endlessly before me, a flat expanse of gray-green water that seemed unnaturally still. No waves, no movement - just a vast mirror reflecting the colorless sky above.

I placed the bread and milk on the rocks, my hands trembling. The pitcher made a hollow sound as it touched the stone, like a bell rung underwater. The bread seemed to darken the moment it left my hands, as though it was aging rapidly in the salt air.

""Don't look back,"" I whispered to myself, the rule repeating in my mind like a mantra. I turned, each movement feeling like I was fighting against an invisible current.

The wind picked up again, but it carried more than just the usual ocean sounds. Whispers, dozens of them, overlapping and unintelligible but insistent. My skin crawled as I fought the urge to glance over my shoulder.

Then one voice rose above the others, clear as a bell: ""James... why are you leaving us?""

Michael's voice again, but not alone this time. Behind it, I could hear others - our father, who'd died when we were young; our grandmother; my high school friend who'd drowned at the beach. All calling my name, all asking why I wouldn't stay.

I stopped, my breath hitching. My feet wavered, every muscle screaming to turn around. The voices grew more desperate, more pleading. Something brushed against my back, light as a feather but cold as ice.

But I remembered the rules. I forced myself forward, one step at a time, even as the whispers turned to wails of despair. When I finally reached the lighthouse door, the voices stopped abruptly, leaving behind a silence so complete it felt like cotton in my ears.

Hours later, when I couldn't stand not knowing any longer, I returned to the cliff. The offering was gone - not a crumb of bread, not a drop of milk remained. But carved into the rocks where I'd left them were deep grooves that formed words:

""Thank you, little brother. See you next month.""

Below the words was the image of a lighthouse, rendered in perfect detail. But in its windows were faces - dozens of them, pressed against the glass, looking out at the sea with hollow eyes.

The sixth night started deceptively peacefully. The wind was gentle, almost playful, and the waves below had settled into a rhythmic lull. I sat in the keeper's office, surrounded by stacks of old maintenance records I'd been using to distract myself. My watch read 2:47 AM.

As I flipped through the yellowed pages, I found myself questioning whether I'd been overreacting. Maybe the isolation was getting to me. Maybe I was seeing patterns where there were only coincidences. The logical part of my mind tried to explain away the handprints, the voices, the carvings in the rocks. After all, lighthouses were known for playing tricks on their keepers' minds. The maritime board's manual had a whole section on ""maintaining psychological equilibrium in isolated conditions.""

I glanced at the barometer - it hadn't moved since I arrived, its needle frozen at ""FAIR"" despite the constantly changing weather. But as I watched, the needle twitched slightly, then began to drop rapidly. The glass face frosted over, despite the warmth of the room.

Then, at precisely 3:05 AM, the light went out.

The sudden darkness was absolute, crushing. The familiar hum of the machinery died, leaving a silence so complete I could hear my own heartbeat. The rules flashed in my mind: ""If the light goes out between 3:00 and 3:15 AM, stay absolutely still until it comes back on.""

I froze, my hands gripping the edge of the desk. The darkness pressed against my eyes like a physical weight. My watch ticked loudly in the silence - 3:06 AM. Nine more minutes to endure.

Then came the footsteps.

They started at the bottom of the tower, soft and deliberate. Not the heavy boots of a maintenance worker or the hurried steps of someone coming to help. These were slow, measured, almost delicate. Each step was followed by a slight dragging sound, like something being pulled across the metal stairs.

3:08 AM. The footsteps reached the first landing.

The temperature plummeted. My breath came out in visible puffs, and frost began forming on the desk under my fingers. The windows rattled slightly, though there was no wind.

3:10 AM. Second landing. The dragging sound was louder now, accompanied by a wet sliding noise that made my stomach turn.

The darkness seemed to thicken, if that was possible. I could feel it pressing against my skin, probing, searching. The air took on a heavy, metallic taste that reminded me of blood.

3:12 AM. The footsteps stopped just outside the office door. The handle began to rattle.

I clenched my teeth, every muscle in my body rigid with fear. My watch seemed impossibly loud in the silence - tick, tick, tick.

Then a voice - my voice - whispered from the other side: ""James, let me in. I need your help.""

The words were mine, but the tone was wrong. It was like hearing a recording played at slightly the wrong speed. Behind it, I could hear other voices, dozens of them, all whispering my name in that same distorted way.

3:13 AM. The handle turned fully, but the door didn't open. Instead, something pressed against it, making the wood creak and bend inward. In the darkness, I could see the door bulging as if something massive was trying to force its way through.

I kept absolutely still, remembering the rules. My legs cramped from tension, and sweat froze on my forehead despite the cold.

At exactly 3:14 AM, the light flickered back to life. The footsteps retreated - faster now, almost fleeing - and the temperature began to rise. When the door finally swung open on its own, the hallway was empty.

But something had changed. The light from the lantern room above seemed different - dimmer somehow, and tinged with a subtle greenish hue that reminded me of deep water. And in its beam, I could see that the walls of the office were now covered in tiny handprints, as if made by children's hands.

When I checked the maintenance log later, I found an entry from exactly 100 years ago: ""Third time this month the light has gone out at 3 AM. Each time, they get closer to breaking through. God help the keeper who lets them in.""

After six days of following the rules, of resisting every urge to understand what was happening, I finally broke. The logbook - the one I was specifically forbidden to touch - called to me from its hiding place beneath the desk. Something about last night's events had pushed me past the point of caution. I needed answers more than I needed safety.

My hands trembled as I pulled it from its resting place. The leather cover was cracked and brittle, its surface marked with strange patterns that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them. The binding was secured with a brass clasp that was ice-cold to the touch, despite the warmth of the morning sun streaming through the window.

The moment I broke the seal, the air in the room changed. The sunlight dimmed, and that coppery smell - the one I'd noticed on my first day - grew stronger. From somewhere deep in the lighthouse, I heard the foghorn give a single, quiet moan, like a warning.

The first pages were exactly what you'd expect from a lighthouse log: neat columns of dates, times, weather conditions. Ship sightings. Maintenance records. But as I turned the pages, things began to change. The handwriting became more erratic, the entries less professional.

Entry from 1912: ""The fog is alive. It moves with purpose, and I swear I saw something inside it. A shape. Watching. It stands at the edge of the light's reach, always just out of clear view. The other keepers say I'm seeing things, but I know what I saw. It had my wife's face, but wrong somehow. She's been dead for three years.""

The ink on this entry was brown and flaking, and the paper felt damper than it should.

Entry from 1943: ""The knocking started again last night. It was louder this time, more insistent. They're using new voices now - the men from the fishing boat that went down last week. I can hear them drowning, over and over, begging me to let them in. I fear I won't last much longer. The rules are the only thing keeping them out, but my resolve is weakening. Sometimes I think I see my own face in the crowd outside.""

This entry was written in what looked like green-black seaweed ink, the words slightly raised on the page.

Entry from 1977: ""I broke the rule. I looked back at the offering. It saw me. It knows my name now. They all know my name. They're in the mirrors, in the windows, in every reflection. Always smiling, always waving, always drowning. The light doesn't keep them out anymore - it draws them in. We were wrong about its purpose. So wrong.""

The writing here was shaky, desperate. The pages were stained with what looked like saltwater, and small handprints marked the margins.

But it was the final entry that made my blood freeze:

""To the next keeper: The light isn't for the ships. It's for them. If it goes out, they'll come. And they will take you. Like they took us. All of us. Every keeper before you. We're still here, you see. Still watching. Still keeping the light. But not for the ships. Never for the ships.

P.S. - You should have followed the rules, James. Now you've read this, you're one of us. Or you will be. When the light goes out.""

The entry was dated tomorrow.

As I stared at the impossible date, I noticed something else - my own reflection in the brass fittings of the logbook. But my face was all wrong. My eyes were dark pools of seawater, and my smile was too wide, filled with things that looked like fish bones.

The foghorn blew in the distance. Once. Twice. Three times.

I slammed the book shut, but I could still feel it pulsing in my hands, like a living heart. And somewhere, far below, I heard the first footstep on the spiral staircase.

The final night began like the ending of a nightmare—except I couldn't wake up. The foghorn blared its warning across the dark waters: once, twice, three times. I held my breath, clutching the cursed logbook to my chest, knowing what would come next.

The fourth blast came—longer, louder, more guttural than ever before. It didn't sound like machinery anymore; it sounded like the lighthouse itself was screaming.

I ran up the spiral staircase toward the lantern room, my flashlight beam dancing wildly across the walls. The steps felt wrong under my feet—softer somehow, as if the metal had become organic, pulsing with each step. Water trickled down the walls, but it moved upward instead of down, defying gravity.

When I reached the lantern room, my heart nearly stopped. The glass was smeared with handprints—hundreds of them, overlapping and writhing as though they were alive. They weren't just pressed against the glass; they were moving, shifting, fingers elongating and contracting like sea anemones. I recognized some of them—the delicate fingers of my grandmother, the scarred palm of my father, the small hands of the children from the fishing boat that sank in '98.

The knocking started again, but this time it came from everywhere—every door, every window, every surface of the lighthouse resonated with that rhythmic pounding. It was frantic, desperate, deafening. The very air seemed to vibrate with the force of it.

I tried to barricade myself in the lantern room, dragging the old maintenance chest against the door. The logbook pulsed in my hands like a living heart, its pages fluttering open by themselves, revealing new entries written in script that dripped and moved across the page:

""Welcome home, James."" ""You're almost one of us now."" ""The light is fading, brother.""

The massive lens began to rotate faster than it should, its beam cutting through the darkness like a blade. But with each sweep, the light grew dimmer, and the darkness between beams grew longer. In those moments of blackness, I saw them—shapes moving in the glass, pressing through like bodies under thin ice.

The shadows in the room began to move, pooling together into a single, towering figure. It was like looking at a hole in the world, a space where reality simply stopped. But its voice—God, its voice was unmistakable.

""You've broken the rules, James. It's time to join us."" Michael's voice, but not just his. Behind it were hundreds of others, all speaking in unison, all calling my name.

I backed away, my heart hammering so hard I thought it would burst. The figure reached out with fingers like twisted coral, brushing the edge of the great lens. Where it touched, the glass frosted over instantly, patterns of ice spreading like fractured webs.

The light flickered once, twice—and went out.

In that last moment of darkness, I saw my reflection in the glass. But it wasn't me anymore. The face staring back had eyes like the depths of the ocean, a mouth full of coral and seaweed, skin that rippled like the surface of dark water. It smiled at me with my brother's smile, reached for me with hands that had written in that logbook for over a hundred years.

""The light was never for the ships,"" it whispered in a thousand voices. ""It was to keep us in.""

*When the maritime board finally investigated two weeks later, they found the lighthouse empty. The logbook was gone, the lantern glass shattered. Deep, claw-like gouges marked every wall, spelling out words in dozens of different hands: ""HOME AT LAST.""*

*The lighthouse remains dark now, deemed too dangerous for automated conversion. But locals tell stories of strange lights on the cliffs at night, and some swear they've heard voices—low, desperate, and faintly familiar—calling from the fog.*

*They say if you listen carefully on quiet nights, you can hear someone calling out across the water: ""James... let me in."" But it's not just one voice anymore. It's hundreds, all speaking together, all keeping their eternal watch over the dark waters of Oronsay Light.*

*And sometimes, on the darkest nights, ships report seeing a figure in the lighthouse window. A keeper, they say, still maintaining his post. But those who look too long notice something strange about his movements, something fluid and wrong, like a man moving underwater.*

*They say he waves to passing ships, inviting them closer to shore. And sometimes, if the fog is thick and the night is dark enough, they say his smile stretches just a little too wide, filled with things that glisten like fish scales in the dark.*

*After all, there must always be a keeper at Oronsay Light. The rules demand it.*

I have all sorts of interests but I guess my main ones would be reading, being outdoors, watching the occasional show and playing the occasional video game, but those are usually single-player ones. Also enjoy learning about different places all over the world, especially any strange lore that is geographical based.

My girlfriend was happiest being around her friends and family.  On top of that, I really don't want to feel sad or in the depths of despair today.  I want to live today as she would have.

So lately it’s been hard, we live in temporary accommodation and nothing is changing, my mum said it will, like it’s always me waking her up with coffee in bed or when I’m upstairs I have to come down and make her coffee or tea.. keep in mind her bedroom is downstairs. My older brother calls me horrible names in my opinion everyday I get called
 
Dumb in my head
A freak 
Retard 
Idiot
Dumb bitch 
Not quite 18 in the brain yet
Soft freak 

I’ve noticed these have taking a big toll on me I can’t do things I like by playing video games or reading my favourite books ( heart stopper books) without thinking about what he calls me. To the point I don’t feel like I wanna be here cus these no point. Maybe I am being a freak.  I also feel like my anti depressants aren’t working very well I still feel like I wanna ya know? anyways I told my mum that yesterday she asked me why I have to take everything to the extreme. But that’s how I feel, I really do. I feel numb in this family or when I feel something I cry and  cry and cry until I feel like I’m going to drown in my own tears, she said I need to check myself out because I bring everybody down in the house and I am the mood controller. 

I know I’m not though because when someone is sad I feel sad as well when I know they are down and I think it’s all my fault even though I’ve been in my room avoiding them all day. I blame myself deeply today she said I’m 18 and I need to know when she has to cancel something and get over it.
She means my guitar lessons I haven’t played my guitar lessons in forever cus she keep s cancelling them I haven’t played them for a month and my high e string is broken and she keeps telling me she’ll get it fixed. You’ll probably say you’re 18 you lil freak  why can’t you go? cus I can’t drive and I can hardly hold eye contact with people and I have bad anxiety it would take me like ten minutes to ask for help 

She also said I get upset of how people talk to me and snap fast but she doesn’t feel my hurt when I was ten my aunt took her top off and shook her chest in my face and I awkwardly laughed. Until I was 17 and I told ny mum how I felt and she was mad at me told me to get over it and she didn’t mean to make me uncomfortable she’s my aunt and I hold a grudge against everyone who dose me wrong, but I never get a sorry they think time dose it what it dosent so back to here my brother keeps rubbing in my face that this summer we are going on holiday to see them. I’m not I really don’t want to cus it she did that to my brother it would be a different story. I’ll like to say my mum also said to me it’s okay cus I laughed when she did it. I was ten. But okay. She also told my aunt and one time she came and I didn’t make eye contact and she kept saying she was disappointed I didn’t come up and give her a hug. 

My guitar lesson mean everything to me. It dose love them so much they are the only thing keeping me going at the moment, a part of me wants to cry to my guitar teacher about how I feel and I’m scared to cus what if somehow it gets passed back to my mum? so im crying here on the internet knowing no one will take their time out of their day to read this

Hi, 

I am 34, male, from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 

My interests and hobbies include (but are not limited to): playing sports (badminton, squash, table tennis etc); fitness/gym; watching movies 
(my favourite film genre is horror movies); reading; socialising; going out for coffees; going out for dinner; going to pubs and clubs; learning about new languages and cultures; cooking; playing pool, and bowling; travelling and sightseeing; gaming etc. 

If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same thing, or feels they may share some of the same interests or values as me, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and chat and connect.

Choice of cheese: provolone, Pepper Jack, American, or our house Southwest-style Wisconsin melted queso, dusted with chilli flakes and arugula, for a small four dollar surcharge. Bob, this sounds crazy, but I’m in. If we do this, can people at least get a regular burger with ketchup-Gilmore, are you even familiar with the-the concept? We will offer something even better: house sauce. Uh, get this: We take, uh, farm fresh applewood-smoked ketchup and blast it with free range garlic aioli, and throw in a dash of pickle juice for a little extra kick. I’m sold, Bob! But can each menu item be printed in its own quirky font and none of the prices have dollar signs? I’m way ahead of you, Gilmore. We’ll price everything in cents, not dollars, so a handheld will run you 3,489 cents and a cup of coffee will be 529 cents. Uh, and the whole time we’ll play all the hits from, uh, The Lumineers, fun., and my personal favourite, Mumford & Sons.

so I've been seeing this guy for a few weeks. we both have full-time jobs so we go on dates on the weekend and just text during the week. today I'm gonna be seeing him for the 3rd time and this is my first time going on dates with a guy like this. (my ex-bf and only romantic experience we met through a mutual friend and just took it from there).  
on the first date we just talked for a really long time (like 4 hours) and went to his fav food places he wanted to show me and he was very gentlemanly and sweet and I enjoyed it, we just hugged good bye.

then on our second date we watched a movie, and then spontaneously went to karaoke, coffee, food, and then a drink at a bar (the date was like 10 hours LMAO) and things got a little bit touchy at the bar, like he has his hand on my thigh and shoulder and I had my leg wrapped around his or something BUT WE DID NOT KISS (I didn't really want to this early). it was definitely nice and I enjoyed it even though deep down I was lowk terrified 😭. today we're gonna be going to an art gallery, book store and probably coffee + food. I think I definitely like him now, and I think he does too.  
what im wondering is if this is a normal progression for romantic dates? I think one of the issues is we both still live with family and so I'm curious how that will play out and if it is feasible. I do overthink and I think maybe im comparing this situation with this modern view of dating where people have sex + kiss really quickly, and I know I'm definitely not capable of that kind of dating (im pretty sure im demisexual). maybe the issue is that I am just overthinking and I should just enjoy that its a slower burn and enjoy whatever happens.

is this normal? thanks people! <3

There don't seem to be any Michelin starred restaurants in Chiang Mai, but having been recommended for 5 years, with their new menu I think Redbox absolutely deserve one.

Dan the chef and his partner were super nice coming out to chat. Service was good and drinks were unique and interesting.

All the dishes were great, with well balanced middle spice levels befitting a Thai based food restaurant.

The chicken skewers are a must, the peanut sauce the best I ever had.

The cod was super crunchy and great texture all the way through, reminding me of crispy khao soi noodles.

The oyster sequence with tomato salsa and broth was also great and an umami surprise.

The lamb supplement was juicy and the Thai rice cake a spicy meaty aside to it. The duck breast was to the same high standard.

The smoked coconut ice cream with palm sugar another surprise.

Basically if you're in Chiang Mai and want some real Thai/Asian food flavour experience then have a look at Redbox.

So I’m a 26F. A 1st year med student. 
Ever since I was a kid (I’ve been legit). Seriously now, I have always been the tall/big kid. 
Though, not morbidly obese. I’m just tall (for a Filipino), but I’m half foreigner, therefore the height. Height is 171cms, current weight is 78kgs. Lightest weight I’ve ever achieved is 75kgs before med school, and when I was doing strict calorie counting and constant exercise. 

My goal is to reach 60kgs. And finally feel confident in my body. At the same time, being able to focus with school. 

I just started out with calorie counting and working out a week ago, and for some days, I felt lighter, some days I felt heavier. 

Current routine (because of medschool, so it’s usually 7:30am-6pm daily):
- I fast at around 9:30pm until 10am. 
- no breakfast, unless it’s black coffee 
- I try to at least reach 5k steps while in school. 
- when I get home at 6/7/8, I try to walk 5k more steps on my treadmill just to reach 10k steps, but sometimes, I just aim for 8k steps daily. 
- I count calories, and always maintain consuming less than 1100kcal a day. I drink around 3/4 L of water daily. 

BUT ON WEEKENDS, 2 days a week, I don’t workout or count calories. Idk, med school is just draining and there’s so much to do. During these 2 days, i eat around 1 cup of rice a day, eat a bar of chocolate, or enjoy my favorite pouch of caramel popcorn. 

Now, I’m feeling guilty, and just thinking that I’m gonna be forever big. 

What do you think, and what would your suggestions be? 

My goal is to lose as much weight as possible. Not build muscles yet.

1jcinly,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1jcinly/ftb_little_vent_another_completion_didnt_go/,"FTB Little vent, another ""completion didn't go through"" post","Heya all, prefacing this with the fact having lurked this Reddit the amount of push notifications with people in all sorts of terrible and ridiculous situations has made me realise what a joke England and Wales is with it's housing laws. 

I'm doing this mostly just to throw my upset out there above all else. Whilst I'm stuck waiting for the situation to develop. 

Context FTB, no chain, solicitors for buyer and seller assigned by estate agent

In any case my offer was accepted back in November and it was taken off the market since then I've done all my searches, surveys, got insurance, done everything my solicitor wanted and we're ready to exchange:
- met with the sellers on 3rd Mar, they were very hospitable and answered all the questions. Gave me a price on a coffee table and said they'd get back to me on an electric heater price. They also confirmed once again they're happy with the 14th March (I had wrote them a letter a week before about it)
- 4th Mar I have insurance taken out and my solicitor is ready to exchange, it takes until 6th or 7th before sellers solicitor comes back to confirm sellers are agreeable to 14th for completion the solicitors just need final redemption statements from a mortgage lender
-11th March until 13th I'm chasing each day waiting for confirmation exchange had happened (my solicitor thought it'd be done by Monday), on the 12th I get a price for the electric heater directly from seller
- 13th rolls around and we're almost done packing. My parents and I have booked time off work. After exhausting with the solicitor, sales progressor and estate agent I call the seller. He's very apologetic and blames a mixture of my solicitor / the lender, is worried I'm going to pull out the sale and when I suggest if we could still come up because furniture is scheduled to arrive and he says we could move in Sunday 16th potentially just for the few days this goes through, he said he'll speak to his wife
- I wait an hour, try calling him a few times, the first two times it goes to voicemail, third I leave a voicemail and text him basically saying can you let me know what's going on because I have a hotel booked I need to amend. 
- he responds saying speak to your solicitor on text. I assume he spoke with his wife and solicitor so now he doesn't want to talk to me which is fine I guess. He's moving into his new property on the 15th and he's emptied out 80% of the contents so this must have all been a suprise to him to.

I call my solicitor and they call their solicitor and it turns out the problem is the sellers have two mortgages. One of which is with an obscure lender which is having it's comms managed by a solicitor. This is the reason why they've been trying for however many days or weeks to get an those final redemption statements with no success.

I did see an e-mail from their solicitor doing the whole legal speak about how I'm causing them distress by asking for them to receive furniture.

My train ticket is forfeit, but I was able to cancel the furniture delivery and the house insurance. I've cancelled post redirected but once that goes through I'll be charged a £10 penalty. I've let the council know to cancel my DD,  but wasn't able to stop a small Amazon delivery yesterday. I own their broadband line now and am paying for it and they're fortunate I went with the same provider so they shouldn't be impacted but in just over a week I will be forced to cancel it under the cool down policy of be forced to fulfil a 24 month contract.

Of course everyone has their opinion on whose fault this was but regardless I've lost a little money, my father a day of work, and I've had to spend this weekend unpacking and commiserating. The owners are obviously incredibly embarrassed, guilty and frustrated and I doubt the flowers and letters my colleagues friends and family sent will help that. 

Both solicitors are annoyed, my family is distraught, I'm disappointed, their family is presumably embarassed and now frustrated because they're paying the mortgage on an empty house and whatever the agreement is on their place now.

I'm hoping this will be all water under the bridge and those redemption statements will materialise and I'll have a new date by end of the month. But my solicitor said to me that it could be weeks or months.

I hope I get to move soon and never have to go through this process again because it's been making me so unwell.",0,1742121277.0,HousingUK,19,0.4,False

New years eve 2023 I made a decision to quit. I was out watching the fireworks and downed half a bottle of brandy to ”solidify” the decision… oh boy

It took a couple of months to get to a Day 1 but it was exactly like this day. Saturday night that managed to stay sober and wake up to Sunday so fresh and so clean. The high was life changing. 

That Sunday I decided to quit coffee as well and started drinking tea instead - now I brew two glass jars of lemonized ice-tea from a wide selection of black, green, mate, rooibos, herbal

That Sunday I restarted my old yoga-routine that had been on a long break for at least a decade (kids, marriage, work etc excuses)
Now I go through 1-2h yoga-excersize-meditation-y-choung-tai-chi combo almost every day. I have lost some weight. Motivation and focus are better, I feel like a champ as I used to feel like a chump. 

I used the ”pink cloud energy” to the fullest and got a handfull of projects going on. Still going on. 
I started eating healthier and more veggie/vegan diet. Not completely cause my kid (6yo) still wants her hot digs and meat balls and so on. 
And I still destroy chips and candy like my life depended on them. I try to get out more and make it count. 

Last spring will definitely be the turning point in my life, and it’s about f**ing time too. I’m turning 46 on May. 

I learned so much about myself during the first months. I relapsed a few times in the autumn, a fall fell if you please. And I learned so much more collecting my soul from the floor recovering from the resulting mental relapse. It made me stronger and more willing to push through. 

All very well, couldn’t be prouder, and being proud of myself is not a common thing. I’m GenX and ignored and forgotten by parents and society for decades. I’d say any warm feelings about myself, are luke warm at best and still artificial. 
But I do feel good. Really good. Better than ever even, since I started drinking at 13 or 14 (wtf)

I had a sober year on 2015-16 in hind sight I should’ve stayed on the wagon then. 
2019 a divorce I didn’t want was the final straw. 2020-2024 I downed a bottle of whiskey/vodka/brandy every single day. 
Beer I quit somewhere around 2021/22 cause it just didn’t do it for me, only got me bloated and fat. 
I never went to a doctor. I never went to AA. 
I didn’t seek any help from anyone. My family pretty much left me alone after hearing I don’t drink - I used to be a reliant drinking buddy for them. 

But you wanna know what happened on that Saturday last year, before my Day 1?

I found r/stopdrinking by accident



I should end it there for dramatic reasons but I still want to thank everyone on this sub and couple of other subs as well, for the billionth time. Thank You for saving my life. I will and I have been trying to return the favor. After all, this is just Year 1

We received our robot a few days ago, and although I don’t drink coffee myself, I really like the machine and make coffee for my wife. So far, I’ve been able to dial it in using fresh coffee beans and an old hand grinder. Everything’s been going well—I'm doing a pre-infusion for about 10 seconds, then ramping up to 6-7 bars, and my wife enjoys it. I still do not get nice crema, but hope I will get there soon.

The issue now is that she wants to be able to make coffee when I'm not around, and the hand grinder isn’t ideal for her. We’re looking for something electric, but I’m guessing it’s hard to find anything decent for under 100 Euros. We are in Germany and not all names are available in Europe (I guess).

So far, I found out that Baratza Encore could be a solution, but I am not sure.

Do you have any recommendations for electric grinders that could be found used within that budget? The more options, the better, as it’ll increase my chances of finding something good. Also, are there any specific things I should check when buying a used grinder?

I am 53, and I feel pretty fit for my age. I am still very active, with very high testosterone level (blood test). 

I love and must exercise. I typically exercise twice a week, where my preferable routine is:

* 1 minute with indoor rower where I cover from 270 to 300 meters
* then 1 set of 10 Spider-Man pushups, 
* then 1 set of 5–7 pull-ups. 
* During a 45-55 minute workout, I am able to perform 7 to 10 sets, depending on the day.

# As I love being active and have a lot of energy, I wonder if such a routine of short workouts would make sense?

When I start my day, before a cup of coffee or Yerba maté, I perform a quicky with such an iron lady:

* 10 Spider-Man pushups.
* 10 dips
* 10 pull-ups
* 10 squats
