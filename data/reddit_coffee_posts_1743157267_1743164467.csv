So i got a moka pot to try a more concentrated coffee but  ended up tasting  bitter and watery with( 100% is probably my mistake). 
I followed james hoffman’s vidoep,but skipped out on the aeropress filter.
Would love any suggestions and tips to better my moka pot technique and coffee beans that have a chocolatey note. Thank you in advance 

And have anyone tried padma or josephs coffee from tamil nadu, should i try it?

I’ve been chatting for a while on Reddit just for fun, and loving it.
This one man messaged me  a while back and we were having great convos. He’s also from the same city and immigrated from the same country, he was polite funny and didn’t seem interested in sex or perusing anything other than good convos. He’s married and has been trying to convince his wife they should open their marriage, or at least explore the hotwife dynamic.

Needless to say she’s been hesitant.

A couple weeks ago we met up for lunch and that’s all it was a lunch good convo and he has an amazing sense of humour. Not once did anything sexual come up. 

Fast forward to this weekend and his wife and kids are away, we met up at a coffee shop, it was rather busy he did make the joke that his house is empty so I said why not. I got in his car and he drove to his place. 

Inside I took of my jacket and shoes, he held my hand and slowly walked into me and we started kissing and making out. He took me to the sofa where we sat down and he pulled my sweater and bra off sucked on my nipples while he was unbuttoning my jeans and pulling them off. He slid my panty to the side and rubbed my clit, slid a finger in and out then he slid two fingers in fucked me with his fingers for a bit before he started rubbing my clit again. I orgasmed and was really loud when I did I then grabbed his pants took it off and started sucking cock he was moaning a lot so I sucked more and harder.

He pulled his cock out and took my hand pulled me up and led me to his bedroom, he da t me down on the bed spread my legs open licked me a bit before I pulled him on the bed lay him down sucked his cock a bit more then climbed on him I slid down on his cock and rode him for a bit as he was squeezing my butt, he then told me to turn around so he can see my ass as I ride him. I did until he came inside me. 

We lay there for a bit before chatting before we started making out again and he fucked me doggy style and missionary. ",1,1743164379.0,cheating_stories,0,1.0,False

She tried a long time ago but wasn’t accepted, so she became an ophthalmologist. This is her academic background:

Bachelor’s degree in phonoaudiology, a master’s in speech-language pathology, and she started a doctorate in speech language but didn’t finish. She published a few articles, wrote a chapter of a published book and a few other accomplishments. 

Her professional background:

Worked as a speech therapist for 15, 3 of those she was a professor at college and during the other 12 she worked in a clinic until she became the owner. Then she became an entrepreneur and opened a business (coffee shop and restaurant), got a few awards, and sold it 8 years later. Then, in the last 5 years, she is started working as a financial advisor for medical clinics. In all of these fields she was very successful. 

It has always been her dream to become a physician, so I want to know realistically how hard it will be for her if she tries.

I’m 38 F. I’ve been calorie counting and exercising regularly since March 2024.

I was diagnosed with T2D in March 2022. I’ve been on instant and slow release metformin. Several other diabetic medications and nothing was helping. 

I was started on mounjaro in August 2024. I’ve been on 10mg since November or December of 2024. 

I’ve been on Elvanse for my ADHD since January 2025. 

I’ve always had the effect of loose stool and regular (ie several times a day) 💩 and therefore as annoying as they could be, it wasn’t an issue. 

I had my injection on Thursday last week. I then did not poop for 5 days. 

I’ve had Senna, Duculax, and then movicol. Movicol finally got me moving.

However I have yet to feel emptied. It’s only been a bit. I do drink plenty of water anyway and have a high fibre diet (around 25/30g per day)

I walk every day. So I get movement. 

Add to that I’m bloated. Severely. I’ve gained 3kg on scales in a week due to water retention and stools still in my colon. 

I took my MJ yesterday. I’ve stayed off my ADHD meds since Sunday past and I’m still unable to fully empty. 

I’ve stopped the movicol as I feel this is what is making the water retention worse. The only thing making me go even slightly is coffee. However I’m just not emptying and I’ve got trapped wind and all sorts now. 

Anyone else had this or similar and can share what else I can try.

Plus I added I know he doesn't have any answers for me; and that I think it would be easier for him to live on if he just saw my calm face. Also prompted him when will we grab a coffee, go on a walk, go with motorcycles around and so on. Because we both have another 40 years to live happily. 

And guess what, he texted back.

>Hey FluffyKita, I don’t understand your inconsistency, since some of your messages were very hostile. Because of that, I got the feeling that if you’re holding such strong resentment, there’s no point in us having any kind of contact. 

>Even though you know that from the beginning I wanted a normal relationship. If you’re ready for normal communication, I have no problem with that.

What do you think? I don't know what I want from him at this point it is too late for everything and anything. If someone asks me, why I even texted him, I have no clue. I don't even hate him. I don't love him. I currently have no desire to write him back. But yeah, his reply is classic DA one lol. I assume text he sent was written with a help of GPT, just like the break-up one was.

Mind you, he blindsided me early in December and been mostly ghosting me from then on. He monkey-branched or tried to, what is going on with him I have no idea, but I know he completely abandonded his IG account where we communicated. 

I just want piece and closure and stop this clown shitshow for good. We are almost neighbours and it is a question of time when we bump at eachother. I guess I wanted to let him know or let him know I kind of understand his state of things, but at the same time do not want to tell him directly I don't want to be with him anymore ever again because he doesn't have the capabilities for a relationship. Oh yes, this I wrote him in that ""hostile"" email lmao. 

Oh dear God, what have I got myself into. I wish our relationship didn't happen fr.

Now we're living in a house that runs on tank water. Couple days ago after I woke up I was washing my face in the bathroom, I turned the tab full, I was still washing my face that my husband walked in and changed it to a quarter and said we need to save water. And asked me if I want to see the tank to know how much water we have. At first I said no but he asked again and I said yes. I thought that was it. But when we moved to the bedroom he started throwing all these questions at me, that why don't you think saving water is not important? Why don't you want to save water and so on. It bothers me when he keeps repeating himself & I felt I was pushed into a corner, I didn't have the energy to deal with it so I told him for fuck's sake I just woke up and haven't had my coffee yet. Ever since that comment the whole thing turned into an argument and still is going on. I apologized to him again and again but seems like whatever I do or I say is not good enough. Last time we had an argument and again I apologized for ignoring him but he still was going on about it until I said there's no winning with you, and even today he still tells me why are you talking about winning? I started writing cute notes and hiding them for him, things like, I love you, I can see myself growing old with you, I love your smile and he told me that's just a surface level, there's nothing deep about him.

1jltjrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1jltjrr/please_help_a_newbie_out_with_channeling_i_tried/,Please help a newbie out with channeling- I tried (almost) everything,"Hello, I've recently upgraded to a flair 58 from the pro 2 and I am encountering channeling issues. When extracting, my bottomless portafilter looks like giraffe patches and has some very occasional tiny spurts.

Setup: Flair 58, Eureka Mignon Notte/Manuale, VST 15g basket, Normcore self-levelling tamper, standard WDT tool.

My routine/recipe:

1. 16g dose of coffee (because I read that VST baskets allow for 1g+- variance)- my usual dose coming from flair pro 2.
2. RDT and mixing around with a teaspoon to distribute the droplets
3. WDT starting from the bottom of the basket and working my way up
4. Knock the portafilter once or twice to settle the grounds then tamping twice firmly with normcore v4 self-levelling tamper

I have tried:

\- to purge my grinder with 6g of coffee every time I change a grind setting  
\- grind much coarser, channeling is still the same if not worse  
\- not to RDT because I thought that the water might cause clumping to no avail  
\- to tamp with less force (not sure how relevant this is as I've seen many people have conflicting takes on whether this matters)  
\- to use blind shaker without wdt and then tamp to no avail  
\- pre-infusion for about 10-15s to no avail (the pre-infusion stage looks normal until I ramp up the pressure)  
\- to use the stock flair basket and for some reason the channeling is 2X worse  
\- wetting the puck screen first and trying a different puck screen (normcore 0.8mm) to no avail  
\- to use 15g dosage to match the 15g VST basket with a much finer grind setting (which has shown only very minor improvements)

At this point what else am I missing? I'm starting to get a bit frustrated because I've wasted a lot of coffee at this point and while I love the workflow of the 58 I'm really starting to regret the upgrade. Though its not the end of the world as the coffee is still drinkable but with very obvious hints of overextraction and astringency. I'm starting to think its a problem with the grinder but it doesn't make much sense since this grinder is only 1 month old. The only thing left I can think of is to manually open up the grinder and re-aligning the burrs but I'm a rookie and there will be a huge risk of me not knowing what I'm doing and making the grinder worse than it is now.

# Retrocausality

**Classification**: Supernatural Powers, Conceptual Powers, Cognitive Powers

**Type**: Thought-Based

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 1

**Summary**:

What happened when a young god got bored with the boring concept of cause and effect? Well, he will naturally try to change it for his own amusement.

When Saiki was only 4 years old he already understood every concept of the universe and tried to change them so that he could have some fun, thus **Retrocausality** was born.

The power to reverse the cause so that it arises from the effect, the cause is a mere formality, for the effect has already occurred before it even originates. This power alters everyone's mind so that this seems normal to them.

1jltcp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1jltcp2/quitting_is_so_much_easier_than_i_thought/,Quitting is so much easier than I thought,"Reading everyone’s stories on here is what motivated me to quit this week. I am currently on Day 4 of quitting cold turkey after using nicotine in multiple forms for the better part of 10 years. Most recently Zyns for the last 3 years. 

There’s so much I could say but the first thing is thank you to everyone who posted their own story here because I have been lurking and reading every post to gain the motivation to quit. I always knew I was going to have to quit eventually and the deciding factor to make it be this week where it all ended was all the people saying how much better they felt several weeks and months without it. 

I wish I could blink and have a few months of being nicotine free under my belt but I know I will get there eventually. 

As someone going through withdrawals this very week, I just want to reassure anyone out there reading this who is thinking of quitting, understand that it is not as bad as what A) other people might have told you and B) not as bad as your brain is telling you it will be. 

How I would describe what has happened to me is basically a long, dull migraine, that flares up with more concentrated pain (only for about 10 minutes) all the times I would have normally had one in. Like after drinking coffee, eating breakfast/lunch/dinner, before bed, etc. 

Trust me when I say you can do it. The headaches are manageable, I promise you. The insomnia makes sense, talk yourself through it. Your nervous system is resetting. It will take a bit of time to get back to normal, but you will get there. I have been using melatonin and a long hot shower before bed and I am waking up several times throughout the night which is to be expected. It’s not fun but it’s certainly manageable and it won’t last forever. 

I put it off for so long because I was convinced I couldn’t quit. I felt so alone. I needed it, I had to have it no matter what. 

I realize now that my brain lied to me. I don’t actually need it, and I feel just about a million times better now that I have several days under my belt. If I can do it, someone with the most addictive personality in the world, you can too. Day 4 is looking great. No big cravings yet today and the headache subsided when I woke up. Make it through 72 hours, you can do it! 

I took everyone else’s advice. Here’s what helped me:
-Water. Drink some all day long. 
-Exercise. I have been hitting the gym HARD everyday. It helps with the headaches. You gotta sweat this stuff out and also I’m eating more so I mean I have to get good workouts in so I don’t gain 10 lbs.
-Lots of gum
-Wintergreen lifesavers 
-Sugarfree carmels
-Lemon mint ricola sugar free cough drops (don’t sleep on these they really help when you need to feel a little numbness in your mouth) 
-toothpicks

[Chinese Agency Admits Rare Earth Metals Rule May End](https://agmetalminer.com/2025/03/27/china-rare-earth-metals-rule-may-end/)

https://preview.redd.it/420r7fam1fre1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=16e4f3a859d2a9cf9ff9e3551c75e49911d68d6c

A rare earth metals report by none other than a state-backed research institute is not only likely to unsettle the Chinese authorities, it has also come as a bolt out of the blue for the rest of the world. A report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences released a few days ago said China’s dominance in the rare earths sector could be nearing the end.

But the disclosure does not stop there. It also outlines how the opening of new mines in Australia, South Africa and other countries, as well as Greenland’s Kvanefjeld project, may reshape the rare earths ecosystem in the coming years. This also serves to underline why the U.S. under President Donald Trump is so keen on Greenland. With the publication of this report, some experts believe that the changing scenario will favor the United States.

# A Shock for the Rare Earth Metals Market

The study, which was published in the [Chinese Rare Earths journal](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3303167/chinas-rare-earth-dominance-could-crumble-10-years-cas-study-forecasts), is a rare admission of a forthcoming fundamental shift. The CAS team used advanced “agent-based” modeling to simulate demand and mining prospects globally between 2025 and 2040. Though this accurately simulated about 1,000 global deposits and over 140 viable mines, it did not factor in political influences.

[Credit: corlaffra](https://preview.redd.it/l3l6pyyo1fre1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=efaee6ae8b8127d955c0da47ccf2c0b00d3cbb97)

Based on the results, the research team concluded that China’s roughly 62% share of raw material could drop to about 28% as early as 2035. The primary reasoning is the new emerging sources of rare earth metals. Incidentally, the research team is from the CAS Ganjiang Innovation Academy in Ganzhou in eastern China, one of the world’s largest critical metal production centers.  

Today, China’s dominance of the supply chain for rare earths and other critical metals is near-total. The country sits on about 60% of global reserves and processes about 90% of all rare earth metals. Because of this, Beijing enjoys a near-monopoly in the supply of rare earth materials, which are essential for electric vehicles, electronics and even military equipment.

# The United States, Africa, and Other Global Players

Since China produces about 2/3rd of the world’s total rare earth metals supply, the U.S. has been on the lookout for [alternatives](https://agmetalminer.com/2025/03/06/rare-earths-mmi-ukrainian-deal/). A 2024 report by the United States Geological Survey said there were about 110 MT of deposits spread around the world. Of this, about 44 MT are in China, another 22 MT are in Brazil, followed by 21 MT in Vietnam, 10 MT in Russia and approximately 7 MT in India.  

Now, it seems that Africa may also become a big player in the rare earth supply chain. Led by South Africa’s Steenkampskraal mine and other projects in Tanzania, experts predict Africa’s share may go up to from about 1% to 7% by 2040. But there is a red flag to consider, as Chinese investments fund many of the African projects, something the U.S. looks at with consternation.

https://preview.redd.it/y3u3cbfs1fre1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdf4f8f24db5fad8cbd91c0671c2cf43f3428228

The report also stated that Brazil’s Serra Verde and other projects related to heavy rare earths like dysprosium could meet about 13% of the global supply by 2040. However, there are caveats, such as environmental regulations. The CAS report adds that the neodymium-rich Mount Weld mine in Australia and the Olympic Dam mines, which produce copper and uranium as byproducts, are building U.S.-allied refining networks to bypass China. 

# New Discoveries by China and the U.S.

In January of this year, Beijing disclosed it had found a huge rare earth deposit in the southwestern province of Yunnan. According to reports quoting China’s Geological Survey, the 1.5 million ton [deposit](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3295217/discovery-massive-rare-earth-deposit-yunnan-boost-china) contains medium and heavy rare earths, including over 470,000 tons of elements like praseodymium and neodymium. At the time of the announcement, experts said that the discovery would only further consolidate China’s prominence as the global rare earth leader.

On the opposite side of the world, U.S. researchers announced in late 2024 that they had identified a domestic treasure trove of [critical minerals](https://www.sustainability-times.com/environmental-protection/8-4-billion-treasure-unveiled-in-us-coal-ash-these-rare-earths-could-shatter-chinas-hold/) in the country’s coal ash deposits. The report also claimed that coal ash, a byproduct from burning coal for energy typically written off as industrial waste, could hold about 11 MT of rare earth elements, or about eight times more than known domestic rare earth reserves.

This discovery, made by a team from [The University of Texas at Austin](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40789-024-00710-z), reveals a whopping US $8.4 billion worth of rare earths. The report led some experts to opine that harnessing these reserves could dramatically alter the supply chain dynamics for rare earth metals and reduce U.S. dependence on imports.

# MARCH 27th, 2025~New Executive Order regarding Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production

[New Executive Order regarding Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production | White & Case LLP](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/new-executive-order-regarding-immediate-measures-increase-american-mineral-production)

**The mineral production Executive Order focuses on increasing funding and decreasing regulatory hurdles for mining and critical mineral projects in the United States.**

# The Executive Order

On March 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order regarding Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production, aimed at facilitating increased production of critical minerals on an accelerated timeline. The Executive Order calls upon multiple agencies (including the Department of Defense (DOD) and its Office of Strategic Capital (OSC), Department of the Interior (DOI), Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Energy (DOE), United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Export-Import Bank (EXIM) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), among others) to support new development and improvement of critical minerals production. Relatedly, the Executive Order expands the definition of “critical minerals” so that for the purposes of the actions mandated by this Executive Order, all relevant lists now include uranium, copper, potash, gold and any other element, compound, or material as determined by the Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC), formed by Executive Order of February 14, 2025.

# Immediate Action on New Development

The Executive Order sets forth a series of rapid deadlines through the next few weeks, requiring various federal agencies to take specific actions to aid domestic mining and minerals projects as follows:

The designated agencies must provide a list of all mineral production projects for which a plan of operations, a permit application, or other application for approval has been submitted (by **March 30, 2025**)  and identify priority projects for immediate approval / permit issuance; take all necessary or appropriate actions to expedite and issue the relevant permits and approvals (by **April 9, 2025**).

The Chair of the NEDC must (in consultation with relevant agency heads) submit to the Executive Director of the Permitting Council mineral production projects to be considered as “transparency projects” on the Permitting Dashboard established under the FAST Act of 2020 (by **April 4, 2025**). Within 15 days of receiving a submission, the Executive Director of the Permitting Council must publish any projects selected and establish schedules for expedited review. The NEDC must also solicit feedback from industry participants on regulatory bottlenecks and strategies for exploiting domestic mineral production.

Secretary of the Interior must prepare a list of all Federal lands known to hold critical mineral deposits and reserves and provide such list to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (by **March 30, 2025**).

The DOD, DOI, USDA and DOE must identify as many sites as possible on Federal land managed by their respective agencies that may be suitable for leasing or development of private commercial critical mineral production enterprises, and provide such list to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Chair of the NEDC, prioritizing sites which could be operational quickly and have greatest impact on domestic critical mineral supply chain (by April 19, 2025) and thereafter the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy must execute extended use leases with private entities developing commercial critical mineral production enterprises on the Federal lands identified on the list referred to above.

The Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the SBA must coordinate with each other and the head of any other agency providing loans, capital assistance, technical assistance and working capital to domestic critical mineral production project sponsors, to ensure that all private parties who enter into lease and commercial agreements pursuant to this Executive Order can utilize as many favorable terms and conditions as are available (by **April 19, 2025**).

The President of EXIM must release recommended program guidance for the use of mineral and mineral production financing tools authorized under the Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative and Make More in America Initiatives (by **April 19, 2025**).

The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy must convene meetings with buyers of minerals and work towards an announced request for bids to supply such minerals, and the DOD must further add mineral production as a priority industrial capability development area for the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment Program (assessing supply chain vulnerabilities and investing in production of targeted products) (by **April 19, 2025**).

The DOD, OSC and DFC must develop and propose a plan for the DFC to use DOD investment authorities, including the Defense Production Act (DPA) (under the delegated authority detailed below) and the OSC to establish a dedicated mineral and mineral production fund for domestic investments executed by DFC (by **April 19, 2025**). The plan must be approved by the Secretary of Defense, the CEO of DFC and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The Secretary of Defense will transfer appropriated DPA or Office of Strategic Capital funds to the DFC to reimburse DFC for its implementation services. 

The Administrator of the SBA must prepare and submit to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy recommendations for legislation to enhance private-public capital activities to support financings to domestic small businesses engaged in mineral production (by **May 4, 2025**).

# Accelerating Investment under Emergency Powers

In furtherance of the above-listed actions, and pursuant to the national energy emergency declared under Executive Order 14156 (Declaring a National Energy Emergency), this new Executive Order delegates DPA authority to the Secretary of Defense (in consultation with other agency heads) and waives certain limitations on the Secretary of Defense’s use of the DPA to facilitate mineral production. This allows the Secretary of Defense to make available subsidy payments for domestic mineral production, procure and install additional equipment and facilities for domestic mineral production, and provide for the modification or expansion of privately owned mineral production facilities.

The Secretary of Defense is further directed to utilize the National Security Capital Forum to pair private capital with commercially viable domestic mineral production projects to the maximum extent possible, and all agencies with funding authority for mineral projects must rescind all policies that require applicants to submit Regulation S-K 1300 disclosures as part of their applications.

# Removing Obstacles, Multiplying Incentives:

This Executive Order sweeps through the existing regulatory landscape for domestic mining and mineral production with a clear goal: to maximize participation by private capital and minimize any obstacles or requirements that may delay or deter developers from seeking to undertake projects of this nature. By lowering the “red tape” cost of critical mineral project development and increasing the availability of low-interest Federal capital, the Trump Administration seeks to lower barriers to entry for new players in the domestic minerals space while also rewarding existing players for increasing their investment in the United States. There are many potential US mining projects currently awaiting permitting issuances and approvals that may benefit from this initial period of intense inter-agency coordination, including (for example) Polymet Mining’s NorthMet copper-nickel mine in Minnesota, Perpetua Resources’ Stibnite gold and antimony mine in Idaho, and the Twin Metals copper, nickel and cobalt mine in Minnesota. The Stibnite and Twin Metals projects are both located on United States Forest Service-owned land, and various other projects (e.g., the Copper World project in Arizona) abut federal land and may seek to expand onto such land in the near future.

The deadlines to identify and fast-track the permitting of mineral production projects for which permit applications and operational plans have already been submitted will work to clear the decks at each of these Federal agencies, likely with a view to clearing up bandwidth to assess a hoped-for flood of new project proposals over the coming months.

It is important to note that Executive Order 14154 (Unleashing American Energy) ordered the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to rescind all NEPA regulations it has promulgated. While mining entities will still need to obtain permits, comply with NEPA regulations issued by other Federal agencies, and comply with NEPA itself, CEQ’s previous guidance and regulations have been removed, and Federal agencies have been ordered to revise their NEPA regulations to prioritize permitting speed and the removal of permitting obstacles. Projects seeking Federal funding under this new framework will, therefore, still need to understand and comply with requirements for environmental surveys and reporting obligations but may find a reduction in the needed level of analysis and reporting with respect thereto.

The Executive Order also directs the Federal government to prioritize critical mineral production on Federal lands known to hold mineral deposits and reserves. The relevant agencies collectively own or manage over 27% of land in the United States, which may now be open to critical mineral exploration and production. This will be advantageous to new entrants targeting extraction in areas previously off-limits and also to projects adjacent to Federal lands, which may now consider expansion previously thought not feasible.

Finally, we note that, although the definition of “critical minerals” set forth in 30 U.S.C. 1606 specifically excludes fuel minerals and limits “critical minerals” to those designated as critical by the Secretary of the Interior, in addition to the explicit expansion to include uranium, copper, potash and gold as “critical minerals,” the Executive Order authorizes the NEDC to designate any other element, compound or material as a “critical mineral” **for purposes of the Executive Order**. Considering the mandate of the NEDC, which includes increasing production of coal and petroleum products, the NEDC could in the future potentially also designate fuel minerals, such as coal, oil and natural gas as critical minerals for purposes of benefiting from the incentives contemplated in the Executive Order.

Although these actions signal the Trump Administration’s solutions for an American economy less dependent on imported mineral resources, unless these changes are eventually picked up in legislation passed by Congress, industry participants must balance capitalizing on the opportunity afforded by these new incentive programs with a clear-eyed view across multiple administrations. Executive Orders can be signed in an afternoon, but a mining project will be under construction for years, and in operation for decades. Nonetheless, the existing programs and related enabling laws for many of the relevant agencies already included work on critical mineral supply (with availability in the existing programs of the DOE’s Loan Programs Office, DFC’s and EXIM’s lending and guarantee programs and in the OSC) and this Executive Order is likely to both encourage such agencies to prioritize such projects and to provide enabling support through accelerated permitting where available.

(OPENS UP & BUILDS UPON WHAT WAS STARTED & TIES IN NICELY WITH RESPONSES FROM NIOCORP!)

**\*\*\*\*\*REMINDS ME OF JIMS EARLIER RESPONSES TO DOD & ""OTHER ENTITIES"".... SEEMS LIKE MOMENTUM IS BUILDING INTO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FOR CM'S! Hoping & thinking Niocorp's time is due!**

ON MARCH 17th Jim Sims Responded:

**Given:** NioCorp management has been in discussions with the previous administration & now the new Trump administration. I've gotta ask-

 Given: [Exclusive: Trump seeks minerals refining on Pentagon bases to boost US output, sources say | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-seeks-minerals-refining-pentagon-bases-boost-us-output-sources-say-2025-03-10/)

 *""Trump aims to build metals refining facilities on Pentagon military bases as part of his plan to boost domestic production of critical minerals.""*  

*1) How does NioCorp intend to proceed forward with their ""New"" proprietary separation process moving forward given this comment above & having been in recent talks with the new administration?  Given: NioCorp will not be producing a ""Concentrate"" of CM's but has developed it's very own (in-house) new proprietary method to separate* ***(all CM's i.e. Niobium, Scandium, Titanium & REE's plus byproducts & possible Magnet Recycling)*** *at the eventual Elk Creek Mine site should financing occur? Please comment Jim:*

**RESPONSE:**

#   ""No change to our plan to process our critical minerals at our site in Nebraska, as we are fully permitted to move to construction and maintain excellent relationships with area landowners.  POTUS’ innovative proposal about processing minerals on military bases is more geared to projects that have difficulty obtaining permits to site these facilities, particularly for mines located on federal lands.  Our project is entirely located on all private lands, which is why we are one of the most shovel-ready greenfield projects in the U.S.""

2)*\*\*\*Are several entities such as (DoD, U.S. & Allied Governments & Private Industries) “STILL” Interested securing Off-take Agreements for NioCorp's remaining Critical Minerals (Titanium, Niobium 25%, Rare Earths, CaCO3, MgCO3 & some Iron stuff* ***in 2025?****) - Should Financing be secured??* 

**RESPONSE:**

# MARCH 25th, 2025 ~With Rare Earths In Trump’s Fast Lane, Wyoming Projects Get Cash Infusions

***As the Trump administration continues to put domestic development of rare earth mining and processing in the fast lane, Wyoming’s big projects benefit. The push means huge infusions of cash to develop them.***

[Rare Element Resources has already started operations at its rare earths demonstration plant in Upton, Wyoming. \(Courtesy Rare Element Resources\)](https://preview.redd.it/cnlt3vyj2fre1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=64f6767a23f3f9e31225a176d73ab6994526909d)

A pair of Wyoming ventures developing two different types of rare earth processing recently provided details about capital investment attached to each project. The news arrived as part of a marketing wave pushed out by rare earth mining companies pitching themselves to investors.

This week, Wyoming's Bear Lodge rare earth mining and refining project announced $553 million in debt financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM).

The Export-Import Bank was one of the agencies named in President Donald Trump's March 20 executive order directing federal agencies to expedite permitting and funding for critical minerals. 

""We appreciate this EXIM expression of interest and view it as further legitimization of our significant efforts to date as well as our plan for the future of our Bear Lodge Project,"" stated Ken Mushinski, president and CEO of Rare Element Resources, in a March 20 statement. 

RER’s processing and separation demonstration plant “is a timely and necessary step,” according to the statement, in the company’s move toward refining ore into marketable quantities of rare earth minerals.

# Project Outside Sheridan

At the Ramaco Resources facility near Ranchester, the company is leveraging a $6.1 million matching grant from the Wyoming Energy Authority to develop a resource stream of rare earth and critical minerals from coal deposits. 

“The interesting thing is our deposit is frankly contained in mineralized portions of coal,” Randall Atkins, chairman and CEO of Ramaco Resources, told Cowboy State Daily from company headquarters in Lexington, Kentucky, on Tuesday. 

Atkins agreed that Wyoming is well positioned to serve the growing demand for rare earth minerals, given it has two processing facilities in the works. 

Ramaco brings another advantage, said Atkins.

“A lot of these other companies have mining claims that they basically don't actually own the property, nor are they actually permitted to mine,” said Atkins. “There's a lot of time and a lot of money that has to go into it before they're in the same position that we're in.”

As Atkins sees the marketplace unfolding, he predicted Ramaco’s 15,800-acre Brook Mine, “Would probably end up selling some of our production to perhaps the Defense Department or various Defense Department related contractors who already are using rare earths that are being procured from foreign sources. We have become a domestic source of supply for those.”

**Other Players In The Space**

In Colorado, USA Rare Earth recently said it reached a significant milestone in its Texas Round Top mine project by successfully producing a sample of dysprosium oxide with a purity of 99.1%.

Dysprosium oxide enhances neodymium-based permanent magnets, improving their resistance to demagnetization at high temperatures, which is crucial for wind turbines and electric vehicles, according to company materials.

There’s also news of rare earth exploration around coal mines around the towns of Rangely and Delta.

Outside Salmon, Idaho, the rare earth element Thorium is found in abundance on nearby public lands. Thorium strengthens magnesium alloys and tungsten filaments in incandescent bulbs and welding electrodes, and Idaho Strategic Resources is exploring deposits to the east and west of Salmon.

In Montana, on U.S. Forest Service land near Sheep Creek in Ravalli County,  U.S. Critical Materials said it recently identified deposits of lanthanum, neodymium, and praseodymium. 

Marketing materials for the company calls it a ""geological unicorn"" due to the exceptionally high concentrations. 

Then there’s Utah. A University of Utah team found rare earth deposits last year in active coal mines rimming the Uinta coal belt in the Book Cliffs. 

# The Wyoming Edge? 

Amid the current hype coming from mining companies looking for investment in rare earth projects, the state of Wyoming is mentioned.

On March 13, the company American Rare Earths touted the edge it said it’s gained by doing business in Wyoming. 

Melissa Sanderson, the non-executive director at American Rare Earths and co-chair of the [Critical Minerals Institute](https://criticalmineralsinstitute.com/) (CMI), said Wyoming is, “One of the few American states that gained complete control over the mining permitting process.”

In an interview with [InvestorNews.com](http://InvestorNews.com), Sanderson said the Halleck Creek Project near Wheatland has an advantage because operating solely on Wyoming state lands accelerates the permitting process as American Rare Earths develops what Sanderson described as, “a large size consistent grade asset.” 

“This makes us the best positioned rare earth resource in America to come to market,” claimed Sanderson.

Joe Evers, president of Wyoming Rare USA, agrees. 

Wyoming Rare USA is the subsidiary of American Rare Earths that's developing the Halleck Creek Project near Wheatland. 

Evers, who grew up in Sheridan, said the state and industry pulling together to develop rare earth mining, “Is a recognition that there is an urgent need for these critical materials.""

""It is just a collective recognition that we are at a point in time where we have to solve this and we have the resources, the tools and the ability to do it.”

**May 20**

I am in the back today.  Lemar is a manager and in his element.  Jackie is his shift supervisor today.  We have 4 people working the counter with them and it is busy as fuck.  I check every now and then to make sure they are okay.  I only have to help twice in 2 hours. The rest of my time is spent in my cave. I am mostly going over books and trying to make sure the finances will work out for this. 

I am confident I can buy the property outright and stop having to rent.  The franchise has a 20-year lease, but that isn’t safe.  It would mean I don’t have to worry about fickle landlords. It would mean this is truly MY place.  It means I can make sure every client can get in comfortably.  It also means I can protect Connie better. I don’t know why, but I want… no, I NEED all that.  I NEED this place to be truly mine or close enough that no one can question it.

A knock on my door pulls me up from my work.  It looks like a paper factory was sucked up in a tornado.  But I have a system, so I don’t care.  “Come in.”

An elegant business suit and a smile that never quite puts you at ease greets me.  Mab has her “elixir” in her hand and walks in.  “Going for the paper mill in a hurricane aesthetic?”

“Funny.  Close, though. What may I assist you with, valued customer?”

“Knock it off, I am here as a friend. The inferno of passion trapped in a human body is so worried about what has you so preoccupied over the last few days that her broadcasting is almost giving me a headache.”

“Tell Jackie I am fine.”

Mab laughs and begins looking at my paperwork.  Her mind is as alien as it can get and she thinks far too quickly when she isn’t playing human, so by the time she has made her way to me, she is nodding her head.  “Bold plan in this market.  Luckily, you have new clients that pay in strange things like antiquities and silver.  You should be able to pull it as long as your tips remain consistent.  Of course, that means earning tips, which means we get to see you and not have you sequestered in a dark room like a goblin.”

I shake my head.  “I am having problems converting the gold.  I can’t flood the market. I am going to have to ask for mortal coin soon.”

Mab looks at me with distress.  “Are our ways causing your business harm?”  I smile at her and touch her arm in thanks.

“YOU and several of your kin have always provided us with normal coin and sometimes actual gold ones.  Those have been a blessing to us in ways you likely do not see.  You have not once caused me harm.  We have a big family, and I want to make sure they can all be here, feel welcome, and we are compensated, so I have allowed things to slide.  I can’t keep doing the back-end things and afford to buy this place though.  The value of the items is being diminished by them being circulated in these quantities.  The local shops will be flooded, and my one international trading house is my favorite place to convert these exotic coins and items.  Hell, that place likes us so much they are moving in next door!”  I don’t think that is true, but it is a hilarious coincidence, so I am making the joke.

Mab laughs at that. She then takes a long pull of her elixir.  “You have good instincts. I value that. Let me talk to a business lawyer I know.  He may be able to come up with something.”

I desperately want to ask her to do so, but I can’t.  “You know I can’t ask you to do that.”

“I said I would talk to him.  You’d have to pay him and he would help you, not me.  If I happen to mention you are looking for a way to do this, and he thinks of one, that’s not a favor.  Just conversation.”

I narrow my eyes at her.  “That’s stretching the definitions enough to make a rubber band jealous.”  She laughs.   

She moves in behind me as I sit and whispers in my ear.  “For a friend, I would stretch many MANY ways.”  Her breath is both cold and hot against my neck. Her smell is delicate, and every fiber of my being is immediately wanting to find out how far she would stretch.  *So maybe I am pansexual and Fae Queens get my motor running?  I mean, all I gotta do is* ***DERAIL!!***

“Darling, do you HAVE to yell derail in your mind every time your train of thought starts becoming juicy?”

They can hear me thinking that?!  “You heard that?”

She licks her lips and nods.  Her eyes gleam of mischief and promised pleasure.  *Oh, gods below, she looks so predatory and so inviting…*

There is a clatter outside.  Someone dropped something.  Luckily it helps my brain to decide at that moment that it needs a reboot.  She has never once flirted or shown any interest in me and now Fae Queen Mab of the Winter Court, the Queen of Air and Darkness just made some of the most lascivious series of comments I can imagine in this moment.  *WHY IS SHE SO CLOSE AND SMELLS SO GOOD?*   *Is the room sound proofed?  It may not be enough if she doesn’t move soon. You can still hear all this, can’t you?*

As she is again nodding and flicking her tongue out to gently touch my ear, I hear a knock on my door.  Jacob opens it.  “Hey boss, shift supervisor says we are getting low on oat milk up front.  We have enough for maybe the rest of the day.  She slipped and dropped a container.” 

I nod and turn, I am face to face with Mab, she is smiling sweetly.  She tilts her head a little and half closes her eyes.  I am still trying to process this entire thing.  I turn back to Jacob.  “I will get us some.”  *Why did I never notice how beautiful she is? How would her lips feel like if I bit them…*

Mab suddenly shudders and then straightens up.  She looked at the door.  “I should stop bothering you, for both our sakes.  I do enjoy our time together.  I will talk to my friend about you.  He’s already heard quite a bit, so he may be happy to help.”

Wait, she talks about me to people?  I shake myself a bit.  *Come on Pat, get it together, you see incredibly beautiful women all the time.  Hell, you live with one that gives almost all of these Fae a run for their money.*

I go out to make a run. Wow, the lobby is warm today, better see if the thermostat is working. I go to do so and the AC kicks in. Okay, that's good.  Fastest way to get that oat milk is to use the car to get it.  Jackie is smiling sheepishly and waves to me.  She is such a klutz sometimes.

I don’t use the company car for anything but supply runs or the occasional employee pick up.  I hate driving in New York City.  But this is important.  I need to get some other items as well.  Time for grocery store run.

I walk in and grab a basket and begin looking at the list on my phone.  Just after getting some cleaning supplies, I get a phone call.  It is a local number, so I figure it is unlikely to be a scammer.  They always have other states for it.

“Hello?” 

“Hello there, this is Pat Wallace, correct?”  The voice sounds familiar.  Regular.  Drive through?

I know better than to agree to that without some context.  “I am at a disadvantage as I do not know how you got this number, nor who you are.  You will understand if I don’t just tell you my name.”

He laughs and responds, “Maybelle told me you would be cautious as you didn’t initiate this.  She even wished me good luck getting you to confirm your name. Right on the money, as usual.  She is a friend of mine.  I am William Fredericks, a business law lawyer, and I specialize in small businesses.  She told me you want to buy your building and do some upgrades and repairs along with having a little extra for maintenance.  She gave me some of your numbers and I am intrigued.  Is it okay if I text you a number?  It is our administrative assistant, Gretchen.  She can schedule a meeting for us to go over some numbers.”

“Sure.  I assume we can also go over your rates as well.”  I will remember to call Mab by the mortal name Maybelle in front of her sometime. Impeccable suit, modern aesthetic and answers to Maybelle?  Heh.

“He chuckles.  I assure you that it will be a reasonable fee for you.  Maybelle told me about your business and I use the drive through almost every weekday.  Hell, I got my oatmilk cortado in my hand.”

“Varying shades of grey suits, blue tie every Tuesday, Red on Friday, rotating colors on other days?  Cortado most days and experimenting with the dark roast.”

He doesn’t respond for a long few seconds.  “Maybelle was not joking.  Wow.  How?”

I chuckle a bit.  “I have a weird memory for customers and their drinks.  Yes, it scares me too.  I have sort of leaned into it.  Okay, you check out.  But what about this caused you to decide to call?”

He chuckles and takes a second to respond.  “Maybelle and I have worked on deals for close to 30 years.  The first 5 she scared me a little but she was so good to me I couldn’t help but call her my friend.  She is part of my family, more or less, at this point.  In the last 2 years she has become much happier.  She smiles more, and she talks about her favorite coffee shop and her favorite people.  She talks about you like some people talk about family.  Which sort of makes you my family now. Anyone that can get her to open up like that is special.  And she says you are special. She is rarely wrong. She told me that with a little help you can soar.  I want to see how far you can fly.”

“I look forward to seeing that with you as well. I will wait for that text.”  Shopping done, I pay with the company card and head out to the car when I see a mermaid irregular.  I wave.  She waves.  She’s wearing a loose hoodie and baggy jeans.  It seems to be her favorite look. 

“Hi Pat!” She says to me, and I smile. My mind goes over her order and hits her name.  I chuckle.

“Hi Pat!” I say back.  She gives me a fist bump and we talk while I walk to the car.  I put the supplies in the trunk.  And look at her.  She really is pretty.  And she is a complete sweetheart.  She’s also so androgynous that I wasn’t sure she wasn’t a slim guy the first time we met. 

“I’d love to stay and talk but there are perishables in there and I need to get these to the shop.”

She nods.  “I am just waiting on the bus.  I’ll be swinging by before work. Have a safe drive.”

I stare at her.  “Seriously?  Just going to take the bus when I am going there now?”

“I would not ask a favor of you for a car ride.  Though I trust you would not abuse it.”  She looks a little sad.

“I will exchange a ride for conversation on the way to my place of business.”  I wink at her.

She looks very torn.  Eventually, she nods.  Something is bothering her.  She asks if it is okay to vape in the car, I ask her to lower the window and she nods and damn near hugs me.

On the car ride over she has several pulls of the vape.  I notice her voice seems to be deeper and she nods.  “Vape always hurts my throat.”

“You shouldn’t do something that hurts your body if you can avoid it.  GAH!!  I SOUND LIKE MY MOTHER!!!”  I shake my head at my overbearing comment.  “Sorry.”

Pat laughs, voice deepened by the vape.  “More like a big sister.  Heh.  You are fine.” 

We chit chat and it is a fun ride.  Pat gets out and we walk back to the store.  Looking around Pat see’s a bunch of bankers talking around a table and she seems elated.  One or two look our way.  Pat is very pretty, so I get it.  “Alright, gotta go make a call, later.”  I wave to everyone and go schedule a meeting.

Pat says goodbye and I notice her voice got better.  Fae magic, I tell ya.

Todd is in the lobby today.  I get in a half hour early and see him playing on his laptop while drinking and eating a danish.  As I walk in, he nods and keeps doing his thing.  I walk up to him and see him playing some game.  It looks a little familiar, so I watch as he is fighting 2 enemies that are obviously other people controlling their characters and he attempts to run.  They chase him, into 2 of his teammates and he and the reinforcements proceed to murder the two enemies.  They move to a spot, and he giggles.  “Okay, so 4 on 2 now.  Let’s do this.”

“Nice job baiting them.  Do that a lot?”

He smiles and I see his team destroy a tower of some sort and their little helpers begin following them as they rip apart the enemy ones.  He pulls back and signals that they should do so.  They follow him and are ambushed by 4 enemy players.  Luckily, they were close enough to have his teammates show up as well, the fight ends with 3 on both sides dead and he and his teammate safe behind one of their towers.     One of the enemy players dies before they realize they are too close.  He laughs and they go after the other player.  Their player runs and barely survives, but they pull back. 

“You know, you don’t have to watch me play to be polite.”

I laugh.  “Not being polite.  Mad skills on display.  I can’t help it.  Oh, crap, 5 minutes before I gotta clock in.”

“What’s going to happen, the Boss Bitch going to fire you?”  He winks.

I look at him and smile.  “You are such a wonderful little asshole.  Thanks!”

“For what…?”

I leave and head to the back.  I get ready, including my new name tag, and walk out.  He comes up to get another drink.  “Did you win?”  I ask.

“You know it…  Wait.  Does your name tag really say Boss Bitch?”

“You know it. Boss Bitch With Perfect Ass was too long.”

He laughs, “You know that review is the first one anyone sees on that site for this place…”

I wink at him.  “You know about half the reviews are just men agreeing with me about it being a perfect ass?”

Shaking his head while laughing as he leaves, he gives me a thumbs up and then sits down at his laptop.  I feel like I have earned some street cred with him.  I smile as the next patron comes in, looks at my name tag, and laughs. 

 

 

**May 22**

One of our newest irregulars is in today. I have not gotten to serve her before. And the first time serving someone is one of my favorite things.

She usually makes mobile orders. Today, she couldn’t, apparently.  She looks upset. She is wearing a white dress under her long grey coat today. Departure from her more common green skirt and grey hoodie theme.  Her hair might give Jackie’s a run for her money in the blazing red category. She always looks so tired. Like she has been crying a lot.

“What would you like to order?”

She points to her throat and shakes her head.  Oh crap, mute.  Okay, I got this.

I go into ASL mode.  “If you point to the online menu of with what you want to order I can make it.  If you want to just tell me hot or cold or spell it I am fine with that.”

Her eyes light up. She begins signing at a ridiculous rate.

“Slow down, still not that good!”

She smiles and we get her order. She has been trying things out and doesn’t have a favorite as far as I can tell. We get a pink drink ordered and she thanks me.   “I normally can tell, but I have no idea which court you even hail from.”

“Unseelie.”

“Not going to say winter court?”

“Even there I am not well liked.”

I shake my head. “I can’t imagine why. You are well mannered, and polite.  Oh, wait, have you met May?  You are going to love her!”

 **May 23**

“Hey Pat, I got our board games put back together after the whole break in thing.  Power Grid was the only one I didn’t have to find anything to replace or fix up.”  Jackie has just finished the last box from our move, it was all the stuff that was like a pile of trash from that break in. 

I look up from my tablet at the small stack of games and nod.  “Nice, I know you like that one.  How did Tsuro fare?”

He shakes her head.  “Total loss.  That seemed to have really gotten on the person’s nerves.  Pieces were broken and the board ripped apart.  I bought a new one.”

“Let me know how much to give to make up my half.”  I am still working on scheduling for next month and she makes a funny noise.

She is smiling at me like some anime character with her hands shaking in fists in front of her.  “This will be the first thing we buy together!”

“Um, why are you being weird?”

She gets a little frown.  “No reason.  I’ll have the amount for you later.”

“Thanks, Red.”  I look up and wink at her.  She smiles back.

We never did find the ring or necklace, so they were definitely stolen.  Neither cost a lot so it wasn’t worth making

 

 

Author’s note:  Yay, we finally have a mermaid!  We will be seeing this one again. Let me know if anything has been unclear. I want to make sure you all can follow my story.

1jlt4pb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jlt4pb,Timestamp Lies,"Okay, another discrepancy is that at the 5:22 minute mark when she goes to put on sweats in her closet for her morning walk. According to her timestamps its between 8-8:30am  
  
But... there's a light by the door with a clock on it.  
  
The clock clearly says 5:45 on it. After a quick edit, she then says again that ""it's still the morning"" and the clock then says 5:47 behind her.  
  
!\[img\](hiflfx2ezere1)  
  
The clock on her oven also looks like it says 12:3x before she goes out for her walk (when she's talking about her car).. which would line up timewise with her then getting home and taking that call from the pool guy at 1:03pm.  
  
And as someone else pointed out, she then cuts this vlog to start her next vlog, and she's wearing the same clothes and the daylight outside looks the same (so i think we can assume she's telling the truth about picking the next vlog up immediately)... in which case her oven says it's 4:28pm when she goes to put the food on the oven.  
  
my hypothesis is that she got up when she normally does, probably around 9am or 10am. got ready slowly anddid some editing, got dressed for her walk around noon, came back after her walk around 1pm and then did her makeup tutorial for a while, went and did something else for a couple hours and then came back and filmed the end of the vlog and beginning of her next vlog. but then went and filmed the early scenes around 5pm (her making the bed, and getting dressed)  
  
Also, I get the vibe that Romeo is a lounge in bed in the morning kind of guy (no judgement!) and so it would make sense that she just gets up and makes coffee without making the bed, leaves the creamer in the cupboard for when Romeo gets up and then in the evening she makes the bed for the vlog. Someone also posted that at 1:03 her bed isn't made in the background as she walks past the archway looking towards their bedroom.  
  
I'm not a snarky person, I find reading this sub very entertaining and I do agree with a LOT of the points that are made about her, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having this routine. However...  
  
...she should've been honest though. there's nothing to be ashamed about! many people would love to have a slow morning like that... she's created a life for her and her family where she can get up when she wants, walk whenever she wants, etc.... but the fact that she lies she tries to seem perfect is getting the opposite reaction she wants, I'm sure! If she c wants to be relatable then she should just be honest about her routine... which is still coveted by many people!  
  
I would also like to point out the amount of times she has filmed her self getting up at \\\~6:30am for markets and estate sales. She's always groggy and her voice is hoarse. I feel like those are honest and that she doesn't actually get up around that time very often... and 7:15 is too close to 6:30 to not be groggy. Meaning, I don't think she gets up at 7:15 every day...

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever find yourself staring at your to-do list, wondering if it somehow multiplied overnight? Yeah, been there. 😅 So last month, I desperately needed to reclaim control over my time – you know, kick procrastination to the curb. My solution? **Time blocking.** 🚀

Now, I know what you're thinking: *""Ugh, another productivity hack?!""* But hear me out. I’ve stumbled onto something so good, I just had to share. 🎉

### Why Time Blocking is My Secret Weapon 🗓️

- **Mental Clarity**: By dedicating specific time slots for different tasks, I was no longer juggling everything in my head. Suddenly, my brain wasn’t a circus anymore. Who knew?!

- **Procrastination Slayer**: When the clock says ""time for deep work,"" there's no room for rabbit holes. Facebook, you can’t seduce me today.

- **Boundaries, Baby!**: I love taking on new projects, but saying “no” is essential, too. Time blocking has given me boundaries to protect my sanity.

### How It Saves Me 10 Hours a Week ⏰

1. **Less Decision Fatigue**: Ever feel exhausted from just deciding what to do next? It’s amazing how draining it is. With time blocks, each hour has a purpose.

2. **Efficient Task Batching**: Emails, calls, and brain-draining admin? They all get batched into one block. I’ve been cut off from reply-all hell. Hallelujah!

3. **Built-in Breaks**: When you set a timer for focused work, those breaks feel deserved. Not sneaky little YouTube benders – looking at you, ""cat fail"" compilations.

### My Time Blocking Formula 🧩

- **Morning Magic (8-10am):** Highest focus tasks. I’m not ready for people yet. Coffee and I are still warming up.

- **Creative Block (10am-12pm):** This is the moment when I let the ideas flow. Thanks to all you amazing folks sharing vibes, inspiration is never far!

- **Admin Attack (1-2pm):** Get those mundane tasks done and dusted. It's like slaying a mini-dragon.

- **People Time (2-4pm):** Meetings, chats, everything social. I’m finally human by then. 😅

But hey, it's not a one-size-fits-all thing. Your ideal schedule will probably look different. Still, why not give time blocking a shot for a week and see how it feels? 🤔 

---

So, team, what’s your take? Do you think time blocking could help you find a little more balance and control? Or does another strategy work for you?

Now, back to my 4pm walk block – gotta recharge and soak in the beauty of the offline world. 🍃

So a boss at work decided that we don't need kettles anymore. They removed the existing kettles in the office and are forbidding us to bring our own. They provided us with automatic coffee machines with a tea water dispenser.

The problem is that the water form the machine is not very hot. It's around 50° Celsius.

I have tried to brew my coffee in my aeropress with the 50°C water. My coffee now tastes lifeless and boring due to what i suspect is the water temperature.

Do you by ANY CHANCE have any good tips for me? I am thinking about starting a kettle revolution at work otherwise.

Eastern and Sel quickly got Nick up and into one of Medicine Hat’s acceleration couches, and they secured themselves. As soon as they had laid down, Nick’s sense of balance was spun all around as Hat tried to avoid the shots coming towards him. Fighting nausea, Nick turned his head and saw Gord standing on the deck, still wearing most of a pressure suit, legs shoulder width apart, seemingly not bothered by the gyrations of the ship, his legs and hips perfectly matching the ship’s motion so that his torso was nearly motionless. He stood with his hands behind his back, and his face dour.



“That’s *Vengeance of Lavinia II*” he said, pointing at the screen. “I thought we accounted for that one.”



“Looks like we missed it, Gord. Maybe they tossed the transponder into space and we scanned it.”



“Where do you think it was hiding?”



“It has traces of diacetylene on the hull; smart money is that it was hiding on Titan.”



“Hmm.” Gord said and continued to watch the screen. 



Nick turned his head and the world began to spin. “Gord?” He said.



Gord turned and regarded Nick. “Hey friend. Good to see you up and awake. We’re a little busy right now, but we can talk as soon as things calm down.”



“H-How are you able to stand when this is all going on?” Nick said, finally.



Gord smiled. “I’m an *AI,* Nick. I’m tied in with Hat’s systems, and can pivot my hips, knees, and ankles in time with his thrusters. I’m stationkeeping.” He said and turned back to the screen.



There was a sickening lurch, and a telltale double boom of juke charges. “That missile was too close, Gord. We gotta do something.”



“What’s Tinker Toy doing?” He asked.



“Tink’s out there?” Eastern said. “How did he escape?”



“He didn’t, technically.” Gord said. “When Um’reli killed him - and yes, her shot was a killing one - Tink recovered from a snapshot. It was right before you got out at Hyacinth, so he knew something bad had happened. He reached out to us and called in a favor, and-” Gord gestured to the screen “-here we are. It is not my preference to fight a *Calamity Class Super Dreadnought*, but honestly, I thought they were all destroyed. I hope this is the last one.”



“Calamity Class…” Nick said



“It’s one of Melody’s ships.” Eastern said, amazed. “She had a whole fleet of them, and was using them to take over Sol when she came.”



“I wouldn’t call seventeen ships a *fleet* Eastern, but you’re right. They were Melody’s. Rather, they belonged to the Empress, and since that seems to be Raaden now, I assume they’re hers. If I recall correctly *Lavinia II* was her ship anyway. Curious.”



“What about the K’laxi ships?” Selkirk said. “I heard something about K’laxi when Raaden was told about the attack on Hyacinth.”



“Oh that’s just Mi’leni having fun. When we linked in, I sent her a buoy letting her know what we were going to do, and she offered to help. They’re buzzing Lavinia and trying to get her to engage them, drawing the heat off us. Whoever is captaining Lavinia is smart though. They realize the K’laxi aren’t a threat.”



“Gord?” Tink's voice was crackly over the radio. “Do you have them?”



“Tink!” Eastern said. “We’re here, we’re with Gord.”



“What happened, Eastern? I recovered from a snapshot I took right after we docked with Hyacinth, it seemed I missed the whole show. Did you win?”



“Oh Tink,” Eastern said, and stifled a sob. “It was all for *nothing*. I’ll tell you about it when we meet next.”



“Speaking of which,” Hat said. “Gord, it’s time to go. Mi’lei has their attention and *Timewinder* already linked away. 



“Okay Hat, you’re the ship. Tink? We’re going Home.”



“You got it, Gord.”



Nick heard the proper noun. “What’s Ho-”



This time, the wormhole link was a more standard one, and Nick did not experience link-death. Sel did though, just like normal, but this time instead of being on the verge of tears, she was smiling. 



“Sel? What happened?” Eastern said, when she noticed her.



“I saw my folks again.” She said. “They said they were proud of me.”



Nick was watching the screen. Ahead was… something. It almost looked like Hyacinth. “Gord, is that an orbital? It looks like Hyacinth.”



“Hah.” He laughed once without humor. “Almost. It’s a colony ship. Launched from Earth more than a thousand years ago, it passed through a gamma ray burst, and every cell aboard was obliterated. We found it a while back and slowed it down. Now, it’s where the AIs can live without fear.” He turned and gestured to the screen. “Welcome Home.”



It might not have been as large as Hyacinth, but it still was gigantic. Medicine Hat and Tinker Toy fit inside the hold, along with at least a dozen other ships of all shapes and sizes. They exited Hat, and Eastern ran to Tink as he climbed out of his ship, in his body.



“Tink!” Eastern practically jumped at him, embracing him tightly. 



“Eastern! I’m glad you three are all right.” He stared at Nick and Selkirk. “You look rough though, what happened?”



“Yes, what did happen?” Gord said, as another person walked out of Medicine Hat. He was taller and more burly than Gord, but still had the same kind of style. Dungarees, flannel and shaggy hair. That must be Medicine Hat, Nick thought. “We’ll take you to a debriefing room and you can explain yourselves.”



It had tuned out that Chloe was there in the room as well, sitting at the head of the table, leaning back in one of the high backed executive chairs, her legs up on the table, crossed. When they walked in, she quickly put her legs down and sat up straight. Gord raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything.



Explaining what happened since the last time that Gord saw them took a few hours. Someone had brought water and coffee, and then a while later snacks were delivered. The AIs might not have the same needs as BIs, but they knew how to be good hosts. 



“So, the “Nanites” you have are an intelligent nanoscale intelligence from another universe who ate *their* whole universe, and looked for another, but finding ours teeming with life decided we were too precious to eat up, so is working with people to build a network of Gates so that they can spread out and look for another universe that’s empty so they can move there and eat that one up?” Gord said, finally.



“Yes, that’s how I understand it.” Eastern said, taking a sip of coffee.



“My goodness.” Gord said. So the whole Voice thing and the-“ he gestured awkwardly “-powers are…”



“Are things that the Nanites give their host to… expedite things.” Eastern said. “They think that a galaxy wide empire is easier to keep track of.”



“Well, with their goals more clear, it does make a *kind* of sense.” Chloe said, looking at Gord. “If you only have to keep track of one BI and they tell everyone else what to do, it is simpler, from their perspective.”



“Yeah *maybe*,” Gord admitted, his face dour. “But it still means controlling people and giving them orders they can’t disobey. I seem to recall a time in our past when that was us.”



“I didn’t say it was a *good* idea, Gord. I just said I can see how it makes sense to them,” Chloe said primly. “This does shed some light on their other activities. The Gate building for example.” She said.



Gord turned to Eastern. “So you were… a lesson?”



“Yeah.” Eastern’s shoulders drooped. “They made me *almost* an Empress to threaten Raaden and get her back on track towards becoming galactic Empress. They thought that her becoming the richest person in Sol was a distraction.”



“Wow.” Gord said. “So everything that you did, was all just to get Raaden to stop monkeying around.”



“Yeah.” Eastern sighed. “The worst part is that I still have the Nanites. They didn’t leave.”



“We know.” Medicine Hat said, his voice deep. “That’s why we haven’t left this room. It’s quarantined.”



“Eastern, Raaden said that the Nanites talk to you. Is that true?” Nick asked.



Eastern looked awkward. “They… did. They don’t now, I think they’re done with me, so there’s no need to pretend that I’ll ever be anything other than a small time con woman.” Her voice sounded more bitter than she expected.



“You never told us,” Selkirk said, quietly.



“They told me not to.” Eastern said. “They said if I told anyone, I would put myself and you in danger. They said that if others knew the Nanites talked to me, I’d be killed.”



“They were right.” Chloe said and stood. “That’s why I asked you when we first met. We knew that Nanites talk to the Empress - and only the Empress - so if they talked to you, we had to eliminate you before you could restart the empire.” Chloe shrugged. “For what it’s worth, I’m glad I didn’t have to kill you.”



“Thanks, I think.” Eastern said. She turned to Gord. “How did you get us out of Hyacinth One?”



“Personal wormhole generator.” Gord said. “They’re frightfully complicated, and they don’t have the… best track record, but it worked, and I got you out before Helen even knew what was happening.



“I had no idea you got anywhere with the personal wormhole generators,” Tink said. “Last I heard “personal” meant the size of a storage container and the accuracy was only within 30 meters.”



“Thirty meters doesn’t seem so bad.” Nick said.



“Not when you’d arrive at your destination spread out over 30 meters.” Tink said and squeezed his eyes shut. “I saw some of the footage.”



“We worked out the kinks while you were having a sulk after the Republic of Saturn fell apart.” Gord said, chiding. “You could have come Home at any time and gotten caught up.”



“I know, I know,” Tink said, and put his hands up in surrender. “It took Nick, Eastern, and Selkirk to make me realize that just existing wasn’t the way forward.”



“Well, I’m glad they finally got through your thick hull and made you realize there was still a world out there.” Gord said and stood. “But, we still have to figure out what to do with you three. You still have around three kilograms of Nanites in you, each.”



“Can they be removed?” Nick asked.



“*Possibly*.” Gord said, and then looked thoughtful “Maybe. But it’ll be risky.”



“Why will it be risky?” Selkirk asked, her ears flicking irritably.



“Well for one, we’ve never done it before. For two, they’re nanoscale machines that can manipulate people’s brains. You tell me that’s not complicated. We’ll probably have to treat them more like a pathogen than a broken machine.” Gord sighed. “Also, if they don’t want to be removed they might try killing the host.”



“I’d say Gord, that we should assume they will try killing the host.” Chloe said and leaned forward. “We’re willing to try it if you are, but be aware that some or all of you may die from the process. We just don’t know.”



“Our options are leave them, and be a target on the Empress’s list forever, no matter what we do or where we go, or let you try and remove them - something you’ve never done before - and it might kill us.”



“Yup.” Gord said and shrugged. “They’re not great options, but be glad you have options at all.”



“I’ll do it.” Eastern said. Her voice was almost a whisper.



“Eastern, wait-” Nick started.



“No. I’ll do it. I don’t want them in me anymore. Gord, Chloe, I accept the risks. Remove them.”



Gord leaned forward and locked eyes with Eastern. “You’re sure?”



She nodded. “Yes, I am.”



“Okay then. Anyone else up for a de-nanoification?”



“A de-nano-what?” Nick said.



“We’re still working out what to call the process, don’t worry about it.” Gord said, sheepishly. “Do you want it or not?”



Selkirk looked at Nick, and then at Eastern. “I’ll do it. If I never heard about nanoscale intelligence again it’ll be too soon.”



Chloe nodded, satisfied. “And you, Nick?”



Nick looked at Eastern. She seemed so sure of her decision. Her face was set, and her eyes were bright, even though Nick could tell she had been crying. Selkirk too. Her tail was still, and she seemed determined.

I just purchased a Delonghi stilosa ec230.bk.
This comes with an unpressurized basket.
I was looking to update the portafilter to a bottomless and also get an IMS basket.

I've read online this originally had a 51mm basket but the latest model in Europe now has a 54mm basket. I tried to measure to confirm but I'm not measuring either of these numbers.

Measurements:
52.5-53mm inside basket
55.5mm inside portafilter
73mm outside ears

Can someone confirm what size portafilter/basket I have?
It would also be great if someone also suggest where to buy online a suitable:
Bottomless portafilter

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

It initially hurt quite a bit but went away.
When I got home I noticed a throbbing sensation around on of my teeth.

Since then I have had a constant aching and throbbing pain around one of my teeth and get a very sharp pain when I bite into something on a specific point of the tooth.

> There are no visible cracks or chips

> The pain is mild, it does not wake me up in the night

> No pain sensation due to hot or cold temperatures 

> I do grind my teeth

> No bleeding

> Area feels tender and tooth hurts when poking it but no sharp pain

> No increase in pain when brushing the tooth

I’m really hoping this is just a bruised ligament? I have booked in for an emergency dentist for a consultation but if anything needs to be done I’m likely going to have to wait for an NHS appointment as I can’t afford to go private for treatment

1jlsmgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jlsmgx/selective_mutism/,Selective mutism,I need someone’s help I’m talking to a therapist for something else but I realized a problem not so long ago. I thought this only affected me as a kid. it’s like I could talk to someone when they were a crush but once I start to like them too much I go mute. like I can’t look at them. I can’t talk to them if I do it comes out like a whisper and I don’t even feel comfortable and I just wanna get the hell out of there. It was fine when I was in elementary but it’s a different story when you get a girlfriend and then all of a sudden you ignore her and can’t talk to her without being aided by text. it’s like I could talk just fine when it’s a group its like I’m able to shut them out for a second but once it’s just them I feel like dying inside. I liked one girl and my voice would just go so quiet I couldn’t even look at her I found her so beautiful she didn’t like me though. And then this other girl we had a good connection. like I never felt so comfortable in my life she was very perceptive and then when I noticed I liked her I made a audible  “fuck”. we were in a coffee shop alone and I had sorta made up my mind that I liked her even though we were friends for about a year. I was kinda obsessed for months ongoing like creepy but I would go to some of her posts on instagram just to see her when she was busy. but because I realized that anxiety was creeping up like even she noticed which is really crazy she was trying to redirect my attention to coffee cups on the Wall and I just couldn’t do it even though I liked her so much like she was great.

Before taking the meds I would skip breakfast and not eat until around lunchtime, which didn't kickstart my appetite and helped to meet my calorie target. Black coffee and sometimes a can of diet coke would tide me over, but I am trying to avoid caffeine on the meds.

Having some troubles with having to get some food in me when I wake up as having even something small will start my appetite and I find myself getting hungry a lot earlier than if I was to skip breakfast.

I've tried a few different small meals in the morning, protein bars, rice cakes with cottage cheese, small protein shakes etc. but ultimately my question is if anyone knows how much I need to consume to ensure the meds work their best, while keeping the calories to a minimum.

The protein shake seems to have the least effect on starting my appetite off for the day but is it (10g of whey, which is roughly 7g of protein) enough to make sure the meds are working effectively?

The cigar's blend may offer hints of dark fruit, earthiness, and a subtle pepperiness that lingers on the palate. The overall experience should be balanced and harmonious, with no single flavor overpowering the others. Consider the joeseph magnus cigar flavors from prior years as a clue to what may come.

The object: I roast coffee. My roaster shows the temperature increase of the beans over time, based on how I set the machine... I record these temperatures as data-points on a kinda random inverval. Usually about every 30 seconds, but sometimes I take more data points per minute, sometimes I dont take any for like a minute. A roast usually takes up to 15-16 min. 

I can easily create a line-chart of a single roast, since I get a CSV-file with all the data-points, and see the temperature-curve for that roast..., the data is expressed as follows:

00:02 (time)  ; 152 (degrees)

00:55 ; 166

01:12 ; 178

...and so on...

MY PROBLEM: I want to compare the roast curves of mulitiple roasts in one chart. BUT that messes up, because the time data across multiple roast are irrigular. One roast might have 10 data points in the first five minutes, another may have 13 data points ... since i can only select 'one' column to be the Y-axis ... the data-points end up at the wrong 'times' on the other roasts ....

any suggestion how to deal with this ?

But regardless they are getting their investment paid for by their tenants. I’m contributing to your asset so that you are able to pay the mortgage, but this does nothing for me long-term. 

Why are we expected to pay for the privilege of ‘maintaining’ a property? Particularly internally…

Land appreciates in value, building materials do not.

Why does it have to be clean for 3-monthly inspections? Surely if you are paying off someone’s asset your living conditions can be whatever you feel like. 

I’m so fucking sick of seeing these patronising cleaning checklists sent to people to prepare for their quarterly privacy invasion. 

It’s so sad to picture a house tenanted for 20ish years, that anyone paying to stay there has been tip-toeing around trying to magically appear as if they don’t exist. Dreading the day where they are chastised and ordered to pay exorbitantly inflated quotes for just living like a normal person. While the owner has their entire mortgage paid for in this time, ON TOP of tenant after tenant being responsible for keeping every cheap Bunnings/Ikea surface pristine and unmarked even years later.

Wear and tear is not damage. Scratches on a floor, a coffee stain on a carpet or a chip in a bench is not damage. That’s how people live normally in a dwelling where building materials are not impenetrable.

All the slumlords retort in unison “iF yOu DoNt WaNt tO fOlloW tHa RuLez tHeN bUy YoUr oWn!!11”

If you want your purchase to appear as if no one has lived in it then maybe don’t let anyone live in it? 

With the kicker being that the ‘damages’ get paid for, everyone’s bond is getting deducted for additional cleaning, yet no one is moving into perfectly clean or spotless places. They are entitled to compensation for things that they can decide to alter or not, they care that it gets changed just as long as we don’t see where the funds actually go. 

Hoping one day it becomes a legal requirement to use the money for what it was claimed for. Also hoping real estates will have to go through an independent agency to approve homes being up to code and liveable standards before it goes to market.

It's been 4 years since my last massive manic episode (BiPolar 1 here) and they seem to happen every 2 to 4 years. 
Things I am doing differently this time: 
• With the help of my PCP I found a psychiatrist I truly enjoy working with and have regular appointments currently scheduled every 2 months
• With her help I have found a med whose side effects don't make me want to dump it down the drain, and I happily take it every night along with my fish oil (all of my other episodes started when I was unmedicated)
• Working on taking my meds at the same time every night. An alarm on my phone reminds me at 9 pm.
• My ex is a night owl and since moving out of his house I try to be asleep by 10 pm, no later that 10:30. Last night I was asleep by 9pm!
• stopped doing uppers of any kind, even making my morning coffee half-caff (this is huge for me as I am a coffee snob and my morning coffee ritual is sacred to me.)
• Also since moving, I am not exposed to cannabis every day and have found it easy to not smoke it.
• FINALLY found a therapist I love. She is smart, intuitive, and full of wisdom. Not to sound egotistical, but I have found in the past that I manipulate therapy when I am smarter than the therapist and therefore don't really benefit from it. She redirects, cuts through my bullshit, and is teaching me excellent tools to help cope.
• One of the things she is helping me with is the possibility I have OCD (I scored a 24 on the Y-BOCS questionnaire). Ruminating thoughts are my kryptonite, and she has been teaching me techniques to address these.
• Staying hydrated and trying to eat regular, healthy meals. Limiting sugar and trying harder to climate foods I recently found out I have allergies to.
• Staying in touch with my support group which includes my parents and a handful of life long friends, and a 'newer' friend who is familiar with mental health issues and helped me through my last manic episode.
• Trying to incorporate a walk, or stetching/yoga, or just sitting outside in the sunshine, every day.
• Taking supplements like Vit C, B 12, and Ashwaganda (helps with stress)
• Contuing my journalling habits
• trying not to smoke more than a half a pack of cigs a day

I'm still worried.

P.S. I have a crisis appointment with psych scheduled for Monday at 9:20.

How do I know when it’s truly time to walk away?,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for six years, and in many ways, he’s a great partner. He:

* Speaks multiple languages and translates articles for me when I ask.
* Is open to new experiences—films, foods, places—without hesitation. He also researches, books, and plans everything.
* Helps me with the paperwork for my freelance business and medical documents—both of which give me a lot of anxiety.
* Matches my cleaning and organization standards, which no one else has.
* Plans our weekly coffee dates and movie nights at home.
* Covers all our expenses without hesitation since I’m currently unemployed—even my toiletries and makeup, not just joint expenses like food.
* Though we rarely go out due to finances, when we do, he plans everything and encourages me to order whatever I want.
* Remembers the things I love and buys them for me on birthdays, Christmas, etc.
* Finds me interesting and listens to me.
* Does all the grocery shopping and meal planning himself, and cooking is split 50/50. He even finds new recipes based on my tastes.

Despite all of this, I feel like my emotional labor is not matched. Where the issue lies:

* If I send him a link (article, video, anything), he won’t read/watch/listen.
* If I ask him to think about something and get back to me, he agrees but never follows through unless I push—and even then, barely.
* If he asks for the name of something in conversation, he never looks it up later.
* When we argue, he gets frustrated and shuts down, saying, “What I’m saying is only making it worse, so I won’t speak.” This ends the conversation instead of resolving it.
* If I’m upset, he doesn’t naturally offer physical comfort. He sits far away until I explicitly ask, and even then, it’s distant—hand on my knee/shoulder, no hug.
* If I ask for tissues while crying, he’ll ask where they are instead of just getting them.
* Years ago, I suggested a restaurant-style date night at home with menus to make our routine more exciting. He agreed but never initiated it. So I did—I made menus, decorated the table, and even played the role of the waiter. Recently, when I was sick, he gave me a menu he had put together (just post-it notes with checkboxes) and asked what I’d like to eat. It was sweet, and I appreciated it, but when I said, “I’ve been waiting for you to do something like this for years,” he just replied, “I know.”

We’ve talked about this before, and last year he promised to work on these things. But no real change has come.

Recently, we discussed it again. He admitted it’s not intentional—he’s just always struggled with time management. There was no further explanation. He’s aware this is about emotional labor, as I’ve clarified. I asked if he wanted to explore a diagnosis like ADHD since I’m neurodiverse and understand those struggles. He said no. Now, he’s promised to present me with a plan this Sunday on how he’ll improve his time management.

I want to believe in it, but I’m scared it’s too little, too late.

I also don’t know how long to wait to see if this plan works. Because of my childhood, I can very easily accept and adapt, and I don’t want another year to pass only to realize nothing has changed.

I have envisioned my life with him—our home, our dogs, our kids. We have clear plans for the future and have openly discussed timelines and our wishes. But kids require constant time management. Some people transform when they become parents, but that’s a huge gamble.

We also live with his dad, and I’m currently unemployed. Leaving would be hard, but I never want to be the person who stayed just because of circumstances. If I do leave, I’ll have to accept that it will take me longer to rebuild.

I know this man adores me. None of this is intentional or malicious, and that almost hurts more. The things he does, he does so well, but this part of our relationship falls off a cliff.

How do I navigate this? How long do I wait? How do I know when it’s truly time to walk away?",0,1743158487.0,relationship_advice,6,0.33,False

I met this girl, good vibes and has everything I was looking for in a woman. She was pretty and when I say she was belive me on this💯, banging body ufff and that smile would make me empty my pockets just to see her happy. She’d notify me about her errands all the time and nothing makes me happy ivo. An instant turn on it is!!

We started off as friends kwanza, when bored or my busy work schedule allows me to hangout I’d hit her up nampick and we go for casual coffee and dessert dates, at times we’d have very nice steak dates in some fancy restaurants around the City. 

She was single and I was as well, so I decided what’s the worst thing that’ll happen if I shoot my shot? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!

I did that and kumbe she was also interested. So it was just a smooth flow. Nilikua nimepewa penalty na goalkeeper hakua kwa post!! After a week or two we actually took a trip together and spent 4 days outside Kenya just to ignite mapenzi😁.

Came back from the trip and resumed to my normal routine (Work, sleep and repeat) but over the weekends when available I’d pick her up tunachill.

Makosa ilianza hapa. Mimi I thought I had bagged the shawty and deep down I knew she’s mine since I asked her to be mine and she agreed and that’s the reason I initiated we take a trip together as a couple.

Kumbe nilikua nafikiria pekee yangu😂😂. One day after we had came back she hit me with “You know I’m not yet your girlfriend?” I panicked kidogo, looked at her and asked “What do you mean by that?”

She looked at me straight in the eyes and said “You have to officially ask me to be your girlfriend”

Awuorooo!!!! Her idea was I should book a fancy hotel, have it decorated with roses, take her to a candle lit dinner (We had gone twice actually), a bottle of wine/champagne and I ask her to be my girlfriend. I thought she was joking until she started insisting on it.

I automatically knew my free trial days were over and that’s how everything fell apart.

My honest opinion is I didn’t have a problem with doing all that but with time lakini shida she started setting the standard for me and insisting on that.

1jls1af,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1jls1af/my_story/,My story,"I survived an emotionally / borderline physically abusive relationship. The reason I say borderline physically abusive is because you don’t have to be physically beaten to be in a physically abusive situation. I think if I would have stayed, I would have been in a very dangerous situation. There is a part of me that just wants to get this out in the open. I haven’t been able to speak about this very much and it’s been almost a year. 

1. Name calling, and constant telling me that I was stupid, things I did were f***ing stupid, and name calling. I was called a Neanderthal once by the man I loved. When I voiced that these things hurt me, I was told that I was “too sensitive” and “over emotional”. He would call me immature and embarrassing often. I would cry and cry and cry because I was just so overly flooded with negative emotions. I’m not like that by nature. He would look at me with this empty look on his face or sometimes ignore me for days. 
2. Display of weapons (he was a police officer, so always carried). The display of these weapons on the coffee table, under the bed, in front of me, were placed as a way to control me. At the time I didn’t think anything of it, but in hindsight, I get extreme discomfort thinking about fights that often got heated and him having such easy access to a weapon that was displayed in front of my face at all times. He would bring the weapons into my house, where I had a roommate, and her concerns for safety were ignored and ridiculed by him under the guise of him being a police officer. 
3. Constant “be-littling” of myself or any of my achievements. It got to the point where the simple things I did such as using a cross walk or taking a shower were incorrect. He was constantly nit picking my appearance. He would tell me I’m out of shape but in an inadvertent way. 
4. Control. He was inadvertently very controlling of me. For example, he wouldn’t out right say it upset him, but if I went out with my girl friends for drinks he would ignore me and treat me horribly. It conditioned me to not want to be treated that way. He always got on me for my drinking, but he was allowed to drink as much as he wanted and act a fool. Rules for thee, not for me, ideology. He wouldn’t let me order my own drinks when with friends. As a matter of fact, he ordered the table drinks, me an apple juice (like I’m an infant) and himself drinks. If I wouldn’t respond to him quickly enough he would text me multiple times or call and get very angry and snappy. 
5. Constant cheating, micro cheating, and lying. Almost too painful for me to go into detail. But yeah, whenever questioned or confronted I always ended up confused and no idea which way was up or down. I had solids evidence blatantly in my face about him cheating, and he would somehow deny it, or deflect, or trauma dump to get me to feel bad. 
6. Physical: he was very rough with me. He wouldn’t road rage with me in the car and I would say I was un comfortable, and then it would make him more mad. He would scream at cars and chase them. He would want me to film him driving and looking cool when I was legit in tears scared about how he was driving. He didn’t care about my safety, just him looking cool. Intimacy with him was empty towards the end, degrading, and as if he was just using my body. He never seemed excited about me. Just wanted to use something to get off. He would constantly ask me why I wouldn’t want to have a 3-some. One time in particular, I was crying over a fight. He tried to initiate intimacy, which felt forced, and then I cried more. I asked him if he loved me…and still wanted to be with me. His response haunts me. He said “I really just don’t understand why you won’t let me have a threesome”. It killed my mood for any type of intimacy (I already wasn’t in the mood, but me crying would usually have some sort of torn on effect to him. I think he enjoyed seeing me hurt and small) and as a result he got upset with me for my body not being able to let him inside of me if you know what I mean. My body completely shut him out. I broke up with him shortly after. I knew then, things were not normal and loving relationships don’t feel this way. 

He set things on fire when he didn’t get his way and was involved in an altercation with another officer abroad. To me, it demonstrates that he had violent tendencies. Even if it wasn’t towards me, I believe that that anger would eventually be turned towards me. It felt like a ticking time bomb. 

How I knew it was bad:

Well, I stayed way longer than I should have. I tried to break up with him at least 3x before I was actually able to. Things were always met with grand apologies and honestly he was so hurtful that he also somehow felt like the medicine I needed to feel better. Classic trauma bond. Here is how I knew things weren’t normal: 

1. He lashed out at me for coming over to his house with sandy feet as I came from the beach. He yelled at me then ignored me for an entire day as I got his apartment dirty (I didn’t). He knew I was at the beach with friends and asked me to come over directly, so he would have known I was Sandy? 
2. When he would raise his voice at me, I would tell him I was scared or uncomfy, and he would tell me it was my fault he raised his voice. 
3. He was becoming meaner and meaner and more controlling over the littlest things. For example, the way I used Google maps was stupid. He exploded on me for the way I loaded the dishwasher, after I had deep cleaned his entire house and never got even a thank you. He wanted to isolate me from my friends. He wanted me to only spend money in a way that served him. He would manipulate situations by buying or paying for something ultra lavish and expensive that I didn’t ask for, then saying “I bought or paid for x y and z and I’m a provider for you so i expect you to be grateful”. He used currency as a way to shut me up off of his foul behavior. Any accountability was always dodged by stating how much he paid. He also would just randomly send me money, but then withhold it over my head. I learned to just stop accepting things from him. 
4. I felt objectified constantly, just with the whole threesome thing and constant micro cheating. I felt he was living a double life. He would always tell his friends he could have any girl he wanted blah blah, and say that right in front of my face. It made me feel awful.
5. He would withhold affection if he was upset, as a punishment for me. I felt like I was in a mental and physical prison with him. It conditioned me to not want to upset him. 
6. The weapons and the forceful nature in which he treated people beneath him. 
7. I think the biggest uh oh moment for me was about a year in, he became a very loud holocaust denier. For myself, I take a particular interest in WW2 history, and would try to engage him on why he felt this way. I can always converse or engage with a different point of view. I wanted him to provide some sort of justification for it. He never could, to me it was just bigot behavior. He would sneer and laugh at me and tell him I needed to “respect” his viewpoints. My whole argument was that he didn’t have a viewpoint bc he couldn’t articulate it. He just very randomly started hating on the holocaust, and I think it was to spite me. He would later bring it up in front of his friends and tell me I was “f***n crazy for getting mad at him not believing in the holocaust”. He was trying to publicly humiliate me. I knew I was in big big trouble but wouldn’t engage otherwise it would be seen as me being argumentative. 
8. There was this constant theme of public embarrassment from him, but if I engaged, I was the bad guy. He poked my buttons on purpose, and if I took the bait or acted emotionally, then all eyes were on me. I lost my crap one time and I’m sure everyone thinks I am the bad guy. I looked this up and it’s called reactive abuse. I had just finally had it mentally emotionally and physically. The event itself it soo painful for me to go into detail. It haunts me to this day. 

Ugh. My message here to anyone who may be experiencing something similar. Please get out while you can. I was so depressed last year. It’s taken me almost a year of healing and reflecting to think about my role in this. I thought that I could change him, if I just loved him enough he would come around. Some people don’t want love. He was one of them. He is blocked from my life because after we broke up he wouldn’t let me heal. He tried to reign me back in just to play games and further break my already damaged and shattered heart. I’m in a relationship now with a man who wouldn’t dare to put me in the situations this guy did. Healthy love is out there and if you can walk away from something abusive, that love will find you too. Thank you for letting me share my story. ",3,1743158054.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

Any recommendations or thoughts are much appreciated!
I’m marketing staff for a sales company, we attend trade shows regularly with our own stand and spend considerable amounts on hospitality. We usually hire a barista + coffee machine station for each event which is pretty costly.
To get away from this, we figured we could get our own machine and train a few of the staff up on how to use it. That way we can use it in the office when not at shows and transport it there when we are to get best use out of it. 
I have a Sage coffee machine at home so I already have in my head that I want the grinder integrated to the machine rather than separate but companies I have been in contact with, that sell larger machines than my own, don’t tend to have the grinder integrated. I don’t know much about these things so any info and recommendations would be welcomed.

1jlrypq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1jlrypq/am_i_the_problem_i_am_autistic/,Am I the problem? (I am autistic),"I can't figure out if it's me who asks for too much or if it's him who is self-centered. We've been living together for 1 year and 2 years as a couple. I am autistic with ADHD, anxiety, and chronic sleep disorder. He may have undiagnosed ADHD. When he moved in with me I had to do a lot... A lot of changes in my life and in my apartment to make room for him. It's normal, I don't blame him for that, but I still want to make it clear.

I always slept with my cats but he didn't like it so we cut off the cat's access to the room at all times to avoid hair in the bed. So in addition to not sleeping with me anymore, their playing territory is now smaller. I started to notice that some of my cats' toys were missing... I found them hiding in places where my cats would not have been able to access. So I asked him the question and he told me that some toys wake him up at night so he takes them off.Except that he never gives them back. It's always me who realizes, sometimes several days later, that my cats' favorite toys are no longer accessible to them. I asked him if it was possible for him to try to sleep with earplugs, which he refused to even try...

When we drive in the car it often happens, during the winter that he turns the heating on to maximum and this during the whole trip. I sometimes end up having trouble breathing because it's so hot, even if I take off my coat. In the summer, if he decides that he is hot... he will open his window... and mine without asking if I'm hot or if I want to have wind in my face. When he mentions that I can't breathe or that I don't want my window to be open, he tells me that the driver's comfort is more important than mine and that therefore means that I have to be uncomfortable for him to be comfortable.

I've always done grocery shopping on Friday nights. There are fewer people, almost never children crying and the employees have filled the stalls for the weekend, so normally everything is in stock. My personal car broke down also about 1 year ago and I still don't have the money to buy a new one so we only have my boyfriend's car which is a manual car and I don't drive manual. (I've tried several times in real life and on a simulator and it's too stressful for me) So I'm taken to wait for him to do everything. (We live in a rural area with no public transit) He doesn't like to go grocery shopping on Fridays because he finishes work on the night of Thursday to Friday at 2:30 am. Normally if he goes to bed as usual he is woken up around 3 pm which leaves us more than enough time to go to the grocery store which closes at 9 pm. Except that instead of going to sleep as usual, most of the time, he goes to play video games and doesn't go to bed until Saturday morning.

When we end up going to the grocery store on Sunday, I can't find half of the products I came to pick up because, given the small number of employees on weekends, they don't fill the shelves. There are always a lot of people in the shops. An incredible number of children crying. Nothing ever goes as planned and I end up most of the time overloaded. But despite several discussions about why it's better for me to go grocery shopping on Friday night, he continues to come home from work and play video games until Saturday morning. And I want to make it clear that he has nothing to do but work. I don't work, I'm in online school only 15 hours a week because I have severe constraints at work. I do all the cleaning, washing, cooking, I make his lunches, I cut his fruit for breakfast and I even prepare his coffee before he wakes up. His one and only obligations are his job and his car. I do absolutely everything else.

Noise didn’t pull me from sleep: no whining of the hallway floorboards under heavy footfalls, no clicking of the bedroom doorknob as a hand twisted it, no groaning of the door’s metal hinges as it creeped forward. To put it more simply, I don’t think *they* woke me up. They were present *when* I woke up, but they didn’t *wake* me up.

It was more like my unconscious body was on a timer.

When that timer ticked down to zero, my head and torso exploded upright in bed, eyelids snapping open like a pair of adjacent window blinds with an anvil attached to their drawstrings. My bedroom was nearly pitch black, save for the faint glimmer of moonlight trickling in from the window beside me, but the pallid glow wasn’t potent enough to illuminate beyond the boundaries of my mattress. As my pupils dilated, widening to accommodate larger and larger gulps of the obscuring darkness, the only noise I heard was the raspy huffs of my own rapid breathing. Otherwise, it was silent.

I went from a deep, dreamless sleep to being uncomfortably awake in a fraction of a second. The transition was so sudden and jarring that it caused a wave of disorientation to ripple across the surface of my skin like goosebumps.

Once my vision adjusted, familiar contours began to emerge from the darkness, and my hyperventilation slowed. The gargantuan wooden armoire opposite my bed. A puddle of dirty clothes accumulating in the room's corner. The slight circular bulge of a wall mirror beside the open door.

Despite the growing landscape of recognizable shadows, my disorientation did not wane. If anything, the sensation intensified. Sitting up in bed, still as the grave, I felt my heartbeat become rabid, drumming wildly against the center of my chest.

*When did I go to sleep? How did I get into bed?*

*What did I do yesterday? Or what was yesterday’s date?*

*Why can’t I remember….?*

Those unsettling questions spun repetitive circles around my mind like the petals of a pinwheel revolving in a gust of wind, but their momentum didn’t generate any answers. Instead, their furious revolutions only served to make me nauseous, vertigo twisting my stomach into knots.

*Maybe a bit of light will help.*

I slid my legs out from under the covers and reached for the lamp on my nightstand, the soles of my overheated feet pleasantly chilled as they contacted the cold hardwood floor.

Before my fingers could even find the tiny twist-knob, I detected something across the room. Paralyzed, my hand hung in the air like a noose. I blinked, squinted, closed and re-opened my eyes. I contorted my gaze in every way I could think of, convinced I was seeing something that wasn’t actually there. Unfortunately, the picture didn’t change.

A human-shaped silhouette stood motionless in my bedroom’s entryway. The figure seemed to be watching me, but I couldn’t see their eyes to be sure.

Automatically, my hand rerouted its trajectory, drifting from in front of the lamp down towards the baseball bat I stored under my bed. The rest of me attempted to match the figure’s stillness while keeping both eyes fixed on its position, as if my stare was the only thing that would keep it locked in place. I felt my fingers crawl along the belly of the metal bedframe like a five-legged tarantula, but they couldn’t seem to locate the steel bat.

Sweat beaded on my forehead. More nervous dewdrops appeared every additional second I endured without a weapon to defend myself, my hand still empty and fumbling below. I wanted to look down, but that choice felt like death: surely the deranged, featureless killer looming a few feet from me would pounce the moment my attention was split.

*Where the fuck is it?* I screamed internally, my focus on the inanimate specter wavering, my eyes desperate to look down and find the bat.

*It should be* ***right*** *there,* ***exactly*** *where my hand is.*

I lost control, and when my head started involuntarily tilting towards my feet, I saw the shadow-wreathed intruder turn and sprint away. My head shot up, the loud thumping of a hasty retreat becoming more distant as they raced through the first-floor hallway.

*“****Hey!****”* I shouted after them, apparently at a loss for anything better to say. Once the word erupted from my lips, I felt my palm finally land on the handle of the bat. It was much deeper than I anticipated.

As soon as I had pulled the weapon out from under the bed, I was rushing after the nameless figure.

\- - - - -

In retrospect, the fearlessness behind my pursuit was undeniably strange. Which is not to imply that I’m a coward. I think I’d score perfectly average for bravery when compared to the rest of the population. That’s the point, though: I’m not a coward, but I’m certainly not lionhearted, either. And yet, when I was running down that hallway, my plan wasn’t to burst out the front door, fleeing to a neighbor’s house where I could call the cops.

No, I was *chasing* them. Recklessly and without a second thought.

I found myself hounding after the faceless voyeur through my completely unlit home in the dead of night, going from room to room and clearing them like a one-man SWAT team, with only a weathered bat for protection. Startled and riddled with adrenaline, sure, but not scared. Even when I came to find that the electricity was out, flicking various light switches up and down to no avail as I searched for the intruder, my psyche wasn’t rattled.

The dauntless courage was inexplicable, discordant with the situation, and out of character. Its source would become clear in time. For those few minutes, however, I was all instinct: intuition made flesh.

Subconsciously, I knew I wasn’t in danger.

Not from anything *inside* my house, anyway.

\- - - - -

No one on the first floor: living room, kitchen, downstairs bathroom, all vacant.

No broken windows. No front door left ajar. No visible tracks in the snow when I briefly peered into my front and backyard.

No one on the second floor, either: guest bedroom, workshop, upstairs bathroom all without obvious signs of trespass. That said, by the time I was clearing rooms on the second floor, I had begun to experience an abrupt and peculiar shift in my state of mind: one that made my investigation of those spaces a little less vigorous, and a lot less through.

Somehow, I became drowsy.

No more than three minutes had passed since I launched myself from bed, bloodthirsty and on the hunt, and in those one hundred and eighty seconds I had become deeply fatigued: listless, disinterested, and depleted of adrenaline. When I reached the top of the stairs, I could barely keep my eyes open. I felt drained: utterly anemic, like a swarm of invisible mosquitos had started to bleed me dry the moment I left my bedroom.

Of course, that made no sense. There was a high likelihood that whoever had been looming in my bedroom doorway was still inside. Still, I wasn’t concerned. That ominous loose end hardly even registered in my brain: it bounced off my new, dense layer of exhaustion like someone trying to pierce the side of a tank with a letter opener.

I poked my head in each upstairs room and gave those dark spaces a cursory scan, but nothing more. It just didn’t seem necessary.

Satisfied with the search effort, I trudged back down the stairs, yawning as I went. Twenty languid steps later, my heels hit the landing. With one hand gripping the banister and the other scratching the small of my back, I was about to turn left and continue on to my bedroom, but I paused for a moment, absorbed by a detail so unnerving that it managed to break through my thick, hypnotic malaise.

I furrowed my brow and looked down at my hands.

*Where the hell did the bat go?*

I couldn’t recall dropping it, but the concern didn’t last. After a few seconds, I shrugged and started walking again. Figured I left it somewhere upstairs and that I could find it in the morning. Which, to reiterate, was a decision wholly detached from reality. As far as I knew, there was still some stranger skulking around my home with unknown intent.

The idea of *dealing with it in the morning* stirred something within me, though. As I proceeded down the unlit hall, all of those other questions, the ones from before I noticed the figure in the doorway, began gurgling back up to the surface.

*What did I do yesterday morning?*

*Or last week?*

*Where is everyone?,* though I wasn’t sure who *“everyone”* even was.

It was disconcerting not to have the answers to *any* of those questions, but, just like the bat, they felt like problems that would be better dealt with after I got some sleep. I was simply too damn tired to care. That changed as I stepped into the open bedroom doorway.

I stopped dead in my tracks, stunned.

Somehow, the intruder had slipped past me. Now, they were lying on their side, under the covers, chest facing the wall opposite to the door.

Asleep.

Before that moment, my exhaustion was a shell: rigid armor shielding me from the sharpened tips of those unanswered questions. The shock of seeing *them* in my bed cleansed my exhaustion in an instant, flaying my protective carapace, making me vulnerable and panic-stricken.

*What…what is this?* I thought, wide-eyed and rooted to the floor.

The figure let out a whistling snore and turned on to their back. Moonlight from the window above my bed cast a silvery curtain over their body, illuminating their face with a pallid glow. I felt lightheaded. My brain fought against the revelation, working overtime to concoct a rational explanation.

An oddly shaped, wine-colored birthmark crested over the edge of their jaw, which made their identity undeniable.

It was me.

And I was currently frozen in the *exact same* spot the intruder stood when I jolted awake.

The figure exploded upright. The motion was jerky and mechanical, more akin to a wooden bird shooting out of a chiming cuckoo clock rather than anything recognizably human. They stared straight ahead, and because my bed was positioned in parallel to the wall opposite the door, they hadn’t seen me yet. I couldn’t move. Mostly, paralyzing disbelief kept me glued in place. But some small part of me had a different reason for staying still.

I could move, but I *shouldn’t*.

It wasn’t time yet.

Eventually, they swung their legs around the side of the bed, reached to turn on the lamp, stopping their hand only once they saw me.

My mind writhed and squirmed under the fifty-ton weight that was the uncanny scene unfolding before my eyes. It was like watching a stage-play based on a moment I lived no more than half an hour ago, and, weirdest of all, I was part of the cast, but I wasn’t playing myself.

Once the figure started going for the baseball bat, I knew that was my cue to run.

I heard them yell a muffled “***Hey!***” from behind me, but that didn’t stifle me. I sprinted down the dark hallway, past the living room, taking a right turn when I reached the landing. My legs bounded up the stairs, propelled by some internal directive that my conscious mind wasn’t privy to. Another sharp right turn as I hit the top of the stairs and moments later, I was sliding under the guest bed, picking up the bat I had absentmindedly deposited in the middle of the room as I did.

No hesitation. No back-and-forth inner debate about what I should do next. There was only one right choice to make, and I made it.

I steadied my breathing and waited. The guest room was impenetrably dark, thanks to the power outage and the lack of windows, so I couldn’t see anything from my hiding spot. I heard the commotion of the frenzied downstairs search, feet shuffling and doors slamming, followed by the soft plodding footsteps of the more lethargic inspection upstairs. It was all identical to my actions minutes before.

Then, there was nothing: near-complete sensory deprivation. My view from under the bed was an ocean of black ink. All I could hear was the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I could feel was my hand wrapped around the handle of the bat and the cold wooden floor against my skin. After a little while, I was numb to those sensations as well - I heard nothing, felt nothing, saw nothing. The tide of ink had risen up and swallowed me whole.

I couldn’t tell you how long I spent submerged in those abyssal depths, falling deeper and deeper, never quite reaching the bottom. All I know is what I saw next.

Two human feet, slowly being lowered over the edge of the mattress and onto the floor. Before my mind could be pummeled by another merciless barrage of disorientation, another appendage appeared, and it focused my attention.

A hand.

It crawled along the underside of the bedframe, getting precariously close to touching me, its fingers clearly probing for something. As quietly as I could, I maneuvered the bat around the confined space, positioning it so the scouring digits connected gently with the handle.

The palm latched onto it, heavy and vicious like the bite of a lamprey, and pulled it out from under the bed. For the third time that night, I heard footsteps thump down the hall, my voice shout the word *“****Hey!****”,* and another pair of footsteps chase after the first.

As soon as I was alone, I rolled out from under the bed to discover that I was no longer upstairs. Somehow, I was now in my bedroom, one floor below where I had been hiding, standing over my mattress.

Against all logic, I wasn’t concerned - I was drowsy. I knew I should lie down and fall asleep. I was aware that it was in my best interest to start the cycle all over again. But before I could, I noticed something outside my window. Something new. Something that hadn’t been there when I woke up the first time.

I don’t know if the pilgrim intended to wrench me from my trance when he engraved those cryptic symbols into the tree right outside my bedroom window, on his way up the mountain to pay tribute to the thing that caused all of this. Maybe it was just a coincidence. He’d drawn it pretty much everywhere: Lovecraftian graffiti scrawled across every available surface in the abandoned town.

Or maybe he could sense my trance: the circular motion that was warding off the change that had killed everyone else. Maybe he knew seeing those images would awaken me.

Once my eyes traced those jagged edges, everything seemed to snap back into place. I was finally awake and truly alone in my house. The perpetual stage-play had come to a close.

According to the pilgrim, it was a snake, an eye, and a cross, followed by an identical eye and snake. All in a row.

To me, it looked like a word, though I had no idea what it meant.

*sOtOs.*

\- - - - -

Who knows how many times that cycle had played itself out, my memory resetting once I fell back asleep.

More to the point, who knows how many times it *would have* played itself out if I didn’t incidentally glimpse the tree outside my window.

In the end, though, I suppose it doesn’t matter.

After I broke through that trance, I would wander into town. See what became of everyone I knew in the two months I was dormant. Discuss the unraveling of existence with the pilgrim over wispy firelight. Then, when he changed, I ran down the mountain, broken by fear.

I’ve considered calling the police. So far, though, I haven’t found a justifiable reason to do so.

Everyone’s already dead. There’s nothing to salvage and no one to save.

They probably wouldn’t believe me, either.

That said, they’d likely still investigate, and inevitably would succumb to it just like everyone else had. What good is that going to do?

The area needs to be quarantined: excised from the landscape wholesale like a necrotic limb.

So, here I am, typing this up on borrowed internet at a coffee shop, trying to warn you all.

The pilgrim was right, though. I didn’t want to believe him, but it’s happening.

Now that I’m out of my dormancy, he told me I’d start to change, too. He said that the trance was my blood protecting me. He endorsed my change would be more gradual, but it would happen all the same. Not only that, but I'd live through it, unlike everyone else.

I can see the other patrons looking at me. Shocked, horrified stares.

Need to find somewhere else to finish this. Once I’m safe, I’ll fill in the rest of the story: the pilgrim, the change, the thing we found under the soil that caused this. All of it.

In the meantime, if you come across a forest where the tops of the trees are curling towards the ground and growing into themselves, and it smells of sugar mixed with blood, or lavender mixed with sulfur, and the atmosphere feels dense and granular, dragging against your skin as you move through it:

Hello again folks! Your resident performance obsessed Redditor here, with my updated Pagespeed guide! It's gone through significant revisions since the last time I posted it. It has grown another 16 pages, up from 368 to over 384+ (and growing!) pages of content. It's officially hit full on novel length!

Major content additions, expansions on everything that was previously in the guide, significantly better and more logical organization, revamped table of contents, grammar and spelling fixes, many new optimization strategies and much needed additional specificity.

**[Don’t forget to check the table of contents, it is not expanded by default! The icon is on the top left side on desktop](https://imgur.com/a/GjsPhfo)**

Included is a breakdown on how to analyze and interpret Speed Test reports to identify optimization opportunities.

Wordpress specific optimizations: It has sections on how to optimize common features including Ads, Forms, Woocommerce, Analytics, Google Maps, Custom Fields, Galleries, Video Players, Sliders, Filters, SEO plugins, Anti-Spam, Cookie Notices, Backup plugins; in addition to one size fits all optimizations(Images, Videos, CDN, SSL, CSS, JS, Resource Hints, Fonts, Caching, HTML Document size, DOM optimization, etc), and tons and tons more.

There's an extensive amount of optimization information and resources for server stack configuration for NGINX, Apache, OpenLiteSpeed, Varnish, Object Caching, PHP, HAProxy, MySQL, SSL, Gzip/Brotli, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, Security considerations effects on performance and Linux optimizations. There are also a bunch of resources on database optimization.

Every optimization opportunity has a free plugin option (or multiple) listed. Some paid plugins are included as I find them very useful(Perfmatters and Asset Cleanup Pro for example). However I've included alternatives for all paid options. Every single thing in my guide can be implemented for free. 

I've done my best to cover all of the bases you’d find in any page speed guide, in addition to a focus on adding uncommon optimization strategies and solutions that you won’t find in any off the shelf guide. This is a compilation of all of my research over the last 6 years delving into performance optimization.

I'm confident that if you follow every single step in the guide, almost any site you maintain can score 90+ on a Pagespeed Insights Mobile Speed Test. 

If you notice anything missing from my performance guide that you think I should add, or if there is some information you believe needs to be amended (or expanded on), please let me know in the comments and I'll be sure to add a section or revise the content on the topic (if necessary) as soon as possible!

If you feel that the guide is too overwhelming and you'd prefer to have someone else optimize your site’s performance or need a consultation, feel free to DM me.

If anyone wants to be able to import a large set of free optimization plugins (and you can selectively choose which ones to download/install), download WP Favs. I do need to update the collection since I've added tons to the guide since the last time I posted this, but it's still comprehensive:

Noise didn’t pull me from sleep: no whining of the hallway floorboards under heavy footfalls, no clicking of the bedroom doorknob as a hand twisted it, no groaning of the door’s metal hinges as it creeped forward. To put it more simply, I don’t think *they* woke me up. They were present *when* I woke up, but they didn’t *wake* me up.

It was more like my unconscious body was on a timer.

When that timer ticked down to zero, my head and torso exploded upright in bed, eyelids snapping open like a pair of adjacent window blinds with an anvil attached to their drawstrings. My bedroom was nearly pitch black, save for the faint glimmer of moonlight trickling in from the window beside me, but the pallid glow wasn’t potent enough to illuminate beyond the boundaries of my mattress. As my pupils dilated, widening to accommodate larger and larger gulps of the obscuring darkness, the only noise I heard was the raspy huffs of my own rapid breathing. Otherwise, it was silent.

I went from a deep, dreamless sleep to being uncomfortably awake in a fraction of a second. The transition was so sudden and jarring that it caused a wave of disorientation to ripple across the surface of my skin like goosebumps.

Once my vision adjusted, familiar contours began to emerge from the darkness, and my hyperventilation slowed. The gargantuan wooden armoire opposite my bed. A puddle of dirty clothes accumulating in the room's corner. The slight circular bulge of a wall mirror beside the open door.

Despite the growing landscape of recognizable shadows, my disorientation did not wane. If anything, the sensation intensified. Sitting up in bed, still as the grave, I felt my heartbeat become rabid, drumming wildly against the center of my chest.

*When did I go to sleep? How did I get into bed?*

*What did I do yesterday? Or what was yesterday’s date?*

*Why can’t I remember….?*

Those unsettling questions spun repetitive circles around my mind like the petals of a pinwheel revolving in a gust of wind, but their momentum didn’t generate any answers. Instead, their furious revolutions only served to make me nauseous, vertigo twisting my stomach into knots.

In the end, though, I suppose it doesn’t matter.

After I broke through that trance, I would wander into town. See what became of everyone I knew in the two months I was dormant. Discuss the unraveling of existence with the pilgrim over wispy firelight. Then, when he changed, I ran down the mountain, broken by fear.

I’ve considered calling the police. So far, though, I haven’t found a justifiable reason to do so.

Everyone’s already dead. There’s nothing to salvage and no one to save.

They probably wouldn’t believe me, either.

That said, they’d likely still investigate, and inevitably would succumb to it just like everyone else had. What good is that going to do?

The area needs to be quarantined: excised from the landscape wholesale like a necrotic limb.

So, here I am, typing this up on borrowed internet at a coffee shop, trying to warn you all.

The pilgrim was right, though. I didn’t want to believe him, but it’s happening.

Now that I’m out of my dormancy, he told me I’d start to change, too. He said that the trance was my blood protecting me. He endorsed my change would be more gradual, but it would happen all the same. Not only that, but I'd live through it, unlike everyone else.

I can see the other patrons looking at me. Shocked, horrified stares.

Need to find somewhere else to finish this. Once I’m safe, I’ll fill in the rest of the story: the pilgrim, the change, the thing we found under the soil that caused this. All of it.

In the meantime, if you come across a forest where the tops of the trees are curling towards the ground and growing into themselves, and it smells of sugar mixed with blood, or lavender mixed with sulfur, and the atmosphere feels dense and granular, dragging against your skin as you move through it:

Noise didn’t pull me from sleep: no whining of the hallway floorboards under heavy footfalls, no clicking of the bedroom doorknob as a hand twisted it, no groaning of the door’s metal hinges as it creeped forward. To put it more simply, I don’t think *they* woke me up. They were present *when* I woke up, but they didn’t *wake* me up.

It was more like my unconscious body was on a timer.

When that timer ticked down to zero, my head and torso exploded upright in bed, eyelids snapping open like a pair of adjacent window blinds with an anvil attached to their drawstrings. My bedroom was nearly pitch black, save for the faint glimmer of moonlight trickling in from the window beside me, but the pallid glow wasn’t potent enough to illuminate beyond the boundaries of my mattress. As my pupils dilated, widening to accommodate larger and larger gulps of the obscuring darkness, the only noise I heard was the raspy huffs of my own rapid breathing. Otherwise, it was silent.

I went from a deep, dreamless sleep to being uncomfortably awake in a fraction of a second. The transition was so sudden and jarring that it caused a wave of disorientation to ripple across the surface of my skin like goosebumps.

Once my vision adjusted, familiar contours began to emerge from the darkness, and my hyperventilation slowed. The gargantuan wooden armoire opposite my bed. A puddle of dirty clothes accumulating in the room's corner. The slight circular bulge of a wall mirror beside the open door.

Despite the growing landscape of recognizable shadows, my disorientation did not wane. If anything, the sensation intensified. Sitting up in bed, still as the grave, I felt my heartbeat become rabid, drumming wildly against the center of my chest.

*When did I go to sleep? How did I get into bed?*

*What did I do yesterday? Or what was yesterday’s date?*

*Why can’t I remember….?*

Those unsettling questions spun repetitive circles around my mind like the petals of a pinwheel revolving in a gust of wind, but their momentum didn’t generate any answers. Instead, their furious revolutions only served to make me nauseous, vertigo twisting my stomach into knots.

*Maybe a bit of light will help.*

I slid my legs out from under the covers and reached for the lamp on my nightstand, the soles of my overheated feet pleasantly chilled as they contacted the cold hardwood floor.

Before my fingers could even find the tiny twist-knob, I detected something across the room. Paralyzed, my hand hung in the air like a noose. I blinked, squinted, closed and re-opened my eyes. I contorted my gaze in every way I could think of, convinced I was seeing something that wasn’t actually there. Unfortunately, the picture didn’t change.

A human-shaped silhouette stood motionless in my bedroom’s entryway. The figure seemed to be watching me, but I couldn’t see their eyes to be sure.

Automatically, my hand rerouted its trajectory, drifting from in front of the lamp down towards the baseball bat I stored under my bed. The rest of me attempted to match the figure’s stillness while keeping both eyes fixed on its position, as if my stare was the only thing that would keep it locked in place. I felt my fingers crawl along the belly of the metal bedframe like a five-legged tarantula, but they couldn’t seem to locate the steel bat.

Sweat beaded on my forehead. More nervous dewdrops appeared every additional second I endured without a weapon to defend myself, my hand still empty and fumbling below. I wanted to look down, but that choice felt like death: surely the deranged, featureless killer looming a few feet from me would pounce the moment my attention was split.

*Where the fuck is it?* I screamed internally, my focus on the inanimate specter wavering, my eyes desperate to look down and find the bat.

*It should be* ***right*** *there,* ***exactly*** *where my hand is.*

I lost control, and when my head started involuntarily tilting towards my feet, I saw the shadow-wreathed intruder turn and sprint away. My head shot up, the loud thumping of a hasty retreat becoming more distant as they raced through the first-floor hallway.

*“****Hey!****”* I shouted after them, apparently at a loss for anything better to say. Once the word erupted from my lips, I felt my palm finally land on the handle of the bat. It was much deeper than I anticipated.

As soon as I had pulled the weapon out from under the bed, I was rushing after the nameless figure.

\- - - - -

In retrospect, the fearlessness behind my pursuit was undeniably strange. Which is not to imply that I’m a coward. I think I’d score perfectly average for bravery when compared to the rest of the population. That’s the point, though: I’m not a coward, but I’m certainly not lionhearted, either. And yet, when I was running down that hallway, my plan wasn’t to burst out the front door, fleeing to a neighbor’s house where I could call the cops.

No, I was *chasing* them. Recklessly and without a second thought.

I found myself hounding after the faceless voyeur through my completely unlit home in the dead of night, going from room to room and clearing them like a one-man SWAT team, with only a weathered bat for protection. Startled and riddled with adrenaline, sure, but not scared. Even when I came to find that the electricity was out, flicking various light switches up and down to no avail as I searched for the intruder, my psyche wasn’t rattled.

The dauntless courage was inexplicable, discordant with the situation, and out of character. Its source would become clear in time. For those few minutes, however, I was all instinct: intuition made flesh.

Subconsciously, I knew I wasn’t in danger.

Not from anything *inside* my house, anyway.

\- - - - -

No one on the first floor: living room, kitchen, downstairs bathroom, all vacant.

No broken windows. No front door left ajar. No visible tracks in the snow when I briefly peered into my front and backyard.

No one on the second floor, either: guest bedroom, workshop, upstairs bathroom all without obvious signs of trespass. That said, by the time I was clearing rooms on the second floor, I had begun to experience an abrupt and peculiar shift in my state of mind: one that made my investigation of those spaces a little less vigorous, and a lot less through.

Somehow, I became drowsy.

No more than three minutes had passed since I launched myself from bed, bloodthirsty and on the hunt, and in those one hundred and eighty seconds I had become deeply fatigued: listless, disinterested, and depleted of adrenaline. When I reached the top of the stairs, I could barely keep my eyes open. I felt drained: utterly anemic, like a swarm of invisible mosquitos had started to bleed me dry the moment I left my bedroom.

Of course, that made no sense. There was a high likelihood that whoever had been looming in my bedroom doorway was still inside. Still, I wasn’t concerned. That ominous loose end hardly even registered in my brain: it bounced off my new, dense layer of exhaustion like someone trying to pierce the side of a tank with a letter opener.

I poked my head in each upstairs room and gave those dark spaces a cursory scan, but nothing more. It just didn’t seem necessary.

Satisfied with the search effort, I trudged back down the stairs, yawning as I went. Twenty languid steps later, my heels hit the landing. With one hand gripping the banister and the other scratching the small of my back, I was about to turn left and continue on to my bedroom, but I paused for a moment, absorbed by a detail so unnerving that it managed to break through my thick, hypnotic malaise.

I furrowed my brow and looked down at my hands.

*Where the hell did the bat go?*

I couldn’t recall dropping it, but the concern didn’t last. After a few seconds, I shrugged and started walking again. Figured I left it somewhere upstairs and that I could find it in the morning. Which, to reiterate, was a decision wholly detached from reality. As far as I knew, there was still some stranger skulking around my home with unknown intent.

The idea of *dealing with it in the morning* stirred something within me, though. As I proceeded down the unlit hall, all of those other questions, the ones from before I noticed the figure in the doorway, began gurgling back up to the surface.

*What did I do yesterday morning?*

*Or last week?*

*Where is everyone?,* though I wasn’t sure who *“everyone”* even was.

It was disconcerting not to have the answers to *any* of those questions, but, just like the bat, they felt like problems that would be better dealt with after I got some sleep. I was simply too damn tired to care. That changed as I stepped into the open bedroom doorway.

I stopped dead in my tracks, stunned.

Somehow, the intruder had slipped past me. Now, they were lying on their side, under the covers, chest facing the wall opposite to the door.

Asleep.

Before that moment, my exhaustion was a shell: rigid armor shielding me from the sharpened tips of those unanswered questions. The shock of seeing *them* in my bed cleansed my exhaustion in an instant, flaying my protective carapace, making me vulnerable and panic-stricken.

*What…what is this?* I thought, wide-eyed and rooted to the floor.

The figure let out a whistling snore and turned on to their back. Moonlight from the window above my bed cast a silvery curtain over their body, illuminating their face with a pallid glow. I felt lightheaded. My brain fought against the revelation, working overtime to concoct a rational explanation.

An oddly shaped, wine-colored birthmark crested over the edge of their jaw, which made their identity undeniable.

It was me.

And I was currently frozen in the *exact same* spot the intruder stood when I jolted awake.

The figure exploded upright. The motion was jerky and mechanical, more akin to a wooden bird shooting out of a chiming cuckoo clock rather than anything recognizably human. They stared straight ahead, and because my bed was positioned in parallel to the wall opposite the door, they hadn’t seen me yet. I couldn’t move. Mostly, paralyzing disbelief kept me glued in place. But some small part of me had a different reason for staying still.

I could move, but I *shouldn’t*.

It wasn’t time yet.

Eventually, they swung their legs around the side of the bed, reached to turn on the lamp, stopping their hand only once they saw me.

My mind writhed and squirmed under the fifty-ton weight that was the uncanny scene unfolding before my eyes. It was like watching a stage-play based on a moment I lived no more than half an hour ago, and, weirdest of all, I was part of the cast, but I wasn’t playing myself.

Once the figure started going for the baseball bat, I knew that was my cue to run.

I heard them yell a muffled “***Hey!***” from behind me, but that didn’t stifle me. I sprinted down the dark hallway, past the living room, taking a right turn when I reached the landing. My legs bounded up the stairs, propelled by some internal directive that my conscious mind wasn’t privy to. Another sharp right turn as I hit the top of the stairs and moments later, I was sliding under the guest bed, picking up the bat I had absentmindedly deposited in the middle of the room as I did.

No hesitation. No back-and-forth inner debate about what I should do next. There was only one right choice to make, and I made it.

I steadied my breathing and waited. The guest room was impenetrably dark, thanks to the power outage and the lack of windows, so I couldn’t see anything from my hiding spot. I heard the commotion of the frenzied downstairs search, feet shuffling and doors slamming, followed by the soft plodding footsteps of the more lethargic inspection upstairs. It was all identical to my actions minutes before.

Then, there was nothing: near-complete sensory deprivation. My view from under the bed was an ocean of black ink. All I could hear was the sound of my own heartbeat, and all I could feel was my hand wrapped around the handle of the bat and the cold wooden floor against my skin. After a little while, I was numb to those sensations as well - I heard nothing, felt nothing, saw nothing. The tide of ink had risen up and swallowed me whole.

I couldn’t tell you how long I spent submerged in those abyssal depths, falling deeper and deeper, never quite reaching the bottom. All I know is what I saw next.

Two human feet, slowly being lowered over the edge of the mattress and onto the floor. Before my mind could be pummeled by another merciless barrage of disorientation, another appendage appeared, and it focused my attention.

A hand.

It crawled along the underside of the bedframe, getting precariously close to touching me, its fingers clearly probing for something. As quietly as I could, I maneuvered the bat around the confined space, positioning it so the scouring digits connected gently with the handle.

The palm latched onto it, heavy and vicious like the bite of a lamprey, and pulled it out from under the bed. For the third time that night, I heard footsteps thump down the hall, my voice shout the word *“****Hey!****”,* and another pair of footsteps chase after the first.

As soon as I was alone, I rolled out from under the bed to discover that I was no longer upstairs. Somehow, I was now in my bedroom, one floor below where I had been hiding, standing over my mattress.

Against all logic, I wasn’t concerned - I was drowsy. I knew I should lie down and fall asleep. I was aware that it was in my best interest to start the cycle all over again. But before I could, I noticed something outside my window. Something new. Something that hadn’t been there when I woke up the first time.

I don’t know if the pilgrim intended to wrench me from my trance when he engraved those cryptic symbols into tree right outside my bedroom window, on his way up the mountain to pay tribute to the thing that caused all of this. Maybe it was just a coincidence. He’d drawn it pretty much everywhere: Lovecraftian graffiti scrawled across every available surface in the abandoned town.

Or maybe he could sense my trance: the circular motion that was warding off the change that had killed everyone else. Maybe he knew seeing those images would awaken me.

Once my eyes traced those jagged edges, everything seemed to snap back into place. I was finally awake and truly alone in my house. The perpetual stage-play had come to a close.

According to the pilgrim, it was a snake, an eye, and a cross, followed by an identical eye and snake. All in a row.

To me, it looked like a word, though I had no idea what it meant.

*sOtOs.*

So many places to see and go to and people to meet, and stuff to happen…epic stories to live through and tell.
Yup… totally agree. Fully worthwhile.

But let’s hit the pause button a moment.
I’ve a story to tell.

Time to contemplate dark thoughts.

Middle of bumfuck Australia. Northern Territory somewhere to be close enough. I’d been riding along for a while and thinking… ‘ I could have a coffee here in the middle of the road and nobody would know or ever see…’

Yeah. It’s proper empty place stuff. And it got to me. So I did. Literally, stopped… in the middle of the track…and made coffee. I carry a mini coffee percolator and ground beans. I’ll do it rough, but I’m am GOING TO HAVE COFFEE in the mornings. Don’t argue. My kit and I’ll carry what I think is worth it? This is not something I’ll negotiate over ok? We all have our kinks… and I will have good coffee at will. And I’d offer a brew to those whom I meet as I go… a random joyful gift yes? And it gives me time to truely contemplate where I happen to be… a good thing yes?

Anyway. Back to the story? I literally pulled up, got off, stripped my gear off, got my micro chair out and lit a mini gas stove, made percolated coffee, and quietly ate 2 snack bars while contemplating the emptiness and waiting for that bubbling noise. Bliss… except for the flies. How in the actual fuck do flies live on/in the most Martian landscape I can possibly find… and then find me within less than 28 seconds of stopping the bike?

Sigh. But this brings me to the point of the post. I’m there, enjoying the moment. Except for the flies..and the massive purple bruising up one side. Here in lies the lesson and wisdom.

If going out seriously off the beaten path? Make sure you can get back.
I’m talking lying on a track literally hundreds of kilometres from the nearest hospital, winded as all fuck. Stunned, pinned, and wondering just exactly how badly I’m hurt. Yeah. Not good. Stacked it and I’m pinned under the bike. It’s a big girl. Tiger XCX for the enquiring mind. Fully packed for a 3 week journey. So it’s fucking heavy. And it’s literally lying on me in the middle of the track and my first thought is how far I am from help. My buddy is ahead. It’ll be 20 minutes easy before he pulls up, waits, gets the shits over waiting, waits some more… then back tracks to see if I’ve crashed. 

So first up is ‘am I dying’? Cause it was a big hit. Next is the instinctive ‘get it the fuck off’ moment. I’m so hurt and cannot breathe and I’m just lying there after crashing and it’s…processing… processing and the brain comes alive and is like… ‘move… get out from under it and see if you can move’ cause nobody is coming and I’m at survival level. I fight to get out clear and just crawl away. Force myself to breathe just to see what hurts. It does. A lot. Crawl further.

Walk dammit. Get on your feet. You need to know. I’m running on something really ancient at this point, reptile level. The body is running a systems check… and the diagnostic is not happy.

Finally I realise I’m not really badly broken, breathing, not leaking, but stuff might be cracked. The world around me? Is primal bush land… and it gives zero shits about my moment. Peaceful place to die yeah?

This? This is what I’m posting about. I’m functioning but it’s questionable. And would have been so easy to find I had a broken leg, hip, ribs, arm… you get what I’m saying? I’m literally hundreds of kilometres from the nearest hospital and I know it. I’m trying to figure if I’m calling a chopper.

Cause I can. I had a Garmin ‘In Reach’ in my jacket pocket. On me. Even trapped and bad fucked up I stand a chance. And that was part of my planning.
The reason for this post. 

Go. Do the journey. Plan and make it happen. I’m currently beginning to plan a Canning Stockroute attempt. Totally worth it.

And so is that extra $$ that you never want spend or to use. That option. The actual option to call a fucking helicopter with a paramedic to come and get you out of the shit. Cause you would give ANYTHING to see them in that exact moment. Money is no longer in question.

Do the dream journey. But acknowledge the risks a deep run brings. You? Are the only person responsible for self rescue. The minutes might count. And it’ll be hours at best before you hear that ‘whomp whomp whomp’ of rescue. People arriving at the scene might have a first aid kit… but there’s no mobile hospital out ‘there’… and only Hollywood brings a fully kitted Dr into the scenario at a critical moment. You and me? Probably die wishing. So?bring your own link. Bring your own best chance. Wear it. Charge it. And hope like all fuck you never need it.

It might be the best money you spend… ever. And really? It’s wonderful that you can use it to text out to people and to let them know you’re enjoying the hell out of your life. 

Cause that’s what we do..

 Adventure is going out there just to see what’s there. And the bikes we own get us there. I’ll wave as I go past. :)

Please make sure you come home. Give yourself the chance to wince and examine the bruises while you sip the last of a random joyful coffee… knowing you lived to tell the story.",6,1743157392.0,advrider,2,0.75,False
