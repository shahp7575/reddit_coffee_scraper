Off we go with our packed bags. Phone calls have been made, plans are in motion. After nine months of worry and stress, I was hit with a wave of excitement this morning when she woke me up.

I’m super excited to use it. Christmas Day will be chaotic with kids and hosting, and grocery stores won’t be open, yet I’d love to be able to make the perfect drinks on opening day which I realize might be a tall order as we navigate the new machine. At home we’ve literally only ever used a Kurig, (so talk me me like I’m 3) and I have a fancy machine at work that I avoided for far too long,  but colleagues have now trained me on what buttons exactly to press to make the perfect java however I don’t buy the ingredients or maintain that machine. So hit me up with what I need to know and have on hand for day 1 success! 

Day 1 orders:
- coffee
- tea
- cappacuino
- latte
- hot chocolate with frothed milk
-any other recommended favourites
 
Day 2: 
+ Espresso martini

Always: My Xmas eve guests would ordinarily request decaf, so if there’s a way to do decaf while also using the machine with regular beans I’d love to know. 

I love in the gta, bean recommendations accepted.

It’s not the big life stuff, those feel somewhat straightforward, but the little things. Like deciding what to cook, which route to take to work, or even which chair to sit in at a cafe. Somehow, every tiny choice spirals into a mental debate that feels like I’m negotiating a UN treaty. Yesterday I was scrolling online for inspiration and somehow ended up on a site showing a full-scale hydraulic racing simulator. Absolutely no intention of buying one, it’s not even practical, but I found myself thinking about how much effort goes into designing those things. Then I blinked and I was reading factory specifications on Alibaba for parts that probably cost less than my morning coffee. My brain apparently loves jumping to extremes. It made me realize that maybe this overthinking habit is just my mind trying to simulate every possible scenario before making a move, even when it’s unnecessary. I’m trying to catch myself and just pick something. Anything. Like choosing the first item on the menu instead of scrolling endlessly. It’s a small step, but it feels like a big one. Does anyone else get caught in this loop of over-preparing for minor stuffHow do you snap out of it without feeling guilty for not considering every angle?",1,1765714442.0,NoOverthinking,0,1.0,False

**Accessing...**



A lone streetlamp hangs above my head, twisted and mangled. the high-rises nothing more than rubble that forms a sea of destruction. A moon that is split in half hangs in the night sky, and said sky is colourfully filled with shooting stars of earths valiant defenders. I stand in a crowd of oily apparitions that walk about continuing their lives that are already gone; but only two of those figures matter to me. Standing in what remains of a playground, a woman with her son; ***our son***. Counting down a game of hide and seek.



Ten.

Nine.

*Wait*.

Eight.

Seven.

*Hold up a-*.

Six.

Five.

*Don't leave.*

Four.

Three.

*I'm sorry*.

Two.

One.



***Wake up.***



Air rushes my lungs as I shoot up from my sofa. Eyes warily scan the room before me, messy kitchenette, wobbly coffee table, mould that looks like a smiley face. Yep, just a nightmare; my breathing slows as the fear leaves my system. I rub my face as if to remove it from my mind, but I'm not so lucky. I swing my legs of the sofa and make contact with the floor; rising unceremoniously off the sofa. *Haven't had that nightmare in a while*. I reach for my holopad, one of two possessions that I have managed to leave earth with.



**10:49**. The numbers shine brightly from the pad. Well, enough time to make breakfast. I shamble my way over to the kitchenette, reaching to open the fridge. And there was the second of my two possession. A half-dozen carton of eggs that has been whittled down to one egg. The UN soldier that searched my things when I arrived here, found it, shook his head disapprovingly, and promptly hid it back with my refugee kit and moved me along. Good times, living in ruined hospitals that smelled like bleach and piss; coated in a fresh layer of paint and the refugee centre sign misspelled on the front for their human occupants. But at least the company was friendly enough.



I start to whip up a meal for a king. Fried rice with garlic paste for flavour, mixed with chopped green beans and carrots, and adorned with the last egg that I own. Well, as kingly as slumming it up on Venlil Prime can be. It only takes about thirty minutes to prepare, and only six minutes to devour. Simple and delicious, I place the bowl with the pile I neglect to clean. And check the time again. **11:24**.



*If I leave now I'll be making good time*. Even back on earth I was vehemently on-time, no matter the occasion, it was so bad that most people knew something was up if I was late. I amble my way over to the bathroom to collect my mask from last night and look into it; the reflection of a disheveled man stares back at me. I hate these masks but maybe they do a little good. I place the mask over my visage and stare into the mirror. ""Looking good, sunshine."" I say to the reflection while shooting it the double finger guns.



A sigh escapes my lips as I realise how stupid that was. With slumped shoulders I make my way to the front door, open, and make my way out. Locking it as I turn to my right and notice the venlil that I helped yesterday at their door doing the same looking at me.



""Good morning."" I say aloud.



""M-morning?"" They question.



*Ah, Shit* ""Sorry, I meant waking"" I correct as I curse myself for not reading the info dump about the venlil.



""Oh, good w-waking to you too."" the tip of their tail flicks up like I have any idea what that means.



...



...



...



*God, this is awkward.*



""Well... I better get going."" I say as I shuffle towards the main entrance.



""W-wait!"" *Haaa... what now?*



""Can I ask what y-your name is?"" Now that stopped me.



I shift my head to regard them. ""It's Thomas, Thomas McMahon.""



""Y-you have two names?"" They ask incredulous.



""Yeah, Pretty standard for us. What about you?""



""O-oh most sapients only have one name"" *How the hell do their postal services work?*



""So, what's your name?"" I ask with genuine curiosity.



""I-it's Sovah, I know it's a bit of an older name.""



""Well, it's is nice to make your acquaintance, Sovah"" their tail wags slightly. That I can understand.



""Y-yes, it's nice to make your acquaintance too.""



""But I really did mean when I said I have to get going."" I continue to the entrance ""so I'll see you around.""



""O-okay have a good paw!"" Again, I need to read that infodump.



The buildings main doors close with a thud. That was the weirdest encounter I've ever had with a venlil, and the nicest. The first time one has ever made an attempt to talk to me; I can't help but smile under the mask. Maybe this day won't be so bad. Celebratory egg, a halfway decent introduction and a possible visit with the HF smuggler for some meat. I just need to do this job.



And the walk to the bar was uneventful, besides a venlil almost being ran over by a car running from me. that was... a bit disconcerting; not the first time this has happen. But, just because they hate me doesn't mean I want them to be hurt. I couldn't even help them without getting more people hurt in the process. They would only stampede further and all that would be left is a pile of ash when the exterminators eventually turn up.



And the all too familiar blue doors of the ""whiskey business"" bestow their beauty upon my eyes. And as I open the doors to a packed bar. The one month and ten day anniversary of the battle of earth. Couldn't have it on the month due to the exterminator crackdown on human crowds gatherings, the last shrine was burnt down. I'm glad I wasn't there for that one. I shudder from what I heard they did that day.



A memorial shrine stands in the opposite wall of the room but still front and centre so that you know. I've already left the photo I want displayed with Priya, it's too hard to do it myself. And the band snaps me to reality with their song.



[""We'll meet again.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nzy1cfnKh4)



""Don't know where, don't know when.""



""But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.""



""Keep smiling through.""



""Just like you always do.""



""'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away.""



And that's when Bruce shoulder checks me from my trance and as I regard the drunken stance and slurring aussie I hear.



""I heard they made you a member."" The alcohol radiates from his lips like nerve gas.



""Yeah, they did Bruce."" *I really don't want to keep talking to him.*



""They did it yesterday."" I quickly tack on.



""Well, that was a fucking mistake wasn't it."" the rhetorical question comes back.



""Excuse me?""



""You 'eard me"" he dribbles out.



""A fucking mistake, you don't have the boogalahs for this."" My translator failed at this point; but I can infer the meaning.



""Look, what's your problem with me."" I ask tersely.



""My problem."" he snaps.



""I ain't got no problem."" He shunts me as he moves over to his table and takes a seat.



He begins to start singing along poorly with the song as the rest of the radicalist crowd begin to join in.



**""We'll meet again.""**



**""Don't know where, don't know when.""**



**""But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.""**



**""Keep smiling through.""**



**""Just like you always do.""**



**""'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away.""**



What would be normally a moment of solidarity and sorrow, is tainted by the undercurrent of revanchism. I quickly leave the scene and move to the bar and towards Priya. Hoping a sane voice would keep me from losing my mind.



And there she is. Working hard to keep the influx of new patrons quenched, fed and heard, and she's damn good at this job; she's possibly also the best recruiter for HF. What with all the little extra things she works on, like volunteering her time at the refugee centre and setting up events for them. Just like this one.



I perch myself on a stool as she finishes with a customer.



""Busy?"" I ask jokingly.



""Oh, like you wouldn't believe."" her smile shines brightly.



""And ah... thanks for putting the photo up."" I quietly add.



""You know someday you have to talk about it."" she somberly notes.



""J-just not today."" My breathing grows deeper.



""Well, if you're not ready. How about I settle for this."" an old fashioned is sat in front of me.



""You know I have a job to do today."" I protest gently.



""I do. But it seems like you really need this. On the house."" She slides it over to me.



""But anymore is coming out of your wallet. One's for self medicating, anymore is just for fun"" she smiles softly.



Maybe not the best advice to give someone that's hurting alcohol. *But its not like I'm making this easy*. I take large gulp from my cup and the warmness moves down starting with my tongue and ending with my gut and all that's left is a warmth that sits like pool in my stomach and a tightness that happens every time I see the shrine.



""Thanks, Priya."" a tightness rises in my throat.



""No need to thank me. Just make sure to do a good action for someone else. Okay?"" she coaxes gently.



""I promise, okay"". I accept her terms with heavy heart.



""Thank you Thomas, but I think Bradley would like to see you now."" she reminds me delicately.



""Ah, shit."" I blurted as I rise from my stool.



""See you around, Tommy."" She smiles the calming smile that she wields like a sceptre that banishes sorrow.



I give a quick wave to Priya as I rush my way to the back corridor and to my obligation. a door that hides the boss man and his machinations, and take a deep breath as I check the time. **12:59**. Well, I did say on the dot. I wait the agonising minute in silence, as I calm myself down. And when the minute ticks down; it's now or never I knock on the door.



""Enter."" I open the door and see Bradley at his desk, paper work scattered like a storm was let loose on his desk. I move towards the seat and take my place.



He looks up to me and back to his holopad ""You were not lying when you said 'on the dot'."" he quips with a grin.



""But, lets get down to brass tacks."" his demeanor shifted.



""Now."" he looks me dead in the eyes.



""This is the last time you can back out. And I want you to fully understand what I'm saying."" he continues.



""You can't get cold feet after this and you can't quit. You're either in or your out."" 



""And this is your initiation. And you're gonna have to do some unsavoury things whether you like it or not.""



""So, last chance. Are you in or are you out?"" he questions with finality.



*No, I'm not backing down this time* ""I'm in."" I return a steely gaze.



""Good, I'm glad that you aren't gonna run now."" a small grin spreads on his face before fading.



""The job requires you to tail an exterminator."" he states matter of factly.



""W-wait, really."" I balk at the request.



""Yes, really."" he asserts with authority.



""I'm sorta y'know."" I wave my hand, gesturing to my unfortunate situation of being human.



""We know, we're not fucking stupid!"" I quiet down at his outburst.



""You're going to meet up with an informant of ours, he knows more in particular on this firebug."" he continues on.



""Lives on twelve sunny grain way in the basement level."" *Wow, I knew venlil weren't creative considering ""Venlil Prime"" but really?*



""And he is paranoid as well. So you'll need to know his password."" *password, really? like a spy movie.*



""When the prey leaves the herd.""



""You will reply with 'the shadestalker takes their chance' understood.""



""yes, sir. But I've got ask why am I stalking a exterminator?"" *I've* ***really*** *got to ask.*



""Well, I shouldn't tell you. But, our last contact within the guild has gone dark."" My face doesn't betray the shock of existence of exterminator contacts.



""We don't know if he has died or if he just bounced. But we need a new asset inside the guild.""



""And our informant believes that he has found just the replacement. And that he needs a little 'persuasion'.""



""That is where you come in. I don't know the full details, that's for our informant to tell you.""



""So, you've got all that?"" He finishes on that note.



""I believe so, sir."" I answer.



""Well, then get the fuck to work."" I jump out of my seat as fast as I can and make my way to the door.



""Oh, and one more thing."" I stop in my tracks.



""Don't get yourself killed."" he adds with a reserved kindness.



""Yes, sir.""



I step out and closed the door and breathe a sigh of relief. ""What have I got myself into?"" I say to no-one. I move with renewed vigour down the corridor and back through the bar, purposefully ignoring the shrine. As I make it to the blue double doors, I put on my mask and look at my holopad and punch in the address and it shows a route to twelve sunny grain way. In another half-neglected building about twenty minutes walk back towards my home.



*Well, at least it ain't that far*. I begin my march towards uncertainty, and as the buildings past I can only reflect on the job, the passcode, and the general sense of uneasiness I have. *If I screw this up, I'm done for*. But I shake that thought as the building comes into view, same standard design that my apartment building has; only with a few less cracks. and I mean only a few, its still in the same rough shape as mine.



I proceed through the squeaky entrance and make my way to stairs and down into the basement level. and god does it stink, I wish I could cover my nose but this mask makes that difficult. The source of the smell is soon revealed; a leaky pipe that's dripping down onto a corner with a pile of garbage building up in the communal trash room.



*Just ignore it*. Is what my mind says, but my gut says vomit. I walk over to the informants apartment, moving past the trash room as I knock on the door. I wait for a minute as I hear the shuffling inside the apartment move closer to me and through the door a muffled voice speaks.



""When the prey leaves the herd.""



""The..."" *Fuck, I've forgotten.*



""When the prey leaves the herd."" The voice becomes a bit more agitated.



""The... shadestalker."" *That's it.*



""The shadestalker takes their chance.""



I hear deadbolts, chains and even a what sounds like a makeshift alarm system, clatter and thud as they are systematically undone. and the door slowly creaks open to reveal.



...

I’m buying a manual grinder to use “Exclusively” with an AeroPress.

I’m not planning to use this grinder for espresso or other brew methods, so it doesn’t need to be super versatile beyond the Aeropress range/requirements.

(“But good cup quality and reliable grind adjustment are important.”)

Not necessarily but also include some “Good” grinder options that can fit in plunger of the aeropress.

Six months ago, I had this frustrating realization during a long commute ""Why am I not reading more when I have two hours a day doing nothing?""

That thought became Dialogue an app that turns books into podcast-style conversations:

* Listen to books explained through natural dialogue between two voices
* Get through your reading list during commutes, workouts, or chores
* Actually retain information because it feels like listening to a conversation, not a lecture

I had spent 10+ years as a Tech Lead at Google, but building a consumer product solo was completely different. I rewrote the voice generation three times. The first version sounded robotic and lifeless.

But after months of iteration and way too much coffee... it's live.

I'm not expecting it to change the world or anything, but I'm genuinely proud it exists. If it helps even one person actually finish books they've been meaning to read that's enough.

I’m 23F. At 1 month postpartum, I had my first gallbladder attack and was able to have it out at 3 months postpartum. I felt pretty good after the surgery, but I also felt like I didn’t really have a choice. I had a very small, dependent baby and wanted to be able to address my health issues, so I could be fully present with her. I was afraid to eat and felt like I couldn’t wait much longer. I know some people on here have had to wait much longer, so perhaps I shouldn’t complain. It just felt like a rushed decision. 

Everything was going well until about a month ago (4 months post-op). Every morning I have painful cramping and loose stools, despite still eating mostly low-fat. I also have been experiencing urgency, which is so awful. I don’t drink coffee or alcohol anymore. It feels debilitating because I cannot leave the house in the morning. It’s embarrassing. I started taking 2g of psyllium husk before breakfast and 1g before lunch. I so far haven’t noticed too much of a difference but it has only been about 5 days of this regimen.

Imagine how much impact shit like tiktok has on people. Extended periods of excessive dopamine stimulation on useless information that doesn't get processed fully. Interesting theory right?

Well, after my dopamine was depleted, i took a break from tiktok because of how boring it felt. When i came back i looked at the comments of each video and realised how much it's just ruining the world.

Each comment is a copy of the one above, but everyone thinks theyre onto something because they absorbed some false information 20 scrolls ago.

Everyone's thinks they're being smart and standing out, but each comment is just the same statement which in theory does sound pretty smart, until you find the same statement repeated 500 times across the comment section, the further you scroll down, the falser the statement gets.

A fucked up game of telephone because the information was only half-absorbed in a rapid spike of dopamine during a doomscroll binge.


It's full of people misusing complex terms, trying to self diagnose (and saying the stupidest shit ever), trying to seem smart/superior by spreading the information they misinterpreted.

I mean, one of the videos was about how cats see humans as bigger cats, and the ONLY TWO statements made were:

1. That theory is false, they percieve us normally.

2. The image of the cat's perception came out wrong.


EVERY SINGLE GODDAMN COMMENT SAID:

""Wait, so my cat sees my like a tiger?""

""Omg so they see me as one of them🥹🥹""

""Cat's vision can't be that blurry, they hunt rodents.""

Well, after my dopamine was depleted, i took a break from tiktok because of how boring it felt. When i came back i looked at the comments of each video and realised how much it's just ruining the world.

Each comment is a copy of the one above, but everyone thinks theyre onto something because they absorbed some false information 20 scrolls ago.

Everyone's thinks they're being smart and standing out, but each comment is just the same statement which in theory does sound pretty smart, until you find the same statement repeated 500 times across the comment section, the further you scroll down, the falser the statement gets.

A fucked up game of telephone because the information was only half-absorbed in a rapid spike of dopamine during a doomscroll binge.


It's full of people misusing complex terms, trying to self diagnose (and saying the stupidest shit ever), trying to seem smart/superior by spreading the information they misinterpreted.

I mean, one of the videos was about how cats see humans as bigger cats, and the ONLY TWO statements made were:

1. That theory is false, they percieve us normally.

2. The image of the cat's perception came out wrong.


EVERY SINGLE GODDAMN COMMENT SAID:

""Wait, so my cat sees my like a tiger?""

""Omg so they see me as one of them🥹🥹""

""Cat's vision can't be that blurry, they hunt rodents.""


THATS JUST ONE SMALL, EASY TO COMPREHEND EXAMPLE. THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE TS HAS. NOT JUST TIKTOK, OUR PARENTS DOOMSCROLL FACEBOOK OR READ NEWSPAPERS THE SAME WAY THIS GENERATION WATCHES TIKTOK. 

LITERALLY IMAGINE HOW MESSED UP THE WORLD COULD BE.... WHAT IF THE DOPAMINE STIMULATION (SHORT BURSFS OF FOCUS IN WHICH THE BRAIN IS SUPPOSED TO BE LEARNING & ADAPTING) IS CAUSING WORLD-WIDE PSYCHOSIS & DELUSION BECAUSE NONE OF IT IS BEING ABSORBED PROPERLY BECAUSE OF EITHER OVERSTIMULATION, OR NOT ENOUGH TIME SPENT ACTUALLY  STUDYING OR PROPERLY COMPREHENDING THE INFORMATION PERCIEVED???

WHAT IF NOBODY IS NOTICING BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS A TAILORED FYP? A LOCAL NEWSPAPER WITH KEYWORDS THAT WE RECOGNISE AND AGREE ON EVEN THOUGH WITHIN, WE HAVE DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS OF SAID TOPIC?

1pmcf9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantAndVentPH/comments/1pmcf9p/my_piece_of_shit_lead_chef/,My Piece of shit “lead chef”,"I work at a fine dining restaurant as a line cook. Ive worked here for almost 10 months and I’ve experienced a lot but i learned a lot and gotten very far through hard work and tenacity and always being able to adapt through all the thick and thin in the kitchen. Today was another experience for me. I work with another coworker with years beyond me in the kitchen, we’ll just call him “the lead”. He’s not actually a lead in the kitchen but he might as well be with his experience but there are many who are lead chefs. He’s very tough and knows the ins and outs of the kitchen and everything in between and I’ve come to respect him for everything he does. Recently I’ve had the pleasure of working alongside him in the same station, the sauté station. This is a very tough station to work at and asks for a lot but I feel I’ve been able to manage and actually excel on sauté but of course I’m not perfect but it feels as though “the lead” expects me to and not the way you may think. Today when I opened I prepped as much as I can even to the last minute to make sure everything is ready for him for dinner service and I mean EVERYTHING. Unfortunately I couldn’t do everything cause I had to make family meal for all staff in the restaurant. (If you don’t know what family meal is plz look it cause I’m not gonna explain it) today was my turn but I had to do it by my self which was a lot but doable. A lot of people gave props and kudos cause I was able to do family meal myself which isn’t a very easy thing to do except for “the lead”. Instead he actually mentioned how another coworker of mine told me how bad I was at cooking which isn’t a bad thing cause I always accept criticism but it was just weird how he had to mention that.

This is where it gets interesting. Dinner service starts and instead of helping me he decides to clean the entire lowboy of the pastry station. Random but ok I don’t mind he’s closing and I’m not staying long so idc. When he finishes in like 30 min he comes back to the sauté station and joins me but he’s not really with me it feels as though he’s against me. He starts calling me out on all the little things, like if I left my station a little messy, I forgot to set up a plate or I dropped a glove on the floor. It feels as though it doesn’t matter if I was the best or the absolute worst, he was gonna call me out on everything I did wrong. It’s annoying and I do everything I can do right but it’s all for moot. Tensions are rising more and more and it seems as though he’s getting more and more frustrated at me and I couldn’t figure out why. For example we have a big pot full of boiling water for our edamame we serve and we have to constantly refill it since the water is constantly evaporating and when I tried to refill it he just thru a tantrum and got mad at me. It felt like walking on eggshells trying to work on the station with him and it got to a point where I was basically doing nothing and just watching him do everything during service. It was torture and all I wanted to do was go home and be done with it but our sous chef wouldn’t let me and just told me to go back to work. Things only got worse from there because I was cleaning our knives on our station, (both mine and his just were just sitting on the cutting board) and I guess I may have grazed the tip his knife against the edge of container on our station and that just did it for him. I didn’t do it on purpose of course but He not only called me out on it but accused me of destroying his knife and when I questioned what I did (cause i genuinely didn’t know I hit his knife against anything) he just grabbed his knife and reenacted what I did but actually bang his knife against the container on purpose only causing “more damage”. When I tried to send him on his ten min break he wouldn’t go cause he thought I would only cause more damage to his stuff when I’m not trying to do that at all. I had to get out of there and went downstairs to plead with my sous chef to let me go home cause I can’t stand this but again he just sent me back upstairs to work and to work it out with him. I go back and he had to fill up sauces in the back for some reason so he disappeared and I finally have the station to myself but when he returns he acts as though nothing even happened and even offered to get me coffee for the next day but I refused cause I want nothing from him and that’s when I was finally let go by my sous chef.

The thing that bothers me is the fact that I actually thought “the lead” could actually be my friend but he’s just a piece of bipolar shit. We’ve had really good times in the kitchen when we could work together and laugh and make jokes. He’s actually taught me lot when I first started and I took a lot of what he said seriously. there have been times when we’ve gone out to work parties together and have good times together. I even thought he might even make a good drinking partner cause this fool drinks almost as much as I can. I guess it hurts when he treated me this way for absolutely no reason and even if I try to ask why he wouldn’t tell cause he’s such a bad communicator. I’ve always known he’s been a piece of shit at work cause I’ve seen him act this way to others in the kitchen but I guess I never thought he’d treat me this way since I’ve never given him a reason to but to him it doesn’t matter.

At this point I’ve decided he’s just an acquaintance at work. There’s nothing to discuss other than work for him. If we’re working the same station together or not there’s nothing to discuss other than work. He has something to tell me about his personal life, sorry but I don’t give a crap. You’re just another face I have to look at work and that’s that. We have to see each other at another work party? I’ll just enjoy my company with everyone else but you.

Need outside perspective,"I (F27) started seeing a guy (M26) I met on Hinge. I’ve been single for over a year after a 5-year relationship and I’m trying to do things differently this time. Go slow and actually get to know someone values and objetives like children. This is also the first time I’ve dated someone younger, so I’m not sure if this is immaturity or just very different pacing.

We started talking while I was traveling for 3 weeks. The chats were fun, but he texted a lot, even when I wasn’t replying (time zone difference + vacation). He kept texting and texting about his day or what he was doing, and sometimes he would asked me “where are you?”. Eventually he asked what I was looking for, I said I want a relationship but slowly, and that texting isn’t really how I bond. He agreed.

When I got back, he wanted to pick me up from the airport at 5am after a long flight. I said no, but he still really wanted to see me that day, so I invited for coffee at my place. I was super tired so I didn't want to go out, and I have a male flatmate, so I thought it was safe enough. I told him before that I didn’t want to rush into anything physical, he agreed and while here he didn't try. He only kissed me to say goodbye. But he showed up with gifts like chocolate.

Since then (less than a week):

* He’s wanted to see me every day (I’ve seen him 3 times already)
* He calls randomly
* He texts a lot even when I don't reply he keeps sending me pictures and telling me things about his day
* Conversations are nice, just very intense for someone I barely know

It feels like in his head we’re already “something” while for me this is still very early. I don’t think he’s a bad guy, he’s sweet and I enjoy talking to him, but I feel overwhelmed and pressured.

(pics),"Hey everyone, I just got an AGARO drip coffee maker and I am using it for the first time. I want to get the best coffee this machine is capable of, not just a passable cup.

My setup:

\- Basic AGARO drip machine (glass carafe, warming plate)

\- Reusable metal mesh filter

\- Pre ground coffee (Ainmane, medium roast, chocolate note)

\- Using the scoop that came with the machine

I will attach pics of the machine, the filter basket, the coffee bag, the grind, and the cup I brewed.

What I am looking for:

\- Your best practices for getting great tasting drip coffee on a simple machine like this

\- Any technique tips that matter most (dose, bed leveling, bloom pause, water quality, cleaning, hot plate usage)

\- Anything to avoid that commonly ruins taste on these machines

If you had this exact setup, what would your default recipe and routine be to consistently get a clean, strong, smooth cup?",5,1765712975.0,IndiaCoffee,5,1.0,False

He said he doesn't want to have sex with her, isn't attracted to her and loves her but is not in love anymore. She is a stay at home dog mom and loves her life with him.

He cheated on her for over a year (with a newly divorced woman), apparently because his long term partner gained weight. They are both very sexual people and the long term partner blames herself for him cheating. She was addicted to painkillers and was acting weird on them he said. She said they made her gain weight and lose her libido. 

They had a deal she wouldn't do them. She quit the painkillers in Jan, lost almost all the weight now, but he carried on with the cheating until Sept when the mistress told her. He had told the mistress he wasn't having sex at home so she was pissed that he was having sex with both. He dumped the mistress obviously for betraying him even though he was lying to both women.

He tried to control the narrative but the mistress sent screen shots to the long term to prove her point.

He still tried being sexual with the mistress after being caught mid Sept, even though he was pissed about the betrayal. LT caught them chatting on instagram (Nov 11) and he ended things again with the side piece. Side piece gave him a b.j. Nov 10.

Yesterday he met with the side piece outside a coffee shop at her request. He could have said no. He yelled and said to leave him alone. She betrayed him and if she doesn't leave his truck he will call the police.

Should LT know that he was intimate with side piece again? He said he misses having sex with her and was trying to open up his relationship so he could do it all without lying to anyone or sneaking around. LT didn't want that. 

He told LT he was being honest and she believes him. (2 months after getting caught he asked for and got a b.j. It's adding fuel to the fire though. He said it would just be rubbing her nose in it and she isn't leaving him no matter what. Does she have a right to know that last detail?)

i am also lazy. i don't take notes. instead, i sit in the front row and run this site called scriptivox on my laptop. it records the audio and transcribes it into text.

**the event:** tuesday's lecture ends. i see Sarah organizing papers at the front. i decide this is the day. i’m going to shoot my shot.

i walk up to the podium. i am nervous. i am sweating. i start chatting her up. i thought it was going well. i asked her if she wanted to grab coffee at the campus starbucks to ""discuss the reading.""

she looked me dead in the eye and said, very loudly, ""OP, i am a grad student. i don't date undergrads. and please stop staring at me during the lecture, it’s noticeable.""

i mumbled an apology, grabbed my bag, and power-walked out of there. humiliation level: 9/10.

**the fuck up:** i got back to my dorm. i completely forgot that stupid site had been running the entire time. i didn't check the end of the file.

someone in the class Discord asked, ""Hey, did anyone get the notes for the last 20 mins? I fell asleep.""

trying to be the cool, helpful guy (and redeem my ego), i exported the transcript and dropped the file into the #general chat. ""Got you covered bro,"" i typed.

**the fallout:** about an hour later, the notifications started blowing up.

* *""OP... did you really ask her out?""*
* *""LMAO check line 450.""*
* *""RIP to our fallen soldier.""*

I regularly switch between making aeropress, oxo soup and espresso (picopresso), and also swap between dark/light roasts pretty often.

From what I’ve found so far, my options are

Option 1. DF83v (not sure what burrs to get) : Seems great all round but a lot of reviews mention the motor potentially jamming for some people. I get 100V 50Hz power here so a bit more worried about motor shenanigans. I’m considering getting a 220V unit and a transformer to avoid issues. Has anyone tried this? Would be buying from df64coffee dotcom. Anyone have experience with their customer service etc?

Option 2. Timemore 078 : Very well regarded for filter, can do soup (?) but can’t grind fine enough for espresso. Is 800$ though so I can spend the other 200$ on something like a K/J-ultra for espresso, which gives me a great travel grinder too. Maybe even experiment with the millab m01 and its weird pineapple burrs.

Option 3. Varia VS6 : Generally pretty interesting, but not sure if the reviews I found are trustworthy. Not interested in the cone burr options at all (hand grinder + drill ftw) and the burrs I want to try (gold SSP MP clones) are out of stock. Kinda unsure about committing to varias proprietary platform. 

Option 4. Some 64mm from DF (CF64V?) plus a bunch of different burrs to play around with.

Now, first off, I totally get why people become convinced this combination does something. We like sensory feedback, so all that fizzing and bubbling feels like something is really happening. 

Something is happening, but just not what you like to think. 

Vinegar is an acid and baking soda is a base. When you mix an acid and base, they react, neutralize each other and in this case produces a gaseous by product. The key here is the  two things react with *each other,* not the dirt you put them on, and the result cancels out the best cleaning power of the separate ingredients. All you get is vaguely salty water, which is roughly as good a cleaner as plain water. 

""But wait,"" you say, ""I/somebody I know/somebody on the internet has successfully clean something with vinegar and baking soda together! Suck it, naysayer!""

Yeah, and I once cleaned permanent marker off a dry erase board with vending machine coffee. Just because it worked doesn't mean I was making the right choices. 

I'm going to break down one specific example of a poster who claimed to have proof vinegar and baking soda cleared their blocked drain. They poured vinegar down, waited, then poured baking soda down, waited, then poured boiling water down. Gradually, the drain cleared up as calcium deposits gradually broke down.

What really happened here is that the vinegar, being acidic, had time to work on the calcium deposits unit having baking soda dumped on it and stopping that process in its tracks by neutralizing its acidity. The whole thing worked because the vinegar was given time to work alone, but it most likely would have worked better if baking soda had been removed from the equation entirely. 

The only argument for using vinegar and baking soda in cleaning is where the mechanical action of expanding gasses might in some way assist the process, but the use cases severely limited and questionable. 

In a drain, you'd have to form an absolutely airtight seal to even imagine the gas pressure might do something and even it did work, pushing a clog farther down the pipe is of very dubious worth. 

On surface grime, anything loose enough to be effectively lifted by gas bubbles is probably faster and more easily removed just by scrubbing it. 

Vinegar and baking soda can be fantastically useful cleaning products, separately. Don't ruin them by putting them together, unless it's a science fair volcano. There, the combo has always shone. ",141,1765711693.0,CleaningTips,14,0.94,False

1pmbvh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1pmbvh8/too_petty_for_asking_my_roommate_to_not_use_my/,Too petty for asking my roommate to not use my espresso machine or not??,"TL;DR: I shared my espresso machine and beans with my roommate. While I was away for two weeks due to a family death, he used almost all my beans. Since then, he’s repeatedly pushed shared costs in ways that benefit him, argued against me switching to decaf, bought way pricier beans without asking and asked me to split them, and at one point hid the pricier beans instead of keeping them in our shared coffee area. Right before I left for another trip, he suddenly put the pricier beans back into the hopper. Got gifted a bunch of boutique pricey beans for early christmas and don’t feel like sharing with him or charging him things I got for free. After all this, I asked him to stop using my espresso machine and beans. Now I’m wondering if I’m being petty or overthinking it.

Full post: When my roommate and I moved in together, I was happy to share my espresso machine. When he first saw it, he made a snarky comment like, “You know our building has a Nespresso machine with free pods, right? I’d never buy something like this.” I still told him he could use mine. He replied, “I’d never use it,” in a sarcastic way.

I moved in with the hopper full of beans. The very next day, I had to leave town for two weeks because my grandma passed away. While I was gone, he used almost all of my beans. When I got back, there was enough left for one espresso.

Before I got home, he texted me asking what beans I buy and said he wanted to replace them. But once I was back, he asked me to go buy more beans since he doesn’t have a car and said we could split the cost. He never offered to replace the full hopper himself, just to split it once I handled the errand.

I finished the last espresso and bought more beans. The following week, he went out and bought very expensive beans without asking me first and then asked me to split the cost. I didn’t really mind and paid my share.

I’ve been having trouble sleeping, and during a conversation I mentioned that I might switch to decaf beans. He pushed back and said he felt he’d be “getting less value” if we paid the same price for decaf. The next day, he bought a huge bag of regular beans.

Again, I didn’t make it an issue. We finished the nicer beans and then moved on to cheaper Costco beans. For context, we actually have a designated area where we keep our regular/shared coffee beans.

One day, I opened a cabinet farther away where I keep my dry goods and noticed it smelled like coffee. I found the nicer beans hidden behind his large bag of rice and other dried goods. This really threw me off, because we already have a normal spot for coffee.

What bothered me is that he knows I travel to visit family during holidays. It made me feel like he was saving the nicer beans for when I wasn’t around. The money itself wasn’t a big deal, it was around $20, but the hiding made me rethink the earlier situations with the beans and the decaf argument. I did ask him if there were any beans left, and he casually said he found “some leftovers.”

About a week before winter break, he kept asking me when my flight was. The day before I left, he finally put the nicer beans into the hopper, mixing them with other beans.

Recently, my boyfriend gave me several pricey boutique coffee beans as an early Christmas gift. I feel uncomfortable sharing them. I didn’t pay for them, and I also don’t feel right charging my roommate for something I got for free. At the same time, given the previous annoyance incidents I don’t want to be sharing these beans with him for free either.

Because of all this, I asked my roommate to stop using my espresso machine and my beans going forward.

But now I’m second guessing myself. Am I just being petty? Am I imagining that he was hiding the beans on purpose? Am I overthinking this in my head and making it into something bigger than it is? ",5,1765711538.0,badroommates,8,0.86,False

1pmbtw1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmbtw1,That Moment in Books When the Big Boss Gives an Employee a Ride Home,"One of the sweetest moments in classic romance and MM romance is when the big boss gives an employee a ride home — and the rest of the company, the whole team, watches it happen and secretly burns with envy.

Let’s be honest: I love this moment too. That’s why it shows up in every single one of my books. Especially in this one.

It’s impossible to resist using scenes like this in a romantic plot. Skipping them feels like drinking bitter coffee without a piece of chocolate, eating caramel without salt, or working while you’re supposed to be on vacation.

So what do you think? I’m genuinely curious about your opinion. Drop it in the comments — I’m planning to start writing my 51st book soon, and part of me thinks it might be time to change something radically… but then again.

Any ideas?,"To answer the common questions: My name is Chris, Her name is Charlie. No we don't heal fast. Yes we feel pain. Neither of us can figure out how it happened, (believe me we've tried), and we aren't really sure what to do. This isn't the only place this is being posted, we figure the more creative eyes that might see it the better idea we can figure for what's going on.   

Before we realized what happened, we were (and still kind of are) relatively ""normal"". I had a job at a major grocery story and she had one at a local coffee shop. We had a dog named Boxer that we loved very much, (guess how he got that name), and we hiked a lot. We had been together for some years nearing a decade. We've had more ups than downs and while we may have struggled financially here and there we always had our mind set that God would have us where we are meant to be. That said its not lost how fortunate we are to have had the life we've had so far. And we can't wait to see what what the future has in store, especially now. 

Learning what what we now are was a serious trauma. Me, Charlie, and the Boxer were setting out to hike from the middle of the city where we live, to a major trail where there's woods for miles. City we live in is the type of place where the only people who know how to use a turn signal are the ones first getting their license. We were coming up to a 4 way stop and walking though it and for me that's where it goes black. One thing we both agree on though is that we didn't hear it but we sure felt it. From what investigators could gather, their best guess is that it was some idiot who fell asleep at the wheel. Instead of just veering off to the left or right, they slumped into the accelerator and came straight for us. We both were found with large gashes on our palms and cheeks. Besides that Charlie got it the worst. She was crushed up against the wall of a building. Her legs, spine, ribs, and vital organs were all crushed and shredded by the 2 ton death machine the world calls a car. I was smashed into and thrown back first to wrap around a telephone pole, cracking my skull in a way I still think I can feel sometimes. Our poor baby Boxer. He was torn up under the wheel. Barely more than a pink lumpy mess could be gathered from the crime scene once they could ID that it was canine flesh. 

I woke up weeks later and got caught up once they could send someone down to explain everything to me. I was devastated to learn what happened. They told me flat out, no sugarcoating or sparing my feelings. There was a terrible accident, my girlfriend and dog were dead, and I was lucky to be alive. My girlfriends body would be kept intact in the morgue until I was fit and able to make some decisions, and my dogs body could not be fully recovered. It felt like, well, getting hit by a truck, again. In a split second I went from a normal day on the street to losing everything I could think to care about. I slumped back into bed and gave up eating for days. 

They started me on a fluid regime to keep me alive in addition to the blood infusions. I thought I had fully given up when this voice I never heard came in my head. From what I remember, he said; ""Your time is not up. Rise. Your pain shall not be wasted."" Gotta be honest it. I didn't like it. Being so vague and nonspecific I could have done a lot with whatever it really said. However I took it as a sign to get myself moving again. Eventually I did. Sometimes there's that lazy part of my head that wishes I didn't. I noticed the blood was marked A positive. I knew this was wrong, my whole life I had been O negative. I called and asked a nurse, she assured me that I was tested when I arrived and the blood was a match for me. I asked for the papers and by goodness it was true. I had never heard of such a thing before but I guess anything is possible at this point.   

A doctor came in my room and told me I was getting miracle after miracle. He had seen the different injuries alone in several other people being enough to kill. Yet somehow I recovered almost seventy percent from the spine injury, and fully recovered from my skull fracture. Not only that, but the rate at which it was happening was faster than any other he'd ever seen. He wanted me to sign some papers to have tests done and see if they can use the results for major lifesaving stuff. He told me when I'm ready. I can walk across the floor and take a look at the papers, which he left on a small table next to the door. It took me a week of small incremental attempts but I finally got to them. What I saw hurt.   

There were so many forms to sign and fill out. Sitting on top were the worst ones. A death certificate and release of body form for my deceased girlfriend. With no parents or nearby family who could come by, it fell on me to fill it all out. I might be alive now, but I still feel a little dead inside from reading that. I called a nurse to have me rolled to the place they were keeping her. After the midday rush died down one was free to help me out. She radio'd down to let them know we would be there and brought me down. 

We went through several doors and long hallways. Many Lefts and Many Rights. We took an elevator down and after getting past the last door. The chill hit me. Both from the cold and the shock of what I saw. They were nice enough to have her out for when we got there. I rolled my chair over and stood up at the drawer she was laid on. Her skin was the same color it always had been. Her eyes were closed. It was like she was just sleeping. She could have just laid down for a nap as far as I could have known. They told me it was nearly instant. That she didn't feel a thing. I knew then and got confirmed now that's a load. I had to be sure she was gone. I put my ear to her chest and listened. I don't know for how long. Long enough for her skin to feel warm again. Long enough for the nurse to get chatter on her radio and ask ""you got this?"" to the gentleman who was manning the room. It wasn't days, but I stood and studied her until I felt I spent most of a day. Studying. Looking. Memorizing the face of the last woman I would ever say ""I love you"" to and still have that little feeling inside to prove to me I meant it. I took one more breath, I told her one last time, and I asked the guy if he could have someone come get me. I sat back down and waited in my chair. I didn't take my eyes off her until I felt the weight of sleep start to wrench my eyes. The last image I had of her was her laying on the drawer, her hair hanging off the edge and dangling in messy bunches. 

I woke up in my room still in my chair. I guess if I was in there it was close enough. I got into the hospital bed one last time and got all the paperwork taken care off. I took a second nap afterwards. It took what felt like a whole day of reading and writing, but it had to be done. Next day was my last day there. I guess even someone like me needs to be rushed out and moved along. 

I walking back home even from the bus station was filled with flashbacks and flinching but I did it. I had just gotten home. Barely sat down when I got the call. Charlie. The woman I had just signed to be taken care of. Woke. Up. The nurse on the phone almost frantic as I was told me there was banging on the door of the drawer nearly the same minute I left the hospital. I forgot everything including locking the door to the house. I ran to the hospital on foot I couldn't stand to be made to wait to see her. I burst through the door, checked in and lo and behold there she was. In the same room I was in was my beautiful lady. Just like the day before it happened and shining like the sun. The same doctor who was taking care of me had taken charge of her. She was hooked up to the same machines I was, and her initial injuries were showing healing, but she still had some time before they would let her leave. Strangely. She also had her blood type change. I know for a fact that she was A negative, and they were giving her B positive. I checked her papers too and it was the same thing as mine. I didn't make too much a deal about it at the time. I was just happy to have her back. We caught up and happily shredded those death papers. I went back to work and visited her every day until she was able to be discharged. 

So now here we are. Having gone through what he have, I know no matter what, with her at my side and I hers, there isn't much we have to be afraid of, and a whole world of time to spend. 

Some things we are wondering but not willing to try. Getting pulverized and dissolved in acid like in that Renfield movie. If we can come back from that it feels like a massive waste of time. Same thing as lobbing off limbs. I would consider it if there was some kind of benefit besides being some kind of infinite donor source, which to be honest might be useful but also I think there's better ways to spend this new thing about us. 

Right now we are just focused on getting by like everyone else. We have schoolwork to do and are also barely scraping by with the cost of everything. We do try to keep as low cost as we can but these times are really testing us personally. We miss our pup. We think about her all the time and we just can't bring another animal into our house. At least not so soon. Maybe with some more time. We have been trying to find ways to invest in things that we can have growing with us as time goes by. In the past when I think about this type of thing I always said I'd do this and that. Turns out all of those things are very hard to do but we are trying. Who knew you have to do more than want and learn about something. Crazy I know.  

It has been 5 years since what happened and we still look the exact same. I know 5 isn't too long but normally something has to be a little different, but no. She even has all the same silver hairs she had before the accident. I counted. That's something we noticed in the first year. The tub drain doesn't clog with our hair anymore. Normally I had to clean it almost every week, but now. Almost nothing. 

Thinking about what this could mean for us has been scratching my brain. We believe in God, and how Jesus died for our sins. What does that mean for us now unable to die? Are we barred from heaven? Maybe we still can die and we just need to reach a higher damage threshold before the healing can occur. Do we have a purpose that nobody else can do and so we are being set aside until that can happen? If so why us? Neither of us would say we are much too special. We do our best, and we aren't dirt bags. If its a part of a big plan where do we fit in it? I once heard it said that death is Gods gift to us. What does that mean if we can't die? Has that gift been revoked? What did we do wrong? Can we right the wrong we did? Are we dammed or separated from God? it doesn't feel that way. Our best guess is to keep doing what we can where we can and keep going no matter what. Just because there's no finish line doesn't mean it won't be a nice walk.      

Thank you if you took the time. I hope someday you die, and you leave things better than you found it. I guess that's the best any of us could really ask for.

About a month ago, I bought a Racer jacket in the Tobacco color (suede leather). It is a very nice looking jacket, although the brown is noticeably darker than what is shown in the photos. I also want to give a heads-up to Thursday for offering the jacket in three different fits: slim, athletic, and loose. I bought the athletic fit in size L, and it fits me perfectly.

My issue with this jacket is the smell. I know that every new leather jacket can smell a bit funky for a few days, but this one has had a very strong and unpleasant odor for almost a month after purchase.

I first aired it on the balcony for a few days and then wore it to the office. The smell was so bad that my coworkers actually asked me to hang the jacket outside the window. After that incident, I aired it on the balcony for almost a full week and even tried the coffee grounds trick I found online to absorb the smell. The situation improved somewhat, but the jacket still smells quite bad.

Now, almost a month has passed. The smell has subsided a bit, but it is still clearly noticeable and unpleasant.

I do not know what kind of chemicals were used in the production process, but this is completely unacceptable for a leather jacket at this price point. I would have returned it, but since I live outside the US, the shipping costs and the fact that I would not be able to reclaim the import taxes I paid made me keep it.

At the moment, the jacket is back on the balcony airing out. I hope the smell will eventually dissipate over time, but I wanted to leave a review since I could not do so on the Thursday Boot website.",1,1765711174.0,ThursdayBoot,0,1.0,False

I can send a pic if you’re interested but description wise I’m 5 10, short brown hair, medium build. I like to read, go to the movies, started working out recently, and i like going for walks around the city. I’m a sociable, funny guy (I think lol) happy to chat and see if we’re a good match!

An odder type of post on here but if you’re interested let me know!

Hi! I am looking for new people to become friends with. Medyo boring and lonely ang life ko lately so why not socialize a lil bit and share a few hours of my life with someone new? I prefer hanging out to calls and chatting! 

about me:
28, 5'11, introvert, working, I don't drink, I don't smoke, single

I love traveling. I've been to Cebu, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and hopefully next year sa Japan with friends. I love listening to music and playing guitar. Sendan kita ng covers jk. I love movies about life, love, relationships, romcom, or anything I find interesting. I tried canyoneering, whale diving, and other outdoor stuff and surprisingly I enjoyed them. 

I am a nerd when it comes to technology. I love taking pictures of places I've been. I love romanticizing road trips, city lights. I recently started running every weekend morning. I'm not that maligalig type of person but I guess it depends on the chemistry. I almost forgot the most important thing, I love iced coffee. I oftentimes think out loud. Observing and learning my surroundings and the people around me.

1pmbltl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1pmbltl/isrib_a15_experience_6_weeks_update/,ISRIB A15 experience: 6 weeks update,"I was working in startup for 3 years, basically burning myself out completely. Long story. Too much stress, not enough sleep, cognitive decline that I couldn't fix with just rest. I've tried Modafinil, it helped for work but made me anxious and sleep was terrible. Coffee just made things worse, more jittery feeling but no real clarity. Ice bath worked good, but the effect was temporary and not sustainable.

Around 6 weeks ago I decided to try ISRIB A15. Started with 10 mg in morning onempty stomach. First few days nothing really happened. But around day 4-5, something changed. Not like energy boost, more like brain fog started to lift slowly. I could think more clearly during meetings, didn't feel that constant mental fatigue.

But I must say that this NOT magic solution that fixes everything. My friend tried it, he said he doesn't feel much difference. It appears that ISRIB works better when brain experienced chronic stress or some injury. If your brain works properly, probably Modafinil or even coffee would make more sense for you.

What I noticed most - I can work for longer periods without that mental crash. Before ISRIB A15, after 2-3 hours of coding I was completely exhausted mentally. It was like really hard to sustain my focus and I always ended up scrolling Tik Tok. Now I can go 4-5 hours and still feel relatively clear, like all distractions gone away. Sleep also became better, deeper somehow, and I wake up more refreshed.

Week 3 I tried to reduce dose to 5 mg every other day, just to see if effects would stay. They did stay, but little bit weaker. So I went back to 10 mg daily. It appears that for me this is optimal dose.

I started to search why this works. ISRIB inhibits integrated stress response in brain, which appears on cell level. When brain is under chronic stress, this response blocks protein synthesis that is needed for memory and cognition. ISRIB releases this block. This mechanism explains why it helped me after burnout, I think my brain was stuck in stress response mode. If brain was under chronic stress like mine, or experienced some injury or exhaustion, ISRIB definitely can help to clean that deep mental fog. But if your brain works normally, this probably not what you need.
Overall, I am grateful that I found something that helped to stabilize my cognitive function after burnout.",2,1765710525.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

Ride ($3200 CAD):

\- slightly better build quality

\- flow control kit can be bought separately ($300 CAD, which brings it at basically same price as bianica. Is there any difference in Ride + flow control kit vs Bianca built-in flow control in terms of what you are able to control while pulling a shot?)

\- slightly faster heat up time (10 min vs 25 min, not too sure about the numbers)



Bianica ($3600 CAD):

\- flow control

\- rotary pump (More quiet, and can be pumped in. Though my current apartment does not allow pumping in)



About my set up and usage:

Currently, I use a bambino and df64. I use mostly speciality coffee beans (medium mostly), about 2-3 single shots per day. 2-3 times a week I may have guests come over and I'll make more coffee. About half of them are milk drinks.

I don't really know much about flow control, or different brew temp, but I am interested in learning and trying out new recipes, hence I wanted to upgrade to a new machine with more features to experiment.

I hope I won't have to get a new machine for a long time and don't mind paying more to have all the features (that affects espresso taste) and good build quality. So I ended up with the above 2 machines in my shortlist. Looking for some other opinions, or other machine suggestions for my use case.

1pmb3qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/1pmb3qt/the_loneliness_epidemic_the_loss_of_third_places/,the loneliness epidemic : The loss of third places,"Hello everyone, I don’t know if you guys have discussed third places in architecture here before, but I’m an architecture student graduating this year and my subject focuses on this topic. It’s about how, now more than ever, and especially after Covid and the fast digitalization of our lives, we need a new type of infrastructure: a social one. I’m looking at a lot of research linking the rise of loneliness in recent years to the lack of physical interactions with strangers in real life. And how that’s mostly because we dont have the time or energy for it (f capitalism), but also because the way we design our cities and built spaces is centered on profit and greed rather than on a human scale. So the loss of third places, or at least accessible ones, is completely understandable.

What I’m proposing in my thesis is a neighbourhood third place, a place exclusively dedicated to the social needs of the people. For the place to be viable and also create jobs for local people, some micro-economies could be present, generating revenue that would sustain other spaces in the structure that have no productive goal, in a circular-economy kind of model where the money stays in the hands of the neighborhood. So there could be small coffee shops with relatively low prices, libraries, exhibition spaces, etc.

Then there would be other types of spaces, like modular rooms and areas to plan workshops around art or gardening. A lot of places have done this, where people plant stuff together and then go plant it around the neighborhood (tactical urbanism). Other areas could be used for kids to play, or for other groups to mingle or relax, depending on the program. There will be open spaces with greenery, and everything about this structure will be consciously designed to encourage sociability, creativity, and openness. So light, materials, and shapes should be thought about deeply.

The structure would be under the direct direction of the neighborhood, with spaces inside the third place dedicated to weekly or monthly meetings, where different people come together to talk or express problems they have in their neighborhood, making taking action easier and more realistic. The third place would be recognized as a social public space and financed partly by the government, taxes, and revenues from different businesses inside it.

1pmb2yu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pmb2yu/how_do_i_make_everyone_happy_at_christmas/,How do I make everyone happy at Christmas (including me)?,"Never thought I would be posting here but here we are…

My (F45) partner (M38) and I have been together 5 years. Every year at Christmas, we get together with his family during the day on Christmas Eve or the day after Christmas or both, and we spend an hour or two Christmas Eve night and then all of Christmas Day with my sister and her husband (from one-ish until eight-ish). This has always felt a little out of balance to me, BUT my partner’s family is VERY non-traditional and doesn’t usually do much for holidays/doesn’t really care what day we get together, so it has always seemed fine. My sister is ALL ABOUT Christmas, it is her favorite day, she lives for and plans for it all year, and since our mom passed of cancer in 2019, the two of us is all we really have in the way of family.

So, it has worked out pretty well. Until this year.

My partner’s mom had previously asked us to tell her what we wanted for Christmas this year or give her a list, and we were late getting to that, with my partner reaching out just yesterday to talk to her about it (we have had a lot going on, and again, she usually doesn’t mind this kind of thing). When he talked to her, she said, “Oh, I’m not doing that this year, instead I am taking everyone to the casino! On Christmas Day!” My partner was kind of stunned as this came out of left field, so his response was that he would talk to me about it and get back to her. (I know.)

So, here’s the thing. She knows we always do an all-day thing at my sister’s place. The morning is not an option for me as I have a sleep disorder and am not awake early enough to make that work. And late evening is not an option for his mom as she gets sleepy by 8pm. We could maybe spare an hour or two in the afternoon (between gifts and dinner), but this casino is an hour’s drive away, so it would be two hours of driving plus however long we were there, which I assume would have to be at least…an hour, hour and a half? to not be rude? (I don’t know the etiquette for Christmas at the casino.)

And here’s the thing…I don’t know how \*you\* feel about it? But a casino is literally the \*last\* place on Earth I want to be on Christmas. Like, I can’t think of a worse plan. If you were to design some sort of perfect punishment for me? It would be Christmas at a casino. I don’t want to go to the casino ever. I hate throwing money away, the whole vibe is depressing, and ever since they banned smoking in them, the whole place smells like a butt. And not a cigarette butt. (My partner doesn’t like casinos any more than me, btw.)

So, people/friends/gang? How in the world do I fix this? My partner is meeting up with his mom for coffee in the morning and he will be talking to her about it then. I didn’t know what to have him say so I said I would tell him in the morning. His suggestion was that he ask her if they might want to do it the day AFTER Christmas, but that would be asking to change plans that involve other people as well. 

Adding to the issue is the fact that while his mom is really flexible and not particular, she is VERY sensitive, one of those people who always thinks someone is mad at her if they don’t text back right away. So I am worried about sending a message through my partner. And I am just nervous about saying I can’t or don’t want to go. I love her and don’t want to hurt her feelings or make her feel rejected on Christmas.

What do I do?!?!

TLDR: Partner’s mom send an unexpected invitation for a Christmas activity and I don’t know how to say no. :/",1,1765708509.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I have been low sugar for several months prior to the 100% sugar free diet.

As of day 7, I have noticed A LOT of positive changes, moving from low sugar to no sugar.

About me: I am a 6ft5, 39 year old man. Approx 190 lbs so quite trim, but I do have a ""beer"" belly / abdominal fat (despite never drinking alcohol!), and I tend to store my fat around my chest, neck and face. I am estimated about 17% body fat composition - so in possibly just marginally better than average shape for my age.

During this 7 day 100% sugar free diet, I have also significantly reduced my salt to less than 1.0g a day - this is very low salt in-take. I am eating super clean and tracking everything I consume - recording it a google sheet.

That all said, this is what I have noticed:

\- Massive upgrade in mental clarity. I wouldn't say I was not of clear mind before, but I certainly now understand what people mean by a ""fog"" being removed. This is not subtle.

\- My mood is much more stable. Again, I would not say I was unstable before, I am a calm dude in general. But I am just feeling more easy-going the last few days.

\- My energy levels have improved. I am generally a slow-starter in the morning, but mornings have become a bit easier to handle. This has surprised me given I am in a significant calories deficit at the moment.

\- My eyesight has improved! I do not wear glasses, but my vision is undoubtedly clearer and I focus on objects faster and with less stress. This may sound bizarre but I also feel color pops more now; colors are more vibrant. Difficult to explain.

\- My teeth are MUCH whiter. This has shocked me just how much this has changed and improved within just 7 days, especially as I was starting from a low sugar position.

\- My face has lost a lost of it's puffiness and the bags under my eyes have cleared up. However, I attribute this more toward very low salt than the 100% sugar diet.

\- I feel that my inflammation has improved.

\- No bloating, but did not have much trouble with this anyway.

\- I do not miss sugary snacks at all, and am not thinking about them.

\- I have found moving from low sugar to no sugar very easy. No cravings at all. No problems at all doing a sugar free diet.

\- I find my new diet simplifies my life. I know what I am going to be eating every day. I am not spending time wondering what to cook or what to buy in the shop now. It's simple and that gives me more time back and less decision to make.

\- I am feeling shocked that this has all been achieved in only 7 days.

I eat eggs, vegetables, lean meat, fruit and Greek yoghurt. To drink I have water, 1x black tea, 1x black coffee and 1x green tea a day. It's difficult to say how much of these improvements are just because of zero sugar, as I am also clean eating / almost eliminating salt.",5,1765708249.0,sugarfree,0,1.0,False

I (21f) found Ai porn my (24) bfs of 5 months phone. ( ill call him Robert)

My day
Yesterday (12/13/25) I got off work (3 pm) and met my bf in a neighboring town to do some Christmas shopping, while we were out i had mentioned that i had been feeling kinda insecure about my body (i made a Pinterest board of my dream body - mistake btw dont do that) We then had dinner ( I has had a really bad feeling that he was looking at the waitress when we went to dinner, never caught him, and usually dont have that kind of jealous response) and got stuff to make drinks. We get to my house and we had sex. Then I sat on the floor of my room wrapping presents for my family while he layed in my bed. I wrapped for a few hours (big family and id been Christmas shopping for months so that I could get everyone multiple gifts). When I was done I got up and realized his phone was still on (he told me his password like a week or something ago) I thought nothing of it  and went to plug it in for him he kissed my leg as I reached over him. I was hot with an urge to check his phone, I had never gone though his phone. But i took it into the bathroom and, for the first time, checked his phone. 


My bfs day ( as I understand it)


Woke up at my house in my arms.
Go home as I leave for work ( he has a job he works 4 10s though and has Friday off)


Realize he can make his own porn with AI (he fucking LOVESSS chat gpt btw).



Important bk info before we continue.

He had a coworker (he recently changed jobs) we'll call her Chloe. He had been super upfront about most of his coworkers, including a girl everyone thought had a crush on him. I was chill about it. Then a few months in he randomly asks me if he can add a female coworker on Instagram. I asked if it girl coworker A or B. He said that it was a completely different coworker, Chloe, the lack of having ever brought her up before this caught me of guard obviously. I asked why he had completely neglected to bring her up, and how well they new each other. He showed me her Instagram and she is stunning. 
Turns out, every lunch that he didn't spend with me ( at fucking midnight because he used to work nights) he would spend with her ""talking about marvel"". I was put off by this so he didn't add her back ( I didn't tell him not to add her back brw) He told me that the dont talk outside of work. As he was leaving his old job he asked if I would feel comfortable with him hanging out with her outside of work, I said he could do what he wanted, but id probably feel more comfortable if I met her first. Then on his last day, his ""coworkers 
"" got him a little minion plush.



What I found

Time stamped from 10 am to 1pm on 12/13/25
I opened his gallery first. It was FULL of porn screenshots and screen recordings. With normal pictures sprinkled throughout. Some of these were made with Ai. His gallery also included screenshots of her Instagram and a 30 second screen recording of him slipping though her pictures. One of those pictures had a poorly added dick pointing at her mouth. Then there was i picture that I HAD TAKEN OF US, where he cropped me out and used Ai to make it look like he was holding the phone. And he used that altered image to put himself in a sequel situation with an Instagram model. 

Time stamped 10pm same day (while I was wrapping presents 2 feet away)

So many screenshots of women with my ""dream body"" in various thirty trapesque poses. At least 20 different images. 



Messages

He had been secretly texting her, her contact was under her last name, where everyone else was first name. She had been the one to buy him that minion, which had been buckled up in his back seat since. She confessed her feelings for him, KNOWING AND MENTIONING ME. She was saying, that she didn't mean to over step, but they had an instant connection and the way he looked at her made her feel special. He turned her down, then added that I, his gf, was ""iffy"" on them hanging out but I was down to meet her. She then mentioned again that he said things that made her feel like she was special to him. He continued to text her, more infrequently though. There last message was one that he had sent her about his new job. 4 days before it went down.


Odds and ends

So many porn apps
Emails saying his account at only fans was successfully made- yayyy.


What i was thinking 

I felt immediately detached and numb. I was shaking so violently you would've thought I was seizing. It literally didn't- actually doesn't- feel real. When I tell you, this man was soooo good to me. Opened all the doors, so patient and understanding, made me laugh so much. I never carry anything when hes there, he even proudly carries my purse if it slips from shoulder once. Always put me first (so I thought obvi) He was kinda jealous, not in a way that a challenged my autonomy (except an ongoing argument about me going out to bars or clubs with friends, had not happened yet in our relationship, but my cousin was about to turn 21)( he did also once show concern about me reading smut books, i shut that shit down real quick) He complemented me all the time, so loving and openly affectionate.
Also Robert is gorgeous, a little bit of a lean dad bod vibe, and a KILLER face card. And he knows how to dress, and always smells super good. Genuinely everything has felt so mentioned to be with him, I remember telling my mom that I felt like he was either the one, or he was gonna absolutely break me.

My last and first relationship was from 17 to 20 (like 2.8 years), this was with another woman. then I was single for just over a year only lightly fooling around with 1 other man. He was my first adult relationship and first man that I was with sexualy (didn't go all the way with the other guy). 
Also note I'm hugely physically affectionate, definitely a big love language of mine, I am constantly touching him, even if we are fighting I NEED the physical reassurance. 



My night continued


I went back to my room finding him lying awake. I climbed over him plugged in my phone and said. ""Oops I just unplugged your phone with my elbow"" - FYI my acting was good fr.
 He was like ""oh, I was looking for it all over"" 
"" you didn't even pick up the pillows?"" 
"" i totally did""
"" you must have been really tired"" - ik gaslighting is wrong but I was not ready to talk about it. 
""I was... do you promise it was right there?"" 
""I picked it up from right there, where else would it have been?""
""I kinda feel like you looked though it in the bathroom you gone for a while""
"" yea, why would I have done that, would I have found anything"" - his breathing picked up"" you look nervous, shod I check it right now""
""Do you promise my phone was here the whole time""
"" i do not, if i brought it to the bathroom and looked though it what would it have found""
"" nothing""
"" are you sure, not in your gallery or anything""
""Porn""
""Is that all I found?""

Basically I chewed his ass to hell and back, cuz you got me fucked up. I also drank during this convo, (not my proudest moment) I didn't make him leave but told him not to touch me. I actually just laid down and turned away duringone of the silences between me snappingat him and him trying to explain. ( ik very weak, but I really didn't know how i felt- still dont. Im so numb.) I woke up and we kinda continued the conversation ( I low-key started hyperventilating) he asked if I wanted a hug. I told him I couldn't decide if I wanted him to hold me and tell me everything was gonna be okay, or never touch me again. I got up and showered and changed in the bathroom. 

Dont be mad, remember I was in shock okay, I told him I was going to get coffee and breakfast( 2 pm) and asked if he wanted to come with me. He said yes, i cleaned my room and we left, we both took my car, because I needed to feel in control I think, we drove in silence mostly, my dj (spotify) was eating this man alive, I didn't make eye contact with him once. Then we sat in my car for an hour barley saying a word. He says hes not attracted to her, and that he has a porn addiction, at this point I forgot the lying about the messages. I decided I was gonna go to the mall and drag him behind me. We spent like 2 hours there. I barely spoke to him and carried ALL my own shit, and opened my own doors despite him offering several times. Every time we passed an attractive woman I felt like I was going to die. I didn't trust him anymore I felt so ugly and undesirable.


We get back to my house and its dark out. He tells me there's a meteor shower tonight. We talk more, he says he'd understand if I left him. I asked him what he'd tell people, his sister is a friend of mine and the one who introduced us. He told me he didn't know. I told him I consider the pictures of Chloe, the altered one and every screenshot and the screen recording, to be cheating. I asked how he saw it, he said he didn't think it was cheating because they hadn't had an enotionally or sexually intimate interaction. This reminded me that she confessed her feelings to him AND he kept contact. Then that reminded me that he told me they weren't in contact at all. I told him either way - cheater. Then I remembered that those pictures were saved before and RIGHT FUCKING AFTER, we had sex. I told him thats fucked, and it makes me feel unattractive, unwanted, and basically like those feelings I had had about not being enough (at this point I told him about the Pinterest board) felt justified or proven to be true, because I look nothing like those women. He told me he didn't want me to look like them and I laughed. Then i cried for the first time about it while telling him how disgusting and unlovable, and unwanted he had made me feel. He started crying and apologizing too. I told him that I didn't think EVEN if we stayed together that I would eer let him tough me sexualy again, and thats if I let him touch me period. He told me he would do anything to make it better and that he was completely okay with that, if thats what I needed. I told him I couldn't do that to myself and he begged for another chance acknowledging the fact that he didn't deserve one. He begged for me to take more time to consider it. I just cried. He asked for a goodbye hug and I nearly collapsed in his arms. Then we sat facing each other after we had stopped crying. 

And I saw a shooting star
He sat next to me and we stargazed. Then we laid down next to eachother on the freezing concrete, before he grabbed blankets to lay on and get warm with from his car. I told him stories about Greek mythology and we laid for hours. When the cold got to much we got back in my car and hardly spoke again, I told him again that no one had ever hurt me like that. He told me he was scared to leave, because he felt like it might be the last time he ever saw me. Then I fell asleep. I woke up at midnight and he told me to go inside. I did, I told him to text me when he got home.



 Its now 3:30 am. I feel like I've dreamed everything. I know I have to leave for myself and my mental well-being, but I don't understand how the man who made me feel so loved and wanted could also make me feel like this.
