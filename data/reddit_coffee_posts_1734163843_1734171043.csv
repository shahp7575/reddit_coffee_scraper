Hey everyone!

I just moved to Lancaster, UK, for an exciting new job, and I’m on the lookout for friendly faces and fun activities! 🏙️✨ 

As a newcomer, I’m finding it a bit challenging to connect with people and discover all that this charming town has to offer. I love exploring new places, trying out local cafes, restaurants, and participating in community events, but I could really use some guidance. 

If you're local or just looking to meet someone new, I’d love to grab a coffee, explore the city together, or even check out any hidden gems you recommend! Whether it’s a stroll around the park, a visit to a museum, or just hanging out, I’m eager to make new friends and create some great memories. 

Let’s discover Lancaster together! Drop a comment or message me if you’re interested. Looking forward to hearing from you! 😊

1hdzpmi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hdzpmi,What could be doing this to the stem of my adasonii/monkey mask?,"I bought this plant last year from the supermarket so it was essentially one of my first ever plants and that was back when I had no idea what I'm doing. I've learnt a fair bit now and have honestly just been lazy and didn't get around to doing this one right. 

Things I've done wrong:
1. Over potted it. Massive 50x50 concrete, general premium potting mix instead of aroid mix. I think I divided it or it came with two plants which I put diagonally in the pot towards the outer section. It's outdoors 
2. Water it carelessly and whenever, no schedule
3. It gets direct morning sun for a few hours and then bright-dim indirect light throughout the afternoon depending on the angle the sun is hitting it
4. Never pruned it
5. Didn't train it to climb, although the stem is holding itself off the ground like a dieffenbachia/dumb cane

Compared to some people's indoor adasonii, it appears to have larger leaves and it's not leggy, it's quite bushy with thicker stems.

In terms of pests, I haven't seen any on mine, I do have green caterpillars eating some of my flowers, and I have seen ants around from time to time in other parts of the garden. There's spiders around the pots.

I live in Sydney Australia and it's early summer for us now.

I could guess the leaves are getting sunburnt and that's why they're yellow and crispy on a few sections. Along the way I gave it composted coffee grounds, seaweed solution, green plant NPK formula along the way. 

What's doing the grooving on the stem segment? It was like that on the other plant as well, at a few places. I've given them a prune today but it'll happen again if I don't do something, presumably

1hdzkoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hdzkoz/just_a_bad_day_not_so_short_rant/,Just a bad day (not so short rant),"Today just sucks.
People think they can just be rude and arrogant to retail/hospitality workers like it's their right.
I work in a small, but busy cafe, which closes at 4pm, every day.
Within the last 10 minutes of us being opened, about 30 people come and order.
Meanwhile, at this stage we are take-away only, as our dining area has already been packed away and cleaned.
These people think they are entitled to come and unpack our dining room and sit, despite being told we are closing soon and they cannot sit down.
3:55pm, about half our dining room is full, and we still have a line of people waiting to order, and another 5 people waiting to collect.
At this point, our lights are off, closed sign is up and everything else is already packed away (you would think this would give the impression we are about to close for the night, right? Think again)
Despite all this, people continue to join the queue.
Finally we hit 4:00pm and can stop taking orders. We are left with a huge mess to clean, with only 30min to do so (there's only 2 people working at any time). So it's a mad rush to get everything done on time because corporate doesn't like to pay overtime (typical, right?)

While we are in the middle of cleaning, everything is switched off, we get people coming and asking if we are still open, does the closed sign and no lights on not indicate the answer for you?

Also, we still have someone refusing to leave the dining area, so my co-worker politely tells her we are closed now and need to pack the chairs away, to which the customer replies"" well, I'm finished my coffee now so I guess thats okay"" and slowly gathers her belongings and walks out.
Like hello??? Even if you weren't finished you would still have to leave, because you know, we are closed? It wasn't a suggestion to leave.

Then, to top off this chaotic day, someone hit my car in the parking lot, and didn't even leave a note!
It is only minor cosmetic damage but have some decency!!

1hdzjek,https://www.reddit.com/r/reversecirclejerk/comments/1hdzjek/headpat_review_bkornblume/,Headpat Review - Bkornblume,"Dim Lamplight
Pen flicks on paper. Paper is put into a pile. Rinse and repeat. Pen flicks on paper. Paper is put into a pile. Rinse and repeat. My hand started to ache and I rubbed it for a while before continuing my paperwork. After taking a glance out of the window to my left, I would note the night, which was… Oddly dim. The moon hid behind the cover of clouds, hiding like a needle in a haystack. I felt lonely, bored and tired. And, in one mocking move from the universe, it began to rain. A light drizzle at first, then it would come faster and stronger until I had to shut my window to keep my table from getting wet.

A sigh. A long, drawn-out sigh. It was taking me to the peak of my self-control to prevent myself from just falling asleep right there, right now. The room was cold, but not too unpleasant - it was perfectly tuned for sleeping. I would provide myself some entertainment momentarily by flipping my pen and catching it. Then, another sigh. I was getting tired. I wanted to sleep, and I wanted it bad. Sleep, or at least a conversation with someone with some bit of humor to wake me up, something to wake me up. Feeling thirsty and tired, I decided to get up and haul ass over to the kitchen, where I brewed some coffee and sat in the even dimmer lamplight of the kitchen while waiting for my coffee. 

I contemplated the life choices that brought me to this walk of life and looked at some old family photos I have stuffed in my wallet, contemplating even further on the talent I used to have but wasted on this damn desk job. I’m starting to doubt that food on the table is worth writing a truckload of repetitive old paperwork for, and if starvation is worth it just for a much more active job instead of this draining desk job.

After a bit of contemplation, I remembered my roommate. She was supposed to be back with dinner by now, because neither of us could cook. As if in cue, the door in the living room creaked open.

“Hey. I got dinner.” Her voice came from the living room, tired, just like me.

“Great, about time.” I looked over at her. 

“Roomie?” I asked softly.

“Hm?” She responded.

“What did you say your name was again?” I asked out of curiosity. She was always gone early, and returned late, so I didn’t have much of a chance to talk to her.

“Ah- I-I just go by Bkornblume.” Her soft reply came from the living room.

“Okay.” I sighed- At least I had some sort of a friend. In Bkornblume or whatever her name was. Dinner was a quiet affair, with little to no talking, and me getting up to wash up a bit and go to bed came by in a blur - and the next thing I know, I was in bed. 

Silent Night
What also came by as a blur was Bkornblume. Somehow she’d entered my room despite me locking the door, like what is up with this girl? She climbed onto the bed beside me and looked up at me tiredly, and I took this moment to check her out (DON’T BLAME ME, SHE WAS FINE AS HELL). She looked up at me with those shiny blue eyes, like little gems in water, and as I pulled her scarf down from her head, I noticed her silky-looking silver hair as it shined in my lamplight.

“You look… Tired.” I whispered softly, leaning into her ear.

“M-hm, thanks, Captain Obvious.” She replied in that ever so small voice of hers.

“Shut it already and go to sleep.” I said in a not-so-threatening or intimidating voice.

“What are you gonna do about it?” Another smug reply from the otherwise unassuming sleepy girl right beside me.

Then - silence. Blessed, tranquil silence fell on us like a warm, fuzzy blanket on a winter night. I looked down at Bkornblume and she looked up at me, but she had a needy expression on her face.

“What’s the matter..?” I asked, looking at her with a bit of concern - was she hungry? Thirsty? Or even sick?

“I-I need to tell you something.” She said with a blush on her face.

“What’s something?” 

“I-I need…” She blushed even hotter. Never would I ever have seen her blush this much any other time, so what did she want of me?

“Speak up.” I said softly, not in a condemning tone, but in a more calming tone. She caved in and buried her head into the pillow beside me.

“I-I need headpats… I-I know it sounds ridiculous, but-” She stammered out, too shy to tell me of her headpat-based fantasies.

“Sure.”

Bkornblume perked up, her blue eyes getting some light.

“Really..?”

“Yes, really.” I said, smiling.

She curled up a bit and sat right next to me, and I ran my hand through her hair. The moment my hand touched her strands, I froze. They were… Warm. Not unpleasantly warm, but warm enough to feel homely. I kept rubbing, and rubbing until my hand gave out. She looked at me with an expectant look, seemingly wanting more rubs, or the main event - headpats. So I obliged, and began to genuinely pat her head with a smile on my face. Her hair provided a suitable cushion for my hand to cup and rub every time I pat her head, and soon, I had coaxed her to sleep. I stopped patting her head and sighed happily - now I’m sure I’ll never be alone as long as she’s in the house.

Headpat Review
In terms of her looks, Bkornblume is just the right blend of pretty and adorable. Her face always smiles, be it genuine or smugly as a joke, and in my opinion that just makes her even more endearing. She stands at just about the average height of a late teenage girl, but without the freckles, acne or social anxiety that comes with being a teenage girl. Her pretty silver hair and her even prettier blue eyes make her an alluring sight that, if you aren’t careful, might end up having you stuck staring at her. 

In terms of headpat capability, her hair is fluffy and long enough to sufficiently give a soft patting area, but not long enough that you cannot feel her body warmth itself. As earlier mentioned, her eyes and hair just make her an adorably alluring sight to stare at and get lost whole doing so. Plus, she knows how to appreciate her headpat sessions afterwards.

1hdzicv,https://www.reddit.com/r/InkWielder/comments/1hdzicv/its_finally_here_its_somewhere_beneath_us/,It's Finally here... (It's Somewhere Beneath Us physical copies),"After so many years of tinkering away on the story, it all finally comes to a head today.

It's Somewhere Beneath Us is published in physical form, and available to purchase.

It honestly feels very surreal to know that my work is now out on an actual marketplace for anyone to pick up and see. When first I uploaded my stories on the ""writing"" corners of the internet, there was sort of this strange comfort in knowing that only certain kindred spirits would read it. Now my neighbor could just go buy a copy of my work and have it out on their coffee table. It's just odd. I never thought I would get to this point...

There really isn't much else I can say other than thank you. Thank you so, SO much. I know a simple book through KDP isn't a very big deal compared to some authors who have their works in book stores across the globe, but it means a great deal to me to be able to hold my work in my hands, bound and printed in a form that I'd always dreamed about. None of that would have happened without all of your positivity and encouragement over the years; I don't think I would have had the motivation to pursue it. Again, thank you.

If you've enjoyed 'Somewhere Beneath Us' or any of my other work and would like to support me, please consider buying a copy; It would mean the world to me, and it would help push me a little closer toward that goal of maybe getting to do this as a career someday.

You can find it [**right here**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQGGCT5M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ZAF803BTZ075&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2uWxwd77qbGnRPYCWLGprse-omQraJrVsVXY2OAnE2h_MOTJHcetrGWDQmnbOgvXsQ0UFUz35Tl5M8uWJCDU1vqW_nJ3SG99vgYueNEUz1I.bUtFCP7JXMEwD7tzUlKSJjwXvtLUgRkciNlCFSC5FG0&dib_tag=se&keywords=It%27s+somewhere+beneath+us&qid=1734164887&s=books&sprefix=it%27s+somewhere+beneath+us%2Cstripbooks%2C196&sr=1-1)  **<< (Physical Book Link)**

(Sorry to make you read so far for the link, but damn it, you're going to sit there and let me gush about how thankful I am for you whether you like it or not)

If you do buy a copy and have the time, please also consider leaving a review! I don't know a whole lot about the kindle algorithm, but apparently they help a lot, and it would be awesome to have more people discover my writing.

If you somehow are seeing this and didn't originally follow me because of ISBU, you can read the whole story for free right [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ink_Wielder/comments/1ajypwi/somewhere_beneath_us_part_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). The content is the same, albeit, less refined and lacking in the flair that I added for the physical version.

If you aren't interested in buying a physical copy or can't afford it right now, I completely understand. Still, I think it's your right to be able to read the last words of the novel under the special thanks section, so I'll leave you with them here:

*And to all my friends and family, as well as the hundreds of lovely, magnificent people across the internet who have followed and supported my writing over the years. I wouldn’t have found my passion or be where I am today without your endless encouragement, comments, and feedback, and this book simply would not exist.* 

*Thank you a million times over.*

Woah!” Her voice pulled the attention of another pair of feet as they dropped off her bed. The girls danced to a radio as it played the most popular song of that month. Amber did not dare to try and sing along knowing she could not keep up. But Sam knew all the words and made sure you knew it. Their feet tapped at different speeds to the rhythm of the song. Sam’s feet were hyper and vibrant while Amber's were still and slow. “Why do I put myself in these situations!” Sam's cute charming voice bounced off the walls as Amber tried to join in. 

“Y-Your-Your w-w-worth.” Amber sadly couldn't keep up with the lyrics as they passed by. Her small squeaky voice tried its best but kept stalling. 

“No no no, dance like this.” Sam instructed the best she could as she tried to get Amber's feet to move like her's. Eyes caught sight of them. A crack began in the door. Fingers pushed it open as the girls took up all the space between their beds. Once the song stopped Sam turned to the door. Disgusted, she quickly slammed the door. “Stop watching us pervert!” A chuckle came from the one standing on the other side. 

She thought the girls were so adorable, and how could she not with them being so cute together. She dragged herself downstairs as she counted heads. A tuft of blonde hair sat on the couch watching TV with a main of black silk hanging over the dining room table. This vibrant creature hanging over a coffee cup was Amber. Her long dark hair trailed around her glasses. Her thin small lips sipped coffee as her fingers wrapped around the cup. Her messy dress was a pattern of random rags. Amber pulled her hair back as her bangs floated over her glasses.

“How are the girls?” Amber asked her question as she let coffee drip out of her mouth. The question pulled a smile.

“Dancing together in the middle of the floor,” Sofia said, as she took her seat at the table. This tall drink of energy was Sofia, her long red duel braids ran down her body over her tank top and slacks. Small freckles hid on her face only to be caught if you look hard enough. The tuft of blonde hair finally left the couch as he made his way to the bathroom. A subtle burp dragged him through the kitchen. His dark brown beard hid his thick lips. Then suddenly the front door opened. Feet dragged themselves inside. The first to get into the kitchen was Brian. His shoulder length black hair fell behind his ears as his rough voice called out to another. 

“No, don't get up, we got this.” The girls went wide eyed watching him. Brian circled the table as he set down bags. His lips found Amber's as he started putting away stuff. Sofia dragged herself to her feet as identical pairs of feet walked in. Not only was it their feet but just about everything else was identical too except for their hair. Diana also known as Doge had long brown hair pulled into a ponytail tail that almost dragged on the floor, while Kaylin also known as Kitty had short shoulder length brown hair that frizzed out on the ends. 

Kitty had her sights set on the kitchen as she desperately wanted to put her things down. Doge had her eyes set on something else. Sofia took bags from her hands as they shared a kiss. Doge unrolled her flannel sleeves as the cold followed her. Everyone circled the kitchen table as the tuft of blonde hair returned. This was Lucas, Kitty's boyfriend. Just about every member of the family was here except one, and he soon arrived through the front door dancing on his feet.

“Don't stop believing.” His words sang him across the room as all eyes locked onto him. This was Liam the son of Sofia and Brian. He was born through a passion of wanting to make a family and the help of doctors. He slung his backpack over his chest as everyone greeted him. And just like that he rushed upstairs. His ears perked as he pulled his wavy red hair behind his ears. His hands pushed open the door calling to him. He watched as his sisters jumped on their feet to the music. 

Amber shifted as she saw the door move. Sam just collapsed on her bed letting the energy fade from her. Amber turned off the music as she heard loud footsteps coming her way.

“It's lateies ladies, that means bedtime.” Amber's cute voice became monstrous as she wished the girls goodnight. Sam just rolled over pulling her blanket over herself. Amber sat on her bed dragging her feet up with her.

“T-T-T-uck m-m-me in?” Amber's question pulled her mother to her side. Amber pulled the blanket tight as she kissed her daughter on the forehead. As she whipped around Doge and Sofia stood in the doorway. They quietly fought over who would kiss Sam goodnight. Doge, winning the game of rock paper scissors, entered the room to a vile snarl. 

“Don't even think about touching me.” Sam's voice sent chills through Doge. As Doge got closer the girl hissed. Doge’s hesitation was quickly taken away as Sofia raced in pinning her daughter to the bed. The girls kissed their daughter goodnight as she fought them. Once they left the room Sam threw her pillow at the door. Sam’s voice echoed a small scream as she got her anger out. Her temper relaxed as she pulled her blanket over her head.

“Goo-dni-night sissy.” Amber’s quiet voice pulled a goodnight from her sister as their eyes grew heavy and tired. 

“Goodnight Am.” And just like that they fell asleep. 

The morning came quickly with the sun. The girls woke to the voices of adults filling the kitchen. Sam was eager to see her friends at school while Amber was a bit more reserved. Sam raced down the stairs darting for the cereal cabinet. Amber just sat at the kitchen table watching her sister eat as her mother entered the room. 

“See all gone.” Amber's words pulled her tongue out as Brian inspected her mouth. Sam's eyes watched Amber as she set a bottle of pills on the table. Before she could make out the label the bottle went right into her pocket. Amber toasted a couple bagel before smashing an egg between them. After she cut the sandwich in half she left it in front of her daughter. The Ambers split the sandwich as Sofia entered the room holding her briefcase. 

“Sam, finish your cereal. I don't want to be late.” Sofia's words brought Sam's tongue out of her mouth as she pointed it at her mother. Brian moved behind his daughter as he finished the last bite of her sandwich. Brian pushed Amber out the door as Sam raced to the car. The girls sat in the back of the minivan as their parents took the front seats. 

“Be good today, both of you,” Amber said, kissing Brian goodbye before tapping the window next to her daughter. The car pulled on to the rural street as music streamed through the car. Brian watched his daughter in the side mirror as she read her book. Anytime Sofia looked into her rearview mirror she could see her daughter singing to herself. 

“Oh my God, Mom can we stop for coffee.” Sofia quickly told her daughter no. The car quickly turned into an argument. “Come on come on come, that's not fair.” Sofia was sick of these arguments.

“You are too young for coffee, stop shouting and bothering your sister.” Sofia's words didn't help one bit. 

“I'm o-ok.” Amber's compliance only raised Sam's voice.

“See it's not bothering her, and why do you get coffee if I can't have coffee that doesn't even make sense.” Sofia almost couldn't bear her daughter's words. She just stomped on the break as they got to the school. Sofia took a deep breath as she was about to turn into the parking lot. But before she could Sam opened her door. “Please wait until I'm in the school before you get out,” Sam said, rushing out of the car. Sofia took a long calming breath before looking into the back at Amber. Sofia was waiting for something that did not happen.

“D-ad w-w-will you walk m-m-me to c-c-class?” Sofia pulled into the parking lot as Brian told his daughter he'd be happy to walk her to class. The pair split up as Brian held Amber's hand guiding her through the halls. The snickers of boys and girls filled the hall as they made it to class. 

“Remember I'm just down the hall if you need anything.” Brian reassured his daughter everything was ok before leaving her at the door. As he stepped down the hall a voice called out to him. Brian followed it into the principal’s office. “Principal Louis?” Louis tapped his fingers on his desk as he waited for Brian to take a seat. Brian watched the light bounce off his shiny head.

“Don't worry you're not in trouble, it's about that daughter of your's.” Brian sighed as he sunk in his chair. Brian let the echoes of children fill his ears as he leaned back in his chair. “I just think there's a classroom where she could get more attention.” Brian's chair fell flat as he leaned over the desk.

“She's fine.” Louis didn't like his tone and immediately stood facing away from him. 

“She can't speak more than a sentence out loud.” Brian stood up making his height.

“She reads at a sixth grade level and writes at an eighth grade level, she's fine.” Brian stormed out of the room as his eyes met Sofia's. They both looked at each other worried before crossing each other.

“Ah and then I have you, I'm sorry to bring you in like this.” Louis turned to face her as she sat in the chair, legs crossed. Sofia just remained quiet. “I can't have anymore outbursts ok, just figured something out please.” Sofia just nodded to the worry in his voice before leaving his presence. Sofia circled the halls as her sights set on Sam walking backwards to class with her friends. Sofia grabbed her by the arm as she dragged her around a corner.

“Help a teacher is kidnapping me!” Sofia covered her mouth quickly as she snapped her finger in her face.

“I am this close to exploding, I get called into the principal's office more than you do, so please for the love of God settle down and stop being such a nuisance for your teacher, I love you bye.” After her angry whisper was over she vanished to her classroom. Sofia was in the middle of long term subbing between her regular duties at the school. 

It felt like a chore. Day in and day out. Tests, vocabulary, homework, group activities; these things filled up their days. Sam and Amber had just a hall between them. They were in the same grade but different classrooms. 

The job of a teacher was never an easy one. The low pay, the rowdy kids, the neglectful or angry parents. That was just the tip of the iceberg for teachers like Brian and Sofia. But let's not forget the other teachers. There was Mr. Lucious Rocke of kindergarten, Mr. Todd Henderson he taught second and third grade combined, Ms. Sally Fiel the gym teacher, we can't forget Mrs. Lila Sugar of the fourth grade, or Mr. Dave Luca who also teaches fourth grade. There's too many to count in this school with grading going from kindergarten to eighth. I haven't even mentioned the lunch ladies, or the people in the office, or the security guards and yard duties. You could really see how packed this place was and how easy it would be to overlook something. 

Amber sat in the back of Mr. Luca's room. She was tucked away in the corner. She didn't like being in the front with people watching her. She seemed the obvious choice to have up front for extra attention, but she made it clear to the teacher that she didn't want that. 

Sam's desk was right up in the front row. In fact it was right next to the teacher's. Mrs. Sugar had no patience with Sam and often dragged her desk closer to hers. Sitting still was never Sam's strong suit. 

The day felt long and arduous. Sam couldn't help but laugh at words she found funny in her text book as her friends joined in. While one hall over Amber was deep in her book. The class was meant to slowly read with each while one of them read out loud. Amber was a couple pages ahead of everyone but with her finger still on the page everyone else was. And just like that she was called on. Amber stood holding up her book.

“Th-e-re w-w-was a.” Amber tried her best to just finish a sentence but it became harder as voices startled her. Amongst the little snickers was one voice in particular. 

“Pft kid can't even read.” This voice immediately got a glare from the teacher. Amber tried to keep her momentum going.

“Sun th-th-that c-c-came.” Amber clenched the book tight as her words stuttered out.

“T-t-t-today Junior!” Mr. Luca quickly turned to Kimberly as he pointed to the door. Her outburst was most upsetting. Amber just sat down with her face in her book. The teacher made sure he personally let Amber know everything was ok. Not that it helped. Amber just wanted to be left alone. She was not called on again. Finally it was the time of the day kids waited for lunch. 

As Amber left the classroom eyes were on her. Standing a couple inches taller than her was Kimberly also known as Kim. Her bright red hair rolled down over her dress. She had the eyes of a cat and the movements of one too. She snuck up behind Amber tapping her on the shoulder. Amber knew she was there and didn't want a confrontation. Kim just walked behind her, rapidly tapping her shoulders. Amber quickly turned down a random hall taking the long way to the cafeteria. Amber passed right by Sam who was walking with her friends. Sam's eyes caught Kim laughing as she watched Amber walk away fast.

The line was around the building if you wanted pizza. Flat packaged tacos had the smallest line right next to the sandwiches. Sam, waiting, going the distance for pizza. Her table sat near the door so her and her friends could comment on the people in line. 

Sitting on the floor Amber slid a greasy taco onto her banana boat. Eyes were on her but not the ones she expected. Brian was watching her from behind a window on a door. Sofia caught his stocker behavior red handed. 

“Look at her, she's sitting all alone, I'm gonna go sit with her.” Sofia had to stop him from doing something he'd regret. “But she's all alone, where is your daughter? Why isn't she sitting with her?” Sofia couldn't make Brian happy no matter what she said.

“I can't make her do anything, and you can't invade too much in her life.” Sofia tried her best but all she could really do was peel him away from the door. As if God was sleeping, the events of the day spiraled completely out of control. As Amber nibbled on her taco a pepperoni hit her in the face. Amber slowly pulled her head up as laughter erupted. Kim was almost hanging off her seat dying of laughter. She quickly jumped to her feet running over to Amber.

“Oops sorry, I was aiming for the wall, guess I couldn't tell the difference.” Kim’s words were like daggers that Amber didn't know how to defend against. She couldn't say anything for it would be immediately ridiculed. Amber just stood only for Kim to block her path. The laughter filled her head, dragging her back to the floor. Amber just covered her ears trying to imagine she was someplace else. “What's wrong d-d-don’t you have something to say?” Amber had nothing to say. In fact Amber wasn't even there. She was on a beach helping to solve a cold case with her pet detective Arty the Aardvark. Just as Amber was about to leave reality something pulled her back. 

“I've got something to say.” Sam's voice pulled Amber's attention as Kim turned around. Sam grabbed Kim's shoulder as she reeled back her fist. “Eat fist.” And just like that it was lights out for Kim. Sam punched her square across the face. Once Kim was down Amber slowly crawled up the wall. 

The bell pulled teachers into their rooms and behind their desks. Brian wrote the next stage of his lesson plan on the board as kids piled in when the principal caught his attention. Brian was dragged out to his office. Brian had no idea what was going on until he saw Sofia standing there waiting for them. Their girls were sitting in front of the principal's desk. 

“Ok I'm not here to mince words, Samantha punched a student in the mouth.” The principal's words sparked outrage from Sam and her mother. Brian was wondering why Amber was here.

“It's because this stupid girl was picking on my sissy. What was I supposed to do, not hit her!” Sam couldn't keep her inside voice. Brian took a knee as he asked Amber if it was true. Amber just nodded. 

“So is she permanently injured? Is she getting in trouble? Why is my child getting in trouble for standing up for her sister?” Louis pinched his eyes trying to think of what to say. 

“Ok stop just stop, detention for Samantha and Kimberly for one week, this school has a no violence policy, Sam is suspended for the rest of the day.” Louis quickly pushed them out with his words. They stood in the hall for a second before splitting up. Brian just ran his hands through Amber's hair.

“You can always talk to me about anything you know that.” Brian wanted his point to be clear as he hugged her. Sofia dragged Sam out to the front of the school. 

“Violence is never the answer, you should never hurt another person.” Sofia’s words brought a bubble of emotions to the surface in her daughter until she hugged her. “You did the right thing, always protect your sister.” Their hug felt like it lasted forever until the bell rang again. “I called your mother, she will be here any minute.” Sofia waited until a pickup truck came into view. Sofia had some teaching left so she left Sam in the hands of her other mother. Sam just hopped into the passenger seat. 

“So you punched a student?” Sam ignored Doge as she leaned on her window. “Heard you really laid her out for mocking Amber.” 

“She deserved it running her mouth like she did.” Doge couldn't hide her smile flexing at her words. 

“Who taught you how to punch like that?” Sam perked up in her chair.

“Aunt Amber showed me a couple moves.” Sam demonstrated these moves in her confined seat. “This is the one two.” Doge just watched her punch the air. And then something surprising happened. “Hey Mom, can we get coffee?” Doge tried to hide her vibrant smile as she turned on a red. 

“Ok ok let's get coffee, don't tell your mother.” The pair pulled into a drive thru as Sam pulled out her phone for rewards points. ",1,1734168481.0,stories,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular cosmetic dental procedure, capturing the attention of many seeking to enhance their smiles. As individuals consider teeth whitening before and after, the changes they experience can be remarkable and even life-altering. Knowing how this treatment can impact one's appearance and confidence can inform your decision on whether to pursue it.

Many people yearn for a bright, white smile. Stains from coffee, tea, red wine, or even aging can dull the natural shine of your teeth. Before undergoing teeth whitening, it's common to feel apprehensive. You might wonder if the results will live up to your expectations. However, witnessing the before and after transformations can be incredibly motivating.

One of the key aspects of teeth whitening is understanding the different methods available. Here are some popular options:

- **Professional In-Office Whitening:** This method is conducted by a dentist. It gives quick results, often whitening up to several shades in a single visit.
- **At-Home Kits:** Many people opt for at-home whitening kits provided by dentists. These are usually more affordable and flexible, allowing you to whiten your teeth at your convenience.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** Whitening toothpaste, strips, and gels are easier to find in local stores. They are less potent than professional methods but can still show noticeable results.
- **Natural Remedies:** While not as effective, some people explore natural options like baking soda or coconut oil. These can help maintain brightness but take longer to see results.

Transitioning from before to after teeth whitening can bring about significant emotional and psychological changes. Many individuals report feeling more confident and socially open after achieving their desired level of whiteness. The visual difference is not just in the color of the teeth but also in the overall appearance of the face. A bright smile can enhance facial features, making you seem more approachable and friendly.

The emotional benefits of teeth whitening can allow you to experience your life differently. Some transformations include:

- **Boosted Self-Esteem:** Shiny, white teeth can dramatically improve your self-image, making you more willing to smile and engage in social situations.
- **Increased Opportunities:** An attractive smile can positively influence personal and professional interactions, opening doors for networking and promising relationships.
- **Improved Oral Hygiene Habits:** Many individuals who undergo whitening become more proactive about maintaining their oral health. They may invest more in dental care and commit to regular checkups.

However, it’s essential to understand that teeth whitening isn't a permanent solution. The results can vary based on the individual's diet, oral hygiene practices, and lifestyle. Many find the need to touch up their results every several months to keep their smiles bright. Choosing to maintain your whiteness may involve avoiding foods that cause staining and opting for dentist-approved maintenance products.

Another consideration is the occasional side effects associated with teeth whitening. Some people may experience tooth sensitivity or gum irritation. It's crucial to consult with a dental professional before starting any whitening treatment, ensuring a plan that works best for you. They can provide insights on your unique dental health and recommend methods that minimize potential discomfort.

Celebrating the differences and focusing on personal progress can bring satisfaction and joy.

The impact of teeth whitening before and after can be profound. From newfound confidence to improved social interactions, the transformations provide many benefits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure, with many options available for achieving a brighter smile. When looking into teeth whitening methods, understanding what changes to expect before and after the treatment can help you make an informed decision. Let's explore various approaches and their effects.

### Common Teeth Whitening Methods

There are several teeth whitening methods available, each with its own unique process and results. Here are a few of the most common methods:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This professional treatment is performed by dentists using high-concentration bleaching agents. You can see noticeable results instantly, often lightening teeth by several shades in just one session.
- **At-Home Kits:** These can be provided by a dentist or purchased over the counter. They include whitening gels and custom trays or strips. Results vary and may take several days to notice a significant difference.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These pastes contain mild abrasives and chemical agents that help to remove surface stains. However, they typically only offer subtle changes over time.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people use baking soda or activated charcoal in hopes of whitening their teeth. While these methods are popular, they often don't provide dramatic results.
- **Laser Whitening:** This is a more advanced professional option, where lasers activate whitening agents applied to the teeth. Many find this method provides fairly immediate results.

### What to Expect Before Treatment

Before starting any teeth whitening regimen, you should consult your dentist. They will evaluate your dental history and current condition. Here are some important points to consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Assessing Your Needs:** Your dentist may take photographs and shade measurements to establish a baseline.
- **Cleaning Your Teeth:** A professional cleaning could enhance results by removing plaque and tartar buildup.
- **Addressing Sensitivity:** If you have sensitive teeth, discuss options with your dentist to minimize discomfort during and after treatment.

### Expected Changes During Treatment

While undergoing teeth whitening, many people notice changes in their enamel and tooth sensitivity. Here’s what you might experience:

- **Initial Sensitivity:** Some individuals feel increased sensitivity as the whitening agent penetrates the enamel. This typically subsides after treatment.
- **Visible Results:** Depending on the method, you may see gradual changes starting from the first session. Professional treatments tend to yield faster results.
- **Color Variations:** Your teeth may appear whiter immediately, but some methods reveal more improvements over days as the process continues to work.

### Aftercare and Longer-Term Results

The look of your smile after treatment can be stunning but requires proper aftercare to maintain those results. Here’s what you should consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** After whitening, your teeth may be more susceptible to stains. Limit coffee, tea, red wine, and other staining foods for a few days.
- **Follow Up:** Schedule a check-up with your dentist to monitor the health of your teeth post-whitening. This will allow them to advise you on maintaining bright results.
- **Home Care Products:** Use whitening toothpaste or gels suggested by your dentist to help maintain brightness.

### Maintenance and Re-Touching

Maintaining your newly whitened smile requires commitment:

- **Regular Dental Visits:** Visit your dentist for cleanings and evaluations of your whitening progress every six months.
- **Touch-Up Treatments:** Some may benefit from periodic touch-ups with at-home kits or in-office sessions, especially if you consume staining foods and drinks regularly.
- **Consistency is Key:** Establish a whitening routine that suits your lifestyle and needs. Keeping a consistent whitening regimen can help with long-lasting results.

Understanding what to expect before and after teeth whitening can empower you to make the best choices for your smile. Whether you opt for in-office treatments or at-home kits, the goal remains the same: a brighter, more confident smile.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can have a remarkable impact on your smile and overall confidence. Real-life transformations showcase the dramatic differences between before and after treatments, highlighting how brighter teeth can enhance your appearance and even boost your self-esteem. Many people report feeling more attractive and approachable after undergoing teeth whitening procedures. Whether it’s for a special occasion or simply to feel better in your daily life, the results can be truly inspiring.

If I consume borax in like 3g dose once a month or something that’ll be fine right. I’ve heard of all it’s uses but ChatGPT keeps gaslighting me no matter how much I argue it says that it’s toxic asf and blah blah blah. Yet it agrees with me that boron is healthy. It then says that it contains “dangerous other compounds”. But the only compounds are boron water oxygen and sodium. It then told me the sodium levels are too high in borax. But table salt has 2X the sodium than boron. So then Im like well It says borax’s boron isn’t bio available which I don’t really believe. Apparently this stuff was workin like a charm back in the day for like pink eye and cancer and cleaning and teeth like baking soda wonder drug shit. Also I found this YouTube video with thousands of comments of people saying they shower with borax, wash their clothes, drink it for years in coffee, etc, and are all seem to be alive and kicking all good commenting. It’s weird to me we completely banned it, I get that it’s easy to overdose yourself with it but people still brush their teeth with fluoride DAILY and drink flouride water… Honestly you guys might be more open minded and helpful than other subreddits. I love psychedelic drug users they actually have open minds and fun opinions so maybe I’m in the right spot.

1hdzcbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/walkwithmetim/comments/1hdzcbx/vlogmas_day_13_crapland/,Vlogmas Day 13 - Crapland,"Well we've finally almost caught back up to the present day with the premiere of 'Lindumbs Do Lapland'. They're stuck in a queue at the airport and I'm willing to bet money that this is down to their own failure to properly prepare, much like the last time they attempted this trip. They try to push to the front of the queue, but are quite rightly told to get back in the line. This doesn't sit well with Tweedle Dim and Tweedle Dimmer, who could probably skip the plane and travel to Finland on the sheer buoyancy of their own inflated egos to be honest. Trigger warning: the levels of entitlement are off the charts in tonight's video - please look away if you have a rageful disposition. Gobshite makes no attempt to preserve the privacy of anyone in the queue, even going so far as zooming in on the 'trashy' individual who dared question their celebrity status and challenge their fashion choices. Gobbiscuit brays that ""this is not just any Christmas jumper!"" before revealing it's from Next. She's narrowly missed a defamation suit from M&S there. Though they might not be so lucky dodging a claim for emotional damages from 'trashy' woman after Dim's sick burn (""well you're full of Christmas cheer!""). 

Still in the line and we get a nice close up of AmLegs dissociating yet again. I'm surprised Gobbfeine isn't spacing out too as she repeats roughly 8000 times that she hasn't had a coffee yet (it's 8am). You'd imagine she was detoxing off class A's the way she's carrying on. I wonder if she's still breastfeeding and passing on all that caffeine to FP... No wonder he's looking torpid this morning. 

I nearly report the video for violent and repulsive content when we're forced to look at Dim's saggy butt getting on the plane. His arse is as flat and wobbly as Gobbo's singing. On the plane, he preens what's left of his sad, sparse barnet as Queen Gobby laments the rude, inconsiderate, and aggressive crowds in the airport. The call is clearly coming from inside the house, as she spends the entire flight performing a loud and animated one woman play in which she stars as hopelessly boorish hag who's hook nose is so ineffably large that she is cursed to smell all the aromas of those around her. As if her shit doesn't stink? She lives off coffee and fast food - I guarantee she fucking hums. 

I'm given a brief respite from this shitshow as an advert for Microsoft Flight Simulator starts up. No wait, that's Captain Dim filming out the plane window for us. Probably interesting to the internationally immobile that make up the majority of their audience. On a side note, Dim's skin is looking awfully bollockesque. I bet he uses 0SPF tanning oil when he's off on his jaunts. Judging by the state of that map graphic, Gobs could probably hook him up with a blurring filter or two. 

The plane lands safely in Finland despite being laden with the hefty weight of the Dimbles' heads. We're walking around the town when Gobby suddenly declares with striking profundity that she's not seen any of this before 😱😱😱. She is honestly the thickest person I've ever had the displeasure of listening to. Of course you haven't seen any of this before Gobhead - you weren't allowed on the flight last time remember? 

We see such Christmas miracles as an 'ice-sculpted manger' that's made out of wood, and Gobby notices that 'there is an ass in that nativity scene!'. And there's a couple of asses outside the scene too Gobs... 

Dim gives me the best Christmas present of all time: an image of him boohooing on a Finnish bench into his hot chocolate. He was sooooo sad that Gabby was too busy abusing Ryanair staff last time to join him. He doesn't look much happier now she's here though, as he spends much of this vlog either debating everything she says or just ignoring her entirely. 

After that lovely trip down memory lane with Sob with me Dim, we're back at 'Birmingham Christmas Market' (Gobshite is so egregiously uncultured), and we're still fucking moaning about coffee. We finally stop into a coffee shop, and after all that whinging Gobs proceeds to order a hot chocolate. I just cannot. 

Back outside, Finnish native Gobsuomi looks down her hooter at all the people on their holidays (as she is too). I'm starting to suspect she has brain damage from the assault to the senses that she endured on the plane. Richard Dimmond laughs at all the sledders and proclaims that the icy floor 'has no suspension'. The fact that back home Dimmond drives a car that's known for its suspension issues should tell you everything - this bozo has no idea what he's talking about. 

Dim and Gob's Excellent Adventure continues as they try to find somewhere to stuff their... Well... Gobs for the night. They're struggling, as there's not a McDonald's or KFC in sight. Our Lord FunPeas must be absolutely apoplectic without his daily bread (Greggs sausage roll). Unfortunately nobody has forewarned the Finns that they're being visited by Norfolk's answer to Peter Andre and Katie Price, and once again their lack of planning is positioned as a failing of others. God forbid the Lindumbs take some accountability for themselves. 

Let's hope tonight's vlog is just as eventful, although I'm predicting even more whinging in the snow personally! ❤️🐷

1hdzadw,https://www.reddit.com/r/lamedviv/comments/1hdzadw/mistress_sandy_oversees_sheilas_aka_slave_loser/,"Mistress Sandy Oversees Sheila's (AKA Slave Loser Girl) Penance Part 16. Constance, Katie And A Bitchsuited Layla Explain The Plan To Beat Ari To The Girls. Sandy And Sarah Establish Reasonable If Firm Dominance Over Slaves Zero And Bubblebutt (Sheila And Cindy). ","Sandy's perspective 

     ""Dear, for the moment you can raise your head and look me in the eye."" Katie magnanimously told Layla. The compact, powerful bitchsuited girl raised her head and mmmphed, ""Ank ou istrress atie.""

""Dear, in this company, even when you're bound as a slave, we're equals, Katie and Layla. When we're in our undercover roles, especially with my girls or Ari's, then we're Mistress Katie and Slave Border Bunny. I appreciate and respect your courage, Mistress Layla."" 

We'd gotten done watching the cellphone video where Layla assures us that being turned over to Mistress Katie is part of ""the plan"" to beat Ari, and that Katie had approached Dave about bringing down Ari, using Sheila, aka  Slave Zero, as bait. Dave came to Layla, making it clear that even with her belated consent, he did not feel comfortable making her do that. Layla wholeheartedly agreed, in fact volunteering herself. Dave was shocked and tried to demure, but her lover Constance sadly but determinedly backed her up.

We'd walked Border Bunny down to the beach picnic spot, Katie and Constance explaining the plan as we strolled along. 
We were right now laying down the blanket for the picnic. We were originally going to tether Border Bunny to a tree fifty yards down the beach so we could watch her while we ate, then feed her leftovers.

Katie insisted she eat with us, and even though she'd stay in the bitchsuit, Layla join us for the picnic. She insisted on  removing her hood and gag. She sat cross legged to Layla's right gently feeding her, and letting her drink  on request out of a thermos of fresh pineapple Juice with a straw in it as she told her tale.

She initially got involved with Ari using her hightech slave suited subs, Bubble Butt and Smelly Cunt, (Cindy and Vivian) as servers and entertainment at Ari's parties. She assured us both of them were volunteers, as were a few of her newer slaves. She'd presumed Ari's slaves were all volunteers at first. I exchanged looks with Constance and Nora. They knew from Sheila's and my stories, they weren't.

Then she talked about how the Slavegagger girls seemed to be forced into abusive relationships with their younger male co stars. She mentioned Brad and Emily, and I told her I was in a ""relationship"" with Brad when I was Ari's slave, and it wasn't voluntary. She looked nervous and nodded. ""Those young men treat those ladies awful, making them suck dick even when they're obviously sick and need a break to get the shoot done. Ordering them to smile when they're obviously very unhappy. Dragging the poor things off to private rooms for obvious reasons. Those men come back looking refreshed, while the poor women look used, sick and sad. A single tear or sob gets a vicious slap from one of the men. Then they're ordered to put on a fake happy face for the rest of the shoot""

""And that boy Chris, I thought his ""girlfriend"" Jaime, was too old for him, even though she's still a beautiful woman. I just happened to do a background check on both of them, she's that boy's biological mother! And he mistreats her and uses her just like the other boys use their women. His own mother!""

""And what they've done to that poor Wendy girl. I thought it was sus that they surgically altered her more then the other girls, made her a freakish joke. I saw pictures of a gorgeous young Asian woman. Now she's an obscene parody. They won't let her talk, just make her quack all the time, even when they're not shooting. And her eyes look so desperate and sad...""

""Then they ask if I'd like my girls to participate....that's a no. I'm not going to let them be sexually abused and humiliated by so called ""young men"" that are little more than overgrown boys...it seems a lot of Ari's ""bottom slaves"" aren't volunteers.""

I started ""Miss Green..."". She gently interrupted with a dazzling smile. ""Please, call me Katie, dear, we're all friends here."" I continued ""Katie...I assure you they're not volunteers. That bastard Brad raped me so savagely when I was eighteen I may never be able to bear children without endangering my life."" I almost felt sorry for that cunt Emily being forced to be ""his woman"" now. Almost.

Katie reached out take my left hand in both of hers. ""Dear, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I want to help you make sure Ari doesn't victimize another woman-or man, ever again."" She seemed so sincere. I wanted to believe.

I caught Constance's subtle, cautioning look. Being a naive, self involved dipshit had cost me my freedom, and extended my sister's slavery and suffering, and tore my family apart for years. Now so much more was at stake, Layla's freedom and maybe life, plus the slaves Ari was planning to ship off to snuff film makers, not just in the near future, but the further one,  as well. It would be so tempting to really believe ""Katie"" cared about me and Ari's other victims. But Davey had good instincts about folks, if he smelled a rat, it's because there likely was one.

Still, I had to act convinced. I made like I was wiping away a tear with my right as I gently pulled my left from her grasp. ""Thank you, Katie, that means so much. But what's happened has happened, it would be nice if you and Constance..."" I hastened to add ""And Layla would bring us up to speed.""

Katie said ""Brave and no nonsense, I like your little girl already Mistress Constance.""
The Black Domme was all business as she replied. ""And that's what we're doing for you two gals now, so listen up, my cute little Crackers.""

""Katie's Fetish Entertainment is going to be helping us with the second half of the Third season of the Perseverance. Her slave suited subs will guest star as Amazonian slaves. Layla's character, Gunny Perez, will be captured and put in a bitch suit by an Amazonian warrior princess played by Mistress Jasmin, who has quality, high tech slave suits literally at her disposal. We may even fit Sheila for a suit....IF she CONSENTS, NORA!""
I'd noticed Nora had started to get a look of evil glee at putting Sheila in a slave rig...now she looked crestsfallen and guilty that her sadistic designs on her former mentoress could be read and corrected so easily by our black Domme.

""We're looking to establish a relationship of amicable trust with Ari through Mistress Katie. Get her to trust us enough to take that tour she keeps cancelling because of our conflicts."" I remember the last ""conflict"" with Ari, the one surrounding my escape. Interesting how Caleb pursued us so intently off Ari's property, but made a truce so quickly when Dave brought up superior reinforcements. Almost like Ari knew what was going to happen because she was writing the script. Could we really beat her at her own game?

I shook my head. Dammit, she wasn't some invincible force, we could beat her! We had to, to stop her and salvage the lives we could, and save countless others from the clutches of her and her minions.

It suprised me when Layla spoke up. ""We're trying to get her to trust us enough to start bringing her bottom slaves in for extra slots on the Perseverance. I know it may be tempting for you girls to try and free them, or at least get them to admit on video they're not volunteers. They're suffering is sad, even I couldn't watch the Slavegagger series all the way through without getting sick, and y'all know I've seen some shit. But we're trying to save as many as possible, so those few girls will have to suffer a little longer so we can gain her trust. Understood, girls?""

Despite her humiliating position forced on her elbows and knees, her stern gaze tracked between the blondie and I, demanding a response. ""We understand Mistress Layla."" Despite her degraded position, and that we were ordering her to sniff flowers under our crops an hour ago, her authoritativeness makes it easy to refer to her as Mistress. Katie had a hand on her undercover peer's shoulder, nodding approval of Mistress Layla's wise admonitions to both of us.

""I may be forced to do something degrading-maybe even be a Slavegagger Girl for awhile."" The Mexican girl continued with self possession, despite the horrible thought.  Katie hastened to assure us ""You have my word I'll try to avoid that for her, girls."" Layla quietly let Katie interrupt, then continued. ""Nevertheless, if I'm forced to do some things that are nasty and humiliating to compromise Ari, you girls will not do anything unless it's cleared by Dave, Lara or Constance...right now they're  your leadership triad. We didn't go wrong saving Sheila...and you, Sandy, banking on Dave and Lara's leadership. And I'd trust Constance with my life, which I may be doing right now. I know both of you, little hot heads with massive ovaries, and poor impulse control. Both of you will follow our leadership on this, or be benched. And you know they won't hesitate to have Sarah and Sheila tie you to the bench to keep you there.""

I tried to suppress a giggle, I'm sure Sheila and Sara would eagerly tie either Nora, or I, or both up at a command from our current leadership council. But she was serious, and right. Nora and I were little hot heads, and to much was riding on this, Layla's life, a bunch of other slavegirls and maybe boys, too. I said quickly ""I'll follow the lead of Dave, Lara, and Constance, I trust it, but I will speak up if I feel we can rescue you from a bad spot and still achieve the mission."" Layla nodded then glared pointedly at a silent Nora.

Nora squirmed a little but met Layla's gaze. ""Same for...me."" Layla gazed harder at Nora, then softened. That was the best we were going to get out of her for now. I caught Layla's eyes to let her know I'd talk to my little blondie trailer trash friend later. We were both poor redneck girls, so on the same wavelength.

We decided to seal our pact by all putting our hands on Layla's bare shoulders to show solidarity. We all let out a loud ""Beat Ari!"" including Layla. As I watched Katie regag and hood Layla to lead her to her new Mistress, Jasmine, I hoped it would be enough. It just had to be!

Sandy's perspective, Ready Room, two days later

We're doing a script reading  today for the Perseverance episode where Gunny Perez is captured and made a bitchsuit slave by Amazonian Princess Machit. Jasmine and Nora are making Slave Border Bunny study the script in her bitchsuit. They're in one of Queen Of Mean's classrooms on our set being firmly overseen by Constance.

Alpha Sara and I have the Ready Room, and are overseeing the script reading for Slaves Zero and Mistress Katie's slave, Bubblebutt. The Slave was a thicc, pretty Vietnamese Milf named Cindy Phu. Apparently, she'd decided to cede control of her life and sub for awhile after a stressful divorce. According to Katie, she was very happy being the Alpha slave now of Katie's stable, especially since her old domme Vivian, was made the permanent bottom slave of said stable. That was Katie's official story, which I reminded myself needed to be taken with a grain of salt.

Both Sheila and Cindy were kneeling naked on cushions on the floor, their bathroom buckets wedged between their upper thighs. Their arms were tied to the armrests of the chair in front of them with Nora's padded zipties. They both wore zipper hoodmasks zipped shut over softballs stuffed in their mouths. They had scripts that had been plunked down on the chair seat in front of them by Alpha Sarah, who would tutor both slaves on their parts. Sarah looked very domme like in her black cyborg catsuit and peaked cap.

I stood in front of them wearing more traditional Domme attire then I usually do. Black thigh high boots and fishnet stockings, black silver studded mini skirt and blouse ensemble. Black lipstick and eyeshadow, with a peaked cap on my head. Despite a traditional domme appearance meant to frighten, I tried to smile benevolently down on the restrained slaves to reassure them they were safe with us.

Nominally, I was in charge of this crew as Mistress Sandy, but I was sharing my command with Alpha Sarah in practice. The normally serene Asian sub just had more experience as a fetish actress than I for me to ignore. Plus her leadership experience as a Navy officer made her better at controlling subs with a firm, but fair hand. The fact that Sheila was her best friend didn't stop her from dishing out stern discipline to bottom slave Zero when it was needed.

Since Sheila had consented to be put in a hightech slavesuit, only for Perseverance scenes, we decided to use that when we needed Amazonian slave extras for shoots.
We took Sheila's measurements, and Katie agreed to subsidize a custom suit for her at reduced price. 

In the scene we were studying today, Sheila and Cindy would be civilian hostages forced into slave suits and having to flank Princess Machit's throne. We'd use the suit's embedded electrical network to freeze them in place to either side of the throne. They were supposed to try to shout warnings at our heros when Princess Machit contacted the Perseverance for Hostage negotiations.

Princess Machit would smirk and activate their inflatable gags with her remote. Then she'd punish them with the suit's electro network, which shocked their bare breasts and pussies via connected leads. The suits had a real life capability to do this, but Dave insisted it be disconnected for shoots, we'd rely on the girls' acting ability to simulate torment. 

They were warned if Director/Screenwriter Lara was unhappy with their acting, they would get electrobuttplugs, set to low, poked up their cute rears to encourage them. It still got uncomfortable after ten minutes. Something to avoid.

How did I know? All of us, except for Constance, had to spend an hour strapped in Sarah's charging dock naked with that thing buzzing up our butt. The only reason Constance didn't have to do it was because she'd had to endure a much more powerfully charged one as Daci's slave. Dave, Constance and Lara even insisted Jasmine had to do it if she wanted to use it on slaves on our set. She grumbled, but Nora and I volunteered to be her dommes to get her into it.

While it buzzed up her butt, I sat on her face and made her eat me out, wearing nothing but a pink tanktop. I cranked the dock so she was horizontal and straddled her face facing towards her feet. Nora actually licked and stimulated her pussy with her tongue and a vibrator, edging her without letting her come, like Constance taught us.

When the buzzer started to get uncomfortable, she started to slack off, but I had attached clamps to her nipples, with chains I pulled like reins to encourage  her. At about the half hour mark, I came all over her face and switched places with Nora, who eagerly unzipped her Stellar Compact coveralls for her turn. I took my place edging our little mideast cutie, not letting her come as she services Nora.

Towards the end of the hour, Nora simply cuts lose with girl come all over Jasmine's face with a loud cry. I decide to reward hajii slave by letting her come. Heck, I'm ready to come again...

We both move to wipe off her pretty face, but she licks at the girl come around her mouth eagerly and suggestively. Nora unstraps her arms, but then grabs her wrists and firmly pins them over her head. I think about unstrapping her legs, but she's easier to control if they're still pinned. I do shut off the butt plug, as her time is up and she's earned it. 

I slide up the table as Nora moves aside so I can stare in the face of Jasmine. The Mistress doesn't seem to upset at being subdued by her peers, though that must be a stretch for her since technically, Nora's a slave and I'm a Gofer. Still she looks excited as I move in to kiss her, and taste the mingling of I and Nora's girl fluid in her mouth.

""Okay, my horny little sluts. I was young once, too. But we got work to do, so if Mistress Jasmine's indoc time with the butt plug is done, unstrap her ass and get her cleaned up. The three of you have thirty minutes to get your cute butts presentable and in the Ready Room.""

We looked up to see Mistress Constance in her Blue Coveralls, in Character as the Perseverance's Lead Helmsman and Operations Officer, Lt. Rachael Willis, former fighter pilot. It was a little out of character for one of the ""good guys"" to wield a riding crop, like she did. As our current Executive Domme it was perfectly intimidating and in character. Especially paired with the glare she gave the three horny little sluts in her charge who got carried away in ""Girl Play"". Was I wrong to hope Mistress Constance would make her bad little girls pay later? Alas, my fantasy of the black formerly straight domme punishing us nasty young bi bitches hasn't come true yet.

Back to the present. Alpha Sarah is seated behind both slaves bare bums in a comfortable rolling chair. Wielding a crop across her lap as she finishes explaining the scene to our charges.

""So the last scene ladies, Princess Machit has set the timer on a bomb on her makeshift throne. She's escaped with her prize ""Gunny Perez"" in a bitchsuit and is sacrificing the two of you in the most undignified way possible, per Amazonian custom. We'll half deflate your gags and adust your suit's necks so you can lock eyes on the bomb. Remember ladies, big panicked eyes, frightened mmmphs, you're two terrified trapped civilian hostages. You'll just need to make it convincing for two forty five second takes. Commander Gail wants to rescue the hostages, but Lt. Commander Kang tells her they won't disarm the bomb in time. They have to tragically watch you two blown to smithereens begging for rescue.""

Sheila chuffed. Since her demotion and Lara's promotion to Chief Screenwriter, she could get petty when she didn't like a scene and didn't get any input into it.We usually still tried to give her an advisory chop, but sometimes production schedule meant that she wasn't even consulted, we didn't have the time. It didn't seem to affect her relationship with the Indian girl behind closed doors. But during production, she could be as snarky a little bitch as she could get away with.

Alpha Sarah wasn't in the mood to let her get away with much today. ""I'm not asking for your opinion, Slave Zero, I'm telling you what I expect. Is that clear, Slave?"" Her cool voice and calm demeanor belied her stern words. She sipped a cup of coffee casually with her left, but I noticed her right was tensed on the crop.

I met Sheila's eyes sensing she was going to be stubborn, even if her best friend striped her. I wasn't in the mood, myself, and we didn't have the time, to indulge my stubborn big sister today. ""Slave Zero, you owe Alpha Sarah an acknowledgement, and an apology, now."" We locked gazes and I very visibly prepared to give my Alpha Slave the signal to start whipping.

Again, Sheila in bondage tends to break faster. She cast her eyes down and obeyed me. ""Uh untersand, uh suwwy, Miswess Sarah."" Sarah smiled brightly ""Apology accepted, sweetie."" She assured her friend.

I decided to be concillitory now that she was obedient. ""I know you like to be consulted on scenes, but this one is so minor we didn't have the time. Tonight we can meet with Lara and get your input on what you think we need to do better."" Her eyes met mine, grateful this time. ""Ank ou, Iswess Sandy."" She mmphed.

I patted her head. ""Your welcome sweetie. Alpha Sarah will turn your script pages and hydrate you when you asked. Bathroom break in a half hour. We'll wipe you with charmin and baby wipes, dump your buckets, then continue."" Two disappointed, muffled groans from our zippered mouthed gimp slavegirls.

""Problem ladies?"" I asked ""I presume you both need to go now?"" Two mmmphed ""Ess, Miswess Andy."" I looked them each in the eye, hands on hips, turning my head left and right looking both Zero and Bubble Butt in the eyes. 

""Honest truth, girls, is it an emergency, or can you hold it?"" They both reluctantly mmmphed they could hold it.

I sighed folded my arms and decided to explain to them, even though I didn't have to. ""Girls, we're on a strict schedule. If I let you go in your buckets, we have to dry your pussies and wipe your asses. Then clean your buckets and wipe them out. The former is for your comfort and hygiene. The latter is for all our comfort so this place doesn't smell like a shithole. That takes time off the schedule that Mistress Lara alloted us. I have to explain if we fall behind, not either of you. I'd never deny you girls permission to go in a real emergency. But ladies, if you can please hold it for half an hour, I ask that you do.""

Sheila started with the ""Weese, Miswess Andy."" repeatedly. Then Bubblebutt/Cindy started copying her. I rolled my eyes and looked at the Ready Room ceiling. Why did they have to be this way? I didn't want to abuse them like Ari or Nora would, but why couldn't they treat my kindness with a little more respect? Especially Sheila, she knows I try to treat subs like people, now.

When my eyes came back down they fell on Sarah on her feet. Her feet were spread shoulder width apart, hands on hips. Her scowl swung left to Zero and Right to Bubblebutt. The slaves, oblivious of their Alpha's ire, kept pleading with me to let them go even though they both admitted to me they could hold it. I suppressed a giggle, not wanting to tip the slaves as to what would happen next.

The crop was holstered on her left hip. She raised her left hand behind Sheila's hooded head, and her right behind Bubblebutt's. She opened hand slapped the back of both their heads. They were so stunned they quieted down.

The former Navy girl cross drew her crop with her right. She tapped the seat of the chair in front of Sheila making her script copy jump. Then did the same to Cindy Phu. She went back and forth between them for a moment. Tap. Tap. Tap. Two pairs of pretty slave eyes tracked the crop's trajectory with fear.

""You whiny little cunts. Mistress Sandy worked out this system for you, to keep you as clean and comfortable as possible. She wants us all to work in an environment that doesn't smell like a shithouse, so she was willing to take turns with me emptying and cleaning out your buckets, even though as our domme she could made us slaves do all the work.""

""I'm especially disapponted in you Slave Zero. She made mistakes in the past, but she's fought to make sure you get the best care possible as a slave. She's made mistakes as a domme, but so have you and all of us. She was willing to take you home when she felt we went too far. You need to set a better example for Bubblebutt and any other slaves who come through here. In fact, I'm going to hold you to it from now on.""

Both slaves started to speak through their zippered shut mouths, it seemed to apologize. Sarah holstered her crop, and held up a hand even though the subs couldn't see her. ""Just shut it, I don't want to hear from either of you.""

She dragged her rolling chair around and positioned it in between Zero and Bubblebutt's chairs. I backed up to give her room. She righted both their scripts on the seat of the chair and flounced in the chair. ""Study your fucking scripts! I don't want to hear from either of you for the next half hour except if you need me to turn a page or some water!"" Both slaves hastened to bow their heads and read quietly as their Alpha ordered them.

Sarah looked at me over her right shoulder, smiled, and winked. I smiled and winked back. She had our two cute little helpless bare butts well in hand. With a right hand woman like Alpha Slave Sarah Ok Kim to control these two, being in charge of scriptreading sessions would be easy, a regular cakewalk.

Aloud I said ""Alpha Slave Kim. Thanks for correcting these two slaves. I'm going to take a leisurly bathroom break, then I'll come back to relieve you if you want."" Still smiling, the graceful Asian girl gave a slight head bob and said ""Of course, please take your time, please,  Mistress Sandy.""

I felt a little bad as I left the Ready Room to use the loo, knowing my sister and our guest bottom slave were a bit uncomfortable. Dammit, I gave them a chance to tell me if it was an emergency! A couple of grown women should be able to hold it for a half hour, for a plan that kept things on schedule, while maximizing hygiene and comfort for us all. I decided not to worry about their relatively light discomfort. I started humming to myself on the way to the girl's room.

“Mutant Fucker!”

“Nazi Bastard!”

“Traitor!”

“Fascist!”

Ah, the sound of democracy at work. Boris smiled as he took in the scene, like two competing oceans held apart by a thin steel breakwater. The hangar was filled to bursting, on one side was a sea of purple armbands and eyes full of old hate, a rising tide of red armbands and faces awash in youthful zeal swelled from the other. Each side pressed as close as they dared to the line of sentrybots that separated the groups and held the hot blooded at bay with the certain menace of cold steel.

Brushing aside the idle fancy, he brought himself to the business at hand. The numbers were good. He refreshed himself with a sip of coffee from his thermos and returned to his scribblings. 

Yes, the numbers were looking good but still not good enough, the engineers had come around to a man and the mess specialists were coming along nicely. As they had fucking better given all the assurances those jumped-up griddle jockeys had wheedled out of him. The civil service administrators were abstaining mostly, but the lower ranking bureaucrats were tilting red.  The science divisions were holding steady purple with only a few defections from the young and the bureaucrats. The officer corps was the same story, steady purple with a few notable exceptions. It was exactly as he’d expected. The Purists had a slight lead but could still be overtaken.

It all came down to the soldiers.

He looked up from his notebook and scanned the crowds once more. A couple of young toughs had escalated from invectives to fists and had earned a hail of rubber bullets for their trouble. Each man was pulled back to his respective side and carried off by his fellows for medical care. It was the seventh such incident of the day.

If these periodic eruptions of violence bothered the three individuals standing at impromptu stage in the rear of the hangar, Boris hadn’t seen an indication yet. Orwich, the Purist representative seemed as cold and stiff as her robots. Freeman, their man, dismissed the renewed violence with a roll of the eyes. Doctor Colburn, the highest ranking neutral, retained his look of permanent indigestion. Still the roll call carried steadily on.

“Private Brandice, John C.” The man in question was spat out of the red mass in a series of backslaps and shouts of encouragement. He made his way up to the stage where he stated his choice, to the resounding cheers of the Reformer mob and hisses of the Purists. The choice was confirmed by the three members of the Electoral Observation Committee and the large sign displaying the current vote counts was changed accordingly. Once released, Brandice scurried back to the safety and obscurity of the Reformer blob, no doubt eager to get away from the looks of scorn directed his way by several of his superior officers on the opposite side of the room. Then the process started anew.

A little bit more respect for the democratic process wouldn’t go amiss, his lips fell into a scowl. The whole thing was a farce, a gross parody of democracy built on peer pressure and intimidation more than reasoned discourse and personal choice. A shake of the head and another scribble in his notebook, it couldn’t be helped. Any discussions of a proper secret ballot had foundered on issues of how to count and who would count and accusations of rigging. An open roll call vote of every adult member of the Enclave was only barely tenable as a compromise.

The lower enlisted were relatively divided. They ran younger and thus were less indoctrinated into the old orthodoxy of genetic purity that had been treated as gospel on the Rig and more enamored to what they viewed as blazing their own trail. On the other hand they had all been imprinted with tails of wastelander barbarity, of the fall of Navarro and the Treachery of the Rig, by the veterans that made up the drill sergeant cadres. The precinct captains assigned to this group had peeled off a few commitments from the lowest echelons but corporals and above had remained stiffly uncommitted despite the variety of incentives his people had offered.

These men, Douglas had insisted in their debates on the subject, wouldn’t be swayed with promises of actual pay and weekend liberties in Reno. They would follow their leaders, not the distant officers, but the NCOs.

That had been the toughest nut to crack. Approaches by his precinct captains had been rebuffed with everything short of outright violence. They weren’t a total loss, Douglas was a soldier with over a decade of combat experience, that gave him a bit of cache, and their ranks were peppered with Granite Company veterans integrated since their arrival from Eureka.

The numbers still weren’t good enough.
They needed the veterans of Navarro, those leather-faced hard-eyed men who carried a burning hatred in their hearts for the wasters who had forced them to ignominious flight and a perpetual distrust of the superior officers who had wasted the lives of the men and women under their command. If they had the veterans, then they won.

“Sergeant Major Farr, Maxwell Q.”

He looked up from his scribbling, now they would see what Dornan’s word actually meant.

A man made his way out of the crowd of purists. Tall, with ramrod straight posture, his very presence seemed to clear the way for him. Boris couldn’t see his face but he knew it was a monstrous thing, natural olive tones contrasted with pale skin stretched taut where the grafts had been placed. Farr’s had been one of the last vertibirds off the rig and hadn’t made the minimum safe distance in time. Half his body covered in third degree burns and clinging to a piece of debris, Farr had swam for 130 miles through open ocean before being picked up by one of the search and rescue patrols. He’d been fresh out of a recuperative bio-gel tank when the NCR and the Brotherhood enacted their siege of Navarro. He'd lost the use of his left arm to an NCR fragmentation grenade in that fight.

If there was ever a man fueled by vengeance, it was him.

If they could get him…

Farr marched to the stage, there was none of the backslapping or words of encouragement that had followed others. Any attempt at insult or mockery was suffocated in the throat of its author by the pass of that monstrous gaze. For the first time since the elections began, silence permeated the hangar. The only noise was the whirr of the sentrybots and the steady crack of boots crashing down on concrete.

Farr halted in front of the stage and brought himself to attention. “Sergeant Major Farr, Maxwell Q. reporting sirs!”

The voice resounded through the cavernous space. For all the spectacle, the committee carried out its task in the same way it had for the thousands that had cast their votes without such theatrics. 

The sergeant major made his choice.
The room erupted in fury and joy.

Boris closed his notebook and smiled.

1hdz7n3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hdz7n3,Day 14. Amateur review,"While writing this review, I’m staring at the window of our boat surfing the Kattegat sea, passing by Fredrikshavn, on the way to Copenhagen. It’s foggy, our boat is 1h delayed, and today I figured out that mobile data one uses in the sea isn’t treated as EU roaming and costs a fortune :) But that’s a completely different story.

Here, we’re speaking coffee. And today’s pick was unusual on several levels. First, because of traveling, I tasted it blindly a day early in the comfort of my home kitchen. So I had no chance to evaluate my discoveries against the actual description on the calendar website. Second, I was very surprised to find out that today’s pick evoked a similar emotional response to Day 13—a sense of intrigue, curiosity, and unconventionality. Despite its distinct aromatic profile when brewed, this coffee left me with a familiar mix of surprise and uncertainty. And while I appreciate another layer of the variety it brings to the calendar, I couldn’t help but feel that following yesterday’s non-conventional pick, I was expecting something a bit more classic. Also, because I had to taste Day 13 and Day 14 on the same day, perhaps the short interval between tastings influenced my impression. And this, to be honest, might have lead to a mistake in the process. Read on to find out what I mean. But anyway, I think this cup was truly unique and worth revisiting later when I’m back from the short trip.

**BREW**:

Because this pick still wasn’t open in the calendar at the time of tasting, I didn’t get any instructions on how to brew it best. Today, already on 14th, looking at the calendar’s page for this coffee, things are nowhere more clear - the page simply doesn’t contain any instructions. Anyway, I opted for the same brew method we had for day 13 for this pick as well.

  -	**Filter**: Abaca
  -	**Grind Size**: 25 clicks on Comandante
  -	**Total Brew Time (TBT)**: 2:26

**ROAST**:

The roast appeared lighter in tone than Day 13 and comparable to Day 12, maintaining a light roast level that suggested a nice, potentially fruity cup with some acidity. Though the aroma and flavor told a different story.

**AROMA**:

  - **From the Canister**: Unfortunately, like yesterday, the canister wasn’t airtight. I have a feeling that the second batch, that9 started yesterday on Day 13 uses canisters different from the first 12 days. And it doesn’t help, really. We’ll see tomorrow. But the aroma was underwhelming, dominated by faint **cardboard** notes with only a trace of coffee. Technically, this pick again smelled nothing right off the canister suggesting the beans were exposed to the oxygen for too long. Unfortunately.
  - **Ground Coffee**: When the beans were grounded, the aroma transformed briefly (just right off the grinder) into something unexpected and intriguing: **spices** and **tropical fruits**. However, this profile was fleeting and faded almost immediately, leaving little behind.
  - **Brewed Coffee**: The brewed aroma was, to be honest, completely unexpected in a very positive way—**sweet**, **candy-like**. Surprisingly, it was almost unrecognizable as coffee. It reminded me of a bag of **marshmallows**, **caramel**, and **syrup**, creating a delightful but unconventional experience. And, conveniently enough, I did have a can of marshmallows in my kitchen to compare. Yes, what jumped off the coffee server after brewing, was precisely a bunch of marshmallows. So delicious. And this is where I started questioning myself whether I made a mistake in my tasting. We had a honey-processed coffee for Day 13, but I get the marshmallow notes in Day 14? Can it be that I messed up my coffee jars after grinding and brewed Day 14 as Day 13 and vice verse here? Clearly, I will have to brew both of these coffees again to double-check. Please leave a note below if you think that that’s the case.

**TASTE**:

When smelling the aroma right after brewing, the cup suggested it should be mellow, syrup-like experience with a lot of sweetness and boldness. That’s where this coffee too another unexpected turn—just when you think you “get” it, it makes you reconsider all your senses and expectations. Really great. However, can be frustrating if all you want is a predictable, reliable cup of coffee. Because this cup, contrary to expectations, was light, soothing, and floral, with prominent notes of **rosehip** (yes, again!), **black currant**, **blackberry** and a medley of other flavors that were difficult to pin down. I suspect, it would a perfect, solid cold brew choice on a hot summer day. But there wasn’t much sweetness in the taste contrary to the aroma promises. At the same time, the combination of floral taste and candy-like aromatic characteristics made it very interesting, pleasant, and rounded experience.

There was one interesting thing I noticed about this coffee, though. Much like the aroma, the taste carried one particular element that didn’t traditionally belong in coffee. And I think I would say it was the **ozone** note. You know, like the one you get in the air in summer right before the showering rain? That was the feeling I’ve gotten here, which only amplified my wish to get it on a hot summer day.

**NOTES:**

Day 14 brought another unconventional coffee experience, similar to Day 13 in its ability to provoke curiosity but distinct in its profile. While it wasn’t what I would’ve expected after the previous pick, I can’t deny that it was intriguing. And that smell of the brewed cup! Not much resembling coffee, but so sweet!

I do wish there had been a return to something more classic after Day 13’s non-conventional cup, before we get to this pick, but perhaps that’s part of the calendar’s charm—keeping us on our toes and challenging our expectations. Just like this coffee—once you think you “get” it, this calendar challenges your expectations. Great if you like to be challenged and are ready to explore. Not so much if you just want to relax and enjoy.

This coffee, just like Day 13, is one I’ll revisit when I return, as I suspect the short interval between tastings may have skewed my impression. For now, it stands as a unique and surprising addition to the journey.

**INTERESTING FACT:**

Marshmallow-like and candy-sweet aromas in coffee are often linked to specific compounds produced during natural or honey processing. These processes allow sugars in the coffee cherry to infuse the beans, sometimes resulting in candy-like flavors. While it’s uncommon for coffee to be so distinctly sweet, it’s a testament to the diversity of profiles coffee can offer when grown and processed with care.

And now, after I checked what today’s pick was, I’ve become very curious and started checking what could cause this in a washed coffee. It turns out that the Kenyan factories often use extended fermentation times, which can intensify sweetness and floral complexity, occasionally evoking candy-like qualities.

So, if I didn’t screw up and it was really Day 14 that I tasted as Day 14 :) this showcases how a traditionally vibrant and clean Kenyan coffee can surprise you with unexpected notes, like marshmallow, even when it’s not listed in the official tasting notes.

1hdz4zb,https://i.redd.it/p37uw2v35s6e1.png,I feel Kashish regrets fighting with KV...,"Idk what went wrong between them but It was kashish who got close with KV before DV. And tbh I liked their conversation and fun banters. 

But this game game in her mind made her think that she is not going to be the priority in that group. So she supported rajat in coffee task and rajat backstabed her the very next day 😭😭.

Then when she went to DV to clear everything that happened in the past and move on. But that was not honest. She was like ladna hai lad le dost Banna hai dost ban beech ka mat rakh which is ignore. And ignoring someone is the worst thing you can do to someone in BB house. She should have just apologised with honesty and let go of everything, instead of this tone of giving DV an ultimatom.

After this, all progress she made in the house went to shit and was completely lost. She woke up when Farah gave her a wake up call. And now she is part of this group which idk if we can even call it a group because nobody trust the head Rajat 💀. 

So, why I think she regrets her parting ways with KV is that because I never see her happy when she is sitting with rajat gang. I always feel that she doesn't belong here. She has much more potential but it's getting wasted.

Because she is not part of the main narrative which is tough for wild cards to do but DV has done that perfectly. Instead of making a half baked third front and be with rajat who can flip anytime. He chose to be with the person who he vibes with.

Also, kashish feels so envy of eisha. It's pretty evident. Not because she wants Avinash or something but the bond that eisha share with avinash. That is what kashish crave for

And let me tell you, it’s like living in a world where feelings are those awkward relatives you avoid at family gatherings. This is what i feel about my feelings now , which by the way don't even exist  and  are so unknown, even  my own emotions are confused about them!

Emotional Blindfolds:  with alexithymia i have a unique power—I can walk into a room and NOT feel the awkward tension! It’s like wearing emotional blindfolds, but the downside? You still awkwardly wave at the emotional wallflower in the corner.

The ""Feeling"" Dictionary: While everyone else is flipping through their emotional thesaurus, i with alexithymia is  stuck on “Happy, Sad, Angry, and... uh, what’s that one with the puppy?” my emotional range is basically ""It’s fine"" and “Not fine.”

The Ultimate Chill Pill: If you’re ever in a high-stakes emotional situation, just call me "" your alexithymic friend""!
I'll  be completely unfazed when you spill coffee on my favorite shirt—probably because i didn’t realize i had a favorite shirt in the first place!

Award-Winning Misdirection: Ever tried to express your feelings? It’s like trying to explain a meme to your grandparents. “So, you see, it’s funny because... wait, let me Google ‘emotional expression’ first!”

Emotional GPS Malfunction: “Turn left at sadness, then right at confusion. Recalculate route once you hit existential dread.” Navigating emotions is a bit like trying to get directions from a GPS that only speaks in riddles.

Incredible Poker Faces: If poker was an emotion-based game, alexithymics would be champions. My face stay as blank as an unsaved Word document, making bluffing impossible... or is it?

Group Texts Are a Minefield: “How’s everyone feeling?” Ah, the dreaded question! Cue the silence while everyone else shares their deep feelings, and i reply with a simple, “I’m breathing.”

Emotional Hangovers: You know that feeling when you’ve laughed so hard you can’t breathe? Imagine never experiencing that because you can’t connect the dots between laughter and joy.

The Ultimate Icebreaker: “So, tell me about your feelings…” Cue the tumbleweed. It’s the ultimate test of friendship! If they stick around after that question, they’re a keeper.",1,1734166834.0,u_Awkward-Shame-25,0,1.0,False

And someone reminded me of this. 

""But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire."" 
- Jesus, Matthew 5:22

And now I am sorry. 

I thought I should delete the angry post. Maybe I still will.  But perhaps my apology should show what I am apologizing for.  I said what I said.  And now I am in danger of the judgement day I hoped for others.  What a hypocrite I am.

I am so exmormon.  I left in senior year of high school so I could make love with my first.  It was magical.  I was crazy about him.  Too crazy. I'm bipolar but never knew til recently.  Iykyk.  I smoke both stogies, I am a recovering alcoholic, and I drink coffee like it's water.  In those disposable cups too, so bad for the environment. I eat pork and don't exercise or drink water.  I don't go to church and I don't even go to AA meetings like I should.

But I study the scriptures. Too much. To an unhealthy degree perhaps. I listen to old conference talks and read the Joseph Smith papers. I listen to all the exmo podcasts religiously and dream of one day being on Mormon Stories.  Mine is more a bipolar story but definitely Mormon in background. 

I guess you could say I'm MIPO.  

I wish I could be President of the Church for a year and see what you guys think.  I wouldn't do anything for the first year, just learn the ropes - get a good grasp on where the finances are at, how the organization functions from the top, etc.  Then I'd DOGE it.  First things first:

Discontinue pay for General Authorities.  All are now a three to five year volunteer position.

The First Presidency is elected by tithe-payers every 4 years. Also volunteer positions. They appoint the General Authorities. Positions are open to all regardless of age, gender, or sexual orientation, and of course skin color.

Discontinue all building of new temples.  If we must insist that the temple rites are sacred and essential, then they can be done in the Bishop's office.  Let everyone have their own wedding in the chapel. Wear whatever clothes you like, if you like the traditional temple clothing, great. If you have something else in mind, go for it. 

Repurpose existing temples into Word of Wisdom Wonderlands where addicts can come be healed.

I'd love to start buying up the poorest areas of every city and completely rebuild them. All affordable housing and as nice as our temples are.  ""And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones."" - Isaiah 54 

And have Yeezy Ideation Centers in walking distance to every resident.

Sorry I probably lost you on that last one.  But I'd ask Ye if he'd like to do that. Hell, I'd probably just hand him the keys and let him run the whole show if he wanted it.

But anyway. Sorry, maybe the Brethren have a plan for all that money.  Maybe they plan to invest in the AI infrastructure that will free the whole world.

Anyway, I'm rambling. I was angry with my Brethren and I am sorry.

Don't be angry with me.

Matthew 6

9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.


The Lord's Prayer in 3 Nephi 13 is as follows:

""Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name"" 
""Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven"" 
""And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors"" 
""And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil"" 
""For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen""

# TLDR

Below is my pitch of a Sidemen Survivor video(s). 14 people. 3 days. 1 winner. Day 1: Split into two tribes, 4 challenges, 4 people voted out. Day 2: merged into on tribe, 4 challenges, 5 people voted out. Day 3: 3 challenges, 3 voted out, Final 2 pitch case to win.

With all the gameshow and reality tv type ideas they have, I reckon a Sidemen Survivor would work great. Here are my thoughts and how I would plan it. I assume they already have this in their list of ideas but either think it wouldn't sell well or is not worth the cost/effort so I've laid out how I would do it that works best for all players and viewers.

# What is Survivor?

(skip section if you already know how Survivor works).

The basic premise is a group of people are stuck on an island and live there together. They compete in challenges each episode and the winner of the challenge wins immunity (cant be voted out that round). They all then go to tribal council (a group discussion lead by the host) and at the end of the episode vote a person out the game. That person then joins the jury (out the game but watches the tribal council). This continues until there are 2/3 people left in the game. The finalist then plead their case to the jury (people that have been voted out) and the jury then vote for who wins the game. The jury aspect of Survivor is the most interesting and is why I watch it over all other reality type tv. It brings into the game the personal stuff which makes it a social and strategic game with how to get to the end and win.

The game starts of with 18 people split into two tribes. The two tribes compete in a challenge each episode and the winning team get a reward (typically food). The losing team goes to tribal council and they have to vote someone out. The tribe phase continues for a few episodes until they merge, where they then compete individually. The person that wins the individual challenge is immune from being voted out that round.

# The Game

So typically Survivor has two phases: Tribe phase and the individual phase. So the game starts with two tribes and they compete as teams for a few rounds and then they merge and compete individually. I would do something similar; Start with 2 tribes of 7 and then merge after 4 votes (end of day 1) so you merge the group with 10 people.

The game loop is: Challenge (+Reward), strategize/discuss, tribal council, vote player out.

Following this game loop with the challenges and rewards listed below should work giving plenty of time for the boys to be the boys but still make it a competitive game.

# The Players

Typically a Survivor season has 18+ people. I think it would work great with 14 people. So the 7 Sidemen and 7 friends.

# The Host

Who hosts? The obvious is StevenTries. This works.

But to make it a little different, possibly someone who's a survivor alumni. Someone like a Tyson Apostol or Rob Cesternino who both have survivor podcasts and have played multiple times. They'll be able to help but a little worried with the chemistry with the boys.

# The Challenges

Survivor is known for its big production type challenges but for Sidemen Survivor the challenges can be simple. We don't want challenges lasting more than 10-15mins because of the time constraint. We also need the challenges to be a mix of skills. Day 1 is team challenges. Days 2 and 3 are individual challenges. I've split challenges into team and individual. The order is the way I would have it but can be messed with (except the last individual one).

**Team**

* Hold the plates: Team is in a circle and have arms stretched out to their side with hands touching person next to them. Between their hands is a plate they have to hold up. Team with a plate left standing wins
* Egg-on-spoon race: One at a time go across balance beam with egg on spoon. Finish first = win.
* Word puzzle: They have all the letters scrambled up to spell out a phrase. Would need big boards and letters to make it visual for audience.
* Crossbar Challenge: All members of team have to hit crossbar to win

**Individual**

* (Bonus challenge) Touchy Subject: Its like a MoreSidemen game where hosts asks a question like 'Which player thinks they are the smartest' and the players vote. Person with most votes loses a life. 3 lives lost and your out.
* Balance: Balance on narrow beam for longest
* Tyre flip: Flip tyre some distance. First to finish line wins
* Trivia/general knowledge quiz
* 3d puzzle: Something like the cube puzzle in the real life among us.
* Target Practice: Some form of challenge where they throw or shoot something to knock something else down
* Slide puzzle: Quite visual and I think works well
* Stacking: Stack blocks up to a certain height. First one to get there wins.
* (Final) Firemaking: Classic Survivor thing. Have to make a fire big enough to burn a string using flint and raw material

# Rewards

Winning a challenge comes with a reward. Rewards can be kept pretty simple, mainly comfort or food. I've laid out the rewards in what I think the order should be after each challenge:

* (Team) Coffee/Tea each (maybe with biscuits too)
* (Team) Burger each (just burger. no fries or drink or side)
* (Team) Sides full meal each
* (Team) Get to sleep in caravan
* Coffee/Tea and pastry for winner
* Pizza for winner+ 3 others of winners choice
* Big meal for winner + 2 others
* Sleep in caravan for winner + 1 other
* Full breaky for winner+ 1 other
* Food for winner + 1 other
* Food for winner

# Miscellaneous

Survivor has other gamey things to add to the excitement or just to shake things up. The main one being **hidden immunity idols**. Its typically hidden in the jungle for players to find. The person who has it can play it to save themselves from being voted out for a vote. This should be added in. Adds to the scavenger hunting bit when they search for food. I would also have a double elimination round just to shake things up on day 2 (on 2nd vote of day 2?).

# Logistics

This is probably the toughest bit. Imo the game would be 3 days: Day 1 is tribes and days 2 and 3 are individual. 4 votes on day 1, 4 votes on day 2 (with a double elimination to switch it up) and day 3 has 3 votes plus the vote to crown the winner. The 3 day format would work for a 3 video release schedule around a bank holiday - 3 night special event(?).

**Location**

In the show they are on an island. An island would work but so would a large field with some forest area. The forest area would be the campsite and the field would be for setting up challenges because that needs space.

**Campsite**? Yeh none of the boys want to sleep outside. That's fine. Survivor is more of a social strategic game now a days. The survival aspect of it we can shortcut to make it more fun for players. They can have tents (they set up on day 1 which would be good content) and the reward on the last challenge of the day can be getting to sleep in a caravan bed or something. The tents can have some cushy padding to make it more comfy. Its only two nights. They can deal with tents.

**Challenges** will need a lot of space to setup. Ideally all the challenges are setup prior to the game starting so less faf during. Most challenges should be relatively cheap. Can make one challenge a day very fancy possibly.

**Food** they can be given a bag of rice which they cook up at camp (again would be jokes seeing them lighting a fire to cook rice). Each challenge will have a food reward. Plus you can hide food around the forest/campsite so they can 'forage' for a squashies pack or snickers. We don't want to starve them but a little work for the food would do. For water they all have their own bottle they have to fill up at a setup water tank. The water tank is an important part because in Survivor there are certain areas people go to strategies in small groups: camp, water well and beach. We need to allow them to separate into little groups to plan and be sneaky.

**Tribal Council:** I think Tribal would need a full on set. Would look really cool and make it feel like official Survivor.

**Cameras**

Ideally a camera person per player. But each player carrying a GoPro works too. Main camera setup at the main areas: Tribal Council, main area of campsite, water tank area. Cameras will need to move for the challenges.

# Vibe

This may just be me but Sidemen gameshow type vids work best when they take the game somewhat seriously. Obviously still want the shenanigans (which Survivor game play will defo provide) but don't want it to be turned into a joke. Money stakes are fine but I think something like 'winner is guaranteed good team for next holiday vid' would be good to play for.

This post ended up being a lot longer than I thought. Let me know your lots thoughts and somehow get Sidemen to do this.",2,1734166360.0,miniminter,1,1.0,False

1hdynxs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hdynxs,Seoul 8 day solo trip November ,"After solo travelling earlier this year for the first time, I (28M) decided to take a solo trip to Seoul for 8 days - here’s what I did!


Day 1 Saturday: Arrived at ICN around 22:15, took out some won from an ATM (they seem to charge anywhere from 3000-5000+ fees from what I saw), bought a T Money card from a CU store for 4000 won, jumped on one of the last AREX all stop trains that night to Hongik, late snack from GS25 and checked into accommodation + sleep. It helped to research latest train times beforehand since if I spent too much time going through the airport, I may have missed the last train and would’ve needed to take a taxi or other transport. AREX is nice and cheap, around 4000 won to get to where I needed for only 1 hour and 10 mins or so.


Day 2 Sunday: Had an early start and walked to Gyeongui Line Forest Park. Had some French toast and a coffee at Yeontral Dabang which was owned by an old couple, super cute. Did some shopping in Hongdae as I had a list of things to get for friends and family from Olive Young - my god did I get a headache first time I walked into a store, soooo many products to choose from. Also found it amusing how staff greets a customer and then everyone else will follow up like a symphony. I had my passport on my at all times for tax free purchases - some places are instant refund and some you have to process at the airport.


Then instead of going to Myeongdong Market, I walked to Mangwon Market instead where it seemed mostly locals went. Got some seeded hotteok from a basement store near one of the entrances which was super busy, tried so-tteok too. All delicious. Then back to Hongdae for more shopping, watching street performances and I found a Korean fried chicken restaurant that caters to solo eaters as you can order half a portion. Chicken in the Kitchen - great spot came here twice. After some more street performance watching, went back to accommodation after picking up one of the viral chestnut tiramisus from the Netflix show and ate that (it was ok) before going to sleep.


Day 3 Monday: I was initially going to go to the War Memorial + National Museum but I didn’t realise the War Memorial was closed on Mondays, so saved this for another day. Spent a few hours at the National Museum where it was mostly Korean school kids on school trips. Interior was impressive and I needed another chill day after recovering from jet lag. After I walked to another cute cafe, Miss Lalla for a chocolate roll slice and coffee. It was a cute place and the cake was good but not amazing. The owner completed a French pastry Diploma and this was proudly presented in the main room which was cool to see.


Killed some time at the Starfield Mall buying gifts, Starfield Library was all Christmasfied with the lights but it was completely packed so I took a quick picture and left. Tried Korean McDonald’s and got a Supreme Shrimp burger and a bulbolgi burger, both yummy. The quality and price of fast food here was so much better than back home (UK). Explored Bongeunsa Temple at night for a peaceful walk before heading back to Hongdae for some KBBQ at a place that caters to solo eaters, Hongojib. Really recommend this place as it’s very affordable and the quality is great. I saw a lot of solo Koreans eat here too, not just tourists.


Day 4 Tuesday: Super early start for a 7am meet up to go on a DMZ tour (booked through Klook). Went to Majang Lake Bridge which was arguably better than the other options (another bridge and boat ride), Imjingak for the memorial village and then finally the observatory and then third tunnel. They warned us it would be a difficult trek down/up but I found the worst part was having to walk hunched over to get to the end of the tunnel as the ceiling got lower and lower, my back was killing me as a 6ft person, and this was way harder than the steep slope up imo. Overall most people in normal shape will be able to do this so don’t worry too much. Finished off the trip with a Korean buffet and browsed the gift shop - is the skin care/ginseng actually worth it here? I was a bit skeptical since the tour guides were really hyping it but maybe the stuff was just that good - let me know if you felt the same!


I was so tired after getting back (4:30pm) to Hongdae, went for a haircut at a foreigner friendly barber which was excellent, tried the chicken burgers at Moms Touch and picked up some CVS food on the way home. Also managed to find a really cute Cinnamonroll T Money key chain from the Cinnamonroll cafe store at AK plaza. Wasn’t cheap (18k) but it was worth it and now exists on my phone strap.


Day 5 Wednesday: All day Lotte world! I found discounted tickets on trip.com so jumped on the train and went to Lotte world, easy pick up using the qr code and in I went. At this time it was snowing a lot and I didn’t realise it was the heaviest snow Korea has seen for over 100 years!


I didn’t get the magic pass which was a mistake - a lot of the cool rollercoasters had such long lines (2-3 hours easily for French Revolution) but I managed to get on the conquistador after waiting 40 mins or so. I tried as many rides as I could, the fly venture ride was really cool and worth lining up for, sinbad ride was really busy earlier on so I waited until end of the day and didn’t have to queue up for long - this one had 2-3 unexpected short drops but otherwise was a laid back ride. There was a Pubg experience which was pretty neat - think time crisis in different rooms with 4d effects.


For an amusement park, the food and drink here was very reasonable - around £3-3.50 for each item whereas back home it would cost double/triple easily. How cool is that popcorn chicken and coke cup combo? Due to the snow, they closed the outdoor rides but it was still nice to take pictures of the famous lotte castle with the snow falling. After I went to Seoul Sky (pre booked tickets) almost before closing time and it was a good time to visit, hardly anyone there! Back to Hongdae for some dakgalbi which was min order 2 people (I finished 90% of it) and right outside the restaurant there was a old guy just solo dancing to some music in the snow - pretty sure I saw him dance to APT with someone on reddit before lol so probably same guy.


Day 5 Thursday: Pre booked a hanbok photoshoot at the Gyeongbokgung Palace, super cool experience and the pictures turned out great with the snowy backdrop. Despite the cold, I managed to walk to Bukchon Hanok Village and picked up a hot coffee on the way back at Cafe Lotus (also run by a cute elderly couple).

After getting changed, headed to Namusae Tea House for some bingsu (lol) and hot tea, this place was cosy and really pretty inside but just be warned the prices are quite expensive- my bingsu was 18k alone which would’ve been a KBBQ meal for one easily! There were mostly tourists here although I did see some Koreans. Still a nice way to keep out the cold for an hour or two.


Went to Gwangjang Market for some street food and man was it packed. Tbh I only got the twisted rice doughnut which was hot and crispy with a slight chew, and some dumplings from a store outside the market (Wang Mandu) which were delicious. Back to town for some more shopping and tried Lotteria - the ordering system was so cool - no interaction with staff needed, just order on the kiosk and when your order is ready, scan your receipt and pick up your order from a window you knock on. I got a hanwoo burger set that hit the spot.


Day 6 Friday: I was feeling a bit low energy at this point after doing 25-30k steps everyday so I got up really late and headed to the War Memorial. Before going, stopped off at a tonkatsu place for lunch near Samgakji Station (Tonkatsu Parwol).


Spent 3 hours learning about history, great museum and some parts about the Korean War made me emotional which usually never happens to me. Anyway to cheer myself up I went back to Hongdae for some Korean corn dogs and fried mandu! Back to the apt for a freshen up and headed out again on pre booked bar crawl. Spent the next 5 hours partying it up (still impressed by how hard Koreans can party) and then stumbling into a lamb skewer restaurant for some well needed food. I would recommend booking one of these bar crawls as I wouldn’t have explored the clubbing/nightlife otherwise. It was fun as a solo traveler/introvert!


Day 7 Saturday: Another late start to the day - tried a cafe called The Piehole in Sinchon. It was ok, I got a chocolate pecan pie slice and a cinnamon latte but I should’ve chosen a more popular pie. Hopped on the train to DDP and spent a few hours there. Some really cool exhibits at the DDP showroom, rotating camera video, infinity walk etc. Back to Hongdae (lol how many times have I said this) for some skin care shopping and more KBBQ, street busking watching and Korean fried chicken (same places as before).


Day 8 Sunday: Namdaemun Market although I only really saw one food stall which was a hotteok stall and had so many people lined up, so naturally I too joined. Was it worth the 30 minute wait? I think so as I hadn’t gotten to try a yachae hotteok yet and I needed something hot to start my hike. It was crispy and hot, but the noodles inside were a little soft. For the price, can’t beat it (3k). Bought 2, ate one on the way and saved the other for when I got to the top at N Seoul tower.


The hike to the top took around an hour and was a nice leg workout. Made the hotteok taste good even it was cold by that point. Spent some time taking in the views with a coffee but didn’t feel the need to go up into the tower. I did consider taking the cable car down but the price seemed extortionate and the actual amount of people in each car looked uncomfortable so I walked down. Found a 24 hour soup restaurant in Hongdae and got a bibimbap set with sundubu jjigae. The most vegetables I’ve eaten on my trip so far lol. It was very affordable (11k?) and tasty for my final meal.


Day 9 Monday: Doesn’t really count since I had to get up at 4am to catch my flight at 9am! But in retrospect I probably didn’t need to arrive at the airport so early, but wanted to just in case. Found a tax refund kiosk and inputted my details, after checking in luggage and going through to security, i found the office for tax refunds and managed to get some won back from the machine (as i will surely be back). Jumped on my long flight back home.

1hdyidd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hdyidd/self_serve_revenge_buffet/,Self serve revenge buffet,"I don't know that this is the most appropriate category, but I have a big ole' kettle of tea I've kept on the back burner for ten years that no one but my husband knows about, and have been looking for an anonymous outlet for years. It's not really petty revenge, but it is chaotic, has a sweet revengy smell, and has a happy ending.
When I (31F) was 19 I got married to a man, we'll call him Daniel, we'd been dating since we were 13. He is an idiot, I knew it even when I was a teenager, but little did I know, I was also an idiot. Thankfully, idiot washes off with education and effort, neither of which he was interested in bathing in.
Anyway, we get married at 19 because my mother is religious, and gave me shit for living with him unwed, even though the alternative was not being able to afford housing close to my college, while simultaneously pushing me to go to college. So mom if you see this, it's kind of your fault. I probably would have married him anyway, because I was naive and believed, I suppose, that I could not do better, plus my juvenile understanding of loyalty was staying with someone regardless of whatever they put you through. By the time we got married I was already under the impression that he would never match me in wit or intelligence, and most of the time when he talked to people in public I would feel shame because he was so so stupid. But what I didn't know, because we'd been each others first, and I assumed each other's last, that he was a nightmare of a freak.
Not long after we got married, Daniel started requesting weird things in the sack. Of course, being a wife I assumed well, we'll each have kinks the other will like and that we should oblige each other. These started out pretty standard, weird positions, requests for use of the back door, things maybe I didn't want to do, but hey, I knew enough to know that they weren't unheard of things. In my naivety, I probably also thought that these would be temporary or blue moon events. They were not. Normal things no longer sufficed, and eventually the weird things didn't suffice either. To be brief, find the weirdest things on the hub, and imagine being asked to try them with your husband. Of course, having used the foot-in-the-door method of a car salesman, he slowly wormed his way through requesting everything you can think of, the lightest of which was bondage.
I am ashamed to say that I did try to cater to some of these things just to keep up, but most of them I found abhorrent and did not entertain. He kept going until he landed on swinging, and by this point (it escalated quickly, over the course of 2 years) it was unsurprising that he brought it up, just because he'd already brought up every loathsome thing he could find, of course he would want to do this. I would entertain this only in bedroom talk, but in clear conversation, I was steadfast that I didn't want to actually do that. I took pride in the fact that we'd not been with any one else, only each other. Also, for obvious reasons I had no desire to introduce what would definitely hurt my feelings. There are people who do this that get past the jealousy and feel confident enough in their SOs loyalty to them to do this, not only had I no confidence in his loyalty emotionally if someone else was catering to his gross fantasies, I am also an unapologetic jealous witch and have no interest in changing that, thank you.
In case you're wondering if he just wanted to do this to sleep around, of course he wanted that, but the primary part of his fantasies was watching me perform with someone else. 
Yes, a cuck. 
So Daniel understood that I was not interested in taking this fantasy of his into reality, but lo and behold, one day he picks me up from school and says there is a man waiting for us in OUR BEDROOM AT HOME. I am of course, not up for this. But being thrust into this situation, in my defense, 1.) I am young and dumb, 2.) I have let him weasel me into bedroom things I am already not happy with or proud of and easily pushed to the next step, 3.) I am approximately 5 minutes from home and not in the drivers seat, and 4.) I was not a confident confrontationalist, I did not stand up for myself often and was easily cowed. We get home, things happen to me, yes I can walk away but I have rationalized in that 5 minutes that this will be the culmination of his problematic deviance. This will be the thing that we talk about when we are 50 and talk about being wild and young, and doing dirty things way back when. He made it seem like a one off crazy thing we would try and if i didn't like it, we wouldn't do it again.
To be brief, I have acknowledged that I was stupid, but I cannot account for how naive I was at 21, to think that I had no say in my life and that everything would be okay if I just took the punches instead of getting the hell out of the way of punches. After that day, I really felt broken, but I had no one to express this to. I was so ashamed and was never going to tell a soul, so I couldn't seek help anywhere. But my relationship felt broken and open, like anything was now free game and I'd torn open the black hole of whatever deviant was living under Daniel's skin. Things never calmed down after that. I had to sleep on the couch because I would wake up with him doing things to me if I was in the bed, things I said no to when I was awake. At this time I found out I was pregnant, time-wise there was no way it was anyones but my husbands, so we can put to bed that it was the one-off guy's baby. 
But he wanted to do things with other women, and wanted me to continue to do things with other men, too. Even though we were about to start a family. At this point, I felt so broken I stopped saying no, because the line had been crossed, so who gave a shit what happened on the other side of it. I still hoped he would say let's stop and be normal people and parents by the end of my pregnancy. He saw women, and asked me to see other men. So at work, I saw a handsome guy, let's call him Gerard, on the other side of the bar who was flirting with myself and the other baristas every time he came in. He came in late one evening when it was just me, and we got to talking, and I told him what was up, the jist that said I was married and pregnant, but available. Gerard (who checked in a clinic for STDs before anyone asks) invited me over to his house and we did the thing. He seemed disinterested and unattached, which was fine, since that's all this was, and I knew I'd probably never see him again.
Of course, Daniel wants to make this a lifestyle now, but in a rare instance of putting my foot down, I say I'm not willing to expose myself to randos while pregnant. He says okay, sleep with someone you've already slept with. Guy one was an experience I did not want to relive, so I call up Gerard. Do you want to be buddies? Hell yes, he did. So I spend a lot of time going to Gerard's house. Over time, we do the deed and watch movies. Then we just watch movies, then we go kayaking, and hiking, and walking our dogs. But the time is getting closer to have the baby and I don't want to do this anymore. I want to be a family unit with my husband, and tell Gerard it's time to split, I'm going to go be a normal family. We like each other very much by this point, but knew where it would end. So we are saying a sad goodbye, and I will never forget him standing in my headlights as I backed out of his driveway. We text occasionally, because it's a bit like a breakup by that point, but I am firm that I'm going to make this work. Daniel also reigns it in and we come back to normalcy, even though it was not, it was a nice pretend normalcy. The fake it til you make it kind.
Now, the baby is on the way, but something is terribly wrong with it (not gendering for plausible deniability, the only person who would be able to confirm this story is Daniel, anyway, but this story is definitely singular to us). The baby comes and they have a disease, the life shortening kind that requires caregivers and nurses more than parents, and they are diagnosed at birth. 
Skipping forward a couple weeks, we get home, I am in full PPD and PTSD mode, we've just been told our child has a 10 year life expectancy, I am distraught. Daniel doesn't even take time to breathe, he wants to continue our previous arrangement. As I said before, he is stupid, and I don't think he ever grasped at the time that our child was never expected to walk or talk, or even survive. He was talking about taking them out on a boat or fishing when they are older, and 10 other shades of dumb ass shit they could never do. It's like he believed he was just going to be a little delayed, but this disease is life shortening, and now I've learned that the average is 10 because many pass at ages like 2 and 4 and others pass at like, 20. So 10 is a guesstimate.
Anyway, in this aspect, I am not stupid, I understand the implications and am rightfully destroyed. He wants to see other women? Fine, I don't care. Good reason to see Gerard.
I contact Gerard and we meet at a lake front, where I cry my eyes out about my child and so does he.
You can probably see where this is going, but over the course of the next few times we see each other, Gerard and I realize that we don't ever want to be sepersted again. I decided that my life was thoroughly in the garbage can, and the absolute least I could do to improve it was leave the filthy relationship I was in in the dust. Daniel was completely blindsided when I told him to move out. I paid for the house and told him to get out, but I couldn't afford to keep it without help, so Gerard moved in 3 months later. To the world, I knew this looked like I had an affair, and I never bothered to set the record straight, because I was more ashamed of the truth, that I was complicit in the destruction of my marriage with the permission of my now ex.
I would typically say never leave your baby with your boyfriend, but Gerard was vanilla in every way, and everything about him was safer and more secure than my ex. So after another 3 months, I let him watch the baby while I was at work. 3 months after that, it was family pictures with him included. I'd literally been with him since my first trimester, it never felt like he wasn't his father. But I didn't encourage that in case something fell through, but by 18 months old, we called him dad. Even my religious mother who was appalled to learn the bits I told her, and absolutely hated Gerard when he moved in, acknowledged him as dad. Everyone could see that Gerard didn't care about my child's disability or the circumstances that he came to be in our lives. He just loved me, and loved my child just as much.
My child is now about to be the dreaded 10 years old. Gerard and I, and our other very young children, are extremely happy living far away from where any of this happened. My child's teacher only recently found out that he is not the biological father, because Gerard has never treated them like anything but his child, even though they are completely disabled, and their own biological father has openly said he wants nothing to do with them, and has tried to sign away his rights in order to not pay child support. (Thank God I left him, what an awful life they would have lead with that man in the house.)
It took years to get past the PTSD, Gerard was patient and parented when I didn't have the strength. He does diaper changes, tube feeds, appointments, you name it. Things I see other mothers fighting to get their husbands to do with their healthy biological children, he has done from day one, and a million times more. 

Daniel went on to have a happy divorce, pillaging his way into knocking a girl up and marrying her. I'm told by his family, who still love and check in on my child, that he is a shit father and step-father to 2 poor hapless children whose mother has the poor taste I grew out of.

It's definitely the long game, and a long read, sorry about that. But some nights, after the kids are all in bed, I remember what brought me to where I am, the nightmare I endured and the amazing man that went into a coffee shop on a Friday in January hoping to get laid by flirting with the batista and found himself in a big fat mess with a happy outcome.",3,1734164872.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

90% of the time I love him. 10% of the time I want to take my dog and become a wild woman of the forest.

He always brings me coffee in the morning, will go to the shops for me, bring me snacks in the afternoon, collects me from the station. He really makes me laugh like no one else can. He is supportive of my career and anything else I want to do - even things I am clearly not good at like when I took up painting.

He is also the untidiest person I have ever met. He never puts a new bin liner in the bin when he takes the bins out. He fills the sink to wash the dishes and then leaves the sink full of dirty dishwater all day. He puts everything on the top shelf (including the stepladder I use to get things off the top shelf). He is constantly leaving fast food wrappers in my car. Once we fell asleep in the sun and it made him feel ill. So he got up and left me there to also sleep in the sun and didn’t close the curtains therefore allowing me to get heatstroke.

We’ve no kids. He is not currently working. I will always be the breadwinner if we’re honest and he’s supportive of that. I think the no kids this is by choice but also how can you have kids with a man who doesn’t always flush the toilet?
