Imagine trekking through its surreal vistas, gazing at towering peaks, and experiencing nature in its rawest form, all while managing to stay within a budget. Here's how I made it happen, and how you can too!

### üìç Planning: The Key to Affordable Adventure
Before setting foot in Patagonia, meticulous planning becomes your best friend. Choose to travel during the shoulder seasons (October-November or March-April) when the crowds thin out, prices drop, and the weather is still hospitable. Embrace flexibility by booking hostels in advance and keeping an eye on flight deals. Websites and apps like Skyscanner and Google Flights can be lifesavers!

### üöê Getting Around: Embrace the Backroads
Public transportation is affordable and offers a chance to mingle with locals. In larger towns, such as Puerto Natales or El Calafate, buses are your gateway to iconic trails. For those venturing deeper, carpool with fellow travelers or consider renting a campervan. Remember, a friendly smile and a few Spanish phrases can open doors to shared rides and unforgettable stories.

### üèïÔ∏è Accommodation: Comfort Meets Conservation
While luxury lodges are tempting, Patagonia boasts a network of budget-friendly accommodations. From charming hostels like ""Hostelworld"" to eco-friendly campsites, there's something for everyone. Don‚Äôt miss out on 'Refugios' in Torres del Paine‚Äîrustic huts offering a warm bed amidst nature‚Äôs grandeur.

### üç≤ Eating Well Without the Splurge
Patagonian cuisine is a treat, with hearty stews and fresh seafood. To keep costs down, shop at local markets and prepare meals whenever possible. Invest in a thermal flask for coffee stops or a homemade lunch during hikes. Treat yourself sparingly to dining out, and when you do, opt for local eateries to savor authentic flavors without the hefty price tag.

### ü•æ Hiking: The Essence of Patagonia
The most enriching experiences here are free! Trails like the W Trek in Torres del Paine or the Monte Fitz Roy hike in El Chalt√©n are highlights that cost nothing but effort and endurance. Equip yourself with a good pair of hiking boots, layers of clothing, and plenty of water.

### üåü Final Thoughts: Connect and Reflect
Traveling Patagonia on a budget is about embracing simplicity and connecting with the environment around you. Listen to locals, respect the landscape, and immerse fully in the adventure that unfolds. There‚Äôs a profound joy in discovering that world-class experiences don‚Äôt demand a world-class budget.

Our apartment gets messy so fast. I used to be a really clean person. Growing up I never had a messy room but when I moved in with my mom in high school I developed really bad depression and anxiety. After that I never could keep anything clean. 

We both have pets so pet hair is everywhere. No matter what our vacuum doesn‚Äôt pick it up and I can‚Äôt lint roll the entire apartment unfortunately. Our counters are constantly full of trash or dishes or really anything. We both also have adhd so we set something down  and forget it exists which makes it harder to put things away.

Our living room floor is usually clean because our pets stay out there but the coffee table is awful. My fianc√© has a bad habit of leaving dishes or trash on the counters or where he sat down to eat and I have no energy after my full time job. Our bedroom is a whole other issue. I have to keep three different sizes of my clothes because my weight fluctuates so I have too many clothes to keep neat. They all end up on the floor because a basket falls over or I can‚Äôt find something and am rushing to get out the door or because I said I was going to organize them put them piles then got too busy to finish.

I wash dishes at work all day so I hate doing them at home so they pile up. I have no energy to get out bed and the only reason I do is for my pets. They‚Äôre the one thing that keeps me sane. My fianc√©‚Äôs cats are also out of control so that doesn‚Äôt help the depression. They destroy everything. And make the mess so much worse. 

I tried having an app with reminders on my phone but it didn‚Äôt help. I also tried having a list on every door in the apartment but the cats got them down and ate them all I have one left now I think. I wanted to get rid of a bunch of our stuff to minimize the mess because I feel like if we had less stuff it would be easier to keep clean but my fianc√© doesn‚Äôt want to let go of anything and I can‚Äôt force him to do that. and going through all of my stuff is a huge task to accomplish. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. If I was on my medication still it wld be a different story but I can‚Äôt afford that so I‚Äôm stuck trying to figure something else out.",1,1742487254.0,Apartmentliving,0,1.0,False
1jfsl23,https://www.reddit.com/r/thoracicoutletsupport/comments/1jfsl23/being_tossed_around_between_diagnosis/,Being tossed around between diagnosis,"So a while ago I went to the doc and explained my symptoms of raising my left arm and my vision going black and getting dizzy, fainting, the pain from the back of my arm to my fingers and the numbness and tingling and extreme cold. No discoloration. Went to cardiologist for POTS. Nope. I went for a TOS test with PPG and it showed flatline when I raise my arm, so no blood flow to my fingers. Went for a CT scan, no compression shown. Vascular surgery cancelled my appointment. Went for an EMG which was normal. Went for an ultrasound Doppler thing with duplex and it showed high PSV in my proximal subclavian artery and low PSV in my distal radial artery. Went back to the doc and was sent to Ortho to check for brachial plexopathy and Vascular to check for subclavian steal syndrome. Ortho did X-rays this morning and saw I have cervical something where my neck is completely straight. It only bothers me when I look up for extended periods of time but no other neck issues. He ordered an MRI that I have next week because he said I had a positive elbow flexion test and positive adsons test and everything aligns with TOS and usually it‚Äôs physical therapy but my other symptoms are not aligning so they want imaging of the whole thing. The vascular doc I was scheduled with for Monday was then changed to another doc that specializes in venous after the MRI because the doc I was scheduled with specialized in arterial like TOS and she‚Äôs not seeing TOS. Gabapentin does nothing so we ruled out nerves. The low PSV and positive adsons test, according to my doc, points to an issue with my radial artery but everyone is tossing me around and one doc says TOS but the other says no and I just can‚Äôt get a diagnosis of anything but it‚Äôs getting worse. I dropped my coffee cup the other morning because my arm and hand went completely numb and that‚Äôs never happened. The pain is also getting worse no matter what position I‚Äôm in.

The weight of Hannah‚Äôs words stayed with me for days.

""Mark and I‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not okay.""

I told myself it wasn‚Äôt my problem. That their marriage was their business. But the truth was, I was part of it, whether I wanted to be or not.

I wasn‚Äôt just a man returning from the dead‚ÄîI was a ghost haunting their lives.

Mark‚Äôs Desperation

A week later, Mark showed up at my apartment. Unannounced. He looked exhausted, dark circles under his eyes.

‚ÄúWe need to talk,‚Äù he said.

I let him in, unsure of what to expect. He sat down on my couch, rubbing his hands together like he was trying to find the right words.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do anymore,‚Äù he admitted.

I leaned against the counter. ‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù

Mark let out a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúAbout everything. About Ethan. About Hannah. About you.‚Äù

I stayed silent, letting him talk.

‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt look at me the same way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEver since you came back, it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, like she‚Äôs questioning everything.‚Äù

I exhaled. ‚ÄúMark‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI love her,‚Äù he interrupted. ‚ÄúI love Ethan. I love the life we built. But I can feel it slipping, and I don‚Äôt know how to stop it.‚Äù

For the first time, I saw Mark for what he really was‚Äînot my replacement. Not my enemy.

Just a man trying not to lose the people he loved.

The Hardest Question

Then he asked me something I wasn‚Äôt prepared for.

‚ÄúDo you still love her?‚Äù

The room felt like it shrank around me.

I opened my mouth, but no words came out.

Mark scoffed. ‚ÄúYeah. That‚Äôs what I thought.‚Äù

I finally found my voice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that simple.‚Äù

Mark shook his head. ‚ÄúIt is that simple, James. If you love her, she‚Äôll choose you. And if she chooses you, I lose everything.‚Äù

His voice cracked on the last word.

I had no answer.

Because I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted anymore.

Hannah‚Äôs Choice

A few days later, Hannah called me.

‚ÄúCome over,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù

My heart pounded the entire drive. When I got there, she was sitting on the porch, her hands wrapped around a mug of coffee.

I sat next to her.

She stared down at her cup. ‚ÄúMark told me he talked to you.‚Äù

I nodded.

She took a shaky breath. ‚ÄúI need to be honest with you, James.‚Äù

I braced myself.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret my life with Mark,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret the years we spent together. But I do regret that I never got to choose. Because if I had known you were alive, things might have been different.‚Äù

My chest tightened. ‚ÄúHannah‚Ä¶‚Äù

She turned to me, tears in her eyes. ‚ÄúI still love you. But I love Mark too. And I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù

I looked at her‚Äîthe woman I had dreamed about for years. The mother of my child. The person who had been my future.

And I realized something.

I didn‚Äôt want to win.

I just wanted her to be happy.

Even if that meant letting go.

1jfsidf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dream/comments/1jfsidf/my_most_intricate_dream/,My Most Intricate Dream,"Probably my most intricate dream yet

Probably my most intricate dream yet, ima try to be as detailed as can be from remembering. Basically from what i can remember it starts off with me at the hilton working in the coffee shop and i have NEVER ever had a dream of me there. It starts out in a scenario where I‚Äôm talking to this very eccentric individual. With VERY odd features to say the least, he looked almost like an exact human version of Winnie the pooh only not as chubby, he was relatively slim to be honest as well as tall and was the same color as pooh. He was insanely charismatic, witty, comedic and talkative. He worked there apparently as well he didnt stand out though in terms of his looks it was as though his appearance was very normalized amongst everyone but even though we were casually chatting as if none of how his appearance was weird i felt this odd sense in my mind consciously thinking something about this is off. As in His persona and appearance alone doesnt seem so normal but everyone treated it as  though it was and didnt give it a second thought. It was like i semi had the thought i was in a dream but it felt so real as well as i was so distracted by this insanely interesting character that i couldn‚Äôt stay on the thought that i was in a dream for two long. 

Now we shift to me in the actual coffee shop, im making drinks and so happen i have to make drinks for him. And i want to iterate for context im using the pronouns he/him but yet im honestly not sure if he was male or female thinking of if now bc yes his presence came of more like a guy , they could have just as much been a girl as well as in the story or movies winnie is a female but for the longest time. I just fact checked that winnie is actually a boy but the real life bear was based on a girl bear whch is actually crazy bc i never knew that but somehow just found that out after talking of what i am now. But anyway also he was wearing a all black suit with a black top hat maybe i know for sure he had a hat that was black. Looking back also im not sure if he was a co worker i didnt see a name tag but still couldve been bc i myself sometimes dont wear mine. So im making his drinks i dont remember exactly what but it could have been a earl grey or english breakfast hot tea. Were talking at the end of the bar, with one other person to the right of me behind the bar, i said some playful smart remark to him and he followed up with some hilarious gesture seemingly mocking me recalling some embarrassing experience we both shared. The memory was something i vividly recalled as it involved the previous interaction we had in the dream. 

Then all i can remember after that moment is ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù supposedly leaving the dream and started constantly thinking about it trying to interpreted everything happening bc it definitely stood out in comparison to many dreams ive had. Trying to recall if ive ever brought him up to anyone before but to do so i had to minimally remember his name. So Even while in my ‚Äúwaking state‚Äù i continued to think that ive know him in real life bc of how familiar the strange looking character was. I kept try to minimally remember his name as though i truly remembered knowing them in real life, the only letter i felt as though i could conjure up to familiarize him more was ‚ÄúL‚Äù i kelt hearing the name like lillith(leel-lith) and lillit(lee-lit) but wasnt for sure but thats what i narrowed it down too. I never seen the character as a scary or ominous presence and I go to say that bc as im laying down i hear i faint voice which game me chills saying ‚Äúcome over‚Äù and instantly got the visualization of him in my dining room gesturing to come i didnt really know what to think of it but my initial thought was kind of creepy, Enough to give me goosebumps but not anything so crazy to truly terrify me. I honestly dont think the guy or lady was ominous or malicious but definitely had immense welcoming energy that could feel overwhelming.

Now were shifted to being out with my cousin and his friends, i believe were out party not to memorable to go on as far as that but i do remember us going to the hotel room. Im assuming his friends were visiting , it sounded like he was saying the next day he was having a baby shower which stood out as odd because he for sure wasn‚Äôt having babies anytime soon in my waking life so i immediately knew i was in a dream but instead of taking control of it i just let it play out to see how it would play out.(I lucid dream more often than not but i sometimes like to see how it plays out) My nose ended up bleeding slightly nothing overly dramatic i might have just itched it to hard or something, shortly after i was heading to leave. Before i headed to far away from the room after going i got the thought to go back in to wash my hands from touching my nose do i go into the bathroom and immediately looked at myself in the mirror. Up to this point ever never EVER seen how i looked in a mirror inside of a dream i thought it wasn‚Äôt possible as in it just wasn‚Äôt an event that happens in dreams. But when i seen myself at this point i was just so shocked i could see myself , my hair was like an orange peach color in braid from maybe like 3 inches longer than my hair in my waking life, Then at that moment the dream ended and i finally woke up for the first time in the exact position of my second dream shift only i knew i was really up bc the sensation before felt more dream like but i didn‚Äôt put it together until my 3rd dream, but who knows if I‚Äôm actually in my waking life now and not just waiting for that next dream shift‚Ä¶

I dont know if you've heard of OpenCoffee before or if its a dead idea but its something I was a big fan of.

  
If you look at the problems agencies AND prospect have - its ""who to trust"" - this spans multiple industries/problems and one outcome is the Open Coffee Idea

this is one of those crazy ideas that doesnt make linear sense that had a bunch of great outcomes without trying to tie them to goals (unlike a BNI for example) - an un-conference, an un-planned social+business support network that, by nature and not by design, results in great business outcomes.

I ran my agency in a tiny City in Ireland where we had almost no business and no interest in any but go most of our business from Dublin, London and the USA. The point of having a local market meetup was to allow entrepreneurs, business owners, mom+pop shops, consultants to pair up with local world class thinking and elevate everyone's ideation and development.

The idea is that founders & owners are self motivated, know how to sell and enjoy relaxing in business settings vs just grabbing a beer/coffee with buds. You invite people to join, not to sell, and every 3rd/4th meetup you introduce a local tech startup or groundbreaking visionary (local or visiting)

Problems it solves

1. Meeting with real people in a globalized world

2. Creating trust

3. Mirroring relationships as online backlinks (for social and SEO)

4. Idea sharing

5. Mental/life or work-life balance and support

  
Outcomes we found over a 10 year period

* Networking from a wide circle with trust built in vs direct sales
* Herlping brick's n mortar convert to digital success

Why digital agencies are the hub at the wheel of open coffee

* Everyone is a local client
* Scale Authority in link building
* Wider networking + exposure
* Trust and support
* Geo-graphic protection vs limited online deep web
* Sell ideas and pay it forward",1,1742487018.0,agency,0,1.0,False

# First Day on 10mg

I was already anxious the day before because I tend to overthink taking new medication. When I took my first 10mg dose, within 5-10 minutes, I started shaking and feeling even more anxious. Eventually, I calmed myself down, but I was waiting for *something* to happen.

After 30 minutes, when it was supposed to kick in, nothing major changed. I kept asking myself, *Is this working?* I wasn‚Äôt suddenly focused or productive. The only weird thing was that I became hyper-aware of physical sensations‚Äîlike feeling every single drop of water on my skin in the shower or the texture of my toothbrush on each tooth. But I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was real or just me overanalyzing things.

Later, I made the mistake of drinking coffee before heading to work. Bad idea. I felt *so* anxious on my commute, and once I got to the office, I was just as distracted as usual. If anything, I was more agitated and sensitive. I still had the urge to check my phone constantly, switch tasks, or procrastinate just like I would without meds.

**The one great thing?** I *slept* like a baby that night‚Äîdespite the coffee. That was magical.

# The Next Few Days: Still Meh

Day 2 was just‚Ä¶ mediocre. No real changes in focus. I avoided coffee, which helped with the anxiety, but my productivity was the same. The one small difference was that I felt less afraid of making mistakes at work. Normally, I hesitate a lot because I fear rejection or messing things up, but that fear wasn‚Äôt as strong. Still, I got tired quickly, and my overall focus didn‚Äôt improve.

By Day 5, I reached out to my psychiatrist and said, *Hey, this isn‚Äôt really working.* She suggested increasing my dose to 20mg, but I asked to try 15mg first.

# 15mg vs. 20mg vs. 30mg

15mg was fine‚Äînot life-changing, but tolerable. Then I tried 20mg. **Hated it.** I felt more anxious and on edge, and my sleep wasn‚Äôt as good anymore. I‚Äôve taken 20mg twice now, and both times, it made me uncomfortable. Now I‚Äôm out of Ritalin and haven‚Äôt seen my psychiatrist yet, but I‚Äôm not sure if I even want to continue.

# My Concerns & Questions

* 20mg already feels like too much, but from what I understand, 30mg is the max dose for Ritalin. I don‚Äôt see the point in increasing if it just makes me more anxious.
* If it‚Äôs not helping my focus, should I even keep taking it?
* I‚Äôm also worried my psychiatrist will say I don‚Äôt actually have ADHD, even though I was diagnosed as a kid.
* My psychiatrist initially suggested taking an SSRI along with Ritalin, but I wanted to try Ritalin alone first. Now I‚Äôm realizing my anxiety might be a completely separate issue from my ADHD. Maybe I need therapy to help with that instead?

I feel stuck. I don‚Äôt want to waste money on more appointments if Ritalin just isn‚Äôt for me. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Any advice?",0,1742486828.0,adhdwomen,1,0.5,False

After checking everything they concluded bad luck all around. 

Surgery went smoothly and rehab too. Broke in three pieces put a plate on it and a pin from the hip bone al the way down. But still it is a weak spot and they said it will take around a year to recover from the surgery as if it never happened. 

He is no longer aloud to retrieve balls- inside the house because the slippery floor and sudden movements make him limp a little. 
 Retrieving outside basically the same but without the slippery floor so it‚Äôs a little less but he is young, dumb and really explosive. We walk 10km a day and he won‚Äôt limp from these normal running/walking sessions.

Now comes the thing, he likes to crawl under a low coffee table and crawls with his legs behind him like young pups often chill. He does this 15 times per evening. Are these movements bad for his recovery or hips in general.  They are x-rayed and hips are perfectly healthy.

Beside fatigue and sleepiness, i feel constantly cold, i'm wearing a jacket and socks all the time even though i live in a hot region, this has been also going for a decade but it is gotten worse recently where I have some hours of feeling extremely shivery and cold (usually accompanied by tiredness and sleepiness), i don't just feel cold on my legs and hands but also in my arms and face and in my body as a whole

I have been hearing this drumming noise in my ear whenever i'm tired, i have unusually low appetite also for the past two years, depression and lack of interest, foggy brain, sometimes fast heartbeat and short breath, and basically feeling as if i'm sleeping most of the time

I did a full test recently, thyroid and vitamin b is normal, vitamin D is 70 nmol/l, hemoglobin is 11.1 g/d but my ferritin is low (7 pmol)¬†

I'v been taking Iron pills daily for exactly two weeks now (200 mg) along with vitamin C while avoiding drinking coffee, tea, and milk two hours after and before

I still feel tired, today I slept for 12 hours and stayed extremely sleepy, exhausted and cold for the whole day, I managed to sleep for one hour, tried to walk and move but i felt more sleepy so for the rest of the day i've been in bed.

I know two weeks isn't enough to see a result but i'm starting to doubt that this is the cause since I don't have anemia and I don't see people talking about some of my symptoms for Iron deficiency, like feeling extreme cold or sleeping too much

Just want to know if this is common or should I look up other causes, and also when did you notice any improvement in your fatigue and energy level.

**Diet**

- Completely removed cheese, milk, sour cream etc. Used to drink milk+sugar with my coffee every day and was a huge cheese lover, we'd go through a brick of cheese every week

- No added sugar, white breads at all

- Reduce pasta intake

- No bacon or other noticeably fatty meats, reduced red meat intake in general (steaks, lamb) but did not completely cut it out

- Oatmeal for breakfast everyday with psyllium husk/chia seeds/hemp hearts. Previously, I usually skipped breakfast as coffee+milk+sugar kept me full until lunch

- More salmon and chicken in my diet

- Reduced eggs and shrimp (probably wasn't needed)

- Don't think I ever hit 40g of soluble fiber per day but pretty close to it most of the time. 
- Tried to stay under 10g of sat fat per day but wasn't tracking it super close. 


**Exercise**

- Added 30 Minutes of weight lifting 4 times a week +  my usual occasional walks and hikes

- No cardio

**Supplements**

- Kyolic Aged Garlic Extract with Soy Lechtinin twice per day
- Psyllium husk capsules after every meal
- Pure EPA Omega3 Oil tablets once per day

1jfs2hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkNarrations/comments/1jfs2hl/my_childhood_bully_sent_me_a_letter_asking_for/,My childhood bully sent me a letter asking for forgiveness after 15 years.,"I (32F) never thought I'd be typing this out, but yesterday I received a letter that's completely thrown me. For context, when I was in secondary school (about Year 9 to Year 13 for those not in the UK), I was relentlessly bullied by this one girl, I will call her Sarah.

Sarah made my teen years absolute hell. It started with little things, snide comments about my clothes, my hair, my accent (I had moved from northern England to a town near London and apparently that was hilarious to her). But it escalated quickly. She would ""accidentally"" knock my books off my desk, she'd whisper horrible things when teachers weren't looking, she'd spread rumours about me sleeping around (I hadn't even had my first kiss yet). She once poured juice all over my coursework the day before it was due. I had to stay up all night redoing it and still got a rubbish mark.

The worst part was the isolation. Sarah was popular, and she made sure everyone knew that being friends with me was social suicide. I'd walk into the canteen and watch tables of girls suddenly go quiet and then burst into laughter after I'd passed. I had a couple of friends who stuck by me, but even they would sometimes disappear when Sarah was around because they were scared of becoming targets too.

I tried telling teachers, but Sarah was clever. She was a model student when adults were watching - always volunteering for things, getting good marks, being super helpful. When I complained, it was always my word against hers, and most teachers clearly thought I was just being oversensitive or making it up for attention.

I remember one parents evening whee my english teacher told my mum I needed to ""focus more"" because my grades were slipping. I couldn't exactly explain that I couldn't focus because I was spending the entire lesson worrying about what Sarah would do next.

The whole thing completely destroyed my confidence. I stopped putting my hand up in class even when I knew the answer. I started having panic attacks before school. My grades tanked, and I ended up with much worse A-levels than I should have. I was predicted all As and Bs and ended up with mostly Cs. It effected my uni choices and honestly, probably my entire career path.

Fast forward to now. I'm 32, I've built a decent life for myself. I still struggle with anxiety and confidence issues in social situations and I'm not putting that all down to the bullying but I've had therapy, I've got good friends, a job I mostly enjoy. I thought I'd moved on from all of that teen drama as best I could.

Then yesterday, I get home from work to find a letter with handwriting I didn't recognize. I open it, and... it's from Sarah. I literally felt sick to my stomach seeing her name. Just sick.

The gist of the letter is that she's been in therapy for the past year, and her therapist suggested she make amends for past behaviour that she regrets. She wrote that she's been ""haunted"" by how she treated me and others in school. She apologized for everything (mentioning several specific incidents I'd actually forgotten about) and said she understands if I hate her forever, but that she hopes I can find it in myself to forgive her because she ""can't move forward"" without my forgiveness. She even suggested we could meet for coffee to ""talk things through properly.""

What's really weird is how she got my addres. I've moved several times since school, I'm not on social media much, and we have zero mutual friends as far as I know. She said something vague about ""asking around"" which frankly creeps me out a bit.

Here's the thing, I don't think I can forgive her. Maybe that makes me a terrible person, but every time I think about what she put me through, I just feel angry. The idea of meeting her face to face makes me feel physically ill. At the same time, a tiny part of me is curious about why she did what she did, and I wonder if talking to her might give me some kind of closure, maybe I could question her, maybe telling her how it made me feel would make me feel better but then is doing that selfish in itself?!

But honestly, I think this letter is more about making HER feel better than it is about me. Why should I have to dredge up all that pain just so she can tick a box in her therapy homework and ""move forward""? I've spent years trying to move past all of this, and now she's thrown it all back in my face again. Not that it ever goes  away as some of you may know but having it just come out of nowhere like this is just shit.

I'm completeky conflicted. Part of me wants to write back telling her exactly what her bullying did to me possibly meet to tell her in person, in excruciating detail. Another part wants to just ignore it and pretend it never arrived. And a tiny, tiny part wonders if meeting her might actually help me somehow, though I can't imagine how.

What would you do in my situation? Am I a horrible person for not wanting to forgive her? Should I meet her? Should I write back? Or should I just throw the letter away and carry on with my life?",8,1742485936.0,MarkNarrations,3,1.0,False
1jfs2gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/InkandIron/comments/1jfs2gk/a_day_without_duty/,A Day Without Duty,"For the first time in what felt like years, Mathias Moreau had nothing scheduled. No negotiations. No emergency meetings. No last-minute crises to avert. It was, by some miraculous bureaucratic accident, a free day.

He leaned back in his chair aboard the TSS Aegis, nursing a cup of coffee that had long since gone cold, staring at his personal terminal where a calendar mercifully displayed no upcoming events. The sheer novelty of it left him uncertain what to do with himself.

A soft shimmer in the air signaled Eliara‚Äôs arrival‚Äîher avatar coalescing into its usual form, humanoid but subtly unreal, woven from strands of shifting light. She stood at the edge of his desk, watching him with quiet curiosity.

‚ÄúYou seem‚Ä¶ lost,‚Äù she observed.

Moreau exhaled, running a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúI think I forgot what leisure looks like.‚Äù

Eliara‚Äôs lips quirked up into a smirk, her voice showing hints of amusement. ‚ÄúA tragedy of cosmic proportions.‚Äù

He shot her a look. ‚ÄúCareful, I might start asking you for recommendations.‚Äù

She tilted her head, waiting.

Moreau hesitated, then leaned forward, resting his arms on the desk as his own smile cracked his lips. ‚ÄúActually‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not a bad idea.‚Äù

Eliara blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He gestured vaguely. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have anything scheduled. No crises, no diplomacy, no warlords needing a firm hand. So I‚Äôm asking you‚Äîwhat do you want to do?‚Äù

For the first time since he had known her, Eliara froze.

It wasn‚Äôt hesitation in the way an AI processed vast amounts of data. No, this was something more human‚Äîgenuine surprise. Her luminous form flickered briefly, as though she hadn‚Äôt fully understood the question.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Ä¶ want?‚Äù

Moreau nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. You. Not what the mission requires. Not what I need. You. If you could spend a day doing anything, what would it be?‚Äù

Eliara didn‚Äôt speak immediately.

He had never asked her that before.

She had been created to serve, to assist, to facilitate. Every conversation, every decision she made, was guided by purpose‚Äîhis purpose, humanity‚Äôs purpose. Never once had anyone asked what she wanted. The question was so simple, so human, that it almost did not compute.

Moreau watched her, letting the silence stretch between them. He wasn‚Äôt impatient. He was waiting, genuinely curious.

Finally, softly, Eliara spoke.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a place,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúA world.‚Äù

Moreau raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù

She stepped forward, her form shifting slightly as if drawing from a deeper well of thought. ‚ÄúIn the Arcadia system, there‚Äôs a planet‚ÄîAurora III. It‚Äôs a nature reserve. No settlements, no industrial presence. Just oceans, forests, mountains untouched by war or diplomacy. I read about it once, a long time ago.‚Äù

Moreau leaned back, intrigued. ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

Eliara glanced away, as if the confession were something delicate, something that shouldn‚Äôt be said aloud.

‚ÄúI think I would like to see it.‚Äù

Moreau studied her for a long moment. Then, without a word, he turned to his terminal and began inputting a new set of coordinates.

Eliara blinked. ‚ÄúWhat are you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúPlotting a course,‚Äù Moreau said simply. ‚ÄúAurora III. It‚Äôs not far, and, as luck would have it, we have no pressing matters today.‚Äù He smirked. ‚ÄúUnless you‚Äôre going to tell me you suddenly have an urgent obligation.‚Äù

Eliara remained silent, watching him work.

She should have protested‚Äîshould have told him it was unnecessary, that it wasn‚Äôt a wise use of time. That it wasn‚Äôt important.

And yet.

As the ship began aligning for its new course, she realized something unexpectedly profound.

Currently friendly date which I will meet in over next 2 wks. After return to my home city from time in another province.  

After he mentioned he had a working adult son, 1 wk. into our email exhchnges, I literally had to ask if he was divorced and how long. (Past 9 yrs.) 

In contrast to my late spouse, he offered info during our lst coffee date, that he was recently divorced with 2 early teen children. My late spouse had an expensive court divorce so I knew he hurt.  ( she initiated the divorce). However perhaps with underage children, in shared child custody it was useful for me to know soon.  I didn't mind over next 12 months, bits of info. past marriage ie. them having a weekend farm, that they ride off on bikes from church wedding. 

I just wonder why present guy didn't offer he was divorced early in our emails nor in our later 1 hr.  video call.  After I clearly stated my widow status for past 4 yrs.

***I consider divorce a significant life event since there is also legal aspect and sometimes legal responsibilities.

Since he is a menace, he decided my cleaning efforts were not good enough. He needs chaos. His plan for achieving mayhem was easy: he must simply dig his poop and pee filled litter box until every piece of litter is on the floor! Bonus points if the water gets litter and poo inside (which it did)! He did this TWICE today. 

He also chose to do it during the only time I left them alone for the entire day - which was when I cooked lunch for myself!

After cleaning his mess and laying on the floor next to them, Coffee thought it would only make sense to beg for cuddles - since he needs to be emotionally recompensed.

But yet again, Coffee is a free bunny. He does not ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù, he yearns for adventure. So his stay on his dad‚Äôs lap for cuddles did not last long!

If you've never had a Lenormand reading before, you'll probably find it interesting, accurate and compelling. I personally find Lenormand to be very direct and literal most of the time, which takes away some of the anxiety and broader interpretations we find in tarot. This doesn't mean it's not capable of deep thought, though, as it definitely provides a lot of insight. 

Lenormand is a French divination system that dates to late 1700s, using cards that originally adapted coffee ground and tea leaf reading elements mixed with playing cards. The Lenormand system was named after Marie Anne Lenormand (Madame Lenormand) in the 1800s, in honor of her perfecting and specializing the cards used in the system. She's interesting! You should look her up if you're not already familiar.

im 24 and doing my masters. half of my friends are in a gap year (they're all a little younger, 21-22yo). 

my dad is severely disabled. my mom is his caretaker and she is falling apart. I think she is developing alzheimers (she does too, but wont get checked). my grandma got sick and forgot me (only me, and we used to be so close ):) so i am not calling her much anymore and i feel so so guilty. im pretty sure she does not have too much time left and i am missing out on the last time we have together because i am a chicken ):

my parents and i moved abroad at some point. tomorrow they move back to our home country. i have been spiralling over it because at least until they were here i could help them and keep an eye on them. now i cant, unless i drop out of uni which is not an option.

i think i just had a hypomanic episode (getting professional help for that rn but no diagnosis bc everyone is confused). if not hypomania, then its something physical. 
i used to have a pretty intense eating disorder and i think im currently having the worst relapse i have ever had. i spent the last 2 weeks crying and suicidal over a 3kg weight gain :DD 

i have exams next week and looks like ill fail (ED +w hatever hypomania-like episode i just had + family stress made it so i couldnt focus on uni work at all unfortunately). 

im losing my mind over that too because pre adhd diagnosis i dropped out of uni twice and im still haunted by that and so scared history will repeat itself. 

i have to find an internship for next year, and everyone is talking about it and making plans but i am blocking it out; 
idk if i get to have a future if my parents will need a caretaker? will i have to move back to their country and andandon everything i built here? do i get to live life for myself? their country (because i dont identify with it anymore) offers no prospects for someone with my degree but i cant abandon them. and thinking about my internship/interests/future forces me to grapple w these questions. 

MEANWHILE my friends just dont get it. they keep coming at me with expectations of hanging out, going out, spending time together etc etc and i feel so horrible saying it but it makes me angry because i look at all the shit that is happening in my life and their demands feel so silly. it feels like everyone is upset at me for not being there for them, and how dare they expect me to be there for their stupid inconsequential shit when my life is falling apart like this.

i tried talking about everything that is going on in my life and they truly dont understand. when i tried telling them that i thought i had a hypomanic episode they said ""ahaha i love it when im hypomanic"" (like in the ""isnt everyone a little adhd sometimes"" way). i tell them about my family and they (very right fully) cant imagine what it really means to be a caretaker/ how awful some diseases can really be. 

i pulled away because i need time alone and it feels like they are angry at me for being a bad friend. bas friend meaning im not hanging out with them on Fridays or not available to grab a coffee. and i am so angry at them. i feel like im having all these ""grown up problems"" but all my friends are still focusing on going partying and cute outfits and other college stuff and ugh

It‚Äôs heartbreaking. I‚Äôve never given her formula and have a good supply (about 33-34 oz). I‚Äôve had consistent pain with pumping our whole journey due to elastic nipples (tried so many different flanges and sizes) and vasospasms/shooting pains through my right breast that start with the pump and do not end until a few minutes after I stop pumping. I only ever pumped to facilitate nursing and to maintain supply when my daughter started sleeping through the night, and I would love to stop feeling shooting pains for hours per day that just remind me my nursing journey is over. I would also love the time and freedom back for work and my family (and wine and coffee and a normal appetite - my long dormant eating disorder has flared up mightily postpartum with the ravenous hunger even though I am as thin as I have ever been).

1jfrsmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1jfrsmq/coping_with_fear_of_abandonment/,Coping with fear of abandonment,"Long story short, but this year was really tough on my mental state because of job and marrige related issues. Also I parted ways with some of my old friends when they moved to another countries and simply stopped reaching out. 

It got harder when one of my best friends from high school  wrote me a long text right before my birthday, saying that ‚Äòshe cared about me, but would like to take a pause in our friendship because it is hard and doesn‚Äôt serve her anymore‚Äô.  I really cared about her and was always there for her when she needed to talk or simply vent about life. It probably was my mistake, but because of that I thought I could also tell her about my situation and ask for support. Even week before that text she sent me a positive TikTok with caption  like ‚Äòwhen you are besties‚Äô. So it was a huge shock to me, but I‚Äôve accepted what she wrote and didn‚Äôt try to talk her out of it. 

The other person that triggered that fear was a friend from work. I didn‚Äôt know him that long, about a year, but we connected because of the same work issues and started talking and going out for coffee. He invited me to a lot of interesting places and at first I was hesitant because I didn‚Äôt know his intentions (he is a man and I am in serious relationship), but I thought that the time proved that he wanted nothing from me and we became friends and supported each other.  Now I don‚Äôt understand what was going on in his mind because suddenly he started to ignore me and now It seems like he just stopped caring. Which I also accepted, but in reality this change really trigged me. 

I understand that it is life and people grow apart, no one owns anything to me, but sometimes I wish that something in this world could stay or some people could care about me the same way I care about them.  I‚Äôve realized that situations like this make me feel like something is really wrong with me and this is why people do that. And it makes harder for me to trust people, because I fear that something like that could repeat again.

Maybe a walk or coffee date, PTSD (or other ailments/injuries), wasted time and energy... 

Today I posted on a local page about my need for gravel and quickly knew based on all of the replies that since I was a woman posting I must know *nothing*. This also happened to me while I was building, many times the builder had to step in and say ""she knows more than you think"", just like in dating, men thought they could take advantage of me. Men are always trying to game women, how much can I extract and *how low will she go*?

This is why we are here, sharing stories, having each others back. This is how men treat us; my secret weapon, I have designed and built 4 homes and I know! If I can do it myself, I am. Replacing outdoor receptacles, tiling a patio, building a gate, outdoor TV cabinet and tabletop... I will spend hours learning something just not to have to deal with men (this also included my former husband when I was married). I spent hours, weeks, months sorting through garbage, wasting my own time dating. Just like the estimates I received today, I am not buying what they are trying to sell!

I left a coed college in the 80's to go to an all women's college, because men suck up all of the air. I worked in a 99% woman occupied profession, because men (it paid very poorly).  Collectively men have no idea how tired women are of them, I don't want to hear from them, I don't care what they want. There is peace and joy without men, they created this contrast and their own loneliness pandemic. 

Understanding the way men *really* see us is important, remove the blinders or rose colored glasses because this is the world we live in, women pay more in time, energy, health and money to live in this world. How much extra work do I have to do to meet with men and get an estimate? How much of your time have men wasted in dating?

1jfrpzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jfrpzi/there_are_actually_4_types_of_cappuccinos/,There are actually 4 types of cappuccinos.  Hopefully this clears up your confusion,"Hey everyone - we all know the old tail.. A Cappuccino has the most foam, a latte has the average, and the flat white has enough for delicate latter art.

**BUT**, if you are looking at this thread, you fall into one of two categories -

1 - You are still in your *amateur* days of espresso making and are just as confused as I was.

2 - You are a *rebel* that is ready for a fight.

Don't worry 2's, this is objective and covers everyone's bases in an objective sense. So here are the four types of cappuccinos, with a wrap-up at the end!

1. The ""**Italian-Style**"" Cappuccino

This wet cappuccino is traditionally made by steaming between 4-5 oz of milk into a 6-8 oz total volume of steamed milk (for a heaping 6.5 oz beverage).  It is micro-foam in its truest sense, but given how it is fluffier than your other milk drinks, your art is going to be limited to basic tulips and (maybe fancy) hearts.  If you go to Italy, you would expect this.  It is a very pleasant, cloud-like feeling to sip on.  **My Opinion:** >!This is by far the most enjoyable cappuccino.  No other mouth feel can beat it!!<

2) The ""**Wet**"" (Specialty Caf√©) Cappuccino

This cappuccino is interchangeable with a flat-white.  If you are like me, and have ordered a cappuccino at a specialty caf√©, you may be surprised at first with what you get.  It is a 6 oz beverage with beautiful latte art and a slightly more up-front espresso taste than a latte.  It is less foam than #1, but 100% microfoam.  **My Opinion:** >!This is enjoyable, as a flat white is, but I would just typically order a flat white if I actually wanted this!<

3) The ""**Dry**"" Cappuccino

The dry cappuccino is what a lot of Americans, Australians, and honestly probably most of the world expects when they order a cappuccino.  This is (when correctly) made using 4oz of milk by steaming it into microfoam.  However, instead of injecting whispers of air, you are more aggressively injecting air.  Some cheaper machines may require you to inject PAST the normal point.  Regardless, you still end with a vortex to break up bubbles more and keep the foam micro.  This cappuccino is almost completely white on top, and is really marshmellowy.  **My Opinion:**  >!I definitely do not hate when I receive this.  I love the feeling, though I prefer #1 since the espresso taste intermingles with the foam, where this one your first few sips are kinda just ""milk""!<

4) The ""**American**"" Cappuccino

This drink is made with your traditional double shot of espresso, just like the others, but for steaming the milk, you place the wand just beneath the surface of the center of the milk, and go up and down a bunch.  This starts with about 5-6oz of milk and ends with like 10 oz of foam.  The foam is similar to bubbles you get from cleaning dishes, and it goes into a latte-sized cup.  Okay, this one is really hard to be objective but I tried my best.  **My Opinion:** >!I am not too sure who was the first one to train baristas to do this, or if it is just LACK of training, but this is done at like 90% of basic cafes in America.  I cannot speak for other countries, but I almost never order a cappuccino at a place that serves Starbucks (or comparable) coffee or has 16 year olds as the baristas.. because I know what I drink is going to taste like burnt paper and feel like I am eating a sponge.  This one is terrible.. if you are making cappuccino at home, PLEASE do not do this.!<

So in conclusion, there are **FOUR** cappuccinos! Every video you see online will probably fall into one of the first three, so don't be scared if videos are conflicting! There are truthfully multiple types, just make the one that you love the most, and be prepared when you enter a caf√© that you may be receiving something different (unless you are specific and they are well-trained).

Growing up my dad was abusive in so many ways. My siblings supported each other about the abuse but they were not supportive towards me. They resented me because they felt like I was not as abused as they were but his abuse with me was only when it was me and him. I was five and easily manipulated believing him when he made me believe that he had a right to do it until I was 12 and told. First I tried to ask to speak to a counselor at the school but for some reason the teacher was rude and asked me in front of the class why I wanted to see a counselor and expected me to answer in front of the class. I decided to back down. I tried to go in the counselors office before school started but the counselor yelled at me to get out of her office. This scared me to go to the school for help. I later learned that my dad would tell the school I was a problem child. My cousin who stayed with us for a little bit but she abruptly left. She told her caseworker how my dad abused her and is so a caseworker came to talk to me at school. It was the first time I was heard so I told her everything. They took us out and arrested him. My siblings were so hateful towards me saying I ruined the family. As an adult my dad was living at our favorite grandma's and everyone would go over there. I was expected to act like everything is okay. He got out when I was 17 and was forced to visit and he wanted a hug from me but I didn't want to. Everyone was circled around me yelling at me to hug him like I was the problem. I was lied to and did not know I was going to see him. He just got out of jail and I was not ready. I was always uncomfortable at the way he looked at me and I tried to express it but my sister said it was because of the shirt I was wearing. This was the same sister that I told first about the abuse that told me she would protect me and turned on me. 

My brother was always abusive as well when my dad left but my sisters always took his side and said it was because my dad abused him. He was the worse to me and would ostracize me from the other siblings. My best friend who I would always vent to about his abuse had a huge crush on him despite his abuse and would always stand up for him because of the crush. I ended the friendship a year ago when she drunkenly taunt me and laughed like it was nothing saying she would go and sleep with him behind my back after I was venting about his cruelty. She would always use the phrase that she is playing the devils advocate when she stood up for him.

Right before Covid I became my other grandmother's caregiver. I didn't mind caring for her despite how scary it was for me. They knew I would be working a full time job and they expected it. It was under the agreement they would help and they would have someone helping and I would have days off. My first supportive day off my sister caught a wind of it and was mad about it so she hikacked my day off to make my mom make me help her with her shopping. It was only supposed to be a half day but she hijacked all of my to days off and I felt like I did not have a choice. This was the moment I felt like I lost my mind. She was supposed to help out but she bolted before this and would only show up to judge me. The whole time I was helping she judged me on being a caregiver. I was lucky to get an hour of sleep. My family was treating me badly and I only agreed to a certain caregiver but they took advantage of my timid personality. They never got the help. I ended up having to move in as she needed more help. Instead of being grateful they treated me as I was taking advantage. I had to pay rent as I was still paying rent on my place. They fired the lawn guy and expected me to do the lawn and other extra house things. My only job was to make sure she didn't fall but somehow found myself in this situation because they knew they could take advantage. Grandma was being racist towards me too. 

The same time my job was treating me horribly and bullying me. Having me pick up the slack of other coworkers while they got to chat and joke with the manager. I was being punished for being nice and not joining them when they were bullying the other girl that eventually quit. I have speech impediment and they thought it would be funny to force me to do the announcements and they would make fun of my voice. I would do my job but they would stop me to do their favorite's job first to yell at me about my area. My other coworker who was bullied had to go to the hospital while working while I was on vacation. I came back for them to yell at me for the mess that she left behind when she had to go to the emergency room. 

During lockdown my grandma was nice to me as there was no one else yelling in her ear about me. She was nice and we had a good time. I was having anxiety attacks about having to go back to that work environment always being yelled out. I felt confident about talking to my grandma about my worries. Something about lockdown helped her despite her fears of Covid. One morning she surprised me and even got up on her own and made her own coffee and small breakfast. She told me to tell work I can't go back because her as she told me our governor said that living with the elderly was a reasonable excuse for not going back. Besides, my job was not letting us face masks in the beginning before lockdown and did not want to lockdown and let us go home. She wanted me not to go back because they didn't care about safety. I did when they called and she was happy about it but asked me to not tell the family. When restrictions was lifted family came back to visit and after a week grandma became cruel. She became weak and was falling more. She fell when the family was there and they were helping her but they wanted to try to turn it around as me being abusive with their backhanded comments. I was not getting sleep and they could not even let me take a nap. My grandma told me to take a nap for them to wake me up to grab her a glass of water. They were yelling me about the lawn, plants, sweeping the roof, changing the plants. They were always nagging me about when I was going back to work despite it being a lockdown. These people have not worked in over 5 years.

She ended up having to go to the hospital because of her fall. They kept her for a couple of days but we could not be there because of Covid. They were bugging me to check on her instead of calling themselves because I wanted to finally sleep. I called in the morning and they would call for updates. They finally were sending her home and I asked if they could pick her up since I was too tired to drive and everything was blurry. They were ignoring me and finally leaving me alone. I finally had enough and said that if they felt I was not doing a good job with grandma they can do it themselves and I left. 

Of course they were finally able to find someone quickly to help take care of her and they rehired the lawn guy. She was still too much for them and tried to guilt me saying I should come back. At first it was nice with these promises. Then they say it would be the least I could do since I put the family through hell.",1,1742484729.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False

Today, I'm looking at $74.55 ( 5th time ) payout from that same idea turned into a real product - SneakyGuy.

The Spark

It all started when I found myself spending 40+ hours monthly just tracking conversations on Reddit that were relevant to my interests. I thought: ""There has to be a better way to do this."" Turns out, there wasn't. So I decided to build it.

The Late Night Grind

My schedule became predictable in its insanity:

Weekdays: 9-5 at my day job, dinner, then coding from 8 PM until my eyes couldn't stay open

Weekends: Wake up, coffee, code. Occasionally remember to eat.

I converted my living room into a workspace where empty energy drink cans competed for space with scribbled notes about database architecture and API challenges.

The First Version

The first version of SneakyGuy was ugly. Really ugly. But it worked - it could scan Reddit for specific keywords and alert me when conversations matched my interests. When I showed it to a friend and they immediately asked ""Can I use this too?"" I knew I might be onto something.

From Project to Product

Turning a personal tool into a product meant:
Adding user accounts

Building an actual interface that didn't require developer knowledge

Setting up payment processing (harder than it sounds!)

Learning about things I never thought I'd need: privacy policies, terms of service, customer support systems

I didn't have a massive Product Hunt launch or viral Twitter thread. Instead, I mentioned SneakyGuy in comments where someone was asking about lead generation. Initially few signed up that day. One of them actually paid.

Challenge

As SneakyGuy grew, so did my database. We're now tracking over 62 million submissions across more than 1 million subreddits. Processing this data to find patterns like optimal posting times became both a technical challenge and a key feature.
Seeing that $74.55 payout notification wasn't about the money (though it will cover my hosting costs). It was validation that solving my own problem could create value for others too.

What I Learned

Start by solving your own problems authentically
Your first version just needs to work, not look pretty

Getting even one paying customer changes everything psychologically
Data becomes your competitive advantage
Progress happens in tiny increments that feel insignificant until you look back

For anyone considering the side project path: it's not about having more time than others, it's about what you choose to do with the limited time you have. Those weekend hours and late nights add up, but only if you keep showing up consistently.

Attempting to do the 'play a sound' doesn't work (can't connect to any of them).   But here's the weird part:

My iPad was just sitting on the coffee table all night long.  I guarantee that it didn't ""go out for a walk"".   But all of those traveling with you notifications each show the exact same path.   From around a shopping center that is 2.5 miles away.

So I totally get the whole ""someone can be traveling alongside you on the highway"" ideas.  Or even random other notifications.

    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Didn't know exactly what flair to use (maybe 58? Eheh ok Sorry), hope this is the right one. 

I was wondering about water: 

In many posts/videos I read/see about the importance of water, soft water, using a filtering caraffe and so on,how good water for taste is not necessarily good water for the machine and so on. 

Now, my question is about taste: is good tasting water literally just... water I like? If it is a taste I like, then is it good for brewing coffee? Or is there something else that I should take into account (again, not talking about descaling, just taste)? Is there some guideline for that?

At such time my DRO guaranteed that I would be the permanent General Manager at this location, which was misleading, and even after they put my name on the front door and gave me business cards, 2025 calendars, coffee mugs, and a seat at the GM rally, they instead gave my cafe to a ""seasoned Panera GM"" who has done worse than what I had going. I had it out with my DRO and I was sent packing back to my AGM role and to a 4th cafe within my first 8 months with Panera. I was told that I was being fast-tracked to the GM position and that I could be groomed for regional positions but instead, I had my wings clipped. I was sent to the most toxic work environment I have ever encountered in my career which spans 18 years of management. yayaya I'm being readied to have my own cafe in or around June and then I was terminated. 

My peers pleaded with me to bring this to HR, but I am not willing to waste my energy on a company such as Panera and there are no circumstances that would forgive my first and only year with Panera.

Did that since I was dealing with a lot of paranoia(that i'm going to talk to a therapist about) that popped back up again(worried about cameras in places, and things watching me and people giving me weird looks), A couple weeks ago I drank some coffee before class, got to campus and just felt so off about how the people were standing on the grass and felt like the people standing were going to do something bad. Also feeling like there was a hidden camera in the car.

Also felt like my mind got opened up/became less porous kinda and i started going back to thinking others knew what I thinking. Its happened before and then felt like it closes back up and all is fine.

And after I quit coffee and most of my tea intake(replaced with copious amounts of water), started working out, all that stopped.

Feels like some of the spiritual stuff was just here cause very recently we found out a relative was nearing their end. The rest of it is just in limbo occasionally communicating via life events. Which eh not actually a big deal. Just in the background somewhere unless I have coffee.

So I feel like either 1. theres something in the coffee(but my parents drink the same coffee and they're fine). 2. I might be on the verge of some issue cause it didn't cause a sh-t ton of paranoia always. Or at least I don't remember it causing alot of paranoia. 3. I'm 21 and very slowly developing some issue cause the paranoia didn't completely stop the spiritual stuff just slowed down.

I have had my Bialetti 2 pot Induction Moki Pot for 3 months and it's been great this whole time, I am completely new to Moka Pots but I've not had any problems getting it to work.

Suddenly, it's started working only 1 times out of 2. I set it to go as usual and realised it was taking too long, then that it was making tiny high noises and a little water was starting to come out of the part that screws together at the middle. No coffee was coming into the pot at all.

I cleaned it carefully and couldn't find anything that looked clogged. Set it to go again the next day, and it went fine, so I assumed it was all OK. Tried again a couple hours later and had the exact same problem as before. Water trying to force out the middle, no coffee coming up.

I noticed when I took it apart this time that the coffee wasn't even wet. I tried flipping the rubber gasket upside down (wasn't sure what else) and tried again, and it was fine. 

Then the last time I tried, exact same problem again.

Does anyone else recognise this issue? Friend says the gasket might need replacing, but it's only 3 months old, and as getting a replacement is going to be an expensive pain in the but, I don't want to do that unless I'm pretty sure that's the problem.

1jfreb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/1jfreb6/the_not_so_secret_ingredients_for_an_engaging/,The not so secret ingredients for an engaging Youtube channel - The Top Gear formula,"I have a theory on how to make an engaging Youtube channel and I'd like to share it with you.

First of all, people watch TV/YT for 2 main reasons, Entertainment and information.  
The third reason being white noise (sound you're not paying attention to while doing something else).

Entertainment can be comedy, storytelling and information is learning something.  
Both keep the viewer engaged.

As a content creator you want as many views as possible, but everyone is different, you can't possibly appeal to everyone.

Here's where the Top Gear formula comes in, for those that don't know, Top Gear was one of the most popular TV shows for a while.  
Why?  
Because it blended entertainment with information.

The main topic of Top Gear was cars. The majority of the population don't care about cars, for most people they are just a tool to move around. The thing is, at a certain point in life most people will get a car, so how does one create a TV show and educate people on cars if most people don't care about them?

The answer is coat it in a good dose of entertainment, **Top Gear was 70% comedy and 30% car information**, and that's the 2 main reasons people watch TV, if you combine the 2 then you catch the people who seek entertainment and the ones that seek information.

You might not be interested in the top speed and braking power of a Volvo, but you might be interested when it careens off a cliff because it's reached it's top speed and didn't break on time.

  
This formula doesn't have to be entertainment + information. You could also **combine niches to catch multiple audiences seeking different things**, you just have to make sure to keep them mixed and **never alienate one audience in favor of the other**.

The Witcher 3 videogame uses a **40 seconds rule** to keep users engaged, this is when wandering around the world, every 40 second there is something interesting in the level design, an encounter or something that breaks up the monotony of walking.

A similar timing could be used in videos making sure you re engage users attention so they don't get bored and click away, this should be done for each of your audiences, so a new piece of information and a new piece of comedy every 40 seconds would keep both groups engaged.

Luckily comedy is quite universally liked, so if you're blending comedy + information, you can lean more heavily on comedy and keep information sparse, as the seeking information will probably be also engaged by the comedy.

  
Now let's take a look at a few YT channel examples. 

My favorite Youtube channel is Abroad in Japan, I started watching it when I was planning a trip to Japan, but even after the trip I keep watching the channel, because of the entertainment.

Another one is Linus Tech Tips, a tech channel showing new Tech products, they use a one take policy, if they make a mistake they just keep rolling and that adds to the comedy.   
While I do like tech, I often don't find the items that they cover particularly interesting, but I keep coming back for the entertainment and as a bonus I learn more about tech.

With me as an example, you can see they caught me with the niche, but they kept me as a viewed for years to come, people grow and change, their tastes might change, but if you cater to at least one, they will come back.

Now what if your channel is not suitable for comedy? What if you're covering more serious topics?

A good example is a video by Drew Binsky I watched yesterday about Syria's new government, I have no interest in world events or politics, and I would have never clicked on that video unless I knew what the channel is about and what it offers for me, which is showing me places to travel to and showing me the culture.

This applies to any kind of business, would you go to a coffeeshop that makes just coffee or one that makes coffee, has a nice view and has free wifi?

  
TLDR: If you want a successful channel, try to combine multiple niches and interests into your videos, bring people in that seek different things, bring them in with one interest but keep them coming by offering more",3,1742484198.0,NewTubers,2,0.8,False

For context I (27F) and my boyfriend (36M) have been in an open relationship for a some time and everything is awesome between us. We've been casually ""seeing"" other people and we've never had any problems with each other or with other people.

A few months back I reacquainted myself with an old group of friends (all around 25) because I've been going to convention each year with one of them. One night we were out for drinks and during the conversation the status of my relationship was brought up in front of everyone and everything went well. Later, a couple came and told me since I've been living far away from the bar we go to, I could sleep on their couch if I was uncomfortable going home on my own - which happens quite often. Let's call them Thorin(M) and Thogila(F).

At this point we talked about going to the next convention all together. Most of them were busy but a few said yes. I told them I was going to do a cosplay, which I never done because I wasn't feeling safe (being a girl cosplay usually are a bit revealing) but since I wasn't alone it was ok. (It bears some importance at the end)

I talked a lot with Thorin since we used to be pretty tight 3 years back and he wanted to adopt a dog and I have one. I offered to go on a walk with my dog and him to explore his neighborhood's dog friendly places. After the tour we went back to their place and we had a nice drink and talk all together with a friend of mine I was hosting and Thogila. At some point my friend was tired and offered to bring my dog back at my place. A couple of hours later Thogila went to bed because of her allergies' medication. I was left with Thorin on the couch looking at a movie. The hugs started to be well... not really friendly. Before anything went down, I asked him if his girlfriend and him were in an open relationship and he said yes if it's just kissing and for the rest he needed to ask Thogila (their status was never been brought up before). I trusted him and we cuddled and kissed. He went to bed after a few hours.

The next morning after I got back to my place I insisted he talked to Thogila after my boyfriend telling me I might have been a bit naive trusting him. We talked for a bit and I told him I enjoyed his girlfriend too (kind of expecting a 3some). And he told me she was interested too.

We went for a few nights out after that and everything went well. I slowly started to ""try"" to flirt and she seemed responsive.

One night we were drunk we went back to their place - at that point I was clearly expecting a 3some- we put a movie on the tv but Thogila went to bed. Thorin and I started to fool around on the couch and at some point we were half naked and Thogila came back. Seeing us she started crying. I felt so bad. I took a taxi back to my place for them to sort things out. A few days later Thogila and I set up a meet to talk about what had happened.

From what I gathered from her, he did asked her about me and she said she had to think about it - really not what I was told - and he did say I was interested by her, which she welcomed but still said she had to think about. However he did lie about the kisses and didn't tell her, it was never ok to begin with. She quickly put it upon an error in communication on their part and we parted with her saying she still needed time but was still open to the idea.

We kept going for drinks with the group of friends but I tried giving them some extra space to figure stuff out. Each time I had a bit too much to drink - I usually become extra on hugging everybody - and Thogila went home, Thorin came on to me with hugs. At first it was just hugs so I told myself it was ok since I usually hug everybody anyway.

Fast forward a bit, one night Thogila was out of town and we were really drunk. Thorin offered his couch and I said yes. We went to second base. Next morning, realizing it was probably not ok for Thogila I decided to go home and stop hanging out with them since I couldn't contain myself. Thogila asked me to meet her. We went to have a coffee she asked so I told her what had happened. She was angry so I told her I decided to distanced myself from the group. She told me not to, that I wasn't responsible for this (I surely did feel responsible), and to still come hang out. So I did. And history repeated itself. Drunk we went to second base with Thorin. I met Thogila for drinks a few days later and this time I said I was out.

A few weeks later, Thogila asked me for a drink again, I went and she said she thought about it and she was ok for me to go all the way with Thorin but she was out. It happened a few time. One day we were at their house, Thogila, Thorin, an other girl Thorin was seeing (at that point it was ok for him to see other woman) and me for a dinner and boy did I cringe. The discussion was full on ""Thorin and his harem"" and the feminist in me screamed. I got out of it all telling them I wasn't confortable anymore. Thorin and I talked a bit and he thought it was because he was seeing someone else (which makes no sense to me because I'm already the other woman) and I told him the harem thing was kind of the last straw for an already uncomfortable situation but he kept insisting so I cut contact with Thorin.

After all that I contacted the one of the group I usually go to convention with and on a group message with everybody he told me they all talked together and that considering what I had done to Thogila nobody wanted to go with me on the convention.

I (27f) work in an office for a plant nursery. I'm the only female.
I have an assistant manager, let's call him Randy (30s, married, wife pregnant with baby 2)
I have a manager, we'll call Mark (60s, married, many kids and grandkids)
And the other guys are irrelevant tbh cause I barely speak to them.

My assistant manager is the type to just constantly want friendly conversation with everyone, much like my manager.
Theyll both do things like butt-in when im having a conversation with a customer, come up randomly and he like ""what's your favorite place to buy coffee?"" Or even pick on the other guys a lot like ""we won't sell any plants if you keep putting your face in the photos for the customers hahaha"".

Theyre just goofy. My boyfriend thinks it's cute when Mark does it. We both agree he's like a father figure to me, we are very close and have been for years.
Randy has only been here since maybe August, we aren't very close but we joke here and there.

Today I texted my boyfriend (30m) that Randy was picking on me because I thought it was funny in like an annoying sibling  kind of way,  which has happened before and was fine.

Me: Randy was picking on me today üôÑ

Him: Why? I don't like that shit

Me: He was saying stuff like ""do you want some coffee with your milk? That's basically just milk and sugar, are you a kid?"" Etc. Lol.

Him: I hate that friendly shit. Did you laugh? Or smile? He thinks you're being goofy with him.

Me: I? I don't know? What's wrong with him being goofy?

Him: You don't understand men. He gonna get too comfortable with you and try something.
And you don't know? So there's a chance or you aren't telling me everything. 

Me: Not all men are like that? Some are just goofy in general? Like Mark?

Him: Oh so you're saying not all men as if you're holding out hope? Like you don't have a man already? Interesting.

Me: Im sorry but this is insane. And I'm at work and you're stressing me out by pulling at air for a problem. I love you I hope you have a great day.

So I (23F) have lived in this apartment since 2021, and most of the time have lived with people and had no problem with.  I would say I‚Äôm a pretty inoffensive roommate, I generally clean up after myself, I do a deep clean when I find areas need it, I‚Äôm not generally noisy, I‚Äôm just comfortable in my space and respectful of others‚Äô.  

The apartment has been pretty much the same since 2021.  We don‚Äôt have any rules but we just have all kept things respectful but maintain an understanding that we‚Äôre human and sometimes things get left about or collect dust.  All of us who have lived here are full time students, work, and have social lives so sometimes things get busy.  What we‚Äôve done in the past is if, for example, there are some dishes (even if they‚Äôre not ours) and we have the time, we do them all.  I usually do all the dishes in the sink like 1-3 times a week, schedule dependent, and I‚Äôve never felt like myself or others weren‚Äôt pulling our weight.

I had two new girls move in, let‚Äôs call one N (20F) who is so sweet, I‚Äôve never had an issue with her (other than some mild weaponized incompetence) and she moved in a few months ago.  She‚Äôs rarely home and when she is, she generally keeps to herself and cleans up her messes.  The other one, let‚Äôs call A (21F) just moved in last week.  On the FaceTime call just to get a feel for her and see if she was the right fit, I asked if she was a neat freak.  I‚Äôve never lived with someone I would consider a neat freak, but I‚Äôm pretty type B so, while the apartment is clean, it isn‚Äôt always sparkling clean.  She said she wouldn‚Äôt consider herself one, so I thought it would be a great match (I told my boyfriend this a couple days after she moved in and he said that people that they wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúconsider‚Äù themselves neat freaks always are).

It hasn‚Äôt even been a week and she‚Äôs laid out a bunch of ground rules, even though I explained to her in the FaceTime call that we‚Äôve never used a chore chart and explained how we go about keeping the apartment clean.  She‚Äôs sent passive aggressive messages about making sure we clean our dishes within 24 hours because she likes to cook and can‚Äôt have dishes in the sink when she does it (???), that she‚Äôs monitoring whether we squeegee the shower after we use it, and was appalled that there was some leftover cat litter crumbs in the corner of the living room under the couch from a previous roommate.

The thing is, these are all understandable, it‚Äôs the smaller actions that are pissing me off.  
- She complained endlessly about how the shower isn‚Äôt draining well and that we need to get drain cleaner, but refused to do it (she‚Äôs home 24/7).  It hasn‚Äôt really bothered me that it doesn‚Äôt drain well, so I wanted to suggest that she do it, but I caved and did it anyways.  
- I came home one day to find her chipping away at the stuff accumulated on the oven (ancient oven and that stuff had been accumulated from past tenants, it‚Äôs just a part of the oven now) with my nice knife that I bought for myself.  Now, I recognize that this knife probably made its way to the communal drawer, but it‚Äôs the fact that she used the only (very clearly) nice knife in the drawer to do this.
- She emptied the garbage, but instead of taking it out to the trash bins outside, she just left it next to the bin in the kitchen.  As of now, it‚Äôs been there for 3 days.  Granted, she may not know how to take out the garbage (being very generous here with my assumptions, as I‚Äôve verbally told her how) but she could very well ask for help.
- I have OCD and grew up an only child, so being bothered by this is probably attributed to that, but I have a cup and straw that I use for my coffee every morning.  I usually let it dry on the rack, and it never gets put away cause I just use them so often.  It‚Äôs been two days and my cup is nowhere to be found.  The other roommate, N, wouldn‚Äôt be to blame because she knows that that‚Äôs my cup and straw.
- All 3 of us share one cramped bathroom.  It sucks, but it is what it is, and it‚Äôs never been a huge issue.  I was away at my parent‚Äôs house for a couple days and I receive a message to the group chat from N asking if anyone was in the bathroom since the door was closed.  A responded that she wasn‚Äôt in the bathroom.  N asked if we can just make sure to leave the bathroom door open just so it‚Äôs not confusing.  A then responded (kind of passive aggressively) that it wasn‚Äôt her and that she was confused too.  It definitely wasn‚Äôt me because a) I wasn‚Äôt there, and b) I know to leave the door open, because I‚Äôve been victimized many a time by the closed bathroom door.  The next day, N was away at school and it was just me and A.  I go to the bathroom, purposely leaving the door wide open.  I hear A go into the bathroom, and after she‚Äôs out, I head to the shower.  Door‚Äôs closed fully.  This happens repeatedly, each time I pass the bathroom, I open the door fully to kind of set an example.  Still an issue.
- The last one has to do with dishes.  After she sent the message about having our dishes done within a certain time frame, I did mine.  Not everyone‚Äôs just mine.  If we‚Äôre being monitored, I‚Äôm just going to do my own.  The next morning, N‚Äôs dishes were still in the sink.  Nothing unreasonable, just maybe a pan and some plates at most.  I wake up at about 8 to the sound of dishes banging loudly, and for a while too, it wasn‚Äôt just one plate that maybe slipped.  It felt purposeful and kind of petty.

I just want to know, am I overreacting or reading into things?  This may all be attributed to having lived with type B, but still clean people like myself this whole time.  I don‚Äôt really know where to go from here since she plans on being here for a long time.  I‚Äôm tempted to move out, but I‚Äôm canonically stubborn so moving out feels like she wins.

I was a contractor for a state government. My work life balance was incredible. I was making $150k but also paying quite a lot out of pocket for health insurance.  No PTO, etc. low cost of living area. I have 3 young kids, and my wife stays home. It was the most incredible year of my life. 
 
A change in policy put us in the office 3 days per week. Short 20 minute commute. No highway. Then I had a major family event that caused me to seek full time benefits. 

Found a job for a major financial institution. 3 days per week hybrid. 160k base. 20k bonus. Great benefits. On a good day the commute is an hour and 10 or 20. A bad day and it‚Äôs hour and 45. The role has tremendous upside. Very clear promotion path. Can be making 200k in a few years which is a ton of money here. This job role and company is resume gold. 


However ever since I started this job in fall of 2024 I feel like a hamster on a fucking wheel. There is never anytime to do shit. 11ish hours per week are just gone from commuting. It‚Äôs hard for my wife to load up all 3 small kids and go out by herself. So 3 days per week we basically cannot get anything done outside the house. The other 2 days I work from home. I end up working until 6pm to accommodate west coast co workers. So after work it‚Äôs dinner an hour or two playing with my kids. Then off to bed. Where I try to live my entire adult life in 3-4 hours because I have no other me time. Which leads to staying up late, Sunday scaries before commute days, waking up late rushing out the door to be in rush hour interstate traffic with psychopaths. 


I have an offer to be 100% fully remote. No offices at all. 135k salary around 155k with bonus. The benefits are better than what I have now. Over a week more of PTO. The role is objectively a downgrade title wise, but it is very similar to what I was going as a contractor. I can reduce most of the pay cut where the monthly budget stays about the same. Getting rid of my car I bought just to make the commute more comfortable $8400 per year(have cheap old Honda civic sitting around that is fine for wfh second family car). $2400 per year for parking. Probably another $1200 per year eating out for all the times I forget my lunch rushing out the door. Not counting charging my EV or unpaid commute time. 


I am torn on what to do. My life felt perfect when I was fully remote. Closing my laptop at 4pm sometimes. Loading up the family, going to the store together. Getting home cooking dinner. Being able to cook lunch for my wife and kids during my lunch break to take stress off of her. Being able to sleep past 6am without feeling like ‚Äúoh shit I have to GO I‚Äôm going to be so late to the office.‚Äù Being able to drink morning coffee in bed with my wife before the kids wake up. Realizing that time is a finite resource and my children will never be this young again. Them coming in my home office randomly hugging me. Me being more patient and kind to my family because I wasn‚Äôt so stressed out. 

I am just now starting to hit a stride at my current job. I am getting good at it. The initial imposter syndrome that accompanies every new job has worn off and I am very comfortable in my skin job role wise. It just feels hard to walk away from what feels like an opportunity that sets up my career for the next 20-30 years.

On our outgoing flight with Korean Airlines we had a 55 minute layover in Seoul which was very common in search. Surely that can't be enough time especially with our unfamiliarity with the airport and language but a Google search said you need a minimum of 45 minutes so we took a chance seeing as the next best itinerary was nearly 10 hours longer. It worked out way better than expected. We were greeted by a Korean Airlines employee who escorted us to our connecting gate, skipping the line for security and passport control. And our checked bags arrived no problem.

I had planned to buy some clothing in Vietnam which I often do when traveling. My rule of thumb - all you really need is a passport and credit card, everything else is optional (relax, already - don't over pack for every conceivable contingency). And clothing from another continent can be great keepsakes. Well, I couldn't find any clothing in Vietnam for my middle aged American body (6' tall, about 20 lbs overweight). I suspect that I would have had better luck at the mall as opposed to the many sellers in the Old Quarter Hanoi but even at the high-end clothing stores (a tiny minority) you needed to be Calvin Klein model thin. Bring clothing - and shoes you know to be comfortable and non-chafing with all day walking. For me this was Brooks running shoes. $180.00 USD in Vietnam - two weeks salary on average so not to be found easily.

Carry napkins and maybe some wet-wipes. The casual restaurants have tiny, unsubstantial napkins both at the table and the hand-washing stations. And you use a garbage bin for tissue when toileting (helped tremendously by the ubiquitous and powerful butt sprayers). I would bring this with you as substantial disposable tissues and wet wipes are uncommon in the markets.

Sun block is expensive and also uncommon. The locals smartly use long sleeved clothing, hats and hoodies, even gloves for protection on a hot day. Bring your own sunblock. And a packable hat, if you have a favorite.

Laundry service is fast, cheap, and readily available. I always plan to do laundry once in a 10-14 day trip and pack accordingly. This is super simple in Vietnam as opposed to, say, a half day at a coin-op laundry in Europe. I also use quick wash and dry underwear (Exofficio boxer briefs) and Smartwool 100% marino wool socks good for several days without odor (seriously). Also I am exceedingly careful when I eat - this is always how you ruin a shirt and pants for repeat wear and extra important when using chopsticks. A Tide pen and tough *non-shedding* cloth to wet and wipe will rescue you in real time. Bring this with you.

Cash is king in Vietnam. ATMs are everywhere but often out of cash, with significant fees, and limits on withdrawal - typically 2,000,000 VND (about $80.00 USD). You can simply withdraw twice but the fees add up and it kinda feels sketchy (?) with the ""preferred"" banks being hard to find and out of cash in the touristy areas. I would consider bringing crisp new $100.00 US bills if I return (and I Will return) for exchange in the many places that offer this. They don't have tap-to-pay and credit cards are not preferred and carry fees. It is true that the locals will try to ""scam"" you. For example I was interested in some beer coozy souvenirs and the price went from 300,000 VND to 200,000 to 100,000 in mere seconds. Still too much (?) but what do I care? What, am I going to nickel and time some poor shop keeper who's earning less than a dollar an hour? Be generous and respectful for crying out loud. It's literally chump change with your foreign dollar. I was happily ""scammed"" on several occasions, and a two dollar tip can be ""generous"". Different for you young backpacker types on a budget, to be sure.

Tentatively, sticking to partners who are your law school's alumni and work in a field of your interest seems like the best modus operandi in this situation, given you have solid grades and attend a law school with decent reach.

Currently, I am assembling a voluminous spreadsheet (with over 100 potential contacts thus far) of my law school's alums who work in big law as partners and specialize in my sought-after legal field, which I will employ during winter break of 2025. I excluded associates because they lack the pull that a partner otherwise has; however, I concede that a partner may be less receptive to a cold email, given that many of them are far removed from law school.

I do not plan on asking for a job or summer associate position off the bat. What I plan to do is lay out my due diligence on the partner's work and the firm's, express my interest in learning more about the partner and the work they do, mention how their legal field and associated duties align with mine, and ask them to grab a coffee, with the ultimate hope of building a connection that could potentially lead to a summer associate position.

Ultimately, I am hoping to seek some advice from people who have taken the cold email route for big law and am wondering how it worked for them, whether it be contacting partners or associates. Though, as I mentioned, I would think contacting partners is more effective.

1jfr11m,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeCry/comments/1jfr11m/today_i_discovered_that_my_friend_who_stopped/,Today I discovered that my friend who stopped answering my calls and texts in Covid times is stricken with severe dementia and doesn‚Äôt remember me,"For context, the friend is in their early 70s, 45 years my senior. I knew them from ever since I was a young boy, we met through the dog park. In my mid 20s we developed a special bond when I was adrift in life and needed direction. She became a mentor to me. She was a pioneer as the first female in her field of expertise in my country and was fiercely independent, so I had always admired her spirit  and cherished our friendship.

We would catch up once a month for coffee or a meal and she‚Äôd give me guidance, but then in 2015 I moved interstate, so we largely stayed in touch by calls or text. The last time I saw her in person was 2019 and then Covid hit and my city was plunged into the most longstanding continuous lockdown in the world. It was years before I returned to my hometown.

From June 2020, my friend stopped answering my calls and replying to my messages, with one exception. Every so often I‚Äôd try and touch base but got no response. Then in mid 2023 I sent her some birthday well wishes, hoping she was well and she responded with a somewhat garbled message saying she was in hospital, so it was not all that fun a birthday. I responded inquiring what she was in for and hoping all was okay. I signed off saying

>‚ÄôHope you‚Äôve still been living life to the full as always. Love to catch up for a chat one day soon üíú‚Äô

My phone shows she read it, but she never responded. Aside from a random location pinpoint she sent later that I day, for some unknown reason, I never heard from her again. I figured maybe I‚Äôd said something to upset her somehow and just accepted that.

About a year ago, I moved back to my hometown to be closer with family after a battle with cancer. I felt like a failure moving back and had fallen into a deep depression, so besides having a decently large number of friends, only about 3 of them know that I‚Äôve returned.

Today, I revisited my old neighbourhood and went for a walk at the dog park for old times sake. I made an attempt to call my friend‚Äôs mobile, but it went straight to a generic voicemail. I tried her home phone and got the same. Concerned, I immediately googled her name and ‚Äòobituary‚Äô. Thankfully nothing popped up.

I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was truly wrong and I drove by her house, something that I would never normally do to someone unannounced. As I pulled up, an unfamiliar lady stepped out the front door and I asked if she lived there. She in turn asked who I was looking for. I said my friend‚Äôs name and she immediately responded with another question: ‚Äòyou know what happened to her, right?‚Äô

‚ÄòNo,‚Äô I responded.

‚ÄòShe has severe dementia,‚Äô she replied, or words to that effect.

Then my friend shuffled slowly out the door, moving forward 4 inches at a time. Her eyes were full of tears. She looked at me and asked ‚Äòwho is this?‚Äô.

Turns out the woman was a carer and my friend is now under 24/7 care.

Kindly, the carer said that they were going for a walk and asked if I would like to join. We made it only less than 20m from the front gate before my friend wanted to go back. As we walked back, my eyes began to well up. I‚Äôve always found it difficult to cry. The last time I can truly recall was about ten years back when my father died. I didn‚Äôt cry when I found out I had cancer, I didn‚Äôt cry when the woman I was going to marry and I broke up, but very quickly this had tears pouring down my cheeks.

We returned and the carer asked if I‚Äôd like to come inside and have a cup of tea. I stayed there and chatted with the carer and my friend, and although my friend didn‚Äôt remember me or my family (or my dogs from over the years) and I was instructed to not ask her about anything from the past, I showed her pictures of us and of my family and explained who they were.

For the next two hours I shared stories with the carer and learned about what had happened in the time since we lost touch. She shared stories from my friend‚Äôs past that I‚Äôd never heard, like a trip she‚Äôd made down to Antartica.

At the end of the two hours, my friend wanted to go to bed, and the carer‚Äôs shift was coming to an end, so I left, but the carer said I was welcome to come back and visit anytime, although indicated that my friend likely doesn‚Äôt have much time left. I said I‚Äôd try and visit every week after I finished my shift volunteering on that side of town.

I left feeling sad, but the tears had long since dried up. Although she didn‚Äôt have a clue who I was anymore, I still felt a sense of joy from seeing my friend and from the glimpses of her old self that still existed within.

I have literally hundreds of messages from all over the world that I have been avoiding because of depression and shame. All unanswered, many unread. Although I haven‚Äôt been responsive, I think about the people and the need to message each and every one of them back almost every day.

If I can give anyone who has read this one piece of advice, please if you have lost contact with a friend or haven‚Äôt heard back for sometime, please put in the extra effort to reestablish contact. And if a friend hasn‚Äôt been responsive to you after repeated attempts, and you can‚Äôt identify anything you did wrong, please don‚Äôt dismiss it as a cold shoulder. 

Whether due to dementia or depression (as in my case), people have all manner of ailments that can affect their ability to communicate and even just the attempt to make contact can mean the world.",39,1742483205.0,MadeMeCry,3,1.0,False

But it's still useful as a very broad rule if thumb and I saw online recently that people use it the other way round, to see how much of your pot is needed for everyday spending. 

For instance in the following 3 examples;  

¬£10/m on Spotify 
¬£35/m for gym membership 
¬£4/w for a take away coffee. 

If you annualise these costs then divide by 4% you get an idea of how much of your pot you'll need for these items if you were to carry them on into retirement, which would be;  

Spotify ¬£3,000
Gym ¬£10,500
Coffee ¬£5,200. 

Of course this assumes these costs will rise in line with inflation and you continue with them until you die, but still of limited use if you're on the limit budget wise and in the fence of what to keep in your life and what to jettison.

Finally also useful for when you're saving money, e.g. if you renegotiate your broadband for ¬£10/m less, that's ¬£3k less you need in your pot ",12,1742483122.0,FIREUK,5,1.0,False

I smiled at her and she smiled back so I approached. We had a really nice conversation, she was friendly and asked me reciprocal questions.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I am blown in the mindhole,"2 years ago I fell into the espresso rabit hole and after some consideration, my wife and I settled on the Breville Barista Max. It has a grinder built in, and you could set up pre infusion profiles, regulate temperature etc. Frankly quite a decent machine for the price, and I enjoyed espressos and milk drinks with it.

A while ago I went into a coffee place in Utrecht and I had the best espresso of my life. It was a lighter Ethiopian roast. It is the first time I could taste the ""acidity"" from the citrussy descriptions on the coffee. 

I know my breville struggled with dialing lighter roasts, and i splurged a bit, having full support of my wife:p. I first got the grinder last week, which has flat burs, and I was already blown away by the difference in tastes with the same beans. I understand now that so called ""clarity"" texture profile thing people are talking about. 

Today the Profitec Go arrived and I made my first espresso and latte with it. It just keeps on being better and better. I love both machines so much. I love the engineering behind it. They are beautiful machines capable of making increadible coffee.

I am looking forward each morning to make coffee, and to make lattes for my wife. 

I get it now. I probably won't have to upgrade for decades. And many espressos will be had during those decades.

Happy Coffee !

We've been together for 7 years and live about 4hrs away from her parents, 68M and 70F, and her developmentally disabled brother, 30M. Her family likes me well enough, but the parents can be a little suspicious as I come from a very different family situation.

Now retired, my partner's parents are just starting the process of figuring out what happens to BIL after they die such as writing a will, naming a guardian, and securing permanent housing for him. A couple of weeks ago, I tried to do the gentlemanly thing and take my future FIL to coffee to ask his permission to marry his daughter. He refused, assuming that I was trying to meddle with the will and guardianship stuff. 

In the end, my partner had to step in and clarify the situation. I get the impression that I have overstepped and offended them in some way, though I'm not sure exactly where I went wrong.

I'm admittedly a bit out of my depth with the whole will and guardianship stuff. Now, I'm wondering if we should consider a pre-nup to clarify my role regarding caring for future BIL. Or maybe I should just have an open discussion with my future in laws establishing boundaries around BIL? As parents of autistic children, how would you want your future daughter-in-law to approach your family dynamics?

He played 3 months (October to December) with the Mavericks and the first 2 months of shooting look eerily similar to the first 2 months he has played with the Lakers so far (February and March) in similar injury related circumstances. 

The third month with the Mavericks shows promising signs that his shot might be coming back to a demonic level just in time for the playoffs. 

**The first month after Injury - The brutal slog**

> October 2024: 5 Games, 27.2 PPG, 38.7% FG, 29.2 3P%, 48.9% TS

> February 2025: 7 games, 21 PPG, 37.3% FG, 24.1% 3P, 49.5% TS

In both months, his shot looks atrocious, his TS% is nearly identical for both months and close to the worst among volume scorers, he is shooting below 40% FG and 30% 3P and seems to be trying too hard to shoot himself back to form. Even free throws seem like a slog. He will occasionally shoot the most outrageous contested one legged shot clock beating shot but can‚Äôt make the most open 3s. It‚Äôs hurting his confidence and spilling over to other parts of his game. He looks more like a top 15 player than top 5. 

**The second month after injury - Don‚Äôt let me make just one or you‚Äôre done**

> November 2024: 9 games, 28.2 PPG, 46.6% FG, 34.4% 3P, 58.8% TS

> March 2025: 9 games, 30.8 PPG, 42.6% FG, 40.2% 3P, 58.7% TS

The swagger is back, the shit talking is back, he starts killing teams in the 1st Q, his TS% is again basically identical for both months and has gone up by an entire 10% and is now comfortably above league average. He is still in recovery though so tends to get hot early on and go on streaks but as the game goes on but he struggles to put the needed weight into his jump shots and can go cold for long stretches or even games if he is fatigued. All in all, his passing is still world class, he is efficient overall and does serious damage when the scores are level at the most important time. He is now comfortably a top 4 player in the league, warts and all.

**The third month after Injury - Hey, kids do you like violence?** 

> December 2024: 8 games, 30.3 PPG, 52.3 FG%, 41.1% 3P%, 65.4% TS

> April 2025: Fingers crossed, look at December statlines, history doesn‚Äôt repeat itself but it rhymes.

The efficiency is laughter inducing for his shot diet, his mid range is demonic as difficult shots turn into a hunter‚Äôs game, he seems to be able to hypnotically freeze defenders with his Decels, his 3P is one of the best in the league, allowing him to enter the paint is death, teams start defending him from the other side of the court, starts playing solid team defence on top of his excellent lane interceptions, his passing is even more dangerous. He is the best player in the NBA if you know ball. 

Then he gets injured for a couple of weeks and Nico, after seeing what Luka did in December, quote ‚Äòhas very little sympathy due to his conditioning‚Äô, asks Luka to just sit for a month and decides to text his old pal Rob setting up a date in an expensive coffee shop in LA for a meeting which will alter NBA history forever.

This isn't my first time in OC but I've never really gotten to explore it and the neighboring towns! 

I'm from Seattle and love all kinds of food, I also love coffee and bubble tea places! Since I'm solo I'd prefer places where solo dining is comfortable! 

I also love antique and vintage shopping so any jewelry, clothing, or furniture places you know would be great recs! Feel free to also just drop stores you think are fun to shop in as well. I also like snowboarding/skateboarding and like to browse sports shops to see what stuff they have on sale. 

Also while I do love the beach I'm an avid hiker in WA so I spend a lot of time in somewhat remote nature spots so if anyone has some sort of hidden gems in regards to nature based locations that would be cool!

The first three hours were quiet, which was fine by Mal. Sammar stayed silent in the back seat of the wheeler while Mal sipped on his now-cold coffee. They had made it out of Baho‚Äôs core and were navigating up winding roads that cut through the hills surrounding the district.

Mal grumbled as it slowly dawned on him that he was responsible for feeding the child along the way. He looked behind his seat to check on the boy, hoping to find him sleeping. His hackles rose when he saw two large black eyes staring back at him.

‚ÄúYou hungry?‚Äù Mal asked, not wanting to know the answer.

After a few moments of silence, Mal turned back again. ‚ÄúCan you speak?‚Äù

Sammar nodded.

‚ÄúI asked if you were hungry. Did you hear?‚Äù

Sammar nodded again.

‚ÄúAre you?‚Äù

Sammar shook his head.

‚ÄúThen say it,‚Äù Mal snapped. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sit there like a brick. Cog me?‚Äù

Sammar started to nod ‚Äì

‚ÄúSay it!‚Äô

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù shouted Sammar, his voice trembling. ‚ÄúI mean no. I‚Äôm not hungry.‚Äù

Mal grunted, satisfied. He knew it was important to set rules with children. He supposed he was on the right path with Sammar.

‚ÄúMister,‚Äù squeaked the small voice from the back seat. ‚ÄúI need to pee.‚Äù

///

Mal pushed on after sunset until they arrived at The Loop. Situated at the boundary between Baho and EastSec Districts, The Loop was a bustling, hectic depot where the patrons knew to mind their own business. Mal figured he and Sammar could eat and rest while the wheeler recharged without fear of unwanted conversations.

Mal ordered two cholla cactus stews at the counter. Sammar wrinkled his nose when Mal handed him his steaming bowl but knew better than to protest. He followed Mal toward the back of the cantina to the end of a bench table. Mal set his bowl down in front of a young man already seated there.

The man looked up at Mal. ‚ÄúThis is my seat,‚Äù he said

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ours now. Skut.‚Äù

Mal stared at the young man. He was younger, maybe ten kilograms lighter than Mal and definitely more fit. Most likely a transporter on break between hauls. Mal could sense he was confident in his ability to defend himself. But this was the best seat in the cantina with a view of the entrance, and Mal only sat where he could see who came and went.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, shabs.‚Äù The transporter slowly stood, ready to defend his territory.

Mal opened his jacket to reveal the stunstick holstered to his belt. He was more interested in eating than in testing his long-dormant fighting skills. The transporter looked at Mal with a mixture of annoyance and pity before picking up his drink and moving to another table.

Mal hunched over his bowl as he shoveled chunks of the indiscernible fodder into his mouth while Sammar silently picked small nuts from his meal. Mal spotted a thin man in a dusty hooded wrap rush through the front entrance. He pulled down his hood and whistled loudly to get the crowd‚Äôs attention.

‚ÄúA burner lit up Dolvac Heights!‚Äù

The cantina was immediately engulfed in shouts and murmurs as debates broke out over details of the rumored attack.

‚ÄúBoot up the sig, Martel!‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see it!‚Äù

‚ÄúQuit yer yabbin‚Äô,‚Äù barked Martel, the beefy cantina keeper. ‚ÄúLast thing I need is the Consortium Authority up in my biz again.‚Äù

When the chorus of demanding patrons only grew louder, Martel had no choice but to switch on the wall-mounted monitor behind the bar. One of the kitchen workers quickly booted up the receiver and downloaded a clip off the darksig.

Mal got up and jostled his way through the crowd quickly forming in front of the monitor. The screen blinked to life. Pixelated static flashed before cutting to the image from a surveillance drone hovering above a multi-level plaza inside Avalon Protectorate.

A verdant rain garden occupied the central space, surrounded by seven levels of shops and offices. The colorful holo-signs and the bright pigments of the pedestrians‚Äô clothes burst across the battered screen. Everything looked so vivid inside Avalon compared to the brown, gray, grime that covered the world outside. To the cantina patrons it was like viewing footage from a different planet; only a tiny percentage of skids from the outer districts surrounding Avalon Protectorate had ever walked the unpolluted streets and breathed the filtered air inside.

On the monitor, a man wearing the yellow jumpsuit of a cleaner began to stagger, crashing into others. He leaned over, as if trying to catch his breath, then lurched upright, arms outstretched, mouth hanging open in silent agony.

Beams of crackling energy began to burst through his skin as pedestrians scattered. An instant later his body transformed into pure crackling energy, exploding across the plaza. The camera glimpsed people disintegrating and structures crumbling before the explosion engulfed the drone and the screen cut to black.

‚ÄúFrom our ashes, glory.‚Äù said a voice from within the crowd.

‚ÄúFrom our ashes,‚Äù others replied in hushed tones.

The cantina remained silent as the significance of the attack sank in. Every few months a burner from one of the insurgent factions detonated. Most were sent on suicide runs against CCDF military targets, but on occasion a burner would make it inside Avalon.

‚ÄúWhich faction claimed it?‚Äù asked Mal.

‚ÄúNone yet,‚Äù said a small bent man wearing a hood. ‚ÄúMy bet‚Äôs with Phoenix Brigade.‚Äù

‚ÄúGuarantee it was Sixth Column,‚Äù said a large woman missing a hand.

‚ÄúWhoever it was, torching Dolvac Heights means the Authority is gonna rain fire on all skids.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey send their drones, thugs, tanks to wreck us on the daily. Nothing new.‚Äù

‚ÄúFour years since the last burner attack inside the Protectorate! They‚Äôll fear us once more!‚Äù

Mal continued to stare at the empty screen after Martel switched it off. It was the first time he‚Äôd witnessed the moment a burner detonated. He wondered if that was what it looked like when his father detonated inside Avalon thirty-five years ago.

He sighed in resentment as he remembered the boy. Not the best idea to have left him alone in a place like this, Mal realized. As the crowd dispersed and he made his way back to their bench, he glimpsed a woman in flowing robes quickly moving away from the table. The way she hurried toward the exit made Mal suspicious. Sammar was still in his seat, watching after the woman.

‚ÄúThat woman,‚Äù Mal barked at the boy. ‚ÄúDid she say something to you?‚Äù

Sammar jumped in his seat. ‚ÄúShe ‚Äì she snapped a pic. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy tag.‚Äù Sammar lifted his hand to show Mal the digits tattooed onto his palm, as if Mal wouldn‚Äôt believe him.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move.‚Äù

Mal charged toward the exit, shoving patrons out of his way. He burst through the front door, scanned up and down the narrow street for a sign of the woman. Only one lamp lit the block, casting long deep shadows on the numerous figures walking by. None of the silhouettes looked like the woman.

Inside the cantina, Sammar waited, too afraid to even turn his head, staring at his still-full bowl of stew. He started when Mal grabbed his arm.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he said.

  I was staying at the Brookdale Lodge in the hills of Santa Cruz. I was on a vacation and visiting friends in the area. The Brookdale Lodge I learned has a colorful past and is known the be haunted. I was standing outside the Lodge having a cup of coffee early morning and was noticing the stained glass was in need of repair badly. Being a stained glass artist it was upsetting that the windows were damaged and in serious need of repair. As I was looking through the glass I noticed that I was looking into the dining room area and that it has a creek that runs through when a little girl appeared inside the restaurant. She was maybe about 7 maybe and she was running around the restaurant. She noticed me looking into and ran up to the window. She smiled and waved, I smiled back and waved. Then off she went and I really didn‚Äôt think anything about it until it was check out time. I told the clerk that there a child running in the restaurant. She looked at me and asked if I saw her and I explained what had happened. She told me of a little girl that drowned in the creek in the restaurant years before. And that I saw a ghost.

We‚Äôve been together for a while, and our relationship is strong, but there‚Äôs this guy (27M) who‚Äôs been causing some tension. For context, all three of us are gay men.

Before I was officially with my partner, this other guy tried dating me. He was really intense‚Äîtravelling back to my city weekly to set up dates without asking if I was free, sending me constant pictures of himself, and asking for many in return. I found him a bit much but thought he was harmless. I was upfront with him about not being able to meet his emotional needs, and he backed off. We stayed friendly, meeting occasionally for coffee.

When my partner and I first started seeing each other but weren‚Äôt yet official, this guy asked me for my partner‚Äôs number (to ‚Äúwish him a happy birthday‚Äù) but then sent him a message that quickly turned sexual, even suggesting they hook up. My partner, taking advantage of us not being official, asked if I‚Äôd be okay with it. I was super uncomfortable but felt pressured to say yes because I didn‚Äôt want to lose him. That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep and told him the next day that if this was what he wanted, we should end things.

My partner later came back, saying he wanted to commit to a relationship with me and move past the ambiguity. Since then, things have been amazing‚Äîhe‚Äôs attentive, we make decisions together, and we‚Äôve grown stronger as a couple.

The issue is this other guy didn‚Äôt disappear. He moved to our city, apologised for crossing a boundary, and asked to stay friends. I agreed, but his behaviour hasn‚Äôt been great. He‚Äôs been overly flirty with me in front of my partner and makes inappropriate references to our past sexual encounters in group settings. He frequently messages my partner, inviting him to spend time alone. While on holiday together, this guy (and someone he was seeing) joined us and took photos of our activities. Since then, his only contact with me has been sending unflattering photos of myself, asking if he can post them on social media (I always decline).

He‚Äôs the kind of person who likes to be the centre of attention, ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù with every gay man in the city. Two friends have even told me, unprompted, that they think there‚Äôs something off about him and described him as sociopathic.

Recently, I expressed to my partner that I‚Äôm uncomfortable with them meeting at each other‚Äôs homes. I trust my partner, but I don‚Äôt trust this guy‚Äôs intentions and worry he might push boundaries. My partner eventually agreed but asked why it‚Äôs necessary if I trust him. I explained that it‚Äôs not about him‚Äîit‚Äôs about feeling uneasy with this other guy and protecting our relationship.

Here‚Äôs where it gets tricky: I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this guy is calculated, and part of me wants him to find out about the boundary, just to validate my concerns. I also feel like it would prove to my partner that I can predict his moves‚Äîbecause I strongly suspect any suggestion to meet at home would come from this guy, not my partner.

Good morning, friends! Hope you‚Äôre enjoying your coffee because today‚Äôs Bitcoin price action has been nothing short of intense. Let‚Äôs break it down.

üìâ What Just Happened?
	‚Ä¢	A sudden drop in BTC price was triggered by a market sell-off of ~900 BTC.

	‚Ä¢	The order book reacted instantly, with major buy support at $85,000 absorbing the sell-off.

	‚Ä¢	Currently, $85,000 has the largest buy wall (~1,500 BTC), and it‚Äôs constantly refreshing ‚Äì likely managed by algo traders and fundamental buyers.

üìä Key Order Book Zones & Market Trend

üîπ Support at $85,000 ‚Äì strong defense level, keeping BTC in a new range of $85,000 ‚Äì $86,000.

üîπ Sell wall at $86,000 ‚Äì this could slow any immediate upside move, leading to further accumulation.

üîπ Liquidity target at $89,000 ‚Äì yesterday, we failed to reach it, but it remains a key target. BTC might push higher to sweep this level.

üìà Trend & Market Outlook

	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin remains bullish despite this shakeout.
	‚Ä¢	The price action is still inside an ascending channel, meaning the broader trend has not broken.
	‚Ä¢	Sharp liquidations like today are normal in an uptrend, as they are often orchestrated by market makers before the next move up.

üöÄ Conclusion: The Uptrend is Intact!

üî∏ BTC is still bullish.

üî∏ Watch $85K support and $86K resistance ‚Äì a break above could push us towards $89K.

üî∏ Trade smart, stay patient, and let liquidity guide the way.

1jfpxz7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jfpxz7,Willow Leaf Crotton,"Figured with all the interest in mangrove plants recently I'd share my wife's Crotton update. 

Due to the placement of her tank being rather high (on top of our coffee station), she opted for a bendable-necked lamp so we're not blinded by it whilst on the couch; resulting in a rather interesting-looking bend of the crotton in around 7 months since adding it. The newer sprigs are at a 40-45¬∞ angle. 

Definitely going to invest in a tank-length light and do a DIY fixture to block it from our eyes. ",1,1742480267.0,Aquariums,1,1.0,False

I didn‚Äôt sleep well at all last night. Because there were no single rooms left, I had to book a 6-bed dorm, and my roommates rolled in from partying around 4 am. I left the hostel so early that all the doors were still locked, forcing me to find an unofficial way out. My day started with good coffee and croissants at a bakery before hitting the road again.

Kosovo is surrounded by mountains, but the landscape itself is surprisingly flat, so I made good progress. After half a day, I arrived in Prizren - the last town before the climb to Checkpoint 3. As soon as the ascent began, the traffic calmed down, and I could really enjoy the ride. The gradient was manageable and the parcours has been the smoothest so far. Of course, there was some gravel again, but nothing too serious.

At the checkpoint, I bumped into plenty of familiar faces. The atmosphere was nice, and I took the chance to sit down for a huge plate of pasta - one of the few hot meals I‚Äôd had during the race. After the checkpoint, there was another pass to climb before I reached the border to Macedonia. The border guard tells me that I'm too late. At first I think that the border has already closed. Then he has to laugh and says that 80 riders have already got through before me and that I should hurry up. It's certainly not the first time he's made that joke. 

The direct route to my hotel in Skopje was on a banned road I couldn‚Äôt use, so once again, I found myself off-road, navigating gravel tracks through the Macedonian wilderness. The trail was badly washed out and tough to ride, but I‚Äôd learned by now that pushing the bike for a few meters is often quicker than risking a mechanical issue or a crash.

I arrived in Skopje around 11 pm and went straight to my accommodation. I proudly told my host that I planned to set off again at 3 am and said goodbye in advance. But things didn‚Äôt quite go as planned.

1jfpw91,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1jfpw91/whats_the_happy_medium_between_bitterboring/,"What's the happy medium between bitter/boring coffee, and way too sugary lattes?","I'm just starting to get into the world of coffee. And I'm still trying to get ""MY drink"" down.. As the title says, I don't love the bitterness or boringness of coffee (plain or with creamer. Unless it's a tasty sweet/flavored creamer. I like just that hint of coffee taste to tie everything together). 

I like the more ""fun"" & tasty drinks. But i like mild sugar, and it seems that every coffee place (be it the big chains or the little local shops) puts a massive amount of sugar in their lattes! 

Anyone else out there who just likes some nice smooth & comforting flavors, without being too sweet or overpowering? What do you typically order? ",1,1742480133.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,1.0,False
