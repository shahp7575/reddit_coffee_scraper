This fanfic contains bits of lore that may conflict with canon. Such as the depiction of Dominion Angels, Mortals/Winners being able to become Exorcists, and Guardian Angels as a role/job. These additions are based on mine and my friends' OCs.

I plan on writing more for my friends' entertainment but if you guys enjoy it too, I'll post them when they're done.

# Chapter 1: Novi Angeli

Two angels sat in Sera's office, having tea with the Seraphim in question.

The first angel was Mori, a cherub that resembled a domestic silk moth with small feathered wings instead of the ones you would expect and a gold ring for a halo.   
Today she was wearing her ivory-white blouse and a charcoal-black skirt; only her fanciest attire for tea with the head seraphim. Due to her height, she sat awkwardly on a stack of books in order to reach the table and held the comparably large cup with both hands to drink.

The second angel was Aris, a Dominion. She greatly resembled a human with her pale-beige skin, short golden-blonde hair that curled upwards and golden-yellow eyes. Of course, like any angel, she had a pair of wings but hers were a brilliant yellow that shimmered like golden mirrors. Her halo was a glowing light band, shaped like a tiara that held an orb of light like a crown jewel; a miniature sun perched atop her head. She was as tall as any Human; taller than Mori but still dwarfed by Sera. She was wearing her usual attire, a long marble-white dress and a white blouse she wore underneath with elbow-length sleeves, all trimmed with gold.

After a brief moment, Aris placed down her teacup and finally broke the silence. ""Not that this isn't pleasant, but I have noticed that these invites for tea usually also involve some bad news for my department.""

Sera blinked with confusion written all over her face, ""They do? I had no idea. Well, in this case, it's good news.""  
Aris's eyes glimmered at this plot twist as Sera continued, ""Due to the Princess of Hell's treaty with Heaven, we no longer require as many Exorcists and have begun reassigning them to various jobs and departments; including yours. It's good news because you’ve been complaining about being understaffed for so long and now I can finally help fix that.""

The glimmer in Aris's eyes immediately disappeared before she asked with a slight fearful tremor in her voice, ""You're assigning Exorcists… as Guardian Angels?""

""Yes"" Sera chimed excitedly, ""Emily believes that we can rehabilitate them for other roles that don't involve...""

""Slaughtering?""

""...violent tendencies."" Sera retorted, “now, they will be properly assigned to your department in three days. As manager of your department, you'll be in charge of their orientation and helping them integrate, but I'm sure you already figured that out.”

Aris went to interject but held herself back as there was no debating it, it was already done, and paperwork in heaven moved slower than tectonic plates. She put on a smile as bright as the sun “Very well, Miss Sera, we'll get on that as soon as possible\~”

“But I haven't finished my tea,” interrupted Mori, the adorable little moth would stare up at Aris, causing the Dominion to backtrack.  
“We'll get on that as soon as we finish our tea.” Sera covered her mouth as she chuckled, these two were always amusing together.

After tea, Aris and Mori left Sera's office and began making their way back to work. As the pair walked, Aris plucked the orb off of her head as it transformed into a notepad, “Mori, do you have a pen?”  
Mori proceeded to reach into her fluff and pull out a pencil, Aris didn't care much for the difference and began writing and muttering, “Alright, so Exorcists were made to defend Heaven and reduce Hell's population because it was getting too crowded. They're all women and last I heard, before Abel, they were led by his father, Adam.”  
Aris looked at the list she had written before glancing over at Mori, who was fluttering beside her, “is there anything I'm missing?”  
Mori added, “I heard Adam gave them all names based on stuff he liked.”

“Aww, that's kind of sweet, do you think one of them is called Eve?”

“Maybe.”

The two would eventually enter a tall building. Aris and Mori would enter the elevator and step off onto a quiet office floor where angels worked at desks and walked around with papers. Aris and Mori would walk silently until they reached Aris's personal office.  
Inside was a modest desk and chair with a bulky computer that looked straight out of the 1990s and a tower of paper placed in the ‘in’ tray, her work piled up quickly while she was out. Beside it, was a notably smaller desk and chair with a nameplate that read ‘Mori Bombyx’, Mori's desk was here because of the simple fact that Mori is Aris's assistant. Before this, Mori had tried many jobs but could never seem to focus until she started working for Aris. Aris has no idea why this is but there have been theories circulating around Heaven.

On the wall behind Aris's desk was a whiteboard with an assortment of coloured markers, which the pair proceeded to use to plan out ‘Orientation Day’ as they wrote up points to bring up about the job and the expectations with the occasional drawing from Mori to spruce up the very professional plan.

Hours of writing and rewriting later, the two sat on Aris's desk to back up and admire their hard work with Aris being the first to comment, “I love the flower you drew next to the dress code info.”

“Thanks boss. Ooh, we should get them all name tags, so everyone in the office gets to know them better.”

“That's a great idea, Mori! I’ll see if I can get a list of who we’re getting, from Sera, tomorrow.”

—

The next day, Aris came into the office expecting Sera to have gotten back to her about the list of names. The last thing she expected was to see Emily's beaming smile when the elevator doors opened, “Aris!”

“Emily?”

Before she could continue asking while she was here, Aris was already pulled into an air-depriving hug by the young seraphim.  
Mori, who was waiting with Emily, quickly distracted her by showing Emily a cat video on a nearby computer, allowing Aris to recover. She was unsure she even needed air but she never planned on finding out. “So, Emily, what are you doing here?”

“Hmm?” she'd look up from the video of a cat playing on a keyboard, “Oh right! I'm here to give you the list you wanted from Sera.”

“Oh, okay well can I-”

“But\~ remembering how quiet and boring this place is from the last time I was here, I thought I'd brighten your day up too!”

“You really don't nee-”

Regardless of any objections, Emily began breaking out into a song so catchy that everyone in the office eventually joined in, including Aris and Mori. About three and a half minutes later, Aris had the list in hand and Emily disappeared behind the closing elevator doors. Aris commented, out of breath, “I can't believe we sang a song about handing over two pieces of paper.”

“I know, it was great!” Mori exclaimed, Emily's enthusiasm having clearly rubbed off on her.

Aris let her have that as she began looking at the list. Thi- this had to be a joke, right?  
Aris took the stairs to quickly catch up with Emily, double-checking that this was the list she had asked for. Emily simply responded with “Yep, Sera gave it to me herself.”

Aris looked back down at the list, noting names like Clitorissa, Boobella and Va’Gina. Was the First Man really this perverse to have named all of these fierce warriors after female body parts?!

Aris reluctantly thanked Emily for the clarification before going into her office. She sat down and took deep breaths, holding her face in her hands as she glanced down at the list with dread.  
Mori would come in with a pair of mugs, placing one on Aris's desk; as divine beings, neither Aris nor Mori needed coffee but one of the Winners eventually got them to try it and they got hooked on the stuff, “thanks Mori.”

Mori eventually reads the list out of curiosity and the two start discussing what to do now with Aris bringing up a great point, “we could always forgo the name tags.”

“But they look very similar, people will get confused.”

“True…maybe we can give them nicknames?”

“What if they don't like them? Or what if we can't think of one?”

“I… I don't know, the only normal sounding one is ‘Moroni’ and she has an asterisk (\*) near her name…wait, what *does* that asterisk mean?”  
Aris’s eyes scrolled down the page until she found the corresponding asterisk in the footer ‘\* = Winner'  
“Moroni is a mortal?!”

“What are they doing on the list then?”

“I don't know but the name sounds familiar. Can you search for them, Mori?”

“On it!”

Aris went back through the list, looking for any other mortals she might've missed on her initial read-through but found none. Why was this ‘Moroni’ character so special?

A minute later, Mori would pipe up after pulling out the heavenly equivalent of a laptop out of her desk and searching as requested, “I got something: Moroni Nephi. Human, male, born and died in the eleventh century. He's got a permanent record.”

“In heaven? How does that even work?”

“Don't know, Boss, but it says he managed to get to Earth and created Mormonism as a prank. He was going to be sent to Hell but Adam vouched for him because, and I quote, ‘it was fucking hilarious’.”

“Knowing Adam's tastes after reading that list, I can see that happening now.”

“He was eventually brought into the Extermination squads as a sub-commander under Adam.”  
Mori tried to scroll further down but it was blank, “that's it.”

“This morning literally cannot get any weirder after this.” Aris spun on her office chair, roominating on everything when her orb of light involuntary turned into a lightbulb, “Ooh, blank ‘Hi, my name is’ name tags! We hand them out and let each Exorcist decide what they want to be called!”

“That's actually a really good idea, Boss. Do you want me to order them?”

“Yes please. I've got to sort out arrangements for the conference room. You just know Deerie has probably booked it on the day we need it.”

Mori agreed as she left the small office, “that does sound like her”. Aris would be left alone in the office, a step away from quiet as the fluorescent light buzzed above her. She got on her computer, typing up an email to building management to check if the conference room was free, getting a reply almost instantly…that it wasn't.  
And, just like she predicted, Deerie had reserved it.   
In the several millennia that Aris had existed, no one had come close to frustrating Aris more than Deerie. She had no idea why but every conversation with her made Aris want to commit the sin of wrath every time. And yet, she must endure and go talk to her, as she never answered emails.

Aris got up and left her office, immediately b-lining for the elevator and pressing a button to go up this time, ending up on the floor of ‘C.H.E.R.U.B.’.  
Aris stepped out into what could be described as a reception area, complete with waiting room seats and receptionist playing Solitaire, not even on a computer, she was literally playing it with a deck of cards where everyone could see.  
Aris approached and simply stated her intentions, “I'd like to speak with Deerie, I need to discuss usage of the conference room.”  
The receptionist would look up, she was a lion cherub wearing a simple ash-grey three-piece suit and a black bow tie with a blank expression that screamed ‘the brightest knife in the crayon box’. She pushed a button on the intercom, “Uhh, Ms Deerie, someone called…” she'd take her claw off the button, “what was your name again?”

“Aris”

The receptionist pressed the intercom again, “…Aris, is here to see you.”

The intercom would come to life in the familiar voice of a certain deer cherub, “Aris? Oh, of course, let her through\~”

The receptionist buzzed Aris through the door and into C.H.E.R.U.B.’s office. In comparison, this office was much more chaotic and noisy with dozens of cherubs flying around. As far as Aris could tell, the closest they had to an organizational system was simply putting everything in alphabetical order. But there's a reason that C.H.E.R.U.B. is still a big competitor and that was two things: their advertising here in Heaven, and the ruthlessness of their Regional Manager, Deerie.  
Entering her office, it was immaculately clean, especially compared to the chaotic mess of files in the room outside. Deerie was sitting in a chair, much bigger than it needed to be, reading a newspaper when Aris broke the silence, “I need the conference room in a day from now.”

Without even looking up from her paper, Deerie chimed in, “I don't know, we really need it.”

“What if we played a game?”

Deerie doesn't say anything for a moment before lowering the paper to lock her gaze with Aris, “go on\~”

“Poker. You bet the conference room for a day and I'll bet…being your butler for a day.”

“Deal\~”

The two proceeded to set up a game of Poker, instead of chips they had to use peppermint candies as that's all Deerie had and after a few rounds of constantly exchanging chips, this was it! Aris had a straight flush; literally the second-best hand in the game. Aris's confidence skyrocketed and a cocky smile formed across her face and she pushed all her candy into the pot, “All. In\~”

Deerie looked at her cards, her face read like a statue until she matched Aris’s bet and put everything on the line too.

Aris declared her victory as she displayed her straight flush…only for her soul to leave her body as Deerie revealed her royal flush. Literally the only hand that could beat hers.

With that absolute defeat, Aris fell to the floor in shame.

Deerie, meanwhile, unwrapped one of the peppermint candies and offered, “you know, if you double it to being a butler for *two* days, I guess I could let you use the conference room.”

Aris's head immediately flicked up like it was spring loaded, tears had started to form in her eyes, “really?\~”

“Of course\~”

“Deal!”

And, just like that, Aris returned to her own department never to mention how she ‘convinced’ Deerie to give up the conference room. The next day was uneventful compared to the last two, unless you count someone getting covered in printer ink from a printer exploding as exciting.

—

The day after, however, was *the* day. Aris and Mori awaited patiently from the new arrivals. Aris held a clipboard with notes written in her smallest handwriting in order to fit as much information per page as she could. Mori on the other hand, was mindlessly spinning on a cherub-sized office chair beside a small foldout table with blank name tags.

Aris would glance at a clock that ticked away in the room before looking over at Mori, “You're completely sure you made a sign to come to the second floor, right?”

“Of course, Boss.”

Before any more worries could be worried about, the doors opened and almost two dozen similarly looking female angels entered the room, Exorcists and the mysterious Moroni who stood out like a sore thumb, even with his similar uniform.

Besides his halo and wings, he pretty much looked like a normal human. His hair was white, short and slicked back. His face was clean-shaven except for a black pencil-thin mustache that a cartoon villain would like to twirl, and while Exorcist eyes were closer to Falcons or Eagles, his were more like snake eyes; scanning for weak prey to strangle and watch as their life left their body.

Aris waited for everyone to be seated until it was clear that Moroni preferred to be leaning against a wall. With that established, she began, “Hello and welcome to your first day as…”  
Aris quickly flicks her orb into the middle of the room. It begins projecting behind Aris as she continues, “...Guardian Angels!\~”  
The projected image is of a bunch of angels holding hands with a bunch of humans, all looking like they were drawn by a child. Speaking of, Mori blows a kazoo as part of this big dramatic part, a second late.

Aris, noticing that none of them are reacting positively, decides to continue with the rest of the presentation; it goes on for another hour as Aris and Mori explain what it means to be a Guardian Angel and how it helps the mortal world. The orientation ends with Aris adding “if you have any questions, feel free to ask them as you pick up a name tag and write whatever you want to be called on it!\~”

All the Exorcists took a name tag and either wrote their name or some kind of nickname for themselves before leaving without any questions, that is until Moroni came up, “I don't need a name tag, I won't be here long.”

Aris looked confused, “what do you mean?”

“Simply put, this peace won't last, someone's going to fuck up and we'll all be back, doing what we're good at: killing demons.”

“That's not very optimistic of you Moroni.”

“I'm a realist, *girl*.”

He proceeded to leave the name tag on the table as he walked away. Completely not knowing why, Aris felt extra offended the way he called her ‘girl’.  
Mori then distracted the dominion when she pulled on her sleeve, “can I have the name tag if he's not going to use it?”

“Uh, sure?”

“Thanks, Boss”

Mori snatches it off of the table, writing her name in all capitals before proudly pinning it onto her top. The two of them took the stairs as it was clear the elevator was going to be full with two dozen angels trying to use it.  
The pair spent the rest of the day helping exorcists, like Ella and Clitorissa, acclimate to their new tasks.

By the end of the day, Aris was in her office by herself as she looked over some reports. A knock on the door broke her focus as Ella the exorcist peered inside, spotting Aris. She stood tall with her back straightened and wings tightly tucked behind her, “Ma'am, permission to speak?”

“Gr- Granted?”

“Is there any way I could be reassigned to be a proper guardian angel? Paperwork is…not my strong suit.”

“Ahh, I'm glad you actually brought that up, because I was going to recommend you for field training. If you're up for it, you'll be starting tomorrow.”

“Thank you, Ma'am.”

She was about to leave but Aris quickly spoke up, “Ella?”

“Yes, Ma'am?”

“You can just call me Aris.”

“I- uh… Very well… Aris.”

Ella would close the door, leaving Aris with a soft smile on her face as she enjoyed the fact that this ‘exorcist rehabilitation’ thing might just be possible. She proceeded to get distracted and even roped Mori in, when she showed up, on what an Exorcist would be called once they were no longer an exorcist. The consensus reached between the two of them was ‘Vigil’.

UBC is an incredible place, but it can mess with your head if you’re not careful. You’re surrounded by smart people, loud achievers, LinkedIn resumes in human form, and it’s easy to think everyone else has it figured out. They don’t. Most people are just better at hiding the uncertainty.

Academics:

Your grades matter but not as much as you think. What matters more is whether you’re actually learning how to think, how to struggle, and how to recover when you mess up. One bad midterm, one failed course, one delayed graduation does not define your intelligence or your future. The people who win long-term are the ones who don’t quit when things get uncomfortable.

Life & personal goals:

You don’t need your whole life planned at 20, 22, or even 25. It’s okay to pivot. It’s okay to realize the path you chose isn’t for you. The only real failure is staying stuck out of fear of starting over. Measure progress in consistency, not speed.

Relationships:

Choose people who make you calmer, not more anxious. If someone only shows up when it’s convenient or makes you feel small, that’s your answer. Romantic or platonic,mutual respect matters more than chemistry. And don’t chase validation. The right people won’t make you beg to be chosen.

Health (physical & mental):

Sleep is not optional. Neither is movement. Neither is eating properly. You cannot grind your way out of burnout. If your mind feels foggy or heavy, that’s not weakness, it’s a signal. Talk to someone. Use campus resources. Ask for help before you hit rock bottom. Strength is taking care of yourself early, not suffering silently.

Mental health & confidence:

Confidence isn’t loud. It’s quiet self-trust built by keeping promises to yourself. Do the small things you said you’d do. Go to class. Finish the assignment. Go for the walk. Confidence comes after action, not before it. And please stop comparing your behind-the-scenes to someone else’s highlight reel.

Something people don’t talk about enough:

You are allowed to enjoy your life now. Not “after midterms,” not “after graduation,” not “once I make it.” Laugh. Go for coffee. Watch the sunset from campus. Call your parents. These years are stressful, but they’re also fleeting.

If no one’s told you this lately: you’re doing better than you think. Keep showing up. Keep being honest with yourself. Keep going, even when it’s slow.

And if you’re struggling quietly this isn’t the end of your story. It’s just a hard chapter.

Wishing you clarity, health, and a little more self-kindness this year.

You’ve got this.

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

To analyze our 2025 spending, I looked back our purchase history on Amazon from 2009 to 2024. **This is not the entirety of what we purchased during those years**, but it's a reminder of how we got sucked into the system and contributed to their wealth for all those years... It's kind of convenient that a big bulk of our purchase history is in one place, but Amazon doesn't list the total spending in a way that makes you aware of how much you are spending, so you'd have to do the math.

**2009-2012**

1-3 items a year, all electronics ($50-500/yr) like laptop battery, hard drive, sewing machine, music gear

**2013-2017**

electronics ($100/yr), gift ($100/yr), household ($200-250/yr)

**2018-2021**

electronics ($50-750/yr), gift ($150/yr), household ($250-400/yr), shoes($100/yr)

**2022-2024**

gift ($150/yr), household ($570-900/yr), shoes/bag ($60/yr)

* Household - laundry detergent, dish soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, shampoo, light bulbs, moisturizer, sunscreen, face wash, a few kinds of serums, supplements, water/air filters, tea, sponges, mitts, thermometer, pitcher, knives, pillows, bedding, massage balls, yoga mat, lens cleaner, printer toner, etc.
* Gifts - books, nuts and baby shower items of their choice
* Electronics - computer parts, hard drive, sewing machine, modem, wifi, SD cards, projector, shredder, vacuum, humidifier, air purifier

**Reflections**

* Our first Amazon purchases were electronics and we continued to buy those things from them. We still use everything we bought aside from a few things that broke and couldn‘t repair (humidifier, music gear bag).
* Amazon spending increased when I got their 3% cash back credit card (no fee) in 2018 (canceled in 2024). We never paid for Prime but that often prompted us to add not-immediately-necessary and unnecessary items to make it qualify for a free shipping. We always used up everything so it's not that we bought too much of unnecessary stuff, but we ended up buying lots of household items from them out of habit and convenience.
* Some waste of money - milk frother, silk slip dress, red light bulb, soap lift pads, wonderwash, eye cream (just didn't work out or end up using)
* Less electronic purchases in recent years - maybe we have accumulated enough things that we finally don't feel like needing to buy much more.

**2025**

For ""home"" related purchases (which are ""household"" and ""electronics"" categories combined), we spent about $400 less compared to 2024 ($1800 to $1400). We sometimes buy detergent, soap, etc. at a grocery store and I don’t bother to separate them when we log our purchases (it all goes under ""grocery""), so it's a little off.

* 9 items from manufacturer's websites ($24 filters to $355 turntable after a few repairs on the used one, total $737)
* 2 items on Facebook marketplace ($30 coffee table we refurbished, $20 electric kettle which broke and ended up buying a new one)
* Vitacost, CVS, iHerb, All Star Health, Target for various household stuff (supplements, toothpaste, detergent, soap etc.) 

""Gift"" ($130)  - baby shower items from non-Amazon websites

**2026** 

* Switch to paper-packaged items as much as we can (bar soap for face, body, dishes, powder detergent, citric acid, sodium carbonate cleaners, no plastic wrapped produce and pantry items) once we use up our refill stocks. Hopefully it will cost us less. 
* Figure out when/what to buy new vs used.
* Develop a good system so that I don't spend too much time thinking about it!

1q0rtup,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1q0rtup/something_told_me_not_to_leave_my_apartment_i/,Something Told Me Not to Leave My Apartment. I Should Have Listened.,"I didn't go to work that day. Not because I was sick, or for the simple act of playing hooky; no, it was something else. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't. My doom sense was tingling. It might sound silly, but let me explain.

Growing up, my mother would occasionally have days that she would refuse to leave the house. If asked, she would tell you that something bad was going to happen if she got dressed and walked out the door, even if it was just to get the mail. That was her doom sense, a deep seated feeling in the pit of her stomach that portended some unseen calamity just beyond the boundary of the walls. As a kid, I would laugh at the ridiculousness of the idea; Mom's off her rocker today, she thinks she's going to die if she touches grass. It was easy to shrug it off because it was just one of many superstitions in a cup that was practically overflowing on the table, staining the carpet with a million little idioms and axioms. Many of them, I'm sure you are familiar with; don't step on cracks, always toss a pinch of salt over your shoulder should a single renegade grain miss the plate and land on the counter, never pick up a penny that sits tails side up. So many absurd rules, so many rituals to observe, it's a wonder she got anything done at all. But above all else, one rule was to be followed no matter what; when your doom sense starts tingling, you must obey. Like a lot of lessons that can only be learned the hard way, it was funny until it wasn't; sometimes I think I'm lucky that I was ever able to laugh again.

But, I don't like to dwell on that. Life goes on, and it's easy to write off the things that happen to a child as exaggerated, or entirely mythologized. When you're eleven, everything is big, and the world is always ending. It's hard to distinguish random chance from preordained fate. As an adult, I would tell myself that I didn't believe in such flights of fantasy. The loudest voice in my head was always quick to rationalize; sometimes, bad things just happen, and there's nothing to blame but happenstance. I think I always knew that was bullshit. I didn't go to work that day, or any day after, because I knew that something terrible was waiting for me. Destiny, fate, fantasy, whatever name makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, I know it for what it was; the truth.

My alarm went off at 6:45 am just like it always did, and I got out of bed with the same sleep inertia that rested on my shoulders since the day I turned 30. I didn't know it then, but to be fair, I barely knew my name before the first stream of hot water hit my back as I took my morning shower. No, I got all the way through the grooming process, past a cup of Kroger coffee and a plate of scrambled eggs, all the way to the moment my hand touched the doorknob when it hit me. Only hit isn't the right word. Really, it is more akin to having your body filled with ice cold water. A sharp chill runs down your spine, as your stomach clenches and drops, and your feet feel as though they weigh a thousand pounds each. Were there goosebumps? Maybe, it was hard to tell for sure on top of everything else. The world had stopped around me, as something in my mind let out a panicked hiss.

DON'T.

I tried to shake the thought and turn the knob anyway

STOP.

My stomach dropped a second time and my hand froze in place.

WRONG. SOMETHING IS WRONG.

Before I knew what I was doing, I had backed down the hallway into my kitchen. The rational voice in my head was already making a fuss.

“What the fuck are you doing? You're going to be late for work, and for what? A random bout of anxiety?”

Maybe it was right, maybe I was just having a moment, but it was one hell of a moment to be sure. I buried that rational voice that screamed of write ups and lost wages and walked back to the coffee maker. I told myself that another cup of coffee was exactly what I needed, and then I would hit the road. As I pulled the pot from its cradle, I was alarmed to see my hands were shaking. The great knot in my stomach had loosened a bit, but my nerves must have still been a little frayed. I poured another cup, sprinkling the counter with little drops of java as the pot writhed in my hand. I promised to clean those up when I got home, when I didn't have somewhere to be.

Those drops are still there as I write this. After slamming my second cup of coffee, the shakes simmered down into a dull tremble. I looked at the clock on my stove, and saw that it read 8:30. I couldn't remember if the clock was two minutes fast or two minutes slow, but it hardly mattered; with traffic, I was going to be late regardless. The rational voice piped back up just then, striking the tone of a disappointed mother, chastising me for my silliness.

“What are you waiting for now? Time to get going, idiot.”

It was right again. I set the cup down and headed back to the door, determined to get to the office for my daily 200 bucks. My hand touched the knob and that weight settled back into my body, but I was expecting it this time. Before my body could shut down again, I forced my way through the door and into the hallway of the complex, feeling sweat prickle the back of my neck as the cold air of the AC wafted over me. The heaviness was starting to return to my feet, but I was resolved to keep going.

“Stop thinking about it, and go!”

I jogged down the hallway to the elevator, and jabbed a finger at the button. The chime had been broken for months, but the down arrow flashed its usual faded yellow glow. So far, so good. A moment later, the doors parted in with a rusty groan and a dull thud, revealing the smudged stainless walls and outdated carpet of the elevator. I put one foot over the threshold when another wave of anxiety washed over me.

TURN AROUND. GO HOME NOW.

“Don't be stupid, get in the elevator!”

Conflicting voices now, fighting for dominance. It felt like a war in my brain, but all I was trying to do was go to work! I wasn't disarming a bomb, or deciding if someone should be pulled off life support; this was stupid. So, against the wishes of my body, I stepped into the elevator and rode it from the 4th floor down to the first, and I crossed the lobby with a brisk pace, ignoring the monsoon churning in my gut. When I reached the double glass doors of the complex and peered out into the wider world outside, I saw… nothing, nothing at all.

The early morning traffic started and stopped in a steady rhythm, and passersby continued to pass on by. Birds fluttered down the street, oblivious to the wide eyed man gawking at them through an inch thick pane of glass. Everything was completely and utterly normal. I let out a nervous chuckle, and wiped my brow with the backside of my hand. Man, I thought, I really worked myself up for nothing.

“Yeah, I've been saying that the whole time, asshole, now get moving.""

“Hey man, are you alright?” The voice came from behind me, at the front desk. I turned my head a little too quickly to see the desk clerk, Paul, leaning forward with a look of concern set across his brow. I must have walked right by him without noticing when I was forcing my way through the lobby. “You've been standing at the door for like five minutes, and pardon my cliches, but you look like you've seen a ghost.” He wiggled his fingers as he said the word “ghost,” as if to reinforce the spookiness.

I shook my head and let out another chuckle. I liked Paul. For a glorified doorman, he was surprisingly warm and perceptive. I shrugged and shoved my hands in my pocket.

“Shit, sorry. Just having a weird morning is all.” I paused for a second, and then added; “must have been that second cup of coffee giving me the jitters.”

Paul let out a hearty “ha” and leaned back in his chair. “Well then, I need whatever you're drinking, because I'm on my third cup and it's not doing shit!” He produced a paper coffee cup from the desk and shook it lightly. “Not much excitement here to keep me awake. Heck, you're the most interesting thing I've seen all morning.”

We both laughed at that, and it felt good. It was good. We shot the shit for a few more minutes, before I wished him a good shift and turned back to leave. I was feeling a little better after the exchange. The rational voice chided me for stalling, but I took it in stride. With rationality within my grasp once again, I took a shallow breath and pulled against the stainless steel handles of the doors, letting the cold early morning breeze cascade across my face and chill the standing sweat from my absurd little panic attack. My hands were shaking again, and my insides were still at war with each other, but for a second, I felt good about my decision. No flights of fantasy, no giving in to those unreasonable fears. I was not my mother, and if I had a say in it, I never would be. I threw Paul one last wave, and pushed through.

I stepped out onto the sidewalk, hearing the whoosh of air as the door closed behind me, set against a symphony of idling engines sitting impatiently at the red light. From somewhere in the distance, an ambulance siren was echoing off the buildings. I was outside, and now I just had to round the corner to the lot where my Corolla was parked, no doubt covered in a layer of snow. I turned to walk, cursing myself for not remembering to put the wipers up before the snow came. Ten steps down the sidewalk, the siren was much closer, and I could see the lights of the ambulance down the street. I had time to wonder how it was going to get past the gridlock on my street. I paused to watch it approach, the knot in my stomach twisted yet again, and the feeling of cold water spread through my limbs.

DOOM.

A loud screech cut through the air as the ambulance barreled down the south side of the street, heading straight for the standstill traffic. The driver was trying to slam on the brakes to no avail. The salt trucks had not yet been to my neighborhood, and the road was thick with ice and slush. Even with his foot to the floor, the driver could do nothing to stop what was coming; the vehicle meant for saving lives was about to become an instrument for taking them. As I watched, the ambulance closed the distance at what I would guess was 50 miles per hour, gaining yards every time I blinked. I stood there and stared with a dawning horror of what was about to happen. My stomach dropped into my feet.

“What the fuck are you waiting for? RUN!”

The ambulance swung over the center line and plowed between two sedans at the back of the traffic jam with loud, mechanical crunch, sending both cars careening towards the sidewalk. A red Ford Focus on the opposite side of the street hit the curb hard and flipped on its side, crushing a man against a wall before he even had time to scream. All at once, the weight in my feet let go, and I was sprinting towards the door of my building. The ambulance hit the next set of cars; one of them was halfway into the next lane and the unstoppable force crushed the driver side and sent the car spinning into the next car in the line. The screaming had started by then, a cacophony of fear and agony set against the sickening crack of metal on metal. The carnage was quickly catching up to me, and I tried to tell myself that I couldn't hear the faint wet squelching under each impact. I was lying.

I got to the doors and ripped them open, practically diving into the lobby as the ambulance reached the point I would have been standing. Paul was standing at the window, looking out in horror at the situation. He saw me run in and turned to yell something, but I just kept moving.

“What the fuck is going…” He never got a chance to finish that sentence. A man in an SUV was attempting to escape the chaos, and had backed halfway onto the sidewalk when the ambulance smashed through his fender, thrusting the SUV into the southern window of my building. The glass shattered instantly, spraying my back with little pieces of shrapnel. As I reached the elevator, the back half of the SUV was now resting where the sitting area normally was, and Paul was wedged somewhere underneath. In a panic, I pushed the call button what must have been a hundred times, as I looked across the ruined lobby to the hell that was unfolding outside. At the front of the intersection, a dump truck idled away in the left lane. The ambulance, now looking more like a white and red hunk of scrap metal, found its final resting place in the back of that dump truck. The impact boomed like a strike of lightning landed feet away. The elevator doors opened behind me just as I watched the ambulance driver crashed through the windshield and break his neck on the steel wall of the truck in front of him. The force of the blow pushed the dump truck into the intersection, where more terrible crunches followed.

There is a weird zen that comes with being in shock. In the movies, when something bad happens and someone goes into shock, you don't really get a chance to know what that person is actually feeling. As it turns out, it's almost sort of pleasant. I was in shock when I stepped into the elevator, and the sounds of screaming and glass and metal faded away as the doors slid shut, replaced by the dulcet tones of elevator music. To this day, I can’t tell you if the music was coming from the elevator or my own head. I was faintly aware of a stinging sensation in the back of my neck, but beyond that, the lights were on and nobody was home. The time between getting in the elevator and finding myself curled in a ball on my bed is mostly lost to me. I only came back to earth when my phone started buzzing in my pocket. I pulled it out and answered without looking, the motions just happening automatically.

“Hello?” The voice that came out of my mouth felt foreign to me; it was flat and hollow in the way a hypnotized child would speak.

“Jason, it’s Mark. It’s going on 10 o’clock, and I don’t see you at your desk. Your time card shows that you haven’t clocked in either. Are you coming in today? Because if you’re not, you really needed to let me know beforehand. Our attendance policy is very clear; minimum two hours notice for any call off, no exception. I don’t want to write you up, but…”

Of course it was Mark, Mr. By-The-Book, always crossing his T’s and dotting his I’s, quoting the employee handbook like scripture. I never liked the guy, and I liked him even less at this moment. I sort of tuned out while he was talking, missing the last few things he said. I could hear the sound of an approaching helicopter, when a thought occurred to me.

“Did he say 10 o’clock? Has it really been that long?”

Even the rational voice was incredulous. Mark was still talking, something about points and discipline, when I found a point to interject.

“There…there was a terrible accident. Right outside my apartment…I…I almost…” I absentmindedly fumbled for the TV remote and turned the TV on my dresser to the Channel 2 News, and immediately saw an ariel view of my street, complete with all the carnage below. “Turn on the news Mark. Channel 2.”

“Jason, I don’t see how this has…”

I hung up on him mid sentence and turned my attention to the TV screen, marvelling at the level of destruction that I was almost a part of. The aerial view of the scene cut away to a news reporter on the street, who was doing her best to be professional despite the horrorshow before her, and mostly succeeding. I turned the volume all the way up, and walked over to the window that overlooked the street, pulling the curtains open as I listened for the grizzly details.

“First responders are on the scene now, working to free those that are trapped in their cars. Officers at the scene are unsure of the exact number of casualties, but the death toll is estimated to be at least 10, with at least a dozen others with serious injuries. In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is your fault, Jason.”

I tore myself away from the terrible scene below, and nearly screamed when I heard that. I desperately thumbed at the remote, trying to rewind to see if I heard what I thought I had just heard. I found the button and jumped back 30 seconds, feeling the remote grow sweaty in my hand.

“...In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is Paola Greyson.”

I didn’t realize I had been holding my breath,and I let it all out in a massive exhale. I felt stupid, believing the news had talked to me directly. I must have been losing my mind, but who could blame me? I just witnessed the death of god knows how many people, and could have easily died myself if I hadn’t moved when I did. This fact, laid out so bare before me caused my knees to buckle. In the time since, I hadn’t really processed what happened, and all at once, it crashed over me like a tidal wave. I fell into my bed, and started crying. I cried for the man pinned by the red Ford Focus, for the ambulance driver whose last view was the back of the dump truck, for Paul, oh God Paul, who was always so warm and friendly, now cold and dead beneath an SUV not 3 floors down. All of this destruction, all of this unnecessary death, and all of it could have been avoided if…

YOUR FAULT.

No. That wasn’t right. There’s no way it could have been my fault, could it? All I did was try to go to work. There’s nothing I could have done to cause that. It was the ice…the traffic, the ambulance. There was no way for me to stop it, I was just going to… ‘ YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED INSIDE. ‘ “Bullshit. That’s just superstitious bullshit. Even if you stayed inside, all of those people would have died anyway.”

That may have been true, but…

“No buts! Do you hear yourself? You’re starting to sound just like your mother!”

My head was at war with itself once again, with the rational voice desperately vying for control. For the rest of the day, I did my best to actively avoid thinking, to varying degrees of success and failure. Try as I might to keep it out of my mind, flashes of the accident would barrage my senses at regular intervals, bringing up a cavalcade of conflicting emotions. Grief, anger, fear, and guilt. The guilt was the worst of it, because I could explain it no more than I could accept it, yet it was there all the same. It didn’t help that the scene was right outside my windows, and it especially didn’t help that I could hear the tow trucks and ambulances and fire engines. By nine, I was exhausted in every sense of the word. I don’t think I could have cried anymore if I tried; my eyes had become deeply sunk in two very red rings. My neck was sore from the tiny bits of glass that I eventually found and removed with tweezers. I checked the news before I went to bed, and the final number had been tabulated: 12 dead,15 injured, among which were several children. My heart broke all over again as I turned off the TV and settled into blankets and pillows.

“Tomorrow will be better. Tomorrow we can start to put this behind us.”

If only.

My alarm began blaring at 6:45 am on the dot, just as it always did, and when I slammed my hand on the snooze buttons, I immediately became aware of two things; the tense knot in the pit of my stomach, and a panicked whisper at the edge of my mind.

DOOM.

That was how it all started.

I was not my mother, and if I had a say in it, I never would be. I threw Paul one last wave, and pushed through.

I stepped out onto the sidewalk, hearing the whoosh of air as the door closed behind me, set against a symphony of idling engines sitting impatiently at the red light. From somewhere in the distance, an ambulance siren was echoing off the buildings. I was outside, and now I just had to round the corner to the lot where my Corolla was parked, no doubt covered in a layer of snow. I turned to walk, cursing myself for not remembering to put the wipers up before the snow came. Ten steps down the sidewalk, the siren was much closer, and I could see the lights of the ambulance down the street. I had time to wonder how it was going to get past the gridlock on my street. I paused to watch it approach, the knot in my stomach twisted yet again, and the feeling of cold water spread through my limbs.

DOOM.

A loud screech cut through the air as the ambulance barreled down the south side of the street, heading straight for the standstill traffic. The driver was trying to slam on the brakes to no avail. The salt trucks had not yet been to my neighborhood, and the road was thick with ice and slush. Even with his foot to the floor, the driver could do nothing to stop what was coming; the vehicle meant for saving lives was about to become an instrument for taking them. As I watched, the ambulance closed the distance at what I would guess was 50 miles per hour, gaining yards every time I blinked. I stood there and stared with a dawning horror of what was about to happen. My stomach dropped into my feet.

“What the fuck are you waiting for? RUN!”

The ambulance swung over the center line and plowed between two sedans at the back of the traffic jam with loud, mechanical crunch, sending both cars careening towards the sidewalk. A red Ford Focus on the opposite side of the street hit the curb hard and flipped on its side, crushing a man against a wall before he even had time to scream. All at once, the weight in my feet let go, and I was sprinting towards the door of my building. The ambulance hit the next set of cars; one of them was halfway into the next lane and the unstoppable force crushed the driver side and sent the car spinning into the next car in the line. The screaming had started by then, a cacophony of fear and agony set against the sickening crack of metal on metal. The carnage was quickly catching up to me, and I tried to tell myself that I couldn't hear the faint wet squelching under each impact. I was lying.

I got to the doors and ripped them open, practically diving into the lobby as the ambulance reached the point I would have been standing. Paul was standing at the window, looking out in horror at the situation. He saw me run in and turned to yell something, but I just kept moving.

“What the fuck is going…” He never got a chance to finish that sentence. A man in an SUV was attempting to escape the chaos, and had backed halfway onto the sidewalk when the ambulance smashed through his fender, thrusting the SUV into the southern window of my building. The glass shattered instantly, spraying my back with little pieces of shrapnel. As I reached the elevator, the back half of the SUV was now resting where the sitting area normally was, and Paul was wedged somewhere underneath. In a panic, I pushed the call button what must have been a hundred times, as I looked across the ruined lobby to the hell that was unfolding outside. At the front of the intersection, a dump truck idled away in the left lane. The ambulance, now looking more like a white and red hunk of scrap metal, found its final resting place in the back of that dump truck. The impact boomed like a strike of lightning landed feet away. The elevator doors opened behind me just as I watched the ambulance driver crashed through the windshield and break his neck on the steel wall of the truck in front of him. The force of the blow pushed the dump truck into the intersection, where more terrible crunches followed.

There is a weird zen that comes with being in shock. In the movies, when something bad happens and someone goes into shock, you don't really get a chance to know what that person is actually feeling. As it turns out, it's almost sort of pleasant. I was in shock when I stepped into the elevator, and the sounds of screaming and glass and metal faded away as the doors slid shut, replaced by the dulcet tones of elevator music. To this day, I can’t tell you if the music was coming from the elevator or my own head. I was faintly aware of a stinging sensation in the back of my neck, but beyond that, the lights were on and nobody was home. The time between getting in the elevator and finding myself curled in a ball on my bed is mostly lost to me. I only came back to earth when my phone started buzzing in my pocket. I pulled it out and answered without looking, the motions just happening automatically.

“Hello?” The voice that came out of my mouth felt foreign to me; it was flat and hollow in the way a hypnotized child would speak.

“Jason, it’s Mark. It’s going on 10 o’clock, and I don’t see you at your desk. Your time card shows that you haven’t clocked in either. Are you coming in today? Because if you’re not, you really needed to let me know beforehand. Our attendance policy is very clear; minimum two hours notice for any call off, no exception. I don’t want to write you up, but…”

Of course it was Mark, Mr. By-The-Book, always crossing his T’s and dotting his I’s, quoting the employee handbook like scripture. I never liked the guy, and I liked him even less at this moment. I sort of tuned out while he was talking, missing the last few things he said. I could hear the sound of an approaching helicopter, when a thought occurred to me.

“Did he say 10 o’clock? Has it really been that long?”

Even the rational voice was incredulous. Mark was still talking, something about points and discipline, when I found a point to interject.

“There…there was a terrible accident. Right outside my apartment…I…I almost…” I absentmindedly fumbled for the TV remote and turned the TV on my dresser to the Channel 2 News, and immediately saw an ariel view of my street, complete with all the carnage below. “Turn on the news Mark. Channel 2.”

“Jason, I don’t see how this has…”

I hung up on him mid sentence and turned my attention to the TV screen, marvelling at the level of destruction that I was almost a part of. The aerial view of the scene cut away to a news reporter on the street, who was doing her best to be professional despite the horrorshow before her, and mostly succeeding. I turned the volume all the way up, and walked over to the window that overlooked the street, pulling the curtains open as I listened for the grizzly details.

“First responders are on the scene now, working to free those that are trapped in their cars. Officers at the scene are unsure of the exact number of casualties, but the death toll is estimated to be at least 10, with at least a dozen others with serious injuries. In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is your fault, Jason.”

I tore myself away from the terrible scene below, and nearly screamed when I heard that. I desperately thumbed at the remote, trying to rewind to see if I heard what I thought I had just heard. I found the button and jumped back 30 seconds, feeling the remote grow sweaty in my hand.

“...In total, 20 vehicles were involved in this terrible accident, and rescue operations could stretch well into the afternoon. For Channel 2, this is Paola Greyson.”

I didn’t realize I had been holding my breath,and I let it all out in a massive exhale. I felt stupid, believing the news had talked to me directly. I must have been losing my mind, but who could blame me? I just witnessed the death of god knows how many people, and could have easily died myself if I hadn’t moved when I did. This fact, laid out so bare before me caused my knees to buckle. In the time since, I hadn’t really processed what happened, and all at once, it crashed over me like a tidal wave. I fell into my bed, and started crying. I cried for the man pinned by the red Ford Focus, for the ambulance driver whose last view was the back of the dump truck, for Paul, oh God Paul, who was always so warm and friendly, now cold and dead beneath an SUV not 3 floors down. All of this destruction, all of this unnecessary death, and all of it could have been avoided if…

YOUR FAULT.

No. That wasn’t right. There’s no way it could have been my fault, could it? All I did was try to go to work. There’s nothing I could have done to cause that. It was the ice…the traffic, the ambulance. There was no way for me to stop it, I was just going to… ‘ YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED INSIDE. ‘ “Bullshit. That’s just superstitious bullshit. Even if you stayed inside, all of those people would have died anyway.”

That may have been true, but…

“No buts! Do you hear yourself? You’re starting to sound just like your mother!”

My head was at war with itself once again, with the rational voice desperately vying for control. For the rest of the day, I did my best to actively avoid thinking, to varying degrees of success and failure. Try as I might to keep it out of my mind, flashes of the accident would barrage my senses at regular intervals, bringing up a cavalcade of conflicting emotions. Grief, anger, fear, and guilt. The guilt was the worst of it, because I could explain it no more than I could accept it, yet it was there all the same. It didn’t help that the scene was right outside my windows, and it especially didn’t help that I could hear the tow trucks and ambulances and fire engines. By nine, I was exhausted in every sense of the word. I don’t think I could have cried anymore if I tried; my eyes had become deeply sunk in two very red rings. My neck was sore from the tiny bits of glass that I eventually found and removed with tweezers. I checked the news before I went to bed, and the final number had been tabulated: 12 dead,15 injured, among which were several children. My heart broke all over again as I turned off the TV and settled into blankets and pillows.

“Tomorrow will be better. Tomorrow we can start to put this behind us.”

If only.

My alarm began blaring at 6:45 am on the dot, just as it always did, and when I slammed my hand on the snooze buttons, I immediately became aware of two things; the tense knot in the pit of my stomach, and a panicked whisper at the edge of my mind.

DOOM.

That was how it all started.

1q0rs73,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1q0rs73/frustrated_over_an_injury/,Frustrated Over an Injury,"I've been an ER nurse for 10 years. In that 10 years I haven't even really missed much work, maybe for asthma attacks or something, but no pregnancy breaks, no extra long vacations, etc.  Then, on Dec. 1st I fell down my stairs and injured my leg. I was carrying a puppy that I was fostering and it jumped out of my arms and I fell trying to avoid stepping on/injuring the puppy. So I literally summersaulted down 8 stairs and landed on my leg.

I got \*REALLY\* lucky, I realize that. I didn't break any bones, no head injury, etc. I pulled a muscle in my back and bruised the fuck out of my leg.  And my leg injury turned into a giant sq hematoma that is still the size of my fist (and bigger on bad swelling days).

And because of this fucking hematoma I can't work. If I stand for too long my entire leg swells up (even with compression stockings); if I sit with my leg bent for too long I get a lot of pain. I literally have to have my leg straight/flat/elevated for the majority of the day in order to keep the swelling down and pain down.

I've been to the doctor, had imagine. It's just a fucking really inconveniently placed hematoma that is slowly betting better.  But I'm a BORED and frustrated because  my doctor just confirmed that it is not surgical at this point/can't be drained by the surgery team and I have to let it heal slowly.  I've been off work for 31 days and the doctor thinks it might be another month or two before I'll be able to tolerate even 1 12 hour shift, let alone 3 in 1 week.

And today I just want to cry because I literally drove for 40 minutes to pick something up at my workplace, and I had coffee with a friend for 1 hour, and I came home and sitting with my leg dependent/bent for that time caused me more pain then I've had in 2 weeks.  My leg is back elevated, I'm alternating ice packs again, taking pain meds. And it really just hit me I could be stuck at home for the next two months as this fucker slowly heals.

Please, give me advice on things to do that will distract me. Tell me stories of injuries miraculously getting better.  Just ... anything, because right now I just want to cry again because even have pain meds my leg is hurting and I'm feeling lonely and frustrated and upset about how slow this entire process is.

1q0rnni,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderDrones_Fanfics/comments/1q0rnni/murder_drones_aftermath_chapter_6_backroom_deals/,Murder Drones Aftermath Chapter 6: Backroom Deals,"—February 3 2073–

 

The White House.

 

A name long forgotten.

 

What was once the seat of power of the old United States of America sits in either ruins or completely destroyed along with Earth.

 

But if you hear that name today.

 

They are most likely referring to the building in New Washington.

 

The residence and office of the President of the United Galactic States.

 

Its vast halls holds a series of item collections from both modern and “ancient” eras, portraits of recent and old presidents hang in the walls, a butler makes his way to the most infamous room in that building.

 

The Oval Office, the place where the President works.

 

He knocks before coming in.

 

”Mr President, your Heliplane is here”.

 

Sitting at the table was none other than recently elected and even more recently sworn in President Ronald G Drump, the 190th President of the Galactic States.

 

”Thanks Jerry, im coming”.

 

In what could be described as a rough start for his presidency, Ronald had to deal with this “conference” and he hated it, his voters hated it, the New Republicans are a conservative and mostly anti-drone faction, so having a anti-drone republican in office while having a meeting with drones will not sound good to his future re-election campaign, not to mention the stakes in this meeting, the little remaining stability of the United Nations depends on the result of this summit, which is why he shot down an offer to not attend this meeting as a protest.

 

Making his way to the Heliplane landing spot he couldn’t quite shake off this feeling of imminent dread, climbing into the vehicle, he signaled for the pilot to fly, he watched as the capital of the Galactic States slowly disappears as they enter into hyperspace speed.

 

The United Galactic States was one of if not the most powerful autonomous republic within the UN, unlike other factions, they didnt rely in militias, but rather had a professional standing army (though independent in practice from the UN Army), founded shortly after the Great Death 2076 (300th anniversary of the US) the Galactic States was a vision made by those reminiscent of the old American Dream.

 

On practice however, the GS was just a little less unstable than the UN, having its own ideological factions, it was an event of chance of having this conference take place right after a Pro-Drone Democrat left office.

 

As they exited hyperspace, Ronald couldn’t be more fascinated by the beauty of Aerthis, he heard from the 5 Month Plan but seeing it in person was totally different.

 

As they landed in the Heliplane spot and Donald exited the vehicle with an umbrella (due to the planet’s heavy rain) he saw the man himself, Zhou Xenlai.

 

”Mr Secretary! What a surprise to see you here”.

 

”Equally, Mr President”.

 

”Well not to be too cocky, but normally there’s a crowd of people and reporters waiting for me wherever i go”.

 

”We purposely chose a more private landing spot, the people are waiting down there”.

 

Both men looked down from the elevated landing spot into the main entrance, it had a clear pathway into the main landing spot, with red carpets, fences and security guards everywhere, reporters and crowds waited in their designated area, waiting for the “main attraction” of the night.

 

”The Drone Delegation” Ronald frowned.

 

”Indeed, lets just hope everything goes according to plan”.

 

”Who do u think they will send? A whole mission? A single guy? Perhaps their leader? Or maybe just a suicide bomber waiting to screw us up…”

 

”Suicide bombers are highly illegal in Inter-Galactic law”.

 

”Those drones dont follow human laws Mr Secretary…”.

 

”…And quite frankly neither do some of us…”.

 

…

 

”Anyway we should head inside before one of us catches something, right Mr President?”.

 

”Sure thing”.

 

The two men entered the vast metal halls of the building, accompanied not too far behind by their respective bodyguards.

 

”So…forgive me for my lack of formality Mr Zhou but what exactly is your plan?”.

 

”Hopefully get in good terms with them, after all the last thing we need right now is a war”.

 

”And how exactly will you achieve that?”.

 

”Honestly…im not quite sure, we’ll just acknowledge eachother’s existence, hopefully a non-aggression or a friendship treaty, and maybe cede to some of their demands”.

 

”And they will listen to some of our own demands, right?”.

 

”Yes, hence why i choose to invite the other factions, so each one of us can have a voice and a say on this…heh…maybe we could also sort out some of our own differences here”.

 

”You are way too utopic Mr Zhou, but i respect your efforts”.

 

The two men stopped just outside of a door.

 

”Well i supposed im yet to thank you for even showing up Mr Ronald”.

 

Ronald laughed a little and the two men parted their ways as Ronald entered the waiting room.

 

The room itself felt like a “who’s who” game.

 

Pope Benedict XXIV: Head of the Unified Christian Church and Co-Head of State of the Holy State of Abraham. He was praying on the left side of the table.

 

Caliph Muhmmad Al-Jazzir: Head of the Muslim Communities and Co-Head of State with Benedict. He was quietly sipping coffee next to the latter.

 

Johan Nestlin: First Secretary of the Galactic Communist Party operating inside the Socialist League. He was scrolling through his phone.

 

Derrick Charles Jenson: CEO of JcJenson and 44th Great Grandchild of Joseph Charles Jenson. He was frantically pacing around the room.

 

And finally last but not least.

 

Dmitry Kraznov: Leader of the Human Salvation League, staring out the window to the skyline of Aerthis.

 

Ronald quietly took his seat next to Johan.

 

”Johan! Its rare to see you in public, where’s Valiryn? Isn’t he the one that does these public appearances?”.  
  


Johan put down his phone.

 

”Tovarishch Baslin is busy”.

 

”Ok Mr Grumpy…what about you Kraznov? Staring ominously through the window wont change much”.

 

Dmitry kept staring into the streets below, HSL supporters gathered in protest of the summit.

 

”Zhou has no idea what he brought here, if he keeps doing bullshit like these he’s gonna lead us into a second great death”.

 

Ronald walked up to Dmitry.

 

”Wouldnt you agree Ronald?”.

 

Ronald knew Dmitry was right, at least partially, they both hated the drones sure, but the two had completely different views on the solution, and launching humanity into a suicidal war for the sake of revenge was certainly not it for Ronald.

 

”Listen, Dmitry old buddy old pal, besides the ethical problems of genocide against the drones…are you sure we are prepared? I mean…its not like the drones will just sit out and wait till they die”.

 

Dmitry genuinely looked confused “Elaborate”.

 

”What if the drones fight back, what if they fight back enough to make us lose”.

 

Dmitry laughed “Dont worry Ronald, us in the League will make sure that never happens…and even if it does…we’ve got that figured out…”.

 

”…what about that ethical part?”.

 

Dmitry stared Ronald dead in the eye “Do you think the drones asked us this same question a thousand years ago”.

 

Ronald couldn’t answer that.

 

”The Solver didnt see civilian or non-combatants, only enemies”.

 

The vehicle transporting the drone delegation flew by and landed as he spoke.

 

“And neither will I”.

The Heliplane slowly landed on the landing spot, the place was surrounded with reporters recording the occasion along with some protesters. The doors of the vehicle opened and 3 metallic and surprisingly small figures appeared, the first to leave appeared to be the leader of the delegation and according to some sources the Council President of the Provisional Republic of Copper 9, Khan Doorman.

 

He got out of the vehicle alongside 2 other drones, presumed to be either security or other diplomats, Zhou was waiting in the main entrance just up ahead and signaled his team to offer them umbrellas for the drones due to their water sensitivity, to which the drones accepted.

 

”So you must be General Secretary Zhou Xenlai, its a pleasure”. The small drone reaches out his hand to the significally taller human.

 

Their difference of about 15 centimeters made the handshake awkward as hell but Zhou managed the situation good enough to pass a respect vibe.

 

”My pleasure aswell Mr Doorman, shall we go inside, we have a lot to discuss”.

 

Khan agreed and the two entered the building.",1,1767228106.0,MurderDrones_Fanfics,0,1.0,False

All ended badly /weirdly/ made me think im better off alone.

\*first date in February ended with a person asking me to “borrow” $300 to pay their medical bills, after I paid the check.

\*second date in May was a coffee date that was promising, she was 10years older. But when I couldn’t go with her to a concert in Dallas, the next weekend, she ghosted and blocked me. (I was up for Work flex that weekend)

\*third coffee date in June was nice conversation, and we aligned morally, financially and had similar experiences growing up.

Looked forward to a second date, but then was told by chat four hours later there was no “magic” so thanks but no thanks.

\* fourth date in July went well. Nice little brunch and things seemed to go well. Lots of laughs. 15 yrs younger than me, but I thought I could make it work. 

Second date was dinner and drinks and good conversation and I we seemed to be hitting it off.

Two weeks later I get asked if I could send her some money to buy lunch for her and her kids. Venmo or Cash App would be ok……\*sigh\*

\*fifth date in October. Breakfast after matching on FB dating. Visiting antique shops and then dinner at sushi restaurant. Seemed like things were going well. 

Second date, she invites me to lunch at her favorite Mexican restaurant. I made it known before hand that I believe whoever invites, pays. Gets to the restaurant, starts crying that they only have “41 cents in their checking account and they can’t even pay their rent this month.” Me and the waiter are like “what does that have to do with the bill?”

Add to that the frequent catfish / onlyfans/ if you aren’t loving Jesus women that I turn down / block that I keep getting matched with, and I’m just hoping that 2025 ends quietly tonight, so I can be hopeful for 2026.

Thank you letting me breathe all this out. 

May your 2026 be blessed, and may we all get what we want in the new year. ✌️❤️",11,1767228031.0,datingoverfifty,4,0.92,False

1q0rl43,https://www.reddit.com/r/TBIfamilies/comments/1q0rl43/fight_of_a_lifetime/,Fight of a Lifetime,"Wildlife was never a mystery to me. I lived far too much wild life as an adult, and had more experience with critters as a child than most kids outside of Elly May Clampett. I think I’ve mentioned an owl we had for a bit to eliminate our huge rat problem as a child. Opossums, tarantulas, very large snakes, giant turtles, and the occasional stray mama cat to go with the gift my family always had (except one particular girl) to always find our home being shared with some downright brilliant canines. Those animals are fine and enshrined in all of our memories. I could not find an antonym for “enshrined” when looking for a description of the animal that I waged one of the greatest wars in my life against.

Karl and I were living in Heritage Pointe Apartments on Hargrove, across the street from Doc’s Food and Spirits (the scene of some later wild life of mine). Neither of us was very tidy, but Karl was worse. In the previous apartment we rented, I was helping him pack his bedroom when I came across a plate on the floor of old chicken bones that became an ashtray for him that started from one of our first ever nights there, 6 months prior. The rest of the apartment, I could get into shape sometimes, unlike our previous abode. I was walking home from work one night when I passed an empty 50-gallon trash can on some rollers. I snagged that up, and we put it in the big walk-in pantry-closet at the far side of the kitchen. It had rollers, but we were on the 2nd floor, so the trash would very rarely get emptied. It led to a pretty damned big roach supply that I found annoying to various degrees.

I’d be lying in my bed, waiting for sleep, next to my open bedroom door, when I’d see a roach walking down the wall of the hall through the doorway. I’d lie there just hoping he would continue his jaunt on past my line of vision so that I wouldn’t be forced to get up, grab a shoe, and kill him. He’d get almost out of sight, do a circle or two, then head back to the other side of the door before he’d do a circle and go back in his original direction. This was happening one night when I reached over for a swallow of some sweetened tea next to my bed, swallowing a roach that I could then feel flipping and circling somewhere in my gut for a minute. My annoyance turned into something else.

I got up and walked directly to the Kroger for some weapons. Hot Shot was the weapon I chose, and it turned out to be the best gun I’ve ever had. In that old commercial, you’d see someone spray a bug from a good distance, and the bug would explode like a Star Wars TIE fighter. Our visitors didn’t explode, but the Hot Shot fired an accurate stream about 30 feet out. My bedroom door issue would no longer be a problem. The commercial conveyed the proper message.

I took the Hot Shot into the pantry-closet to spray the big can, then started moving things back off of the shelves when I uncovered a very large ball of roaches behind some things. I fired my Hot Shot into the eye of that compact storm, causing it to quickly develop into some sort of hurricane enveloping the entire room, with every roach running for its life. I continued my spray as they covered every wall and the ceiling of the room, falling onto the floor, into the 50-gallon can, and all over me, who had very recently swallowed one and felt it trying to climb back out of me. Things were **on** at that point.

The apartment building we were in was far from nice, and we had an Asian family next door that would barbecue dogs and cats. Mexicans, while generally clean, had moved wholesale into the area and would sleep about 12 to a unit. There was a laundry/ storage facility at the bottom of the lower breezeway stairs that held a few good places for them to congregate, and I sought out every one of them. I’d probably spent two solid weeks scrounging in and around the enclosed building and those around us, looking for more roaches to kill, when I began to miss them from the good old days, when I’d keep a bag of rubber bands on the coffee table for a friend who could twist a band around his fingers like a gun and pop them off of walls from across the living room at will. I never got that good at it.

I’ve had homes that beach crabs liked and homes that had constant gecko life on the walls. I had to keep a good eye out for scorpions when my son was a baby, and had a place that I woke up to with sore fingers until I saw the spiders that lived between the wall and the part of my mattress where my hands would be when sleeping, but nothing wriggled its way down my throat. I never saw a roach in those apartments again. I intend to keep things clean enough not to provide any breeding ground for them. But if I see one, I have already identified some possible bases and I know just the gun I’ll use.

1q0rkot,https://www.reddit.com/r/MM_RomanceBooks/comments/1q0rkot/the_queer_principles_of_kit_webb_by_cat_sebastian/,The Queer Principles of Kit Webb by Cat Sebastian: A charming delight,"Yes, I know, everyone reads and loves Cat Sebastian already so why am I bothering to lavish more praise on her? Well, because I enjoyed this book a lot, and because it somehow didn't feel right to let the year end without drawing attention to it. I think I would give this one 4 stars out of 5, if I put any stock in the star system, but please understand that a 5 for me is ""made my brain melt"" so 4 is still extremely high praise.

{ The Queer Principles of Kit Webb } is set in Georgian era England (1750s) which already gets points from me just by virtue of not being Regency. Nothing wrong with Regency, I just feel like it's a little played out and even a small deviation from it timeline-wise catches my interest. It features a romance between a nobleman (well, sort of... it makes sense in context) and a former highwayman turned coffee shop proprietor. I'm inclined to think that the inclusion of a coffee shop is an intentional wink and nod toward the fandom trope of the coffee shop AU, but with the absolutely charming twist that 18th century coffee shops were centers of intellectual life in urban areas like London. 

The two leads are the titular Kit Webb, recently retired from a life of crime to run a coffee shop that serves a clientele with revolutionary leanings, and Edward Percy (Percy to his friends), a Duke's son who has led a charmed life up until the moment he learned of his illegitimacy. The meet-cute moment occurs when Percy solicits Kit's help in an elaborate plot to destroy his father, the Duke, for which he needs an experienced highwayman. 

Yes, obviously, Kit's gruff exterior hides a heart of gold, and yes, obviously, Percy is kind of a little shit due to his privileged upbringing. That's not exactly groundbreaking material, but it's executed so well that I didn't care and you won't either. Percy is sharper than he looks, and Kit isn't as above-it-all as he likes to think, and it makes for a fun push and pull as they slowly realize they're having fun pulling off their scheme and don't really want it to be over. Given that, it's pretty easy to predict that Percy is going to have a crisis of conscience, and you could say that moment is a LITTLE heavy-handed, but that's partially in character given how Kit is absolutely determined to drill it into Percy's head how bad his dad is. I appreciated it anyway.

One thing I thought was extra fun is Sebastian's commitment to period vibes including dressing Percy in frilly silks, powdered wigs, and lots of makeup. If you catch yourself reading this and thinking it sounds camp or feminine, remember that's the 21st century talking- in a period context that's just how rich men dressed. (Thinking back on this, I feel like there's an entire dissertation to be had in the way powdered wigs and silk stockings get used in 21st century media as marks of villainy and slightly queer-coded villainy at that. Pirates of the Caribbean, King George III as portrayed in Hamilton - am I way off base here? - but if you slide just a few decades forward into the 19th century, suddenly the wigs come off and aristocratic dress is OK for romantic male leads again.)

A CAVEAT FOR AUDIO LISTENERS: >!I started listening to this on audiobook, and made it nearly halfway before giving up on the narrator. Joel Leslie narrates this in a very affected-sounding breathy nasal whine that took me out of the story. It would be fine as a character voice but strikes me as deeply odd when used for the supposedly neutral narration. If that's a dealbreaker for you, read it on the page.!<

Don't be fooled by the pastel cartoon cover: This is solidly genre romance but it doesn't cross the line into twee, IMO. If you like swashbuckling adventure, fun banter, a little bit of a ""Beatrice and Benedick"" dynamic, or if you really want more powdered wigs from your romance media, give this book a try.

1q0riut,https://www.reddit.com/r/12in12/comments/1q0riut/12_categories_of_games_for_2026/,12 Categories of Games for 2026,"Apologies in advance, as I am absolutely doing this challenge wrong (or at least very differently from what I see others doing). But, it just so happens that I am fickle af, so I know deciding on specific titles will go over like a lead balloon for me. I still really like the premise of this subreddit, though, and wanted to use the framework to participate. With that goal in mind, I went through my collection, categorized a lot of the games I want to play this year, and this is the result!

Here are 12 categories I’d like to play at least one game from this year. The options below each category aren’t set in stone. They’re just examples of what I’m thinking of (plus, they’re ones I already own, which I want to prioritize). I’m hoping this makes it feel more manageable, rather than seeing a list of a dozen 50+ hour RPGs and not knowing where to start, haha. If you bother to read through and have any thoughts, feel free to suggest more things I should play based on the categories you see here and the specific titles I’m mentioning.



1. **A popular, cinematic, companion driven RPG that I know I’m going to love.**

This is my favorite type of game, but also takes the longest to play because I squeeze every last second out of them. I spent my teens with KotOR, played two Dragon Age games last year and want to keep chipping away at the pile. 

*Some options: Dragon Age Inquisition, Jade Empire, Kingdoms of Amalur*



1. **A slightly-less-popular, cinematic RPG** 

Kind of a weird distinction, but basically games that aren’t the first ones mentioned when it comes to RPGs, but that are still very companion and story heavy as well as in that cinematic style. 

*Some options: Deus Ex, Greedfall, Mars: War Logs, Nier Replicant, Mass Effect Andromeda)*



1. **A classic JRPG** 

A gorgeously-pixelated, turn-based throwback that came out when I still wasn’t allowed to play video games. Considered a cornerstone or a must-play by many. I played a few like Chrono Trigger and Suikoden this year and I want to keep going with one or two really highly regarded ones. For some reason, I’m hesitant to fully get into JRPGs so I’m sticking to things that are super popular.

*Some options: Suikoden II, Final Fantasy I, Lunar* 



1. **A top-down (?) RPG**

I’m having a hard time explaining this type of game, perhaps because I haven’t actually played one. Think the original Baldur’s Gate instead of Baldur’s Gate 3, or Fallout 1 instead of Fallout 3. Not sure exactly what to *call* those types of games, but hopefully that gets the point across. Essentially, the precursor to the cinematic RPGs I like so much that I hope I’ll enjoy too.

*Some options: Fallout, Baldur’s Gate, Divine Divinity*



1. **A Paper Mario-Like** 

Okay. Last flavor of RPG, I promise. I tried out Born of Bread last year and loved the humor, art style, and gameplay. I heard it compared to Paper Mario and promptly bought everything even remotely similar… but embarrassingly, still haven’t played any of the pile. I want to fix that.

*Some options: Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door, Super Mario RPG, Bug Fables, Outbound Ghost, Billy and the Rainbow Leviathan*  
  


1. **A shooter type thing** 

Not a very commonly played genre for me, but I think I’d really like these particular franchises and I played plenty of Halo at friends’ houses as a teen, so I want to give things like this a try.

*Some options: Halo: Combat Evolved, Bioshock, Borderlands, Half Life*



1. **A detective game**

Back to another one of my best-liked genres: mysteries and detective games. I have so many of these to get through, but I’d like to at least knock out one or two more this year. 

*Some options: Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Mummy, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice for All, Paradise Killer, Frog Detective 1: The Haunted Island*



1. **A visual novel** 

I tried a couple of these last year, and found they often have a bit of overlap with detective or mystery games (like Ace Attorney). Some I tried were South of the Circle, Doki Doki Literature Club, and Yuletide Regicide. Since I enjoyed them well enough, I’d like to keep branching out.

*Some options: Coffee Talk, Danganronpa Decadence, Road 96, Heavy Rain*



1. **A puzzle game or “thinker”**

Another favorite of mine as well, I really enjoy these, not only for the gameplay, but also because they’re usually a nice breather between long games. I played the entire Trine series last year, the entire Professor Layton series, as well as a few smaller titles. 

*Some options: Portal 1, The Stanley Parable, Monument Valley, Carto*



1. **A farming and/or management sim**

This is kind of two categories, but I was running out of space. Plus, they share a fair number of similarities. I love Stardew Valley, gave the original Harvest Moon a try a while back and then dipped my toes into Story of Seasons this year. None of them really did it for me the same way Stardew Valley did (Harvest Moon was the closest), but we’ll see if I can recapture that magic. 

*Some options: Little-Known Galaxy, Echoes of Plum Grove, Harvestella, Bear and Breakfast, Cat Cafe Manager*



1. **Middle-Aged-Man Street Cred** 

Weird category, I know. But I want some middle-aged man street cred, as the title suggests. Just… basic things I should have tried by now/things every middle-aged guy collecting video games on Youtube talks about. But, specifically games I think I’d actually like from said list.

*Some options: Earthbound/Mother, Zelda, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Diablo*



1.  **A stealth game** 

Finally, there are stealth games. I played Assassin’s Creed Odyssey when it came out, squeezed every last drop out of it, then went on to Black Flag and eventually Valhalla. I’d like to try starting from the beginning before I try any more of the newer, open world stuff, and would also like to try other games with stealth mechanics I think I’d enjoy. 

*Some options: Assassin’s Creed I, Hitman: Codename 47, Dishonored, Thief*

I kid you not... the bottle was sealed and everything but when I go to open it, it tastes just like coffee. 

The first time this happened to me I had just finished having a really pungent cheese and so when I drink it, I just assumed that this cheese combo plus feel free equal coffee flavor and I didn't think much of it but yesterday I bought two bottles and I got a wiff of them before I drank them and they were 100% coffee. The crazy thing is that the bottle was sealed as in, it was hard to open and it doesn't look like it had been tampered with. That said it was 100% coffee no doubt. I showed it to my friend and then I showed it to the gas station clerk and then we dumped it out next to an actual bottle and the difference was night and day.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

My youngest cousin was raised Mormon, and has been slowly distancing herself from the religion in the last year or two. She no longer attends church She identifies as Christian but not necessarily Mormon. 

She has been an interesting mix of quite sheltered, and quite rebellious. She currently lives at home. Now in her early 20s, she’s old enough for me to have her come visit me as an adult! I’m in my mid 30s and was raised agnostic. 

She has expressed interest in trades school but her father has been deeply disapproving of her and her sister pursuing any sort of education. So I am going to take her on some tours of campuses here and talk to some program advisors to give her an idea of what’s possible. 

This is her first time ever travelling farther than a few hours drive from her home town. 

I’m out of my depth, any suggestions of activities, things to avoid… she likes video games and tattoos? She drinks coffee? 

I want to show her the world outside of the community she grew up in, and just expose her to possibilities.

1q0ram1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_-olivaceous-/comments/1q0ram1/ill_pay_for_your_dry_cleaning/,I'll pay for your dry cleaning,"I'm a chauvinist, you told me in passing. Yes, I was warned about your views before I started working for you and your equally 'traditional' partner. The men in my family taught me the language your type speaks; I'm fluent in antiquated bullshit. I know when to tune you out and when to put you on blast.

Another time, you asked, with a hint of glee and notable pride, whether the two of you ever made me cry. You made all your assistants cry, you offered. I asked if bringing women to tears made you feel like men and left the room.

Short hair isn't feminine, you said. An oblique insult that might have been aimed at me, courtesy of a person whose face was donated to him by Picasso. Catty? Perhaps, but also true, well-earned, and much, much kinder than the way I'd normally describe you. Your mug doesn't turn heads, it repels.

On more than one occasion, drool hanging from your chin in a long, ropy strand, you thought nothing of making some comment, to me, your assistant, about the summer student you described as a tall drink of water. You were old enough to be her father and she was barely out of high school. I had your wife on hold, by the way.

Speaking of wives, when a colleague's wife came to visit with their newborn, you delighted in asking me if I saw *the gut on her*. You thought it was okay to shame a women for her humanity. For bearing the marks of pregnancy. It took everything to keep me from asking what your wife's gut looked like. You too, had a newborn, but your queen's similar postpartum *gut* was spared your judgment and derision. How would you have reacted if a colleague asked the same about *your wife*?

Years later, no longer in your employ - thank fuck! - you had the balls to say hi to me at a club when I was talking to a mutual acquaintance. You got my dead-eyed glare as a response, and I had the joy of watching you slink away like the rat that lost a battle to dine on a days' old, half-eaten slice of pizza, seasoned with the mélange of detritus, motor oil and piss that decorated the alley it was dragged through.

Why the fuck would would you expect me to greet you with anything other than contempt and hostility, after you shamelessly did everything in your power to break me the last two years I worked for you?

On top of what you did publicly, I knew what you and your buddy did behind the scenes to try and make my work days unbearable, because you documented it in emails I had access to. Did you forget that part?

And despite the expression you misread and described as 'a deer in headlights' in those emails, I was never afraid of you. Your attempts at cruelty were preschool level compared to what I survived long before I knew your names. Bitch - and that's exactly what you are - you didn't have the types of weapons, or ammo, it takes to wound me.

I still remember the gross slob who came to the office in stained shirts with frayed collars and holes at the elbows, enhanced by ties with loose thread tentacles that had been dipped in a variety of past meals' sauces. Badly scuffed shoes that hadn't seen a shine in ages, made for a nice finishing touch.

You're a mediocre nobody who rode his business partner's coattails after the hottest firm in town recruited him for *his* achievements - **not yours.** You didn't have any, as I recall. He generously offered to take us along for the ride. The offer was made to *him,* and he was gonna go, with, or without us. We both know you weren't on their radar; you weren't even on the radar of middling firms.

You'd never be where you are today if it wasn't for him. You've forgotten that - I haven't and I can't, especially after you both pulled a Vance-you-didn't-say-thank-you. I never took my good fortune for granted and you know it, but you expected me to humiliate myself and thank you for your open hostility and abuses? Fuck that action. I wasn't going to grovel and indulge your inflated egos.

I don't begrudge you your successes, nor will I describe you as anything other than intelligent, because you are. We both happened to be at the right place, at the right time, when your partner was recruited. I never lost sight of that; you felt entitled to an opportunity you didn't earn and continue to preen like a peacock because of it.

You now rock bespoke Italian suits and wipe your ass with cashmere, but you're still the person who called me a cunt after you bumped into me and ended up wearing my coffee. Accidentally. On purpose. Jackson Pollock style.

The only cunt here is you. It's always been you.",1,1767226933.0,u_-olivaceous-,0,1.0,False

1q0r9h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q0r9h1/the_internal_clock/,The Internal Clock,"I’ve worked as a security guard at a local museum for over a decade. It’s a quiet job, mostly walking through cold galleries filled with statues and ancient artifacts that don't talk back. I like the night shift because the world outside feels distant, like a dream I don't have to participate in.

Two weeks ago, my supervisor told me that we were receiving a new exhibit in the basement storage. It wasn't a statue or a painting. It was a grandfather clock, crafted from a dark, oily wood that seemed to absorb the light from my flashlight.

""Don't wind it,"" the supervisor warned me. ""The collector who donated it said the mechanism is delicate.""

I ignored the clock for the first few nights. But on the fourth night, I heard a sound coming from the storage room. It wasn't a tick; it was a heartbeat. Slow, heavy, and wet.

I opened the door and found my colleague—the man who handles the morning shift—standing in front of the clock. He was staring at the pendulum. He didn't turn around when I entered.

""Do you hear it?"" my colleague whispered. ""It’s not keeping time. It’s counting down.""

""Counting down to what?"" I asked, keeping my distance.

He finally turned to look at me. His face looked hollow, as if the muscles beneath his skin had dissolved. ""To the moment we swap. He’s tired of the wood. He wants the bone.""

The next day, my colleague didn't show up for work. My manager told me he had disappeared, leaving his car running in the parking lot. I was asked to pull a double shift.

As the sun set, the museum grew unnaturally quiet. I was walking through the sculpture hall when I noticed a change. The statues—figures of ancient kings and warriors—weren't facing the center of the room anymore. They were all turned toward the stairs leading to the basement.

I felt a sudden, sharp pain in my chest. Tick.

I gasped and clutched my heart. It didn't feel like a muscle contraction. It felt like a gear turning. I stumbled into the restroom and splashed water on my face. When I looked into the mirror, I saw a small, brass keyhole appearing just beneath my collarbone.

I ran to the exit, but the front door wouldn't budge. I pulled and kicked at the glass, but it felt as solid as a mountain. I looked out into the street, hoping to see a police officer or even a passerby, but the sidewalks were empty. The streetlights were flickering in a rhythmic pattern. Tick. Tick. Tick.

I realized the entire building was changing. The walls were turning into dark, oily wood. The windows were becoming opaque glass.

I retreated to the office, hoping to find a phone, but the desk was gone. In its place stood the clock. But it was taller now. And the pendulum wasn't made of metal anymore. It was a human arm, swinging back and forth, the fingers grazing the floor with every second.

I looked at the face of the clock. There were no numbers. Instead, there were names of places. Kitchen. Park. Library. Bedroom.

The hands were spinning wildly, stopping briefly at each location. Every time the hand landed on a place, I felt a memory being ripped out of my head. I forgot the smell of the café where I buy my coffee. I forgot the color of my mother's eyes. I forgot the layout of my own apartment.

""Please,"" I sobbed, falling to my knees.

The clock door creaked open. Inside, I didn't see gears. I saw my colleague. He was woven into the machinery, his veins acting as wires, his ribs forming the frame. He looked at me with an expression of pure envy.

""Your turn,"" he rasped.

The keyhole in my chest began to turn on its own. I felt my skin hardening, my joints locking into place. I am no longer a man. I am a vessel for seconds.

I am writing this on a scrap of paper I found in the storage room, hoping the cleaner finds it in the morning. But as I look at my hands, they are turning into dark wood. My heart has stopped beating. It only clicks.

I can hear the front door opening. I hear footsteps in the hallway. It’s the manager coming to check on me.

I hope he likes his new watch. Because I’m about to become his entire world.",6,1767226834.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

***May 28th, 2004***

***Friday***

***5:48AM, Viridian Forest***

The pidgey that hunted in Viridian Forest were known to be territorial; most people learned to avoid the birds by the time they were school-aged. Alice made sure to pedal past the flock hastily. She was not in the mood to get attacked.

*Again.*

Shadows circled the path below Alice. Their cries sounded warnings to their prey. Caterpie scattered across the path, and she watched a couple bury themselves in the dirt.

Despite her efforts, a lone pidgey did see her as a foe. Its loud squawks were close behind her; she could feel the gust from its wings.

Pidgey were known to be agile; the best thing she could do was to swerve through the trees and hope she'd lose it. Sand blew in the wind; she squinted her eyes and tried to stay on the path.

Kicking up sand was their go-to method for driving out potential threats.

One would think that after so many years, Alice would've picked up a thing or two about avoiding them. Well... she did learn that pidgey had particularly sharp talons. She measured how deep her cuts were (the deepest was a stinging six millimeters), and she closely tracked its healing process.

Her mom insisted that Alice treat them... but she wanted to see how they'd come out naturally. They were somewhat faded now, only a few standing out on her shoulders. Those were the deepest.

Abandoned spinarak webs stretched across the branches. Dewdrops bound to the silk and glistened in the sun, which allowed Alice to dodge them much easier than pidgey (which she was sure she lost now).

Albeit, spinarak poison wasn't any more fun.

She was careful to stay on the designated path, though. Viridian Forest was nothing but wilderness, and danger lurked even during the day.

The carnivine was one of those dangers Alice had to avoid... their vines allowed them to hang low from trees, and their green, epidermis-like skin camouflaged them with the foliage.

The telltale sign that a carnivine was near was the sickly sweet scent of their agape mouth that patiently waited for prey.

One nearly bit her leg off just a few months ago.

She was so lost in her thoughts, she didn't register the smell. Carnivine weren't even known to be out in the open. The loud crack of a branch and the eerie screech that erupted from its maw were the only warnings she was given. It was enough to make Alice reconsider her Second Star ranking—not because she thought the woods were dangerous.

She knew the woods were dangerous.

Alice probably knew better than anyone else.

She thought back to the carnivine. It was the first time she actually smelled its rumored sweet scent. Most who got close enough to one didn't live to later go into detail. Most stories only came from near-death survivors. Who were, unfortunately for Alice, more concerned with actually living and not so much with the in-betweens of literally anything else.

Whatever, she'd just have to do it herself.

She was always alert in the woods, hoping to catch sight of a rare Pokémon. Sometimes, if she were lucky, Alice would see a herd of pikachu passing by. Like the carnivine, they tended to reside deeper within the woods. Pikachu preferred the company of their own rather than people. Still, they knew the presence of people meant food, and the occasional sighting made Alice wish she had a berry to give.

She stopped suddenly, her bike skidding up dirt.

There was only one thing in Viridian Forest rarer than a pikachu.

*A trainer.*

Pokémon training was a dream Alice abandoned years ago, and she wasn't going to let herself fantasize about it, either.

Still, she watched from between the trees. From what she could tell, it was a male. She wondered what partner Pokémon he had. Would it be weird if she asked?

Alice didn't often see actual Pokémon trainers. There weren't many trainers anymore, and usually they were much older. To become a Pokémon trainer was the real reason why most people aimed for a third star rank.

Whenever Alice did see one, she couldn’t help but stare.

This one looked young, though. A bit older than her... Maybe she would be fine to talk...? She chewed on her lip and loosened her grip on her bike handles.

She averted her gaze when she saw the trainer move.

*Do not be weird!* Alice scolded herself.

She looked anyway.

The male trainer was obscured by foliage, but she could see that his hair was brown. He aimed a pokéball at something in the air.

His stance seemed... familiar.

What'd he get? What Pokémon did he already have? She really wanted to know.

Alice decided that she needed to know.

A nearby tree made a good spot for her to leave her bike, and she walked off the path. The male trainer was becoming more visible to her; she could see his backside. The pokéball he tossed earlier shook and then beamed with light. The Pokémon escaped.

A Pidgey?

It flew around the trainer; its caws rang loudly in Alice's ear.

Was that where the one chasing her went?

He tossed another ball at it, and this time, it stayed.

Just as Alice peered from behind the foliage, she caught a glimpse of his face.

Her whole body froze.

Gary Oak.

Suddenly, everything about her became mechanical, and she aborted mission.

She didn't care about whatever Pokémon he had; Alice decided she actually didn't need to know anything about him. She was perfectly fine with killing her curiosity if it meant keeping her dignity.

Alice was back on her bike.

Gary was a third-star rank. 

Just like her.

She gritted her teeth. 

*He was also actually a Pokémon Trainer.* 

He was achieving her dream.

Alice finally made it out of the forest. She needed to leave behind her grievances about Gary and training. If she were to be honest with herself, it was their dream. At one point, that was all the two of them could talk about together. Alice had nearly forgotten; everything shot into her mind like a flashbang.

It was just a silly childhood dream she had.

*So why was he able to?*

She shook the thought away and locked it in the back of her mind.

Alice had a new dream now, a dream of research. She channeled her drive into her studies and her reports. She was unbearably dedicated to her passions. It was a dream she could realistically work with.

\*\*\*

***6:32AM, Pewter City Museum of Science***

The lobby was still dark, the only light being from the dim hallway.

Shadows cast from the exhibits. They demonstrated all sorts of Pokémon on the first floor. She walked past them; she needed to make sure they were still intact. They required frequent check-ins, and Alice was particular over their care.

Fossilized amber, omanyte, kabutops... they were all over the museum. It wasn't just ancient Pokémon, either. The museum had all things to do with old findings.

Alice followed along the exhibits until she reached the back shelf. It was where the researcher's published documents could be found. Only a few of her works would be found on it; the approval process was a lengthy one.

She was quite proud of her work—even if not all of it was appreciated. 

At least Doctor Blythe respected her enough to consider her work.

The discovery of 'Shiny Pokémon' (as the few online forums she did lurk in called them) wasn't one taken seriously. It was a topic researchers largely discarded, which included Alice.

That was until she had found one.

A shiny Diglett.

Doctor Blythe found her survey interesting enough to have on display for any guest to read.

She was even in the local papers for it.

It's not as respectable, but Alice enjoyed the novelty and recognition.

Alice tore herself away from the shelf before she fell into another daydream.

A clear display caught her attention—the Moonstone display.

Moonstones were the most common in the museum.

The ones that held the most scientific interests were kept in protective glass. A large moonstone had fallen from the sky—long before Alice was born. Or her mom for that matter. Once scientists studied all they could, it was moved to the main floor for the world to see.

It was one of Alice's favorite displays. The simplicity of its scientific advancements was endearing to her. It was also generally pretty to look at. This time of the morning, the reflective twinkles of the meteorite paired nicely with the dimly lit room. It stood out in a way most wouldn't see. 

The rest of the moonstones found were sold at the museum's gift shop; trainers and other Pokémon handlers came often for them.

An image of Gary in the gift shop with a moonstone invaded her mind. Alice cursed herself for not keeping him locked up in her forgotten place.

Mister Callahan's voice rang in Alice's ears, and for once she was glad for the distraction.

She walked down the hall. Mister Callahan's office was just down it, and he usually arrived much earlier than everybody else. His office door wasn't even open, but he had the ability to carry his voice much further than most people.

He sounded angry.

At what?

*Who would know.*

Alice doubted he even knew; his anger seemed to be never-ending.

The files she had been tasked with still sat on her desk from the night before. Sometimes she’d walk into new assignments without any warning, but today there was nothing added.

The museum had a much slower workload than usual. Mt. Moon was under surveillance, and Alice wondered if that was why Callahan was so stressed. She did recall a meeting recently…

She wasn't necessarily meant to be there. But it wasn't her fault; they were the ones who barged in on her.

The filing room was a mess when Alice stepped in. Papers flew from her arms, and she searched for the light switch. The overhead bulb stuttered, then illuminated the room.

The table thudded as she dropped the papers, and she looked around the room, hands on her hips. The place was a complete mess. The filing drawers were open; various folders stuck out. The large table had coffee stains; Alice placed her hand on it.

""Who left this—Mm!"" Alice yelped. She jumped away from the table and held her other hand almost protectively. The texture—*oh Ho-Oh*, she thought she’d vomit—was grippy. The sound was a sensory overload. 

*Sticky* coffee stains... Alice swiftly moved her stack of papers elsewhere.

With a towel and spray bottle in hand, she returned to the table.

When the office lobby got too loud, Alice sometimes moved her work to the filing room. It saved her a trip, and most would forget about her.

It also meant she'd walk into this on occasion.

The filing room doubled as the break room, and not everyone seemed to understand it was a *shared space*. 

It was hardly this bad, though.

With the final cabinet shut, the space was now worthy of Alice’s time.

She stood proudly in the middle of the room.

She'd vacuum the floor if they had one. The floor was still covered in crumbs, and she imagined the feel of tiny, dusty specks all over her. The sensation made her cringe.

The closet door was covered with miscellaneous items, a coat rack, a fold-up table... the likes. There must be one in there. It was a maneuver to get the door open, but she did.

Of course the vacuum was in the far corner; she couldn't just lean over and swipe it up.

*Must be because no one's ever used it.*

She grunted and made it into the closet.

“*Let’s all have a seat and get this done and over with*.”

*Crap!*

The closet door had slowly closed behind her, barely cracked. Alice watched Callahan's larger build stride across the room. He was shorter than most men but taller than Alice and wore a light brown suit. His dark red tie was proudly around his neck.

Doctor Blythe was close behind. His dark hair was slicked back, and he was noticeably older by at least a decade. Four other scientists from the lab joined the table.

The one she just cleaned.

They got comfortable in the office chairs; Callahan leaned back while the rest either sat straight up or leaned towards him.

Getting over that table was a workout on its own, and she'd just... waltz out? *Yeah, no.*

She couldn't just leave.

She'd make a fool of herself; the possibility made her cringe further. The thought of Callahan's quips, the questionable stares.

Stifled laughter.

Alice backed away from the door and sat down.

She'd just have to wait.

Alice couldn't remember much from the meeting; it was a lot of 'word noise,' as she liked to call it. Word salad worked, too, she'd suppose. But salads had some nutrients.

*Noise was just noise.*

And Callahan made lots of them.

Following along with him was difficult. He droned on about junk Alice didn't care for. Wasn't this supposed to be a meeting? What are they even here for, and for how long did she need to stay hidden?

Her mind wandered as he finished the point she understood two minutes ago. The more he spoke, the more it bored her. She'd heard conversations between children that were more entertaining than this.

The museum was toured frequently by schools, and Alice had heard all sorts of childish things.

She found them more interesting. Unlike adults, they were unpredictable. There was no need for social ritual yet; they were honest about every question they'd ask Alice.

Their questions and answers were so simple and heavy; sometimes she found they made more sense. The genuineness was something she missed from being a kid.

Speaking to Callahan felt like every word was a front. Some underlying message beneath each word she was somehow supposed to know.

She didn't feel like a child with Callahan, because that wasn't how children spoke to each other.

She felt like she was acting.

The only meaningful news she got out of being trapped was that Mt. Moon was somehow missing fossils. 

*Whatever that could mean.*

She assumed it meant they had discovered all that they could from the cave.

It was inevitable.

Based on his reactions, Callahan didn't like that.

The idle chatter of incoming staff brought Alice back from her thoughts. Alice sat down quietly at her desk behind the counter and debated if she should move to the filing room.

*Maybe not...*

She hardly got any work done last time.

Then again, with Mt. Moon used up, she could work on her personal reports.

Alice also saw it as an opportunity to push for more research in Viridian Forest.

Though, her efforts were largely ignored.

As soon as the thought came, a stack of paperwork plopped on her desk. She looked up to see Doctor Blythe, the head scientist of the museum's lab.

""I need these by tomorrow, Hart. Callahan's been a tyrant all morning over it.""

So much for keeping her head low.

""But these weren't assigned to—"" she retorted before she could stop herself.

""They are now. You're the only one who's not doing anything important."" His voice cut through her words, and she berated herself.

Alice puffed out her cheeks and flipped through the pile of papers.

*This was going to take ages...*

Doctor Blythe had already crossed the room by the time she looked up.

This is where she would spend the rest of her day. She'd draft up research papers. Then walk to the filing room and back to her desk, where she would then draft up another paper... and back to the filing room.

*At least it's exercise...*

Alice didn't always see the point in all of the research she did. She wasn't allowed to join excavations through Mt. Moon; her reports in Viridian Forest were just straight-up ignored, and none of the other researchers bothered to take her seriously.

She was just a glorified tour guide.

An assistant.

Alice suspected it was her age, but she knew deep down the real reason.

Despite it all, it only fueled her.

Even if it meant dealing with an absurd amount of paperwork.

Alice sighed and picked up the first page.

\*\*\*

***5:00PM, Pewter City Museum of Science***

""Oh my *Mew*, hi Alice!""

Alice winced internally at the sound of the girl's voice.

*Great.*

She had almost forgotten...

Nina's shift brought the possibility of chaos.

For weeks now, a group of boys would sneak—well, more like walk right in—into the museum and wreak havoc. Alice often had to spend most of her shift cleaning up after them and kicking them out.

She didn't recognize them from any of the schools... and they didn't really fit the typical look of most in the area. Alice suspected they were from the other side of Mt. Moon.

""Five o'clock already?"" She muttered. Not that Nina paid attention, anyway. Alice watched as Nina took the seat behind the secretary desk and logged into some online social group. 

Myspace, maybe? Nina had tried to get Alice into it before...but it just wasn't for her.

She never used the internet for anything other than research and basic networking. She's tried out Friendster once... but Alice didn't like it any better. 

Where was Nina even finding these things? Alice couldn't even begin to understand her online obsession.

It wasn't uncommon to find her updating and refreshing her Myspace profile for the millionth time of that day.

That's what she did instead of her job.

The number of times Alice denounced her behavior was innumerable. Her teenage flippancy was something Alice wasn't equipped to handle, either.

And it was maddening.

Everything was fine, though. She needed to remind herself of that.

Everything is fine.

\*\*\*

***9:23PM, Pewter City Museum of Science***

On nights like this, Alice and Nina had a different routine.

Usually, Alice would stand, all prim and all proper, by the touring stand. She would give tours in thirty-minute intervals, come back, and be ready for the next group.

But the museum was slow tonight. When tour groups did arrive, they were small and didn't ask many questions. Which made the tour itself go by much quicker.

So instead, Alice would sneak off to her desk and write up reports. They had to be careful; Callahan insisted that Alice stand at the front of the exhibits, regardless of people. If she were caught, she'd be in for another one of his chastisements.

Besides, she still needed to work on those papers for Doctor Blythe.

""Nina, I'll be in the filing room if you need me.""

Nina threw her a quick thumbs up; she didn’t take her gaze off the screen.

Alice glanced at the entrance of the building one more time.

*Just in case...*

The hallway smelled like smoke. Alice's nose scrunched from it, but admittedly it didn't smell as terrible as it tended to. The yellow tint of the walls was obviously not the original color, and it paired terribly with the green carpeting.

She had brought up to Callahan several times the risks of compromise for certain exhibits. The stains caused by smoke were difficult to get out safely.

Some exhibits even needed special chemicals that were *not* cheap. Alice figured it'd be something he'd actually consider.

Alice thought a lot of things about Callahan, but she did think he was at least proud of where he worked and would want the best.

He didn't want to hear it.

On that day, he walked around all over the museum with a lit cigar. When it ran out, he was quick to light another. All just to prove a point to Alice.

She thought his pride for the museum would overtake his personal pride and was disappointed to learn that wasn't the case.

She swore after that, everything had a yellow tint to it.

All Alice needed to do was to take the papers to the filing room. The sooner she got that done, the sooner she could get on with her night. 

It was further down the hall, just past Callahan's office. The door was always shut, and as long as she was quiet...

*""-reports of the police—""*

Alice stopped in her tracks.

""Do I look like I give a damn ab—"" Callahan's voice boomed through the door. It made Alice jump, and she quickly pressed her back against the wall.

""Mt. Moon is closed now, sir. Even small expeditions aren't possible."" Doctor Blythe's voice followed.

Did she hear that right?

A moment of silence passed. Alice could imagine the look of frustration Callahan no doubt had. It was a look she had been on the receiving end of many times.

She did know the local police had been heavily discouraging expeditions. Only certain areas were allowed to the public, and all activity was prohibited after dark. No one knew why, and it didn’t look like it would let up anytime soon.

""We cannot go on with future research until the police finish their work.""

Another long silence.

She heard him grumble at the notion.

*Great.*

Mt. Moon was now permanently shut until further notice.

Alice pushed herself off the wall.

\*\*\*

***9:38PM, Pewter City Museum of Science***

""Alice,"" Nina motioned at a small group of tourists.

Alice quickly rose from her desk and smoothed out her uniform.

This tour group was significantly smaller than the ones Alice had given all night; to her, this suggested it was almost the 10:00PM closing time.

Alice greeted the group that consisted of older folk; they were really the only age group interested in that sort of thing.

They toured the building, upstairs and downstairs. Few asked any questions, but Alice was happy to just talk about what she loved without interruption.

She forgot how good it felt to just work. To talk to people who cared about what Alice had to say, people who wanted to hear her theories and ask questions. It was the tourist that made her feel like her work meant something.

""Thank you all for visiting today,"" Alice spoke as they reached the entrance once again. Quickly, she glanced at the clock. The time now read 9:58PM, confirming her suspicion.

""The exhibits will reopen tomorrow at 7:00, and we hope to see you again."" Alice smiled and waved politely at the leaving patrons.

Alice leaned back against the door after she shut it, her eyes closed as she replayed the events of the day. That dreadful feeling still hadn't gone away, no matter how much she tried to rationalize it.

Those boys hadn't made an appearance—*yet*. 

Alice wasn't so quick to write them off.

Outwardly, there was nothing wrong. But the muted ambience of the museum made Alice's instincts scream something had to be.

It was just the Mt. Moon talk... there was a new air of stress that lingered in the building. Everyone could feel the energy shift Callahan put off. She wasn't going to let his bad mood get to her.

She wouldn't.

""Alice!""

Nina's voice rang loudly in her ear, and she jumped at its suddenness.

""Yeah?"" She responded after a deep breath.

""You're going to be so proud of me,"" she declared from behind her computer screen. Alice held back the urge to roll her eyes. *For what, doing her job?*

""Oh yeah?"" Alice played along.

""M-mm hmm,"" Nina hummed and shot up from her desk. ""You know those boys that come in all the time?""

Alice's heart dropped, and her hand tightened on the door handle.

*Oh, Ho-Oh...*

""What about them...?"" Alice tread the question carefully; her heart pounded hard against her rib cage. Was there a brown bag anywhere?

""I kicked them out.""

Her panic ceased.

That's certainly not what she expected.

""I didn't even know they were here..."" Alice muttered and pushed herself off the door. ""When?""

Nina pursed her lips and stared off as she seemingly tried to find the answer.

""An hour ago... maybe...?"" Her uncertainty didn't give Alice the greatest peace of mind.

""Oh... well,"" Alice paused. ""Thanks, Nina."" The words felt odd from her, but she meant it.

\*\*\*

***10:21PM, Pewter City Museum of Science***

The unease Alice felt disappeared.

Still, she trusted herself enough to know something had to have been wrong.

But she wasn't going to let herself grow crazy over it, either.

Nina had left a short bit ago, and Alice was one of the few people left behind. The lab still bustled with all the real lab attendants. She was alone in the dimly lit lobby. 

She usually stayed behind just a few minutes longer. There have been more than a few times when Nina had completely forgotten to lock the main doors.

She was a sweet girl, but the equivalent of a magikarp. Alice wasn't even sure how she still had this job.

Maybe that’s why she felt the need to check behind Nina. Anyone else, Alice would let make the mistake. But Nina was stupidly nice to her, even if she sometimes made Alice’s job harder.

The door shut heavily behind her. She pushed back against it and secured the lock.

The dark night welcomed Alice as she made her brief walk to the other side of the building. She had a long way ahead of her, and the sooner she got to her bike, the sooner she could get home.

Alice stopped abruptly when she turned the corner.

The feeling she felt all night suddenly made sense.

""Son of a—"" Alice winced to herself as she kicked the wall that her bike once leaned against.

\*\*\*

***Saturday***

***1:19AM, Pallet Town***

Alice kicked off her shoes; they lay haphazardly on the porch. She knew she'd get an earful from her mom about it, but for now, she didn't care.

It was a miracle she got through the forest.

Not unscathed, though.

No, not at all.

Her legs were covered in new scratches, her hair was a mess, and she couldn't bear the way she smelled. Alice must've walked through a dozen spiderwebs; thankfully, most weren't inhabited.

*Most.*

Though not fun, spinarak poison was manageable. She used its silk to wrap around her arms. It was common to use them as bandages; the healing properties of the web were local knowledge.

Alice's biggest worry was again, the carnivine. She crept around every turn, but the sweet scent never appeared. Eventually, she relaxed. The main path was still relatively safe.

Her head pounded and her clothes stuck to her body—she didn't even want to think about what she looked like. All Alice wanted was the comfort of her bed.

Careful not to wake her mom up, Alice crept quietly through the hallway until she made it to her bedroom. It was the smaller of the two, but she made it work by adding more shelving. The shelves held Alice's countless research journals and surveys. Some were published by more legitimate resources; some were just of her own making.

Maybe it was more than necessary, but it was perfect for Alice.

Which is why she immediately noticed her journals were moved.

Not just any journal.

It was her personal journal. She probably would have written about the night she had in it.

If she wasn't so damn tired.

*Oh, this is just great.*

First her bike, and now—

*Ugh.*

But unlike her bike, Alice knew who had her journal.

# The Goat in the Church



The district judge of Stuhlbrestenburg, Knud Ahlbeck,[\[i\]](#_edn1) had just finished the exciting reading of these two articles in the *Rattenhusen Courier*, took another sip of coffee, and was about to take leave of his wife to go to court when the teacher Flamm was announced to him, with whom he had been friends for almost forty years.  He was shocked at the teacher’s appearance.  Flamm began to weep as soon as he came in and could not utter a word.  Ahlbeck shook his hand sympathetically and asked him to sit down.  Mrs. Ahlbeck poured him a cup of coffee and put a large piece of cake on his plate.  Flamm sat hunched up in the big armchair, chewing and sobbing by turns.

“My head is all in a muddle,” he began at last.  “I have no idea where to begin.  The disaster!  The disgrace!  Just think, after twenty years!  I have been removed from office, thrown out onto the street!  What am I to do?”​

“Yes, what has actually happened, old friend?” asked Ahlbeck.  “I cannot make head or tail of the newspapers.  There is nothing but overwrought twaddle in them.  You were there.  Tell me! What is it all about?”​

But Flamm still could not say anything coherent and only kept crying out again and again, “The disgrace!  The disgrace!”​

“Do tell me at last!” urged Ahlbeck.​

Flamm started to weep again and stammered with difficulty, “I still haven’t really come to myself … I don’t know anything anymore … out of bread! … driven away! … Nobody wants to have anything to do with me … You are the only one who has taken pity on me …”​

“Now, now,” interrupted Ahlbeck, “it cannot be as bad as that.  After all, you have your pension.  And besides, people feel keenly for your fate, you must realize that!”​

“What good is people’s sympathy to me?  They think I am insane.  All those who have fared in these days as I have, they are all taken for madmen.  I have been dismissed.  Here I count as dangerous – I, I, who have spent my whole life forcing youth to discipline, humility, and submission…”​

Flamm grew more and more heated, his whole body trembling with agitation.​

“But God is not mocked,” he went on in a shrill voice.  “The blinded will come to see what they have lost in me.  It is a hellish plot.  Thanks to the softness of my heart and the delicacy of my conscience I let myself be carried away the day before yesterday to that compromising step.  And now – dismissed!  There is something behind all this, Ahlbeck, I tell you, there is something behind it.  What it is, I cannot yet make out, but there is something behind it.  It is not only against me, it is also against you, it is against everyone, it is against the state, religion, morality.  It is a conspiracy, a conspiracy!  And you must help me to uncover it!”​

“But dear Flamm, I do not understand how you can get into such adventurous fantasies,” replied Ahlbeck in astonishment.  “What connection is there between the strange vision you had and this fantastic assumption of a conspiracy?  Since when can conspirators perform magic?  You are overworked, overwrought.  Your nerves have played you a trick.  You will recover.  And we will put the whole affair straight again!”​

Flamm jumped up indignantly.​

“What?” he shouted.  “Overwrought?  Vision?  Nerves?  And how do you explain everything else, eh?  The disappearance of the pupils?  Ranke’s illness?  The business with Clemens Rotbuch?  The open prison doors?  The crowing director?  I will tell you what it is.  It is the beginning of the end, the overthrow, the ruin!  And if no action is taken in time, everything is lost!”​

Ahlbeck looked up, taken aback, and said, “Why, is all that really true?”​

“All of it,” replied Flamm eagerly.  “All of it!  And much more besides!  No one yet has any overview of what has happened in Rattenhusen during the last three days.  People are afraid to talk about their experiences; they do not want to make themselves ridiculous.  Perhaps they also talk themselves into believing that nothing at all has happened, for they have no desire to lose their wits.  And yet it is true!  As true as I stand here!  Ahlbeck, man, brother, the whole thing is coming apart at the seams, the whole thing!”​

At this point Mrs. Ahlbeck joined in the conversation.​

“You see, Knud,” she cried triumphantly, “you see?  Didn’t I say so at once?  But you thought it was all women’s gossip and superstition.  Well, who turns out to be right now?  And my dream from the night before last?  What do you say to that now?”​

“I say that you are to leave me in peace!” shouted Ahlbeck furiously.  “My head is already buzzing.  And then one is supposed to sit all day in judgment, and today of all days, when the big trial is on…  One cannot see through all this in the first excitement.  It needs to be thought over calmly!  And you, Flamm, should not put such foolish words into your mouth as overthrow, end, ruin.  We are a long way from that.  You are alluding to the Undergrounders?  We shall settle them – even if the entire rabble were to join forces with them.  We are the masters!  We have created the culture of this country!  We shall know how to protect it! …  Perhaps there really is a criminal plot behind your affair; perhaps, however, it can also be cleared up in a comparatively harmless way…  Overthrow?  There is no overthrow!  The way people have always lived, that is how they will go on living.  What crazy expressions are these? …  Come now, calm yourself.  I still have an hour before I have to go to court.  We’ll sit down in a little wine‑house and talk everything over quietly together.”​

They set off.  When they came past the half‑open portal of the cathedral, they stopped in surprise.  Music was sounding from within.  A many‑hundred‑voiced choir was singing an exuberantly jubilant song.​

“There you have it again!” said Flamm sourly.  “The new spirit!  The church is being turned into a theater!”​

“How beautifully they are singing,” broke in Ahlbeck, who was a great lover of music.  “I have never heard such beautiful singing.  Shall we listen for a bit?”​

When they entered the church, they noticed that it was full of people.  Apparently the singing had drawn in many passers‑by.  What the occasion of this morning concert was, neither Ahlbeck nor Flamm knew.  Then Ahlbeck caught sight of the first public prosecutor, Johannsen, standing in front of him.  He touched him on the shoulder.  Johannsen turned and whispered in surprise, “What?  You here as well?  What is going on?  I had heard nothing of any church celebration being announced for today.  I heard singing outside, came in and…”​

“Then you are in the same position as I am; what on earth does it mean?” Ahlbeck whispered back.​

“Just listen,” said Johannsen, “what sort of music that is!  Those are certainly not hymns!  A little worldly, aren’t they?  And yet it seems that a service is to be held: the altar candles are burning.”​

The song that resounded through the church from the organ loft passed over into an ever more fiery tempo, rose rebelliously and excitingly to furious lust and issued in a passionate dance tune.  A spell seemed to lie on the listeners.  They appeared to have forgotten where they were.  Their faces glowed as if with fever.  They were breathing heavily.  From time to time some of them uttered groaning sounds that sounded like stifled lascivious laughter.  Now and again there seemed to run a jolt through their bodies.  Their limbs began to twitch in rhythm.​

The singing grew ever more monstrous.  Drumbeats were already mingling with the tones.  Furious violin passages hissed up.  Blasts of trumpets drove them on to ever more breathless frenzy.  And when the organ, too, began to thunder from the depths, people could no longer control themselves.  Out of their senses, they fell into one another’s arms and began to dance, stamping and shouting.  Flamm, Ahlbeck, and Johannsen hopped like goats and, together with some market‑women, wove a clumsy round dance. 

Ahlbeck bellowed over and over a booming “Ho‑hopp! Ho‑hopp!”

Johannsen called into the midst in a command voice, “Changez les dames!  Changez les dames!”

And Flamm whimpered between tearful laughter, “The ruin!  The downfall!  Hurrah!  Hurrah!  Hurrah!  For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever!  Amen.” And he leapt higher and higher on his thin legs.​

With a mighty hallelujah the music came to an end.  At that very moment the aged Consistorial Councilor Pistorius [\[ii\]](#_edn2) was seen to mount the pulpit in full vestments.  All fell suddenly silent.  Then Flamm gripped the district judge convulsively by the arm and croaked, “There they are again!  There they are again!”​

“Who? What?” asked the judge, looking around in all directions.​

“The eyes!  The eyes of the pupil!  The consistorial councilor!  He is here!  He means to get at me!  For God’s sake, what shall I do?  Where shall I hide?  Help!  Mercy!  Mercy!”  He sank to his knees and whimpered.  Those around them fell into confusion.  One after another they knelt down in fear.  The agitation spread ever farther.  And within a few minutes everyone was on their knees, moaning with wrung hands, “Mercy! Mercy!”​

From the pulpit there came loud, unending laughter.  The full red face of the consistorial councilor grew narrower and whiter.  His small black eyes had widened and taken on a rigid gray gleam.  For a moment he looked like a half‑grown boy.  But this sight, too, changed, and there on the pulpit stood a snow‑white goat, its shaggy forelegs planted on the reading desk, and bleated in a high‑pitched penetrating voice.​

The congregation did not know what to do.  Cold sweat broke out on them.  They struck their foreheads on the floor and gasped out their “Mercy! Mercy!” 

Johannsen stammered again and again with white lips, “Quousque tandem, Catilina? Quousque tandem, Catilina!” [\[iii\]](#_edn3)

Ahlbeck’s face turned red.  He stretched out his arms and shouted in a voice of thunder over the others’ heads, “Hold out!  Hold out!”  But nobody listened to him.  Ever sharper, more piercing, more imploring sounded their cries for mercy.​

Only Flamm now stood there, his face distorted with rage, his fists clenched.  He had recovered himself.  His cutting voice rose above the lamentation: “Thus speaks the prophet: Woe to the filthy, polluted, tyrannical city.  She will not obey, nor receive correction.  How desolate she is become, that the beasts dwell in her!  And whoever passes by her whistles at her and claps his hands over her!”​

Thus he ranted for minutes on end, staring up at heaven with white eyes in a frenzy of inspiration.  But from the organ loft hundreds of boys leaned down toward him, clapped their hands in applause, and laughed so loudly that their laughter drowned out the mad stammering, shouting, and whimpering below.  Huge fiery roses fluttered down and spread a stupefying fragrance.  The crowd gasped for air.​

Then from the altar there sounded a gentle shepherd’s melody.  On the steps sat a naked youth playing the flute.  A startled pause.  And already the boys were leaping from the organ loft in great bounds as shaggy dogs into the crowd and drove them, barking, round and round the church.  The terrified tried to flee.  But the doors were firmly closed.  More and more dogs pressed in on them, baring their teeth.  People rolled on the floor, tried to scramble onto the benches, to climb up to the windows, stumbled over one another, fell, picked themselves up, wrung their hands, snatched at air, and gurgled.​

Then the flute‑playing fell silent.  The youth, the dogs, the roses – all had vanished.  The people stared at one another in horror.  The church doors stood wide open.  No one dared utter a word.  Slowly they turned toward the exit and slipped, crouching and without caring about the others, out into the street.​

 

  
  


[\[i\]](#_ednref1)The name Knud is Scandinavian and means “knot,” while the placename‑surname Ahlbeck situates him atmospherically in a North German-Baltic world of small coastal towns – an apt setting for a provincial judge whose tightly ordered life is about to be disturbed

[\[ii\]](#_ednref2)**Translator’s Note:** Consistorial Councilor Pistorius – The title designates a high church‑administrative official involved in ecclesiastical governance and discipline.  The surname Pistorius is a Latinized occupational name from Latin *pistor* (“baker,” “miller”), parallel to German surnames like Pfister/Becker and indicating an ancestor who baked or milled grain.  In the context of this story, the name thus unobtrusively links a guardian of church order with the producer of bread, inviting comparison with the official “spiritual nourishment” dispensed by the institutional church – an association that stands in pointed contrast to the wild, goat‑like forces that erupt within the church itself.

[\[iii\]](#_ednref3)**Translator’s Note:** Latin, literally “How long, then, Catiline…?”, the famous opening of Cicero’s First Catilinarian Oration against the senator Lucius Sergius Catilina, who in 63 BCE led a failed conspiracy to overthrow the Roman Republic. Cicero, then consul at Rome, used this thunderous question—“Quousque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?” (“How long, then, Catiline, will you abuse our patience?”)—to denounce Catiline as a traitor plotting arson, assassination, and civil war. In this context the churchgoer’s half‑conscious quotation casts the preacher as a dangerous disturber who has gone too far, adopting Cicero’s pose of outraged guardian of public order; at the same time, the high‑flown classical allusion slightly satirizes him, since it inflates an ordinary church disagreement into a grand drama of treason.

The Syntech XR Headset Backpack exists to end that anxiety. Marketed as a purpose‑built, mixed‑reality travel companion, it’s designed for creators, gamers and everyday commuters who want a safer, better‑organized way to carry their XR setup.

Unboxing the Syntech XR Headset Backpack feels like unwrapping something special. The large shipping box keeps it safe from bumps and scratches along the way, so it arrives in perfect shape. Inside, the backpack comes neatly wrapped and padded with air cushions tucked into its compartments to hold its structure. It’s clear Syntech took the time to make sure your first impression matches the quality of what’s inside.

Alongside the bag, you’ll find a detailed user manual that’s worth a quick read. It offers visual guidance on what can fit in the many compartments—headset, controllers, cables, power banks and laptops all have their own clearly suggested spots. It’s surprisingly handy, especially the first time you’re figuring out which items feel most natural in each section.

The Syntech XR Headset Backpack offers a generous 20L capacity, organized into protective layers with 17 smartly designed compartments to help keep all your tech gear neatly organised. The main chamber has a molded pocket where a Meta Quest 3, Quest Pro, or even Apple Vision Pro fits snugly without compressing the head strap. That means less stress on delicate face gaskets and lenses. Below we’ve showcased our Quest 3 with one of the larger premium head straps we’ve reviewed, the [BOBOVR S3 Pro](https://thetechtrendtracker.com/bobovr-s3-pro-battery-strap-review/), fitting effortlessly inside the main compartment with extra room to spare. A convenient mesh compartment nearby provides the perfect spot for storing spare VR batteries, charging cables and other small essentials.

If you own multiple headsets, you’ll appreciate the secondary tech compartment. There’s enough space to pack a second Quest headset and head strap, along with additional gear. After winding the [BOBOVR S3 Pro](https://thetechtrendtracker.com/bobovr-s3-pro-battery-strap-review/) into its most compact form, we found it fit neatly beside two controllers tucked into the adjoining side pouch, all with some room to spare.

As shown in the photo above, the included Velcro dividers are a standout feature, letting you customize and rearrange the interior to your liking. You can fold down or remove them completely to access the backpack’s full 20‑liter capacity. This flexibility makes it easy to transition the bag from a VR‑focused setup to one tailored for photography or general use. There’s also a dedicated laptop compartment designed to hold your computer, keyboard, mouse and everyday work essentials.

Smaller organization touches round out the thoughtful design. The front pouch is ideal for travel documents or passports, while the spacious side pockets can hold water bottles, smartphones, or compact tripods.

On one side, you’ll find a convenient access port for charging cables—perfect for powering up your devices on the go without opening the main chamber.

A discreet back pocket offers quick access to keys, cards and other valuables, keeping them safe and within easy reach.

Finally, the left‑hand pocket compartment is perfectly sized for small electronic accessories such as AirTags, memory cards, or USB adapters.

# Real‑World Use

We put this backpack through its paces. Daily commutes, coffee shop editing, or VR meetups the Syntech XR Headset Backpack holds up across scenarios. On test days involving city walks and train stations, it felt like carrying a hybrid of a premium camera bag and a modern travel pack. There’s no rattling inside due to the secure and customisable velcro compartments and no worrying about scratching tech gear or squashing VR headstraps.

The waterproof zipper design keeps things dry even when caught in drizzle and the outer material wipes clean easily after contact with floors or surfaces. While it’s chunkier than your average laptop bag, that’s a trade‑off worth making when you’re protecting your portable mixed‑reality setup.

# Pros and Cons

# Pros:

* **Purpose‑Built XR Design**: Tailored compartments fit Meta Quest, Vision Pro and similar headsets securely.
* **Ample Storage**: 17 smart compartments create a ready‑to‑go XR kit with room for controllers, cables and a laptop.
* **Weather‑Resistant Build**: Waterproof zippers and resistant fabrics make it reliable for travel and events.
* **Ergonomic Comfort**: Balanced weight distribution and padded support make long carries easy.
* **Professional Aesthetic**: Minimalist, discreet styling that doesn’t attract attention to expensive gear.
* **Travel‑Ready Capacity**: About 20L of space accommodates both XR equipment and daily tech essentials.

# Cons:

* **Heavier Build**: The structured frame adds weight compared to standard laptop backpacks.
* **Pricing**: Costs more than generic bags but delivers excellent value for frequent XR users.

# Final Thoughts

https://preview.redd.it/hejq98tyqmag1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6f51f06d584bdca2cf25be4cebde26980bece94

The Syntech XR Headset Backpack represents a smart leap forward for anyone tired of juggling multiple headset cases, tangled cables and loose controllers every time they travel with their XR or VR gear. The extra structure adds a touch of weight but pays off every time your gear arrives safely at its destination.

If you’re a frequent traveller who uses their headset on the go, VR content creator, or someone who attends XR events, this backpack is a game changer and earns its place instantly. It delivers a rare mix of usability and durability that earns a full 5/5 from us. It might feel like overkill for casual users, but once you’ve rearranged its partitions and found spots for every piece of gear, any normal backpack or case starts to feel like a compromise.

I am consistently hitting 13.8 - 14.00% loss roasting Ugandan Bugisu beans from Happy Mug. 

For a lark, I decided to roast a dark batch for espresso, dropping about 2 minutes after FC, yielding a ~18% loss.

There were no oils immediately after pulling and bagging. But there were some drops two/three days later. 

The results just wasn't my jam. Smokey, earthy but meh to me. Similar to how I react to some Sumatran coffee. Okay in milk in drinks.

As mentioned in another post  I bought 5 pounds of these forgiving beans so as to learn and experiment. 

So now, I can taste compare light/medium to medium to medium dark - the whole spectrum possible with one bean.

I don't at all consider the dark roast experiment a failure. I roasted the bean, tasted  and now have better idea how far I can push a bean before hitting the limits for my taste.

Sam at Fresh Roasting gave me some good guides and I have been enjoying the coffee. As good as RogueWave? lol

Thanks all.

A few months ago, when I was at the Unfinished Furniture store on Oceanside, I noticed that the [Sands Coffee trailer](https://www.sandscoffeeroasters.com/general-4) next to the taco truck had Turkish coffee, which my wife loves. I got some, and it was great. A few weeks later, I picked up some cappuccinos on the way home from Frazier Farms, and my wife was super-impressed. 

I stopped by to get some more last week and I noticed that Mo, the owner, was now selling whole beans that he roasts himself. I bought a tin and holy crap were they good (and the same price as way less-good, non-locally roasted beans at Frazier Farms). My wife actually stopped putting sugar or cream in her coffee after we switched. MASSIVE upgrade.

This is probably old news to many of you, but if you're looking for bomb-assed coffee beans or just a nice chat with a really nice guy while you get a coffee, stop by and say hi to Mo.

If you've ever stared at your screen wondering why that payment is playing hide-and-seek, this app is for you!What Does Invoice Chaser Do?At its core, Invoice Chaser is a smart web app that automates the tedious parts of invoicing so you can focus on growing your business (or, you know, enjoying that well-deserved coffee break). Here's the rundown:

* Easy Invoice Creation: Whip up professional-looking invoices in minutes. Customize templates with your branding, add line items, taxes, and discounts—no design degree required!
* Automated Chasing: Say goodbye to manual follow-ups! Set up gentle (or firm) reminder emails that go out automatically when payments are overdue. It's like having a polite but persistent assistant who never forgets.
* Payment Tracking & Reminders: Real-time dashboard to see who's paid, who's pending, and who's... well, slacking. Get notifications so you're always in the loop.
* Reporting Magic: Generate reports on your cash flow, overdue stats, and more. Spot trends and make smarter decisions without drowning in spreadsheets.

It's built for freelancers, small businesses, and anyone who invoices clients in the UK (or beyond). We're all about keeping things simple, secure, and compliant with UK regs like VAT.

Why I Built It (The Fun Part)I started this because I was chasing invoices more than I was chasing dreams. Late payments suck the joy out of running a business—did you know UK SMEs lose billions to them every year? Invoice Chaser turns that frustration into ""cha-ching!"" moments. Think of it as your invoice superhero: cape optional, but results guaranteed. Best of all? It's affordable—start with a free trial, then plans from just £5/month. No contracts, no hidden fees. And we're constantly adding features based on user feedback (hint: tell me what you want!).

Check it out at [https://invoicechaser.uk](https://invoicechaser.uk/) and let me know what you think. 

Have questions? Drop 'em below—I'm here to chat!

I’m 18 years old and heading into my second semester of college. During my first semester, I really got into my faith (Catholicism). I started attending church regularly, and since it’s right off campus, a lot of students go there.

One night at a student event—where we eat and listen to a message from the priest—I noticed a woman who immediately caught my attention. I almost never approach women, but something about her made me step out of my comfort zone. I introduced myself, got her number, and we went out for coffee the next day.

From there, things moved fast. We texted all day, hung out almost every day, and I fell very hard. I had never felt this way about anyone before. After about two weeks, I told her I loved her. Looking back, it was clearly too early—but at the time, I was completely blinded by how I felt.

One day while hanging out at her apartment, I asked her a question during a quiet moment: “Do you think we ever have deep conversations?” Her answer was no. She then shared that she might not be ready for a relationship and that we had moved way too fast. I didn’t disagree, and we ended things.

The first week was hard, but manageable. I’ve been through breakups before—just never one where I allowed myself to be that vulnerable. School helped distract me, and although I occasionally saw her at church, it didn’t feel overwhelming.

Then winter break started.

With more free time, my mind spiraled. I began replaying everything—not just missing her, but cringing at myself. I feel intense shame over how vulnerable I was, how intimate I allowed myself to be, and especially for saying “I love you” so early.

Since then, I’ve felt stuck in a depressive loop. I constantly beat myself up and can’t seem to find anything good in my life, no matter how hard I try.

I guess I’m asking: can anyone relate to this? Why am I reacting this way? How do you move past the shame and self-hatred after letting yourself feel so deeply?

Fueled by this idealistic letter, Smitty pushes this concept of an ad that isn't an ad, as much as it's setting a mood. It isn't yelling at people about how great their coffee is, but rather setting the mood for Martinson Coffee. 

Anyway, I got to thinking... isn't this the exact thing that Don did for Coca Cola? I mean, I doubt that we're expected to believe Don wrote the lyrics for the song. It was likely him pushing this idea of a song and ""buying the world a coke"" but I can't help but feel like his great big idea that the series ends with is really just him finally listening to what Kurt, Smitty, and Smitty's college friend. 

Maybe I'm missing something else about the Coke spot, but it feels almost as if the Martinson Coffee idea of a brand anthem was ahead of its time and the concept didn't really land, at least in the Mad Men universe, until Don had the idea    again.

I like the idea of a Eureka Mignon Libra because it will weigh out 18g for me. However, if the taste is better on one of these single dose grinders I may just do that extra step of weighing out the coffee beans myself on a scale (thought ideally I'd like the machine to do the weighing"".

For background, I'm single, 33M, and rent an apartment. I moved to a HCOL city in the middle of 2023, and since then my lifestyle has been pretty consistent/routine (work schedule, same number of vacation days, dining, shopping, etc.). I consider myself to be a fiscally responsible person like many people here, and my overall approach to personal finance is to have a healthy relationship with money: I make ""reasonable"" decisions rather than extreme scarcity or reckless spending. That has always been the case as I have gone through many stages of personal finance (broke college student, entry-level professional, broke grad student, mid-level professional).

Looking at my annual spending is funny because it made me remember the big purchases, the mindless spending (Amazon/coffee runs), and awesome vacations that made these couple of years some of the best I've ever experienced. My take is that personal finance is supposed to be enabling, so that you live the life that you want to live.

At a high level, my total spending (tracked by an app):

|Category|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bills|$42,839|$43,587|
|Restaurants|$17,304|$17,500|
|Grocery|$5,485|$4,975|
|Everything Else|$45,158|$48,089|
|**TOTAL**|$110,786|$114,151|

This is a 3% increase, which is pretty close to the rate of inflation. Digging more into these numbers, my top credit card transactions for my ""Everything Else"" category:



|Description (2024 | 2025)|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Lasik | Air Canada|3,890|1,984|
|Down Payment | Hermes|3,000|1,005|
|Burberry | Hotel|2,058|949|
|Canada Goose | Bowers & Wilkins|1,882|741|

Lasik is probably the best thing I've ever purchased. I don't regret any of these purchases and they have all made me very happy.

|West Bank | Cazbar|630|1,083|
|Deja Vu | Modena|329|279|
|L'ardente | Oceana|317|212|

None of these restaurants have made me very happy. I don't think I'm a fine dining guy. The best meals I've had were with friends and family I enjoy spending time with. There were some good dates in there though.

Highest # of transactions in 2025:

Lyft/Uber - 165 transactions (I have a car, so this surprised me)

Amazon - 89 transactions (This did not surprise me)

Starbucks/Dunkin/Compass Coffee - 75 transactions

I look forward to what 2026 is going to bring and hope to do another update. Happy new year!

Questions for everyone: If you've also been tracking your spending, did you also notice any increase in spending? Any decreases? Any large purchases that made you happy?

This is the second recipe being submitted this week and it was great nonetheless. As an r/espresso snob, I grind coffee once if not twice a day. There's a couple of coffee Discords I lurk and I'm also very fortunate to be close by a great local coffee scene. 

As with most of my r/52weeksofcooking submissions, I attempt a recipe that I hadn't done before - [tiramisu](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/easy-tiramisu/) being one of them. You know, growing up and dining out with my family, we hardly ever got desserts. Neither of my parents had a sweet tooth so we often splurged on more apps or nicer entrees, skipping dessert every time. So honestly, I haven't had tiramisu but maybe three or four times ever? The first recipe to pull up via Google was this [Tastes Better from Scratch](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/easy-tiramisu/) with over 7,000 votes for a 4.98 out of 5.00. I had to give it a try.

I grabbed some lady fingers and heavy cream from the local grocery and batched up some decaf espresso. I chose a Counter Culture Slow Motion as my wife is a bit sensitive to caffeine. We also tend to have sweets in the evening and I didn't want that to bug either of us. We both took turns whipping the cream into its nice, fluffy yet thick peaks and added in the mascarpone. Dipped the lady fingers in espresso and layered the cream. 

The tiramisu dessert turned out great! It was a breeze and gave me some confidence in whipping cream by hand. ",3,1767224837.0,52weeksofcooking,0,1.0,False

What makes NordVPN a standout choice in 2026

* Industry-leading security: NordVPN uses AES-256-GCM encryption, a strict no-logs policy, and a host of privacy features like Double VPN, Onion over VPN, and CyberSec to block malicious sites and ads.
* Lightning-fast performance: With a global network of thousands of servers, you can expect reliable speeds for streaming, gaming, and remote work without annoying slowdowns.
* User-friendly across devices: One subscription covers multiple devices, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and browser extensions. It’s easy to set up on routers too.
* Practical for everyday use: Mitigates Wi‑Fi risk in coffee shops, protects sensitive data on public networks, and helps you bypass geo-restrictions to access your favorite content.

Why a NordVPN coupon code makes sense in 2026

* Substantial long-term savings: Coupon codes and promos can dramatically reduce the annual plan, often bringing the price down by more than half or more.
* Budget-friendly protection: By paying less for premium security, you can allocate funds to other essentials like VPN-supported streaming or online privacy tools.
* Flexible plans: NordVPN typically offers a range of plans (monthly, yearly, or multi-year). Coupons usually apply to longer commitments, maximizing value.

Where to find legitimate NordVPN coupon codes

* Official NordVPN promotions page: Start here for current, verified discounts and seasonal offers.
* Authorized partners and tech blogs: Trusted sites often publish time-limited codes that are safe and legitimate.
* Email newsletters: Subscribing to NordVPN updates can unlock exclusive promos not found elsewhere.
* Referral and student programs: Some promotions are tailored for students, freelancers, or new customers.

How to redeem a NordVPN coupon code (step-by-step)

1. Choose a qualifying plan (longer-term plans typically yield the best discount).
2. Click through the NordVPN promo link to ensure you land on the official checkout page.
3. Enter your coupon code in the Promo Code or Discount field during checkout.
4. Verify that the discount is reflected in the order summary before completing payment.
5. Set up your NordVPN account and install the app on your devices.

Tips for maximizing savings

* Bundle with a longer-term plan: Annual or 2-year terms often unlock the largest percentage discounts.
* Stack promotions when allowed: Some codes can be combined with seasonal sale prices, but always confirm at checkout.
* Use a price comparison mindset: If a deal looks too good to be true, verify it on NordVPN’s official channels to avoid scams.
* Consider student or corporate promos: If you’re eligible, these programs can dramatically lower the price.

What you get with NordVPN beyond basic protection

* Robust privacy tools: Customizable features to tailor your security posture, including kill switch, auto-connect, and split tunneling.
* Seamless streaming access: Unblock popular platforms and avoid geo-restrictions while maintaining high video quality.
* Secure remote work: Protected connections for VPN-enabled work tools, ensuring confidential information stays private.

Common questions about NordVPN discounts

* Do NordVPN coupons expire? Yes, most coupons are time-limited. Always check the expiration date on the promo page.
* Can I stack multiple coupons? It varies by promotion. In most cases, you can’t stack, but you may find one code that offers a larger single discount.
* Is NordVPN worth the money in 2026? For many users, yes. The combination of strong security, speed, and ease of use often justifies the investment—especially when discounts bring the price within reach.

Conclusion  
A NordVPN coupon code offering up to 76% off in 2026 can transform premium online security into an affordable habit.

So my mom being the problem solver said she will give my sister a hundred dollars so she could get at least something. Well today my mom got paid but it was barely any money left after my mom paid the bills. So my mom told my sister that she would have to call her grandfather to get some money. And instead of just doing it and getting the money and everything being alright she insisted began to complain and get mad and cry. And she tried to bring up the fact that my mom brought me a iPad for Christmas but my dad brought it for me and my mom is just paying the phone bill for it. And at that moment I was just done with her she’s almost eighteen she has a job and every Christmas before this Christmas she got things that were hundreds of dollars.

I would love to get to know you!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one special someone that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in a real, genuine connection and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of meeting a long term partner, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring person. An individual that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in that special someone. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is ready to make it work with a guy named shadow\_surf haha.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a partner?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* Loyal, trusting, and honest
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

Arrived promptly and I noticed a dent on the bottom of the tumbler. No problem, I set up a return with the option to replace with exact same item. Two weeks later I get the replacement. It's the same exact damaged item! I know this because the bottom dent was in the same location. Also the product label, a paper strip that wraps around it was askew. It was askew because I had removed it and put it back on before I noticed the dent when it first arrived. 

I reach out to Amazon customer service and talk on the phone with rep #1. It is an outsourced associate and he tells me that he's going to refund me for my inconvenience AND send out a replacement right away, within 48 hours. I did receive a refund immediately, confirmed through my bank account. Great! 

Three days later, I see nothing on my Amazon account about a replacement item in transit. I reach out via chat to Associate #2. I tell him what happened and he responds that Associate #1 was lying, that they cannot send out a replacement because one had already been sent previously. The one that I had returned and Amazon sent back as a ""new replacement"". I ask him what does he recommend to solve this. He promptly disconnects...I see a message on chat say ""R has experience tech difficulties and A will now assist you"".

I tell rep #3 the entire story and he says ""NP, I've processed the return fast tracked a replacement to you"". I check my email and see an Amazon notification thanking me for returning an extra item that was shipped to me and that no further refund would be issued as the ""extra"" item was sent in mistake. Rep #3 tells me to ignore the return email, that all is well. I see no further emails or notification/update on my account about a replacement tumbler being ordered or shipped to me. What are the chances that a replacement tumbler will arrive? I see it listed in Amazon, with the 2 day delivery date. But the price is now x2 as the sale is over.  What are the chances that this Rep #3 is not being totally honest? Any advice on how to proceed?",1,1767224000.0,amazonprime,2,0.6,False

Anyways, sometimes he could be cool for half a day but still makes comments. We all lost our jobs. He started coming into my new job daily for hours. he’s retired military. He then got a job there… It proceeded worse. He started grabbing me more making more comments. Recently he slapped my butt and said it was payment for bussing my tables. ( i work at a small indian owed family diner) their english is okay but i don’t think they understand how bad the situation is. Anyways, the next shift he asked me to “make my fucking coffee” for him. I said i brewed it. he said no cream sugar in a mug. i said no. He started touching me while there were customers. i said don’t touch me. He said if i can’t touch you im not touching your tables. Mind you one of my coworkers F40 has worked with me since that place that closed and this new job. She knows all about it and sometimes he makes vulgar comments to her as well. 

I told my brother and bf about it. They flipped. went to a restaurant to eat at where he is a regular and he was there. My brother was livid and confronted  him. He called the cops on me my brother and bf. He pressed charges on us. How??? Anyways, cops called me i told them what had been going on but they were quick phone calls at 2 am cause the cop on my case works over nights. Cops went to look at cameras. couldn’t find anything.

I just cannot with the fucking Salvage Bakery spot in town.  

I mean nothing says gentrification like an $8 donut.   But there is much more to dislike about this place:

- the annoying operating hours 
- the fact that they only would sell you a $32 boxes of donuts today (because it is a holiday) 
- the dumb line down the street in the cold to just pick up said pre ordered pastries.  


Ok -- and before y'all come for me in the comments I'll be the first to admit that they  make a damn tasty pasty / donut.  

And no. I didn't buy the pastry box. 

Edit:  it's not the folks at the pastry shop.  It's everything on the damn block!   The $10 points of beer, the $60 haircuts, the $7 cups of coffee.   

Edit 2: If you think $8 pastries is normal then maybe I'm the crazy one.  My apologies.  I just miss the old JC

The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to during my youngest years swept me away and sparked my interest in penpalling. That was before it was easier to meet someone halfway across the world than next door.

What I'd like is to penpal with a person and not penpal for the sake of penpalling. The culture of 'receiving something other than junk and bills in the mail' was never for me. I want a connection, and someone to engage with on a personal level that happens to take the form of penpalling. Snail mail letters/packages and e-mails are my ideals.

In regards to MBTI, I first tested as INTJ during my teens and continued to primarily test as it into my 30s. More recently, I sometimes get INFJ. I've also gotten INTP and ISTJ before.

I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure and adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

I love coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

Today I figured why not try:
AeroPress with Prismo attachment

#### 1. The Grind: Espresso Fine
*   **Grinder:** 1Zpresso K Ultra.
*   **Setting:** **2.5**.
   

#### 2. The Ratio: 
*   **Coffee:** 20g (Renegade Guatemala).
*   **Water:** 60ml - 70ml (Total).
*   **Ratio:** ~1:3.
    

#### 3. The Setup
*   **Brewer:** AeroPress with **Fellow Prismo** attachment.
    
*   **Filter:** Use the metal Prismo filter *without* a paper filter 

#### 4. The Brew Protocol
1.  **Heat Water:** Go to **208°F 
2.  **Add Coffee:** Dump the 20g 
3.  **Pour:** Add 60-70ml of water vigorously.
4.  **Agitate:** Stir aggressively for 10-20 seconds.
5.  **Steep:** Let it sit for 1 to 2 minutes.
6.  **The Press:** Press the plunger down **hard and fast**.

*   **The Sugar:** In a separate metal pitcher or sturdy mug, place your desired amount of sugar (classic Cuban style is sweet, usually 1–2 tsp per serving). Pour the hot coffee concentrate *immediately* over the sugar and stir vigorously to dissolve.
*   **The Milk:** Heat about 4–6 oz of milk (approx 150ml) until scalding hot (or steam it if you have a wand).
*   **Combine:** Pour the hot milk into the sweetened coffee mixture.

Funny thing about me promising a chapter on NYE last week. That cold got worse on Christmas Day and came with the wombo combo of what I really hope was chocolate and coffee grounds (and I neither remember eating that much chocolate nor did I eat coffee grounds) coming out an orifice that things are supposed to go in, not out. Regardless, I’m posting this chapter now so I lived, bitch! I’m just gonna try to be a bit more careful about tempting Murphy.

Nothing like an anthology chapter to catch up with a bunch of people. Consider it a grand tour of characters and plots not important enough to get a proper chapter. Certainly nothing important going on. Nope, nothing. And no anime references. Who said there were? No! No points for whoever finds the reference that clearly doesn’t exist. They’re as wrong as the person who claimed there was anything worth reading here. I mean, the first PoV is Rumi, he’s just… a bridge officer on Sovlin’s ship… uh… Smokebomb!

Synopsis: Magic was once real and present but faded away in the distant past, becoming nothing but the myths and legends we know as the surviving beings fled to other planes, only to publicly return during the Sat Wars. How would it change first contact and beyond? Only one way to find out.

I have a [spot on the discord](https://discord.com/channels/1046919438521344090/1379966890381807646), swing on by! Thanks to SpacePaladin15 for the original universe; my alpha readers, Caro Morin and Jailed Cinder; my beta readers, Angustus\_Jan on the discord and u/aroluci (go check out Children of Luna, it’s awesome); and all of you that read and especially comment. Anybody interested in playing around in the AU (be it a one-shot, an impromptu ficnap, a cameo, or something more), let me know and I’ll be more than happy to work with you on it. My current plan is to release a chapter a week, with the occasional bonus, as long as that isn’t too much for everybody helping me.

Without further ado, enjoy!

**Date \[Standardized Terran Time\]: August 26****^(th)****, 2136**

The Prime Minister has been gathering our forces to break into the Venlil Republic en masse, assuming the captain is right. That is assuming he can be trusted since the captain has been behaving oddly, like a predator amped up on stimulants. We all knew something was wrong, but none of us know who to trust to do something about it since he hasn’t done anything yet. Aside from attacking that ship. With so many systems irreparably down until we could get back to port, there was nothing for most of the bridge crew to do. I decided to make myself useful with the comms destroyed and link my station to the ship’s cameras, pulling up the feed from where the captain has docked us to the strange ship.

‘It didn’t look dangerous. It looked like a work of art. Maybe a small but heavily embellished freighter? The weapons it had were clearly dangerous, but we just attacked a new species, one that allied itself with the Venlil. One that discovered warp on their own, has ships that almost look grown, and weapons that shoot through shields. We may have made an enemy for the Federation.’

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Advance 20 STD minutes**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The bridge crew was herded around my station, watching as the captain pulled the alien in a vac suit matching the ship out. Spines flared, and everybody gasped as we saw that they were a predator. It makes no sense. That Venlil was protecting them, that makes no sense.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Advance 1 STD hour**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We all stared, transfixed, as the captain walked… no, stalked around the predator. Claws of one paw playing with the plasma torch on one side, tapping the collar in the other. Once the predator starts to stir, the captain pounces on top of the predator’s back. “Good, done pretending?”

“What… what happened? Where?” The predator groans.

“Your captive is free, predator.” Sovlin slams the predator’s head to the decking, harvesting a pained groan from the predator.

“Free? Slanek is…”

Another slam. “We’re going to let the entire Federation know. We should have bombed your vile dens even if we thought you humans were dead. We’ll correct that mistake now.”

The predator shouts, I’d think they were panicked if not for what they are. “Wait! No! We’re not your enemy! We want to be frien-”

Sovlin slams the predator's head to the decking multiple times before laughing. The plasma torch ignites, far more than should be needed to cut through armor so thin, based on the ship he came from. I lean to the side and empty my stomach as the predator screams in pain while Sovlin begins to cut at the left shoulder of the armor, and the body beneath.

It had been some time since I was last talked to by the captain. I had seen that several members of the crew of both captured bombers were taken from the brig, but they hadn’t returned. When I inquired about the disappearances during a food delivery, the next meal came with a response from the captain. Something about them being defective. These humans must be better at detecting them. There were suspicions that much of the crew on the bombers was defective, but it hadn’t been confirmed. New hunters with low performance numbers and older hunters who had been underperforming for some time. Those suspected of showing mercy. That was why they were sent along with a few trusted hunters, so we could scent them out. These humans would prove great allies against the Federation! We don’t even need cattle with what the humans can make.

There was a thought nipping at my tail. Something that I was missing. I had been thinking over my talk with the captain constantly, trying to figure out what it was and how I could use it to my advantage. I hadn’t told the captain too much, just enough to prove my use. Especially as a friendly replacement for Isif, I would have power and little need to work with the humans serving my will. I could enjoy myself. Hmm… the human captain told me a lot. Every time I adjusted to the information, she had a new reveal. She just wanted…

I was finally through my current workload, outside of anything marked lowest priority. Bureaucratic code for ‘to be ignored’ but used on anything that can’t simply be shredded. There were a few ongoing situations that I couldn’t help with, but if I didn’t stay busy, I would be expected to sit in hoping to expedite approvals later, even if my presence was, at best, pointless. Most of it was practically repetition of work my people had just done anyway. Preparing how to handle the nearly non-existent governmental structures outside of the Federation itself. Financial, scientific, military, education, near every aspect of their society relies on the Federation government or its founders. While we could take their place and make the Venlil Republic a protectorate, it would make us little better than the Federation, and to add more allies in the same way would require exploiting them just to keep things running. We have multiple plans in place to make the Venlil a true ally, able to stand on their own. The experts can extrapolate that to the other polities without my input. Last I saw, they were already working on plans for that, some sort of supranational compact or hierarchical confederation. A good leader knows when to stay out of things; thus, I started going over things that would typically be allowed to sit until they became irrelevant enough to discard.

As I went through these trivial reports, I found a number that referenced a prospective Emergency Order Fifty-Six. Most are requests for the individual responsible to be disciplined or at least their identity to be made known. After an hour of searching, I finally found the proposal. An anonymous submission of a suggestion, elevated as high as an intern would be able to, but that doesn’t give many hints as to the identity of the submitter. Many proposals stop at that level as people don’t wish to put their names to them. Others are submitted by citizens or private concerns, and an intern pushes them, often by accident, as one slips into an otherwise contiguous batch by a single submitter.

The proposal is an extraordinarily draconian censorship law to make us more palatable for the Federation mindset, restricting what media and subjects can be discussed with the aliens or even where they may overhear on pain of jail time. Something that was violated rather quickly by not only the *Odyssey* team but also our plans for the subject matter exchanges. Nearly every department has commented on the proposal, finding different ways to tear it apart.

I settled in for an entertaining few hours. Maybe I should get some popcorn?

The First Fleet was doing its duty in Sol and the area around it. The Second Fleet was off in the Republic. The Third Fleet and First Strategic Fleet are supplementing the patrols. The Fourth and Fifth Fleets are being put together. The finished ships are ready to supplement as needed. The nine system defense stations have been updated to Fed tech. Two more colony defense stations are finished and waiting to be sent out, with plans to build three more system defense stations. Space is already being claimed for the construction in orbit of Earth. The automated stations are halfway through refit, while more are being pumped out. The Gungnir stations are in the same position. Most of the new production on those will likely go to our allies, much as we can at least, since they can’t do basic alchemy. There’re still civilian crafts, too. I’m stuck managing the building, refitting, and repairs of everything as we have no out-of-system shipyards yet. The stations can effect repairs, but even that is managed through my office. Sure, it’s my job, but people are adjusting to there suddenly being two large factions of aliens that would kill us all in an instant, not through better tech but raw numbers. Production is slowing down, both due to losing the urgency of the first month and assigning crew to the ships and stations as they’re constructed. Hopefully, our allies can come through with some of the more complex parts premade for us.

“Dad, you ok?” Ingrid asks, standing by the shuttle off the shipyard. Her voice brings me back to the present, out of the thoughts that are keeping me grounded.

“Yeah, yeah. Just thinking about how much work I’m going to have without the two of you.” I say with a grin, hoping they don’t notice the tears in my eyes.

Derec sniffles, not even trying to hide how he’s tearing up. ""Ye'll hae less tae fret aboot wi' us awa on station, boss. Or is it that ye dinnae trust me when I'm oot o' yer sight? Hardly imagine lettin' yer lassie gang off wi' a lad ye dinnae trust.""

I laugh and clap my future son-in-law on the arm. “Son, I’m the one who suggested you. I would have tried to set the two of you up. The ones I don’t trust are the ones who are going to replace you and my daughter. She hid you. She’d best not hide my grandchildren before they’re born.”

“Dad!” Ingrid shouts, the pair blushing. She smiles. “We’re an hour flight away from home. Half an hour from here. Seconds away if you call. Anyway, we’d at least get married before that.”

Derec’s eyes go wide as he stammers wordlessly.

I laugh. “Good. I already approve. Call if you want family contacts for the ring. Know a few good smiths.”

Ingrid scoffs. “Like we’d go out of family for that. At least give us a year or two before you start pestering us, dad.” She smiles gently up at my future son-in-law. “Derec is stressed enough by us moving in together this fast.”

‘Skatek has been off for the past few days. I thought maybe it was just the attack. That if I gave him time, then he’d go back to normal. Maybe bringing him along to the temple was a mistake? Maybe opening up to him about my issues was a mistake? Am I supposed to always be strong? I know I have the muscle, but… I just like looking like this. Jan’s the tough one.’

I barely needed to think as I checked over one of the station’s fighters. Minor discrepancies in the mana flow caused a lag in the switching of elements. Unimportant in space, but potentially critical in atmosphere. The exact place fighters like this shine. The only one they’re meant to operate.

‘Could he be freaked out about the Arxur attack? We fought them off, though? Maybe he’s worried we’ll think that the Venlil aren’t worth our time? Thinking he’s falling behind because he’s having trouble getting anything to do with artifice? We need regular engineers too! Split duties! He gets the mundane tech better than I do anyway! At least after the latest upgrades…’

A minor misalignment in some of the focusing crystals. They’re near some of the railgun capacitors. Somebody probably accidentally nudged one while doing a check. The fighters are so tight compared to everything else.

‘He’s always been more distant than most of the others in the exchange. Have I been doing something wrong? I’ve talked to people, and they haven’t had any advice for me. What am I doing wrong?’

Sovlin hasn’t been to the bridge since the predator, the human, was captured. Recel has barely been on the bridge either, leaving running things to our weapons and effective second officer, Jemic. There hasn’t been much point; we’ve been making random warp jumps under Sovlin’s standing orders and trying to repair what we can. We barely even have local sensors. We can’t even tell if we’re jumping off the galactic plane. We can only pray that the Protector will guide us back to Federation space, assuming that Sovlin’s actions aren’t so vile that she’s averted her gaze from us.

I glance at my console, and the entire bridge crew is gathered around it anyway. At least when we aren’t setting a new, random course. Either we’re flying blind or waiting to fly blind.

From the feed from the brig, there are screams of pain over the sound of the plasma torch. “Please! Please! We… we just want to be your friends… Why? Why are you doing this? Please…” The human wails again.

“Doctor Kuemper,” I interrupt, “I already read the proposal and the responses from the other departments. As long as there are stations ready and things go well during the introductions, or the Zurulians and Yotul are willing to start a staggered exchange on *Charity Station*, then your plan has full approval once the diplomats give the green light. Colonization has priority. We’re both too overworked to waste time. Especially with the moral concerns in bringing in the Zurulians and the tactical concerns, given we have a Leirn native with confirmed magic.”

Erin sighs. “Thank you, sir. That’s a relief. I had a whole presentation ready. You saved me thirty minutes.”

“I saved us both-” There’s a knock on my door. I sigh. “Come in!”

Jones enters, closing the door behind her and activating the privacy field. “Sir, two military exchange members have been AWOL for, we suspect, a day. The two that flew off during the raid. We haven’t confirmed that they’re off station, but there’s a problem.”

“Should.. I not be here for this?” Erin asks.

“You’d find out later. Just don’t say anything until we brief people on it.” Jones responds. “We haven’t confirmed it yet, but there were transmissions from the ship they had previously used that have been flagged as sounding like Lieutenant Fraser. Given that it was checked out under Lieutenant Markus Frank and his partner, Slanek. Transmissions that put them directly in the path of an ongoing operation.”

“What operation?” I ask.

“Operation Pronged Blowout. The unstable element was successfully manipulated and set off on the expected course in the event they weren’t taken into custody. The ship entered a temporary blind area, and from there, we lost track. There are a few possibilities, but most likely our missing pilots decided to go against orders and got captured by an individual who was flagged as a threat and needed to be taken off the board, no matter how we approached the Union. Either becoming a direct threat to a party involved or sneaking off to inform the entire Federation.” Jones responds.

“Pronged Blowout?” Kuemper asks. “Wait… the Union. A Gojid? Are you talking about Captain Sovlin?”

“Yes, and the name is better than the initial proposals of Spiky Tantrum or Stabby Crash Out,” Jones says, completely deadpan.

I watch my ex-commander and fellow prisoner, Kroshrak. Once an entertainment for me, and now my greatest annoyance. At the very least, I had learned that whatever this clear material is that makes up the front of the cell, it’s stronger than an Arxur can damage. “Why are you so calm?” The fool growls, the sound dampening off the past day. “You haven’t tried to free yourself. You haven’t tried to strike at these prey. They slaughter their own to feed us better than any farm!”

I chuff at the absurdity. “You utter fool, if we’re ever returned to the Dominion, I will have you killed. Slowly.”

“Wha? You have no pow-”

I growl, tail lashing the decking. “I am a junior hunter placed by Betterment to hunt the weak and foolish in the Chief Hunter’s sector. *And you will listen and obey.*” The fool lowers his head in appropriate submission. “We were captured by *predators*. Ones who can *create* their own food. Who can eat as the prey do if they desire. Who have been growing flesh for us from animals they bred for centuries as food, yet have been feeding us what they would consider *scraps*. The humans have made it abundantly clear that we cannot escape, and that resistance is pointless at best and painful at worst. Compliance will see rewards. It would seem that being defective is a form of complying.”

As if on cue, a human in pelts steps into view with something in their claw. So long as food isn’t being delivered and none of us are being escorted to interrogation, the humans sometimes would wear such things instead of their armor. “Defectors, not defectives. Though with the intel we have that too.” The human brings the rough brown thing shaped like a piece of what they call chicken in their claw up to their face, taking a bite and tearing off a chunk. There’s an obvious bone inside.

“What?” Kroshrak growls, likely as he spots the bone. “I-is that a bone?”

On the screen, Sovlin continues to torment the human. Thankfully, he isn’t using the plasma cutter anymore. It ran out of power early yesterday, just as the last of the human’s armor was cut through, but not before Sovlin left permanent marks. Significant ones. “You monsters killed my wife and daughter!” He lets go of the button for the shock collar and claws at the human’s face, dangerously close to one of their eyes.

“We didn’t… We wouldn’t… We AAARGH!!!!” The human convulses as Sovlin triggers the collar again.

“Predators are all the same!” He shouts as he lets go of the button again. “Who cares that it wasn’t you? I’ll get my revenge for them! They’re crying out for justice!” When the human falls, Sovlin starts to kick at their ribs and stomp on their arm. “Take this!” Thud. “My love!” Thwack. “My anger!” Crack. “All of my sorrow!” Snap! The collar erupts with electricity. Burning the human’s flesh. The shining arcs reflecting off the decking before Sovlin reaches to grab the predator’s arm, the bone protruding even before he starts to twist.

“C-could somebody take that off the main screen?” Devic, our helmsman, asked.

“No,” Jemic says firmly, not noticing as the door to the bridge opens and Recel walks in. “While what Sovlin is doing is being recorded and stored in the event that we can return to Federation space or get captured. He is torturing a member of a species who are obviously allied with the Venlil and not a threat to anybody. How else could you explain the human only expressing a desire for peace and begging to know the Venlil is ok even as they get tortured? By the Protector, they even said they don’t eat flesh! They’re begging for *fruit*! Even if they were an Arxur, this is… is just wrong. This isn’t interrogation… it’s predation.”

Jemic flinches as a guttural scream comes from the screen, but she continues. “We owe it to the Union, to the Federation, to the Venlil, and to the humans to watch. To become a living documentation of that burrow-blighting rot-bringer’s crimes. He’s beyond predator diseased. He’s beyond a predator. If we make it out, it needs to be known that he’s not safe and that… that his word cannot be trusted. That he might have made an enemy we didn’t need. If the humans find us… Then we need to be able to try to make peace, no matter the cost. We all saw that ship. You didn’t see my sensors. You didn’t see that the weapons that were firing through our shields were tuned down. That the shots that destroyed our missiles would core this ship and more behind. If they wanted us dead, we would be. If they wanted us disabled, we would be. They wanted us to leave without harming us.” Jemic swallows audibly. “The system didn’t flag it, but it looked like a fatal overload was detected and overridden in their railguns. From the angle when they cut in… it looked like the Venlil was at the controls for that, not the human. The Venlil that ordered us to leave. Rightly and legally. This is nothing but a *raid*. Even if we can make things right, we’re no better than the Grays.” Jemic sighs, a tear rolling from her eye as she stares at the screen.

“That ship was beyond anything the Federation or Dominion could make, and it looked like a shuttle. A freighter. Anything but a warship.” Jemic screws her eyes shut. “If they can make more than that… then if they’re our enemies, we’re as good as dead. The sensors showed a massive station moved at warp. Over \[seven kilometers\] long. Fighting them would leave us vulnerable to the Arxur. If we could ally with them, like the Venlil might have… Sovlin mentioned new species, plural… If we had stopped him, then the war may well be won. If we talked or just never came. Instead, that human’s blood is on our paws too, and we don’t get to forget that, ever. We’re the reason for everybody who dies if they attack. If this leads to a war, we have already lost.”

“You’re right, Jemic,” Recel says, defeated. “Everything she said is right, but… but there’s more you need to know. Sovlin had unofficial orders from Piri. He recorded audio from their meeting and sent it to me. It’s loaded onto everything, even the escape pods. You need to hear it… This, all of this, is treason.” He presses a button on his holopad and audio begins to play.

We didn’t know who we could trust outside of the bridge crew. Jemic was, at least for the bridge crew, officially the new first officer for Captain Recel. We just needed to figure out how to get them their ship and free the hostages. For that, we needed time. Time to ensure we could take the *Bountiful Harvest* from Sovlin and his loyalists, time to ensure that both hostages were safe, time to ensure that we wouldn’t have to deal with a counter-mutiny, time to ensure this isn’t pointless, and we could navigate after we have control instead of slowly dying in space.

Captain Recel is using this time to try to talk Sovlin down. If our mutiny can be bloodless, then that would be better, but that’s not why. No, we aren’t sure what Sovlin might have done in the event of an escape, as impossible as that is. We suspect that he changed the access codes for both the brig and the med bay. We also know that he locked all the plasma weapons away in his quarters, leaving the crew with only ballistics and flamethrowers. We just have to hope he didn’t tie the self-destruct into the alarm like some captains do.
