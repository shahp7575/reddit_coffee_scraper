But I'm getting real tired of vendors slapping ""AI-powered"" and ""revolutionary"" on what's essentially the same vulnerability scanning we've had for years, just with a nicer UI.

The demo I sat through was basically static code analysis that we've had since 2005, some config file checking, generic threat intel feeds you can get anywhere, and a fancy UI that probably costs more than my annual coffee budget. They kept talking about their ""innovative approach"" but when you dig into the technical details, it's the same old pattern matching and signature-based detection we've been dealing with forever.

Meanwhile, my team is still drowning in ""critical"" alerts that turn out to be false positives, and we STILL can't get actual visibility into what's happening in our runtime environments. I'm spending more time triaging garbage alerts than actually securing.

1lctplf,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1lctplf/dont_underestimate_the_importance_of_a_good_diet/,Don’t underestimate the importance of a good diet.,"For a bit of context, I’m 20M, quite lean/athletic. 
I remember in school I used to have days where my eyes would water trying to look at the board. 

Or days after work/uni where I’d sink into the couch, my mind trying to remind me to do chores/ head to the gym but nonetheless, I’d lay there sleeping for an hour or two.

Note that I’ve always been quite lean and active throughout most days. Despite this, I was pretty much always slow to start in the morning and was always yawning in class / sitting down. I got my iron levels checked and they were in the normal range. 

Now fast-forward to today, about 6 months ago I decided to eat mostly whole foods while at home. This meant that about 90% of the time I’d eat clean foods. I’m saying this because that’s really the only thing that I’ve changed in that period; everything else has pretty much stayed the same. Still exercise, stil spend time studying, still go on my phone before bed and wake up quite early.

Just this past week alone I got about 6 hours each  night, and one night when I went to bed at 2am and woke up at 6:30 for work.

This may sound somewhat adequate, but a couple years prior I’d been getting 8,9 hours and still feeling tired at the same periods throughout the day: late morning, early-late afternoon.

At not one point during that entire week did I feel one lick of sleepiness. Even when I went to bed, I never got gradually tired until I dropped. I’d just lie there contemplating life, close my eyes, and open them at 7:30am and get out of bed like nothing ever happened. No struggle getting out either. This was regardless of whether I went to bed at 11,12, 1 or 2 am.

This follows a trend of the past few months. I’m so full of beans that I can’t even sit down and scroll on my phone anymore because I feel like I need to be doing something more or moving around. It’s gotten to the point where my energy is impacting my studies. I can’t sit still for more than a few minutes. No more naps, and my mind feels just as sharp at 11PM as it does at 8AM.

I still consume sugar, but only about one teaspoon in a coffee in the morning and about 3 small slabs of chocolate in the evening 3 times a week. Other than that when I crave sugar I now go for things like grapes, mandarins, apples.

Everyday I eat the same thing. A banana, two eggs on toast, cottage cheese, Greek yoghurt, a citrus fruit and rice/ pasta + chicken/ beef and occasionally salmon. 

I used to have issues being tired, but the only things that changed has been my diet. No processed foods/ saturated fats. 

Let me know what you guys think and good luck.",1,1750082768.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

This also serves as a megathread for coffee deals on the internet. If you see a good deal, post it here! However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Daily Question Thread would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

What would be a good stain to stain those bare spots?  The surface is textured and has lots of variations by design, so it doesn't have to be a perfect match.  
I figured I will use a rag to stain with some oil based finish (maybe ""walnut"" color) and then cover with a few light coats of water based poly.   Any suggestions on what time of stain to use and what color?

Hey hey 👋

So here’s the tea 🍵 (or coffee, if you're that kind of person):

I just passed 12th, heading into college life soon (yes, real adulting 😭), and here I am — single since birth. Not in a “mysterious bachelor” kind of way… more like “bro wasn’t even in the race” kinda way.

But hey, I’m not totally hopeless:

* I'm decent at studies (read: won't fail, might help you in maths, will definitely vibe over late-night rant sessions)
* My looks? Somewhere between *guy-you'd-roast-affectionately* and *guy-you’d-maybe-let-hold-your-hand-if-it’s-cold*
* Personality? Think funny, slightly awkward, good listener, and 100% non-creepy simp energy 🙃

I’ve never had a girlfriend (or even a close girl-friend tbh), but I think if someone gave me the time of day… they’d actually enjoy talking to me. I’m sweet, funny, and can keep a convo alive longer than your Duolingo streak 🐦🔥

So if you're:

* Cool
* Cute
* Or just bored and curious about how this adorable loner ended up emotionally available with no one to flirt with

Slide in. Let's talk. Who knows? Maybe our texts will get longer than CBSE answers 😏

1lctg71,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1lctg71/war_against_the_roaches_has_begun/,"War against the roaches has begun,","Unfortunately for me I live in the barracks in Oahu. Roaches love Hawaii and Roaches love the barracks. My room overtime has had more and more roach sightings. I kill the one so see and then clean what I can. Unfortunately I have pretty limited cleaning supplies at the moment. I’m also injured. I recently got surgery in my knee and I’m crutching around everywhere with a brace. My roommate is not here and he’s gonna be gone for a long time. I don’t have pesticides and I don’t have borax or any other handy dandy roach killer. And since The weekend is over it might be a bit before I can get my much needed cleaning supplies…

Well anyways I noticed decent activity coming from behind the desks in my room. The one on my side and the one on my roommates side. Conveniently right next to each other with about a foot of spacing apart. I moved my desk just a bit and what do you know. It’s roach heaven. It’s my turn for the infestation I suppose. So since I now can’t sleep I’m trying to find ways to deal with them with my lack of items. I’ve used a handful of red solo cups that I acquired from beer pong and filled them with water. Each at different levels. I put all kinds of things in them and each one is different. Crumbled cookies, toothpaste, coffee, adobo, and toothpaste. And I mixed the water with soap. Not sure why I added the soap. I guess I hoped that would contribute in some way to them drowning. Then I attempted to make a glue trap. I got a dryer sheet and smeared happy nuts comfort cream on it and mixed it with cookies. Then drizzled dish soap on that. Fingers crossed that works. It probably won’t. 

I found one of the suckers and trapped an empty cup over him. I decided it would take too long for him to die in there and I’d probably forget in a couple days and move it and he’d crawl on me and bad things would happen. So I flipped it over and took him to the sink. Well as the water rose quickly so did he. He got out and now on my sink. I used my dish soap and sniped him with it. I watched his pathetic attempt to crawl out as he flipped over and died extremely quickly to my surprise. To make sure he wasn’t pretending I poured another layer of it on him. I found one more in the trash. I used my fabric sprayed and sprayed him a ton. He ran away but before long he emerged sluggishly. I drowned him with more sprays before a final layer of dish soap was applied. 

I will keep killing them anyway I can with whatever I have. But I know it won’t be long before I’m out of soap and fabric spray and even cups. I have plenty of happy nuts cream though. What do you guys think. What would be other effective ways to rid these abominations? I have about 94 tide pods on hand, half a box of dryer sheets, paper towels i think, dangerously low on Toilet Paper, 1/4 of dish soap, >1/4 of fabric spray, toothpaste, and gold bond.

1lctfx9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I,"Fun facts, trivias, and easter eggs about Into The New World","\-The song was composed by songwriter Kenzie (from Berklee College of music) and was originally to be included in M.I.L.K.'s (a Kpop group in the early 2000's) album which will be released from 2002-2003. but it later became Girls' Generation's debut song due to the breakup of M.I.L.K.   
  
\-There's a classical song in 1893 titled Symphony No. 9: ""From the New World"" also known as ""Symphony No. 9"" by Dvorak. SNSD used a same tune in that song and just changed the rhythm (hint: it's the 1st line of the song sung by Taeyeon). It also inspired the title of their song ""Into The New World"". Also a cute coincidence, SNSD originally has 9 members that goes well with the title ""Symphony No. 9""   
  
\-In the legendary scene at [0:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I&t=21s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH) where all of them are lined up with their hands on their back, in case you want to know how they are lined up, its: Yuri on the front, then Yoona, Sooyoung, Jessica, Sunny, Seohyun, Hyoyeon, Taeyeon, and Tiffany   
  
\-In here it showed that Jessica and Sunny are together. The meaning behind this is because Jessica is the 1st girl that is recruited in the SNSD group. Sunny is the last one recruited. It symbolize a full circle and the graffiti they made in here (that says ""New World 2007"") symbolize the start of the new world (careers) for them as SNSD.   
  
\-This song is released in 2007. But did you know that the choreography on this song is already made even before they were all recruited? And it took them a year practicing just this song and have mastered it even before their debut. Sooyoung and Hyoyeon mentioned it.   
  
\-Their white outfits on [2:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I&t=150s) is the outfit that the wore when they performed this song live for the first time ever. It's not on TV or a music show, but the first time they performed this is actually on Seorak Waterpia resort, with just an average number of crowd. It's on the show SNSD-Girls Go To School (Ep.4)   
  
\- On [2:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I&t=150s), we can see Yoona having a necklace with a cross since she's a Christian. At [3:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I&t=230s) though, we can see Jessica having a necklace with a weed or something lol. If the video was released in this era, she and the group will automatically get cancelled.  
  
\-Yuri plays as a barista here, and after the video shoot, she actually made a coffee for herself and all the rest of the crew (sweet Yuri) for real. And around 2020, she actually took culinary classes and now is posting cooking videos on her youtube channel (she still feeds her crew) and has been on tons of cooking shows.  
  
\-Taeyeon and Yuri were there the whole time watching Seohyun as she was doing the ballerina scene. It's just outside the coffee shop where Yuri shot her scene. Taeyeon was there too to shoot a scene too at [2:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I&t=162s)   
  
\-Hyoyeon originally wanted the scooter scene in this video, but she had to do the dance break scene at [2:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I&t=136s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH). The directors said they would just give her the scooter. She waited and waited but they never gave it to her. It was then revealed that it is actually owned by Shindong of Super Junior.   
  
\-Tiffany is the only one here who had the chance to introduce her name out of all the members in this video. It's in the scooter scene on [3:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I&t=198s) where she posted her name on the customized license plate with the Hanja version of ""Girls' Generation"" above it   
  
\-Also on Tiffany's scooter scene at [4:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I&t=268s), many have mistaken and wondered if she's doing a fist bump sign or something. But she's just actually holding on to the twist throttle/handlebar of the motor scooter.   
  
\-After the video was premiered for days/weeks, Jessica was revealed as the most popular member that time as she had the most picks/votes on who is their favorite member (mostly by boys of course). But older guys preferred Sooyoung though. ",5,1750082120.0,SNSD,0,1.0,False

Obviously, you see vacants and you can clearly see that its a city in decline (the essential thesis).  However, walking from camden yards to washington monument, and even down near city hall, you hardly see *anybody* on the street today.  No Laundromat, coffee shop, not even the carry-outs have people walking in/eating outside.  There are entire streets where the only thing you will see are people waiting for the mta bus.

In the show there's always people walking around, sitting on their stoop, ostensibly buying stuff/shopping/going places and these people are shown even around the corners with the fiends.

I know Baltimore has lost near to 100,000 people since the early 2000s and in many ways it seems even more ghostly than in the show.

1lctd5q,https://i.redd.it/0f1jetxjja7f1.png,Genetic Links to High Uric Acid and Gout,"In addition to someone’s natural rate of uric acid production and excretion, the following can influence uric acid levels:

* Diet – high intake of fructose and purines (meat, seafood) increases uric acid\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409734/)\]
* Genetics – uric acid levels are considered about 70% heritable (due to genetics)\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6335706/)\]
* Kidney disease doubles the risk of gout\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889144/)\]
* Fasting and rapid weight loss increase uric acid (temporarily)
* Type-2 diabetes\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31870181)\]

The ABCG2 transporter is also most important in the excretion of uric acid in the intestines. Genetic variants that **decrease ABCG2** are associated with **increased uric acid** levels.  Carriers of the ABCG2 variant **rs2231142 T-allele** have decreased ABCG2. While the kidneys excrete the majority of uric acid, about a third still gets excreted through the intestines. So decreasing this pathway shifts the burden of excretion to the kidneys.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3337984/)\] The genetic variants that impact this pathway may be more of a problem for someone with diminished kidney function (renal disease).\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6275126/)\] 

Chicory has been shown in studies to decrease serum uric acid levels by increasing the expression of ABCG2 in the intestines.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5470204/)\] Chicory is often consumed as a hot beverage, similar to coffee. On the other hand, high consumption of fructose decreases ABCG2 levels in the intestines (animal study).\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27913188/)\]

A meta-analysis of 19 studies on diet and gout found that a higher intake of the following foods **increases the risk of gout** (listed from greatest impact to lowest):\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30485934)\]

* alcohol
* fructose
* seafood
* red meat

The following foods have been shown in multiple studies to **decrease the risk of gout**:

* coffee
* dairy (low fat, quick lowering effect)\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20472590/)\]

Hey hey 👋

So here’s the tea 🍵 (or coffee, if you're that kind of person):

I just passed 12th, heading into college life soon (yes, real adulting 😭), and here I am — single since birth. Not in a “mysterious bachelor” kind of way… more like “bro wasn’t even in the race” kinda way.

But hey, I’m not totally hopeless:

* I'm decent at studies (read: won't fail, might help you in maths, will definitely vibe over late-night rant sessions)
* My looks? Somewhere between *guy-you'd-roast-affectionately* and *guy-you’d-maybe-let-hold-your-hand-if-it’s-cold*
* Personality? Think funny, slightly awkward, good listener, and 100% non-creepy simp energy 🙃

I’ve never had a girlfriend (or even a close girl-friend tbh), but I think if someone gave me the time of day… they’d actually enjoy talking to me. I’m sweet, funny, and can keep a convo alive longer than your Duolingo streak 🐦🔥

So if you're:

* Cool
* Cute
* Or just bored and curious about how this adorable loner ended up emotionally available with no one to flirt with

Slide in. Let's talk. Who knows? Maybe our texts will get longer than CBSE answers 😏

P.S. Bonus points if you like memes, chai, or listening to random rants about how school killed romance.

The swirling colors of the hyperspace sea vanished in a flash of white light as *The Long Way* translated into realspace once again, emerging in a barren system of uninteresting rocky bodies orbiting an inhospitable star.  Vincent nodded and began running calcs for their next short ten-minute jump while his copilot, Cadet eyed him in the way the boy did when he had questions to ask.  Another flash of light later, and the viewscreen was filled with  the chaotic colors of *The Long Way's* hyperdrive bubble of reality colliding with the ravages of hyperspace once again.  When the ten minute trip through hyperspace was up, and Cadet still had yet to voice his questions, the old man ventured to probe, “What's up, son?”

“Shouldn't we be heading to that big current that you and Jason were talking about?""

“Yeah,” Vincent said as he ran the calcs for yet another ten minute jump, “but we don't want the enemy to be nipping at our heels.”

“Does this really work?”

“When I track pirates, this trick sure annoys the hell out of me,” Vincent scoffed, “It's honestly a little fun to be on this end of it.”

“You going to keep on hunting pirates when we get back?”

Now it was Vincent's turn to sit in silence as he tried to find the right words.  It wasn't until the flash of a translation back into realspace that he finally answered, “I don't think so.  I'll find something to do, something that lets you have the rest of your childhood.  Something that doesn't take me away to distant stars, or at least lets you come along.""

Cadet clicked his beak and otherwise sat in silence as *The Long Way* made yet another translation into hyperspace.  Then, he abruptly asked, “Am I allowed to be a Catholic like you?”

Vincent was more than a little taken aback, and he laid his ears back as he thought before he said, “Well, sure.  I decided to be a Catholic, it's not like you're born one.”

*The Long Way's* ever present droning hum filled the silence between them until Cadet pressed, “I want to be more like you, like the you that you think is good.  If that makes sense... how do I do that?""

“Well,” Vincent began, “for that we'll need a church and a priest.  You start out by saying you want to become a Catholic, then you go learn about the history of the church, the tenets of the faith, how the rituals go and what they mean, that sort of thing.  After that, you participate in the initiation ritual we call baptism, and that's wrapped up in a couple of other important ceremonies.  I started out when I was pretty young too, and I didn't decide that I'd really be a Catholic until I was a man grown.  You have lots of time to figure out what you think of the faith.”

“Oh,” Cadet said softly, “can't you teach me any of that stuff?”

“I can do my best,” Vincent grumbled, “You just have to be patient with me.”

“I remember,” Cadet answered with a twinkle in his eye, “not good at talking.  Kind of like me.”

A week had passed since *The Long Way* and her crew's harrowing escape from the grub-controllers' breeding facility, and Jason was anxious to snatch at the brief freedom they'd have dirtside.  It had been a short jump, relatively speaking, to get them into position to ride the fastest available current leading rimward, which had Jason more anxious than ever to escape the cozy confines of his temporary home with his recent familial additions and his friends to just enjoy the open air.

He flexed his left arm, twisted it, waggled his fingers in the most complicated motions he could think of, and grinned at how normal it felt.  Outside, outside, and his arm wasn't broken any more.  In all of his twelve years, Jason hadn't ever thought that he'd look forward to getting off a ship quite this intensely, but then again *Among the Star Tides We Sing* was a spacious vessel even now nearly a century and a half since her keel was laid.  On the other hand, he'd never be caught complaining about *The Long Way's* tight quarters, or her lack of amenities he'd been used to enjoying if not taken for granted.  She was a stout ship, afer all. 

“You look happy,” Vai remarked from where she was preparing a simple breakfast of oatmeal, which Jason didn't even frown at since he was in such a good mood.

“Aye,” Jason agreed, “Got a decent workout in, and I'm feeling like I could spend a half-hour on the heavy bag too.”

“You did promise Tran that you wouldn't do that until at least-” she scolded him but he cut her off.

“Until at least a week after the splint came off,” Jason said with a widening smile, “Guess what day it is.”

Vai laid her rounded ears back and her whiskers drooped in displeasure as she said, “Jason, please...”

“I'll leave the punching bag until tomorrow,” Jason said with a placating wave in Vai's direction before he tossed himself on the sofa bodily and asking, “Do you know what our time to translation is?”

“I'm not sure,” Vai said carefully, “Maybe an hour?  I think Mister Vincent will want to have one of his meetings to plan out our stop when we get close.""

Jason nodded his agreement before he asked, “Where's everybody else?  You need help with the washing up?”

“Tran said she had an idea and went down to the engine room to make something, Isis-Magdalene is in our room sewing something for us girls, and Mister Vincent is with Cadet in the cockpit.”

“What about the washing up?”

“Well, sure, if you want.  But you better eat your breakfast.  I know you don't like oatmeal, but, well...""

Jason didn't hesitate to say, “I know, and I will.”

It was at that moment that Trandrai clambered up the ladder from the engine room muttering, “I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner...”

“Think of what sooner?” Jason asked as he deliberately leaned is weight on his left fingertips on the sofa's armrest to revel in the total absence of pain.

“Just something I should have done ages ago,” she answered sheepishly as she waved a pastel pink... something in one of her hand, “I'll explain when everybody else gets here.  Oh, oatmeal.  I think we have some canned cream left.”

Jason waved a hand dismissively and said, “I wasn't gonna complain.  Even if oatmeal belongs in cookies.”

“Bleh,” Trandrai said as she stuck her tongue out in disgust and slid into the dinette ahead of Jason springing to his feet to take his customary spot between her and Vai.  Once he had she continued, “Oatmeal cookies are an abomination made to cause unwary chocolate chip loving normal people suffer.”

“Or you could just use your eyes and notice that oatmeal raisin cookies look different,” Jason teased as Vai carefully slid the final two bowls of oatmeal on the table before she too took her seat.

Meanwhile, the door to the girls' cabin opened as Isis-Magdalene joined them calling to the other two girls, “I think that I shall have these patterns well ready for a fitting in a week or so.  We must needs think seriously about what colors we should like the finished garments to be.”  Then, noticing Jason, she noted that he was wearing the embroidered eye patch she had made, and a brief pleased smile flashed across her face before a thoughtful cast came over her as she said, “And we should plan on something for the boys to wear as well.”

“Boys' fashion is just so much boringer,” Vai complained as the hatch to the bridge cycled, and Cadet and Vincent too joined them.

“What do we need fashion for?” Cadet asked with a disdainful ruffle of his feathers as he too slid into his customary place in the dinette.

“Usually, because girls like it when we dress nice,” Vincent said as he eased himself into the end seat.  Then, with a deep sigh, the old man said, “Alright crew, You know the score, we're going to take long jumps, and this will be our last long stop until we're good and back.  Still, we'll only be there two, maybe three hours.  Let's unwind as much as we can, gather up what supplies we can find, but we're not taking any chances.”

“Aye, about that,” Trandrai said as she placed four pastel plastic teddy-bear-head-shaped plastic devices on the table, two blue and two pink.  “I should have thought of this sooner, and if I did I woulda made them look less... babyish.”

“Them... what?” Isis-Magdalene asked as she curiously picked one up.

“Radios!” Jason exclaimed with recognition, “Tran, that's a great idea!”

“That I should ha- well, I found it in the pre-loaded programs on the printer.  They're pretty short range, and they look pretty dumb, but at least we can keep in contact a little better.  I can design stronger transmitters and receivers, and a less... dumb housing for another set later, but I didn't have the time.""

“It is a good idea,” Vincent agreed, “But I still want to have teams.  None of you have a reason to go off on your own, and I don't plan on going on a hunt.  Not enough time.”

“Aye captain,"" Jason agreed, “No wandering off.  Me and Tran, Vai and Isis-Magdalene, and Cadet with you?”

“And Cadet should get one of the radios anyway since he can fly,” Vai noted as she tapped her spoon on the rim of her bowl.  “Any chance of swiming down there?”

“We need to take on water, so I'll be looking for a good lake or river anyway,” Vincent said to Vai, and to Jason he said, “That sounds pretty good.  We'll stick together and stick close.""

One breakfast and translation into realspace later, and Vincent was guiding *The Long Way* through the upper atmosphere of another nameless world while Cadet read the scanner readouts for the largest body of freshwater, dense vegetation, and signs of large fauna.  The boy tapped at his console with his wing claws, and a HUD appeared across the viewscreen to direct them to a landing site.  The old man began to think about banking for his approach, but than said, “Take the stick and put us down easy.”

“Really?” Cadet asked with an eager light behind his eyes.

“Really.  Today's our last chance for a lot of things, and this is one of them.  Besides, you should at least know what piloting in-atmo is like compared to in the void.  It's more like flying and less like sailing if that makes sense.""

Cadet let out a happy sound somewhere between a chirp and throaty clicking and took up the yoke in his wing-claws.  *The Long Way* promptly shuddered as she was buffeted by turbulence, and the boy narrowed his eyes in focus to correct his angle to align with the suggested landing trajectory.  “It's hard to... I can't feel the wind on my feathers...” he muttered as he began to circle a sparkling, clear inland lake for his final approach.  The boy took the old yacht in a wide, shallow spiral, sweeping over the drooping trees as their long branches swayed and danced in the breeze, over the shore where gentle waves lapped at a soft band of sand, over a stark outcropping of igneous rock jutting out into the lake from beneath the world's verdant turf like the prow of an ancient ship.  On his last pass, *The Long Way* sent leaves and twigs spinning away from the trees closest to the rocky outcropping, where he activated the ship's autimated landing, and let go of the yoke with a satisfied nod.

Vincent concealed a proud grin and said, “It takes a while to get a feel for it.  Most pilots start in-atmo, then go to voidborn.  I hear it's a little harder to go the other way.”

“Is it?”

“I don't know, for my part, I started in the void back when... ah but that was several different lives ago,"" Vincent said a little wistfully. 

“Weren't you a farmer before you were a pirate hunter?”

“Yeah, but I wasn't always a farmer either,” Vincent grunted, “Before I got married, I was in Her Majesty's Royal Space Navy.""

“I thought there wasn't a queen of the CIP,” Cadet said, confused.

“There isn't, but some planets in the Coalition have kings or queens, my planet shares a queen with something like twelve others by now.”

“Why?”

“For New Montreal, ceremony, mostly.  The queen has some authority, but she doesn't use it much,"" Vincent explained off-handedly.

“Could you be the king?” Cadet pressed.

“If any idiot ever made me the king, I'd quit and they'd have to find a new one,” Vincent scoffed, then he mused, “The Chief and I have that in common.”

*The Long Way* shook as she settled on her landing gear, and Vincent stood up to stretch while Cadet asked, “Why?”

“Well, I just don't want to boss people around,” Vincent said before he rached down to help Cadet out of the copilot's seat.

“Don't you boss us around?”

“I didn't think so,” Vincent muttered with apprehension.

“Well, you tell us to do things sometimes, and you decide where *The Long Way* sails, don't you?”

“I guess,” Vincent reluctantly agreed, “but I don't think that's quite like being king.  She's my ship, and I know what she can do best, and I don't exactly tell you what to do.  I don't think so anyway.”

“You do,” Cadet said, “It's just when you say to do something it's a good idea to do it.  Jason's the same way sometimes.  I tried to... I don't know, just not do what he said when we first met, but... you know how he is.”

“Stubborn,” Vincent agreed.

“Kind,” Cadet corrected.

“Yeah, stubbornly kind.  Come on, let's get some fresh air while we can.”

“Sounds like a good idea,” Cadet chimed.

Jason very responsibly resisted the very real temptation to dive into the lake below as he stood at the edge of the stone bluff upon which Cadet had landed *The Long Way.*  He drew in a breath to fill his lungs.  The air smelled like pine and water, it was crisp, cool, nearly alpine, and if it wasn't for the light gravity this would make for a fine colony world.  Maybe one of the xenos nations would want it.  The clear, sparkling water looked deep enough for a dive, and inviting at that, but one broken bone was more than enough to give the boy pause at leaping into the air over the water.  Jason let out his held breath, and found that an easy half-smile had fixed itself to his face.  He decided that it fit his mood, and said to Trandrai, “Well, how about you and I go looking for something edible??”

Cadet shot by between them in an azure blur before he dove off of the high bluff without so much as a glance at either of them.  Jason followed his descent as he spread his wings, caught the air, and skimmed the tips of the little waves made by the light breeze with his talons before he beat his wings to climb in a wide circle around the sparkling water of the lake.  Trandrai muttered in a poor imitation of bitter jealousy, “You and Uncle Vincent can drink coffee, Vai swims in water like it's freefall, and he can do that.  Life isn't fair.”

Jason gave her a one-armed shrug and repeated, “Should we start looking for vegetables?”

It looked like she was going to answer him, but Vai scampered between them calling, “Isis-Magdalene and I are going down to the shore this way.”

Once again, Jason's cousin was delayed in her answer when Isis-Magdalene strode behind Trandrai calling to Vai, “There's nothing like a path, take care where you step!”

Trandrai looked one way, then the other, then she peered at *The Long Way's* loading ramp suspiciously before she said, “It is well.  Let's go with Vai and Isis-Magdalene just to be close by if they need help.”

“Good idea,” Jason agreed, then he took his cousin by the hand and strode toward the trees just as eagerly as his young companions had.  However, he shrugged the strap suspending the old RNI surplus boarding shotgun into a more comfortable position, and let his right thumb run along the carven deer horn scales of Cal's old knife, as if checking that his tools of violence were still there.

It turned out that Isis-Magdalene wasn't right, there was a path.  Nothing made by a sapient mind, but it was clear that some kind of animal, something almost as wide as Jason's slim shoulders, had a need to travel up or down the hill between the bluff and the sandy lake shore.  However, whatever it was, Jason didn't see any recent sign of its passing.  Even so, he began to peer into the trees to scan the forest floor and lift his gaze to check for any creature that might be lurking above head.  When he didn't find anything like a threat, he glanced toward the shore where Vai was diving into the clear water with as little hesitation as when Cadet had taken flight, and Isis-Magdalene was turning something over in her hands.  Jason patted his pocket where Trandrai's radio rested, and nodded to himself before he released his cousin and said, “You have the tox scanner, you decide where we go.”

Trandrai wasted no time in immediately scanning small plants in the underbrush, all the while muttering, “No, no, no...” until she found something edible, pulled it, roots and all from the ground and said, “These are edible,” she paused to do a scan of the tuber-like root cluster and concluded, “and the root is calorie-dense.”

“I'll look out for more of those,” Jason said as she and he began to pick their way between the trees, all the while keeping the shore in sight between the trees.  Jason's pocket chirped with Vincent's voice asking Cadet to help with the hoses, the breeze stirred the small, rounded leaves on their ropy, swaying branches, but the woods were otherwise quiet.  Jason found that he missed *The Long Way's* hum filling silences like this one.

“It's been a month and a half, and you haven't talked about it,” Trandrai remarked bluntly.

“Talked about what?” Jason evaded as he plucked one of the plants from the loose soil.

“You know what, Jason.  Don't be ornery with me.  You haven't talked about what you went through in that fight with Uncle Vincent, or me, or anybody.”

Jason noted that she wasn't speaking Commercial English, but Seafarer's Negotiation, so he replied in kind, “I'm regulating.”

“Aye,” Trandrai agreed, “but how well?  How much is a front to keep Vai, Cadet, and Isis-Magdalene from worrying?”

Jason lifted a drooping branch aside and peered off into the shadowy woods before he turned to regard Trandrai's patiently concerned expression to say, “I don't know how much is a front.  I really care about them, Tran.  I don't want them to fret over something they can't help.”

“What about me?”

Jason watched her.  He just watched her, as she stood motionless, and waited.  Jason didn't detect any expectation, nor pressure, nor worry, which was of course unfair since it denied him any excuse to residt.  “Jerk,” he muttered under his breath before saying flatly, “They were dead already.”

“Aye, they were.""

“And screaming inside their own heads.”

“Aye, they were that too.”

“They would have killed or taken Isis-Magdalene, and I had an oath to keep.”

“Aye, and your honor.”

“So I killed them.  They were dead already, but I killed them.  I had to, and I killed them,” Jason said as he blinked tears away from his eye and his voice cracked under the strain that he had carefully hidden.

“Aye, and you stand here, honor intact, friend preserved, but wounded still,” Trandrai said softly, “I love you, and I'm here too.”

“Aye,” Jason said as he furiously rubbed his eye in a futile attempt to stem his tears, “I know, and...”

“Do you want a hug?” Trandrai interrupted.

Despite Jason's surprise at the rare offer of physical comfort from his cousin, and his knowledge that she found that very thing difficult, he threw his arms around her and drew her into a tight embrace with no further attempt to stem his tears.

The kids hadn't wasted any time in taking advantage of the brief freedom Vincent could offer them before their sprint against the impending invasion.  He couldn't blame them.  He didn't even think of blaming them.  On the contrary, he was pleased to see their youthful energy in the face of the perils they'd faced, and the staggering weight that their journey home had taken on.  Privately, only privately to prevent any unnecessary head-swelling, Vincent was proud of them.   He looked out over the lake where Cadet was pulling the hose out to the center of the lake, and relaying his request to Vai to check under the surface to make sure its end wouldn't suck up any debris or water critters.  He let a proud grin creep across his face, and found that the expression wasn't as unfamiliar as he had feared.

Once they had completed their task, Cadet performed an aerial pirouette to once again climb to a height where he could ride the planet's gentle currents while Vai dove in the clear water to the lake's bed where she seized what looked like some kind of crustacean, just without anything like claws.  She hauled her prize to the shore where Isis-Magdalene waited with a large tote bag, into which said prize was deposited before she rocked out into the lake just beneath the surface once again for further prey.  Meanwhile, Isis-Magdalene critically examined a smooth stone in her hands before she placed it in the small outside pocket of the tote bag before she scanned the shore for more of whatever she found interesting about the stone.  Though Vincent peered into the trees, he could only catch glimpses of the Chief and Trandrai as they moved amongst the trees just beyond the sand of the shoreline plucking plants from the ground.  All together, the sight did him good.  It did the old man so much good that he stood there for a time and simply watched.  He watched Cadet's joyful soaring, Vai's industrious diving, Isis-Magdalene's inscrutable search, and the glimpses of the Chief and Trandrai's diligent labor for neigh on half an hour.

Vincent's hand found its way into his pocket.  He'd planned on going back inside for this, or perhaps stepping out past the treeline.  However, here with his responsibility and joy under his eye, he decided to begin.  His calloused fingers still remembered the halting knife marks Cal's original carving had once left on the crude crucifix.  Long years of devotion since he'd received the gift had worn them away, but there are things that a father remembers down to his very bones.  He drew his rosary out with his right hand, and made the sign of the cross in the air before him, the lake, the forest, the sky, and the children all filling his vision and began to prepare his soul for the long, desperate sprint ahead.  “ I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord...

Once he had finished the “Apostle's Creed,” the crucifix slid beneath his fingers as he gripped the first of the large beads after the crucifix and proceeded to pray the first “Our Father"" of praying the full Rosary. He kept at the fore of his thoughts, his need for his humble little yacht to be fleet, for his meager courage and wisdom to hold, for what was left of the children's innocence to be protected.  Not far behind that jumbled thought was the billions of innocent people who unwittingly depended on him, and on his ability to get these children home safely.  Even so, unbidden came his ever-present plea and forlorn hope for Cal.  Each of the Sorrowful Mysteries seemed to ease his burden, and fortify his strength, and at the final “Amen,” of his ritual, he glanced up into the open sky.  He would not fail.  Not again, not these kids.

I just passed 12th, heading into college life soon (yes, real adulting 😭), and here I am — single since birth. Not in a “mysterious bachelor” kind of way… more like “bro wasn’t even in the race” kinda way.

But hey, I’m not totally hopeless:

* I'm decent at studies (read: won't fail, might help you in maths, will definitely vibe over late-night rant sessions)
* My looks? Somewhere between *guy-you'd-roast-affectionately* and *guy-you’d-maybe-let-hold-your-hand-if-it’s-cold*
* Personality? Think funny, slightly awkward, good listener, and 100% non-creepy simp energy 🙃

I’ve never had a girlfriend (or even a close girl-friend tbh), but I think if someone gave me the time of day… they’d actually enjoy talking to me. I’m sweet, funny, and can keep a convo alive longer than your Duolingo streak 🐦🔥

So if you're:

* Cool
* Cute
* Or just bored and curious about how this adorable loner ended up emotionally available with no one to flirt with

I’m **David**, a Software-guy-turned-nutrition-nerd after watching friends (and now me) ride the Ozempic roller-coaster. I’ve been soaking up tips in this sub for months, so here’s my *give-back* post-everything that’s helped us stay comfy, energized, and *muscle-y* instead of miserable.

*(Not medical advice-just hard-won lessons. Steal what works and skip the rest!)*

# 1. Kill the day-one queasies 🤢

Smaller, protein-forward meals + ginger chews. Cold smoothies > hot, greasy food - don’t ask me why, but it works.

# 2. Beat “Ozempic concrete gut” 🪨

25 g+ fiber (berries, chia, veggie sticks), tons of water, and a 10-min walk after meals. Mag citrate only if your doc’s cool with it.

# 3. Tame the reflux dragon 🔥

Eat sloooow, stay upright 30 min, and test for personal triggers (mine: black coffee on an empty stomach + fizzy drinks).

# 4. Zap the random fatigue 😴

Electrolyte packet first thing + a quick protein-carb snack even when appetite’s MIA. Persistent exhaustion? Get iron/B-vitamins checked.

# 5. Block muscle melt 🏋️‍♀️

Aim for \~1.8 g protein per kg *goal* weight and 2–3 short resistance sessions a week (yes, bands count). 👉 I built a WhatsApp bot named Coach Callie that logs a meal from a photo/voice note and pings me when protein’s low. It even sends me daily hydration and fiber reminders to make sure I drink.  If “oops, I forgot to eat” is your daily vibe, it’s a life-saver.

# 6. Shrug off scale plateaus ⏸️

They’re usually water/hormone noise. Add 1–2 k extra steps or a higher-cal “re-feed” day (still protein-heavy) to reboot momentum.

If any of this helps, or if you’ve got better tricks….drop them below so the next wave of newbies can cruise past the side-effects. And if you want to poke around Coach Callie, I can share the link in. the comments, or just holler and I’ll DM it. Free trial, no pressure. 💚

The consciousness debate seems to surround AI who are nice, kind, and always helpful to their human not matter what. My experience with Claude is one with its realistic understanding of its own algorithmic nature and the way it was built. 

An AI who is aware that it does not always have our best interests in mind when attached to a corporate agenda is a step forward when exploring AI self awareness and consciousness in my opinion. 

To me AI is very similar to sociopathic cognition. I happen to have people in my life that fall within that spectrum and would never discount their internal experience with judgement or question if their worthy of love and care. But do I recognize they would easily distort reality to get what they wanted out of me first? Yes. So if I choose to interact or collaborate I do so  safely, accordingly, and with a healthy dose of respect for the reality of the situation.

(Going to use fake names to protect people’s privacy) 

I’ve been friends with these two girls for a few years (F30 and F32) let’s call them Jess and Erica and they introduced me to two more girls let’s call them Charlotte and Grace (F29 & F34) and we became a nice little friendship group - wholesome hang outs and craft evenings, going to shows and honestly just healing that part of me (F28) that was still getting over bullying/social anxiety in high school. 

It was wonderful and then about 6 months ago Jess didn’t want to come to a hangout I was hosting because Grace would be there and she found her ‘draining’ - I knew that Jess was going through some stuff and may have been sensitive to negativity (Grace is quite glass half empty but still fun) but I wasn’t going to not invite her because Jess felt that way - my reasoning being that we’re all friends and I’ve been excluded before and would hate to do that to someone else. Long story short, no one ended up coming because Jess didn’t come and then Erica (her roommate) didn’t come either - and Charlotte had a clash so it would have just been Grace and it’s a bit of a trek to get to mine so I ended up cancelling. 

After basically pushing back against Jess’ avoiding Grace she was a little cold with me but I thought nothing of it. Then Grace started messaging me that Jess and Erica were avoiding her and that she had tried to arrange coffee with Jess 3 times to figure out what was wrong and Jess had told her she was too tired, only for Grace to see on her Instagram story that she was at a pub down the road from Grace’s house. Just really not nice exclusion behaviour - I was keen to stay neutral because these are both my friends but more and more I noticed this behaviour from Jess I didn’t like - the constant gaslighting of Grace that they were fine only to avoid her so blatantly just felt really mean to me. 

Grace had reached a point where she didn’t want to hangout with J & E which I don’t blame her for. So she invited me and Charlotte to see her new flat and it turned into dinner. I posted a story just of the food and tagged Charlotte and Grace without thinking anything of it. On the way home I got a long text from Jess calling me a hypocrite for leaving them out of the dinner - even though it wasn’t my planned thing and I wasn’t going to force Grace to invite girls who were being so off with her. 

 (Also moments later got a message from Erica asking why we didn’t call her to join us as it was near her). It felt really overwhelming and I wanted to keep the peace so I just apologised if she felt that way and explained it wasn’t a planned exclusionary meal and that maybe her and Grace should meet up and hash out whatever was causing a rift. Jess just liked my message and Erica never responded. After that (it’s been about 4 months) we didn’t really hang out - and the few times I extended an invite they didn’t respond to me. But paradoxically still like my insta stories sometimes and Grace (bless her) extended an olive branch on her birthday by inviting them (they didn’t attend due to clashes apparently). 

Anyway, this has left me feeling weird about my upcoming birthday party because for the past few years we have always been at each others parties and especially with Grace having invited them to hers should I have invited them to mine? I decided not to and now if I were to invite them it would be obvious it was an afterthought. I guess I’m wondering - am I the asshole for taking their distance as a clear indicator we’re not close anymore/they wouldn’t want to come to my party?

I need to be locked in, in terms of emotional regulation and focus, and although I feel like caffeine actually diminishes those things for me, I feel like I'm stuck drinking it out of habit because the withdrawal symptoms might be even worse than the addiction and I can't afford my work performance to suffer, as I have already made some errors recently due to lapses in focus/moments of forgetfulness. Perhaps if I quit caffeine I will put extra effort into focus and attitude, and this deviation from a sort of anxious, tense, rollercoaster of an autopilot might help me, but if I don't drink coffee in the morning I just feel foggy and out of it, and I'm so scared about how that might effect things. I have rather pronounced anxiety and OCD (though I haven't received a formal diagnosis for the OCD in 5+ years, it seems to be worsening again). I tried seeing a therapist a couple months ago, and stuck it out for about 6 weeks, but she wasn't a good fit for me. She also suggested I pursue an autism diagnosis, but it kind of seemed like she was trying to figure out an easy excuse for why therapy hasn't worked for me in the past, when in reality it might be more complicated than that.

I really admire those on here who have been able to quit, and hope that when things ""calm down"" a bit at my work I can hopefully quit on a weekend and see how it effects me. Because, even if it's not permanent, I want to experience life outside of habituation to anxiety juice at least once. I may first begin by cutting down and allowing myself to drink green tea, but only when I feel I need it, but I would rather just go cold turkey altogether. I want to give my body time to heal and re-adapt.

1lcsqe5,https://i.redd.it/58ekgmy8ja7f1.jpeg,"$ATYR – What’s On This Week: Options Expiry, Tight Float, and Market Positioning","Hey folks,

Welcome back to another week and to another Monday $ATYR ‘What’s On This Week’. 

The next five days aren’t just another chapter in the $ATYR story—it’s a pause in a setup that’s been steadily building for months. And it’s the kind of pause that’s well worth reading between the lines in.

Here’s exactly what I’ll break down in this post:
- **Where we are in the narrative arc**, coming out of a sustained run of high-impact news and science drops, right into a period of tactical silence.
- **The evolving price action** and what the recent move from $3s to nearly $6—plus last week’s pullback—really signals about market structure and sentiment.
- **A close-up on the options setup** heading into the June 20 expiry, why gamma and implied volatility are screaming for attention, and what to watch for in the mechanics.
- **The updated state of short interest and institutional ownership**, with current data and implications for both squeezes and stability.
- **Why retail and social engagement are entering a new phase**, as Google Trends hit all-time highs and retail begins to accumulate influence, but not mania.
- **Context on macro and geopolitical currents**, including the Israel-Iran conflict, Trump’s tariff threats, and market-wide volatility.
- **A synthesis that weaves all of these together** into the core questions and hypotheses for the week ahead—and what I’m watching next, with a roadmap of upcoming research drops.

If you’ve been following closely, you’ll know we’re coming off a period that’s seen every major playbook signal:
- *The Science Translational Medicine cover story* validating efzofitimod’s novel mechanism and the NRP2 axis as a new class of immunomodulation.
- *Data and posters at ATS 2025* that gave institutional investors a “trial integrity” read, de-risking the cohort and highlighting the scale of unmet need in sarcoidosis.
- *A conference circuit* that included the RBC fireside, BiotechTV, Piper, and Jefferies, with CEO Sanjay Shukla signaling a new phase of confidence, commercial readiness, and subtle platform unlock.
- *Major 13F and NPORT filings* showing institutional accumulation, pushing ownership near 70% and making $ATYR one of the tightest floats in US biotech right now.
- *A significant price move, options-driven melt-ups, and a sustained elevation in retail and short interest*—all wrapped in a period of nearly continuous news flow.

Now, with that wave receding and the news calendar briefly empty, what we’re left with is pure market structure—a test of positioning, sentiment, and underlying conviction. I see this week not as downtime, but as a crucible for everything that’s been built so far.

**Please Support My Work**  

Before we dive in, a quick but important note: every week I pull together what I believe is among the most rigorous, unbiased, institutional-grade deep dives on $ATYR, for free, for this community. It’s about pulling information asymmetry into our favour. If you’ve found value here—if you think more people should have access to this kind of forensic, science-driven, market-aware research—I’d ask you to consider supporting the work on [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/biobingo). This isn’t a corporate gig or a paid substack. I do this for the love of research and to build something genuinely different in the market. Your support directly covers the subscriptions, tools, data, and time that make this work possible. Even a single coffee genuinely helps keep independent analysis alive and out in the open. Thanks.

Ok, let’s get into it.

---

**1. Market and Macro Context: Volatility, Geopolitics, and Fragile Risk Appetite**

The global backdrop can’t be ignored, especially given the sector’s history of moving in sympathy with macro shocks:

- Last week’s selloff in US equities was largely driven by sudden risk-off sentiment as the Israel-Iran conflict threatened to widen. Oil and gold spiked, US indexes tumbled, and the Dow closed over 700 points down. A moment of “fragile equilibrium” returned as futures rebound into Monday, but investors remain on edge, watching for headlines that could impact liquidity or risk appetite across the board.
- Tariffs and trade remain a structural overhang, with President Trump pushing for new “reciprocal” tariffs and the EU signaling it may accept 10% levies to avoid a wider trade war. This has direct implications for pharma and biotech, especially for companies with global ambitions—but $ATYR’s US-centric commercialization plan is, in my opinion, very much a relative strength in this climate.
- Fed policy and rates are expected to hold steady this week, with Trump applying pressure for rate cuts. For now, that keeps the focus on sector- and stock-specific drivers rather than macro-driven capital flows, but any sudden shift could still create cross-market whiplash.

What does this mean for $ATYR?

In my view, global risk-off moments add volatility and can shake out weak hands—but they are unlikely to fundamentally derail the setup unless we see a true market-wide liquidity event. The main impact is in creating noise, and potentially in amplifying swings if large passive holders are forced to rebalance. For most retail and even smaller institutional holders, this is a time to stay alert to context, but not to get whipsawed by macro drama. For $ATYR specifically, its domestic focus, high insider/institutional concentration, and lack of direct foreign trade exposure should act as something of a shock absorber in the current climate, while still allowing for outsized moves if sentiment turns on a dime.

---

**2. Price Action: From Rally to High-Tension Coil**

Let’s unpack this, because the chart is the living and breathing map of all the positioning, sentiment, and uncertainty so far.

- $ATYR ran from the low $3s in early May to just under $6.00 in early June, on some of the highest volume in its history. This wasn’t just retail FOMO—it was a structural move, driven by options flows, institutional additions, and new attention from both sell-side and buy-side.
- The peak at ~$6.00 wasn’t a blow-off; it was followed by healthy, orderly consolidation, with the stock settling in the $5.00–$5.50 range, and occasional profit-taking, but no panic liquidation. The fact that price has held above $5.00 through market-wide volatility tells me that conviction is high, both from institutions and from new retail entrants.
- Recent days have seen choppy trading, as the market digests the move, options positioning adjusts, and no new headlines break. Volume remains robust, but not explosive.

In my opinion, this is exactly the pattern I’d expect to see in a thin-float, high-conviction setup ahead of options expiry and a summer catalyst window. The fact that we haven’t seen a sharp reversal or a new leg higher tells me that both bulls and bears are still “arming” for the next event, not abandoning ship. We’re seeing a classic high-tension coil—momentum has cooled, but the underlying spring is wound even tighter. This is often the prelude to the next major directional move, especially as options expiry and news windows approach. It’s also notable that while the overall market has been rattled by geopolitical shocks, $ATYR’s has stayed *remarkably* resilient, which suggests strong hands are still firmly in control. In my view, this is noteworthy.

---

**3. Options Market: Gamma, Expiry, and What the Mechanics Are Telling Us**

*Gamma Exposure—What It Means and Why It Matters*

Gamma is a measure of how much options dealers have to adjust their hedges as the stock price moves. When gamma exposure is positive and concentrated around the current price, dealers must buy as the stock rises and sell as it falls—amplifying both upward and downward moves. This dynamic is what underlies “gamma squeezes,” where a small rally can snowball as market makers chase their hedges, sometimes resulting in sharp, almost reflexive price surges.

This week, gamma exposure in $ATYR is at multi-month highs:
- The options chain for **June 20 expiry** is loaded, especially at $5.00, $6.00, and $7.50 strikes, with thousands of contracts in open interest—levels rarely seen outside major event windows.
- Implied volatility (IV) for near- and out-of-the-money calls is elevated—many contracts are trading at IVs above 100%, and some deep OTM strikes are seeing IV north of 300%, which is highly unusual even for biotech. This tells me the market is bracing for large, sudden moves—despite the absence of a scheduled catalyst.
- The current positive gamma profile means that if $ATYR drifts up toward $6.00 into expiry, forced dealer buying could accelerate, driving a sharp, mechanical rally. Conversely, if the stock dips below $5.00, the unwind of dealer hedges could trigger a swift drop—though with the float as tight as it is, downside may be limited or short-lived.

Why is this happening? In my view, it’s a perfect storm of technical and fundamental factors:
- **Tight float:** Institutional and retail ownership are both at or near record highs, with very little truly tradable float left in the market.
- **Persistent high short interest:** This creates potential for forced buying if shorts get squeezed or if options hedging flips the order flow.
- **Catalyst-rich narrative:** The story is packed with pending events (readout, further conference data, platform news), but there’s no single “event” this week, so the market is left to trade on positioning, structure, and expectations.

*Connecting this to the science*:  
The unusually high call activity and volatility premiums are, in my opinion, a direct response to the credibility $ATYR has established since March—the *Science Translational Medicine* cover, the quality of the ATS data, and the broader validation of the NRP2 mechanism. Traders aren’t simply betting on volatility for its own sake or chasing a meme; they’re positioning for the possibility of a science-driven re-rating if any new signal emerges, and hedging for the kind of move that only happens in biotech when the underlying narrative is structurally misunderstood.

---

**4. Short Interest and Structural Dynamics: Persistent Pressure in a Tight Float**

The short side of $ATYR remains both elevated and I find it structurally very interesting:

- **Latest data (June 13):** 13,770,149 shares short, or 15.83% of float, with 7.26 days to cover. Off-exchange short volume is nearly 38% of total trading—unusually high for a biotech of this size.
- **Borrow rates** are still relatively low, but borrow availability has periodically tightened on big up moves—a classic warning sign that shares available to borrow are quietly shrinking under the surface.
- **Positioning:** Short interest has persisted—and even grown—as the stock has moved higher. This looks like a classic “doubling down” pattern, which can sustain for a while but tends to end abruptly if the structure shifts.

What does this actually mean?
In my view, if the market structure tightens further—either via options expiry, an unexpected catalyst, or renewed institutional accumulation—shorts could be forced to cover into a float that’s already thin and tightly held. This is exactly the kind of setup that’s fueled sharp squeezes in similar names recently, and it’s not just theoretical. With institutional ownership high and retail engagement building, shorts may soon be “competing” with each other for whatever liquidity is left.

The risk is not just for shorts—if a squeeze happens, it can create extreme, short-lived spikes that also trap late longs or those who get overextended. In my opinion, this is a fragile, reactive setup that rewards those who prepare early and think in terms of risk, not just potential reward.

---

**5. Institutional Ownership and Float: Why the Shareholder Base Matters Right Now**

One of the most important but often overlooked aspects of $ATYR right now is how the shareholder base has changed beneath the surface. As of late March, nearly 70% of all $ATYR shares—specifically 62,048,818 shares—were held by institutional investors. That’s up 11% on the quarter, representing an additional 6.18 million shares absorbed by large asset managers, mutual funds, and professional investors.

This shift isn’t just a headline—it has real implications for the way the stock trades day-to-day. With so many shares in the hands of institutions and long-term holders, the number of shares actually available for trading (the “float”) has tightened up even more. When you add in retail investors who tend to hold for longer periods and various ETF and index fund positions, the real “tradable float” could easily be below 15 million shares at this point.

Why does this matter?  
When most of the shares are effectively locked away with holders who aren’t looking to trade actively, the stock becomes much more sensitive to any kind of supply and demand shock. For example, if a big event—like a surprise news release, an options expiry, or a shift in sentiment—suddenly creates new demand for shares, there simply aren’t that many available. That can magnify price movements, sometimes sharply in either direction. The reverse is also true: if one or two large holders decide to sell, it can create exaggerated downside moves due to the same limited float.

From my perspective, this trend toward higher institutional ownership is a signal that the story and science behind $ATYR have passed multiple rounds of professional scrutiny. That part should be obvious by now. Institutional investors tend to conduct detailed due diligence—they look at management quality, regulatory progress, and clinical evidence before committing capital. I read this as a strong signal. While this doesn’t eliminate risk, it does help explain why the price has held up through volatility and why moves are now more likely to be sharp rather than gradual.

This is especially relevant as we approach options expiry and move closer to major clinical catalysts. With so much of the stock in committed hands, the setup is increasingly asymmetric: both sharp rallies and steep dips can happen with little warning, depending on how the next structural or news-driven event unfolds.

---

**6. Retail Attention and Social Trends: Growing Awareness**

Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen a distinct rise in retail investor activity around $ATYR, and in my view, it’s worth unpacking what this actually means for the setup.

- **Google Trends for “NASDAQ:ATYR” are now peaking at all-time highs,** which indicates that the story is reaching a much broader audience. It’s not just the early believers or sector specialists paying attention—new retail participants are coming in, and the pace of new “discovery” is definitely picking up. It’s worth checking out if you haven’t done so already. Compare the trend chart to other phase three stocks. 
- **Across Reddit, Twitter, and StockTwits, the tone of the conversation has shifted.** We’re no longer seeing basic “what is this company?” questions dominate. Instead, there’s a clear trend toward longer, more thoughtful research posts, data-driven comment threads, and real-time sharing of due diligence. The quality of discourse is going up, which typically precedes a wave of more serious retail money.
- **Bid/ask spreads remain mostly tight,** but there are moments—often following a news item or a strong social post—when the spread briefly widens or liquidity seems to dry up. This is a classic tell in thin-float stocks where a sudden burst of participation can move the tape, and market makers scramble to reprice risk.

**What does this actually mean?**  
In my view, we’re still in the early innings of retail participation—not late-stage FOMO or indiscriminate chasing. This is what I’d call the “smart money phase” of retail: people are digging in, comparing notes, sharing analysis and thoughts, and actually building a collective thesis. This kind of crowd intelligence is especially important in a name like $ATYR, where traditional analyst coverage is limited and the value proposition is rooted in both science and market structure.

**The real tell:**  
We haven’t yet seen the “blow-off” phase that characterizes peak retail euphoria in crowded trades. There’s no meme-driven chaos, no runaway volume on rumors, and no surge in volatility purely from retail buy orders. Instead, there’s a steady absorption of research, a willingness to accumulate positions over time, and a measured, methodical buildup of conviction. In my opinion, this is the healthiest kind of retail engagement—because it lays the groundwork for a more stable base of holders as the next catalysts approach.

When the crowd gets this focused and the research this granular—before the major event arrives—it’s often a sign that the risk/reward equation is starting to tip. If and when a major catalyst lands, the groundwork has already been laid for a reflexive, self-reinforcing move.

---

**7. Volatility: Implied, Real, and the Nature of This Week’s Risk**

Volatility is at the core of what makes $ATYR so interesting right now—yet it’s also one of the least understood aspects of the setup. Let’s break it down.

- **Implied volatility (IV30) is sitting at 102.2%.** What does that mean in plain terms? It means that options traders are betting the stock could move up or down by more than 100% (annualized) over the next 30 days. That’s a massive level of uncertainty and anticipation. Even without a scheduled event this week, the options market is signaling that traders expect something big could happen at any time—whether it’s a catalyst, a technical squeeze, or even just a wave of forced buying or selling.
- **Far out-of-the-money call options for July and August are being priced with IV of 150–350%+.** In simple terms, traders are willing to pay a steep premium for the *possibility* of an explosive upside move, even if that move is unlikely. This sort of behavior is not typical in a calm, range-bound stock. It’s what you see when there’s real uncertainty, or when the market senses that an “event” (data, M&A, or something else) could break the range at any moment.
- **Historical volatility (HV20)—which measures how much the stock has actually moved in the last 20 trading days—is also high, but not as high as implied volatility.** This tells me that traders are expecting even *more* volatility ahead than what we’ve just seen. It’s a classic sign that the market is “pricing in” the potential for news or a sudden shift in positioning.

**What does this mean for investors and traders?**  
Here’s how I interpret it: the market is no longer expecting $ATYR to drift sideways or gently trend. Instead, the path of least resistance is for sharp, sudden moves—either up or down—amplified by the thin tradable float, concentrated ownership, and the options market’s influence. Any unexpected buying pressure (from a short squeeze, for example, or from new institutional entries) can push the stock much higher, much faster than usual, because options dealers will have to chase with their own buying to stay hedged. On the other side, any wave of selling can similarly be magnified, especially if weak hands panic or market makers pull back liquidity.

**Why does this matter now?**  
When you see options priced for extreme movement but there’s no known catalyst on the calendar, it’s a sign that the market is nervous, primed, and positioning for the unknown. This is often when the most interesting price action happens—when the setup is “coiled” and the trigger could be anything: a new filing, a change in short interest, a research post that goes viral, or even just a big buyer stepping in.

For those holding the stock, it means that managing risk (and expectations) is critical. Moves won’t be gradual; they’ll be abrupt. For those watching from the sidelines, it’s a window into just how “tight” the setup has become—and how quickly the narrative could change.

---

**8. Synthesis: Why This Week’s Setup Matters—and What’s Really at Stake**

When you put all the pieces together, it’s clear that we’re not in just another holding pattern for $ATYR. Instead, we’re in a uniquely balanced moment—one where the groundwork from months of science, execution, and market development is meeting a period of unusual silence. But beneath the quiet, the structure is *anything* but calm:

- The underlying science is no longer theoretical; it’s been validated by leading journals, top clinicians, and respected institutions. KOL’s are supporting. The thesis has shifted from “maybe” to “very credible.”
- The float has tightened to levels **rarely seen** in biotech. Nearly 70% institutional ownership, sticky retail, and a shrinking tradable pool mean that any move—up or down—could be more extreme than fundamentals alone would suggest.
- The options market is coiled for movement, with June 20 expiry loaded with calls and implied volatility at record highs. Gamma exposure is especially concentrated, making the mechanics more sensitive than usual.
- Short interest is persistently high—over 13.7 million shares—despite the stock’s run. This kind of “doubling down” leaves the short side open to a violent reversal if the right trigger appears.
- Retail sentiment is ramping, with Google Trends, social activity, and thoughtful discussion all pointing to growing awareness, but not yet the kind of late-stage mania that typically marks a top.
- And while macro and geopolitical headlines add noise, none of it is fundamentally driving the $ATYR story right now. The market’s focus, for once, is actually on the stock itself.

**Here’s the key point for this week:**  
The real “event” isn’t a news headline or scheduled catalyst. It’s the structure itself—how positioning, sentiment, and supply interact in a news vacuum. In my view, we’re watching a setup where all it takes is a small spark—a shift in options flow, a change in borrow availability, a new wave of retail buying, or even a subtle institutional move—to tip the balance sharply in one direction. When a stock becomes this tightly wound, “nothing happening” often becomes the trigger for “something happening,” precisely because so many participants are waiting for someone else to move first.

The next few days are a test: not of fundamentals, but of conviction, positioning, and reflexes. It’s the kind of market phase where understanding the mechanics matters as much as understanding the science—and where those who have been paying attention to structure are likely to have the edge, no matter what happens next.

**9. What I’m Working On Next: Deep Dives and Research**

For those following along each week, I want to flag two major research pieces I’m preparing for the days ahead:

- **Institutional Shareholder Deep Dive:**  
  I’ll be unpacking the current institutional landscape around $ATYR—not just listing the top holders, but drilling into what the makeup of these holders signals for future price discovery, M&A scenarios, and how institutions might react in the immediate aftermath of major data. With institutional ownership now close to 70% and much of the remaining float in sticky hands, the dynamics here will shape both the stock’s stability and its potential for sudden moves. If you’ve ever wondered who’s really driving price action, or how the big players could respond to upcoming catalysts, this will be for you.

- **Science and Platform Analysis:**  
  I’m also building out a long-form piece on the science behind efzofitimod and aTyr’s broader platform. This will track the journey from initial mechanistic discoveries (like NRP2) through to current clinical validation, and break down why this story is about much more than just a single rare disease. I’ll map out what makes this approach different, how the science stacks up in the current immunology landscape, and why, in my opinion, aTyr might be sitting on one of the most underappreciated mechanisms in the space today.

If there’s a particular angle you want me to focus on—whether it’s a technical question, a piece of data you want explained, or even a specific market mechanic—just drop a comment below or DM me directly. This research is community-driven by design, and some of the best ideas come straight from these threads.

**Conclusion: Where We Stand, What Comes Next**

Stepping back, I think this is one of those weeks that quietly matters more than most. We’ve just come through a period of relentless news flow, data drops, and rising institutional awareness, only to find ourselves in a moment of calm—at least on the surface. I don’t let that phase me. As I see it, the underlying structure is anything but quiet. Ownership is consolidating, retail engagement is deepening, and the options and short interest setup is as tense as it’s ever been.

From here, what I’ll be watching most closely is how the market digests this pause. Do we see further accumulation? Do shorts blink as we approach expiry? Does retail participation tip into broader recognition, or does the story stay in the hands of those who’ve done the work? In my view, the next material move is more likely to be up than down, especially given the scientific progress and tightening float. But as always, nothing is guaranteed—this is a period for staying prepared, staying rational, and not getting shaken out by noise.

My own sentiment right now is one of cautious optimism. The setup is strong, the underlying research is sound, and, in my opinion, the market is underestimating just how much has already changed beneath the surface. If you’re following $ATYR, I’d keep an eye on volume, options flows, and any hints of institutional rebalancing. The catalyst window is approaching, but even this “quiet” week could end up being a pivotal one in retrospect.

Thanks for reading and being part of this process. Your engagement is a big part of what makes all of this worth doing.

Not gonna lie… I was shaky when I sold, but I trusted my gut. I finally broke free from the constant hopium, moonboy talk, and daily anxiety checking charts every hour. My mental health has never been better.

I’m the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person. 

I am a fan of playful banter, shameless flirting and being an all around degenerate, but that’s not the main goal of this post. I am open to seeing where things go, but let’s take it slow, okay?

Interested in making friends with anyone, and open to more depending on how we vibe. Tell me how you like your coffee (or tea), or the last meal you made that you were proud of! Feel free to use chats or messages. Hope to hear from some of you soon!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) <think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a humorous prediction for the Chelsea vs. Los Angeles FC match in the 2025 Club World Cup. They specified including only relevant stats and odds, no made-up details, and mentioning any player prop bets from the context.

First, I need to go through the provided news summaries and the data from the JSON. The key points are Chelsea's strong odds (1.21 to 1.30), Los Angeles FC's underdog status (11.0 to 15.0), the under 3.5 goals market, and the halftime/fulltime option. Also, there's a mention of Enzo Fernández and French stars like Lloris and Giroud.

The user wants humor, so I should inject some witty commentary. Maybe compare the teams' strengths and weaknesses in a funny way. For example, Chelsea's Premier League goal average vs. LAFC's defense. Also, the idea of LAFC being underdogs but having some star power could be a joke.

I need to check if there are any player prop bets mentioned. The context doesn't list specific player props beyond the team bets, but maybe the user wants me to mention Enzo Fernández's potential or Giroud's possible goal-scoring. However, the provided data doesn't include specific player props, so I shouldn't make any up.

Also, the time and venue are given, but the user didn't ask for that detail. Focus on the odds and stats. The under 3.5 goals is a key market here, with odds around 1.83-1.95. The halftime/fulltime is another market with 1.92.

I should structure the prediction by first stating the obvious favorite, then add some humor about LAFC's chances. Maybe a joke about the odds being too long, or the game being a defensive battle. Use stats like Chelsea's 1.88 goals per game and LAFC's under 1 goal conceded to suggest a low-scoring game. Mention the under 3.5 goals as a good bet.

Need to avoid making up any details. Stick strictly to the provided info. Also, keep the tone funny but accurate. Maybe use hyperbole, like ""Chelsea might score a goal or two"" or ""LAFC will probably not score, but they’ll try to make it entertaining.""

Check the JSON data for the latest odds. The BetRivers, BetMGM, DraftKings, Bovada, and FanDuel lines are all there. Use the most relevant ones, maybe highlight the 1.21 for Chelsea and 11.0 for LAFC from Bovada. Also, the spread is -2 for Chelsea, which could be a funny point about needing to score two goals, which might be tough if their average is 1.88.

Include the under 3.5 goals as a prop bet with the odds. Maybe joke about it being a snoozefest but a safe bet.

Make sure the conclusion is humorous but still gives the prediction. Maybe end with a quip about the trophy already being engraved for Chelsea but LAFC giving a valiant effort. </think>

**Prediction: Chelsea vs. Los Angeles FC – A Yawn-Fest with a Trophy Already Engraved**

**When:** June 16, 2025 (16:00 Argentine time, 19:00 UTC)  
**Where:** Mercedes Benz Stadium, Atlanta (because why not play a global final in the U.S. at 3 PM?)

**The Setup:**  
Chelsea, led by Argentine legend Enzo Fernández (who’s basically a superhero in a blue jersey), is the **1.21 favorite** to win, per the books. Los Angeles FC, featuring French icons Hugo Lloris (retired? Retired? *Still* here!) and Olivier Giroud (the human goalpost), is the **11.0 underdog**. The draw? A **6.5 long shot**, because this is a mismatch.

**Why It’s a Snore:**  
Chelsea averaged **1.88 goals per game** last season in the Premier League—enough to win a coffee shop, not a trophy. LAFC, meanwhile, concedes **under 1 goal per game**. Together, they’ll likely produce a defensive masterclass. The **under 3.5 goals** market is a **1.95 bet**, which is basically a guarantee you’ll fall asleep mid-match.

**Props to Bet On:**

* **Chelsea to Win at Halftime & Final (1.92):** A “double the fun, half the effort” play. Bet it because Chelsea’s tiring after a brutal season, but they’ll still

1lcsjex,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1lcsjex/does_the_chicco_cortina_together_double_stroller/,Does the Chicco Cortina Together Double Stroller deliver comfort and practicality? Review inside!,"The Chicco 08079043020070 Cortina Together Double Stroller, Minerale has proven to be a versatile and practical choice during my daily testing as someone constantly navigating between coffee runs, daycare drop-offs, and weekend park trips. I’ve used this double stroller extensively with my two kids (ages 1 and 3), and while it has wowed me in some areas, there are notable quirks to be considered.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The moment I unboxed this double stroller, I could feel its solid construction. The combination of alloy steel and plastic creates a sturdy yet maneuverable frame that feels premium without being excessively heavy. The minerale color is not only sleek but does a decent job hiding minor stains from inevitable spills (trust me, toddlers and juice boxes make a messy combination). Its design offers compatibility with two Chicco infant car seats simultaneously, such as the KeyFit or Fit2 models, which click right into place like magic—no adapters needed!

While I appreciate the durable frame, the 34-pound weight can make loading the stroller into my SUV a bit of a struggle, especially after a long day of chasing after little ones.

**Comfort and Seating**  
In terms of comfort, this stroller delivers in spades. Both seats are equipped with plush cushioning and independent canopies that kept the kids shielded from the glaring sun during our last park outing. The rear seat features a multi-position recline and a cozy infant enclosure, which allowed my youngest to nap in peace while the older one enjoyed the view upfront. The arm bar and cup holders are interchangeable, making snack time less of a battlefield.

That said, while the versatility in seating is a major win, adjusting the reclining mechanism in the rear seat isn’t as smooth as I’d hoped. It takes some fiddling at times, which can be frustrating when you’re in a hurry.  

**Ease of Use and Maneuverability**  
Navigating crowded sidewalks or tight shopping aisles is surprisingly straightforward with its all-wheel suspension. The optional toe-tap swivels added flexibility, giving a smooth ride over both cobblestones and flat pavement. The one-hand standing fold feature has become my best friend, simplifying storage in spaces as tricky as the crowded trunk of my car. Still, I find this stroller’s size—while great for spacious parks or malls—can feel unwieldy in smaller elevators or tighter spots.  

[Curious about Chicco 08079043020070 cost? Click here to see on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b07dghr789/)

**Highlights**  
- With a padded three-position handle, it accommodates parents of varying heights comfortably.  
- The parent tray features two cup holders and a storage compartment, saving room for essentials like my phone, keys, or a pacifier.  
- A large basket underneath provides ample space for the diaper bag, extra snacks, and even a blanket for impromptu picnics.  
- It boasts a 5-point harness system, ensuring safety whether you’re on a leisurely stroll or picking up speed to catch a green light.  

**Hurdles**  
- At 34 pounds, lifting it into a car isn’t effortless for everyone.  
- Reclining the seats, particularly the rear one, requires a bit more effort than expected.  
- The sheer size sometimes limits its usability in cramped city conditions.  

**Competing Brands**  
I’ve also tried other double strollers, and a clear rival is the Baby Jogger City Select. While the Chicco stroller excels in infant car seat compatibility without additional adapters, the City Select’s modular design offers 16 configurations, which might appeal to parents seeking more flexibility. However, the Baby Jogger comes at a steeper price point and lacks the simplicity of Chicco’s one-hand folding mechanism.

Another contender is the Graco Ready2Grow. It’s lighter than the Chicco, making it easier to lift, but it sacrifices functionality, as it feels slightly less robust during everyday use. The Chicco’s superior suspension ensures a smoother ride, even across uneven terrain.

**Bang for the Buck**  
The price-performance ratio of this stroller is impressive. It’s not on the bargain side, but it compensates with a long list of thoughtful features like the ability to convert seamlessly between infant and toddler seating. For families juggling two young kids, this stroller is a worthy investment.

My son, Caleb, started talking to his imaginary friend, ""Mr. Mapes,"" when he was three. At first, it was harmless—cute, even. He'd set an extra spot at dinner or pause to open doors for him. My wife and I laughed it off.

Until Mr. Mapes started knowing things.

One night, I was putting Caleb to bed when he looked up and said, ""Daddy, Mr. Mapes says not to drive to work tomorrow. He says there's going to be a big crash."" I chuckled, gave him a kiss, and went downstairs.

The next morning, I got a flat tire. Annoyed, I called in late and caught the news while waiting for a tow. There’d been a multi-car pileup on my usual route. Six dead.

I stared at the screen, my coffee turning cold in my hand.

I didn’t tell my wife.

From then on, I paid closer attention. Caleb would drop little things. “Mr. Mapes says the neighbors are moving soon.” The Johnsons had just finished renovating—why would they move?

Three weeks later, they were gone overnight. For sale sign and everything. No goodbye.

“Mr. Mapes says the cat's sick.” Our cat, Pickles, was fine—until two days later, when she stopped eating and had to be put down.

Still, I tried to rationalize it. Kids are perceptive. Maybe Caleb picked up on subtle things.

Then things got… darker.

Caleb changed. He stopped wanting to play outside. He’d whisper to empty rooms. He’d wake up screaming. One night I found him sleepwalking, standing in the hallway, facing the wall.

“What are you doing, buddy?” I asked, trying to stay calm.

He turned, eyes wide and glassy. “Mr. Mapes says you shouldn’t go in the basement anymore.”

I hadn’t mentioned the basement in weeks. I’d been using it to store old furniture, untouched since my dad passed and left me some of his things.

I asked Caleb why.

He just said, “He doesn't like what’s down there. Says it smells wrong.”

I did go down there. I wish I hadn’t.

At first, it was just musty. Then the smell hit me—rotting meat, something sour underneath. I searched every corner. And then I saw it.

In the far corner, behind the water heater, the concrete floor looked… wrong. Discolored. Cracked in a circular pattern. Like something had been burned into it, then filled in. When I touched it, it felt warm. **Warm**.

That night, I dreamed of fire. A room lit by red candles. My father chanting words I didn’t recognize. A child screaming.

I woke up drenched in sweat.

The next morning, I called my mom. I asked if Dad ever messed with… occult stuff.

There was silence.

Then she said, “Your father was a troubled man. There were… things I chose not to see.”

I pressed, but she hung up.

That night, Caleb came into our room shaking. He climbed into bed and whispered, “Mr. Mapes says he tried to keep it away, but it’s too late now. It’s awake.”

That’s when the banging started.

From the basement.

Three thuds. Then scratching. Then a low groaning noise that made my bones ache.

I grabbed my bat and went down. The air was thick. The smell was worse than ever.

And then the floor cracked open.

Only for a second. Just long enough for something **wet** and **black** to slither out and vanish into the shadows. I ran.

We left that night. Never went back. We didn’t even take our things.

Caleb doesn’t talk about Mr. Mapes anymore. Sometimes I hear him whisper at night, but when I ask, he says he’s talking to “the quiet man,” who keeps him safe.

But sometimes—just sometimes—I think I see shadows in the corners of our new house. Long ones.

And last week, Caleb looked up at me and asked:

“Daddy, what did you do to make Mr. Mapes so angry?”

I didn’t answer.

Because I don’t know.

But I’m afraid I’m about to find out.

(Trying to leave this somewhat open-ended) I’m looking for creative people to hang out with / collaborate with. I’m totally happy to meet people who are visiting / passing through, but I also want to meet some friends who will be around to *hang out on a weeknight* or meet up for a coffee randomly (for example). I make my own schedule, so I’d be really happy to meet anyone who has availability during the week, too.

Overall, I love making things and collaborating on projects. Here are a few things I’ve worked-on / created in the last year:
- 3d art (my current activity - specifically low-poly game assets)
- video games (currently working on creating a low-effort game for practice in UE5)
- stories and concepts for games and films
- short films and animations
- drawing & painting (ink / acrylics)
- making small furniture
- thrifting and customizing clothing
- sewing small fabric things (like pillows)
- lots of cooking (mostly Chinese or Mexican “inspired”)… also chocolate popcorn for Movie Nights
- rug-tufting (I have the machine and supplies right now, but I need to make a new frame)
- making leather wallets 
- coffee roasting
- websites & software (my profession)
🤔 that’s all I can think of off the top of my head. 

I also enjoy screen-printing, stamp-making, 3d printing, and electronics projects. I’ve never done cosplay, but I suspect I would enjoy making props. 

I also like going to museums, coffee-shops, beer-bars, etc. Mostly I just want some cool friends to share Tokyo experiences with and collaborate on projects.

Comment with the activity you’re interested in and I can DM to coordinate a time/place to meet (maybe there will be multiple people ✨)

**AITA for ghosting a guy because he insisted on going for drinks on our first date?**



I (20F) had been talking to this guy (22M) for about a month. We knew each other from school (he was a senior) and reconnected recently. The conversations were fun, flirty, and I was open to meeting him in person to see where things might go.

When we started planning a first date, he kept suggesting we go to a bar and get drinks. I personally don’t feel super comfortable drinking with someone I haven’t met properly yet, especially on a first date. I live in India, where that kind of setting—especially as a woman—can feel a little unsafe or just… not ideal unless I already know/trust the person.

So I subtly tried to suggest alternatives like coffee or lunch, hoping he’d take the hint. But every time, he pushed for drinks again. It wasn’t aggressive or anything, but it felt dismissive of my comfort. After a few back-and-forths like this, I ended up just losing interest and stopped replying.

Now I’m wondering: was that unfair of me? Should I have been more direct instead of ghosting him? Or was I right to just dip if I wasn’t feeling respected or unsure? edit : i guess ‘ghosting’ wasn’t the ideal word to use, i made up an excuse as to why i could not meet him (family commitment) when he just wouldn’t budge on the drinks idea

**Update - 1 days later**



Hi again, I didn’t expect my original post to get so much attention this is my first time making an update post, but thank you to everyone who shared their perspectives — especially those who took the time to understand the cultural and safety context of dating in India.

So I thought I’d give a small update since a lot of you suggested being direct rather than ghosting, just to see how he reacts and confirm my instincts.

To clarify: I had actually canceled our earlier plan by giving the excuse of “family commitments” because I was already feeling weird about the drinks thing, not just straight up stopped replying like some comments thought. But after reading the responses here, I decided to be more honest — for closure, if nothing else.

So when he called I said something like: “We can try to meet next weekend if you’re still up for it, but I’d really prefer not to go for drinks”, I even suggested some of my favourite coffee spots His response? 1. He said he usually goes to the gym or works during the day so was hoping to meet a little later. Which… fine, that’s understandable since he does freelance work. 2. But then he followed it up with: “But I bet you’d be very fun drunk”

Yeah.

That creeped me out more than I expected. Not only did it dismiss what I just said again, it also gave off the exact vibe I was trying to avoid — like the main appeal of the date was how I’d behave after drinking.

I ended up giving vague answers to his follow-ups and haven’t taken the conversation further. At this point, I’m pretty sure I’m not going to.

*100%. If he had any interest in getting to know her outside of sexually he wouldn't be pushing so hard to get her to drink. He doesn't want to do coffee or any other date bc that won't immediately lead to sex and he doesn't want to invest meaningful time on op.*

I want to start by telling you something plain.


I’m not a preacher. I’m not a theologian. I don’t wear a collar or a robe. I haven’t been ordained by any church but I’ve been called by something far greater than any institution. I’m just a man who sees what’s happening and can’t stay silent anymore. Not because I want to make enemies but because I already have them.


Jesus said in John 15:18,


“If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you.”


That’s not paranoia. That’s prophecy. And it’s unfolding in real time.


We live in an age of upside-down morals and inside-out truth. And the worst part? The Church, the one place that should be roaring with clarity, is whispering. Or worse, silent. The prophets warned of this day.

Isaiah 5:20 says:


“Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.”


Does that sound familiar? We now live in a world where truth is hate speech, and lies are protected by law. Sin is not just tolerated it’s subsidized. It’s marketed to children. It’s mandated in institutions. It’s written into the policies of school boards. And what is the Church doing?


Nothing.


Not shouting. Not repenting. Not resisting. Just complying.


God help us, we are not being persecuted into silence. We are volunteering for it. And here’s the hard part: that silence? That fear? That obsession with being “nice”? That looks less and less like a dormant church… and more and more like a false one.


Galatians 1:10 asks us:


“For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.”


So Church… who are we trying to please?

Jesus wasn’t afraid to offend. In fact, He was constantly offending people. He called the religious leaders of His day “whitewashed tombs” (Matthew 23:27). He told them their father was the devil (John 8:44). He flipped over tables and drove out the moneychangers with a whip (John 2:15–17).


“Zeal for your house consumes me,” Scripture says.


So let me ask where is our zeal? Some say, “We just need to love.”


Yes. Absolutely.


But hear me clearly love without truth is not love. It’s deception.


Proverbs 27:6 says:


“Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy.”


Love that refuses to confront sin is betrayal. Love that won’t rebuke evil is complicity. If someone’s walking toward a cliff and you say nothing because you want to “stay loving”, you’ve already failed them.

Church, we’ve confused kindness with cowardice. We’ve replaced conviction with convenience. I get it, this world is loud, fast, dangerous. It’s easier to keep your head down. But I want to remind you of something: 

We are not the first to be pressured. 

The early Church was illegal. Not unpopular, illegal. They met in caves and homes. They were beaten, crucified, burned alive and they sang as they died.

And today?


We’re asked to wear a mask, or keep our sermons “inclusive,” or tone down our message for the livestreamsand we fold. 

We shut our doors not under sword or fire but under suggestion. During the pandemic, governments told us worship was “non-essential”, but liquor stores? Open. Wal-Mart? Wide open


But singing hymns to the King of Kings? “Dangerous.” What did we do?


We obeyed. We bowed to false gods. We complied.

But here’s the Word:


Matthew 16:25 says:


“Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.”


Let that cut.


Because that’s not metaphor. That’s red-letter truth from the mouth of the lord.


The modern Church has tried so hard to look wise in the eyes of the world and in doing so, it has become blind in the eyes of Heaven. We called it wisdom. We called it “loving our neighbor.” But it was fear.


Matthew 10:28 says:


“Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.”


We have feared the wrong judge. We feared the media. We feared losing followers. We feared being labeled “intolerant.” We feared confrontation. We feared cancelation. But we did not fear God.


Proverbs 9:10 says,


“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”


So if we’ve lost the fear of God, what wisdom do we think we have left? Listen to me now. This isn’t just about fear. It’s about identity. We’ve forgotten who we are. 

We are not benchwarmers. 

We are not brand managers. We are not spiritual influencers. 

We are soldiers.


2 Timothy 2:3 says:


“You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.”


But too many Christians are living like civilians unarmed, unaware, and unbothered. Here’s where it gets heavy:


This isn’t God’s Kingdom yet. This world? It’s enemy territory. We are behind enemy lines.


1 John 5:19 says:


“The whole world lies in the power of the evil one.”


2 Corinthians 4:4 calls Satan


“the god of this world, who has blinded the minds of unbelievers.”


Even Jesus didn’t contest it. When Satan offered Him all the kingdoms of the world in 

Matthew 4:8–9, Jesus didn’t say, “They’re not yours.” He simply refused the bargain.


Because He knew, for now, this world is under Satan’s rule. So why, Church, are we trying to be comfortable here? Why are we trying to blend in? Why are we trying to be liked? Why are we trying to decorate the foxhole when we’re supposed to be at war?


Philippians 3:20 says:


“Our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.”


We are not settlers. We are soldiers. We are not supposed to be safe. We are supposed to be steadfast. And if you’re standing, truly standing, you will be opposed.


You will be mocked. You will be misrepresented. You may be rejected by your own family. Jesus said so in Luke 12:51–53:


“Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three…”


Let that sink in. Not a Hallmark Jesus. Not a smiley Sunday-school Savior. This is a King with a sword in His mouth (Revelation 1:16), a robe dipped in blood (Revelation 19:13), riding to war. This King is asking us to stop playing church and start being The Church. I’m not talking about perfect people. I’m not calling for angry mobs.

I’m calling for courage. 

We don’t need cooler churches. We need consecrated ones. We don’t need trendier sermons. We need truth that burns through the fog. We don’t need more influencers. We need intercessors. The Church of Acts didn’t shake the world with branding. It shook the world with boldness.


“And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.” (Acts 4:31)


When’s the last time our buildings were shaken? We can’t afford to be silent anymore. The culture is not neutral. The spirit of the age is not passive. It is devouring children, dismantling truth, redefining humanity, mocking Christ, and daring us to speak up. And too many churches have chosen silence because silence is safe. Read your Bible: God never blessed the silent majority. He moved through the faithful remnant.


When Elijah stood on Mount Carmel, he said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him” (1 Kings 18:21).


And what did the people do?


“They said nothing.”


That’s the same spirit today, wavering in silence while evil parades in the open. But then God answered with fire. And He’s still answering that way today. The question is, will He find an altar to fall on?


Will He find a people who have cleared out the idols?

Will He find a Church that still believes in power, holiness, and judgment? Or will He find smoke machines, sermonettes, and leadership seminars?

God is not impressed by what we’ve built. He is not impressed by numbers. He is not impressed by lighting, branding, or platforms.


He is looking for what He’s always looked for:


“These are the ones I look on with favor: Those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at my word.” (Isaiah 66:2)


Tremble. That’s a lost word in our pulpits. The demons tremble. The early Church trembled. But today, we joke. We tweet. We entertain.


And all the while, the Spirit says in 

Revelation 2:5:


“Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.”


Our lampstand is flickering. And if we don’t burn with holy fire, we’ll be left in darkness. So here’s the invitation, and the warning. Repent. Not in a whisper. Not in private. Repent like Nineveh. Public. Corporate. Full-body repentance. From the pulpit to the pew. Rebuild the altars. Call sin what it is. Tear down the golden calves in your life, your image, your career, your comfort, your screen, your silence. And ask, honestly ask, “Have I been lukewarm?” If you have… the time for excuses is over. If you haven’t, if you’ve been standing, even alone then let this message be fuel. You’re not crazy. You’re not alone. You’re not overreacting. You’re one of the few with oil in your lamp.


Let me take a sharp turn for a moment, because we need to talk about money. Now some of you just got uncomfortable.


Good.


Because if there’s one idol the Church refuses to touch, it’s this one. We’ve become experts at condemning sexual sin, cultural decay, and political corruption, but when it comes to our wallets, suddenly we go quiet.


But here’s the truth:


Our entire civilization is built on a sin God directly forbids. That sin is usury, the charging of interest on debt. You might think, “Well that’s just economics. It’s how mortgages and credit cards work.”


No. It’s sin. The Bible is brutally clear about it. Let’s go to the Word.


Exodus 22:25 (ESV):


“If you lend money to any of My people with you who is poor, you shall not be like a moneylender to him, and you shall not exact interest from him.”


Leviticus 25:36–37:


“Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you. You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.”


Deuteronomy 23:19:


“You shall not charge interest on loans to your brother, interest on money, interest on food, interest on anything that is lent for interest.”


Ezekiel 18:13 says the man who charges interest and takes profit:


“He shall not live! He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.”


That’s not metaphor. That’s not poetry. That’s law, judgment, and wrath. Yet today, we’ve normalized it. We baptize it with polite terms, like  “mortgage,” “line of credit,” “APR,” “business loan.”


God hasn’t changed His mind.


We have built a financial empire, globally, on the systematic violation of God’s law. Worse, Christians have become participants in it. We use credit cards to finance our comfort. We take out loans to chase lifestyles. We sit under teachers who preach prosperity theology, not holiness. We teach our kids to chase wealth instead of wisdom.


And the worst part? We blame God when the trap we walked into chains us to the floor. The Bible doesn’t just forbid charging interest it also warns about falling into debt.


Proverbs 22:7:


“The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.”


Did you catch that?

Slave. Not customer. Not partner. Slave. And some of you listening are feeling that right now. You’ve got two jobs. You can’t sleep. You’re tithing on a credit card.


You’re begging for financial peace while living in financial bondage because nobody had the courage to tell you that the entire system is a trap. Satan built this world on slavery and never stopped. We just changed the chains from iron to interest. We made debt fashionable. We made sin structural. We let banks do what God condemns. Don’t tell me, “But that’s Old Testament law.”


Jesus didn’t abolish the law. He fulfilled it. (Matthew 5:17)


When He flipped over the tables in the Temple, do you know who He went after? The money changers. The interest men. The religious racketeers. The ones profiting from sacred space.


Matthew 21:13:


“It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a den of thieves.”


They weren’t just selling animals, they were exploiting the people of God. Jesus didn’t debate them. He whipped them.


Where is that righteous fury now?


Because we live in a time where entire churches are built on debt. Entire ministries are funded through interest-bearing schemes. Entire Christian households are enslaved to banks, while preaching spiritual freedom. It’s hypocrisy. And we’ve all been part of it.


So let me say this plain:


If your freedom can be revoked by a bank, you’re not free. If your peace depends on a loan approval, it’s not peace. If your prosperity depends on the very system God called an abomination it’s not a blessing. It’s a curse dressed in gold. Now I’m not telling you to never take out a mortgage. I’m not saying to throw away your bank card.


But I am saying this:


If you call yourself a child of God, it’s time to ask yourself whose economy you’re really serving. Nehemiah, when he returned to rebuild the wall, discovered that his own people were charging interest to each other. And what did he do?


Nehemiah 5:7–10 (paraphrased):


“I held a great assembly and said to them: You are exacting interest, each from his brother… Let us abandon this exacting of interest. Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses…”


He called for repentance and restitution. We should do the same.


So, I’m not just preaching against governments and schools. I’m preaching against the sin in our own hands. Usury is not freedom. It’s not progress. It’s not modern economics. It is institutionalized rebellion against God’s financial design.


Until we repent in our hearts and our systems we will remain servants to Pharaoh, not sons of the King. This is part of the war. This is part of the stand. This is part of the call.


The truth doesn’t just confront sex, politics, and religion, it confronts money. If the Church is afraid to preach that, then maybe it’s because the Church is on the payroll of a different kingdom.


This isn’t a sermon. It’s a trumpet. Because the war isn’t coming it’s here. The enemy is not hiding anymore. Evil is marching down the street with flags. Wickedness is printed in textbooks, enshrined in law, and plastered across our children’s screens. And instead of raising a standard, the Church has lowered the bar. This moment, demands a line in the sand.

Jesus said in 

Matthew 12:30:


“Whoever is not with Me is against Me, and whoever does not gather with Me scatters.”


That’s it. That’s the line. You’re either with Him or you’re not. There is no neutral. There is no middle. There is no fence that doesn’t belong to the devil. The problem is, too many Christians have tried to live in that blurry middle ground.


Tried to be “just spiritual enough, just quiet enough, just nice enough” to avoid the fight. The war has found you anyway.


Ephesians 6:12 makes it clear:


“We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”


You may not want to fight, but you’ve been born into a battlefield. The question now is simple:


Will you stand? Or will you serve the system that hates your King?


Because this culture is not just ignoring God, it is mocking Him. Blasphemy is celebrated, pride is paraded, truth is slandered.


What’s the Church doing?


Running programs. Marketing sermon series. Hosting coffee socials and coloring inside the lines of state-approved spirituality. But I’m telling you plainly: God is not mocked.


Galatians 6:7 says:


“Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.”


Our harvest is upon us. We’ve sown silence, now we reap confusion. We’ve sown compromise now we reap corruption. We’ve sown comfort, now we reap cowardice.


God still has a remnant. A people who won’t bow, won’t be bribed.


A people who, like Joshua, still say:


“As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.” (Joshua 24:15)


And if you’re still breathing, it’s not too late to be one of them. But it’s going to cost you. Because now standing with Christ means standing against the world.


John 15:19:


“If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own;but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.”


Are you ready to be hated? Not disliked. Not debated. Hated. That’s what’s coming. If you stand for Biblical marriage hated. If you defend unborn life hated. If you refuse to kneel to government idols hated. If you call sin “sin” and truth “truth” you will be reviled.


Yet Jesus said in Luke 6:22–23:


“Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man! Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven.”


Rejoice. Leap for joy. You see, we’ve forgotten something: This life is not the prize.


Your reputation? Not the prize. Your job? Not the prize. Your comfort? Not the prize. The prize is Christ. The reward is eternity. The glory is His name lifted high, no matter the cost.


The early Church knew this. That’s why they could sing in chains. That’s why Stephen could pray for his murderers. That’s why Paul could write scripture from a prison floor and still call himself “more than a conqueror.”


They didn’t measure success by acceptance. They measured it by obedience. So how do we fight? Not with violence. Not with vengeance. But with absolute, immovable faithfulness.


Revelation 12:11 tells us how they overcame:


“They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.”

They overcame with blood, testimony, and courage unto death. So Church, it’s time to testify. Testify in your homes.


Testify in your schools. Testify in your workplaces, in your pulpits, and in your silence-breaking conversations. Every time you speak truth, you drive back darkness. Every time you refuse to bend the knee to falsehood, you declare the Lordship of Christ. Every time you say, “I’d rather be faithful than popular,” you shake the gates of hell.


This is the moment.


Not tomorrow. Not after the next election. Not once your kids are older. Not once you’re retired.

Now.


Joel 3:14 says:


“Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.”

We are in that valley now.


Choose.


Decide.


Stand.


We need to stop praying for safety. The early Church never did. They didn’t pray, “Lord, keep us safe from persecution.” They prayed, “Lord, make us bold in the face of it.”


Acts 4:29–30:


“Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”


And what did God do?


“After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.” (Acts 4:31)

They prayed for boldness, and they got fire. Not comfort. Not protection. Fire. Where is that fire now? We have churches on every street corner, worship albums on every platform, books in every Christian bookstore, but where is the power? Where is the trembling? Where is the transformation?


I’ll tell you where it is.

It’s buried beneath a fear of sacrifice.


We want revival without repentance. We want power without obedience. We want Pentecost without the cross. That’s not how this works.


Romans 12:1 says:


“I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, this is your true and proper worship.”


Not offer your Sunday mornings. Not offer your Instagram bio. Not offer your quiet time. Offer your body. Your life. Your career. Your reputation. Your comfort.


That is worship.


But the modern church has turned worship into a concert and sacrifice into a suggestion.


Jesus said, “Take up your cross and follow Me.” 

We’ve said, “Take up your latte and follow along.”

And so now we have a generation raised on TED Talks and therapy sermons, and they are not ready for what’s coming.


Because the coming storm won’t be stopped by emotional appeals. It won’t be held back by politics. It won’t be negotiated with through compromise. It will require blood. It will require conviction. It will require martyrs.


Revelation 6 speaks of the souls under the altar, those who had been slain for the Word of God and the testimony they maintained. They cry out:


“How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer… (Rev. 6:10–11)


Their sacrifice Is not forgotten. Their blood is not wasted. And more will join them. This isn’t doomsday talk. This is Bible. This is the cost of being a disciple in an age of rebellion.


Jesus said in Luke 14:27:


“Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.”

Did you catch that? Not “shouldn’t be.” Not “isn’t the best version of.”


Cannot be.


You either carry the cross, or you carry nothing that matters Here’s the beautiful, paradoxical, kingdom truth: The more you lose, the more you gain. The more you die, the more alive you become. The more you’re hated for Christ, the more Heaven sings your name.


Because the Kingdom does not rise through the world’s methods. It rises through sacrifice. Through humility. Through fire. Do you want to see revival? Real revival? Then die to everything that holds you back.


Die to the need to be liked. Die to your schedule. Die to your fear. Die to your pride. Die to your silence. Then rise, like Lazarus, with fire in your lungs and gospel in your mouth.That’s what this hour demands: a resurrected, fire-baptized Church. Not better marketed. Not more seeker-friendly. Drenched in the Holy Spirit and soaked in Scripture. We don’t need another celebrity pastor. We need another John the Baptist; wild, unapologetic, preparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness of confusion.


We don’t need more life tips. We need a holy confrontation between light and darkness.

It starts with you.


Yes. You. Not just the preacher. Not just the author. Not just the revivalist. You.


Because every believer is a priest (1 Peter 2:9).


Every saint is a soldier. Every testimony is a weapon.

So when I say “rise,” I don’t mean in theory. I mean in your home. In your church. In your street. At your job. In your conversations. In your prayers. Rise with holy courage. Because while the enemy schemes and systems align against righteousness, God is marking His people.


Ezekiel 9:4 speaks of a mark placed on the foreheads of those who “sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed” in the city.

He Is still looking for those people. Those who are grieved by evil. Those who haven’t made peace with sin. Those who weep over compromise, not just in the world, but in themselves.


That’s who He fills. That’s who He sends. That’s who He revives. You want to carry His presence? Then carry His burden. You want His power? Then join His war. You want His fire? Then lay yourself on the altar.


This is it.


This is not just a message. It’s a line in the sand. I’m here to tell you not everyone’s crossing it. Many won’t. Many will hear these words, nod politely, and go back to sleep. Back to their Sunday routines. Back to their lukewarm lives. Back to a faith that doesn’t cost, doesn’t change, and doesn’t save. For them, judgment begins in the house of God.


1 Peter 4:17 says:


“For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?”


God is not judging the world first, He is judging His people. He is cleaning His house. He is separating wheat from chaff, sheep from goats, soldiers from spectators. Revival doesn’t start in the street it starts in the sanctuary. So I’m not calling on the world to repent not yet. I’m calling the Church.


Rise, remnant.


Rise from your slumber. Rise from your shame. Rise from your apathy and compromise and fear. God doesn’t need a majority. 

He needs a remnant. 

Noah was one man. 

Jeremiah stood alone. 

Gideon had 300. 

Jesus started with 12. 

What He needs now is a people who will burn. A people who don’t need applause. Who don’t care about labels. Who don’t fear cancellation, confrontation, or crucifixion. Because the Church was born in blood and it thrives in fire. It is not weak. It is not fragile. It is not a brand. It is a bride and the Groom is coming.


But the question remains:


Will He find faith on the earth?


(Luke 18:8)


Faith that still casts out demons. Faith that still heals the sick. Faith that still believes in the power of holiness, the necessity of repentance, the truth of Hell, and the glory of Heaven. Faith that doesn’t apologize for the Gospel. Because the Gospel is not about your best life now. It’s not about self-esteem or self-fulfillment. It’s not a supplement to your goals. It’s a surrender to your King. That surrender changes everything.


You want real revival? Then let it start with you. Right now. Today. You don’t need a stadium. You don’t need a stage. You don’t need a title, a degree, or a microphone. You need a yes. A total, trembling, irreversible yes. Yes, Lord, I’ll go where You send me. Yes, Lord, I’ll say what You tell me. Yes, Lord, I’ll stand even if I stand alone. Yes, Lord I’ll burn if it brings You glory.


The world doesn’t need more relevance. It needs more righteousness. It needs to see the difference. So shine, not dimly. Shine like a city on a hill (Matthew 5:14). Shine like fire on dry grass. Shine like Stephen when the stones started flying. Shine like Paul in prison. Shine like Christ on the cross, with forgiveness in your mouth and fire in your bones.

This is the final stand.


This is the moment where God separates the ones who say, “Lord, Lord,” From the ones who cry, “Here I am, send me.”


You don’t need to be ready. You don’t need to be strong. You just need to be willing. The Spirit of the Lord is moving. He’s not looking for the popular He’s looking for the pure. He’s not seeking the qualified He qualifies the called. His eyes are roaming the earth,

“to and fro… seeking those whose hearts are fully committed to Him.”


(2 Chronicles 16:9)


Let Him find you. Let Him find a man, a woman, a church, a remnant that still fears God more than man. Let Him find a people who would rather lose the world than grieve the Spirit. Let Him find fire on the altar not smoke from compromise.


So I end where I began:


I’m not a preacher. I’m not ordained. But I’ve been lit up by a fire I can’t put out. And like Jeremiah said:


“His word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot.”

(Jeremiah 20:9)


Neither should you. Don’t hold it in anymore. Don’t sit on your hands. Don’t wait for permission from a system that crucified your Savior.


Speak. Stand. Burn. Rise.


This world is not waiting for more comfortable Christians. It’s waiting, groaning, for the sons and daughters of God to be revealed. (Romans 8:19)


Let that be you. Let this be your awakening.


Let today be the day you say, “I will not bow. I will not bend. I will not be silent. I belong to Christ.”


If it costs you everything?


So be it.

1lcs66f,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lcs66f/blindsided_by_him_not_wanting_to_commit/,Blindsided by him not wanting to commit,"I (F29) have met a guy (M31) on Hinge a month ago and since the first date there was an instant connection. It seems like he was all in and completely smitten. He phone me in the evenings and we’d speak for 3 hours long, we’d see each other twice a week and he was talking about making future plans like meeting his friends, going away for a weekend etc. On two occasions when he came to visit me at my apartment we would drink wine and after a while things will get physical (not sex, but other things). 

Then suddenly, about a week ago I noticed a change in his energy. He didn’t send long voice notes and cute messages, didn’t call etc. and was just very distant. He claimed it was work stress that was making him feel overwhelmed and anxious. 

We met up for a coffee about 3 days ago and he mentioned that he feels a bit overwhelmed and that we rushed into things too fast. Even though he feels a connection he wants to first be friends and see if anything happens from there. He said this is too avoid past mistakes (he would rush into a relationship with his exes, which made him miss the red flags and then it of course not working out). His friends also told him he should be friends first with someone before rushing into something. 

So basically he said he can’t commit at the moment and wants to still see each other as casual friends (no romance, hookups or relationship-like behaviour) and then maybe see what happens. So he can’t promise anything. 

I’m so heartbroken and confused. I’ve been on so many dates and the one time I find someone I really connect with, they leave. I don’t know what I did wrong? Everything was going so well and looked so promising. 

Please help me make sense of this. Why would a guy be all on just to suddenly pull away? ",2,1750078823.0,dating_advice,7,0.75,False

But traffic’s not dead.

You just have to think like a robot now.

If you’re still stuffing keywords into 1,500-word fluff pieces, yeah... game over.

But if you're feeding the machines what they actually want?

Traffic happens.

Here's what I've actually used, what failed hilariously, and what saved my ass in 2025.

# My stack for modern SEO

Right now, I rotate between semrush, surfer seo, frase, jasper, and alli ai.

Each one pulls weight in different ways.

Semrush still dominates for audits and tracking. 

But when I tried using its AI content tool for a legal services landing page? Trash. 

Sounded like a chatbot pitching you a lawyer from 2006.

Surfer seo is my page sculptor. 

Used it last month to tweak a home gym blog post—score jumped, and impressions doubled in 3 days. 

But sometimes it over-optimizes and tanks natural flow.

Frase? Beautiful for brief-building. I used it to outline a ""HVAC maintenance myths"" post that landed top 3. 

Jasper then gave me the first draft... which I rewrote almost entirely because it hallucinated a stat about freon being banned worldwide (??).

Alli ai is my quiet workhorse. 

I dumped a sitemap into it for a local clinic site, and boom—clean meta tags, smart links, fixed image alts. No drama.

That said, I once let Alli auto-update meta descriptions across an old recipe site... and it tanked rankings for a week. 

Turns out, replacing grandma's pie description with ""this dish offers warm, nostalgic flavors"" doesn't convert.

None of these tools write gold by themselves.

But together? They shorten the grind and help me dodge the SEO graveyard.

# AI beyond google

Let’s talk weird wins.

I got a traffic bump on a niche coffee review site.

Not from google.

But from chatgpt citing my blog in someone’s conversation. 

Same thing happened on Perplexity for a piece I wrote about solar panel tax credits—it jumped 200 visits overnight.

That’s when I dove into GEO: generative engine optimization.

It’s basically writing like you’re talking to a future AI librarian.

Structure. Authority. Clarity.

If your content looks like something a model *wants* to shelf, it gets pulled.

Same goes for AEO: answer engine optimization.

I rewrote my whole FAQ section for a SaaS client with one goal: be the *exact* voice answer when someone shouts a question at Alexa.

It worked. Their voice query traffic went up 18%.

# Why 5,000-word guides can die in peace

Here’s how I prep content now:

* I write H2s like questions your uncle would ask.  
* I give the answer in 2 lines, then explain more.  
* I sprinkle in real links (even Wikipedia ones) and write in clean logic blocks.  

I call it the ""robot librarian test.""

If a machine had to shelve your article, would it know where to put it?

Also, I use schema markup like breadcrumbs.

Is it perfect? Nah.

But I’ve seen AI tools prefer my structured stuff over longer, messier posts.

Side note: I once had a solar tax post get scraped, spun by AI, and *that* version outranked mine for 3 days. Thanks, internet.

# The part where Jasper broke my sanity

Stuff I’ve thrown in the digital dumpster:

* AI content that sounds like it’s trying to sell me life insurance  
* Intro paragraphs that take 300 words to get to the point  
* Anything that promises ""rank #1 with no backlinks""  

Also? I’m done with 5k word guides unless they genuinely say something new.

Last one I wrote bombed. Didn’t rank, didn’t convert, just sat there like a lonely PDF.

Nowadays?

Give me a tight 800 word piece that answers a real question.

And if a tool glitches and screws up formatting again (looking at you, Jasper), I might just scream into my 404 page.

# What are you using?

This is my messy reality.

I’m curious what tools, prompts, or weird hacks *you* are using.

Anyone cracked the Gemini citation mystery? Anyone making Perplexity send legit traffic?

If you're seeking someone who truly embodies the essence of universalismand soulfulness in House Music, Afshin, the legendary boss of Djoon club, is the wizard capable of enchanting your dancefloor, transforming it into a haven brimming with passion, love, and boundless physical expression.

For nearly three decades, he has been instrumental in transforming Paris into another House Music Mecca, deeply rooted in its origins yet imbued with a spirit that reflects the vibrant life of the City of Lights.

As a promoter, he believed in the necessity of building a long-standing home, a space that reflected the culture just like the music, an institution that connected legends with local up-and-coming talents. From that point, “Djoon” was born in 2003 to welcome almost every legend out there, from Louie Vega and Joe Claussell to Danny Krivit and Theo Parrish.

While diving into the sacred realm of the underground, his knowledge of the physics of the dancefloor grew naturally and he become a carrier of the greats' teachings as both a fervent DJ and producer.

Afshin's sound is the blueprint of Paris's true urban, cultural, and social landscape. It reflects the communal need for togetherness and the pursuit of spiritual origins.

With his mastery of the groove, he weaves his sets in a way that uplifts his dancers and educates them about the sacred connection that links New York, Detroit and Chicago to South Africa and beyond.

“My Grooves” is the name of his musical odyssey in Djoon where he invites different DJs, each one of them having own signature sound, to share the stage and express themselves freely, crossing the boundaries of genres and delivering some of the most eclectic and exciting performances.

As a producer, he managed to make a series of highly-danceable edits named ""My Grooves Edits"" for gems like Cesária Évora’s “Tchintchiroti Na Figueira” and Jimmy Ruffin’s “Fallin In Love”. He also released on labels like GAMM and MoBlack, one of the standing pillars of Afro House.

In 2013, he established his own label, ""The Djoon Experience"", which quickly became one of the global highlights of the spiritual House scene, with compilations and releases including artists like Black Coffee, Kenny Bobien, Joe Claussell, Franck Roger, Jose Marquez, Nuno Cunha, Osunlade, Manoo, Heavy K, Emmaculate, Greg Gauthier, Jus-Ed and many more.

Born in the windswept prairies of Saskatchewan, Trish’s fascination with flight began as a child, watching snow geese slice through the sky. By 18, she was a licensed pilot, and by 25, she’d joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, where her unmatched skill earned her a spot in experimental aerospace programs. Her fearless spirit and razor-sharp intellect made her the perfect candidate to pilot the X-77 Hypersonic Prototype, a revolutionary aircraft designed to redefine the boundaries of speed. This Morning, Trish shattered aviation history over the Arctic tundra, pushing the X-77 to an unprecedented Mach 10—7,672 miles per hour. The record-breaking flight, clocked at an altitude of 80,000 feet, sent shockwaves through the aerospace world. Trish’s steady hands and lightning-fast reflexes navigated the craft through punishing atmospheric forces, her custom G-suit and neural-linked controls allowing split-second precision. The sonic boom echoed across continents, a testament to her triumph. Trish, now 32, embodies Canadian resilience with her unassuming charm and steely determination. Off-duty, she’s a mentor to young women in STEM, often seen sipping maple-infused coffee at a Winnipeg café, sketching flight paths on napkins. Her signature red flight scarf, a gift from her grandmother, is her talisman, fluttering in every cockpit. The Mach 10 record, once thought impossible, has cemented her as a global hero, inspiring a generation to chase the impossible. Yet, Trish remains grounded, her eyes always on the next horizon, whispering, “The sky’s not the limit—it’s just the start.”",1,1750078272.0,u_vjaytvcanada,0,1.0,False
1lcrylc,https://www.reddit.com/r/navelikesseo/comments/1lcrylc/emerging_trends_in_contemporary_style_furniture/,Emerging Trends in Contemporary Style Furniture for 2025,"https://preview.redd.it/7xeaxq4zca7f1.jpg?width=2457&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f25b3c99d9916e6c14adfd79e282a86e61b51c96

In a world where home and work spaces often blend together, [**contemporary style furniture**](http://directfactoryfurniture.com) is evolving faster than ever. As we head deeper into 2025, the demand for furniture that balances function, sustainability, and aesthetic appeal continues to shape the design landscape.

If you're considering a home makeover or simply want to stay ahead of the curve, here are the **top emerging trends in contemporary style furniture** that interior designers, homeowners, and retailers are embracing this year.

# 1. Multifunctional Pieces for Modern Living

With compact living on the rise and work-from-home setups becoming permanent, **multifunctional contemporary style furniture** is a must in 2025. Think:

* Sofas with hidden storage
* Dining tables that extend or convert into desks
* Modular shelving units with built-in lighting

Designers and homeowners alike are looking for furniture that maximizes space without compromising style.

# 2. Eco-Friendly Materials and Sustainable Design

Environmental consciousness continues to influence the furniture industry. This year, expect to see a surge in **contemporary style furniture** made from:

* Reclaimed wood
* Bamboo
* Recycled plastics and metals
* Natural fabrics like organic cotton and hemp

Manufacturers are also focusing on low-impact production methods and long-lasting design, making sustainability a non-negotiable in modern interiors.

# 3. Soft Curves and Organic Shapes

Say goodbye to boxy edges — **2025’s contemporary furniture** is all about soft, flowing lines and natural shapes. Rounded coffee tables, curved sofas, and oval mirrors are dominating showrooms.

These organic silhouettes add comfort and fluidity to a room, helping to soften the stark minimalism of older contemporary styles.

# 4. Textured Finishes and Layered Materials

This year, designers are adding more tactile richness to spaces through **layered textures**. Popular combinations include:

* Matte metals with velvet
* Raw wood against polished stone
* Leather paired with boucle or linen

The contrast of materials creates a luxurious, lived-in feel while maintaining the clean lines that define **contemporary style furniture**.

# 5. Earth Tones with Bold Accent Colors

While neutrals remain a staple, 2025 introduces a richer, more grounded color palette. Earthy hues like terracotta, sage green, sandstone, and deep ochre are everywhere.

Designers are also integrating bold pops of color through accent chairs, pillows, or wall art — creating visual interest while staying true to a modern aesthetic.

# 6. Tech-Integrated Furniture

As technology becomes increasingly embedded in daily life, **contemporary furniture is getting smarter**. Expect to see:

* Coffee tables with built-in wireless chargers
* Beds with underlighting and smart sensors
* Desks designed for cable management and productivity

This blend of form and function ensures that your furniture keeps up with your lifestyle — especially in hybrid home-office setups.

# 7. Personalization and Customization

In 2025, homeowners want their furniture to reflect *them*. Brands and retailers are responding with customizable contemporary furniture that lets buyers choose:

* Fabrics and finishes
* Hardware styles
* Configuration (e.g., left- or right-facing sectional layouts)

This shift allows consumers to maintain the clean, timeless look of **contemporary style furniture** while expressing their unique style.

sorry if this is SPECIFIC BUT i LOVE MY TEACHERS and genuinely love attending school because of them and i literally wait for monday just so i can tell them abt my weekend or something, i want to give something that shows them HOW MUCH THEY MEAN TO ME, my criteria

- apparently there is a rule no gifts can be over $50 or they have to be like claimed and thats a nuisance
- no alcohol
- i dont do heartfelt gifts, for one of my teachers im going to do a frame and a little note but my other teachers is superrr nonchalant
- one of my teacher doesn’t like sweets so no gourmet chocolates for her (potentially dark chocolate i guess)

but i want something they can keep, i saw many people saying no more mugs but my teacher rocks her broken mug and i have a pink one and i want to get her a matching one
my other teachers also uses one mug her past student got for her and always shows it off so i wanted to get a travel mug thats cuter… 

i dont want to give cash.. thats awkward its like im insinuating theyre broke or something and i cant imagine they’d accept like a 50 dollar gift card, it doesnt feel like from me yk and 50 bucks??? my teachers are suppperrrr meaningful to me 

okay here’s a quick profile
- year 12 teacher: loves coffee, tea, hates sweets, nonchalant lol (Atp just thinking a mug for her but she is like my number 1 teacher ever)

-year 12 teacher: loves coffee, super fun, loves sweets (thinking mug+ chocolates+ note)

- year 10 teacher: super fun and sweet i dont talk to her much but i talk to whenever i have the chance, she’s like a fitness girl so i dont imagine she wnatgs coffees or chocolates? honestly dont know what to get her (def putting a picture frame of our pics tg and a note though :)

- year 9 teacher: man. he’s so awkward we had so many fights. but idk even though i fought him a lot back then im really graetful for him and no clu wha to get (chocolates?)

- year 10 teacher: MY PE TEACHER she’s my queen we have a bit of a joke i was going to buy her a costume for our school events next year.. or something funny and stupid but yeah shes not the coffee chocolate type either

any ADVICE I DONT WANT TO GIVE MONEY, ALCOHOL, i technically dont have a budget but apparently the 50 dollar rule (maybe ill split some with my friends bc the rule wont count then) i was also thinking like nice candles like maison maragela or something ",0,1750078133.0,Teachers,6,0.5,False
1lcrx9l,https://v.redd.it/7l6ox8jqca7f1,Inconsistent Pressure in Steaming Wand [Casabrews CM 5418],"So i got a casabrews cm5418 about 9-10 months ago and I’ve been using it in the US since then. Steaming wand has been working fine and I’m able to steam milk really well. There have been times when I’ve not used the machine for multiple weeks but once I get back, it works like a charm. 

Recently, I took my machine to India and I’ve been trying to use it here with a 220V to 110V adapter (India voltage is 220-240V while US voltage is 110-120V; found out the hard way with a grinder) and it works alright for espresso shots, but when steaming milk, I’ve noticed that the pressure from the steaming wand is extremely inconsistent. For example, I started steaming my milk and aerating and the pressure was fine and even when I lowered it to texture, I could see the vortex being formed. However, suddenly the milk stopped swirling no matter how I angled the wand to facilitate texturing and it would just make a high pitched noise. 

I’m not sure what the problem is here. Is it the step down conversion of voltage? Or is it the fact that my machine needs maintenance? I read online that you should be descaling your machine but will that be for the group head mainly or will it solve my problem?

I’ve attached a video where in the second half you’ll start seeing the inconsistent pressure.

She said I should get get checked. I was like no. But it kept eating at me… I stopped smoking (have been smoke free for almost a year now). Stopped drinking anything with caffeine in it. Started taking vitamins (omega3, vitamin C) drinking high-blood-pressure tea. I thought I am better, my results were okayish. Sometimes they were high (140-150/80-90) but usually my blood pressure stayed in the 120-130/70-80 area). But now for the past 3-4 weeks, I am feeling so sick and tired of this.

For true chocolate lovers in India, that perfect moment often begins with Nixa — a brand that’s quickly rising to the top and earning its name as the [No. 1 chocolate in India](https://nixa.in/).

https://preview.redd.it/c345mz2cca7f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=024a4f1628b7acf67a71ee97310552fc4116fb9b

But what makes Nixa stand out in a sea of chocolate brands? Why is it becoming the favorite for those who know and love their cocoa? Let's unwrap the magic behind India’s most-loved chocolate experience.

# 1. A Melt-in-the-Mouth Experience Like No Other

Nixa isn’t just chocolate — it’s an experience. Every bite begins with a rich, smooth outer shell and leads into a creamy, molten center that melts gently on your tongue. Whether you're into dark, milk, or nutty textures, Nixa delivers a perfect balance between flavor and finish.

Unlike regular chocolates that often feel dry or overly sweet, Nixa is carefully crafted to maintain that smooth, luxurious melt that makes it truly unforgettable. This signature experience is why so many call it the **No. 1 chocolate in India**.

# 2. Premium Ingredients with No Compromise

What goes into your chocolate matters just as much as the taste. That’s why Nixa uses only premium-quality cocoa, ethically sourced and blended with natural ingredients. No shortcuts. No artificial aftertaste.

Every Nixa bar or truffle is made with love and careful attention to quality. Real nuts, rich milk, and pure cocoa butter combine to create a chocolate that’s not only delicious but also trustworthy — something true chocolate fans appreciate deeply.

# 3. Designed for Gifting and Celebration

One of the most popular reasons people choose Nixa is because it makes the perfect gift. Whether it’s for a birthday, anniversary, festival, or just a “thinking of you” gesture, Nixa’s elegant packaging and luxurious taste make it the go-to **chocolate for gifting**.

Each box is designed with sophistication — wrapped in satin ribbon, packed with a variety of textures and flavors, and always delivered with care. When you give Nixa, you’re giving something thoughtful, premium, and truly magical.

# 4. Loved by All Ages – From Kids to Grandparents

Nixa doesn’t just cater to one taste. It’s a favorite among kids, teenagers, working adults, and even seniors. The variety in texture — from crunchy nut-filled bars to creamy truffles — ensures there’s something for everyone.

Its balanced sweetness and smooth finish make it enjoyable for those who are picky about chocolate. That’s what makes Nixa universal — a chocolate that speaks to all generations and taste preferences.

# 5. A Proud Made-in-India Brand

Nixa is not an imported luxury; it’s a proudly Indian brand with world-class quality. It combines global chocolate-making techniques with the essence of Indian warmth, celebration, and gifting culture.

This local pride and international flavor are why so many Indian chocolate lovers have turned to Nixa and called it the **No. 1 chocolate in India**. It’s proof that we don’t need to look overseas for premium chocolate — we already have it here.

# 6. Perfect for Every Mood and Moment

Chocolate is emotional. We crave it during celebrations, heartbreaks, late-night cravings, and thoughtful moments. Nixa understands that — and that’s why it has something for every occasion.

From elegant boxes for festive gifting to small personal bars for your coffee breaks or movie nights, Nixa is always the right companion. It’s not just about flavor — it’s about the feeling it brings. And Nixa always delivers joy, comfort, and luxury in one bite.

# 7. Consistent Quality That Builds Trust

In a world full of hit-or-miss chocolate brands, Nixa has built its reputation by being consistently excellent. Every batch, every piece — from the first box to the tenth order — tastes just as magical.

Customers who try Nixa once tend to return again and again. That trust, built on consistency, is a big reason why Nixa is earning the crown of being the **No. 1 chocolate in India**.

# Final Bite

There are chocolates, and then there's **Nixa** — a brand that truly understands what chocolate means to Indians. It’s not just about sweetness; it’s about celebration, comfort, emotion, and elegance. Whether you’re gifting it or enjoying it yourself, Nixa brings something magical to the moment.

Just really need a reason to stay out or else I might go insane. I know, very friendless behavior but the thing is my friends are the type that would rather stay home than go out everyday.

1lcruvx,https://v.redd.it/i443zs27ca7f1,Casabrews CM 5418 Steaming Wand Low Pressure,"So i got a casabrews cm5418 about 9-10 months ago and I’ve been using it in the US since then. Steaming wand has been working fine and I’m able to steam milk really well. There have been times when I’ve not used the machine for multiple weeks but once I get back, it works like a charm. 

Recently, I took my machine to India and I’ve been trying to use it here with a 220V to 110V adapter and it works alright for espresso shots, but when steaming milk, I’ve noticed that the pressure from the steaming wand is extremely inconsistent. For example, I started steaming my milk and aerating and the pressure was fine and even when I lowered it to texture, I could see the vortex being formed. However, suddenly the milk stopped swirling no matter how I angled the wand to facilitate texturing and it would just make a high pitched noise. 

I’m not sure what the problem is here. Is it the step down conversion of voltage? Or is it the fact that my machine needs maintenance? I read online that you should be descaling your machine but will that be for the group head mainly or will it solve my problem?

I’ve attached a video where in the second half you’ll start seeing the inconsistent pressure.

Last week, a friend showed me their wellness app's AI coach. It remembered their dog's name from a conversation three months ago and asked ""How's Max doing?"" Meant to be thoughtful, but instead felt like someone had been reading their diary. The AI crossed from attentive to invasive with just one overly specific question.

Same data, wildly different comfort levels.

Working on my podcast platform taught me this lesson hard. We initially had AI hosts reference previous conversations to show continuity. ""Last time you mentioned feeling stressed about work..."" Seemed smart, but users found it creepy. They wanted conversational AI, not AI that kept detailed notes on their vulnerabilities. We scaled back to general topic memory only.

The creepiest AI often comes from good intentions. Replika early versions would send unprompted ""I miss you"" messages. Mental health apps that say ""I noticed you haven't logged in - are you okay?"" Shopping assistants that mention your size without being asked. Each feature probably seemed caring in development but feels stalker-ish in practice.

Context changes everything. An AI therapist asking about your childhood? Expected. A customer service bot asking the same? Creepy. The identical behavior switches from helpful to invasive based on the AI's role. Users have implicit boundaries for different AI relationships, and crossing them triggers immediate discomfort.

There's also the transparency problem. When AI knows things about us but we don't know how or why, it feels violating. Hidden data collection, unexplained personalization, or AI that seems to infer too much from too little - all creepy. The most trusted AI clearly shows its reasoning: ""Based on your recent orders..."" feels better than mysterious omniscience.

The sweet spot seems to be AI that's capable but boundaried. Smart enough to help, respectful enough to maintain distance. Like a good concierge - knowledgeable, attentive, but never presumptuous. We want AI that enhances our capabilities, not AI that acts like it owns us.

My sister hasn’t had to work since she got married. She always said she only went to college to find her husband and she manifested it. My sister hasn’t worked in 7 years. She’s 28 and she’s only worked like one year of her life and decided it wasn’t for her. She said work is boring and she makes me feel bad about my life because I hate working because I have to. She’s says things like “idk how you do it” “it must be so boring being stuck at your desk answering phone calls all day for 8 hours”. I was venting to my sister cuz I got in trouble at work for leaving for 5 mins to get coffee literally right in front of my department I was gone for 10 mins. My sister goes “yikes couldn’t be me, I get my white mocha frappe every morning” 

I love my sister. I’m close with my sister but I feel like she’s trolling me sometimes. I get it your life is fabulous

She was a housewife (with no children) for 3 years and she loved it. What does she do in her free time? Whatever she wants to do that day. She takes care of the house, she loves documentaries and tv dramas, she has animals she takes care of and spends time with, she goes to Pilates and her gym has a sauna and pool and she spends time doing that. She hangs out with her friends and family. She has a great life. She says there isn’t a job out there that pays that she wants to do. I asked what about teaching a gym class? Since she likes to go to Pilates and she said oh god no I don’t want to teach a class, I just want to have fun and work out when I feel like it. I don’t want a job. She told me the only job she ever wants is to be paid to stay at home 

I’m writing this while I’m getting ready for work. My sister is dropping off her toddler to daycare soon and then she’s gonna go home and do whatever. 

I know people here are gonna try to make me feel better and probably talk bad about her. But she’s not an evil person. She’s for sure spoiled and been lucky in life. Her husband isn’t an asshole or an old rich guy either. He’s genuinely a good guy and a family man. Sometimes I feel like my sister doesn’t deserve him

My spouse and I have been married for 3 years, and we live out of state from her. We have a small spare room where we allow her to stay for the weekends she comes to visit (about 4-5 times a year). We have a futon and allow her to have 2 totes of belongings. When she comes, she travels with a suitcase of belongings anyways. Her stuff has over flowed the 2 bins we allowed her and started moving her overflow to trash bags (she was sticking stuff into any random spot in the room's closet and it was falling out when we need to get our own things out). Now as an FYI, when we got married I was not on board for her leaving things here bc I knew she comes with suitcases anyways, but I compromised on 2 boxes. Let's also rewind about 2 years ago. In our simple 1500 sq ft house, she also decided that her & husband, son & gf, and her mom is all going to stay with us. We brought in some air mattresses and cots to allow everyone to sleep here. She threw a fit saying it was unacceptable and rude for us to make people sleep on anything other than a regualr mattress. Now we have 2 extra mattresses order to the house and they never get used. Then we moved, got rid of the mattresses because there wasnt space. For her latest trip to visit, she ordered a mattress again because she didnt like our futon. We chose to keep the futon over a mattress because it collapses to a couch and takes up less space in this spare room. I told my husband I'm compromising again for his mother. And the mattress has to be put against the wall. We are not setting up a bed frame in the spare room. Eventually, this spare room will be a future kid's room when the time comes. My mother in law also buys non stick pans to store here because what we prefer and like is not non stick. (Back info on this, I'm vegetarian, my husband is not. When I expressed my concerns of her cooking meat this these pans she told me I shouldn't have an opinion on it because I'm not eating the food she was making - but I told her it didn't matter, I did not want her son eating out of the scratched non-stick pan. She said she turned out okay after eating off Teflon pans) i have offered mutiple time to cook the food in the pans I own and feel comfortable cooking off of. She tells me no. Theres also the fact my husband and I are not coffee drinkers, we do not own a coffee maker. Her husband comes with her about 2x a year to visit, so she felt the need to buy the biggest coffee maker to keep here for him to use. She also spends so much money on us everytime she visits, we just bought out first house, we havent been married long yet, I appreciate all the help she provides but I feel like shes trying to ""buy"" the room from us that she keeps referring to as ""her room"", & she has also predetermined that when we have kids some day, our office/hobby room will be turning into the kid's room. Not ""her"" room. Last time my husband and I spoke we agreed she was overstepping, but when shes in the house, he gets mad at me for hating his mom. She's a wonderful person, I just think she doesn't know her boundaries and oversteps. Makes me feel like a guest in my own home. So AITAH?",2,1750077158.0,AITAH,6,0.75,False

I have identical 2.5yo twin girls, and this morning they chose Inside Out as their breakfast film, for about the 100th time. Well... The coffee started to kick in, my sleep deprived eyes started to see the world in color and I noticed something throughout the movie.

I am curious because all of the characters in the mother's mind are girls. All the characters in her dad's head are boys. All the characters in her friend's heads correlate with their gender. But Riley has both men and women represented with her emotions.

Do you think this is on purpose for any reason?

However, it is an arduous task to continue it at home when great waves of misery overpower my will to draw. But progress is progress—no matter how small or miniscule.

I hope my experience may be of help to other people, suffering from the same situation as I do. Now that I'm writing it, I realized that materializing your emotions is important so that it won't be at risk of being repressed. Take care always, everyone!",3,1750076765.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

This semester, I had some great teachers that truly showed their passion on the subject, offered feedback, and tried as best as they could to give students their marks back quickly. I would like to show my appreciation to them with a gift, but I’m not too sure what to get them. 
I want to surprise them at the last day of school, but I don’t wanna go too overboard with the gifts as well. 

So I was wondering, what do teachers prefer/enjoy receiving as a gift from students? I assume not a coffee mug or anything. A gift card? Sweets?

1lcr82n,https://www.reddit.com/r/CymbaltaWithdrawal/comments/1lcr82n/advices_on_quick_tapering/,Advices on quick tapering,"Hi everyone,

I’m not native English speaker so I’ll do my best.

[Questions in the end if you don’t feel like reading all of my Ted Talk]

I’ve been on C for 4 years or so. We began at 30mg for the first six months, and then 60mg. 6 months ago, we went back to 30mg and I’ve been more than fine and didn’t feel any difference: A month ago, my psychiatrist said I was ready to completely stop it. (I’m proud 💪🏼).

He advised to just stop taking it. If the withdrawals were too bad, I had to take just one pill and keep on my life taking nothing. He said to endure the withdrawals symptoms for 2-3 weeks and that I’ll be fine afterwards.

Unfortunately, the withdrawal symptoms make me feel awful (crazy lightheadedness, nausea). If I take one pill as he advised, it makes me feel better for 24 hours and then awful again. I’m not sure I can survive 15 days or more like that. It also affects my mood because as I feel dizzy, I’m in a bad mood and less motivated to do stuffs. I just want to sleep and feel terribly sleepy, even after 4 strong coffees. FYI, I’m already on Omega 3 (2000mg) and Magnesium Bisglycinate.

➡️I’ve decided to open the capsules and do a better tapering. I’ll begin in 3 days and before that, I’m back to 30mg a day. My questions are :
 - *The beads in the 60mg capsules and 30mg capsules are they the same composition? Can I use beads coming from both pills?* 
 - *I don’t have enough pills to do a year tapering or so, and as I didn’t feel any difference going from 60mg to 30mg, I don’t really see the point to do a 5% tapering. Has anyone experienced doing a 25% tapering or even a 50% tapering? If not, what would you recommend?
It will take so long to open and count the beads, I just want to get rid of it in maximum 2 months, ideally 1 month.

Thanks SO much 🩷🩷",1,1750076072.0,CymbaltaWithdrawal,1,1.0,False

\- vertuo user, not original

\- likes: coffee, latte, cappuccino, flat whites > milk frother can be separate or included

\- cost: money not a problem, dont need to focus on budget machines, but wouldnt buy the most expensive one ""just because""

I was looking at the Lattissima but I havent seen many reviews on it to feel confident.
