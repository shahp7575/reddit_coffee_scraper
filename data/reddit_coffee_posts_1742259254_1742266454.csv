I've been on this Java Burn ride for a while now, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my morning routine. Here's my take on it with all the deets you need.

**Java Burn Reviews: Real Talk Time** Alright, so I was skeptical at first, as we all are with these things, right? But after diving into Java Burn reviews, especially on consumer reports, I thought, Why not give it a shot?

**Java Burn Coffee: Elevating My Cup of Joe** So, what's the deal with Java Burn coffee? It's this dissolvable, tasteless packet you throw into your coffee, and bam, you've got this upgraded brew that's supposed to boost metabolism and energy. Intriguing, right?

**Java Burn Ingredients: Nature's Squad Goals** I did my homework on the ingredients – all-natural, vegetarian, gluten-free, and non-GMO. It's got this powerhouse combo that's supposed to set your metabolism on fire. Sounds like my kind of science!

**What is Java Burn? Unveiling the Magic** Java Burn is essentially this mix designed to amp up your metabolism when combined with coffee. It claims to torch fat, reduce hunger, and improve overall health. Bold promises, I know.

**Does Java Burn Work? My Experience** Okay, the million-dollar question. Does Java Burn actually work? For me, I'd say yes. I've been feeling more energized, noticed a bit of a reduction in those mid-morning cravings, and I swear my metabolism's doing a happy dance.

**Java Burn Complaints: Separating Fact from Fiction** Let's address the elephant in the room – complaints. I've seen some gripes, but honestly, most seem like folks not giving it enough time. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a supercharged metabolism.

**Java Burn Customer Reviews: Our Own Coffee Club** Being part of the Java Burn customer community is a trip. Shared my stash with friends, and now they're hooked too. It's like our little secret coffee club, and we're all in on the Java Burn magic.

**What Is in Java Burn? Breaking Down the Wizardry** I won't geek out too much, but the ingredients read like a who's who of metabolism support. If you're into the nitty-gritty, check it out – it's legit.

**Java Burn Scam: Let's Bust Some Myths** Scam or not? I did my digging, and I'm leaning towards not. I mean, I got what I paid for, and my coffee's never been this exciting.

**Reviews on Java Burn: Diverse Perspectives** I don't want you to just take my word for it. Dive into other Java Burn reviews for a broader picture. People's experiences vary, and it's good to get different perspectives.

**Is Java Burn a Scam? Spoiler Alert: Nah** With all the noise about scams, I get the hesitation. But from where I'm standing, Java Burn's delivering the goods without any shadiness.

**Java Burn Coffee Buy Online: My Go-To Move** Ordered mine online – smooth process. Amazon's got it, and it's a convenient way to get your hands on Java Burn without much fuss.

**Java Burns: More Than a Metaphor** Java Burn isn't just about metaphorical fires; it's about igniting that fire within, and for me, it's been a welcomed blaze.

**Is Java Burn Legit? No Smoke and Mirrors** Legitimacy matters, right? Java Burn checks the boxes for me – no weird stuff, quality ingredients, and it's doing what it promised.

**Ingredients in Java Burn: Nature's Toolbox Unveiled** If you're curious about the ingredients, and you should be, check out the Java Burn recipe. It's like nature's toolbox for a kick-ass metabolism.

**Java Burn Price: Paying for Transformation** Budget-wise, it's a bit of an investment, but for me, the transformation in how I feel has been worth every penny.

**Where to Buy Java Burn: The Authentic Source** Important PSA: Go for the official website or trusted sellers. Don't want any impostors messing with my Java Burn mojo.

1jdv4g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sparkdriver/comments/1jdv4g5/psa_walmart/,PSA: Walmart+,"PSA: Walmart+ Doesn’t Cover Your Driver’s Gas, Time, or Bills—Tip Your Delivery People!

Look, I get it. You paid $99 (or $50 when they have 50%off) for Walmart+ and think that means “free grocery delivery all year.” But let’s break this down real quick.

	•	$99 a year / 52 weeks = about $1.90 per week
	•	Even if you order once a week, that’s less than the price of a gas station coffee
	•	Meanwhile, the driver who got out of bed, got dressed, rushed to Walmart, hand-picked your groceries, packed them in their car, and drove them to you? They get nothing unless you tip.

You know what $99 doesn’t cover?
	•	Gas (which isn’t free)
	•	Car maintenance (also not free)
	•	Time spent picking your groceries like you’re our own grandma (seriously, we put in effort)
	•	The fact that we could be doing something else but instead are running all over town to bring you food

Walmart+ is a convenience fee to Walmart—it’s not a wage for drivers. Drivers rely on tips to make this worth the time and expense.

If you can afford to have someone shop, bag, load, and deliver your groceries, you can afford to tip at least a few bucks. If you truly can’t? At least acknowledge the effort. A “thank you” goes a long way.

And before anyone says, “Well, I don’t tip because [insert excuse]”—I give a free pass to seniors, disabled folks, and anyone genuinely struggling. But if you’re placing multiple orders a week and flexing a stocked fridge while stiffing your driver? Yeah, we notice.

Tipping isn’t mandatory, but neither is treating your driver like a personal servant. Be decent,kind and understanding…

1jdv053,https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyTab/comments/1jdv053/s6_lite_pixelated_screen_after_ad_crashed_game/,S6 Lite Pixelated Screen after ad crashed game,"My friend doesn’t have this so I’m posting on her behalf so bear with me. Tonight she was playing a game, Good Coffee Great Coffee, and after watching an ad for some color match game, her tablet lost its mind. Half-way through the ad when it switched to the “try out” screen and she clicked on it, the app store quick download screen popped up, it crashed the entire game and went back to the home screen. 

The issue is, there was a faint outline for the ad and app store pop up. She tried the usual troubleshooting before deciding to power it off and restart the entire tablet. Now, while powering back on, there are red streaks across the entire tablet on the loading screen and then when it powers completely back on, the screen is super pixelated and unreadable. It also has red lines randomly pop up across the bottom of the screen every couple of minutes before disappearing again. She scanned her tablet for viruses and it said there were none. It also doesn’t seem to be a hardware issue with the wires because it happened immediately after the game crashed and the lines haven’t been moving around the screen or changing colors. 

She lives in the Caribbean and doesn’t drive, so she can’t easily take it to a shop to have it looked at and we’re hoping to see if anyone has ever experienced this before and knows how to resolve it before she drives across her country to take it to a technician.

I’ve been vaping since 2019 and the longest I quit was 1 week for my honey moon. Started out as a social thing but become a bit habit. Tried to quit many times but always caved.

I decided that enough was enough when I started to scab vape hits off my friends when mine ran out.  I would go through one vape a week and get incredibly anxious without one. Two months ago something flipped in my brain and I decided to slowly cut down my vape intake. It was tough but for a month I slowly decreased my daily hits and got to the point where I tried to stop all together and it’s been amazing and my urges to vape have basically vanished this time. The difference being I truly want to quit this time.

The first week was tough and had negative side effects but pushed through and those desires vanished quickly.

I am already seeing some amazing benefits that I wanted to share to hopefully motivate others.

- Reduced brain fog and head feels clear 
- Average resting heart rate is going down
- much lower heart rate on my usual morning walk to get a coffee
- I’m getting better sleep quality and really vivid dreams, I’m waking up refreshed 
- increased motivation and desire to improve my life in other ways 
- workout effort improved in the gym 
- I don’t feel guilty hiding my habit from family and scabbing off friends 
- sense of smell improved 
- taste buds improved 
- many more 


I have noticed the main side effect is my body craving more caffeine as a way to get its dopamine fix

**-DET Pistons v NO Pelicans Under 233.5 (-110)** ✅



A special thanks to the Pelicans for somehow being even *worse* out there tonight than I thought they'd probably be (LOL!) Harsh, I know – but *damn*. That was tough to watch. Of course, Trae Murphy III making his exit in the first few minutes of the game certainly didn't hurt our pick either.

Enjoy your win, betting family – and on to the next we go!

\--

The morning bustled with energy at the Orc Café's booth. Breakfast had never been a festival highlight, but now that the café was serving lattes and BLTs, it had become an instant hit. The line only died down when the morning stories began.

A lone figure dressed in all purple stood patiently in line. Her deep purple eyes observed the Orcs and the lone imp hustling to keep up with the endless orders. She smiled, enjoying the sight. Once it was her turn, she stood, looking up at the much larger Orc taking orders.

""Good morning to you, Great Orc Bob,"" the purple figure said, smiling gently.

Bob shivered momentarily as if a cold wind had blown through the booth. Then he smiled at the little woman dressed in all purple, with purple hair and oddly purple eyes. ""Uh, good morning. What can I do for you?""

“I’ll take a vanilla latte,” the small woman said.

""Sure thing, name?"" Bob asked.

""Judy,"" the woman said. The crowd had seemed to quiet down.

""Uh, sure,"" Bob turned and yelled, ""Vanilla Latte for Judy!""

Rose shouted back, ""Vanilla latte for Judy, got it."" Rose got to work making the latte.

Judy handed the coins to Bob, who gladly accepted it. As Judy approached the left to await her order, he looked to the next customer.

“Vanilla Latte for Judy,” shouted Rick.

Judy raised her hand; she wasn't much taller than the imp, ""That's for me, Rick.""

""Here ya go,"" Rick handed her the latte, but for a moment, he felt a chill.

“Thank you, Quartermaster Rick,” Judy said, taking a sip and smiling. “Ah, excellent. By the way, one of today’s stories about Song. I thought you would want to hear about your ancestor.”

Rick was dumbfounded and nodded yes.

Well then, I’ll see you at noon by the fountain,” Judy said. “Have a good morning.” She sipped her coffee, smiled, and walked away.

Rick could only wave as she disappeared into the crowd.

""Rick!"" Rose shouted, ""Got another order. You okay?""

""Yeah, yeah,"" Rick said and went back to work.

\---

Later that day, it was time for the morning shift to have a break.

""Chief,"" Rick said, ""I'd like to leave for a bit to hear the story of Song.""

Chief Richard smiled, ""Of course, Rick.""

""Who's Song?"" Bob asked.

""Uh, Song is the greatest imp warrior,"" Rick said.

""Really, that's fascinating. Would you like some company,"" Rose asked.

""Yes!"" Rick yelped.

“Greatest imp warrior, huh?” Bob said. “So, imps went to war? With who, the gophers?” He laughed, earning a sharp glare from Rose.

Rick’s face turned red with embarrassment.

“Shut up, Great Orc Bob,” Rose snarled.

“Okay, you two. Rose, Bob likes the little guy. He’s just messing with him,” Chief Richard said, stepping between them. ""I think we should all go. Honestly, I would like to know more about them.""

Bob scratched his head. ""Yeah, sorry, Rick. I was just joking around. I'm with Chief; I want to know more, too.""

Rick smiled, ""Thank you, I would be honored if you heard her story.""

The orcs and the imp settled on benches before the stage next to the fountain. The benches were larger than the one for Battleax. The orcs smiled and joked as the crowd gathered around. Bob was impressed at the many different species that had come to hear the story.

Two hooded purple figures approached the stage. The crowd settled down as the two figures climbed up the stairs. Both were small by Orc comparison, but one was smaller than the other. They stood in the middle of the stage and pulled back their cloak. One figure was an imp whose fur had a hint of purple. The other was Judy.

Judy raised her hands. “Attention, everyone. Today, we will hear the story of Song of the Ong clan, the ghost, the savior, and the warrior. Her tale will be told by Song’s direct descendant, Yong.” Judy bowed her head and left the stage.

Judy approached the orcs and Rick. “Rick, may I sit with you and Rose for the story?”

Rick glanced at Rose, who looked just as surprised. “Sure, please.”

""Thank you,"" Judy sat between Rick and Bob.

Yong raised her hands. ""Today, we will tell the story of my grandmother, who lived many generations ago. It is the Song of the Ong clan, the runt.""

\---

Song stood beside her brother Zong, the youngest of the Ong clan. Imps named their children alphabetically after their clan; it was their way of practicing their ABCs. When Zong was born, Mother Ong declared she was done having children. The siblings cheered, relieved they wouldn’t have to deal with names like AAong or Aong, which would have been a nightmare to keep straight.

Song didn't like that her youngest brother was twice her size. She was the smallest of the Ong clan. They called her runt. She hated it. She also hated being her clan's smallest, slowest, and weakest. The clan tried to vote her out, but Mother Ong wouldn't allow it.

The men came in the middle of the night. The clan had never been attacked by humans before. They tried to fight back, but the men had armor and weapons beyond the rocks and sticks that the Ong clan had. Plus, the men had a mountain troll. Song had never seen a troll before. When it was over, Song was alone. No one knows if it was that she was too small to notice or too small to enslave for the mines. What we do know is that leaving her was a mistake.

Song tracked the humans and her clan for days. She ate bugs and roots. Thankfully, the humans were not in a hurry and stayed on the main roads. Any humans they passed weren't concerned about the imps in chains. Enslaving what was considered a lesser race was common practice in this area at that time.

The clan was taken to a coal mine dug into a mountain. They were put to work immediately. Song stayed at the perimeter of the mine watching. Not only was her clan there, but there were other imp clans, a few dwarves, trolls, a few orcs, a single elf, and humans! Song was surprised to see humans shackled like the rest. Even the mountain troll she had seen attacking her village was shackled. She wondered why it didn't snap the iron chains and attack, but it seemed docile like many others.

Song waited and watched. She stole food from the captors, who blamed it on rats. Soon, she found out who the leader was. He was an imposing human named Kevin. She had heard some of the guards shouting his name. She watched Kevin closely. She made a point of stealing more food from him.

Months later, Song sat in the mountains, watching the camp from above. She had several small camps around the mine so the men wouldn't notice her. Movement caught her attention. A jolt of fear shot through her when she saw the snake. It was one of the poisonous ones they were warned to avoid. Thankfully, it wasn't interested in her.

She watched as the snake hunted a small rodent. Song felt sorry for the small thing. She knew what it was like to be that small. The snake slowly stalked its prey, and then it struck. Song's heart jumped, knowing that the little rodent was dead, but instead, she saw the snake fly back, and the rodent got away. Song couldn't believe what she saw.

Song closely watched the rodents and snakes any night she slept in the mountains. One night, she saw it again. This time, she was more prepared and saw that the rodent jumped and twisted in the air when the snake struck. While the rodent was twisting, it kicked the snake away. An idea sparked in her mind.

Song began to train. She started by jumping. Soon, she could jump and twist. After a few weeks, she could jump, twist, and kick. She was getting the hang of imitating the rodent she had watched. Unfortunately, her jumping was noticed.

The attack was swift, and Song was taken by surprise. The only thing that saved her was she was ready to spring into another jump. The blow spun her in mid-air, and she landed hard but more or less on her feet. The large cat hissed as it prepared for another attack.

The cat jumped, but Song was ready this time. She jumped and twisted away from the creature. She kicked out, striking it hard in the head. The cat hit the ground hard, and Song landed on her feet. She was breathing hard, and her vision was blurred.

The cat roared again and jumped. Song also jumped, but this time, she could aim her feet better and strike the cat in the head. It hit the ground hard again. This time, Song was ready. She jumped, somersaulting over the cat while extending her claws. She dug her sharp nails into the cat's side, creating large gashes. The cat screeched out in pain.

It again tried to turn for another jump, but Song was ready. She flipped over the cat again, slicing its neck and back with her claws. The large cat screeched again, but it was slowing down.

The cat stood once more while Song stared it down. It attempted a step forward but failed and collapsed. Song grabbed the sharp stick she had kept with her and stabbed the large cat deep into its heart.

Breathing heavily, she stood over her slain opponent. There was no time to celebrate; torches flickered in the distance, and human voices drew near. Her heart pounding, Song bolted into the tall grass, crouching low as she watched.

""Look at that!"" a man said. ""I thought these things didn't have predators.""

""They don't,"" Kevin said, ""whatever did this was strong.""

""It looks fresh,"" Another man said.

The men became quiet. Song could hear them shuffling around the body of the large cat.

""I don't see anything,"" a man said.

""Doesn't matter. Nothing comes near the mines."" Kevin said. ""Well, looks like fresh meat is on the menu tonight.""

The men laughed and cheered as they took the cat with them.

Song waited until she knew they were long gone. Her vision had cleared except for her left eye. She touched her face and found blood on her hands. She rushed to a small pool nearby.

With the moons now in full bloom, she could see clearly. She had four claw marks down her brow and across her cheek. She washed her wounds and her left eye. Her vision became clear once the blood was gone. She looked at her reflection carefully. The wound was deep, but thankfully, it missed her eye. She looked savage. She felt savage.

It was time. She had a plan to get her clan back.

We work at a grocery store he works at the deli I work at the coffee shop. He kept insisting on giving me his number til I finally decided I wanted it. 
I had just started going through a breakup which I’ve been very transparent about where I’m at. He was being super sweet and supportive after we started texting. We had been flirting and he comes by my cafe sometimes to bring me treats (one time he brought me surprise ice cream), and every shift we work together on his last break he’ll come ask how my day is and give me some kinda cute compliment. He gives me old timey nick names in our texts like suga and honey and we’ve learned that we share a lot of similar goals and values ie having a family, valuing spirituality, sobriety, (we’re both more newly sober this last year), health, etc. the weird thing is that I’m not one to usually go for Tauruses? 
I’m an Aquarius sun, but I have a Scorpio moon, and both Pisces and Scorpio stellium. Idk his placements yet— I guess not trying to go there too soon lmao. 
Oh fast foreward we went on a pretty hike last week and made out on the top of the mountain… and today I went over to his place and we cuddled/had sexy fun/he cooked me dinner and we cuddled more and watched a movie for a bit til we needed to part ways. 
Idk. I’m probably over thinking. I’m trying to take things slow and keep focusing on me. He mentioned he’s attracted to my confidence and how I’m putting myself first and I’m attracted to him for the same things.
Do you think he’s really into me or do u think he just wants some sexy fun? Like we haven’t known each other that long but our connect feels very natural and we both seem to be very attracted to each other. Idk. I’m trying to take things slow and not let my Scorpio side get too excited / obsessive haha but it feels nice and I feel like he likes me and it feels healthy on my side.

1jduq2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1jduq2b/i_played_ever_dark_age_including_some_doubledark/,"I played ever dark age, including some double-dark ages. Here's what I think.","tldr: I like dark ages but maybe needs a more consistent design pass (esp science dark ages) - some are hard to unlock without being really behind while others are super easy to unlock without losing too much  
best overall design: dark military exploration  
worst overall design: dark science modern

I wanted to try out every single dark age, including doing double-dark ages (as in, pick dark age in exploration and modern). They might not be the most optimal civ-leader combos as I had other considerations (I wanted to play Ada and Carthage as they were just released, for e.g.) - just wanted to see how the mechanics would play out..

I'll try to give brief explanations of the dark age mechanics for those completely unfamiliar - if you have specific questions ask me in the comments. Dark ages are basically a legacy option when you transition into exploration and modern, without meeting the first milestone in any of the legacy paths in the prior age. Example - building less than 2 wonders in antiquity gives you the option of a cultural dark age in exploration. When you pick one, you cannot pick any other legacy option, including other dark and golden ages, attribute points, etc. except for change capital

Disclaimer: I played on Sovereign as I find it the most fun difficulty currently.

# First run- dark eco exploration; Ada - Rome - Spain - Great Britain

Dark eco exploration - every 2 levels on your naval commander grants you a settle action on that commander (basically Legatus on naval), settlers cost more to train  
**Unlocking it:** this dark age is really hard to intentionally get - I can see it being an interesting strategy to settle locations focusing a certain terrain type (at the expense of more resources), but if the intention is for this to help players who are behind on resources, I think the first milestone is too easy to get - slotting 7 resources - so players have to be reallly really behind to not get this (esp because you automatically slot valid resources when a settle claims the tile. Even harder if you're trying to do it on purpose (i.e. youre not actually that behind) as it's for e.g. easy to ""not build wonders"" or ""not pick masteries/narratives that give you codices"" even if you're ahead.  
**Strong/Weak?** It's quite good - if you keep a constant xp stream to two or three naval commanders by independent people (IP) hopping (and eventually, taking AI cities by the coast), I find the settling frequency quite in line with settlement limit increases (through tech/civics), and - you're already at pretty good locations where you got xp (from clearing IPs). It also makes a lot of sense for getting strong treasure fleet settles faster than anyone else as you dont have to build and move settlers - so the penalty doesn't even matter. The only downside is you can't do settles away from coast/navigable rivers  
**Fun?:** Yes, esp with Spain (I got suppppper lucky with my first conquistador, iykyk); I can see Chola being a fun combo as well.

# Second run - dark culture exploration into dark science modern; Catherine - Han- Shawnee - Russia

Dark culture exploration - missionaries get +1 move and +1 charge, -3 happiness in all settles after founding a religion; -6 in settles not following your religion;  
**Unlocking it:** Pretty easy - just don't build more than 1 wonder (probably just your civs associated wonder or gate of all nations). I picked Han so I could focus entirely on building a humongous great-wall that would basically propel my culture into perpetuity, and wonders would only get in the way, tbh.  
**Strong/Weak?** Above average - I played this combo (i.e. with Shawnee) because I wanted to see what would happen if I got 100% conversion (spoilers, you only get one more founder belief, and you can't even golden age both in modern). I did get pretty good early yields on my religion and so many relics quickly, but I think it was the big great wall + serpents mound + forbidden city that basically won me the game  
**Fun?:** yes contingent on you liking religion, which is a pretty underbaked mechanic atm - I thought it was ok to try one time.

Dark science modern - unlocks flight with combustion, air units cost more to train  
**Unlocking it:** this one actually sucks hard - it's very hard to not accidentally get this because it requires a lot of calculation or not placing any specialists at all (also hard, and suboptimal), and you literally cannot get a single tile with >40 yield.  
**Strong/Weak?** Pretty weak, it basically let's you start aerodrome/trans-oceanic flight earlier, that's it. I suppose unlocking airplanes is good, but the penalty makes it hard to use anyway  
**Fun?:** Not really, but also I may have been so ahead by modern I don't feel the science struggle very much.

# Third run - dark military exploration into dark eco; Napoleon Emeperor - Khmer - Mongolia - Prussia

Dark military exploration - lose all your settlements except your capital (your existing or the one you click change capital to), lose all your existing armies and army commanders (fyi, you keep independent units as much as your settles still!), start with three army commanders packed with cavalry and siege  
**Unlocking it:** since you're going to lose everything but your capital, this is quite OK to unlock, the plan for me was simply get a couple of food heavy towns to boost my super capital (why I picked Khmer), which spammed wonders and specialists to make sure I could start on slightly better culture/science/gold in exploration  
**Strong/Weak?** Strong but situational (thats good design I think!) - if you have juicy targets nearby, especially strong cities with horses, this snowballs much faster. It's harder to use it for, ironically, distant land captures for the military golden age. You'll also realize you don't have that much influence for war support (because you'll at max have one monument and villa to start) right from the get go, so the first few picks count for a lot, and previous age bad relationships are good (why I picked napoleon). The very obvious pick for this is mongols. I can see normans as a potentially good one for doing a distant lands version of the strat.  
**Fun?:** of course (unless you hate war and only like optimal settles where you can plan everything - i.e. not ai/other people settles) I would say it kind of trivializes the antiquity age (though Id argue if you play a super capital/lose territory to other plays actually this is OK)

Dark eco modern - 100% Production and Gold towards building or purchasing Rail Stations and Ports as well as +1 Resource Capacity in all settlements, but -25% Culture;

**Unlocking it:** easy - don't get treasure fleet points (or if you did mongolia dark military, don't even conquer/settle outside of your homelands!), very viable  
**Strong/Weak?** strong - the downside is somewhat harsh but for eco victory types this just makes it that much faster. The fact that there is a viable way of not being behind to unlock it (i.e. don't play treasure fleets) makes it that much stronger (tea and chocolate are the only factory resources you aren't going to get without distant lands), but I found enough coffee/cotton/citrus/quinine/fish/kaolin to not care too much. Also, with prussia, this double dark age strat was more effective because I can trade for more resources even though everyone hates me/is at war! (+ they get railroad bonuses)  
**Fun?:** it's fun if you like ""speed-running"" type gameplay - it basically made eco victory ""win more/faster"" and was very smooth. I do, so this was fun for me.

# Fourth run - dark science exploration into dark military modern; Augustus - Carthage - Chola - Mughal

Dark science exploration - Dark Age: Gain a random technology boost every five turns, but -50% Science.

**Unlocking it:** relatively OK  - you have to intentionally not pick tech masteries that give codices, which for the most part most of the masteries I want don't involve codices anyway  
**Strong/Weak?** this one just sucks, or I'm not sure how to play around it enough. It's like a weaker civ 6 babylon? I guess the idea is you can randomly get techs you want faster, (or you can purposely play into them), but you are somewhat incentivized to neglect science? I suppose if you have a flexible plan - like if you get wharf early you'll go distant lands faster, if you get machinery maybe you'll do this, etc.  
**Fun?:** kind of? not really? might need a design pass? maybe if you like random?; My plan ended up being to neglect science in favor of spamming units and commanders (why I picked chola) to set up for my military dark age in modern (so because I had no science, I could spam the less upgraded unit anyway, though im not sure if it costs less), so it worked out.

Dark military modern - Dark Age: Gain two levels on all Commanders and new Commanders start out with two levels, but +25% Production cost for all military units.

**Unlocking it:** pretty easy - just don't settle too much distant lands and definitely don't convert them to your religion  
**Strong/Weak?** strong with setup - I basically had enough settle limit and enough commanders that i could potentially just declare multiple wars and take every city I needed instantly once I hit an ideology - i couldnt because I didnt set up enough denounces early to mass declare formal wars - I actually wanted to do Great Britain (because of my massive setup navy in exploration -> Revenge) but there's a bug so I went for Mughal because I wanted to *buy* the manhattan project (also, fitting because the overused quote is from the bhagavad gita, not exactly mughal but on the subcontinent I suppose)  
**Fun?:** yes, executing this plan was very fun

# Fifth run - dark modern culture; Friedrich Baroque - Egypt  - Ming - Buganda

Dark culture modern - Dark Age: +1 Movement and +50% Excavation Speed for Explorers, but -50% Influence.

**Unlocking it:** easy - ignore religion, very viable to get culture from other sources (why I chose ming)  
**Strong/Weak?** mixed? I think with the slightly reworked modern cultural victory, it actually does make a difference that your explorer ""gets there first"", but to me it's more about luck and how many explorers you can buy rather than movement, so maybe this needs a slight rework (e.g. unlock free/cheaper explorers after building a wonder or something), the influence penalty is pretty painful, esp when compared to the dark eco modern (-25% culture is much less painful)  
**Fun?:** \~eh, because we get less explorers now, and because you can get artifacts through other means, you don't interact with it much, so it's not that fun. Also, I should probably be using railroads more to shift explorers... (my own fault) I picked friedrich - buganda partially to get the artifacts even faster (by conquest, and pillaging for culture)

# Closing thoughts

I *think* the devs tried to design dark ages such that it helps players in weaker positions rubber-band into a golden age for the same-type legacy path - I think this vision was met for all but the science exploration dark age. However, culture, military and eco modern dark ages are really easy to get while *not* behind (ignore religion or distant lands, not that much penalty), so it's a bit weird because it becomes a powerful *all-in* option for a modern victory rather than a Im behind and need to catch up mechanic. (maybe what needs to change is to make those paths stronger, like treasure fleets giving crap-tons of gold and or resources) That said, you do lose out on all the points you did get if you pick it, so the intention is still for you to be behind to pick it. But also, some of them are really fun and I want to pick it even though Im ahead? The science ones are also not as creative or well designed as I think they can be. Also, because you lose all your other points and take a dark-age penalty, it's probably not that good (but of course, you can't make it better than a golden age, otherwise what's the point). I think maybe some of these problems would be addressed by a smarter/more difficult AI forcing me to really consider dark ages in that setting (I don't play on deity so that's partly it)

-1 coffee with soy milk (no sugar)

1jdudni,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jdudni/i_dont_think_i_love_my_mother_anymore/,I dont think i love my mother anymore,"I've always had a weird relationship with my mom but she keeps getting worse as i grow more dependent on her/others. My dad is neglectful and abusive, me and my siblings were socially isolated by him up until middle school and everything had to be on his terms. Obviously my mom wasn't getting what she needed from that marriage so she turned to me for emotional support, which i think would have been at least a little bit better if she was also my emotional support and it didn't start with her begging me to hide her self harm from my father. All this to say i have been a secondary spouse to her for almost ten years. I am 21 years old. 

I've had multiple suicide attempts, at least 2 complete breaks from reality (most recently i was up for 3 days and turned our bathtub into my bed) and no matter how many times i tell her to please take me somewhere next time this happens, she always always listens to me mid breakdown. that I'm fine. that i don't need help, I'll be ok. i am not in my right mind when i say these things, i am a danger to myself and others when i say these things, and she listens every single time. When am i supposed to believe I'm going to get help. Once i thought maybe if i just opened myself up more that would fix it, that i wasn't communicating right, instead when i told her my only saving grace was my inability to walk she told me i could crawl. How am i supposed to ask for help after that. 

I've come out of therapy appointments and the first thing out of her mouth will be about her struggles at work, didn't even ask me how it went. And 9 times out of 10 when she did remember to ask, she didn't really listen to what i had to say and brushed right past it to complain about her coworkers. Not to mention if i want her to acknowledge and change her behavior i absolutely MUST do so in a complement sandwich or else I ""hurt her feelings and really don't appreciate being spoken to that way"" and I'm made to feel guilty for standing up for myself and my boundaries. 

She put ME in charge of her cigarette/alcohol consumption (like she would ask me if she was allowed to smoke/drink, which would normally sound considerate but the way she went about it was weird to me) and when she does drink she calls me her soulmate and the love of her life. Just hearing her say the words 'i love you' is enough to send me into a panic anymore. when i say it back it feels like a lie. I barely feel my own emotions because they simply aren't a priority, which i guess i don't help but i feel like i shouldn't have to beg my own mother to think about my feelings. 

This is also all happening while i watch her drive my younger sibling halfway across the state for a 40 min doctors appointment. They get to go to urgent care because of a pain that they've always had. When there have been nights where i'm in so much pain i can only sob. One time i was so sick and i had been puking for so long i was worried about dehydration; she spiked her coffee right before urgent care opened, despite me saying i wanted to go when they did. I've slowly been losing my ability to walk and as its progressed shes been treating me more and more like a burden. I'm prone to falling, one day she caught me and accidentally hurt her arm and guess what that incident has been about since. I'm so scared and I'm sick of being scared without even my mom to hold my hand through it. ",2,1742263481.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

1jduc2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jduc2q/first_completed_bingo_card_with_a_few_comments/,First Completed Bingo Card with a few comments,"This is my first year doing Bingo.  I completed two hard mode cards this year.  To increase the challenge, for one card, all books had to be available through Kindle Unlimited. I pay for the service--I want to get my money's worth.  (Note: some books were available through KU at the time I read them but have been pulled from the service now.  I still counted them.)  The other card was mostly books I bought, but some I borrowed and some I'd owned for years.  Overall I found Bingo a great way to expand my reading horizons.  Across the two cards, I read a lot of books that I probably wouldn't have otherwise, and while I hated a couple, I liked or loved quite a few more.

  
**My favorites:**

**Jade City by Fonda Lee (Multi-POV--KU card):**  Family saga that reads like a mix of the Godfather and martial arts. Also counts as one of the books I probably wouldn't have read without Bingo, but it was my favorite on my KU card.  I loved it and raced through the entire trilogy.  Great characters.

**Ancillary Justice by Anne Leckie (Space Opera):**  I'd heard of these books for years but never gotten around to picking them up.  I usually don't like books told across two timelines, but it really worked for me here.  The mystery of what happened to Justice of Toren in the past and what Breq is working to in the present merged very well.  I also enjoyed the two direct sequels and plan to read the others in the world soon.

**Foreigner by CJ Cherryh (First in series):**  Another author I'd always meant to read about a translator who lives as the lone human among an alien race.  I bought Foreigner back in 2020 when it was on sale, but then bounced off the opening.  This time I made it through to Bren and then lost the next three weeks of my life binge reading all 21 books in the series.  I'm hoping to branch out to some of her other works this year.

**Cascade Failure by L.M. Sagas (Published in 2024):**  I see the flaws in this book (the worldbuilding is a little--vague--at times) but I don't care. I love the characters.  It feels like Firefly to me.  I read the sequel the day it dropped and I want more books with these characters.  Not a perfect book, but a perfect fit for me.

**The Raven Boys by Maggie Stiefvater (Dark Academia):**  Young adult series, but less annoying than a lot of YA books.  Really lovely writing.  As is a theme, for me, I really loved the characters and therefore I loved the books.  I did feel the ending to the 4th book was a little weak, but I still really enjoyed getting there.

**The Bone Harp by Victoria Goddard (Bards):**  I've liked, but not loved some of her other books, so I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this one.  The middle section was a little slow but the writing was poetic and the characters were lovely.  I understand it's related to the Silmarillion, but I've only read the Hobbit and the main Trilogy so it stood alone for me.

  
**Books I would never have picked up without Bingo, but really liked:**

**A Letter to the Luminous Deep by Sylvie Cathrall (Under the Surface--KU card):**  Epistolary novel as a woman and a man try to make sense of a tragedy that led to the disappearance of his brother and her sister.  It's a slow paced book and charming is the word that I would use to describe it..  There's an open ending and presumably more questions will be answered in the upcoming sequel.

**Cursed Cocktails by S.L. Rowland (Prologues and Epilogues--KU card)**:  A retired soldier retires south, sets up a bar and falls in love.  (Totally different then Legends and Lattes-- cocktails, not coffee!)  Despite feeling like this is a *very* specific genre of books, I actually like this better than L&L--there's more focus on Rhoren integrating into the community and there's more going on around him.  Nice, cozy read.  I also liked the (very loosely connected) sequel but not quite as much.

**The Doctrines of Fire by C.L. Jarvis (Dark Academia--KU card):**  Murder and magic at the Edinburgh Medical School in 1779.  This book takes a lot of real historical people and medical controversy of the time and throws in magic.  (Two doctors really did have a big blow up over the causes and treatment of gout at the time--there was a lot less fire magic involved in the real histories.)  I liked it but I teach at a medical school, so the drama and humor around faculty appointments and journal clubs hit for me in a way they might not for everyone.  I've read a couple more of the series, but not the most recent.

**The Heretics's Guide to Homecoming (Bookclub):**  Very different style from my usual reads with themes around mental health (severe anxiety).  I mostly enjoyed the main character even though sometimes the anxiety spiral was represented a little too well.  I didn't like the sequel quite as much.

**A Face Like Glass by Frances Hardinge (Under the Surface):**  This book and author were never on my radar, but I wanted none horror books for the under the surface category and found this suggested in the recommendations section.  Very unique world.



**Books I thought I'd like but didn't:**

**Hench by Natalie Zina Walschots (Character with a Disability--KU card):**  A temp agency worker for villians is badly injured by a superhero then uses spreadsheets and research to help her get revenge.  I didn't like it at all--mainly because I hated almost all the characters.  There was like one or two minor side characters that weren't awful, but overall, bleah.  It's not necessarily abad book, but it's not for me.

**The Palace Job by Patrick Weekes (Criminals--KU)**:  Classic heist--break out of prison, assemble a gang of talented misfits and steal the artifact.  There's magic and prophecy and magical beings and it's supposed to be funny.  Lots of people seem to like this book, but it *dragged* for me.  Some of the world building was cool, but I read for characters and despite multiple very distinct characters they all bored me.  I didn't *hate* it, but there's no chance I'm reading the rest of the series.2nd card

**A Master of Djinn by P. Djeli Clark (Author of Color):**  I usually like fantasy mysteries (loved The Tainted Cup for example).  The worldbuilding was amazing.  I didn't enjoy the characters and (unusually for me) figured out villian well ahead of the characters which just made me feel like they weren't that bright.



**Book I absolutely hated:**    
**Court of Winter by Krista Street (Judge a Book by its Cover--KU):**  This is the worst book I've read in years.  As seen by my scores for several other books on this card, I like romance.  I hated this book.  It's the stupidest kind of enemies to lovers >!Sure, the prince killed your parents and is actively kidnapping you, but in between your episodes of hating him you're going to sit around and think about how hot he is!< and the ""twists"" are easy to see coming. >!the king might as well as put a flashing sign over his head labeled ""bad guy""  !<I only finished this because all the covers I like seem to be Romantasy and I wasn't sure it would get better if I tried again.



There were quite a few other books I really enjoyed and quite a few that were pleasant but unmemorable.

Overall I had more books I really loved on my non-KU card, but having to find books on KU really pushed me further out of my usual reading patterns.  I ended up finding some books I really liked that way.  I can't wait to see the new card April 1st.",4,1742263345.0,Fantasy,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I want to put an L shaped shelf above my coffee bar. I was going to buy some solid hardwood like acacia or walnut and just put a finish on it and put it up, but a two inch thick piece of lumber is insanely expensive here. I don't want to go with something smaller than 1.5-2"" because it's going to have cook books on top of it and I think the shelf will look bad with a thinner piece of wood.

So now I'm thinking of making the shelves out of 3/4"" ply and covering the edge with a nicer lumber. I want to put a border around the plywood of the nice hardwood with the face grain pointing out. So the question is, would it look really weird if I have 3/4"" ply with 2"" of hard wood around the edges? To be clear this would mean there would be a 1.25"" over hang where there's nothing behind the hardwood. Additional question, if I did it this way, should I then stain the plywood as close as I can to the color of the hardwood? Or should I just accept this is the price of being a wood worker in Hawaii and pay for the big piece of hard wood?

1jdu6uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/interiordecorating/comments/1jdu6uo/apartment_color_scheme_help/,Apartment Color Scheme Help!,"Long post, so sorry! First time poster here hoping to get some assistance from the hive mind.

My husband and I have lived in apartments of varying sizes our entire relationship. We've moved a lot and thus have never bothered much with planning or decorating in any real meaningful way, meaning each place has been the same boring cookie-cutter neutrals as all the previous one. We're moving again in June, and because we have both moving- and boring-apartment-fatigue, we've made an agreement to change that this time, in hopes that personalizing the space will make it feel more permanent and more like 'home.'

I really want to make it special and put a lot of thought into it, and am willing to also put a lot of work into making it beautiful; this includes apartment-friendly updates like peel and stick wallpaper, shelving, art, rugs, peel and stick backsplash, and switching hardware (cabinet handles etc). But before I can even plan, I feel like I'm getting stuck on the first thing: finding a color scheme that will work and feel cohesive between spaces.

I've got one bedroom to plan for (the master, the other will be my husband's office which he can do whatever he wants with lol), and the main space, which is a kitchen-dining-living open floor plan. I would like those two spaces to feel similar if not necessarily the same, with complimentary schemes. 

Luckily, like most apartments, I have an almost blank canvas to work with: the walls are white, the floors a light-wash laminate 'hardwood,' and the carpet (in the bedrooms) grey. The appliances are stainless steel, and the cabinets are a rich medium wood (though I'm def willing to change them w/ contact paper). Grey-ish granite counter tops. 

Similarly, we have a few 'key' pieces of furniture etc to plan around, all of which are equally easy, and freedom beyond that:

For the living space, our couch is a medium grey, our dining, coffee, and end tables all wood w/ black accents. The dining chairs need replacing, so they can be whatever color we want. Our dining rug (which I love and would like to keep) is a light neutral color with beautiful sky-blue accents, but we need a new living rug so ditto on the 'it can be whatever we want.' 

For the bedroom, we have a very good-quality dark blue comforter I'd like to plan around, but I am happy to buy new sheets. Our headboard is a charcoal grey/black, our side tables and dresser wood w/ black accents. 

From there, our art/pottery/etc (which can go in either room) is limited, but mostly black and grey, light blue, dark blue, and a couple of rust / terracotta pieces. 

My favorite aesthetic is 'Dark Naturalism,' so I would love for the whole place to sit in that kind of dark, moody/gothic niche. With that in mind, I keep coming back to using dark green (my favorite color), dark blue (due to the bedding), and light blue (given the rug and other accents), but I can't decide what would pair best beyond that.

Any and all suggestions are welcome! Also feel free to drop tips on fleshing out decor (art pieces, other small details), as well as your experiences with some of the renter-friendly upgrades mentioned above.

1jdu3kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/1jdu3kg/update_sf_ice_cream_march_madness_lactose/,Update: SF Ice Cream March Madness (Lactose Warriors Edition),"Armed with a Costco sized pile of lactase and an iron will, my fiancé, friend, and I braved the rain yesterday to complete our SF Ice Cream Bracket in one single, sugar fueled day. Was this a good idea? Probably not. Would we do it again? Also probably not. But was it fun? Absolutely.

A few key takeaways:

Garden Creamery had Ube Pandan, which scored 5 out of 5, and Velvety Chocolate, which scored 4.5 out of 5. The texture was smooth, and the flavors were rich with just the right amount of sweetness.

Mitchell’s offered Mexican Chocolate, which earned a 5 out of 5, and Irish Cream, which got a 4 out of 5. Both were creamy and bold, but the Mexican Chocolate was my personal favorite of the entire bracket.

Polly Ann had Taro and Jasmine Tea, both scoring 3.75 out of 5. The flavors were promising but let down by multiple ice chunks. The lack of creaminess really held it back.

Milkbomb served Butter Brickle, which got a 4.5 out of 5, and Strawtella, which received a 4 out of 5. The Butter Brickle had great salty bits, but the Strawtella did not have nearly enough Nutella flavor.

Swensen’s featured Turtle Caramel Fudge with a score of 4 out of 5 and Turkish Coffee with a score of 4.5 out of 5. My friend’s absolute favorite scoop of the day was the Turkish Coffee. The Turtle Caramel Fudge, on the other hand, had an oddly melted taste that was a little off-putting.

Hometown Creamery had Crescent City Bread Pudding, which scored 2 out of 5, and Finnegan's Wake Cake, which got 3.5 out of 5. This was the biggest disappointment of the bunch. The ice cream had lots of ice chunks and left an oily film in my mouth.

Fiancé’s scores were politely excluded because *someone* refused to follow the agreed upon scoring system. Next time we will space things out over a few days and maybe pick a drier weekend, but overall, this was a chaotic yet fantastic way to spend a day.

Obviously, these are just the opinions of two people with a strong preference for creamy, bold flavors. If you love lighter, more subtle flavors, your rankings might look very different. But if you're a fellow fan of rich and velvety ice cream, this bracket might help you find your next favorite scoop.

Would highly recommend trying this, but maybe with a little more self-control.

1jdu2eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1jdu2eg/when_did_kiryu_learn_english/,When did Kiryu learn English?,"Towards the end of Yakuza 3, Kiryu talks with the main villain: poorly dubbed Albert Wesker ripoff guy. Not-Wesker talks to Kiryu in fluent, natively pronounced (but poorly voice-acted) American-dialect English. Based on his responses, Kiryu clearly understands this guy, even if he responds in Japanese instead of English. So when did Kiryu learn to understand English? 

It's not like they teach a comprehensive course or anything over in Japan; I lived there for 7 months and NOBODY spoke English unless they worked in a bar/restaurant near a military base, or on said base. I literally learned Japanese while I was over there because it was easier than trying (and failing) to explain what I want to the waitress who clearly doesn't speak my language. All those ""erm they learn English in school"" statements are clearly BS if you've ever lived over there; they learn English like the avg bored American highschooler learns Spanish (ZERO language retention after graduating). 

My headcanon is that Kazama taught him a little, he learned some more from an English-speaking prisoner while spending 10 years in the joint (made you fucking fluent), studied more during the Kiwami 2 Gravure minigame (you literally just have to form coherent sentences). Then due to his rapid learning ability (literally learning a fighting style from witnessing a woman throw a dude once), he quickly picked it up from the local Marines when he moved to Okinawa. Before Morning Glory, he got a nice lil job at the PX on Hansen serving Einstein Bros bagels & coffee during the day, and slinging drinks at Saloon during the night. Spending so much time around English-speaking American Marines allowed him to learn English. Even if he's not great at speaking it, he can still fluently understand it. 

So unlike the average weaboo, Kiryu Kazuma can watch foreign media and understand the dialogue without needing translation subtitles in his native language. 

At least that's my headcanon, which makes sense given 1) Kiryu learns extremely fast and 2) There's a massive population of English speakers in Okinawa due to the military presence, so it's a great place for Japanese people to learn English irl [DO NOT teach the local bartenders ""motherfucker"" because they won't stop saying it for a week, then you get a text asking to come in and tell her to stop saying that word]. 

Idk what do you all think? Did Kiryu learn English in Okinawa or before? Or is this just one of those ""the characters just kinda understand because plot"" moments? 

Also I hate how the arms dealer Albert Wesker guy says the word ""roof"" tbh. It's ""rūūf"" with the OO from ""spoon"", not ""rùf"" with the OO from ""wood"" smfh. ",0,1742262543.0,yakuzagames,4,0.5,False
1jdu2e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1jdu2e8/living_a_mistake/,Living a mistake,"My grandpa used to say that young people always think they’re invincible. I knew he was right but it’s taken me some time to find it out for myself. 

A few years ago, not even knowing what I was doing, I wound myself up in a web of dishonesty that I’m still living in. I became close friends in my late teenage years with a girl, V — ever since then I’ve only been happy with her or when I’ve managed to completely forget about her. We never run out of things to talk about and all our shared experiences and inside jokes amount to their own mythology. For every day of the year there’s a memory, every season some overarching theme, every week a pattern of meeting; lately only the first one is surviving, and even then what used to be dense chunks of memories are thinning out to almost nothing. I’ve always been sensitive to lights around me, and if it would be too much to say that knowing her felt like seeing for the first time, I at least saw in her a whole new color, something more than what you could make from red, yellow, and blue. Whenever I saw her I would smile without even knowing what I was doing.  

But, being young and dumb, we both (or maybe it was only me) confused things eventually. I’ve kept things strictly platonic with girl friends before, and honestly feel more comfortable sometimes around them than guys, but with V I let things get out of control: more than a handful of times we stayed up too late texting, more often than not ending in an “I love you” and the stuttered goodbyes of people who don’t want to go but don’t want to pay for it the next day in tiredness. One time, just before we left for college, she was home and alone and invited me over. Actually, nothing happened. But I got the feeling of things going further than they should have — just the fact that there was something secretive and forbidden about it. We playfought. When I was leaving we stood there for a second in silence. Again, nothing happened with us, but between us there was a suggestion of something. I remembered how she broke up with her boyfriend a few months earlier. She said that knowing me made it impossible for her to forgive her boyfriend for his faults. Beneath the current of our friendship tides of jealousy, doubt, mistrust, control began punctuating with a picking-up pace our spare time. Since then, neither of us has dated seriously. Yet, we’re friends. Sometimes I don’t feel so strongly about it all, am in fact okay with how things are; other times I can’t call her a friend without feeling like a liar, and when she calls me a friend I wish she wasn’t so honest.  

We’re older now and only see each other when the holidays find us in our hometown. We go out for coffee in the afternoon and talk until they close up shop, no more than furniture to the employees. The last time we did this I came out ashamed of myself: I pride myself on being honest and sincere, yet my every word to her is hiding something. I don’t know what to do. Either I tell her that there’s enough of something else in my heart for her, or I keep on pretending. Maybe she’s pretending too? Neither of us has made many friends, and I have watched my life shrink to a few things and even fewer people.  

One time she told me she had a dream that I was her boyfriend. Another time she said she was thinking about what it would be like for us to date. Those were unsolicited. And yet in almost the same breath she called us friends. Those things haven’t happened for a while. 

It’s one of the mysteries of my life, yet to outside eyes maybe it’s all clear as day, I’m seeing something that’s not there, I’m really just a liar and have brought her down with me. One time we didn’t talk at all for a few days (no point in explaining why here), and afterwards she told me that she could only think about me and compulsively talked about me with her friends. I didn’t fare any better, seeing as those felt like some of the worst days of my life. 

I’m just afraid to admit how I’ve been feeling and destroy everything. But even if I don’t, maybe it’s destined to go eventually. 

Sorry, I feel like my writing is falling apart. I feel a lot better, like it's all leaving me, just having written this. I read a lot, write, spend hours outside walking, I play piano and sing. I’m glad she has never heard my music or my attempts at writing — I need those things for myself. Yet I often play a chord and feel her vibrating in my hands, or sing a high note and feel her crawling out of me, and I find her in every sentence somewhere along the way. ",4,1742262542.0,redscarepod,0,1.0,False

It's as though one of them is undercover, but I can’t quite tell if it's the guy I’ve been or the femboy I’m becoming. I’ve been dressing and going out a lot lately, feeling liberated in heels, buying clothes that reflect a side of me I’ve only recently dared to explore. I look at myself in the mirror at Zara—in a dress, heels, and a wig with full makeup—I don't see the guy I used to be. I see someone new. Someone with a different posture, a softer grace, a voice that lilts in a way I didn’t expect, and a magnetism that feels both foreign and intoxicating.

I’m caught between two worlds, and there’s this electric tension inside me that I can’t ignore. Since embracing the femboy side of myself, I've found myself drawn to men in ways I never have before, my heart fluttering when they approach, when their attention lingers. I went on a date once, a simple coffee shop meeting (nothing more). The whole time, his hand was on my thigh. I just let it happen without hesitation, feeling an unfamiliar excitement coursing through me. Then, he invited me back to his place to watch a movie. I knew what it would turn into. I could feel the weight of it—the anticipation, the heat. But something inside me held back. I wasn’t ready for that yet.

No one around me knows about this side of me, not my friends, not my family. This truth feels both exhilarating and confusing. And now, I’m questioning everything—who I was, who I am, and who I might be becoming.

I’ve been thinking about picking up a job at Starbucks as a barista, either part-time or full-time, and I’m trying to figure out whether I’d actually be making any real money at the end of the day. I know that on paper, Starbucks offers a set hourly wage, but I’m wondering how it all actually plays out when you factor in everything—taxes, potential tips, discounts, and any expenses that might come with the job (like having to buy coffee or food because you’re there all day).

For those of you who have worked (or currently work) at Starbucks, I have a few questions:
	1.	How much do you actually take home after taxes? Let’s say you work a typical shift—how much ends up in your bank account per week or per paycheck?
	2.	Are the tips significant enough to make a difference? I’ve heard mixed things about how the tip system works and how much baristas actually receive. Does it vary by location?
	3.	Does the employee discount save you a lot, or do you end up spending more money because you’re around coffee and food all day? Do you find yourself spending a chunk of your paycheck on Starbucks items?
	4.	Are there any hidden costs to the job? For example, are you expected to buy your own non-slip shoes or specific clothing? Do you have to pay for parking at work?
	5.	Is the pay enough to make the job worth it in your experience? Or do you feel like the pay isn’t enough considering the workload, customer interactions, and overall demands of the job?

I’m just trying to get a realistic idea of what I’d actually be walking away with after each shift, especially compared to other jobs that might pay similarly. Any insight would be super helpful! Thanks in advance.",0,1742261632.0,barista,9,0.5,False

Today, I'm looking at $74.55 ( 5th time ) payout from that same idea turned into a real product - SneakyGuy.

The Spark

It all started when I found myself spending 40+ hours monthly just tracking conversations on Reddit that were relevant to my interests. I thought: ""There has to be a better way to do this."" Turns out, there wasn't. So I decided to build it.

The Late Night Grind

My schedule became predictable in its insanity:

Weekdays: 9-5 at my day job, dinner, then coding from 8 PM until my eyes couldn't stay open

Weekends: Wake up, coffee, code. Occasionally remember to eat.

I converted my living room into a workspace where empty energy drink cans competed for space with scribbled notes about database architecture and API challenges.

The First Version

The first version of SneakyGuy was ugly. Really ugly. But it worked - it could scan Reddit for specific keywords and alert me when conversations matched my interests. When I showed it to a friend and they immediately asked ""Can I use this too?"" I knew I might be onto something.

From Project to Product

Turning a personal tool into a product meant:
Adding user accounts

Building an actual interface that didn't require developer knowledge

Setting up payment processing (harder than it sounds!)

Learning about things I never thought I'd need: privacy policies, terms of service, customer support systems

I didn't have a massive Product Hunt launch or viral Twitter thread. Instead, I mentioned SneakyGuy in comments where someone was asking about lead generation. Initially few signed up that day. One of them actually paid.

Challenge

As SneakyGuy grew, so did my database. We're now tracking over 62 million submissions across more than 1 million subreddits. Processing this data to find patterns like optimal posting times became both a technical challenge and a key feature.
Seeing that $74.55 payout notification wasn't about the money (though it will cover my hosting costs). It was validation that solving my own problem could create value for others too.

What I Learned

Start by solving your own problems authentically
Your first version just needs to work, not look pretty

Getting even one paying customer changes everything psychologically
Data becomes your competitive advantage
Progress happens in tiny increments that feel insignificant until you look back

For anyone considering the side project path: it's not about having more time than others, it's about what you choose to do with the limited time you have. Those weekend hours and late nights add up, but only if you keep showing up consistently.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jdtnq4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jdtnq4,When should I try training or repotting these pre bonsai?,"Hey everybody, been lurking here for a while, really interested in the hobby, having a hard time finding concrete information on the early stages of development, largely because all species have different needs, and I know Im not using necessarily the most common species for bonsai.

I’m new to the hobby, didn’t want to throw a ton of money into this, so I used mostly seeds I was able to find, and I live in a basement apartment, so Im space limited, I keep these guys under a grow light with my other plants, water them a little every day.

From left to right I’ve got:

1. Kentucky Coffee Tree… just  found the seed pods on a tree in my neighbourhood a few months ago… it grew to this height ver quickly, then I moved it to the pot its in now, and gave it this generic bonsai soil I got from amazon, its been looking good, but its not really grown since I repotted it.

2. Blue Jacaranda… these seeds I did buy, it was one if those amazon sets, it was the only one of the four species that grew though, its really pretty, its been growing pretty steadily, every so often a couple new branches, but it’s obviously still quite small, and I know it’s a tropical species, so it can probably continue on just fine on my shelf in its same little pot, from what I gather they’re relatively slow growing. I planted it around july/august

3. Apple Tree… I ate an apple, I took the seeds, I planted them, it was a red delicious apple, I know it’ll probably be a crab apple tree. I planted it also around august, and because I planted it late in the year, i didnt winter it, next winter though I will… It’s grown very quickly, very sudden, drastic spurts its had, but over the last few months he hasnt really grown at all, looks healthy, wondering if maybe it needs a bigger pot… the trunk has browned too, and feels relatively solid, all though I know its still thin. Is it too early to wire?

4. Lemon Tree… I had water at a restaurant, the lemon had a seed I planted it, more around october/november. Its grown very steadily, gotten pretty tall, that little leaf up top has been growing a little each day, so i figure its still in a good condition for growth, pot and soil wise (all the trees have the same soil btw)

So I guess just in summary, based on the pictures, and the conditions and statuses I’ve outlined, should I consider repotting any? (Especially the apple or kentucky coffee tree?). Its still a little chilly where I am, so the tropical trees I know, keep inside, and I dont want the other two to go into winter mode and then come back after like a week, is it worth though putting them outside? I dont really have outdoor space, so I guess more what Im wondering is is it worth asking my landlord, lol, and is the apple tree ready to wire? 

Id like to to get the trunks thicker, theyre obviously very young, is it worth putting any in larger pots to allow that to happen? Or is it too early and I can save the space for now.

Thanks for reading if you did! I know it was a goliath of a post, Im having a hard time finding good information out there for the stage of development my trees are at.

Oh, also, bonus, I cant find information on this either. I have a ficus moonshine, i know they call them rubber leaf trees or something like that… is it actually a tree? Can it be made into bonsai? I havent been able to find any examples online😅",1,1742261341.0,bonsaicommunity,3,1.0,False

I've been on this Java Burn ride for a while now, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my morning routine. Here's my take on it with all the deets you need.

**Java Burn Reviews: Real Talk Time** Alright, so I was skeptical at first, as we all are with these things, right? But after diving into Java Burn reviews, especially on consumer reports, I thought, Why not give it a shot?

**Java Burn Coffee: Elevating My Cup of Joe** So, what's the deal with Java Burn coffee? It's this dissolvable, tasteless packet you throw into your coffee, and bam, you've got this upgraded brew that's supposed to boost metabolism and energy. Intriguing, right?

**Java Burn Ingredients: Nature's Squad Goals** I did my homework on the ingredients – all-natural, vegetarian, gluten-free, and non-GMO. It's got this powerhouse combo that's supposed to set your metabolism on fire. Sounds like my kind of science!

**What is Java Burn? Unveiling the Magic** Java Burn is essentially this mix designed to amp up your metabolism when combined with coffee. It claims to torch fat, reduce hunger, and improve overall health. Bold promises, I know.

**Does Java Burn Work? My Experience** Okay, the million-dollar question. Does Java Burn actually work? For me, I'd say yes. I've been feeling more energized, noticed a bit of a reduction in those mid-morning cravings, and I swear my metabolism's doing a happy dance.

**Java Burn Complaints: Separating Fact from Fiction** Let's address the elephant in the room – complaints. I've seen some gripes, but honestly, most seem like folks not giving it enough time. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a supercharged metabolism.

**Reviews on Java Burn: Diverse Perspectives** I don't want you to just take my word for it. Dive into other Java Burn reviews for a broader picture. People's experiences vary, and it's good to get different perspectives.

**Is Java Burn a Scam? Spoiler Alert: Nah** With all the noise about scams, I get the hesitation. But from where I'm standing, Java Burn's delivering the goods without any shadiness.

**Java Burn Coffee Buy Online: My Go-To Move** Ordered mine online – smooth process. Amazon's got it, and it's a convenient way to get your hands on Java Burn without much fuss.

At one point, I had a morning routine for nearly a year where I would visit a local cafe near my place and would spend about $10-13 on a coffee and a croissant sandwich or bagel sandwich. 

I didn’t think much of it as I didn’t really didn’t feel any financial strain from it in my daily life but I eventually stopped and instead invested in a kuerig machine as I needed my morning coffee but didn’t need the food from the cafe. 

The money that would have been wasted on my daily routine, I instead put it into a savings account each day and at the end of the year, I did a lump sum payment on one of my school loans from all the saved up money in addition to the monthly payments and paid it off 6 years early. 

If you have any form of debt, what are some small simple lifestyle changes that you could make in your daily that would make a huge impact over time? If you don’t have any debt, what are some things you could do with $5,000 or even $4000 or $3000 from any saved up money?",6,1742261133.0,blackmen,2,0.8,False
1jdtko7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1jdtko7/la_fortuna/,La fortuna,"Hi all, just finished up my 2 full days in La fortuna. I I’m 21 and came with my family. We are splitting time between La Fortuna & an Air B&B in playa flamingo. 

We rented a car and drove from San Jose, I highly recommended renting a car. If you don’t you will be stuck taking small shuttles with lots of others. The roads are definitely narrow and windy but nothing too terrible. Definitely avoid traveling in the dark so aim to have an early landing flight.

We stayed at arenal manoa hit springs, great location near everything, a short drive from downtown. 

Regarding activities myself and my family loved canyoning. Maquique adventures was who we went with. Couldn’t recommend them more. It was $101 for around a 3 hour excursion, and it was worth every penny. It was a steep rocky road up to the place but they can also pick u up at your place of stay if you don’t have a 4x4. Canyoning should definitely be at the top of your list of things to do. It includes 5 repelling, 2 go down waterfalls, and there are multiple zip lines with Maquique. The guides are awesome and lunch is included at the end, it was amazing and authentic. 

I know I don’t have experience with other excursions but I read a lot on Reddit that all day tours are not worth it, and to stay away from sloth tours and coffee tours. You are better off to see a sloth on the side of road than pay money to walk around and see them. White water rafting was something we wanted to do but we never got the chance. I would look in this sub Reddit for recommendations on that. There is also a watering hole in town that has a rope swing, cool spot lots of people. 

You definitely should visit the La fortuna waterfall, it’s definitely a big spot amongst visitors but go early, aim to get there before 8 am and you will beat out the crowds. Really cool spot, water was cold but definitely go for a swim!

Food: by far the best meal we had was Jalapas. Stunning view, amazing food, and good prices. It’s definitely a rocky drive up here but it is 100% worth it. Try to make a reservation, around 30 mins before sunset for an amazing dinner. Everyone says sodas are good, sodas just means cafe if you’re wondering.

1jdtjs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jdtjs5/it_does_get_better/,It does get better.,"Last year I was posting on here about wanting to die and how I wanted it all to end. I was 16, hated life, and felt like a burden to everyone. I genuinely felt worthless. I had no reason in particular for feeling so depressed, I just hated everything. 

After feeling that way for months, last april I attempted. It didnt work, obviously. Afterwards I got all the help I needed. I went to therapy and took a break from my life. I became someone completely different and for once I was actually happy. It took time and I didnt just suddenly wake up full of joy, but sometimes you just have to wait things out in life. 

One thing that really helped me get out of such a dark place was picking up new hobbies. I started baking. I wasnt good at the start by any means but I absolutely loved it. On happy days I would bake and on bad days I would bake. It really helped me distract myself and give my life something worth living for. 

Another thing that helped is to just spend time with people. I know thats not easy for a lot of people, but for people who are close with their friends and siblings. Let them know how youre feeling and what they can do to help you. Asking for help when youre feeling low isnt being a burden. Even if its just asking to go for a walk or to go for coffee, it can really change your mood. 

 “We do not remember days, we remember moments” 

All you have to do is focus on having good moments. Forget about the days. Just have good moments and the rest will all work out. 

I know this will probably go over most peoples heads because I doubt anyone will be “inspired” by some 17 year old ranting about loving life on an anonymous app but I hope this reaches the people who need to see it.

My addictive personality never disappeared. 

I smoked weed heavily to quit and played a lot of video games. 8+ hours a day.

Then I cut back on the weed. Then put away the games only to come back to them.

I stopped multi-player games. Then didn't play at all for around a year. Maybe a little less. But then I got elden ring...

I also stopped smoking weed for 5 months during this period.

But then I started drinking more coffee and energy drinks.

Eventually I best elden ring and then felt empty. I wanted to play another single player game but there was nothing out there I wanted to play. Except ff7 rebirth.

But then I smoked weed to play ff7! 

During this 6 month time frame I was also diagnosed with adhd, started medication, and made a hell of a lot of progress in life. 

But my problem is, and has always been, I don't know how to relax. 

It's just not a thing for me. Video games are about the only thing in the world that can make me tune it all out, until they can't and I have to stop again.

I suppose golf and weight lifting can make my brain turn completely off and I actually enjoy it far more than gaming, but it's not feasible to do. 

Physical rest is important... I keep injuring myself because I get addicted to lifting too :(

I don't know if moderation is possible and I know this sub is geared for people who feel that way.

But maybe it's possible to just play a couple of short single player stories every once in a while and treat it like a vacation? 

I genuinely hate most games so it's not like I'd be playing for the sake of playing. 

And I'm NEVER going back to multi-player unless it's with friends. Like physically with them. And being around friends these days in my mid 30s to play video games ain't a thing... 

So. Has anyone had success with my strategy or something similar? ",2,1742260871.0,StopGaming,3,1.0,False

I'm having a difficult time finding an electric kettle that meets all of my requirements. I've done my homework, having read blogs and past posts in this sub. However, I'm left wondering if I'm searching for something that doesn't exist! Can you help?

I have a few requirements:

1) Precise temperature control. People in my household consume a variety of drinks... coffee, herbal tea, green tea, white tea, and more. So we need to be able to use the kettle at different temperatures.

2) No plastic touching the water. It's my understanding that the temperature-checking mechanism has to have either plastic or silicone, and I prefer silicone. I'm fine if there is a plastic handle or base, just not inside and/or touching the water.

3) I'd like a seamless construction of the kettle vessel. For example, the Wolf Gourmet electric kettle. My current electric kettle is stainless steel, but the base and walls of the vessel aren't seamless. I prefer stainless steel or glass.

4) I'm willing to drop this requirement if the first three are met, but I'd also like boil-dry protection and auto-shutoff after a reasonable amount of time.

5) Where I live the water is hard, and I would like if the kettle is easy to clean by hand on the inside.

Some people cannot or do not consume artificial sugars. Some people actually WANT the sugar, because their blood sugar is low! Or perhaps they want the comfort aspect from the comfort food. Presumably that’s why they sell rubbish foods like sausage rolls despite not being healthy. They sell coffee, that I don’t drink, containing an addictive drug which people can pour whole sachets of sugar into if they choose! But I can’t choose to drink a freaking Sprite. 

Maybe it’s just because I’m poor as fuck (so poor that I’m already highly annoyed they got rid of the free parking that I usually use in the Botannicals meaning I now have to pay my bank more fees than i paid in parking for taking money out of my savings to pay the new parking charges) and I already resent having to pay through-the-roof prices for food and drink because I ended up sat here in emergency instead of eating lunch. 

But I absolutely REFUSE to pay those insane prices for food I don’t even like. 

Unfortunately for me that just means I don’t get to drink anything while waiting to find out if my mother has broken any bones after her fall.

Chicken doro wat is served in a richly spiced thick sauce, medium spicy, with boiled egg and feta cheese on the side. This is pretty good too!

Platter comes with traditional Ethiopian ""injera"" -- a soft spongey flatbread which is good for sopping up sauces and flavours. (They have rice available too.)

$36 and generous meal for two. 

They also have individual mains available, around the $24-27 mark.
