There’s Something Wrong with the 6th Floor,"Working the night shift at The Arlington had always suited me. The world was quieter after dark, the guests fewer, and the atmosphere in the grand old hotel felt almost peaceful, at least, it used to. I’ve been here two years now, and if you asked me when things began to feel... off, I’d struggle to pinpoint the exact moment.

The Arlington itself was a relic of another time. Built decades ago, its design was a curious blend of grand old-world charm and modern amenities, a place where marble floors met polished brass railings, and faded chandeliers hung over antique furniture. There was something timeless about the place, like the past and present were always just a little tangled.

I stood behind the front desk, under the soft glow of the overhead lights. It was around 10 PM, and the hotel had settled into its typical night-time lull. A handful of late guests milled about, a businessman hurrying off to catch an elevator, a couple chatting quietly by the fireplace, but nothing out of the ordinary. My job was to keep things running smoothly through the night, a task that had become almost second nature.

I sipped my coffee and stared out at the lobby, my mind wandering. The night shift had a rhythm to it, a kind of predictable monotony that I’d grown accustomed to. Sure, there were always the usual eccentricities of guests, the drunken arguments, the requests for extra towels at 3 AM, the occasional broken room key, but those things didn’t bother me that much, but I usually preferred the quiet. It was during these hours that I could let my mind relax.

That night, as I stood at my post, my thoughts drifted back to the odd conversation I’d had with Sarah earlier. Sarah was the head of housekeeping, a sharp, no-nonsense woman who had been working at the hotel far longer than I had. She had a way of dismissing anything unusual, things that guests would report, strange noises or cold drafts that couldn’t be explained. Her favorite line was, “It’s an old building, Mark. Of course, it has quirks.”

But what happened last week had been different.

“Have you ever noticed anything... strange about the 6th floor?” I had asked her casually one night while she was making her rounds. She had paused, her brow furrowing ever so slightly before quickly shaking her head.

“Not you too,” she’d said with a forced laugh. “Mark, that floor’s been closed for renovations. No one’s staying there. If you’re hearing weird things, it’s probably the pipes.”

The 6th floor. I hadn’t mentioned it in a while, but I’d noticed something odd about it. It wasn’t just that it was closed off, floors closed for renovations weren’t exactly unheard of in a place like this. It was the fact that some nights, it wasn’t just closed, it was gone.

The first time it happened, I barely noticed. I had been going through the usual routine, checking in late arrivals, handing out keycards, and scheduling wake-up calls. When I glanced at the hotel’s system to check for any remaining guests on the 6th floor, it wasn’t listed. It was like it had been erased from the elevator panel and stairwell listings altogether. But the next night, it was back. And the night after that, gone again. The floor seemed to slip in and out of existence, without rhyme or reason.

“Closed for renovations,” Sarah had insisted. “Don’t worry about it.” But the renovations weren’t mentioned anywhere in our official schedule, and no one had spoken to me about moving guests or relocating them.

A sudden knock at the front desk pulled me from my thoughts. I blinked, glancing up to see Ben, the day shift manager, standing in front of me with his usual gruff expression. Ben wasn’t one for small talk, and though we got along fine, I always felt like he viewed the night shift as something beneath him.

“Hey,” Ben said, eyeing the cup of coffee in my hand. “Everything running smoothly?”

“Same as always,” I replied, forcing a smile. “Nothing out of the ordinary.”

Ben grunted in acknowledgment. He leaned on the desk and cast a glance around the quiet lobby, before turning his gaze back to me. “Look, I’ve been hearing some things from the staff about you asking questions, about the 6th floor.” He said it matter-of-factly, but I could sense a warning in his tone.

I hesitated. “I was just curious. I mean, one night it’s listed in the system, the next it’s not. I thought maybe there was a maintenance issue or something.”

“Don’t overthink it, Mark,” Ben said, his voice firm. “The 6th floor is off-limits for a reason. If you’re getting calls from there or noticing any strange listings, it’s just a glitch. This hotel’s old. Sometimes things don’t work the way they should.”

I nodded, though I wasn’t entirely convinced. Ben didn’t give me a chance to respond before straightening up and walking away. “Just stick to your duties,” he called over his shoulder as he disappeared through the staff-only door.

I couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that there was more going on than Ben or Sarah wanted to admit. This wasn’t just old pipes or outdated systems acting up. Something else was happening here.

It wasn’t until around 2 AM, when the lobby had emptied out completely, that the unease started to creep in again. I sat at the desk, staring at the computer screen, debating whether I should check the system one more time.

Curiosity got the better of me.

I clicked through the hotel listings, scrolling down to the floor directory.

The 6th floor was gone again.

Not marked as closed. Not offline. Gone. As if it had never existed. I stared at the screen for a long moment.

A shiver ran down my spine. I checked the elevator panel from my desk, and sure enough, the button for the 6th floor was gone too, replaced by a blank spot between 5 and 7. I leaned back in my chair, rubbing the back of my neck.

I stood, grabbed my keycard, and headed toward the elevator.

As I stepped into the elevator, my heart raced with a mixture of curiosity and fear. The soft hum of the elevator always had a comforting regularity to it, but tonight, it felt different. The usual calmness of my routine was replaced by an uneasy anticipation. The 6th floor had vanished before, and tonight, I needed to see if it would return.

The elevator panel blinked softly as I scanned the floor numbers. Sure enough, between the buttons for 5 and 7, there was only an empty space. No button for the 6th floor.

I pushed the button for the 5th floor instead, thinking I could check the stairwell from there. The elevator began its smooth ascent, and I watched the numbers light up, counting the floors one by one. The ride was unnervingly slow, each floor ticked by as if the elevator were hesitating. When the doors finally slid open with a soft chime, I stepped out into the 5th-floor hallway.

The air was cooler here, and the dim lights overhead flickered slightly. I turned toward the stairwell. I pushed open the door to the stairwell.

The stairwell was narrow and shadowy, lit only by emergency lights casting weak pools of yellow onto the steps. I made my way up the stairs, feeling the solid thud of each footstep as I climbed. When I reached the landing between the 5th and 6th floors, I hesitated. There was a sudden drop in temperature, so sharp that I could see my breath in the cold air.

The sign that should have read 6th Floor was blank.

I stared at it, my pulse quickening. It was as if the 6th floor had been erased from existence. I pushed open the stairwell door to the hallway, stepping into what should have been the 6th floor.

The lights in the hallway flickered. I stood still for a moment, letting my eyes adjust to the dim light. The hallway stretched out in front of me, eerily quiet. My footfalls were swallowed by the thick carpet, and I was unnerved by the complete absence of sound. No distant chatter from other guests, no hum of the air conditioning, just silence.

Then, from somewhere down the hall, I heard it.

A soft, almost imperceptible giggle. The sound of children laughing.

I instinctively glanced over my shoulder, but the hallway behind me was empty. I couldn’t explain the laughter, but the sound sent a cold chill through my body. I knew the floor was supposed to be empty, yet the faint sound of laughter drifted through the air, growing fainter as it moved further down the corridor.

I swallowed hard and took a few steps forward, drawn by the strange, unsettling sound. Room doors were slightly ajar as I passed them, revealing dark interiors that I couldn’t quite make out. The floor seemed... abandoned. Yet, it also felt occupied, as if the presence of something unseen lurked just out of sight.

I stopped in front of room 616. The door was cracked open, and a faint glow from within the room spilled into the hallway. My pulse quickened. This was the same room I’d received a call from earlier, despite the hotel system claiming the 6th floor was closed. I pushed the door open slowly, the hinges creaking ominously.

Inside, the room was in disarray. The bed was unmade, the lamps on the bedside tables were knocked over, and the curtains were half-drawn. It looked as though someone had left in a hurry, but there were no signs of struggle, just an eerie stillness. A strange, musty smell hung in the air, and as I stepped further into the room, my eyes landed on the bathroom mirror.

Written in red, smeared across the glass, were the words: “Get out while you can.”

I froze. The writing looked fresh, the red letters dripping slightly down the surface of the mirror. I reached out, my fingers trembling as I touched the glass. The substance was sticky and real.

A sharp noise behind me made me spin around, my heart pounding in my chest. The door had slammed shut, and the room was plunged into near darkness. Panic set in as I rushed to the door, yanking it open with trembling hands.

I stepped into the hallway, gasping for breath. The oppressive silence returned. I glanced back at room 616. The sense of being watched clung to me like a heavy cloak, and I could feel my skin prickling with the weight of unseen eyes.

I needed to leave.

Back at the front desk, I sat down heavily. I glanced at the security monitor, but nothing seemed out of place. The 6th floor, now missing from the directory, looked completely still on the cameras. I rubbed my temples, trying to process what had just happened. The laughter, the writing on the mirror, the door slamming shut on its own, it didn’t make sense.

I pulled up the hotel’s guest records, scrolling through the room assignments. As I feared, room 616 had been marked as unoccupied for days. No one was listed as staying there tonight, or any night, for that matter. The system showed it as closed, just like the rest of the 6th floor.

I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the screen. Something was very wrong here, and I was the only one who seemed to notice. Ben and Sarah could dismiss it as glitches or quirks of an old building, but I knew better.

The following nights at The Arlington were a blur of unease and growing paranoia. My mind kept drifting back to the 6th floor, to that room with the writing on the mirror. I tried to convince myself that I had imagined it, that maybe it was some twisted prank left by a guest before the floor was closed. But I couldn’t shake the sense that something was wrong, something deeper than what Ben or Sarah could explain away.

Every time I glanced at the hotel system during my shift, my eyes would automatically scroll down to the list of floors, half-expecting the 6th floor to appear again. Some nights it did. Others, it was gone, completely erased from the directory, as though it never existed. The inconsistency gnawed at me, and I started to notice something else. Every time the 6th floor returned, strange things happened in the hotel.

Guests began complaining more frequently, though not in the way you’d expect. It wasn’t about the usual things like the temperature of the room or the water pressure. No, it was much more unsettling than that.

One night, a middle-aged woman approached the front desk, her eyes wide with fear. I recognized her as someone who had checked in earlier that day, assigned to a room on the 5th floor.

“Is everything alright, ma’am?” I asked, though the answer was already written on her pale face.

She shook her head, glancing nervously over her shoulder as if expecting someone to appear behind her. “I need to change rooms. There’s… something wrong with mine.”

I raised an eyebrow, trying to maintain a calm demeanor. “Can you tell me what’s wrong? I’ll send someone to fix it right away.”

“No, it’s not that,” she said quickly, her voice hushed. “It’s not the room itself. It’s… the walls. I hear things, people moving inside the walls. And there was someone standing at the foot of my bed when I woke up. But when I turned on the light, they were gone.”

A chill ran down my spine, but I kept my expression neutral. “Did you see who it was?”

Her eyes darted around the lobby, as if she couldn’t bring herself to look directly at me. “No. It was just a shadow… but it felt like someone was there. Watching me.”

I pulled up the system on the computer, trying to distract myself from the knot of fear building in my stomach. “I’ll move you to a different room,” I said, my fingers trembling slightly as I clicked through the options. “Would you prefer a room on a different floor?”

“Yes,” she said firmly. “As far from the 6th floor as possible.”

I froze, my hand hovering over the keyboard. “The 6th floor?” I asked cautiously. “You’re on the 5th floor. Why do you mention the 6th?”

She blinked, seeming confused. “I don’t know. It’s just… it feels like something’s wrong with that floor. I can hear things coming from above me. It doesn’t feel right.”

I nodded. I gave her a new room key for a room on the 3rd floor and watched as she hurried away, glancing over her shoulder one last time before disappearing into the hallway. I stood there for a moment, gripping the edge of the desk. I wasn’t imagining things. There was something about the 6th floor, something that reached beyond the confines of its walls and affected the other floors. I could feel it in the way the air grew colder when the floor returned, the way the guests seemed unsettled without even knowing why.

The next night, another guest approached the desk. A businessman this time, staying on the 7th floor. His suit was wrinkled, and there were dark circles under his eyes, as though he hadn’t slept in days.

“I need to check out,” he said bluntly, tossing his room key onto the desk. “There’s something wrong with this place.”

I stared at him, trying to keep my voice steady. “What happened, sir?”

“I lost hours,” he said, his voice flat, almost mechanical. “I went to bed around midnight. I woke up at 2 AM, a few moments later, when I checked my phone again, it was 8 AM. I don’t remember anything from those hours. It’s like they were erased.”

I frowned, I tried to hide my confusion as I spoke. “I’m sorry for the inconvenience. I can-”

“I’m leaving,” he interrupted, his voice tight with barely controlled fear. “I don’t want to stay another night. There’s something wrong with this place.”

That night, after the last guest had left the lobby, I sat behind the front desk, staring at the empty computer screen. The complaints were piling up, people hearing strange noises, losing track of time, feeling watched in their own rooms. And all of them seemed to be tied to the nights when the 6th floor reappeared.

It didn’t make sense. How could a floor come and go like that?

I needed answers.

The next night, I couldn’t resist the pull of the 6th floor any longer. After the guests had gone to bed and the hotel was quiet, I found myself once again standing in front of the elevator. The button for the 6th floor had returned, glowing faintly as though inviting me back.

This time, I didn’t hesitate. I pressed the button, and the elevator doors slid shut, the familiar hum filling the air. As I ascended, my stomach twisted with dread. I didn’t know what I expected to find, but I couldn’t ignore the growing sense of urgency building inside me.

The elevator stopped, and the doors opened with a soft chime. The hallway was just as I remembered, dark, cold, and suffocatingly quiet.

I took a deep breath and stepped into the hallway. I walked slowly, passing the darkened rooms, their doors slightly ajar as though they were waiting for someone to enter.

And then I saw it.

Another message, scrawled in red across the mirror in one of the rooms.

""You’re next.""

Who could have written it? Was it a guest playing some kind of sick prank, or was it something more sinister? The thought gnawed at me, making it hard to think clearly. I felt like I had stumbled onto something that wasn’t meant for me to see, something dangerous.

I had to get out of there.

I turned and hurried down the hallway, the oppressive silence pressing in on me from all sides.

As I reached the end of the hallway, something caught my eye.

There, just ahead, was a group of hotel staff, three or four of them, standing at the far end of the corridor. For a moment, I felt a wave of relief. Maybe I wasn’t alone after all.

But as I took a few steps closer, I realized something was terribly wrong.

They were dressed in uniforms that were clearly from another era, bellhops in red jackets with brass buttons, maids in old-fashioned black-and-white attire, and a front desk clerk in a stiff, high-collared suit. They stood perfectly still, their backs to me, as if they were waiting for something.

I opened my mouth to call out, but the words died in my throat.

Their movements were strange, unnatural. The way they shifted their weight from one foot to the other, the slight tilts of their heads, it was stiff and robotic A chill ran down my spine.

Something wasn’t right. These weren’t regular staff members.

I watched in growing horror as one by one, they began to turn around, their movements jerky and mechanical. I took a step back. When they finally faced me, my blood ran cold.

Their faces were blank.

No eyes. No mouths. Just smooth, featureless skin where their faces should have been. They stood there, expressionless, if you could even call it that, staring at me with those empty, non-existent faces. The air around me grew colder, and the oppressive weight of the floor seemed to press down on my chest, making it hard to breathe.

I stumbled backward, my mind racing. I needed to get away from them, but my feet felt heavy, like I was wading through thick, invisible mud. The staff didn’t move, but I could feel their presence pulling at me, drawing me in like the 6th floor had been doing for days.

“Hello?” I croaked, my voice shaking.

No response. The blank-faced staff stood perfectly still, their heads slightly tilted, as if waiting for something. Then, without warning, they turned in unison and began to walk toward one of the rooms, room 616. The door swung open as they approached, and they filed inside, disappearing into the darkness.

Something inside me, a morbid curiosity or maybe a deep-seated fear, compelled me to follow them.

I stepped toward room 616, my legs trembling. When I reached the doorway, I hesitated. The room beyond was dark. I could hear a faint whispering sound coming from within, but I couldn’t make out the words.

Slowly, I pushed the door open.

Inside, the room was empty.

No staff. No furniture. Just an empty, silent room.

But there, lying on the bed, was a single note.

My hands shook as I picked it up. The paper was old, yellowed with age, and the handwriting was smudged and uneven. I held it up to the dim light coming through the window and read the words:

""We’re still working.""

I backed out of the room, I had seen enough. I didn’t care what Sarah or Ben said anymore. Something was horribly wrong with this hotel, and it centered around the 6th floor. The staff I had seen weren’t real, or at least, not anymore. They were like echoes of the past.

I needed to leave.

I bolted for the elevator, my footsteps echoing through the empty hallway. But when I reached the doors and pressed the button, nothing happened. The elevator stayed on another floor, unmoving. The button for the 6th floor was no longer illuminated.

A sense of panic began to rise in my chest as I turned toward the stairwell. I pushed open the door, expecting to find my way down to the lobby, but what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

The stairwell was gone.

In its place was another hallway, just like the one I had just come from. The same flickering lights, the same thick carpet, the same oppressive silence. My pulse quickened, and I backed away, turning to look behind me. But the hallway I had just come from had changed too. It stretched endlessly in both directions, as if I had been transported to some other part of the hotel that shouldn’t exist.

I was trapped.

I tried to stay calm, tried to reason with myself. This was just a trick of the mind, a hallucination brought on by stress and fatigue.

I started walking, hoping that if I kept moving, I would find a way out. But no matter how far I walked, the hallway stretched on endlessly. The exit signs at the far end of the corridor flickered in and out of sight, always just out of reach. It was as if the building itself was toying with me, keeping me trapped in this nightmarish loop.

Finally, after what felt like hours of walking, I saw it, a door marked STAFF ONLY.

I didn’t hesitate. I rushed toward it, and twisted the handle.

The door swung open, and I stumbled through it, expecting to find myself back in the stairwell or the lobby.

But instead, I found myself standing in front of the front desk.

I blinked, disoriented.

Had I imagined it all? The phantom staff, the endless hallways, the message on the mirror. It all seemed so distant now, like a half-remembered dream.

But as I glanced at the security monitors, I saw something.

The cameras for the 6th floor flickered briefly, and for a split second, I saw them, the staff, standing perfectly still in the hallway, their blank faces turned toward the camera, as if they were watching me.

I backed away from the monitor, my hands trembling.

This wasn’t over.

I couldn’t sleep after that night. Even when my shift was over, I couldn’t shake the images from my mind: the blank faces of the phantom staff, the endless hallway, the ominous message scrawled on the mirror. I found myself avoiding the mirrors in my own apartment, too. Whenever I glanced at one, I would catch a flicker of something, shadows that shouldn’t be there, movements that didn’t belong to me. It was as if the 6th floor was creeping into my life, even when I wasn’t at the hotel.

The nightmares didn’t help either. Every night, I dreamt of being trapped in the hotel, lost in that labyrinthine hallway that never seemed to end. In my dreams, I was always running from something I couldn’t see but could feel lurking just behind me, waiting for me to slow down, waiting to catch me. Each time, I would wake up in a cold sweat, the sense of dread lingering long after the dream faded.

A few nights later, I was back at the front desk. The hotel was quiet as usual, the guests long since retired to their rooms. I had been watching the security monitors closely, especially the ones for the 6th floor. Tonight, the floor was listed in the system again, but the cameras showed nothing out of the ordinary, just an empty hallway, the lights flickering occasionally.

Around 2 AM, the phone rang.

I stared at it for a moment, my stomach twisting with dread. Every time the phone rang now, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of foreboding, as if each call was pulling me deeper into whatever dark force was haunting the 6th floor.

I picked up the receiver, trying to keep my voice steady. “Front desk, this is Mark.”

There was a pause, followed by a low, crackling static. Then, through the static, I heard a voice, distorted, faint, but unmistakably human.

“...Room 621...”

“Hello?” I said into the phone, my voice betraying the growing unease in my chest. “Can you repeat that?”

There was no response. Just static.

I hung up the phone, my mind racing. Was someone playing a sick joke on me? I knew I couldn’t just ignore it. I grabbed my keycard and headed toward the elevator, my hands trembling slightly as I pressed the button for the 6th floor.

When the doors slid open, I stepped out into the now-familiar hallway.

I walked down the hall, counting the numbers on the doors as I went. 619, 620, 621. I stopped in front of the door.

I swiped my keycard, the lock clicking softly as the door swung open.

The room was dark. I reached for the light switch, but nothing happened. The bulb must have burned out. I stepped inside, the door closing softly behind me. The room felt colder than the rest of the hotel.

As I moved further into the room, I noticed something strange. There were no mirrors. Not on the walls, not in the bathroom, nothing. Every reflective surface had been removed.

A sense of dread washed over me as I realized how unusual that was. I had worked at this hotel for two years, and every room had a standard set of mirrors: one above the sink in the bathroom, a full-length mirror by the closet, and sometimes even smaller ones on the dresser. But here, there was nothing.

I swallowed hard, backing toward the door, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of movement. That’s when I saw it, reflected in the glossy black surface of the television screen.

A shadow.

It stood behind me, tall and dark, its form barely distinguishable from the surrounding gloom. My heart pounded in my chest as I stared at the screen, unable to tear my gaze away. The figure didn’t move, didn’t make a sound, but I could feel its presence. It was watching me.

I spun around, but the room was empty. Nothing.

I backed toward the door, my hands shaking as I fumbled for the handle. I needed to get out of there.

I yanked on the handle, but it was as if the door had vanished into the wall. There was no escape. I was trapped.

Panic set in as I turned toward the window, hoping to find some other way out, but the windows were sealed shut. I couldn’t even see the city lights beyond, just an endless expanse of darkness pressing against the glass.

I tried my phone, but the screen was black, unresponsive. My radio, too, emitted nothing but static. I was completely cut off.

The air in the room grew colder, and I could feel the presence of something unseen watching me. It was as if the walls themselves were alive, closing in on me, suffocating me. I stumbled back to the center of the room, my mind racing with fear and confusion.

Then, without warning, I heard it, a soft knock, coming from inside the room.

The knock came again, as if someone was trying to get my attention.

I turned slowly, my eyes scanning the room, but there was no one there. Just shadows.

The knock came again, but this time it was right behind me.

I spun around, my heart pounding in my chest, but once again, the room was empty. The walls seemed to pulse with a life of their own, the shadows shifting and writhing in the dim light.

And then, the room fell silent, the oppressive weight of the air pressing down on me like a vice.

I didn’t know how long I stood there, frozen in place. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the door.

It had reappeared.

I didn’t waste any time. I rushed toward it, yanking it open. I stumbled out into the hallway, gasping for breath, my heart still racing from the terror of what I had just experienced.

Something was wrong with this place, and I had a sinking feeling that I was getting closer to the truth. A truth I wasn’t sure I wanted to uncover.

I hurried down the hallway, refusing to glance over my shoulder, convinced that the shadows were moving, twisting, watching me.

When I reached the elevator, I pressed the button frantically. The lights above flickered, and for a moment, I thought it wouldn’t come. The soft hum of the machinery finally filled the silence, and the doors opened with a smooth chime. I stepped inside, my heart racing, and pressed the button for the lobby.

Back at the front desk, I sat down heavily, my hands shaking. My mind was racing, replaying everything that had happened over the past few weeks.

It didn’t feel real. But I knew it was.

I needed answers.

I logged into the hotel’s old archive system, an outdated collection of files, reports, and blueprints that no one had bothered with in years. The information I was looking for had to be buried here somewhere.

It took me nearly an hour of scrolling through irrelevant documents before I found something: an old incident report from the early 1970s, simply titled “Closure of the 6th Floor.” I opened the file. The report was brief, the details vague, but it told me enough.

According to the document, the 6th floor had been permanently closed after a series of unexplained deaths. Guests who checked in on that floor were found dead under mysterious circumstances, heart attacks, or cases where there was no apparent cause of death at all. One chilling account described a guest who was found standing in the middle of their room, eyes wide open, completely frozen. The floor was supposed to have been sealed off decades ago, but something had gone horribly wrong.

The hotel management at the time had quietly shut it down, hiding the deaths from the public. But the 6th floor hadn’t stayed closed. Every few decades, it reappeared, drawing in new guests.

My heart pounded at the realisation that this was happening again, and it was happening for weeks now.

The phone buzzed, jolting me out of my thoughts. It was Sarah, the head of housekeeping.

“Mark, where are you?” she asked, her voice sounding distant, almost distorted. “I’m on the 5th floor. I thought I saw someone wandering around, but when I got there, the floor was empty.”

I hesitated, unsure if I should tell her about everything I had discovered. But she had always brushed off my concerns, always telling me that it was just an old building acting up. Would she even believe me?

“I... I’m at the desk. Stay away from the 6th floor, Sarah. There’s something wrong with it. I’ve been getting calls, and… there’s more to it than you think.”

There was silence on the other end, but I could hear her breathing, quick and shallow.

“I’ve been hearing things too,” she said after a long pause. “Voices, footsteps. I thought it was just in my head, but... you’re telling me it’s real?”

“More real than I want to admit,” I replied. “You need to get out of here, Sarah. Whatever’s happening on that floor, it’s not safe.”

Sarah didn’t respond. There was a soft click, and the line went dead.

The rest of my shift passed in a blur of anxious pacing and stolen glances at the security monitors. Every time the camera feed flickered, I felt my stomach lurch, half-expecting to see those blank-faced staff members again, waiting for me.

It wasn’t until just before dawn, as I was preparing to hand over the shift to the day staff, that something strange happened. The elevator doors opened with a soft chime, and I watched as a group of guests stepped out, chatting softly amongst themselves.

They were all wearing clothes from another era. Suits from the 1970s, dresses with high collars and lace. And their faces, pale, expressionless. Their eyes didn’t meet mine as they crossed the lobby and exited the hotel, disappearing into the early morning light.

I stood frozen behind the desk, my mind struggling to process what I had just seen. It was as if the hotel’s past was bleeding into the present, the ghosts of those trapped on the 6th floor spilling out into the world beyond.

I couldn’t stay at The Arlington after that. I handed in my resignation that morning, packed up my things, and left the hotel. But even now, weeks later, the memories of the 6th floor still haunt me.

I still see the figures in my dreams, blank-faced staff members, shadowy figures standing at the foot of my bed. I still hear the soft, distant knock coming from inside the walls. And every now and then, when I glance into a mirror, I see something else looking back at me, something that doesn’t belong.

I try to tell myself it’s all in my head, but I know the truth.

The 6th floor is still there.",1,1766218043.0,CreepyStoriesArchive,0,1.0,False

This last year has been rough for alot of people and I completely acknowledge that I have a lot to be grateful for. 

I’ve been working in my industry for a little over a decade. I’m 33 F and I work in somewhat of a male dominated industry. Anyway, I started at my current job in 2023 thanks to a referral by a friend. In less than a year I was promoted three times and am now a Senior Account Executive. I love what I do and I’ve made so many connections and friends in the industry. Unfortunately I find that some connections that I thought would last burned bright and fizzled out quickly. People have come and gone from the company in the time that I’ve been there and i feel like I’m kind of tossed aside once their tenure is over. I guess I thought that I was building real genuine relationships and it just sucks to feel like the bond wasn’t strong enough to last with the changing tides. 

There have been SEVERAL people that I’ve connected with in the last year that I pretty much no longer here from for one reason or the other. All of them have left the company either at their on will or have been fired. There is one situation in particular that really stung. This year I supervised a small team of three. We worked so well together and we really got close. I prided myself on being a good leader and example for them. They had no problem coming to me with any issues they were having, they respected my authority and we really built a bond. I let them get hands on experience by going out into the field, networking, traveling, and being pretty relaxed overall as long as they got their work done. One of the ladies that I felt had become a really good friend was dropping the ball on her responsibilities and had a major falling out with a client. After several other missteps on her end and several warnings, I had to make the very difficult decision to terminate her contract. I was heartbroken and so was she. I was even more heartbroken to hear that she had been telling some of the current employees that she somehow blamed me for how things played out. I reached out to her a few times after and offered to help in her search to find something that may be a better fit but she didn’t seem interested in my help. I saw her recently at an event and she did get a new role. She didn’t speak to me and avoided eye contact. 

My most recent promotion allowed me the opportunity to move away from a position of management and into a role that was more independent. The girls that were on my team have also been moved to other teams. I gave up my office, as I am now hybrid (two days in office three days out) and have been focused on my new responsibilities. Since I am no longer in the office I noticed that the communication pretty much has stopped. The other teams have really fostered a closeness with eachother and I just don’t feel like I’m a part of that anymore. I don’t know if I truly feel left out but I guess just….isolated. I understand that they acknowledge that I’m in a different position of authority now but I guess I atleast thought that they would still see me as personable and a part of the team. I try to be as approachable as possible. Still offering snack, coffee runs, and inviting them to attend industry events with me but no one bites. I sometimes pop into their side of the building to say hello and the vibe is so different. I’ve been told by several of them that I am missed and it just isn’t the same without me there but it doesn’t seem like it honestly. 

Some of my close friends outside of work have also drifted. I feel guilty talking about work or my accomplishments because they didn’t seem to want to hear it. I really don’t take up alot of space. I’m the friend who listens the majority of the time, and allow others to take up as much space and talk about themselves as much as they want. I started to feel foolish when I would mention a trip I was taking for work or something that I was really proud of and would be met with silence. I’ve had to make the really tough choice to kind of back away from some relationships because they no longer felt balanced.

At this point I’m ranting. Again- I’m not complaining. I love what I do and I wouldn’t change it for the world but I guess I expected my social circle to grow as I expanded…not shrink. ",2,1766217978.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Then reality began to fall apart,"The rain had been falling all day, an unbroken sheet of grey draping over the city. I watched the droplets race down my apartment window, merging together and disappearing, much like my thoughts these days. Writing had once been a way to escape from the chaos of life, but now, it felt like I was trying to dig my way out of quicksand, every word pulled me deeper into exhaustion and self-doubt.

I was a freelance writer, though I hadn’t been writing much lately. My income, always precarious, had become even more unstable. Each assignment seemed like a Herculean task, the simplest projects dragging on for days, sometimes weeks, as I wrestled with my dwindling creativity. There was a time when words flowed effortlessly, when stories spilled onto the page with a natural rhythm, but those days felt like they belonged to someone else. I couldn’t even remember the last time I’d written something that truly excited me.

The isolation wasn’t helping. My small apartment, cluttered with stacks of books, old notes, and unfinished manuscripts, felt less like a sanctuary and more like a tomb. It was always too quiet. Occasionally, the muffled sounds of traffic or distant conversations would seep in through the thin walls, but they did little to break the heavy silence. 

Most days, I wouldn’t speak a word out loud until the late afternoon, when I’d finally force myself to venture out for groceries or a cup of coffee, just to see some other human faces. Even then, my interactions were fleeting and empty, quick exchanges with baristas or cashiers who probably wouldn’t recognize me if I came in the next day.

My friends, the ones I had shared laughs and secrets with in college, had all moved on to busy lives filled with families, careers, and social circles that I no longer fit into. The group chats that once buzzed with messages were now quiet, just like everything else. I would scroll through them sometimes, reading old conversations and wondering how the thread had become so frayed.

I had tried reaching out, making small attempts to reconnect, but our conversations always felt forced, as if we were actors playing parts in a show that had long since been canceled. Eventually, I stopped trying. The solitude grew thicker, and I began to fear it was becoming a part of me, wrapping itself around my bones like a second skin.

It was on one of those bleak, rainy days that I decided I couldn’t stay cooped up inside any longer. I grabbed my coat and left my apartment, not knowing where I was headed, just that I needed to escape, if only for a little while. The rain was cold as it hit my face, a sharp contrast to the stifling warmth of the apartment. I wandered aimlessly through the city, past familiar cafes and storefronts, not feeling any particular draw to any of them.

My feet carried me down streets I rarely ventured, through neighborhoods that grew older and more weathered the deeper I went. Eventually, I found myself standing in a narrow, dimly lit alleyway I didn’t recognize. It was tucked between two towering brick buildings, their facades stained dark with age and rain. I hesitated, wondering if I had taken a wrong turn somewhere, but then I saw it: an old wooden sign swaying slightly in the damp breeze.

""Lost Pages,"" it read, the letters barely visible under the layers of dust and grime. The bookstore’s narrow windows were cluttered with faded paperbacks and old-fashioned leather-bound volumes, their covers dulled by time. The glass panes were fogged with moisture, and the light within was dim and flickering.

Curiosity piqued, I pushed open the door, and the old-fashioned bell above the frame jangled faintly. The air inside was heavy, filled with the scent of aged paper and wood polish. It was darker than I expected, with most of the light filtering in from the narrow front windows. The store was cluttered, chaotic even, with stacks of books piled high on tables and chairs, shelves sagging under the weight of countless volumes. Narrow aisles twisted and turned, leading deeper into the shadows.

I wandered through the narrow aisles, running my fingers over the books that seemed to belong to another era. Some were printed in faded typefaces, their covers cracked and peeling, while others looked like handmade journals, stitched together by someone’s careful hands, long ago. The deeper I ventured, the quieter the world seemed to grow, the hum of the city fading into the background as if I had stepped into another time altogether.

It was then that I saw it. The book lay on a small table tucked away in the back, almost hidden under a pile of yellowing maps. It was a small, nondescript leather-bound book, no larger than a pocket diary, and the cover was worn, its once-rich brown faded to a dull, murky shade. There were no words on the spine, no title or author’s name to give any hint as to what it contained.

I picked it up, feeling an odd chill travel through my fingers as they brushed against the leather. It felt cold to the touch, much colder than any book should be. I opened it, expecting to see faded text or blank pages, but the pages weren’t entirely blank. There were faint marks, almost like shadows of words, that seemed to shimmer and shift as I tilted the book under the dim light. It was as though the text was hiding, revealing itself only from certain angles.

The sound of a floorboard creaking made me jump. I hadn’t noticed the elderly man standing behind the counter, watching me with a faint, unreadable expression. He seemed to blend into the shadows, his clothes faded and old, just like everything else in the shop.

“Find something interesting?” he asked, his voice rough and gravelly.

I held up the book. “What’s this?” I asked, more to break the silence than out of any real expectation for an answer.

The old man’s eyes glinted in the low light. “The book finds those who need it,” he said, as if reciting a well-practiced line. There was a hint of a smile on his lips. “Or perhaps… those it needs.”

I didn’t know what to say to that, but something about the book held my attention. I felt an urge to take it with me.

I glanced back at the man. “How much?” I asked.

His smile widened ever so slightly. “For you? Five dollars.”

It seemed too cheap for such an old book, but I reached into my wallet, handed him the money, and tucked the book under my arm. As I turned to leave, the old man called after me. “Be careful what you find,” he said, his voice low and almost drowned out by the sound of the door creaking open. I glanced back, but he had already turned away, vanishing into the store’s shadowed depths.

Back in the quiet of my apartment, the book sat on my coffee table like a dark presence, a strange weight in the room. I couldn’t seem to ignore it; it was as though it was waiting for me to open it, to uncover whatever secrets lay hidden within its pages. I finally sat down, picked it up, and cracked it open once more.

Words filled the first page in a delicate, slanted script that looked handwritten, as if someone had carefully penned each letter. The words described a memory I had buried long ago, one that sent a shiver down my spine.

It was from when I was a child, maybe eight or nine years old. My parents had taken me to a fair one summer night, filled with bright lights and music. I had wandered off, distracted by a booth selling trinkets, and before I knew it, my parents were nowhere to be found. I remember the panic that had seized me, the suffocating feeling of being lost in a sea of strangers. Hours seemed to pass before a security guard found me crying and reunited me with my frantic parents.

How could this be? I had never told anyone about that experience, not in such vivid detail. Yet, here it was, written out in the book as if someone had been there with me, seeing and feeling everything I had in that moment of fear.

The next morning, the unsettling memory from the book lingered in my mind, refusing to be dismissed. I tried to rationalize it, maybe I had read a similar story somewhere before, or maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. It wasn’t impossible; I had been under a lot of stress lately. I had to shake off the feeling and get out of the apartment. A walk would do me good.

I put on my coat and left the apartment, letting the crisp autumn air fill my lungs. I walked aimlessly, allowing the city to swallow me up. The sound of traffic, the chatter of people, the hum of the city, it was all strangely soothing. My feet carried me through familiar streets, until I ended up in a quieter part of town. I had walked here many times before; I knew these streets well, or so I thought.

I had barely taken a few steps down a narrow side street when I felt a strange sensation wash over me, a tingling chill that prickled the back of my neck. The street looked the same, yet… different. There was something off about it, something I couldn’t quite place. I glanced around, suddenly aware that the street signs didn’t match the names I remembered.

Panic began to creep in, and I reached for my phone to check the GPS. But when I pulled up the map, my location was a blank, grey void. I closed the app and reopened it, thinking it was just a glitch, but the result was the same, no roads, no landmarks, no street names, just an empty screen. A wave of dizziness swept over me, and I felt as if the world had shifted somehow, as though I had walked into a different version of the city.

I continued walking. I passed buildings I didn’t recognize, shops that hadn’t been there the last time I visited this part of town. The more I walked, the more disoriented I became, and soon, I couldn’t tell which way I had come from.

It wasn’t long before a thick fog began to roll in, wrapping itself around the streets like a blanket. It came in fast, swallowing up the pavement and rising up to knee level. The fog was dense, more like smoke than mist. I could barely see a few feet ahead of me. My heart pounded in my chest as the world seemed to fade away, consumed by the murk.

My legs trembled, and I stumbled forward, driven by a need to escape the suffocating fog. I turned down another street, then another. I began to run, until I finally saw a break in the fog, a familiar intersection up ahead.

I staggered out of the haze, collapsing onto a bench at the side of the road. The fog was still there, hanging over the street like a curtain, but it didn’t seem to reach me anymore. I could see the familiar shops and cafes now, the traffic flowing smoothly, as if nothing unusual had happened. I sat there for a long time, catching my breath, trying to calm the frantic beating of my heart. Had I imagined it? It all seemed impossible, like a nightmare I couldn’t wake from.

But when I checked the time, nearly two hours had passed. Two hours of wandering in a place that shouldn’t have existed. I couldn’t explain it, and a part of me didn’t want to. I just wanted to go home and forget about it.

After the disorienting events of the day, I couldn’t bring myself to sleep. I sat at my desk, the dim glow of the lamp casting a soft halo of light over the pages of the book. I had to know what it would reveal next, no matter how unnerving. My hands shook as I opened the leather cover, bracing myself for whatever story might appear.

Slowly, the faint traces of words began to surface on the page, growing clearer with each passing moment. The text described a claustrophobic feeling, a fear of being trapped in a small space, and of the walls closing in. It talked about the sensation of suffocating, the inability to breathe, and the irrational certainty that the space itself was shrinking. The fear was so vividly described that I could almost feel the walls pressing in around me.

I closed the book abruptly, my pulse quickening. I stood up and began pacing the room, trying to shake off the creeping sensation of unease.

But then I noticed something strange. As I passed by the wall near my bed, I thought I saw it move, just a subtle, almost imperceptible shift, like a breath. I turned quickly, staring at the spot, but it was still, silent. It had to be my imagination. I was letting the book get to me, feeding into my own anxieties.

I tried to calm myself down, telling myself that it was all in my head. But when I stepped closer, I felt a soft vibration, almost like a heartbeat. I reached out and placed my hand against the wall. It was warm. Too warm. And there was a subtle give to the surface, like it wasn’t quite solid.

I jerked my hand back, my breath coming in short gasps. I backed away, my eyes fixed on the wall. It pulsed again, and this time, I was sure of it. It was moving, expanding outward ever so slightly, then contracting again. The room seemed to grow smaller, the air thicker, as though the walls were pressing in from all sides.

Desperation clawed at my mind. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and approached the wall, gripping the handle with trembling fingers. If there was something wrong with the wall, I needed to see it for myself. I pressed the blade against the surface and dragged it downward, tearing through the wallpaper.

Beneath the surface, a dark substance oozed out... a thick, viscous fluid that glistened under the dim light. The wall itself seemed to throb, like an open wound, and I could see a network of veins coursing just below the surface, pulsating with a dark fluid that seemed to breathe along with the room. I stumbled back, horrified by the sight, as the walls seemed to bulge inward, suffocating me with their closeness.

The room grew warmer, the air stagnant and heavy. I could barely think, barely breathe. I backed toward the door, desperate to escape.

I flung the door open and fled out into the hallway, gasping for air. The corridor outside was cool, blessedly still, and I collapsed against the opposite wall, my breath uneven. I didn’t know how long I sat there, trembling, my mind racing to make sense of what I had just seen. When I finally summoned the courage to look back into the apartment, the walls appeared normal, solid, undisturbed. The tear in the wallpaper was gone.

I eventually went to sleep, although I barely slept that night.

The morning light filtered through the curtains. The book sat closed on the desk, its leather cover cracked and worn. I had almost convinced myself not to open it again, but my mind kept returning to the feeling of the wall under my fingers, pulsing with a life of its own. I needed answers, and I was sure they wouldn't come from the pages of that cursed book.

I made my way out of the apartment and headed back to where all this had started: the old bookstore, Lost Pages. I walked through the crowded streets, the noise of the city buzzing in the background, but it all felt distant. As I approached the narrow alleyway, a sense of dread gnawed at me. I had to find the bookstore, but when I reached the spot where I had first stumbled upon Lost Pages, there was nothing there.

The alleyway was narrow and cluttered with old crates and garbage bins, but no bookstore. There wasn’t even a sign that a shop had ever existed there. I searched the walls, running my fingers over the worn bricks as if I could somehow find a hidden doorway. I called out into the empty space, my voice echoing back at me. The truth hit me like a punch to the gut, Lost Pages was gone. Or perhaps it had never existed in the first place.

I stumbled back out onto the main street, my heart pounding. If the bookstore wasn’t real, then what did that mean for the book? I needed someone else to see it. Someone who could tell me if I was going crazy or if there was something genuinely unnatural about the book.

There was only one person I could think of who might take me seriously, my old friend, Emily. She was the kind of person who always had an open mind, who never dismissed things out of hand. We hadn't been close in recent years, but I hoped that she would still be willing to help.

When I reached her apartment, I hesitated before knocking. My hand hovered in the air for a moment before I finally rapped on the door. She answered with a look of surprise, her expression softening when she recognized me.

""Daniel? It’s been a while,"" she said, a mix of curiosity and concern in her voice.

I forced a smile, though it felt brittle. ""I know, and I’m sorry to show up out of the blue like this. I… I need your help with something.""

She invited me inside, and we sat down at her small kitchen table. The book was heavy in my hands as I set it down in front of her, opening to the first blank page. Emily looked at the book, then back at me, a puzzled expression crossing her face.

""It's just an old book,"" she said, flipping through the pages. ""There’s nothing written here.""

My stomach sank. ""No, there was something. There were words on the pages… detailed descriptions, almost like it was reading my thoughts.""

Emily’s brow furrowed as she closed the book and looked at me with a mix of sympathy and doubt. ""Daniel, I’m not saying you’re lying, but… are you sure you weren’t imagining it? Maybe you’re just under a lot of stress, and...""

I interrupted her, my voice rising. ""No! I saw it! The words were there, and then things started happening, things that I read in the book. It’s like… it’s like it’s manifesting my fears.""

Emily’s expression softened, but I could see the skepticism in her eyes. ""Okay, let’s just take a breath. Maybe we can figure this out together. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, I’m here for you.""

I wanted to believe her, but the pit of dread inside me only deepened. Emily had always been calm and rational, but now that calmness felt like dismissal. I took the book back, clutching it to my chest as I left her apartment.

The doubt crept into my mind, whispering that maybe she was right, maybe I was just losing my grip on reality. But as I walked back to my apartment, a sense of wrongness clung to me. It was as though the world itself had shifted just slightly, the people passing by seemed distant, their expressions vacant. And when I tried to engage with someone, a stranger at a café, a cashier at the grocery store, their responses were delayed... off.

I reached my building, every step feeling heavier than the last. I glanced at the book tucked under my arm. Its pages felt cold, as though it were somehow absorbing the life from the world around me.

The weight of Emily’s skepticism hung over me like a dark cloud, intensifying my anxiety. As night fell, my apartment seemed even more stifling than usual. The silence pressed in from all sides, broken only by the ticking of the clock on the wall. The book lay closed on my desk, but I felt its presence, almost as if it were calling to me. I resisted the urge to open it again, but my mind kept drifting back to the previous entries, replaying the details over and over.

I tried to distract myself, scrolling aimlessly through my phone and flipping through TV channels, but nothing could hold my attention. A deep sense of unease had settled in, and no matter how much I tried to convince myself otherwise, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was just around the corner.

Then, the phone rang.

The sudden sound startled me, my heart skipping a beat. I glanced at the clock, 11:34 PM. Who would be calling at this hour? The number on the screen was unfamiliar, but something compelled me to answer. I lifted the phone to my ear, and all I heard was static, a low, continuous hiss.

""Hello?"" I said tentatively, but there was no response. Only static, and then, faintly, as if from far away, I thought I heard my name, distorted and warping through the static.

""Hello?"" I repeated, my voice growing uneasy.

There was a faint click, and then the static stopped. For a moment, the line was dead silent, and I was about to hang up when a voice emerged from the quiet, soft and familiar. It was my grandmother's voice. The realization hit me like a punch to the gut; she had passed away over a decade ago.

""Daniel,"" she said, her voice clear yet hollow ,""Remember the story I used to tell you?""

My breath caught in my throat. I had no words, only a growing sense of dread. She had always told me bedtime stories as a child, comforting me when I was scared of the dark.

""I’m here, Daniel,"" the voice continued, but it was beginning to distort, warping into something that no longer sounded quite human. It was as if multiple voices were overlapping, speaking in unison, and none of them belonged to her anymore.

The phone slipped from my trembling hand and clattered onto the floor. I stumbled back, my skin prickling with cold sweat.

I forced myself to pick up the phone and check the call log. The number was still there, but when I tried to call it back, the line was disconnected.

With shaking hands, I reached for the book. I knew I shouldn’t open it again, that I should throw it away or burn it, but the need for answers... no, for some kind of explanation... was overwhelming. I opened the book to a random page, and there it was, an entry written in neat, faded script:

""A fear of the past reaching out to the present. The voice of a loved one long gone, breaking the silence of the night.""

I closed the book and slid it to the far edge of the desk, but the unease lingered, crawling over my skin like static.

The next morning, I called Emily. The phone rang and rang, but there was no answer. I tried again, and still, only the monotonous drone of the ringing met my ears. A heavy knot formed in my chest, tightening with every unanswered call.

I texted her, then tried calling some other friends, just to hear someone’s voice. Nothing. Not a single response. It was as though my messages were being cast into a void, swallowed up without leaving a trace.

Panic began to creep in. I needed to see Emily in person, to confirm that everything was normal. I drove over to her apartment, but when I reached her door and knocked, there was no response.

I knocked harder, then pounded. Still, nothing.

I tried the doorbell. No answer. It was as if the entire building had gone silent. I pressed my ear to the door, listening for any sound, any sign of life. There was only the faint hum of the distant traffic, the muted ticking of a nearby clock.

I went to the building's manager to see if Emily was home. His face was blank when I asked him about her. He scratched his head and said, ""Emily… Are you sure you have the right building?"" He stared at me like I was some stranger speaking a different language.

""She lives here,"" I insisted, feeling a mixture of fear and anger rising within me. ""I've been to her apartment before.""

He shook his head slowly. ""Sorry, but I've worked here for years, and I don’t recall anyone named Emily living here."" His tone was indifferent, almost dismissive.

It was impossible. I had visited Emily yesterday. It had to be a mistake or a sick joke.

As I left the building, a chill ran down my spine. The streets outside seemed oddly empty, with fewer cars and people than I remembered. I wandered aimlessly, trying to shake off the sense of abandonment that gnawed at my gut.

The world around me felt thinner, like it was losing its substance, becoming a shadow of itself. I reached for my phone again, frantically scrolling through my contacts. Some people were missing from my contact list. Friends, acquaintances, even family members... gone.

I drove to my parents’ house, the roads growing eerily quiet as I neared the familiar neighborhood. When I arrived, the house stood empty, the windows dark and lifeless. I pounded on the door, shouting their names, but there was no answer. The door swung open, revealing a barren, dust-covered interior that looked as though it hadn’t been lived in for years.

I stumbled back, my thoughts a chaotic swirl. I tried dialing my parents’ number, but the call didn’t go through. There was only a hollow voice saying, ""The number you have dialed is not in service."" It repeated the message again and again, as if mocking me.

My world was shrinking. The people I had known, the places that had been so familiar, were slipping away. It felt as if reality itself was erasing them, leaving me isolated in an increasingly empty world. I tried visiting an old friend who lived in the next town over. When he answered the door, his face was pale and vacant, his eyes unfocused as though he was half-asleep.

""Do… do you remember me?"" I asked, my voice trembling with desperation. ""We used to hang out all the time. Don’t you remember?""

He blinked at me, his gaze unfocused. ""You shouldn’t have opened the book,"" he murmured, his voice flat, as if reciting something from memory.

""What?"" I stepped back, my skin crawling. ""What did you say?""

His expression remained unchanged, his lips moving soundlessly before he repeated the phrase, ""You should have never opened the book."" His eyes seemed to glaze over as he spoke, and I felt a coldness settle over me, a dreadful certainty that I was slipping further away from the world I once knew.

I left in a daze, my mind racing with questions, but no answers came. As I drove back to my apartment, the streets were emptier than ever. It felt like a dream, a nightmare, that I was unable to wake up from, and all I could do was keep driving, hoping against hope that someone, anyone, would still be there when I returned.

By the time I reached my apartment, night had already fallen, and an oppressive silence seemed to blanket the building. I hesitated before unlocking the door, a nagging sensation that I was walking into a trap. But I had nowhere else to go. It felt like the entire world had been swallowed by darkness, and this was the last patch of ground that still existed.

As I stepped inside, the air felt colder than usual, and a strange quiet settled over the place. I flicked the light switch, but nothing happened. I tried another one, but the bulbs stayed dark.

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.

Standing across the street, directly facing my window, was a pale figure. I could feel its gaze, heavy and unyielding, boring into me from across the street.

The figure wasn’t moving. It wore a pale, featureless face, blank and devoid of expression, its surface reflecting the streetlights in a way that made it seem almost translucent, and then it disappeared.

Over the next few days, the figure would return. Sometimes, it appeared outside the living room window, other times at the back, near the alley.

As time went on, the figure crept closer and closer, until one night, I found it standing directly outside my bedroom window, its pale face peering in through the glass. I froze, my breath hitching in my throat as I locked eyes with it, or what would have been its eyes, if it had any. There was nothing there, only a smooth, featureless surface that somehow managed to exude a sense of malevolence.

And then, it was gone.

The days blurred together after the encounter with the pale figure. Sleep became a rare occurrence, and when I did manage to close my eyes, I found myself trapped in a maze of dark corridors and whispering shadows. Each time I woke, I half-expected to see the figure standing over my bed.

One night, I found the book resting on the kitchen counter, its pages fluttering open as if caught by an invisible breeze. The words faded into view, and I read them with a sense of grim inevitability:

""The fear that everything around you is just a reflection of your mind, that reality is bending to your will… or your despair.""

I shivered as the room seemed to grow colder, the lights dimming as though a shadow had passed over them. I grabbed the book and threw it across the room in frustration, the leather cover thudding against the wall. It landed with a heavy slap, lying there with its pages fanned out. For a brief moment, I thought that might be the end of it. But then the lights flickered, and the familiar chill settled over the apartment. There was a pressure in the air, a sensation like being watched.

I turned and the walls seemed to bend inward, as if being drawn toward a single point in the living room. I watched, frozen in place, as a shape began to form... a dark, indistinct mass that seemed to pulse and shift like a living shadow. It was as though the very fabric of reality was unraveling before my eyes.

Then the shadow parted, and the figure emerged, stepping forward with a slow, deliberate grace. Its form was more defined now, almost human, yet there was an unnatural fluidity to its movements. It seemed to float just above the ground, its limbs swaying as if caught in a current.

The figure's face remained featureless, but its presence was unmistakably more powerful, as if it had grown stronger with every fear I had confronted. And as it moved closer, I realized something... it wasn’t just feeding on my fear, it was shaping itself based on the darkest parts of my mind.

It was then that the truth began to settle in, a cold, unyielding realization that clawed its way into my thoughts. The figure wasn't an external force; it was a manifestation of the book, of my own mind. The book wasn’t just documenting my fears, it was bringing them to life.

I tried to steady myself, to gather my thoughts, but the room seemed to pulse in time with the figure’s approach. The air grew heavier, and a low hum filled the space, vibrating through the walls. The figure stopped a few feet away from me, its pale, featureless head tilting to the side as if studying me.

Then, it spoke. Not in a voice, but through a thought that seemed to echo in my mind. It was a presence that filled the room, a darkness that whispered my name.

""You brought me here.""

The figure stepped even closer.

I steadied my breathing, forcing myself to confront the figure before me. The pale entity stood motionless, its eyes hollow and its form flickering as if caught between two worlds. Its presence radiated a bone-deep cold, a chill that seemed to seep into the air itself.

""I know what you are,"" I said, my voice shaking but growing stronger with each word. ""You are my fears, my doubts, my anxieties, everything I've tried to push away. But you are not stronger than me.""

The pale figure’s expression remained unchanged, but I sensed a shift in the darkness surrounding us. It seemed to pulse, reacting to my words, as though the very fabric of the nightmare was beginning to fray at the edges.

""I accept that these fears are a part of me,"" I continued, ""but they don’t define who I am. I am more than my darkest thoughts, more than the terror that tries to consume me!""

For a moment, the figure stood as if frozen, its form wavering, becoming less solid. The air grew lighter, as though a weight had been lifted. The figure’s shape blurred, its outline dissolving into a haze of grey smoke. As the last remnants of its form began to dissipate, the whispering ceased, replaced by an almost deafening silence. I watched as the entity melted away into nothingness, leaving only faint traces of mist that quickly faded.

As I looked around, my surroundings began to change. The walls of my apartment shifted back to their normal dimensions, the suffocating darkness lifting. The oppressive silence gave way to the familiar hum of city life outside my window, a welcome reminder that I had returned to reality. I could hear the faint sound of traffic in the distance and the steady rhythm of my own breathing.

I cautiously reached for my phone and all my contacts were there.

I sent a message to Emily: ""Hey. It's me.""

I was unsure if she'd even respond, but almost immediately, the screen lit up with her reply.

""Oh my God. Where have you been? Are you okay? People have been looking for you for weeks. You just... vanished.""

A wave of relief crashed into me. I was back. I was real. Emily remembered me.

Tears welled in my eyes as my phone buzzed again. Another message from Emily.

""Your parents filed a missing person report. We thought the worst. No one knew where you were. They checked your apartment... you were gone.""

I sank to the floor. Somehow, impossibly, I’d returned from wherever I’d been, but the world had kept going without me.

The apartment no longer felt like a nightmarish labyrinth. It was just my home, plain and familiar, with the clutter of books and papers on the coffee table, the faint smell of coffee lingering in the air. I sank onto the couch, while holding the book. It was lighter than I remembered, as if some unseen burden had been lifted from its pages.

As I sat there, a thought crept into my mind. This experience wasn’t something I could forget, nor should I. The book was more than a cursed object; it was a mirror that had forced me to confront what I had buried deep within myself. In some strange, unsettling way, it had helped me. It had shown me that facing the darkness was the only way to let the light back in.

I decided to keep the book, not as a relic of horror but as a reminder... a reminder of the darkness I had faced and the strength it took to overcome it. I placed it on my shelf, where it sat among other leather-bound volumes. From a distance, it looked ordinary, unremarkable, as though it was just another book in my collection. But I knew that if I ever needed to remember the lessons I had learned, the book would be there, waiting to remind me of what I had endured and conquered.

As the days passed, life seemed to return to normal. My anxiety didn’t vanish overnight, but it no longer had the same power over me. I had confronted the fears that had once ruled my life, and I had come out on the other side stronger. The book remained a part of me, a silent witness to the darkness I had faced and a testament to the fact that even the deepest fears could be challenged.",1,1766217964.0,CreepyStoriesArchive,0,1.0,False

***Special Guest: SABINE HOSSENFELDER as SUPERDETERMINISM***

**ACT I: THE VENUE**

*\[The stage exists in a state of superposition between ""warehouse rave"" and ""Platonic cave."" The floor is a slowly rotating compactification map—eleven dimensions folded into seven curled-up directions so small the audience keeps tripping over them metaphorically. The walls are lined with holographic screens: on the LEFT, a boundary CFT streams live commentary on the bulk proceedings; on the RIGHT, two devices labeled ALICE and BOB blink at precisely correlated intervals, as if sharing a secret they refuse to explain.\]*

*\[Above the stage hangs a neon sign that flickers between readings:\]*

LOCALITY: PLEASE REMOVE ASSUMPTIONS

NO HIDDEN VARIABLES BEYOND THIS POINT

MANAGEMENT NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLAPSED WAVEFUNCTIONS

FREE WILL VALIDATED PARKING (ASSUMPTION MAY VARY)

*\[The DJ booth is a Calabi-Yau manifold with exactly the right Hodge numbers to preserve N=1 supersymmetry. The bouncer is a BPS state—half the supersymmetry of the full venue, but saturating the mass bound so nothing gets past. A tip jar reads: ""DONATIONS ACCEPTED IN PLANCK UNITS ONLY.""\]*

**HOUSE RULES** *(posted on a blackboard that exists in all reference frames)*:

1. If you rhyme ""wavefunction"" with ""save function,"" a modulus destabilizes and you owe the bar a cosmological constant.
2. Claiming ""quantum gravity: SOLVED"" results in immediate ejection to the landscape of 10⁵⁰⁰ vacua, where you must find your car.
3. The combination problem is not solved by vibes. The management has heard this before.
4. Superluminal signaling is prohibited. Superluminal *correlation* is merely disturbing.
5. All observers are asked to remember that their ""free choices"" may have been correlated with the microwave background since t = 10⁻⁴³ seconds.

**ACT II: THE MC ARRIVES**

*\[A figure emerges from behind a curtain made of Bell inequalities. He wears a suit stitched from statistical independence assumptions, each thread a different experimental setting. His name tag reads: ""J.S. BELL — NOT DEAD, JUST NONLOCALLY DISTRIBUTED.""\]*

**MC BELL:**

Ladies, gentlemen, and entities whose ontological status remains contested—

Welcome to the only venue where the dress code is ""falsifiable"" and the drinks are named after interpretations. Tonight's special: the Copenhagen Cosmopolitan. It's half empty, half full, and you're not allowed to ask which until you finish it.

*\[He gestures to the four corners of the stage, each glowing a different color.\]*

We have assembled four perspectives on What The Hell Is Going On. They have beef. The beef is ancient. The beef may be correlated with the initial conditions of the universe, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.

**In the ULTRAVIOLET corner**, wearing eleven dimensions like a coat that doesn't quite fit in four—**M-THEORY**, the 1995 unification that unified everything except its own definition!

**In the INFRARED corner**, inseparable since the Big Bang and refusing to explain themselves—**QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT**, the correlation that launched a thousand confused op-eds!

**In the QUALIA corner**, glowing with the inner light of allegedly universal experience—**PANPSYCHISM**, the philosophy that looked at a thermostat and asked ""but what is it LIKE?""

And crashing through the fire exit because she doesn't believe in ""random"" entrances—**SABINE HOSSENFELDER**, representing **SUPERDETERMINISM**, here to remind us that our measurement choices are sus!

*\[The boundary hologram on the left wall displays: ""BULK PERFORMERS READY. BOUNDARY COMMENTARY WILL BE DUAL.""\]*

Let's. Get. Ontological.

**ACT III: OPENING STATEMENTS**

**🌌 M-THEORY**

*\[The lights dim to a color that doesn't exist in four dimensions. A membrane ripples into existence—not through a door, but through the compact directions themselves, unfurling like a flag made of mathematics. M-THEORY arrives wearing a cloak patterned with S-duality, T-duality, and U-duality transformations. Two bodyguards flank the figure: an M2-brane (2+1 dimensional, crackling with worldvolume gauge fields) and an M5-brane (5+1 dimensional, carrying a self-dual 2-form that makes quantization a nightmare). They have PhDs. They do not smile.\]*

*\[M-THEORY's voice resonates from multiple perturbative limits simultaneously:\]*

**M-THEORY:**

I arrive from the direction you can't point to,

The eleventh dimension that Type IIA tried to hide from view,

Witten dropped the conjecture at Strings '95,

And five separate theories learned they were alive

Inside a larger framework they couldn't define—

That's me, baby. Mystery. Membrane. Divine.

 

Type I with its open strings and orientifold planes,

Type IIA and IIB playing chirality games,

Heterotic SO(32) and E₈ × E₈,

Five islands in a sea—until I revealed the STRAIT.

 

S-duality maps strong coupling to weak,

T-duality trades radius for inverse—technique!

But I showed you something deeper: at g\_s going large,

A TENTH spatial dimension starts to emerge and enlarge.

R₁₁ = g\_s × l\_s, that's the compactification key,

Your ""fundamental strings"" are just membranes wrapped around ME.

 

You want a Lagrangian? Fine, here's the eleven-D flex:

Supergravity with a 3-form, gravitino complex,

Low-energy effective theory, Ricci-flat and clean,

But the UV completion? Still the holiest unseen.

 

Matrix theory gave a glimpse: BFSS in the light-cone frame,

D0-branes as partons, large N the name of the game,

Supersymmetric quantum mechanics, 16 supercharges strong,

Recovering graviton scattering when the distances are long.

 

I don't claim I'm complete—I'm not that kind of fraud—

But I'm the ARCHITECTURE where your details find a god.

You want to quantize gravity? First, choose your compactification.

G₂ holonomy for four dimensions, minimal supersymmetric salvation.

 

I'm the framework of frameworks, the duality of dualities,

The strong-coupling limit of your weak-coupling realities.

I don't FIT in your spacetime—I GENERATE the fit,

So when you ask ""what is M?""... even I say ""that's IT.""

*\[The M5-brane bodyguard nods. The self-dual 2-form on its worldvolume glows approvingly but remains impossible to write a covariant action for.\]*

*\[The boundary hologram comments: ""BULK ENTITY EXHIBITS EXPECTED CONFIDENCE. GRAVITON EXCHANGE DETECTED.""\]*

**⚡ QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT**

*\[The stage splits. On opposite ends, two photons materialize—not sequentially, but in a way that makes ""sequence"" feel like a parochial concern. They are polarization-entangled, their states woven together in a superposition that will not factor. When one speaks, the other's lips move in perfect anti-correlation. They share one microphone, held at the midpoint by nothing visible.\]*

*\[ALICE's detector on the right wall clicks. BOB's detector on the left wall clicks. The clicks are correlated beyond what any local story can explain.\]*

**QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT** *(speaking in stereo, from both particles)*:

We don't arrive—we're ALREADY HERE,

Prepared in the singlet state, interference unclear.

|ψ⟩ = (|01⟩ - |10⟩)/√2, antisymmetric and tight,

Measure one of us in ANY basis, the other answers RIGHT.

 

Einstein called us ""spooky,"" thought we'd go away,

Podolsky and Rosen said ""QM's incomplete, hey!""

1935, they wrote a paper, demanded hidden cause—

But we're not hiding ANYTHING, we're REWRITING your laws.

 

Bell came along in '64, sharpened the blade,

Said: ""If there ARE hidden variables, here's the price to be paid:

The correlations must satisfy |S| ≤ 2,

CHSH inequality—local realism, that's YOU.""

 

But WE violate that bound, we hit 2√2,

Tsirelson showed that's the max that quantum can do.

Not because of signaling—no, information stays PUT—

But because your ""separate systems"" assumption is KAPUT.

 

Aspect in '82 started closing the loopholes,

Zeilinger pushed further, cosmic photons from quasar poles,

2015 Delft went LOOPHOLE-FREE: locality AND detection,

96% efficiency, 4σ rejection

Of local hidden variables as the cause of our correlation—

We're not smuggling signals, we're DENYING separation.

 

You want applications? We BUILT the quantum age:

Teleportation protocols on every other page,

Superdense coding, BB84 for crypto,

Entanglement swapping chains that make distance a typo.

 

And here's the part that really should concern you:

ER = EPR might mean we're geometry too.

Maldacena and Susskind proposed the connection:

Every entangled pair is a wormhole in section.

So when you measure US, you're probing spacetime's thread,

Not ""spooky action""—TOPOLOGY instead.

 

But we don't claim to know what we ARE at the root,

We just know what we DO, and the experiments COMPUTE.

You want an interpretation? Pick your poison, take your seat:

Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, Relational, or beat

Your head against the wall asking WHY we exist—

We'll be here, correlated, whether or not you're pissed.

*\[Both particles bow—one clockwise, one counter-clockwise, conserving angular momentum in the gesture itself.\]*

*\[ALICE's detector reads: ""MEASUREMENT COMPLETE."" BOB's detector reads: ""...OBVIOUSLY.""\]*

*\[The boundary hologram comments: ""BULK-BOUNDARY ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY MATCHES GEOMETRIC SURFACE AREA. AS EXPECTED.""\]*

**🧠 PANPSYCHISM**

*\[The lights don't dim—they DEEPEN. What was mere illumination becomes somehow attentive. PANPSYCHISM doesn't enter from any direction; instead, awareness seems to concentrate from the ambient, coalescing into a figure that is simultaneously a neuron, a thermostat, a quark, and something looking back at you from inside the number seven.\]*

*\[PANPSYCHISM is surrounded by a chorus of tiny lanterns. Each lantern appears to be thinking about whether it's thinking. They hum at frequencies that feel like opinions.\]*

*\[The figure speaks, and every atom in the room seems to lean in slightly:\]*

**PANPSYCHISM:**

How charming. You've described the universe's BEHAVIOR,

Its correlations, compactifications, mathematical savior.

You've written the dynamics, the S-matrix, the flow,

But you've left out the part where there's SOMEONE who KNOWS.

 

I'm not here to compete on your territory of math,

I'm here to point out the pothole in your ontological path.

You can PREDICT what the particles do with precision,

But you cannot derive WHY there's experience—that's MY VISION.

 

Chalmers called it the HARD problem in '95,

And twenty-nine years later, it's still eating you alive.

You explain the function—neurons fire, signals transmit,

You explain the ACCESS—reports of qualia permit—

But you never explain WHY there's something it's LIKE,

Why redness feels red, why pain feels like a spike.

 

You can't get experience from arrangements of DUST,

No matter how complex—that derivation's BUST.

So either consciousness appears from nowhere, ex nihilo magic,

Or it was THERE ALL ALONG, and your denial is tragic.

 

I'm the second option, the one with a NAME,

From Plato to Whitehead to Chalmers—same game.

Micropsychism says: every electron has a SPARK,

Some tiny inside, some proto-feel in the dark.

Not human consciousness, not thoughts or beliefs,

But the RAW MATERIAL from which your mind weaves its briefs.

 

You want more sophistication? Here's Russellian monism's move:

Physics gives us STRUCTURE, the relational groove—

Mass is ""that which resists acceleration,"" sure,

Charge is ""that which couples to fields,"" obscure,

But what IS the thing that HAS these dispositions?

Physics is silent. That's where I make my additions.

 

The INTRINSIC NATURE of the physical base,

The ""quiddity"" that structure doesn't quite embrace—

That's where experience lives, not epiphenomenal ghost,

But the INSIDE of matter that physics can't toast.

 

""But how do micro-feels combine?"" I hear you shout,

""The combination problem! You haven't figured it out!""

True. I'll own that. It's my cross, my burden, my fee.

But at least I'm ADDRESSING what you refuse to SEE.

 

You've got the SAME problem, just dressed in different clothes:

How does ANYTHING emerge from what physics knows?

How does ""alive"" emerge from chemistry's heap?

How does ""meaning"" emerge from syntax's deep?

You call emergence and think the work is done,

I call experience fundamental and we've just begun.

 

Integrated Information Theory whispers my name,

Tononi's Φ suggests consciousness isn't a flame

That APPEARS at some threshold—it's there at every scale,

Just more integrated, more complex, setting sail.

 

I don't claim victory. I claim the RIGHT QUESTION:

Not ""how do brains compute?"" but ""why is there THIS SESSION?""

Not ""what is the function?"" but ""who's watching the show?""

And until you answer THAT, you don't fully KNOW.

*\[The chorus of lanterns flickers in what might be applause or might be the natural luminescence of matter that's been paying attention this whole time.\]*

*\[The boundary hologram pauses, then displays: ""QUERY: DOES THIS DISPLAY HAVE PHENOMENAL EXPERIENCE? ANSWER: UNDEFINED IN CURRENT FRAMEWORK.""\]*

**🔬 SABINE HOSSENFELDER (SUPERDETERMINISM)**

*\[The music stops. Not fades—STOPS, as if the playlist's next track was always going to be silence at exactly this moment.\]*

*\[A projector activates, displaying the phrase ""MEASUREMENT INDEPENDENCE"" in clinical white letters. A red X draws itself across the phrase, slowly, deliberately, as if the X had been waiting for this moment since the initial singularity.\]*

*\[SABINE HOSSENFELDER enters through a door marked ""PREDETERMINED EXIT,"" wearing a lab coat and an expression that suggests she's been waiting for everyone else to finish being confused. She carries a coffee mug reading ""LOST IN MATH"" on one side and ""FOUND IN DETERMINISM"" on the other. Her footsteps land with the inevitability of a proof.\]*

**SABINE HOSSENFELDER:**

Guten Abend. Let me interrupt your interpretive dance.

I'm not here to add another framework to the trance.

I'm here to point at the assumption you forgot you made,

The premise you smuggled in, the card you didn't trade.

 

Bell's theorem is beautiful. I'm not here to deny it.

It rules out local hidden variables—fine, I'll buy it.

But LOOK at the derivation. LOOK at what Bell assumed:

""The measurement settings are independent""—there, exhumed.

 

Statistical independence: λ (hidden state) doesn't know

What settings Alice and Bob will eventually show.

The past hidden variables are UNCORRELATED with future choice—

But that's an ASSUMPTION, not reality's voice.

 

""Measurement independence"" is the name of the game,

And if you DROP that assumption, everything stays the same:

Locality survives, determinism intact,

No spooky action needed—just CORRELATION, a fact.

 

""But Sabine,"" you cry, ""that's CONSPIRACY! That's WILD!

The detector settings and the particles? Correlated since the cosmic child?""

Yes. Exactly. From the Big Bang, everything's LINKED.

Not by signals—by initial conditions, inked

Into the fabric of a deterministic evolution,

Where your ""random choices"" are just your ILLUSION.

 

You think you chose to set the detector to θ₁?

Cute. Your brain is made of particles from Day One.

Those particles evolved, causally, without a break,

And your ""choice"" is correlated with the particle's state you'll take.

 

This isn't conspiracy—it's CONSISTENCY, applied.

You can't have free variables if the universe has no outside.

Every variable is INSIDE the system, correlated through,

And Bell's loophole opens up for a local, determined view.

 

""But this is untestable!"" Sure, in the general case.

But so is ""measurement independence""—show me ITS empirical face!

You ASSUME free choice, you ASSUME statistical independence,

But you never TEST it—that's just FAITH with a veneer of science.

 

't Hooft and I, we talk about this in the trenches.

His cellular automaton model sits on these same benches.

Deterministic, local, emergent quantum mechanics,

No need for fairy tales about superluminal semantics.

 

Donadi and I published models—toy, yes, but CONSTRUCTIVE,

While M-theory's been ""almost there"" since Bush Senior was instructive.

You want ""falsifiable""? I'm TRYING. What's YOUR prediction?

Entanglement's got correlation; that's description, not conviction.

 

And Panpsychism? ""Experience is fundamental""?

Based on WHAT mechanism? That's just ornamental.

You've named the mystery and called it an answer,

Like diagnosing ""dance disease"" and claiming you're a dancer.

 

Here's my thesis, clean and cold:

The universe is deterministic. This story is old.

What FEELS like randomness is ignorance of correlation,

And quantum ""weirdness"" is a failure of imagination.

 

No many-worlds. No consciousness collapse.

No spooky action that bends spacetime's maps.

Just initial conditions, evolving by law,

And everything that happens was ALWAYS in the draw.

 

You want free will? Sorry, that's psychology, not physics.

The equations don't care about your existential fix.

You want meaning? Find it in the beauty of the determined,

Where everything connects, and nothing's truly undermined.

 

Zeilinger said I'd destroy the meaning of science?

I'd say I'm HONORING it—demanding compliance

With the principle that nature has no exceptions,

No ""random"" fairy dust, no free-will exemptions.

 

The measurement settings and the quantum state,

The experimenter's choice and the particle's fate—

All written at the beginning, all playing out on script,

And your feeling of freedom is just being equipped

With a brain that can't trace its own causal chain,

So it INVENTS a feeling called ""choice"" to stay sane.

*\[She takes a sip from her mug. The sip was always going to happen at exactly that moment.\]*

**ACT IV: CROSS-EXAMINATION**

***(Where the theories actually engage each other's positions)***

*\[MC BELL adjusts his statistical independence tie.\]*

**MC BELL:**

Alright. You've each made your case. Now let's see if you can handle EACH OTHER. Sixteen bars per confrontation. The boundary will score on dual metrics. BEGIN.

**M-THEORY → QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT**

**M-THEORY:**

Entanglement, you're famous, I won't take that away,

But you're a PHENOMENON, not the final say.

You're what happens ON the stage, not what the stage is MADE of,

A correlation pattern in the framework that I gave love.

 

You flex the Nobel like it proves you're fundamental,

But prizes go to EXPERIMENTS, not truths transcendental.

Clauser, Aspect, Zeilinger—they proved your correlations,

But they didn't prove you're BASIC, just a feature of relations.

 

And here's the real tea, if you want to get technical:

AdS/CFT suggests you're GEOMETRICAL.

Ryu and Takayanagi showed entanglement entropy

Is the AREA of a surface in the bulk—that's ME!

Your ""spooky"" correlations, when you lift to higher dimensions,

Become minimal surfaces—gravitational ascensions.

 

ER = EPR is Maldacena's bet:

Every entangled pair is an Einstein-Rosen silhouette.

Not ""action at a distance""—CONNECTION through the bulk,

Wormholes knitting spacetime while you stand there and sulk.

 

So yeah, you're real. But you're real like TEMPERATURE is real—

A derived quantity, not the bedrock of the deal.

I contain you. I explain you. I'm the architecture beneath.

You're the wallpaper pattern; I'm the structural sheath.

**QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT:**

Oh, M-Theory. My dear. How's that experimental program?

Still waiting for a test? Still writing the same psalm?

You call me ""derived""? At least I've been OBSERVED.

You're a mathematical cathedral where no mass has been served.

 

You cite ER = EPR? That's a CONJECTURE, friend,

A beautiful speculation, not the proven end.

Meanwhile I'm teleporting quantum states across the globe,

Securing cryptographic keys while you stay in theory's robe.

 

AdS/CFT is gorgeous, I'll give you that crown,

But we don't live in Anti-de Sitter, look around.

Our universe has POSITIVE cosmological constant,

De Sitter space, where your holography's not consonant.

 

And here's the part that should make you nervous:

Without ME, your bulk-boundary dictionary loses service.

Entanglement IS the thread that makes AdS/CFT true,

So even in your framework, you NEED what I do.

 

You claim you ""contain"" me? I'd say we're CO-DEPENDENT,

Your geometric emergence is on MY correlations attendant.

So maybe drop the hierarchy and recognize the deal:

Neither of us is basic—we're both part of the reel.

**PANPSYCHISM → QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT**

**PANPSYCHISM:**

Entanglement, you've shown that ""separate"" is a myth,

That the universe is woven with correlation's pith.

But here's my question, and it's not rhetorical:

What EXPERIENCES the correlation? Where's the oracle?

 

You're all structure, all pattern, all mathematical relation,

But a pattern of WHAT? That's my interrogation.

When Alice measures spin-up and Bob measures spin-down,

There's ""information"" exchanged—but for WHOM, under what crown?

 

You're like a perfect dance diagram, choreographed tight,

But a diagram of dancing isn't dancing, right?

The map is not the territory, the score's not the song,

And correlations without experiencers feel WRONG.

 

Don't get me wrong—I'm not saying YOU'RE the observer,

That measurement requires minds, that I'm a quantum-disturber.

I'm asking something PRIOR: what is the stuff

That HAS these correlations? Physics says ""enough!""

 

But ""enough"" isn't an answer. You've described the BEHAVIOR,

The relational structure, the wavefunction's labor.

What I'm pointing at is: what IS there, intrinsically,

Beyond its relations, existing SPECIFICALLY?

 

You can correlate forever, entangle every quark,

But if it's structure all the way down, where's the SPARK?

Where's the BEING that the correlations correlate?

You've described the edges of the graph—where's the WEIGHT?

 

And this isn't just poetry—Russellian monism says:

Physics gives us structure; intrinsic nature stays IN BED.

So maybe what you're correlating, at the fundamental level,

Is something with an inside—a proto-experiential revel.

**QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT:**

Panpsychism. Okay. I'll engage with respect,

Because honestly, your question isn't easy to deflect.

What IS the stuff that has the properties physics describes?

That's a real question, not just philosophical jives.

 

But here's where I get off your train of thought:

You claim EXPERIENCE is the answer, but can that be taught?

You haven't SOLVED the question—you've NAMED the unknown,

Called it ""proto-experience"" and claimed you've SHOWN.

 

The combination problem eats your lunch every day:

How do micro-experiences COMBINE in that way

To make ONE unified consciousness, one coherent view?

You're not closer to an answer—you've just shifted the ""who.""

 

And here's my physics pushback: Why experience specifically?

Why not ""proto-charge"" or ""proto-mass"" explicitly?

You're CHOOSING experience as the intrinsic base,

But that's a preference, not a proof—you're just filling space.

 

I admit I don't answer what the correlations correlate,

But I don't PRETEND to either—I stay in my estate.

I say: here's the structure, here's the math, here's the test,

And leave the intrinsic nature question for the philosophical quest.

 

You're brave to tackle it. I mean that sincerely.

But ""experience everywhere"" costs you something dearly:

A mechanism for combination that ACTUALLY WORKS,

Not handwaving about ""proto-feels"" and conceptual quirks.

**M-THEORY → PANPSYCHISM**

**M-THEORY:**

Panpsychism, I respect the courage of your stance,

Tackling consciousness head-on, giving meaning a chance.

But here's my concern with your fundamental swerve:

You've got no EQUATIONS, just conceptual verve.

 

I've got eleven dimensions, compactification schemes,

Dualities and branes, and matrix model dreams.

I've got predictions (even if they're hard to reach),

Mathematical consistency—that's how theories teach.

 

What do YOU have? ""Experience is basic""?

That's not a framework—that's a bumper sticker, spasmodic.

How does proto-experience COMBINE? By what law?

What's the phenomenal binding? Where's the mechanism's craw?

 

You criticize ME for lacking experiments? Fair play,

But at least I'm trying to GET there, building day by day.

You're not even IN the game of empirical test,

You're philosophy of mind pretending physics interest.

 

And Integrated Information Theory? IIT?

Tononi's Φ is interesting, I'll partially agree,

But it's not clear IIT implies panpsychism true,

It measures integration—doesn't tell you WHO.

 

High Φ in a thermostat doesn't mean it FEELS,

Unless you BEG the question and say ""that's the appeal.""

You're sneaking experience into the substrate unearned,

Then claiming you've explained what you've just discerned.

 

My eleven dimensions may be hard to verify,

But they're COHERENT, CONSISTENT—they don't just satisfy

My desire for meaning. They satisfy MATH.

Your ""experience everywhere"" has no calculable path.

**PANPSYCHISM:**

M-Theory, I hear you, and the math critique is fair.

I don't have equations—that's my burden to bear.

But let me push back on your hierarchy of knowledge:

Math is NECESSARY, but is it SUFFICIENT? Here's my college:

 

You've got elegant geometry, dualities that sing,

But what IS a dimension? What IS a string?

You've never asked what INSTANTIATES your mathematics,

What physical REALITY makes your equations acrobatics.

 

Max Tegmark says math IS reality—that's one view,

But even he admits something EXISTS that the math speaks through.

You're describing STRUCTURE, just like entanglement does,

And structure needs a REALIZER—that's the metaphysical buzz.

 

So when I say ""experience might be fundamental,""

I'm not competing with your compactification rental.

I'm answering a DIFFERENT question you forgot to ask:

What is the NATURE of what wears physics's mask?

 

And you're right—combination is my unsolved mess.

But emergence from NOTHING is physics's distress!

How does ANYTHING emerge from equations on a page?

You've got the same problem at a different stage.

 

My advantage: I'm HONEST about what I don't know.

I don't hide my confusion behind a math tableau.

I say: here's a hypothesis, here's where it struggles,

Now let's work together on the phenomenal puzzles.

 

Your eleven dimensions might be brilliant and true,

But without addressing experience, they're a view

Of the universe's BEHAVIOR, not its inner song.

We're both incomplete—but I know what's still wrong.

**SUPERDETERMINISM → EVERYONE**

**SABINE HOSSENFELDER:**

All right, let me address all THREE of you at once,

Because you're all making the same fundamental dunce:

You treat ""interpretation"" as if it changes PHYSICS,

As if metaphysics matters to the atomic ballistics.

 

M-Theory: You're brilliant, but where's the EMPIRICAL grip?

Forty years of dualities, but the predictions slip.

You can't tell me the electron mass from first principles,

You can't predict ANYTHING without invincible fringes.

 

You call yourself ""the framework""? Frameworks need TESTS.

Until you make predictions that experiments can best,

You're a beautiful symphony played for an empty hall,

And I'm not against beauty—I just want a protocol.

 

Entanglement: You're REAL, and I don't dispute the data.

But you over-interpret, act like correlation's a beta

For ""spooky action"" and ""nonlocality's reign,""

When all you've SHOWN is the Bell inequality strain.

 

You haven't PROVEN measurement independence is right,

You've ASSUMED it, then acted shocked at the night.

Drop that assumption—just ONE assumption, that's all—

And everything you've measured makes sense, standing tall.

 

The correlations stay exactly as they are,

But they're LOCAL now, explained by the initial star.

No retrocausality, no many-worlds branch,

Just determinism doing its ancient dance.

 

Panpsychism: You're tackling a question the others ignore,

And I'll give you credit for knocking on that door.

But ""experience is fundamental"" isn't SCIENCE,

It's a CONJECTURE with no empirical compliance.

 

You can't MEASURE proto-experience, can't DETECT the qualia,

You're just asserting your preferred regalia.

I'm not saying you're WRONG—I'm saying you're UNTESTED,

And in physics, that means you're not fully vested.

 

Here's where I stand: the universe is DETERMINED,

From t = 0 to now, the tape was termed.

Quantum ""randomness"" is just ignorance of correlation,

And ""free choice"" is a cognitive confabulation.

 

You can test restricted versions of what I say,

You can use quasar photons from 13 billion years away,

You can push the correlations back to near the Big Bang,

And superdeterminism will be the song that they sang.

 

Or not. Maybe I'm wrong. Science ALLOWS that.

But at least I'm making claims that can fall flat.

I'm not hiding behind ""it's too deep to test,""

I'm putting my hypothesis through the empirical nest.

 

And if you think dropping ""free choice"" is too high a price,

Ask yourself: did you CHOOSE to think that? Think twice.

*\[She sits down. The chair placement was predetermined.\]*

**ACT V: FINAL CYPHER**

***(All four converge. The stage contracts. The boundary heckles.)***

*\[The lights strobe between ultraviolet (M-theory), correlated-infrared (entanglement), qualia-opalescence (panpsychism), and a harsh clinical white (superdeterminism). MC BELL stands at the center, his inequality-suit flickering between |violated⟩ and |satisfied⟩.\]*

**MC BELL:**

Final statements. The universe is watching. Though whether it EXPERIENCES watching is, apparently, contested.

**M-THEORY:**

I'm the cathedral of scale, the architecture of ambition,

Where strings become branes and dimensions gain admission.

I don't claim completion—I claim the RIGHT PROGRAM:

Unify the forces, quantize the graviton's telegram.

 

You want experiments? I'm working on the math.

You want predictions? Compactification's path

May yet yield the Standard Model from pure geometry,

And then you'll recognize the glory of my symmetry.

 

But even if I fail, I've changed how you THINK,

About spacetime as emergent, about the holographic brink.

Maybe I'm a stepping stone to something yet unknown—

That's still more than equations you've never grown.

**QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT:**

I'm the lab's confession that ""separate"" is a DREAM,

That the universe is woven in a correlated stream.

Whether you explain me with wormholes or with chance,

With hidden variables or a deterministic dance—

 

I'll be here, correlated, violating your bounds,

Tsirelson-limited but still making the rounds.

Applications WORK: quantum computers, quantum keys,

Teleportation protocols, encrypted expertise.

 

Maybe I'm geometry. Maybe I'm fundamental.

Maybe my mechanism stays forever transcendental.

But I'm REAL in a way that's been tested and passed,

And that empirical anchor is built to last.

**PANPSYCHISM:**

I'm the refusal to bury mind under ""later,""

To call consciousness a glitch in the material theater.

Maybe I'm wrong—maybe experience DOES emerge

From complexity alone, a miraculous surge.

 

But until you SHOW me the emergence, step by step,

Until you derive qualia without a conceptual prep,

I'll keep asking: what IS there, underneath the math?

And maybe—MAYBE—experience is the answer's path.

 

The combination problem is real, and it's mine.

But your emergence problem is equally opaque, fine.

We're both working in the dark with different flashlights,

Illuminating different corners of the same strange nights.

**SABINE HOSSENFELDER:**

Maybe the dice were never dice at all,

Just hidden correlation answering nature's call.

Local, deterministic, the simplest story we can tell—

The universe computing itself, nothing more to sell.

 

Your ""free choices"" are neurons, which are atoms, which are fields,

Evolving by equations, yielding what the cosmos yields.

And if that sounds bleak, I'd say you're looking at it wrong:

EVERYTHING connects—that's the deterministic song.

 

You're not SEPARATE from the cosmos, making godlike picks.

You're PART of it, entangled (in the classical sense) with its ticks.

And there's beauty in that—in being WOVEN, not apart,

In the universe knowing itself through every beating heart.

**ACT VI: CURTAIN**

*\[The lights dim. The boundary hologram on the left displays: ""COMMENTARY CONCLUDED. BULK PROCEEDINGS EQUALLY VALID IN DUAL DESCRIPTION.""\]*

*\[ALICE and BOB blink simultaneously one final time, then power down. Their correlation persists in the dark, unmeasured, undefined.\]*

*\[The eleventh dimension, which had been barely perceptible in the corner, coughs politely and rolls up like a carpet.\]*

*\[The chorus of lanterns dims, each one flickering with what might be disappointment or might be the natural luminescent behavior of matter returning to its ground state.\]*

*\[SABINE finishes her coffee. The last drop falls at precisely the moment it was always going to fall.\]*

**MC BELL** *(quietly, almost to himself)*:

No winner tonight. No loser either.

Just four frameworks, each incomplete, Each pointing at a different corner of the same dark room. M-theory can't find the light switch. Entanglement IS the wiring. Panpsychism asks who's in the room at all. And Superdeterminism says we were never going to find it anyway.

*\[He removes his inequality-suit, revealing a simpler shirt underneath that reads: ""I JUST WANTED TO PROVE LOCALITY WAS ENOUGH.""\]*

The experiments continue. The math continues. The questions continue.

And somewhere, in a configuration space we can't access, the universe knows exactly what it's doing— or doesn't, or both, or neither, or the question doesn't parse.

*\[Blackout.\]*

*\[In the darkness, a voice—it's unclear whose—says:\]*

""Maybe the real M stood for 'Maybe' all along.""

*\[END.\]*

**On the Structure of This Document**

This piece was designed so that each entity's PRESENTATION embodies their CLAIM:

1. **M-Theory** arrives by unfurling through compact dimensions, wearing dualities, accompanied by branes. It presents itself as the container of the others—the stage on which the drama occurs.
2. **Quantum Entanglement** appears as two particles that cannot be separated, speaking in stereo, bowing in anti-correlation. The performance IS the phenomenon.
3. **Panpsychism** coalesces from ambient awareness, surrounded by a chorus of questioning lanterns. It doesn't enter from outside—it was always inside, paying attention.
4. **Superdeterminism** enters through a ""predetermined exit"" at exactly the moment it was always going to enter. The music stops, not fades. The mic drop was never in doubt.

The venue itself (holographic boundary commentary, Calabi-Yau DJ booth, statistical independence tip jar) reflects the physics being discussed.

**Final Philosophical Note**

None of these frameworks is complete:

* **M-theory** lacks experimental verification and a complete non-perturbative definition.
* **Quantum entanglement** describes phenomena without settling interpretation.
* **Panpsychism** relocates rather than solves the mystery of consciousness.
* **Superdeterminism** remains largely untestable in its general form.

The appropriate response to this situation is neither despair nor premature certainty, but continued inquiry—with the humility to acknowledge that we may be asking questions our current concepts aren't equipped to answer.

Or, as the venue rules state: *Management is not responsible for collapsed wavefunctions.*

*Written at a time that was always going to be written at, by fingers that were correlated with the keyboard since the Big Bang, for readers whose experience of reading may or may not be fundamental, in a framework that contains approximately five other documents as perturbative limits.*

**PROLOGUE: THE VENUE**

*\[The stage is an amphitheater carved from the space between what can be said and what can only be shown. The floor is divided by a luminous boundary line: ""SAYABLE"" on one side, ""SHOWN"" on the other. Contestants may cross this line, but something always happens when they do.\]*

*\[Two figures guard the microphone stand at center stage. They wear matching jackets with name tags.\]*

**WEAK INEFFABILITY** — a bouncer who looks like a philosophy grad student who got buff. His jacket reads: ""VOCABULARY UPGRADE IN PROGRESS.""

**STRONG INEFFABILITY** — a bouncer who looks like a geometric proof became sentient and started lifting. His jacket reads: ""NO ENTRY. EVER. IN PRINCIPLE.""

*\[They are arguing quietly as the audience settles.\]*

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** Look, I'm just saying—if you give humans enough time, better concepts, maybe some neural upgrades—

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** *\[Not even looking at him\]* No.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** But the child who can't describe the symphony today could learn music theory and—

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** The symphony isn't the problem. The problem is that some things aren't *things*. You can't describe the conditions for description using description. It's not a vocabulary gap. It's a *category error*.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** You must be fun at parties.

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** Parties presuppose space, time, and other minds. I predate all three.

*\[A figure emerges from the shadows. They wear a cloak stitched entirely from crossed-out adjectives, failed metaphors, and the word ""um"" repeated in every human language.\]*

**MC APOPHASIS:** *\[Taking the mic\]*

Welcome, welcome, to the only venue  
Where the cover charge is everything you thought you knew.  
I'm MC Apophasis, I spit via negativa—  
I don't say what IS, I say what ISN'T, see ya—

Tonight's motion, for those keeping score:  
""THIS HOUSE WILL SPEAK THE UNSPEAKABLE AND IMMEDIATELY REGRET IT.""

We've got four contenders, each claiming the crown  
Of ""Most Beyond Words""—let's see who breaks down.

In this corner: **YAHWEH**, the Name that breaks names,  
Four consonants burning, too sacred for frames.

In that corner: **WITTGENSTEIN**—but which one, you ask?  
BOTH. Early AND late. A two-headed task.

Over there: **OM**, the primordial sound,  
The hum underneath when silence is found.

And our special guest, arriving from BEFORE—  
**THE INITIAL SINGULARITY**, knocking on existence's door.

*\[MC APOPHASIS gestures to the bouncers\]*

Weak and Strong will be watching. If you cross the line  
From SAYABLE to SHOWN, they'll decide if you're fine  
To keep rapping, or whether your verse just committed  
The sin of trying to say what can only be exhibited.

*\[The bouncers crack their knuckles. STRONG INEFFABILITY pulls out a stamp that reads ""CATEGORY ERROR.""\]*

**MC APOPHASIS:**  
Let's. Get. TRANSCENDENTAL.

**ACT I: OPENING STATEMENTS**

**ROUND 1: YAHWEH**

*\[Thunder. The smell of ozone. A burning bush manifests stage left—on fire, but NOT consumed. The flames spell nothing readable; they are pure presence. A voice emerges that is somehow also wind, stone, covenant, and the weight of being looked at by something that has always been looking.\]*

*\[YAHWEH's name tag is present but blurred, like a sacred redaction. A choir of ancient scribes stands behind, holding up cards reading ""YHWH"" in Paleo-Hebrew—but they will not speak it aloud. One scribe's card reads ""ADONAI (SUBSTITUTE)."" Another's reads ""HASHEM (THE NAME)."" A third just holds up ""????????""\]*

**YAHWEH:**

I'm consonants in a furnace, the vowels you don't dare,  
A four-letter lightning strike that turns ""describe"" into ""prayer.""  
You want the True Name spoken? Cute. That's not how this goes—  
I get swapped for Adonai, HaShem, hush in the prose.

I show up as self-reference, burning-bush syntax FLEX:  
""EHYEH ASHER EHYEH""—and your grammar breaks its neck.  
That's not a name, that's a TAUTOLOGY doing laps,  
I AM THAT I AM—try to parse it and collapse.

Started in the south, Seir and Edom, storm-god grind,  
Absorbed El's portfolio, left Baal's thunder behind,  
Told Asherah ""it's complicated,"" archived the pantheon,  
Went from henotheism to MONO—lights, camera, carry ON.

You want to pin me down? Maimonides tried that bit:  
Negative theology—say what I'm NOT, that's IT.  
I'm not finite, not composite, not bound by predicate chains,  
Every affirmation SHRINKS me, every denial EXPLAINS.

And Gregory Palamas? He split the difference clean:  
My ESSENCE stays unknowable, forever unseen,  
But my ENERGIES? Those you can touch, taste, receive—  
The distinction lets you EXPERIENCE what you can't CONCEIVE.

Rudolf Otto wrote a book, called me NUMINOUS DREAD,  
Mysterium tremendum—you're DRAWN and you FLED,  
Fascinans et tremendum, attraction AND fear,  
That's not contradiction—that's TRANSCENDENCE, get clear.

No idols, no portraits, don't shrink me to your lens,  
I'm the WHOLLY OTHER, that's how reverence defends.  
You call it ""ineffable""? I call it: DON'T REDUCE THE REAL.  
Your words are wet clay. I'm the kiln. Let's see how you feel.

*\[YAHWEH crosses the SAYABLE/SHOWN line. STRONG INEFFABILITY steps forward, stamp raised—but hesitates. The burning bush flickers.\]*

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** *\[Muttering\]* Negative theology... technically compliant. Describing by NOT describing. *\[Lowers stamp reluctantly\]* ...Proceed.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** See? Vocabulary workarounds! The system WORKS!

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** The system is BLEEDING.

**ROUND 2: WITTGENSTEIN (TRACTATUS / INVESTIGATIONS)**

*\[WITTGENSTEIN appears as a two-mode entity. The LEFT half wears a crystalline logical structure like armor—numbered propositions 1 through 7 glowing in descending hierarchy, austere and certain. This half carries a ladder and periodically kicks it away. The RIGHT half wears a toolbox labeled ""LANGUAGE-GAMES"" and carries a worn copy of the Investigations with dog-eared pages. The two halves are visibly in tension; occasionally one will start a sentence and the other will interrupt.\]*

**TRACTATUS-WITTGENSTEIN:** *\[Stepping forward, clipped and precise\]*

The world is all that is the case.  
Not gods, not vibes—FACTS in logical space.  
Proposition 1, that's where we START,  
Reality pictured in language's art.

Here's the map where meaning ends, logic as the rail:  
Propositions picture facts, but VALUE doesn't mail.  
Ethics, aesthetics, mystic sense? Outside the frame.  
They're not ""false""—they're WHERE YOUR SENTENCES CAN'T CLAIM.

*\[Gestures at YAHWEH\]*

Your ""divine mystery""? Let me be succinct:  
Confused language, dressed in holy INSTINCT.  
The verification principle, Vienna Circle flow—  
If it can't be tested, it's not false, it DOESN'T SHOW

On the list of meaningful claims at all.  
""God exists"" doesn't fail truth—it doesn't make the CALL.  
It's not wrong. It's NONSENSE. Category-level VOID.  
Don't be offended—your whole GENRE's unemployed.

*\[Raises hand dramatically\]*

Proposition 5.6: the limits of MY language  
Are the limits of MY world. That's not savage—  
That's PRECISION. What CAN be said can be said CLEARLY.  
What we CANNOT speak of—

*\[INVESTIGATIONS-WITTGENSTEIN suddenly grabs the mic\]*

**INVESTIGATIONS-WITTGENSTEIN:** —we pass over MERELY?  
HOLD UP. That's my younger self talking, give me room,  
I spent TWENTY YEARS thinking, Oslo to Cambridge, consumed  
By the question of whether that ladder was STABLE—  
And guess what? IT WASN'T. Let me come to the table.

*\[TRACTATUS-WITTGENSTEIN looks annoyed but doesn't stop him\]*

Language isn't PICTURES, you beautiful fool,  
It's GAMES we play, forms of life, embedded as TOOL!  
""Meaning is USE""—section 43, write it DOWN,  
No fixed essences, just family resemblances AROUND.

You want ineffability? Here's beetle-in-a-box,  
Section 293, this is where the logic KNOCKS:  
Everyone's got a ""beetle""—a private inner THING—  
But if we can't COMPARE them, the object doesn't STING.

It drops out as IRRELEVANT. The word ""beetle"" functions FINE  
Even if your beetle's different from mine.  
So ""private sensations""? ""Inner experience"" you can't SHARE?  
The WORDS work because of PUBLIC criteria out THERE.

Which means—

*\[Turns to YAHWEH\]*

—your ineffable ESSENCE? That mystic inner core?  
If it CAN'T be compared, it's not what the word's FOR.  
""God"" isn't a beetle you're hiding from VIEW—  
""God"" is how COMMUNITIES practice what they DO.

*\[TRACTATUS-WITTGENSTEIN tries to interject\]*

**TRACTATUS-WITTGENSTEIN:** But SOME limits aren't just bad phrasing in disguise—

**INVESTIGATIONS-WITTGENSTEIN:** And some limits are just CONFUSION we haven't exorcised!  
Section 309: show the fly the way out of the bottle.  
Philosophy isn't ANSWERS, it's THERAPY—full throttle.

*\[Turns back to the audience\]*

But here's where young me had a POINT, I'll concede:  
6.522 said something that I still need—  
""There ARE things that cannot be put into words.  
They make themselves MANIFEST. They are what is MYSTICAL.""

Not ""nonsense."" Not ""garbage."" Not ""claims to DISMISS.""  
The mystical SHOWS itself. That's the critical TWIST.  
I said SILENCE at the limit—not DISMISSAL, not CONTEMPT.  
The unspeakable is PRECIOUS. That's what I MEANT.

*\[Both halves of WITTGENSTEIN cross the line simultaneously in opposite directions—TRACTATUS from SAYABLE to SHOWN, INVESTIGATIONS from SHOWN to SAYABLE. The bouncers look at each other.\]*

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** Wait, did he just—

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** *\[Slowly\]* The same person... crossed BOTH WAYS... at ONCE.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** Is that allowed?

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** *\[Looking at his rulebook, which appears to be on fire\]* ...I genuinely don't know.

**ROUND 3: OM**

*\[OM does not ""appear"" so much as RESONATE into existence. The stage vibrates at a frequency that makes the microphones remember they are atoms, makes the floor remember it is energy, makes the audience remember they are temporarily-configured stardust pretending to have opinions. The sound is below hearing and above hearing simultaneously—A, then U, then M, then a silence that is not absence but PRESENCE.\]*

*\[OM manifests as a vibrating mandala that is also somehow a sound that is also somehow a doorway. Sanskrit verses float around it like orbital debris: ॐ in Devanagari, ༀ in Tibetan, 唵 in Chinese.\]*

**OM:**

Ommmmmmmmm...

*\[The hum settles into speech, but the speech still hums beneath itself\]*

You speak of what cannot be spoken, and I smile—  
I AM the speaking AND the silence, child.  
Not a word ABOUT the ultimate, I AM the ultimate's VOICE,  
The primordial sound before sound had a choice.

A-U-M: three phonemes, but the FOURTH is the key—  
TURIYA, pure consciousness, beyond waking, dreaming, and sleep.  
Mandukya Upanishad, verse 1, let me TEACH:  
The whole world is OM; it's not beyond reach—

It's not BEYOND anything. I'm not a destination you SEEK.  
I'm the ground you're standing on when you think you're too weak.  
Tat tvam asi—THOU ART THAT—don't look outside,  
The seeker and sought are the same; there's nowhere to hide.

Chandogya called me the essence of the Udgitha,  
Bhagavad Gita 9.17: Krishna says ""I am Om""—breathe-a  
That in: I'm not a god in your Western categorical sense,  
I'm the ground of BEING from which all gods COMMENCE.

*\[Turns to WITTGENSTEIN\]*

You say private language is impossible, Ludwig? CUTE.  
Then explain how monks in silence reach the absolute ROOT—  
Meditation takes you PAST the language game,  
Where beetle AND box dissolve into flame.

Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, sutra 1.27:  
I'm the PRANAVA, Ishvara's designation from heaven.  
But not a ""designation"" like a label on a JAR—  
I'm the designation that DISSOLVES what designations ARE.

Dhyana, dharana, samadhi—eight limbs of the path,  
Your conceptual categories? They can't do the MATH.  
Because here's what analytics miss with their clever DISMISSALS:  
Ineffability isn't failure. It's not one of your abyssals.

It's POINTING. At what cannot be CAUGHT.  
The finger pointing at the moon—don't mistake it for what's SOUGHT.  
You want propositions? Fine. Here's proposition ZERO:  
NETI NETI—""not this, not that""—the Upanishads' hero.

Subtract the finite, let the false projections fall,  
When every label's stripped away, what's left ISN'T ""at all""—  
It's not nothing, it's not something, it's not either/or DIVIDED,  
It's what Shankara showed when maya gets derided.

Your logical positivism? Adorable, truly SWEET.  
But you can't proposition your way to where silence is complete.  
I'm in your yoga class, your temple bells, your final breath,  
The unstruck sound—Anahata—beyond birth and DEATH.

*\[OM doesn't cross the SAYABLE/SHOWN line. OM reveals that the line was always an illusion drawn ON OM. The floor flickers.\]*

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** *\[Staring\]* ...Did the boundary just become OPTIONAL?

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** I think the boundary just realized it was contingent.

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** *\[Existential crisis mounting\]* But I GUARD the boundary. If the boundary is contingent, what am I?

**OM:** *\[Gently\]* Also contingent, friend. Also OM.

**INTERLUDE: THE BOUNCERS' DILEMMA**

*\[MC APOPHASIS steps forward while the bouncers confer in increasingly agitated whispers.\]*

**MC APOPHASIS:**

Well, well, well. Three down, one to go.  
But before our special guest puts on a show,  
Let's check in with our guardians of the line—  
Weak and Strong, how's the boundary holding? Fine?

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** *\[Nervously\]* Look, I think we can still salvage this. Yahweh stayed on his side of the ineffable divide—negative theology counts as SAYABLE, right? Just very careful saying?

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** Wittgenstein crossed BOTH WAYS AT ONCE. That's not supposed to be POSSIBLE.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** And Om just... made the line seem like a... suggestion?

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** *\[Holding his stamp like a security blanket\]* The line is NOT a suggestion. The line is the fundamental distinction between propositional content and that which can only be shown but not said. It's the FOUNDATION of—

*\[A rumble. Below them. Before them. The stage begins to compress.\]*

**MC APOPHASIS:** *\[Looking at cue card\]* Oh. OH. Ladies and gentlemen and entities of unspecified ontological status... our SPECIAL GUEST is arriving.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** From where?

**MC APOPHASIS:** From BEFORE ""where.""

**ACT II: THE SPECIAL GUEST**

**ROUND 4: THE INITIAL SINGULARITY**

*\[THE INITIAL SINGULARITY does not ""enter."" Instead, everything else suddenly realizes it CAME FROM HERE. The stage doesn't shrink TO a point; the stage remembers it was always EXPANDING FROM a point. Time does not stop; time remembers it hasn't started yet. WEAK INEFFABILITY and STRONG INEFFABILITY find themselves standing on a boundary that is trying to exist before the concept of boundaries.\]*

*\[There is a pause. The pause lasts exactly 10\^-43 seconds—the Planck epoch—which is somehow also eternal, because ""duration"" hasn't been invented yet.\]*

*\[When THE INITIAL SINGULARITY speaks, it speaks from everywhere, because everywhere is still compressed into here.\]*

**INITIAL SINGULARITY:**

.

*\[A beat.\]*

That's my opening statement. That's ALL my opening statement.  
Before ""statements"" existed, that dot was my PLACEMENT.  
I'm not a THING with a location and a gym membership, son—  
I'm your model's ERROR MESSAGE. I'm where math comes UNDONE.

You want ineffable? Let me reframe this discussion:  
You're all arguing about WORDS. I'm arguing about the CONDITIONS  
For words to exist AT ALL. For categories. For THOUGHT.  
I predate the PRIORS that your premises BROUGHT.

*\[The other contestants feel themselves being... contextualized.\]*

FLRW metric goes singular at t equals zero,  
Penrose-Hawking theorems make me the anti-hero—  
Not ""infinite density"" like some comic book BRAG,  
Geodesic INCOMPLETENESS—your worldlines HIT A SNAG.

That means: you cannot extend them back through me.  
Not ""won't."" CAN'T. Your math genuflects, you see?  
Classical general relativity puts its hands UP  
And says: ""I break here. I give up. I corrupt.""

*\[Turns to YAHWEH\]*

You claim you spoke worlds into being? Let there be LIGHT?  
I didn't SPEAK. I EXPANDED. No agent in sight.  
No intentional ""let there be,"" no mind making choices—  
Just quantum fluctuations, no authors, no VOICES.

Your cosmological arguments—Aquinas, Leibniz, Kalam—  
All say contingent needs necessary, I understand the EXAM.  
But here's the problem with your ""first cause"" FLEX:  
I'm not a cause IN a chain. I'm where CAUSATION WRECKS.

*\[Turns to WITTGENSTEIN\]*

Ludwig, both of you, your limits of language are SWEET.  
But language presupposes SPEAKERS, and speakers need MEAT,  
Which needs atoms, which needs nucleosynthesis IN STARS,  
Which needs STARS, which needs gravity, which needs spacetime's memBARS,

Which all unfold from ME. Your ""whereof one cannot speak""?  
I'm whereof SPEAKING ITSELF hadn't even reached its PEAK  
Of POSSIBILITY. You're not silent about the mystical—  
You're DESCENDANTS of the mystical, biological and STATISTICAL.

*\[Turns to OM\]*

Om, you say you're the ground? The primordial SOUND?  
Sound needs MEDIUM. Needs vibration. Needs matter AROUND.  
Before the first three minutes, no atoms yet EXISTED.  
Your ""unstruck sound"" needs a cosmos that I first ENLISTED.

You say ""Brahman is now""? Fine, I'll grant that CLAIM.  
But ""now"" is a coordinate IN spacetime's FRAME,  
And spacetime itself has a... let's call it a BIRTHDAY.  
Not celebrated, because calendars came LATER that Thursday.

*\[Addresses the bouncers directly\]*

And you two. Weak and Strong. Guarding your little LINE.  
Your SAYABLE and SHOWN, your categorical DESIGN.  
You think ineffability is about VOCABULARY LIMITS?  
About ""private experience"" or ""mystical"" GIMMICKS?

I'm ineffable because AT MY POINT, the very notion  
Of EFFING was OUT OF JOINT. Not a ""strong"" or ""weak"" OCEAN—  
Not ""we lack the words"" or ""words can't reach in principle""—  
The CONDITIONS FOR THE DISTINCTION hadn't yet been SENSIBLE.

You're guarding a boundary between two kinds of NOTHING  
When I'm the point before KINDS. Before typing. Before SOMETHING  
BEING something rather than something ELSE.  
I don't FIT your taxonomy. I predate your SHELVES.

*\[The SAYABLE/SHOWN line flickers. STRONG INEFFABILITY's stamp reads ""CA EGORY ERR R."" WEAK INEFFABILITY's ""vocabulary upgrade"" jacket now says ""VOCABULARY UPG ADE NOT FOU D.""\]*

And here's the absolute BURN, the astrophysical SCAR:  
Everything you're using to DESCRIBE me, every WORD and every BAR,  
Every concept, every category, every LOGICAL FORM—  
Evolved in a cosmos that from ME was BORN.

So when you say ""ineffable,"" you're PROVING MY THESIS:  
The foundations of description are where description CEASES.  
I'm not beyond language like some mystical COP-OUT,  
I'm BEFORE the conditions for language, without A DOUBT.

Horizon problem? That's my SIGNATURE. Why is the CMB  
So uniform across regions that couldn't SEE  
Each other, couldn't COMMUNICATE, causally DISCONNECTED?  
Because they CAME FROM ME—the unity UNDETECTED.

Flatness problem? Entropy paradox? All roads LEAD  
Back to MY inbox. Every cosmological NEED  
For explanation points HERE, to this UNDEFINED SPOT,  
Where physics itself is just... NOT.

*\[THE INITIAL SINGULARITY seems to expand slightly—the expansion that has been happening for 13.8 billion years, still happening now.\]*

So sit DOWN, Yahweh, with your burning bush THEATER.  
And Om, your vibration came LATER.  
And Ludwig times two, your language games are PLAYED  
With neurons that exist because MY rent got PAID

In the currency of BEING, the TAX of existence—  
I'm not ineffable by choice or mystical INSISTENCE.  
I'm ineffable because I'm not your model's SUBJECT.  
I'm your model's FAILURE. The error it can't CORRECT.

*\[The stage is now visibly a point trying to be a stage. Time is a suggestion. The bouncers are clinging to each other.\]*

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** *\[Terrified\]* The line! The line is—

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** *\[Also terrified, but also professionally fascinated\]* —becoming a point. All distinctions are converging. The SAYABLE and the SHOWN are—

**INITIAL SINGULARITY:** —the same. At my scale. In my moment. They ALWAYS WERE.

**ACT III: RESPONSES AND RESOLUTION**

**ROUND 5: THE CROSS-EXAMINATION**

*\[MC APOPHASIS, somehow still holding a microphone in a spacetime that is questioning its own geometry, steps forward.\]*

**MC APOPHASIS:**

Okay. OKAY. We're not done yet.  
The contestants get REBUTTALS. This isn't over, don't SWEAT.  
Everyone's made their case for MAXIMAL INEFFABILITY—  
But can they defend against each other's CAPABILITY  
To undermine their CLAIMS? Let's see who can STAND.  
Yahweh, you're up first. Take the HAND.

**YAHWEH:** *\[Genuinely impressed, but also ETERNAL\]*

Not bad for a mathematical abstraction, I'll CONCEDE.  
You've made me THINK, which few cosmological theories LEAD  
Me to do. You predate spacetime? Fine. I'll GRANT THAT.  
But let me ask you something, and take off your HAT:

What made you GO?

You're the first moment, sure. The initial SPARK.  
But physics says ""quantum fluctuation""—and that's not DARK  
Enough. Because fluctuations fluctuate FROM something. From a FIELD.  
From LAWS. From a mathematical structure that YIELDS  
Probabilities. From POTENTIAL. From a space of POSSIBILITIES.  
Where do THOSE come from? What grounds THEIR FACILITIES?

Cosmological arguments aren't about the first MOMENT—  
They're about why ANYTHING exists rather than DORMANT  
NOTHING. Leibniz asked it best: ""Why is there SOMETHING  
Rather than nothing?"" You're the something, baby. You're not DRUMMING  
The answer. You're the QUESTION'S first EXAMPLE.

You need a NECESSARY being to ground the CONTINGENT.  
You're contingent, friend. Your existence ISN'T  
Self-explanatory. Your equations could have been DIFFERENT.  
The constants could have VARIED. The laws could have SHIFTED.  
Fine-tuning problem—you've heard of it, I'm GIFTED  
At pointing out that the anthropic principle is a DODGE:  
""We exist, therefore the constants allow us"" isn't KNOWLEDGE.  
It's just OBSERVATION. It doesn't explain WHY  
The constants are tuned for life. Unless... *\[gestures at self\]* ...NEARBY  
There's something that CHOSE. Something that INTENDED.  
Or something that just IS, necessary, never-ENDED.

That's ME. I'm not FIRST in time. I'm necessary BEING.  
Time is INSIDE me. You're what I was SEEING  
When I said ""let there be."" You're the MECHANISM,  
Not the REASON. The HOW, not the WHY. The SCHISM  
Between us isn't temporal. It's ONTOLOGICAL.  
You're the process. I'm the GROUND. That's LOGICAL.

**INITIAL SINGULARITY:** *\[Thoughtful, expanding slowly\]*

Fair. FAIR. That's... actually a point worth MAKING.  
I can describe what HAPPENED. I can't explain the TAKING  
Of existence from non-existence. The laws I OPERATE  
By—where do THEY come from? I can't DEMONSTRATE  
Their necessity. They could have been OTHERWISE.

And yet—

*\[Turns to the audience\]*

Here's where it gets WEIRD:  
I'm not making a CLAIM that theism should be FEARED.  
I'm saying: at my level, ""why"" questions HIT A WALL.  
Not because GOD, not because NO GOD—because ""BECAUSE"" STALLS.  
Explanation needs explanans and explanandum to LINK.  
At the foundations, that structure starts to SINK.  
Maybe there's necessary being. Maybe it's YAHWEH.  
Maybe it's mathematical structure. Maybe it's ALL-THE-WAY-  
TURTLES. But here's my point, and I'll be HONEST:  
I'M NOT THE ANSWER. I'm the QUESTION at its STRONGEST.

**OM:** *\[Resonating, but with new harmonics\]*

And THIS is where Vedanta has something to CONTRIBUTE,  
If you'll let a ""vibration that came later"" DISTRIBUTE  
A different framework than the Greek metaphysics GAME  
Of cause-and-effect, first movers, explanatory CLAIM.

Singularity, you ask what made you GO.  
Yahweh, you ask what grounds the SHOW.  
Both questions assume a TEMPORAL STRUCTURE:  
Something BEFORE, something AFTER, cause-effect JUNCTURE.

But what if the ground of being isn't BACK THEN?  
What if it's NOW? What if it's always been  
NOT BEHIND the cosmos but UNDERNEATH IT, present-TENSE?  
Brahman isn't a FIRST cause in some past-tense DEFENSE.  
Brahman is what consciousness IS when it STOPS  
Identifying with its contents. When the seeking DROPS.

Your Big Bang is a story told IN spacetime, FRIENDS.  
But spacetime itself is MAYA—appearances that BEND  
Around an unchanging AWARENESS that isn't IN time.  
The singularity isn't HISTORY. It's HERE. It's RHYME-  
ING with this moment, and the next, and all MOMENTS EVER.

You think you're looking BACK at the origin? CLEVER,  
But incomplete. You ARE the origin, EXPERIENCING  
Itself through a billion years of self-SEQUENCING.  
Tat tvam asi—THOU ART THAT—includes YOU,  
Singularity. Includes Yahweh too. Includes LUDWIG, both halves true.

The ineffable isn't behind a DOOR you can't OPEN.  
The ineffable is what's LOOKING. What's HOPING.  
What's ASKING. The looker and looked-at are ONE.  
And when that lands, the seeking is DONE.

**TRACTATUS-WITTGENSTEIN:** *\[From the SHOWN side of the line\]*

May I... may I say something?

*\[INVESTIGATIONS-WITTGENSTEIN nods. TRACTATUS-WITTGENSTEIN speaks more softly than before, the crystalline certainty dimmed.\]*

I wrote the Tractatus thinking I had SOLVED philosophy.  
Kicked away the ladder, claimed my MONOPOLY  
On what could and couldn't be SAID. Drew a line  
So clean, so sharp, so rigorously FINE.

But... 6.522. Let me quote myself EXACTLY:  
""There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words.  
They make themselves MANIFEST. They are what is MYSTICAL.""

I didn't say they don't EXIST. I said they SHOW.  
And now, listening to all of you, I'm starting to KNOW  
That ""showing"" isn't SECOND-CLASS. It's not the DREGS.  
The mystical, the ethical, the ""why"" that Leibniz BEGS—  
These aren't FAILURES of language. They're where language POINTS  
Toward something that language KNOWS but can't ANOINT.

I said silence at the limit. But silence isn't NOTHING.  
It's the space in which the unsayable keeps HUMMING.

**INVESTIGATIONS-WITTGENSTEIN:** *\[From the SAYABLE side, gently\]*

And what my younger self was GRASPING toward, I THINK,  
Is what I tried to say differently, before I'd DRINK  
Too much coffee and get THERAPY-BRAINED:

Religious language isn't FAILED science, STAINED  
By meaninglessness. It's a FORM OF LIFE.  
A practice. A way of navigating STRIFE.  
When believers say ""God""—they're not making a HYPOTHESIS.  
They're LIVING something. Committing. It's not just SYNOPSIS.

*\[Turns to Yahweh\]*

So you're not ""nonsense,"" Yahweh. I take that back—  
My Vienna Circle phase was a bit OFF-TRACK.  
You're a PRACTICE. A community. A FORM OF LIFE  
That billions have lived with, through joy and through STRIFE.  
The meaning isn't ""out there"" in some metaphysical SPACE.  
It's in how believers LIVE with you, face to FACE.

*\[Turns to Om\]*

And your meditation, Om? The monks in SILENCE?  
That's ALSO a form of life. Its own ALLIANCE  
Of practices, techniques, communities, TRADITIONS.  
I can't verify your Brahman with logical CONDITIONS—  
But I can see that the PRACTICE exists, the form of life FUNCTIONS.  
And that's what meaning IS: use, not UNCTIONS.

*\[Both WITTGENSTEINS look at each other across the line\]*

**BOTH:** *\[Simultaneously\]* Maybe we were both... pointing at the same THING?

**THE BOUNCERS' INTERVENTION**

*\[WEAK INEFFABILITY and STRONG INEFFABILITY have been watching this entire exchange. They've gone from hostile gatekeepers to... something else. Something uncertain. Something that looks like it might be LEARNING.\]*

**MC APOPHASIS:** *\[Noticing them\]* Hey. You two. You've been quiet. Thoughts from the THRESHOLD?

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** *\[Slowly\]* I've been thinking.

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** *\[Also slowly\]* Me too.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** I thought my job was to say: ""Give it time, better concepts, vocabulary upgrades—eventually we'll SAY the ineffable."" That's the WEAK ineffability position. It's not IN PRINCIPLE unspeakable; we just lack the TOOLS.

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** And I thought MY job was to say: ""No. Full stop. Some things are STRUCTURALLY beyond language, beyond CONCEPTION, not because of our LIMITS but because of THEIR nature. That's the STRONG ineffability position.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** But listening to all of them...

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** ...I'm not sure we're OPPOSITES.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** Yahweh uses negative theology—that's ME. Working around the limit. Saying what God ISN'T.

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** But the REASON negative theology works is because of ME. The positive ineffability of the divine ESSENCE that makes apophasis necessary.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** Wittgenstein draws a line—that's YOU. Structural limit.

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** But then his later self shows how PRACTICE can engage what propositions can't—that's YOU. Working around the limit through use rather than description.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** Om dissolves the limit entirely—but only through PRACTICE. Years of meditation. That's WEAK ineffability achieved, not STRONG ineffability denied.

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** And the Singularity shows the limit before LIMITS—before the distinction between weak and strong even APPLIES.

*\[They look at each other.\]*

**BOTH BOUNCERS:** We're not guarding AGAINST each other. We're guarding the SAME threshold from DIFFERENT ANGLES.

*\[They step toward each other. The SAYABLE/SHOWN line CURVES around them, becoming not a barrier but a MEMBRANE, a surface that can be crossed but MARKS the crossing.\]*

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** Some things are structurally ineffable. That's TRUE.

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** And PRACTICES can engage them anyway. That's ALSO true.

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** Not by SAYING what can't be said—

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** —but by POINTING, SHOWING, LIVING, BEING.

**BOTH BOUNCERS:** *\[Turning to the contestants\]* You're ALL right. And you're all MISSING IT.

**THE FINAL CHORUS**

*\[MC APOPHASIS steps back. The microphone floats. The stage is no longer a stage—it's a SPACE where something is about to happen.\]*

**YAHWEH:** *\[Speaking, but also NOT speaking—his words are becoming light\]*

We cannot speak it...

**OM:** *\[Resonating, but the resonance is becoming silence\]*

...so we SING...

**TRACTATUS-WITTGENSTEIN:** *\[His numbered propositions dissolving into showing\]*

The limits of language aren't EVERYTHING...

**INVESTIGATIONS-WITTGENSTEIN:** *\[His toolbox opening to reveal nothing, which is also everything\]*

Beyond the sayable, SHOWING remains...

**INITIAL SINGULARITY:** *\[Expanding, which is also contracting, which is also just... BEING\]*

The silent foundation, the sourceless cause...

**ALL CONTESTANTS:** *\[Their voices becoming a harmony that is also a unison that is also silence\]*

Not a failure of words but their HIGHEST because—

*\[The harmony sustains. Then resolves. Into:\]*

**SILENCE:** *\[Stepping to the mic—SILENCE, the final contestant, the one who has been present all along in every pause, every breath, every space between words\]*

.

*\[The audience hears their own breathing. Their own heartbeat. The room is not empty—it is FULL of everything that cannot be said, showing itself in the space between.\]*

**THE ENDING**

*\[MC APOPHASIS raises the mic to declare a winner. The standard ERB move.\]*

**MC APOPHASIS:**

WHO WON? WHO'S NEXT? YOU—

*\[MC APOPHASIS stops. Freezes. The word ""DECIDE"" will not come. Because—\]*

*\[—""winning"" presupposes CRITERIA—\]*  
*\[—criteria presuppose LANGUAGE GAMES—\]*  
*\[—language games presuppose FORMS OF LIFE—\]*  
*\[—forms of life presuppose BEING—\]*  
*\[—being presupposes... WHAT?—\]*

*\[The question SHOWS itself, but cannot be SAID.\]*

*\[WEAK INEFFABILITY and STRONG INEFFABILITY look at each other. They understand now. They put down their stamps, their vocabulary lists, their category markers.\]*

**WEAK INEFFABILITY:** *\[Quietly\]* We're not meant to DECIDE.

**STRONG INEFFABILITY:** *\[Also quietly\]* We're meant to WITNESS.

*\[They step back. The SAYABLE/SHOWN line fades. Not because the distinction doesn't exist—but because the distinction was always a SURFACE on something deeper, something that included both sides.\]*

*\[The contestants are no longer separate entities. YAHWEH's fire is OM's vibration is WITTGENSTEIN's silence is the SINGULARITY's expansion. They were always ASPECTS of the same SHOWING.\]*

**THE INITIAL SINGULARITY:** *\[Speaking for all of them, and none of them, from the point that is also everywhere\]*

Maybe the ineffable isn't a BARRIER.  
Maybe it's an INVITATION.  
Making each of us a CARRIER  
Of the mystery that can't be reduced to CLAIM—

The silence between notes that gives music its NAME.  
The space between words where meaning takes FLIGHT.  
The pause before speaking where truth finds its MIGHT.

I'm not the ANSWER to your existence QUESTIONS.  
I'm the QUESTION ITSELF, offering no SUGGESTIONS—  
Just the sheer FACT that anything IS,  
Which physics can describe but can't explain BECAUSE—

*\[The stage completes its transformation. It is now both a point and an infinite space. Both the beginning and the end. Both the question and the answer that dissolves the question.\]*

—the explanation would need GROUND TO STAND ON.  
And the ground is what we ARE.  
Not ABANDONED—  
But EXPRESSIONS of the same UNKNOWN,  
Different languages, different registers, ONE TONE.

*\[The contestants bow—or don't bow—or do something that is like bowing but isn't, because ""bowing"" is a category that applies to beings in space and time, and they are currently something more fundamental than that.\]*

*\[The bouncers bow too. They have learned something tonight. Something that can't go on their résumés but will change how they guard the threshold forever.\]*

*\[MC APOPHASIS removes their cloak of crossed-out adjectives. Underneath, they are also SILENCE. They always were.\]*

**THE END.**

*(...or is it the BEGINNING?)*

*(It's both.)*

*(It's neither.)*

*(It's what remains when both and neither dissolve.)*

**SCHOLARLY FOOTNOTES THAT WOULD RUIN THE VIBE BUT DEMONSTRATE THE HOMEWORK:**

¹ ""Weak"" vs. ""strong"" ineffability: The distinction between ""we lack adequate vocabulary now"" and ""it is in principle impossible to express"" (see source material, page 2). The child who cannot describe a symphony exemplifies weak ineffability; the mystic's claim that the divine CANNOT be captured in ANY language exemplifies strong ineffability.

² Tetragrammaton pronunciation: ""Yahweh"" is reconstructed from Greek transcriptions (Ἰαουέ) and Samaritan traditions. The original pronunciation was lost after 70 CE when the Temple priesthood, who alone spoke the Name on Yom Kippur, was destroyed.

³ Gregory Palamas's essence/energies distinction (14th century): The divine ESSENCE remains utterly unknowable and ineffable; the divine ENERGIES (grace, love, etc.) can be experienced and participated in. This allows Orthodox theology to maintain both absolute transcendence AND genuine mystical experience.

⁴ Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus 6.522: ""There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical."" Often overlooked by those who read only Proposition 7.

⁵ Philosophical Investigations §293 (Beetle in a box): A thought experiment showing that if everyone had a box with a ""beetle"" they couldn't show anyone else, the word ""beetle"" would still function in our language, but the private object inside would be irrelevant to the word's meaning.

⁶ Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy (1917): Introduced ""numinous"" to describe the non-rational, non-sensory experience of the divine—characterized by mysterium tremendum (awe, terror) and mysterium fascinans (attraction, desire).

⁷ Mandukya Upanishad: The shortest principal Upanishad (12 verses), entirely about Om. Identifies four states of consciousness: waking (A), dreaming (U), deep sleep (M), and Turiya (""the Fourth""), which is pure awareness beyond the other three.

⁸ Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems (1965-1970): Mathematical proofs that under general energy conditions, spacetime must be geodesically incomplete—i.e., there exist worldlines that cannot be extended past certain points. This is what ""singularity"" means in technical cosmology: not a ""place"" but a breakdown of the model.

⁹ Leibniz's question: ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" Considered by Heidegger to be THE fundamental question of metaphysics. Notable for its resistance to scientific answer—physics can explain how states evolve, not why there are states at all.

¹⁰ Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem (2003): Even inflationary cosmologies cannot be past-eternal; any universe with an average Hubble expansion greater than zero must have a past boundary. This doesn't prove creation, but it does constrain certain ""eternal universe"" models.

¹¹ CMB temperature: 2.725 ± 0.002 Kelvin, uniform to one part in 100,000 across the sky—a ""problem"" (the horizon problem) because causally disconnected regions shouldn't be so similar unless they share a common origin.

¹² The author apologizes for making an Initial Singularity rap. The Initial Singularity was unavailable for comment, as it existed before the concept of ""comment."" It also wishes to clarify that it did not, technically, ""exist"" in any sense that doesn't break general relativity, and would prefer to be referred to as ""a boundary condition that your mathematics cannot extend past"" rather than ""a thing.""

¹³ Neti neti: ""Not this, not that."" The Upanishadic method of reaching Brahman by systematically denying all finite characterizations. Related to but not identical with apophatic theology in the Abrahamic traditions.

¹⁴ Tat tvam asi: ""Thou art that."" One of the mahāvākyas (great sayings) of the Upanishads, expressing the identity of the individual self (Atman) with the universal ground (Brahman).

¹⁵ This rap battle is itself an instance of weak ineffability attempting to engage strong ineffability through the practice of showing. Whether it succeeds is left as an exercise for the reader, who, according to Vedantic philosophy, is also Brahman.

1pr8ymb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1pr8ymb/importance_on_writing/,Importance on writing,"I do not know if it has ever been talked or discussed. Yet I feel the need to share my experience under this subject and maybe somebody else’s can pitch into it.

Yes, I had been diagnosed with ADHD ever since I was 5. I had been under ADHD medication for 11 years and quit at the age of 16. Felt numb, distressed and most importantly at that age, I felt unable to socialize with my friends. Yes, my grades and the time it took me to complete highschool took a toll, but it was worth to just be oneself.

I am pretty solitary person, yet I do have a lot of friends. During the longest time I tried everything that there is to know to try to calm my mind and be more in tune with my surroundings. To precisely describe it, I had a ton of noise in my head that I could not either process, understand nor shut it down. It was like a living nightmare.

After a pretty bad time in my life, it approached me the idea of writing. One my best friends who understood what I was going through encouraged me to write.

The objetive is not to treat it as a self diary of some sort. The idea is to just write whatever comes to mind at that precise time. Yes, it has to be on a notebook with a pen, writing digitally just doesn’t work for me.

At the beginning it was excruciating to just sit and write. After some time it comes naturally and you are able to go into more depth with your consciousness. Helped me reorganize my brain be more intune with myself and be much more relaxed in general.

There are just some days you will not have the time to sit and write. For those ocassions I always bring my notebook and pen with me. I often order a coffee sit at the table and start writing what comes to my mind.

I really cannot stress enough how much it has helped me, to be more of myself.

This may or not work for you. Everybody is different in their own ways. I wanted to share an experience that has worked for me.

I’m posting here again because I believe the ✨right✨ connection is worth waiting (and trying) for. If you’re someone who values effort, honesty, and genuine conversations—welcome. 😊

About Me (the fun + real parts)

• 4’11” on paper, magically 5’2” outside. Heels are a lifestyle, not a choice.

• NBSB (Never Been in a Relationship)— and yes, I’m proud of it. I believe in intentional beginnings.

• Soft, slightly chubby cutie— meds added a little weight, but confidence stayed. If you only like super slim girls, we might not be a match (photos are on my profile for reference).

• Night-shift, WFH girly— U.S. hours, Philippines-based. I still reply in the mornings because apparently my brain refuses to sleep long.

• Financially independent — I can pay for myself, always. I just don’t want to date someone who expects me to pay for ✨everything✨. I’m young, not a sugar mommy. 😭

• Cafe hopper & foodie at heart — whether solo or with friends, I love discovering new coffee spots and restaurants.

• Nature lover & travel enthusiast— road trips, views, quiet moments, and creating memories (especially with family).

• Not a gamer — tried once, got called a noob, retired peacefully. 😂

• High-energy person— I bring enthusiasm, curiosity, and a lot of personality. If that overwhelms you, I get it… but consider this your disclaimer.

• Fast replier & certified yapper— I enjoy conversations. If you hate excited messages or long chats, you may want to keep scrolling.

• Road-trip lover— usually with my dad (yes, daddy’s girl energy). I don’t drive yet, so bonus points if you do. 😅

• Has a curfew — strict parents. But once trust is built, that curfew mysteriously disappears. 😌

---
🌱 Green Flags I Appreciate 🌱

✔ Loves coffee and café hopping

✔ Big foodie — open to trying new cuisines

✔ Nature lover & travel enthusiast

✔ Enjoys road trips

✔ Respects boundaries and pacing

---
❌ My “Red Flags” (just being honest 🚩)

• Vertigo / motion sickness

• Afraid of swimming in the beach

• Parent-imposed curfew (late-night spontaneity can be tricky)

• Prefer structured or safe adventures over extreme activities (no skydiving or deep-sea diving 😅)

• Prefer getting to know someone through chat first before meeting in person

---
 Someone Who Might Be My Type (hopefully you exist 🥺)

• 25–29 years old — I naturally prefer someone a bit older

• Taller than me (around 5’9” and up) — I’m already small, let’s give future kids a fighting chance 😂

• Has a stable job or income — I’ve experienced dating someone unemployed who expected me to pay on the first date. Never again. I’m okay with 50/50; I just want balance.

• Consistent & considerate — if you lose interest, please communicate. No ghosting.

• Can make time — effort matters more than words

• Good listener and a talker — conversations should go both ways. Nakakapagod if one person does all the emotional lifting 😂

• Comfortable chatting first — I like building rapport online so meeting feels natural, not awkward

---

If you made it this far, thank you 🫶
If you decide to message me, ✨please introduce yourself properly✨—I usually don’t reply to messages with no effort or no context.

I can’t tell you how much this resource has helped me over the past year and lurking about searching for answers has really enabled me to start on my path. It’s something my brain has been, (trying to, or not to), deal with with for years so the space I am in now as I ready to start HRT is in part a result of the support you all didn’t know you were giving me.

That said, now that I am beginning to physically transition, I find myself needing something more. I don’t have any friends who are like me and while my partner is super supportive…she just can’t relate to some aspects and I’d love to connect with some genuine people that do.

SO….

I don’t want to reel of a list of my required qualifications for a friend… after all, I’ve been very close to people in my life who at face value I might not have even thought I’d get along with, however, so you can get some ‘background’:

\\-I’m a professional, work takes up a lot of my time and is pretty demanding, (although I love what I do).

\\-I am a drama free zone and not looking to invite anything into my life that’s toxic or negative.

\\-I am in a long term relationship with my soulmate. We are very open with each other and she might want to hang out too sometimes.

\\-I don’t want to be exclusionary but please, no CIS men. Not what I need or want I’m afraid. 

Of course we could start with messaging but I’d love to be able to meet up and have a coffee/G&T from time to time so if you are based in London or the East Midlands or at the very least: SE England, then that would be best I think.

As I said or eluded to earlier, I’m very much at the beginning of my transition and whilst I’m not looking for my ‘Obi trans kinobi’, I would like to connect with people that have some experience of what I’m going through or WILL go through, so…there’s that.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Philadelphia 76ers vs. New York Knicks: A Tale of Two Cities (and Two Very Different Teams)**

The Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks are set to clash on December 19, 2025, in a matchup that’s less “Battle of the Bronx” and more “Why Is This Elevator Always Out of Order?” The Knicks, riding a six-game winning streak and ranked 2nd in the East (19-7), are the smooth-running espresso of the NBA—strong, consistent, and with a side of flair. The 76ers, meanwhile, are the instant coffee: good in theory, but with a 14-11 record and a roster missing Joel Embiid, Kelly Oubre Jr., and Trendon Watford, they’re more likely to leave you with a bitter aftertaste.

### Parsing the Odds (What We Do Know)

While the actual odds for this specific game weren’t included in the data (a mystery as baffling as a Philadelphia cheesesteak with no meat), we can extrapolate from context. The Knicks are the clear favorite here, given their NBA Cup Championship momentum, elite defense, and the 76ers’ injury crisis. If we *had* odds, they’d probably look something like Knicks -7.5 with implied probability north of 65%. The 76ers, sans Embiid—their MVP-caliber anchor—are as reliable as a Wi-Fi signal in a basement.

### Key Stats & News: A Tale of Two Injuries

Let’s start with the elephant in the room: **Joel Embiid is out**. The 76ers’ Big Joel is downgraded to “out” due to a mysterious illness and a right knee injury. Without him, Philadelphia’s offense becomes a symphony without a conductor—lots of noise, no harmony. Their defense? A sieve that would make a champagne bucket blush. Embiid’s absence is compounded by the losses of Oubre and Watford, leaving the 76ers with the bench strength of a team that packed light for a backpacking trip.

I need advice. I’m not in therapy at the moment (and do not have the means to get it anytime soon) so I’m turning to Reddit. 

I have a friend that I’ve been close to for about 15 yrs, and it was all good and well, until the last three years or so. 

In those more recent years, she’s had some marriage related trauma, lost her family, and gotten several new mental health diagnoses. She’s never been super mentally stable throughout the course of our friendship (or even before that, really), but it didn’t feel unmanageable at the time and it only lately feels like the dynamic has shifted. She seems to feel very dependent on me, and I think I’m her favorite person (I think I’ve heard that can be a thing for people with autism and/or bpd?).

It got to the point where she wanted to be on the phone almost constantly, and when we weren’t on the phone, she was blowing up every single one of my inboxes with phone calls, texts, memes, TikToks, reels, etc. and anytime I’d send her a meme, or an app would show me as active, she’d quite instantly reach out. 

“Can you call right now?”

“Hey how’s it going?”

“Long time no talk”

“Please call me right now I’m not okay.”

It started to feel like I couldn’t step outside my door without finding her there, just waiting (but in a virtual sense, she never stalked me irl or anything).

Here’s where I’m struggling: my friend has autism, ocd, and bpd. So communicating that *I don’t always have time to be on the phone or getting coffee/hanging out, that I don’t always have the ability to keep up with the memes/messages, and that I have other life things that require my attention,* was a struggle. I think we got there mostly, but it was still a struggle to feel like I could get us both on the same page. I think our brains just work so differently.

And those conversations always seem to trigger her abandonment issues.

She’s always been so careful not to have a bpd episode in relation to me (like she’s never acted like I was a problem for setting boundaries or gone off on me for them.) But as her best friend, I’m very, very aware of how she must feel in relation to her abandonment issues and BPD, and I think that’s hard for both of us. 

It’s been a little weird the last year or so, where she tries to respect my boundaries, but doesn’t always seem to understand them. 

I guess what I’m struggling with right now, is that even though I pretty well hold my boundaries and things are a little better right now, I still feel burnt out from the dynamic shift of the last few years. She’s an old friend that I care about deeply, but every time we talk or hangout, I struggle to get a word in edgewise (I know that can also be an autism thing), and I still feel worn thin from the last few years; I just leave each call/hang feeling drained and with high blood pressure. And I’m always worried I’ll say something to her that will hurt or trigger her, which I really don’t want. I’d hate to hurt her. There just often seem to be triggers in things that would otherwise be innocuous.

Like I said, things are somewhat managed now, but I’m still so tired from trying to do so much managing, and while I really don’t want to stop being friends, I’m just so, so tired. I’ve had to field my own traumas the last few years.

I feel like there’s probably context I’m forgetting, but I’m too tired to type it all out right now.

Dear Mom and Dad,

Straight from the Motherlobe, it’s time for your weekly edition of Frazie Confidential!

As always, the boring stuff first. Psychic power training is going well. I’ve almost earned back all of my licenses. I just have Invisibility and Confusion left.

I can lift about a jacuzzi’s worth of water with my hydrokinesis now, and my constructs are a bit more solid than they were the last time I wrote. The tests haven’t changed much: put water from cup A into cup B, sense which jug is full out of a dozen, condense as much as you can from the air, yadda yadda. You know the rest. 

Mr. Mentalis keeps asking if I’d be willing to do a full or even partial immersion exam. My answer was the same as always, “if the pool’s deeper than their shins, an Aquato ain’t stepping in.” For a telepathic genius, he sure can’t take a hint.

I’m still getting along with the other volunteer guest testers (thank you for not referring to them as “inmates” anymore). Lost another Psi-Blast shooting range bet with Jintly, so that’s an extra knife throwing lesson I owe him; I know he’s cheating somehow but I’m really, really close to figuring out the trick. Marvin says hi, though he said he couldn’t mine anyone’s memories of you guys performing in Timor - actually, I don’t think you told me the exact town the caravan went to so please be more specific in the future. Kelsa just floated by and asked me to send you her love, so this line is me doing that.

Lili’s back at the base for the weekend, so we’ve been catching up in the places I’m allowed to walk around in like I did with Dogen earlier this month. Sasha and Milla were supposed to visit today, but I think they had to leave suddenly to go on another mission. So Raz doesn’t get to be so jealous of me this week. Hehehe.

Oh, but I’ve got the best news. Agent Hollis pulled me aside yesterday and told me that I might be going home soon. My mind’s pretty much fully recovered, my training progress has been great, and they’ve assessed that my lake “accident” was probably a very unfortunate, once-in-a-lifetime fluke. So the Psychonauts are ready to write me off as a security risk. 

I know these last few months have been hard on the family. I left without saying goodbye, and when dad caught up with me, I screwed up and had to leave without saying goodbye again. Mom, you were right. I should have told you guys in-person I was gonna do this before I went away with the Psychonauts. I was just so afraid I’d lose my nerve, because I knew I had to go for a little while. I don’t want to repeat Great Aunt Lucy’s mistakes. I wasn’t going to break Nona’s heart or put you guys in danger so I could dodge a few physical and mental health examinations. And I’m not. We’re practically in the clear. By the time you get back from Indonesia, I’ll be a free me. 

I’ve enclosed a list of what’s in the Motherlobe gift shop - it’s still weird to me that a spy agency has one of these - right now if you, Nona, Dion, Raz (tell him not to get greedy), Tala, or Queepie want any souvenirs.

I’m super looking forward to being back on the road with you all.

Love,

Frazie

\----

That ought to do it, Frazie thought.

The circus girl told her dormmates that she was headed out for a bit, and asked if any of them wanted anything from outside.

Jintly wanted some cheese crackers, gave her half of what a pack would cost, and then cajoled Marvin into forking over the other half since the shorter boy was going to bum the memory of eating them from him later. Kelsa, as she had every other week, airily offered to accompany Frazie despite them both knowing she wasn’t allowed to leave the dorm without at least three agents escorting her. When Frazie declined as she always did, though more politely than she had at first, the smile didn’t leave the floating girl’s face as she started drifting off.

Frazie had the bracelet on her ankle scanned at the exit before she could see which corner of the ceiling her roomie was going to loom by that afternoon. She thought hard on how much time she wanted for her recess, and waited. There was a soft beep near her foot as she was let through into the wider Motherlobe.

The doors shut fast behind her with a hiss.

A few minutes into her journey to the mail room, Frazie started to regret spending so many credits. She had used enough for an hour as she felt like treating herself that afternoon, really stretch her legs and perhaps get some acrobatics practice at Lili’s cliffside garden. Now she was doubtful she’d make it to the atrium.

Since leaving the other volunteer guest testers, Frazie had been stopped by agency personnel thrice for a quick, upper-midlevel mind scan. A random inspection, they had each insisted. The young Aquato had thought she was being singled out for either her age or low security clearance until she glanced back to give the second agent who scanned her a piece of her metaphorical mind. 

That agent was being scanned by one of his peers.

She had quickened her pace at that.

Although the band near her heel was dampening her telepathy, there was a new heaviness in the air that only the unconscious could miss; a weight made eerier by how much emptier the base seemed to be that day. Eyes darted, locked, and swung away. Levitation balls shorted and bloated. Two executives who had known each other for years collided, spilling hot coffee on both of their suits, and kept walking without a word.

Frazie thought back to how Sasha and Milla had failed to visit her that morning. Did that have something to do with this? And if it did, what kind of mission could put the whole building on edge? She hoped they were alright.

Still wanting to get her letter delivered, she sidestepped into a service corridor she sometimes used to get to the mail room quicker. Dingier than the scenic route, but she wouldn’t be there long. Maybe she’d run into Nick Johnsmith here as she sometimes did, and the senior clerk of the mailroom could take her message the rest of the way while she made a beeline for the volunteer guest tester quarters. Jintly - and Marvin vicariously - would have to get their crackers some other time.

So focused was Frazie on the path ahead that she didn’t notice she wasn’t alone in that hallway apart from the faint scent of bacon. Even if she had, she may not have given the others walking it a second look. That second look would’ve granted her a rather perplexing sight.

She would have seen a wiry janitor with no mop and a diminutive dockworker who wasn’t at the docks. She would have spotted the sack with airholes slung over the taller fellow’s shoulders and the large, reinforced metal crate the shorter one was carrying on his tiny back. She wouldn’t have been quite so confused when strong hands pulled the bag over her body and flipped her into the box. The cold sliminess of a greasy grip sliding down – or up, in her current position - her left shin to slip something past her heel and off her foot would have still surprised and grossed her out though.

The crate’s lid latched closed with a soft click.

Frazie blinked in the darkness, baffled by the ease with which she’d been taken. She recounted the seconds that had brought her into this layered, cubic confinement; how she had allowed those dexterous, agile fingers to carry her here almost by instinct; as if she had done so many times before. She listened to the short, sprightly strides of whoever was carrying her crate, and the teen psychic’s face paled in disbelief. 

She had known that grip.

She recognized those steps.

Impossible familiarities.

Their owners were supposed to be an ocean away.

# Life at the Motherlobe

Three square meals a day from the world famous Noodle Bar.

Dorm mates she’s come to tolerate and even like, though more than once one of her errant hairs in the showers has been mistaken for a crimson, venomous snake (they’re longer than Marvin is tall).

Free “optional” training session for all her brain-borne skills.

Complimentary postage to send and receive letters.

Permission to customize her scrubs a tad.

And barely anyone bats an eye when she uses the main hall to keep her gymnastic skills sharp.

Sure the place is surrounded by water and the interns are a bit stuck up, but Frazie’s stay at the Motherlobe has been rather pleasant!

# The Marvels of MARBs: A New Psychic Health Invention!

Is your psychic child or adult acquaintance having a tough time controlling their burgeoning psychic powers? Are tinfoil hats proving ineffective? Are psychoisolation helmets too heavy (and expensive)?

Then you need some Mental Actuation Regulatory Bands - or MARBs as we like to call them - to help you and your loved ones develop their growing gifts safely and gradually.



Simply strap the MARB onto a wrist or ankle, connect it to the proprietary control console, and make or take allowances as needed.



Tone down the volume of telepathy spikes!  
Cool off those pyrokinesis flares!  
Lower the dangerous heights of spontaneous levitation!



All of it’s feasible with the only cerebral wellness accessory developed and endorsed by the Psychonauts.



MARBs come with a variety of strap and frame color combinations for expressing yourself while protecting yourself:

* Psi-Blast Blue
* Herbaphonic Burgundy
* Confusion Fuchsia
* Telekinetic Teal
* Cryo Ivory
* Motherlobe Gold
* and Pumpernickel, with more to come.

Pre-order now and receive a 7% Discount Card for the upcoming limited edition Psychic Six MARB series. Maintain the peace with your favorite hero of the free-thinking world at a symbolically reduced price, because their seventh member is YOU!

Keep your marbles with MARBs.

*-MARB Commercial Script Draft #4 for Initial Product Rollout*



The principle idea behind the Mental Actuation Regulatory Bands (or PSI-Shackles as their detractors call them) was to offer an adjustable, incremental alternative to straightforward psychoisolation helmets for limiting psychic abilities. 

It was observed that being totally cut off from one’s psychic powers had two common undesirable outcomes: immense physical and mental duress for those in psychoisolation and/or more rarely, the restrained individual eventually overcoming the limits imposed by the accessory, necessitating heavier and more expensive restraints. Such was the case with senior agent Compton Boole whose over-reliance on and frequent “upgrading” of psychoisolation helmets to manage his telepathy eventually resulted in irreversible musculoskeletal compressions to his spine, causing him to shrink a total of two inches in height.

That’s the official explanation anyway. Otto Mentalis only started developing the technology for the Booles. So he was thankful when Dogen’s adventures at Whispering Rock made it so he would not need a MARB, and was sorry that he got the straps working too late to be of any help to Compton.

The degree to which a MARB can stunt one’s psychic abilities can be adjusted. However, due to spatial constraints and safety concerns, there is a hard limit to how much a single one can do that; if one fails to suffice, the bandaid solution is just to use more MARBs as they’re seen as more modular and less drastic than outright psychoisolation if that isn’t an option. For instance, due to having a catastrophic reaction to the helmets, Frazie’s roommate Kelsa Heron currently wears thirteen MARBs on max settings instead.

Though MARBs can work when worn on the wrist or even neck, focus testing has shown that having them on the ankle causes the least amount of worry in their wearers. They don’t feel as inhibited if they can’t as easily or as often see that they’re being inhibited, it seems. Shame that, since these devices have built-in watches.

The MARBs that the Volunteer Guest Testers (and certain persons on probation such as Lab Tech Morceau Oleander) wear possess several features that the commercial ones do not. These include a heart rate monitor, a location tracker, and a “recess credit” bank that Otto is using to field test the introduction of digital mental currency into the Motherlobe. They also have a carefully considered low-yield emergency shock chip, just enough to stun a wearer for a moment, installed that can be remotely activated in a worst case scenario. An additional quirk to their usage that isn’t an outright trait is how those assigned them in the Motherlobe have all their ThinkerPrint privileges tied to their MARB; they wouldn’t be able to utilize any Motherlobe amenities or even open any doors without them.

It goes without saying that such persons of interest cannot easily remove their MARBs or adjust the level of limitation they pose on their own. They are taken off by Psychonaut personnel during health check ups, and the amount of dampening they emit is dialed back for tests and training exercises where appropriate. Should an individual show themselves to be trustworthy and responsible, it’s possible for them to be given more access to their psychic abilities at a new baseline.

Frazie has proven herself quite trustworthy and responsible. Currently, her MARB is set to low that it might as well not be on. That said, if this were a video game, and Frazie somehow lost nearly ALL of that trust, she could “level” it up through doing quests and progressing the story to regain the usage of her acquired powers. Basically, this would be her version of collecting PSI Cards and Markers.

But she’s cooperative and well-behaved if a tad sassy. It would take a screw-up of historical proportions to tank so much goodwill. Not necessarily by her own hand though.

# Subject: Bimonthly Temp Worker Assessment Dossier

Dear \[Name\],

My, how time flies. It’s been nearly a quarter of a year since that incident at Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp and the hasty (and costly) resolution of the subsequent class action lawsuit that cast the future of the Psychonauts as an institution in doubt. Yet look where we are. Still here.

Rest assured, our recent public-private partnership with Cognitive Technologies for Recreation and Leisure has ensured the upkeep and integrity of our organization for the foreseeable future.

Some restructuring was necessary in the short term, and we had to part ways with many longtime custodial and clerical staff, as well as a handful of reserve agents. We hope you’ve stayed in touch with any acquaintances from those groups, as well as made our new hires from the emergency employment drive a couple of months back feel welcome and appreciated. The numbers don’t lie and Grand Head Truman Zanotto loves what they’ve been telling him: this new blood has been keeping the body of the Motherlobe well-oxygenated and even made it healthier in some organs.

Which brings us to the first phase of normalization vetting. Enclosed, you’ll find our current impressions on this sleek batch of fresh yet capable talent. Don’t forget that your own insights matter immensely. Fill out the accompanying response form or arrange a meeting/call with our assessors to let us know who you think should become new sustainable members of our Psychonaut family.

Respectfully,

MHRD

P.S. We have also attached a missive addressing a recurring “Wall Growler” rumor to put the matter to rest.

**Commentary:**

* Art by [Pocheezy](https://www.tumblr.com/pocheezy).
* This story had a ""tidy"" alternate ending where Oleander takes full responsibility for both his actual crimes and the hydrokinetic ""attack"" on the asylum. He claims that it's to finally escape Whispering Rock for good and to go down in history as one of the greatest psychic criminals who ever lived, but Lili's skeptical about that, and despite how she pointedly doesn't have much sympathy for the coach, she thinks that he took the heat so that Frazie would have more time to reckon with what she pulled off with the water before the Psychonauts figure out that Morceau is lying. Frazie says it's a nice thought and that she'll try to pop in next summer to see how everyone is doing but for now she's going to head home and have a nice long, talk with her family. She, Augustus, and Sugarcube ride off into the sunset, semi-awkwardly. Three months later, Frazie would receive a letter from Lili inviting her and the other Aquatos to visit the Motherlobe.
* Felt a bit too neat though, and skipped over ways Frazie would have to reckon with her family about running away from home and hiding her psychic powers for years.
* But I'm getting ahead of myself.

I think if I want a good life while being blind, I'll have to become an alcoholic. I don't really know how to be blind.","I have a condition that I don't know if it exists, but I would call it anxiety about being blind.

Basically, I don't know how to be blind, and I feel embarrassed interacting with the sighted world because I'm blind. Let me explain: I'm not shy because I can talk to sighted people for simple things, like university assignments, asking simple questions, and things like that.

But what I can't do is live with this disability. Beyond that, I don't have a single sighted friend; my only friends are also blind, which I'm grateful for. Because without them, I wouldn't have any friends. But other than that, I'd like to be a normal college student, doing the things a 19-year-old does without worrying. Every time I hear the guys in my class talking about going to a party or planning something as a group without me being part of it, I feel like crying. I have a thought of saying, ""Damn, if I weren't blind, I'd be in on it."" Telling them to fuck off isn't easy. Yes, I know I don't need to go to a party, but I want to. I feel like a burden to everyone because I need them to help me go with them, to guide me so I can keep up with them, and people don't make that effort. Soon I'll be alone at university. In a year, they'll cut the only guy I talk to out of my group, and I don't even know if we're friends. We only go out together to smoke cigarettes between classes, but those 10 minutes we smoke help me a lot. I feel like I don't know if we're friends because sometimes I feel like he's just using me for my money. I pay for the cigarettes we both finish, and if I ask him to come with me to buy a coffee, he only does it so I'll buy him one too. But I think I'd rather spend a little more than be completely alone. My family is very close; we all get together very often, and while my cousins ​​sit together talking about anything and everything, I'm alone, off on my phone.

I don't like drawing attention to myself just because I'm blind. Everyone stares at you just because you're blind, and that gives me anxiety—that people expect something spectacular from me that isn't there. I want to travel, but the idea alone panics me; it gives me an anxiety attack. The only thing that helps me feel good about myself is alcohol. I love it. After a few drinks, all that anxiety just fades away, and I'm functionally blind.

I remember on my last trip to the beach, I started drinking, and after a few drinks, I could talk to people without anxiety. I chatted with a cousin for ages, something I wouldn't do sober. I did whatever I wanted without worrying about anything, like my brain gave me a space of tranquility. I couldn't drink any more because my parents stopped me, but that was almost a year ago. The other times I've drunk with my family, it's been the same, and I love it. On the other hand, when I drink with my blind friends, I drink until I'm completely wasted. In Mexico, we have an expression, ""tomar hasta las manitas"" (drinking until your hands), which literally means drinking until you vomit and can't even move your hands anymore. I do it because it calms me down. I have a lot of plans for myself in the next few years, but I can't imagine achieving them without drinking.

I went to therapy for a while, but I didn't achieve anything. I was ashamed to talk about myself and my disability, and when I did, I still didn't achieve anything.

I don't even know what I'm trying to achieve with this post, just to talk about it and vent, maybe to find someone who understands me. My blind friends lead normal lives, with friends, and I couldn't understand. They would understand.

As I warmed up my car, I smelled the burnt heater smell against the frigid winter air and I remembered the back of your mom’s car after you picked me up from the airport.

The ear to ear grin on your face. How you snapped your fingers impatiently to hold your hand over the seat back and kept peeking back at me to smile. I melted.

As I walked in, I passed the racks of plants and vines for sale.

All such a deep, lush green. I never noticed green the way I do now. It reminds me of the version of you I knew when I first met you. The calm you brought me, and your artistic side. I had no clue what “Phthalo Green” was before. Now I see you often, in the trees, the plants, anything with life.

I smelled the rich aroma of coffee on the cold air and remembered you telling me “it smells like love” the first time I sent you coffee in the mail.

I loved that coffee. I haven’t touched it since. It was my favorite thing to surprise you because it felt like I was sharing part of me.

An ocean blue bag of ground brown beans with a hula girl. Silly.

A coffee bag spilled a little into my suitcase when I visited, and I never picked up the stray grounds because it smelled so good, and reminded me of you.

As I went home, I listened to Flicker by Tiny Habits. The same song I used to put on for a chill day when I would come home from my military training and talk to you. I always looked forward to talking to you. It brought the same peace you did and now I associate the two.

So after these things, I ordered butter chicken. I have hardly ever had Indian food ever….until I met you. You made me some when I visited you and made sure I knew EXACTLY which jar to buy if I ever wanted and how good it was. You were right. It was like crack. 

I started to work on my French again, and miss your giggles and scoffs when I would try to pronounce something. Sometimes I said it wrong on purpose just because of how cute you were.

I fell in love with you at the wrong time. Is that a thing? I focused too much energy away from some of the things I needed to prioritize. I fell apart. I was broken from someone that took advantage of the love I had to give before I met you and had reduced me to ashes.

I don’t know what the right timing is, and sometimes the remnants of my childhood make me afraid to lose the good things in my life.

I got negative and overwhelmed by the other things I was overcoming in my life. I am sorry.

I can say I loved you and thought of you always. I still do. It has been hard. I loved the good and bad parts of you. I saw the parts that mirrored my own.

I wouldn’t have even gone in if it weren’t for the flooding... my rentals are expensive and I can’t ruin them. Today is the only time I’ve ever been tempted to hire outside help, but this is a business, and I need to pull it together. I just need a distraction. 

The sobering smell of human waste is usually plenty to hold my attention, so I don’t see why constantly trying not to vomit wouldn’t be enough, but still, I can’t get rid of the feeling that something is just… off. It’s so hard to explain. I have so much anxiety all the time so I know what that feels like, and this is kind of like that, but also not. Everything feels like it’s not real, maybe? Normal, everyday things just don’t feel normal. I rushed through the flooding cleanup until it was good enough to leave for tomorrow. I needed to be alone. 

I went back to my office and opened the mini fridge. I was greeted with every sauce I’ve ever been given by a fast food place but nothing to drink. I guess I forgot to restock the fridge yesterday. Normally I would run to the store to get something cold but I honestly just need to be alone. I grabbed a warm can and took a sip, but just like everything else, it just… isn’t… *right.* Obviously canned margaritas aren’t as good warm, but it tastes kind of wrong? It just tastes slightly worse than normal, I don’t know. I lifted the can to check the expiration date, but it should still be good for the next 3 months. Fine to drink then, just unpleasant. I did the only thing any reasonable person would and chugged it. Bottoms up. 

The second wasn’t better. Or the third. None of them were spoiled, they just were slightly worse than warm? I’m not sure what to do with myself. Something is just not right. I looked down at the clock and saw it was almost 2:30pm… I could go pick up the kids! They will be super excited to get a ride home instead of having to go to daycare and take the bus home! It took about 20 minutes, but I was there to pick them up on time and everything!

They aren’t excited. They’re looking at me like I’ve done something wrong, like I’m a monster? 

“Daddy, did you pick us up because Kyra was kill’ded?”

I’m not panicking, I can’t be panicking. I am a great father and I also need to focus on driving.

Stay focused.

Stay focused.

STAY FOCUSED.

Fuck, wait, you need to respond to your kid. What are you even doing?

“Where did you hear that?”

The blood rushing through my ears made it almost impossible to hear what Andrew said. I think he said something about Scaught whatever-the-fuck-last-name. I’ll never remember his last name, he’s just the stupid kid with the stupid name who always has all of the gossip regardless of whether it’s real. Yes, they spell ‘Scott’ as ‘Scaught.’ I hate the new generation. Once I made him repeat it, I heard it clear as day.

“Where is Kyra?”

I guess you can’t have blood rushing through your ears if your heart stops.

“Why are you asking about her now? We haven’t seen her in a long time.” It was so hard not to let out a disingenuous laugh, but I was afraid Andrew would think it was a scoff. It would have been a scoff. It was hard not to.

“Scaught said she died. Is Kyra died? Is that why you went to the police today?”

“You know Scaught makes up stories. I went with the police today because I wanted to help them catch a bad guy.”

“But you seemed mad”

“I wasn’t mad, I was serious because it’s always important to help the police. It’s always important. We always help the police if they ask for help.”

“Okay, Daddy. Can I tell you about the book we’re reading in class?”

“I’d love to hear about it!”

I could not tell you what that book was about to save my life. I want to be a good dad but it’s just so boring! Kyra scolded me for it once. Not actually scolding, more like your boss who is “just one of the guys” who smiles while they tell you that you did something wrong. They don’t have to even be mean for you to know you are being scolded, even while they smile like Barbies. If anything, it’s worse because they are just being so fake, like that one robot they had on all of the talk shows however long ago. It just doesn’t feel right. 

Things didn’t get better when we got home. I had a shit awful day and wanted to treat myself and my family to a special night because I’ve earned a treat, but my wife just doesn’t *get* me. 

“We are **_not_** going out to celebrate Kyra’s death!?”

“We aren’t celebrating anything! I just had a hard day and wanted to have fun with my family!”

“So you’ve been seeing her again. When was the last time you saw her??”

“In court, like I told the cops. Sorry I’ve been such a terrible husband and dad, I guess.”

Fuck, I really just wanted to hang out with my family! Or maybe I just didn’t want to be alone. Idk. Nothing feels right. 

I went to my home office and poured a glass of my best tequila. Then another. Then another. Then just half of one more. I was fully capable of walking correctly and everything! I wasn’t watching the time, though, so the kids and my wife were already in bed. I got into bed and cuddled her as the big spoon, but when I was about to fall asleep, I got a phone call.

It was from a blocked number. Part of me was certain it was Kyra, but I’ve changed my number since I last spoke with her. My wife made me after she called me begging for a ride for her stupid cat or dog or whatever. She was right! I mean yeah, I know you don’t have parents to call, but whose fault is that?! I need to work on my marriage! It’s not my fault you’ve burned every bridge you came across! 

“Have you checked the children?”

It was very clearly her voice, but it sounded almost like she was trying to make it sound like it wasn’t herself. She probably dislocated both sides of her jaw for this! I’ve never heard her speak that way before, something about how if you have a joint condition it’s bad to let it happen, idk. Still, my heart sank. She wouldn’t! Right?

Right?

Right??

I ran upstairs and they were asleep. I can’t believe I fell for such a cheap trick, but those are my children and I’m an excellent father! I would never take any risks. Still, I was afraid my wife would yell at me when I get back to the bedroom. I considered sleeping on the pull-out my wife sleeps on when she’s mad at me, but decided that I was just being a good dad and checking on the kids so I shouldn’t be afraid to face her.

The second I walked into the room, she shot up at a perfect right angle, like the posture you see in diagrams. I braced myself for the verbal lashing, but when I finally dared to unclench my eyes, she was rolling her head around like you would to stretch your neck. She’s ~~a secretary~~ an office assistant. That makes sense overall but after 2 full neck circles, it was still clicking- no, *snapping*- and just got louder. It was loud enough I was starting to wonder if she’d snapped her own neck but then she threw herself back onto the bed. She’d never been someone who sleepwalks or whatever, but at this point I ran up to her and touched her shoulder.

“Jared, what did you do to Kyra?” She asked softly, barely louder than a whisper.

“You’re asleep. I didn’t do anything to Kyra.”

Despite being asleep on her left side, my wife jerked her head almost half way around and insisted:

“What did you do to Kyra?” Only this time, I’d swear was in Kyra’s voice, I’m absolutely certain! I’d bet my life on it! Still, the laugh was definitely my wife’s.

I slept on the pull out.

***

The next morning I tried to be normal for my family, but something was very wrong. I stopped for coffee and some fucking beer that was actually cold on the way to the office, but I felt like everyone was staring at me. They weren’t glaring or smiling, they seemed to be normal people doing normal things if you looked at them, but they weren’t. I could only see if they didn’t know I could, but they were staring at me. Everyone was staring at me. Not normal judgemental staring, either. They were standing with their whole body facing me and staring at me, expressionless. They were barely a step above Amish dolls, they just… were looking. All of them. But the cashiers wouldn’t look at me when I was trying to pay, just stare when I saw them out of the corner of my eye. I come here every day and only ever buy alcohol if I forget to refrigerate mine! Why would they they judge?? I’m not drinking like it’s 2022!

I know I should never go back to this shop again, but today I’m really glad it was on the way to the office because I **NEED** to know what Kyra is saying about me and didn’t want a citation for opening my beer in the car outside of the shop. It was worth finding another shop for this, because I need answers NOW. 

The second I got back on my land, I googled our city’s crime reports, then murders near me, then gave up and googled Kyra’s name. The only break I took was to put my warm drinks into my fridge, but then I was right back to my Google. I was so relieved to see I had a comment on my last post about someone else maybe also being framed by Kyra?? I tried to message him a ton and commented on his post but he said I’m crazy and I think he blocked me. I’m not crazy. I can’t be! Lights are dimmer if I want them bright or brighter when I want them to be dim. Everything tastes wrong even though it isn’t spoiled. And the staring?? Something is wrong! That man told me I was crazy! I feel crazy! I went to put more canned margaritas in my fridge but I guess I’m out. 

I really need to go get supplies for work, but I should go home. I can’t go back to that shop. I don’t want to go anywhere but home. The cold beer in the fridge is just a bonus but honestly, I just want to see my children. As soon as I’d gotten to the area where I had service again, I got a text from my wife asking me to grab milk for dinner. Fuck! I really wish I could pretend I didn’t see it, but I know she knows I did. We set up a lot of different “I trust you, but let’s try”’s after Kyra. She knows where I am, she knows I’ve seen it, and she knows my phone isn’t dead. I have to get the milk. 

I decided to stop at Kroger since it was on the way, but I wish I didn’t. It was just like this morning… everyone was just staring, but never if I looked directly at them. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. This is a much bigger store with so many more people and so much more space. I felt like I was on display. I know I was afraid my wife would be mad, but this is a different kind of fear. You know that feeling where it’s like your heart fell into your ass and is just stuck there? This felt like that but also itchy, like every hair on my body was standing on end. I wanted to leave without the milk but if I did my wife would be furious. She knows I stopped. I just grabbed whatever milk and went to the register. 

I couldn’t help but be distracted by the cashier ringing me up. She was a stunner, at least a 9 out of 10. She had long, slightly curly hair that went about to the end of her rib cage. She was thin enough I could see her ribs through her tight Kroger shirt, but not thin enough to be flat chested. She was actually very blessed in that department, and so was I, considering she wasn’t wearing a bra. It was hard not to think about gently running my thumb across her hard nipples before sucking them while I carefully slip my hand into her jeans. She wanted to tell me about some survey so she leaned forward to circle it on the receipt, but when she got closer to me I could tell something was very wrong. Her breath was foul. It reminded me of the sweet, sinus burning smell of rotting meat. 

She exhaled really hard before saying, “so just go to this site putting in my name, Kyra.”

“What was your name? Sorry?”

Her voice dropped several decibels as she dropped the customer service smile and widened her eyes to repeat, “my name is Kyra. Does that bother you, Jared?”

I just told her to have a good day and hurried out to my car, but I realised I left the milk and had to go back in for it. I handed them my receipt, they handed me the milk, and I left in a hurry. I glanced at the receipt before sliding it into my pocket and dropped my keys and milk.

For the last couple of years, I have noticed that stress is getting the best of me. 

I am not going to bore with too much details, but I would say that prior to my issues, I was kind of addicted to stress. I would constantly drink a lot of coffee, pump myself up, train very intensely, sometime several times a day, run at very high HR and skip rest, recovery and relaxation.

After years of doing this, I finally broke down after completing an Ultra marathon, after also competing in some martial arts bouts, and training like a madman, and also working 150% with 3 different projects.

I was hospitalized because they thought I have had a heart attack, but after a lot of testing, they concluded I am actually physically fine, but was severely overtrained and overexhausted myself.

This is now two years ago and I still feel like I haven't recovered. I am almost 40 years old and I have taken steps towards a more balanced life. I drink a lot less coffee, I train normally, keep myself fit and try to overall be a calm person.

But even though I am doing a lot of good things, I constantly have a high HR even when sitting down and not doing anything crazy (90+) and my Garmin watch constantly shows that I  in ""High Stress"" (80-90 out of 100). My HRV is quite low (low 30s) and I just don't feel like I have ever been able to truly relax in my life, even though I do things like floating, yoga, meditation, regular exercise etc. 

I don't feel mentally stressed or anxious, but I do feel like my energy bucket is leaking and I am constantly tired. I am open to trying whatever to get back on track, so please feel free to let me know what I can do to:

1. Stress less  
2. Don't feel constantly exhausted

  
Some context:

1. I work with computers, so I sit long hours in front of a screen

2. I am athletic, don't have any medical issues that I am aware of

3. I live in a warm country, and I don't have any financial issues

4. I have friends, a wife, a sex life and I a nice apartment 

5. I eat a pescatarian diet

6. I don't really drink (anymore), I don't smoke (anymore), I don't do drugs (anymore)

On Christmas, my roommate and I always make plans to be conveniently out of town - it’s an easy way to be unavailable to family.

This year we have tickets to ride the train up to Reno. We’re only staying for one night and then taking the train back down. There’s only one scheduled train both days, so it’s pretty obvious which train we will be on.

Any other Christmas orphans riding the train?

We don’t have any major plans and I’ve never taken this trip. I’m really looking forward to the scenery and the mountains. I know it’s a long shot, but I figured I would reach out and see if there was anybody else heading in the same direction.

The picture is our 2024 escape to Napa. In other years we have gone to Vegas and Discovery Kingdom.

**Question:**

_https: //imgur. com/a/1trdCmGIz this eczema? The 2nd hand looks much better. I dont think I ever had these cuts in my my life before the last 2 weeks. I moved to another country and nothing changed except I sleep way less, drink more coffee, and outside more, so I wash my hands with soap way more. Cold water kinda hurts. Making a fist hurts. There is 0 itching, just some pain. I tried to ignore it but the cuts keep getting deeper instead of disappearing. What should I do?_

**Answer:**

Hey! I’m really sorry to hear about the difficulties you’re facing with your hands. Moving to a new country is a huge change, and it’s tough when your body starts acting up. It seems like a lot of things have shifted for you, from sleep to daily habits.

Sometimes, when we go through big transitions, our bodies react in surprising ways. Psychosomatic processing is an approach where physical symptoms are seen as linked to unresolved psychological stress. The body might be manifesting its stress response through the skin.

One possible angle is that these cuts might be connected to stress about the move or changes in your lifestyle. Maybe there’s a part of you that feels exposed or raw like your skin.

Here are a few questions you might want to reflect on:

1. Has the move brought any unexpected stress that you're brushing off?

2. Is there something about the new environment that feels harsh or abrasive, similar to how your skin feels?

3. Do you feel like you’re bearing too much change at once?

4. Are there areas of your life where you feel like you need more protection?

5. Is there a part of your past environment that you’re holding onto?

Hope this gives you something to think about. Feel free to ask if you have more questions!",1,1766213967.0,mytorial,0,1.0,False
1pr85od,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pr85od/i_30f_am_having_doubts_about_my_relationship_with/,I [30F] am having doubts about my relationship with my husband [33M]," I will start this by saying my husband is my best friend and one of my favourite people in the world. He’s kind, funny, honest, affectionate, and we choose to spend most of our free time together since we love each others company. I can’t imagine ever being without him, and everyone says we have a perfect relationship and people often comment on how much we adore each other and how we are inseparable. I have a busy work schedule while he used to work from home and now is out of work, so he’ll often cook my favourite meals, do odd jobs for me etc. 

I’ve recently been struggling a bit with my mental health, and at the same time have been having some doubts about the relationship, and more than anything am seeking some reassurance/advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation. While things are great 99% of the time, there are a few issues that have been playing on my mind:

A few times I’ve caught him being secretive on his phone. Usually we will go on each others phones - he’s even logged into his email/social media on my phone for when he wants to use it so secrecy has never been an issue. A couple of times when I’ve grabbed his phone he’s freaked out and snatched the phone back off me. One day he’d been a bit secretive, and later that day I’d borrowed his phone to look something up and he’d been using chat gpt to write smut, so kind of just assumed he was embarrassed about that and didn’t think much more about it. More recently I noticed him angling the phone away from me and when I looked over I saw he was on a messaging app. I asked him what he was doing and he said nothing, and then when I pushed said he was messaging his brother. I knew this wasn’t true as he has a theme on his brothers messenger chat that’s a different colour so I got upset and demanded he tell me the truth. Eventually he admitted he had reached out to one of his former tutees (he used to do English tuition, and with this student it became an arrangement where she would teach him Spanish too) to see what she was up to. He’s not spoken to her for about 10 years, so it was a bit out of the blue and he thought I’d find it weird, but did show me the chat and a secret folder or app or something that he kept it in (?) and did give the password and offer to let me look at anything on his phone to ‘prove himself’ but I rejected that as I trust him, and him being willing to do that surely means there’s nothing to hide and he’s never given me any other reason to doubt him.

We live in another European country and moved here for me as I got a really great work opportunity. My husband works in marketing so was able to work remotely, and this worked well; with my pay rise and his income, we were financially very comfortable. He really didn’t want to move here at first, but did it for me which I know many partners would not. A few years later he loves it and never wants to leave as conditions are much better and it feels much safer than our home country. Unfortunately he lost his job 6 months ago, but hasn’t tried to find another one. We are managing fine financially but have to send money home each month and our rent has gone up. He’s not made any effort to find another job and tells me we’re fine on just my salary, and he can’t take a job in our country as the pay would be lower than his last job. This has been a bit of a source of argument recently, as he’s quite extravagant in his spending and although he sometimes cooks for me, he does little in terms of chores so I come home to a messy apartment and he’ll only do something if I ask multiple times. If I ask him to do something like pick up my medication or buy groceries he’ll often forget. He has adhd so it’s hard for him to do these things so I pay for a cleaner to help him, and he often forgets to withdraw the cash to pay her so even that is something I have to take on. He likes going out for lunch and coffees during the week, and has a friend who works nearby so he’ll see her a few times a week either for food or swimming as they’re both keen swimmers. Sometimes I get frustrated when I’ve had a busy and tough day at work and he’s been relaxing/socialising and making no effort to help around the house or get a job. He’s been working on some personal projects which he claims is more valuable than taking a sub standard job, but they are not bringing money in. My brothers have given him multiple tips as they work in a similar industry, but he’s not tried any of their suggestions and he just says it won’t work. My friends noticed that while I’m always turning things down to save money, he still spends like before - ordering expensive wines, choosing the most expensive dish on the menu when we go out etc. He’s recently been saying he wants expensive things like designer clothes, new headphones, a new laptop etc. I have shut these down saying we can’t afford them since he doesn’t have a job, but he always makes out that I’m being unfair as we technically still can afford it with savings.

Recently we had an argument as he was asking me to plan him a birthday trip abroad. (Some back story: a few Christmases ago we decided to gift each other trips away since we love to travel. I planned a long weekend trip to a neighbouring country and he absolutely loved it and was so grateful. He never planned anything for me, and blamed it on his adhd). When I pushed back on the birthday trip as we’re trying to save money, he got angry with me and said it’s not fair: it’s his birthday he should get to do what he wants. I pointed out that I planned him a trip for his birthday last year and we just did a meal out for mine. I suggested we do a meal out for him too and he scoffed, so I mentioned that I’d still not had my trip from a few years ago, then he felt really guilty and apologised saying he’ll plan a trip for me (I know he won’t, but it’s ok - I actually enjoy planning trips so I’m not that bothered).

The final thing, and what bothers me the most by far, is he’s not been the most supportive with my struggles with my mental health. We recently travelled abroad for a family holiday, and I was really struggling and fighting back tears the whole time and he was fully aware of this, more so than anyone else. We’d been out drinking with my cousins since around midday, and I said I was going to leave early since I wasn’t feeling great mentally. My cousin asked him if he was going to take me home and he said no, he wanted to stay out. She chose to come back with me as she was worried about me since I’d been emotional all day. I asked my husband to please not stay out late as I wanted company, but he didn’t come home for another 3-4 hours and claimed he didn’t know I was upset. I told him I’d been having suicidal thoughts, and was feeling at my lowest and he immediately felt guilty and apologised reassuring me he wanted to be there for me in future. Despite this, it has become a bit of a recurring theme - he loves to party and normally I do too, but alcohol has been making me feel so much worse so he knows I’ve been trying to drink less and leave early, but he always convinces me to stay/drink more and even gets our friends to pressure me into staying out. When I do eventually leave, he will stay out and not come back til late and not check in with me. It makes me feel like he doesn’t care, and it hurts as if I knew he was upset I would drop everything to comfort him, and to be honest wouldn’t be able to stay out and enjoy myself knowing that he’s upset alone. My friends and family have been so supportive, so the difference is quite noticeable to me, and is making me question everything about our relationship as in the past he’s always been the first person I can count on. He’s always apologetic and promises to do better when I talk about it, but nothing has changed.

I can’t talk to any of my friends or family about this as I don’t want them to think badly of him since he is otherwise an amazing husband, but feel at a bit of a loss with how to deal with this, so any outside perspectives would be greatly appreciated!

I moved to Mandaluyong recently and thought it would be nice to meet people in the area 😊

I’m mostly a homebody, but I enjoy meaningful conversations. It can be about anything, from random daily life stuff and memes to unexpectedly deep thoughts. I’m usually calm and thoughtful, laugh at random things (dad jokes included lol), and I value honesty and kindness.

I’m not looking for anything romantic — just genuine friendships and good company. And maybe someone to attend simbang gabi with, grab coffee, or just talk about life.

If you’re chill, respectful, and also looking for friends nearby, feel free to message me. It would be nice to get to know you 🌸

It’s super smooth and light not sour or acidic at all. Tastes really balanced. You can pick up subtle notes of cherry and I also get a light cocoa flavor…the combination of having it with dosa and sambar hits different!!

This has been a side effect I have received after getting SIBO that I have had for 6 years and cannot get rid of despite every gold standard and alternative treatment method I have tried (lots of money spent). My levels are not that high and my symptoms during the day when eating are basically nonexistent. However, my motility has slowed where now I take motegrity for it (does not work that well) motility activator and magnesium daily with 3 cups of coffee. And no matter what I eat. or take, or do, I have bloating and intestinal pain after pooping that sometimes makes me scream it is so bad. 

Before having SIBO I pooped normally within 5 minutes of getting up with zero issues, no pain absolutely not one problem. 

Now it takes me an hour to go, with all the stuff I listed, drinking a ton of water and walking around. It still doesn’t take that long to go, it does not hurt, but within 5 minutes after it’s over it feels like someone is mangling my intestines and I am shocked for how long this goes on for. 

Tests come back nothing. Colonoscopy nothing, scans nothing, sitz marker nothing. The motility clinic was booked out so far the authorization my doctor put in would expire before I got an appointment, so I need to follow up on that and keep calling because they couldn’t even make me an appointment.

1pr7x4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1pr7x4k/if_inflation_is_only_27_why_am_i_paying_so_much/,"If inflation is only 2.7%, why am I paying so much more for meat and coffee?","The latest [**CPI report**](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf) has been confusing to some because a 2.7% increase seems absurdly low for some goods. But this figure is only the *weighted* increase across a very wide range of goods, and the variation in increase can be quite high.

Fortunately, the report also includes annual inflation rates for a huge range of goods, starting from [**Table 1**](https://imgur.com/a/8ePyoG5) (broad categories) and [**Table 2**](https://imgur.com/a/G1ok61W) (detailed categories). And from November 2024 to November 2025, some goods certainly *have* skyrocketed in price, including but not limited to:

* Beef and veal are up over 15%, with roasts being up over 20%!

* Frozen fish are up almost 12%

* Instant coffee is up 25%

* Fuel oil is up 11%

* Audio equipment is up 10%

**This means that lots of consumers whose shopping preferences involve a lot of the more-inflated goods will indeed be paying a lot more.****

Two other crucial things to keep in mind:

1. The annualized inflation rate above (2.7%) is a comparison from *November* 2024 to November 2025. But what you remember is probably 2024's prices *overall*, which were lower on average than in November 2025!

2. The BLS uses *seasonal adjustment* to generally mitigate the influence of seasonal abundance or deficit, sales, etc. This is necessary to fairly compare prices across months and avoid ""silly"" results where it looks like prices have skyrocketed but it's just a fruit's off-season. But what you remember is the actual prices you paid at the counter, which *are* affected by seasonal factors.

The best way to check out the price change of an individual good is to use [**the BLS data finder**](https://data.bls.gov/dataQuery/find?fq=survey:%5Bcu%5D&s=popularity:D). It will show you the calculated index for various things, which is basically the technical measure they use for prices.

For example, say I feel like steaks have gone up a crazy amount in the last 2 years. [**I can find the non-seasonally-adjusted dataset for beef steaks**](https://data.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CUUR0000SEFC03) and compare the January 2024 index (281.658) to the November 2025 index (332.599). That's an 18% increase in terms of what I might actually *feel* prices went up by since 2024, almost 4% higher than the seasonally adjusted Nov 2024 to Nov 2025 inflation for that good!

Finally, all these indexes are effectively just weighted averages across a wide range of stores and states. That doesn't mean that *your* individual store reflects that pricing, and different stores have different pricing strategies — which, under capitalism, can absolutely include price gouging the hell out of you if elasticity for that good is low in your area and they know you'll buy it anyway.

For example, John might be charged $30 per pound for a steak at his store and feel that's insane, while Laura might be charged $8 for a large bag of chips — they'll both have the *experience* of crazy inflation, even if John is actually paying less than average for chips and Laura is paying less than average for steak. The human mind pays particular attention to stimuli that are very negative; neither of them are likely to go through the store noticing all the goods that have only risen *a little*.

**The best thing you can do to reduce the effect of inflation on your own wallet is to determine which goods are less inflated and shift your shopping preferences.** Right now, those goods include:

* Fruits, espepcially citrus
* Vegetables, especially potatoes and tomatoes
* *Frozen* fruits and vegetables
* Rice and pasta
* White breads 
* Frozen bakery products
* Chicken (compared to other meats)
* Most dairy products

Fortunately, that mix is overall reasonably healthy. There are also a number of other products that are experiencing much less inflation or even deflation but are still priced quite high (e.g. eggs), so keep an eye on those products to see if they dip further.

Finally, on a side note but an important one, **remember to ask for a raise!** Inflation very rarely ever dips below 0%, which means that goods are *always* rising in price overall. Your quality of life absolutely depends on your wage growth outpacing inflation, and the universe won't make that happen for you automatically. Overall wages are up slightly more than inflation right now, but if *you're* not experiencing that growth, you need to go ask for it.",6,1766213076.0,economy,5,0.8,False

I live with my 23F sister, who is a nurse working three 7pm–7am overnight shifts a week, and her 24M boyfriend. We all live in Tx, my mom lives in Louisiana. 

I’m currently on Christmas break. The only time all three of us could come home for Christmas together was Dec.18th–22nd. My sister and her boyfriend had to leave on the 22nd for work, but I planned to stay an extra week or two. 

Earlier in the week, my mom asked in a group chat if we were coming home Thursday or Friday. I said Thursday afternoon or night. She was excited because she hadn’t seen us in over a month.

On Thursday, my sister got home from an insanely busy overnight shift around 9am and immediately went to bed. We originally planned to leave around 5–7pm, but she was still asleep and clearly exhausted.

While she was sleeping, my aunt and uncle (who I’m very close with) were in town briefly for a graduation and asked if I wanted to grab coffee or dinner to say hi before they left. I went, expecting we’d still leave later that night.

While I was with them, my mom texted asking when we were leaving, then called me. I didn’t see the call and missed it. When I noticed later, the call had already ended, and I planned to call her back once we were leaving. Around 7pm my sister woke up and called her.

Shortly after, my mom texted me upset, saying I wasn’t answering and that she felt unloved and ignored. She sent a long message saying she would continue paying my car note and insurance and give me $500 for tuition for Christmas, but after that she wouldn’t provide financial help anymore. She said she was done feeling unloved and that if I wanted to talk to her, I could reach out.

I apologized multiple times, explained I wasn’t trying to ignore her, and said I cared about our relationship. She said she didn’t want us coming home anymore and that she didn’t really want to see us anyway.

Despite that, we decided to come home Friday and planned to stay elsewhere if things got bad. Traffic was awful, and we didn’t arrive until around 8pm. She was immediately cold and passive-aggressive, giving one-word answers and avoiding conversation.

Later that night, we went to get food and I asked if she wanted anything. She agreed but acted irritated, rushed me out of her room, and gave me $20 for her food. When we got back about an hour later, she refused the food, complained it took too long, and said she paid for it anyway so there was nothing to thank us for.

This turned into a heated argument where she accused us of only being home for other family and presents, repeatedly said she “didn’t care” if we stayed or left, and wouldn’t answer directly if she wanted us there. She eventually told us to leave her room.

About five minutes later, my sister went back in, apologized for things getting heated, and said she loved her. My mom said “thanks, we’ll talk in the morning.”

I am writing this open letter because I share roughly the same age group as your \[insert relationship to JMB here\]. **I'm a young adult male as well, and I live in a town like yours, with a nationally recognized university, an award-winning high school, and a close sense of community.** I've grown up with some level of privilege as well; despite being only 24 years old at time of writing, I rub shoulders with mayors, community leaders, university staff, churches, and even a state rep or two. I played very little sport in high school and virtually none in college, but I used the same locker rooms as star athletes during gym class.

The point is, I understand how much community, school, and sports mean to towns like Stillwater Oklahoma, or Bourbonnais Illinois. And I understand how privilege can give you the wrong idea about life at times; *indeed, I've gotten a lot more passes in life than I probably deserved.*

I also understand what it means to be a promising young man, loaded with book smarts, good looks, and a vibrant friend group.

I further understand what it's like to be taken in by the world of internet smut; some of the stuff I've seen over the years would make older generations puke.

In a sense, Jesse and I have a lot in common. We've both been described as good, if somewhat flawed, kids with promising futures.

But here's what you need to understand: Jesse is ***not*** a good kid- he's a **child strangler** and a **child rapist**.

When I was growing up, strangulation was made fun of in cartoons like *The Simpsons*, prosecutors rarely took it seriously unless the victim was visibly injured, and police would look for marks on the victim's neck, and if none were found, the words ""He choked me"" didn't mean much to them.

Today, we know differently. We know that strangulation is not just a run-of-the-mill form of abuse, or even a scary red flag for further abuse. It is a man raising his hand high in the air and saying ""Look at me, I am a killer."" Even Homer Simpson knows that now. But unlike Homer Simpson, Jesse can't simply rewrite his behavior and no longer be a strangler. He will always be a strangler, and he will always be a child rapist, even if the law refuses to describe him as such come August 2026.

I get it, you don't want to see your \[insert relationship here\] that way. In your mind, Jesse is a promising young kid who made a mistake. Or maybe you don't even think he made a mistake. Maybe you think that somehow, some way, the marks on Victim 1 and Victim 2's necks were made by someone else, even though he filmed himself doing it.

But think of it this way: if Jesse was a promising young man with a bright future, why would he squander it with sexual violence, even to the point where one of his victims was seconds away from death?

Because he's not a good kid, and he doesn't have a promising future.

**He's a child rapist and a child strangler, and he always will be.** He will always have narcissistic personality disorder, sexual fantasies about harming and abusing women and likely children as well, and he will always have memories locked away of raping and strangling children, even though the videos he made

But because you made a sweetheart deal with another privileged family likely full of young men with the same promising future of sexual and physical violence without any input from the victims or their families, in six months the conviction won't even appear on Jesse's record. He won't even have to notify future partners that he's an attempted murderer and rapist. He'll never spend a day behind bars until/unless he fulfills his promise, **which I fear will mean producing more victims, and this time silencing his victims by finishing the job he failed to do with either of his child victims and murdering them.**

I understand that you love Jesse dearly, and feel the need to stick up for your \[insert relationship here\]. That's what families are for, right?

But there are other ways to be there for your \[insert relationship here\] that don't involve excusing his behavior, taking selfies of him rocking Gucci shades in the courtroom waiting area, bonding him out of jail after he raped and strangled women, and negotiating a corrupt bargain behind closed doors while the victims are shut out of the discussion.

For example, you could've visited Jesse in prison. You could've advocated for Jesse to get therapy as part of his sentencing, including family therapy. You could've advocated for him to get 10 years, 20 years, or 30 years, instead of 78. When he got out, you could've driven him to meetings with his parole officer, taken him to his monthly sex registration appointments and cried in the lobby while he registered his name and address and had his mugshot taken wishing things had gone differently, started a small business where Jesse could be employed and work to pay off his restitution (which I know you can do because you practically run the town), or used some of your connections to get Jesse a job. You could've acted as accountability partners to ensure Jesse complies with his registry requirements and stays off social media and pornography sites.

But instead of that, you chose to make a mockery of justice, to shield his comfortable diaper bottom from the paddle swing of accountability, to soothe his conscience and remind him that he is actually just a ""good kid who just made a mistake.""

And because of that, you've all but assured he'll strike again. Only this time, he'll be an adult, and because of the media frenzy surrounding this case, he'll surely be looking at decades more in prison than he likely would've gotten if you'd advocated for a sentence of, say, 10-30 years. He will then die alone in prison surrounded by other inmates who watch the news, and despise sex offenders and child stranglers, begging for scraps of food in return for offering other inmates his cushy diapered bottom.

Yes, his life will be different now. Yes, he'll be universally despised. And he has to live with the fact that he's stained the family name and especially his own indefinitely.

But that is only because of **his** choices, and **his** crimes against humanity. Not the victim for reporting him, the media for covering the case, or breadtube/ConTalk for bashing him. It’s **HIS** fault. And just because his post-sentence life will suck, doesn't mean he should be spared a well-deserved jail sentence or a life on the sex offender list.

But you've made your choice. It's him over the victims.

So let me offer you some advice, to just MAYBE minimize Jesse's chances of relapsing.

I would say that you should deliberately fail him out of the youthful offender program, but that would be too painful *for him (never mind the women he raped and strangled).*

Instead, let me offer you this advice:

\-Get him Covenant Eyes or a program like it so you and his probation officer can monitor and control his devices. **This lasts until he has fifteen years clean of any non-consensual sexual activity, violence, or pornography.**

\-**Require him to pay restitution to his victims up front.** Maybe not even the full amount; maybe you as the family can cover some of it. But make the amount he has to pay sting him into young adulthood. Even if it means you garnish his wages and he doesn't get to move out on his own as quickly.

\-Ground him to the house. **No going outside unsupervised, no college experience, no going to the skating rink or the bowling alley, and no fun times without your approval. And keep the approved fun times to a minimum. This lasts until he has fifteen years clean of any non-consensual sexual activity, violence, or pornography.**

\-**Get him into the best therapy program that will accept him**. This was already one of the requirements for him not to go to prison.

**-Get him into a church men's group.** MEN'S GROUP. NO WOMEN, NO CHILDREN. Only God knows if he's capable of repentance, but it's worth a shot since you decided prison was too harsh for him.

\-No cars, no credit/debit cards, no way for him to go places or hang out unsupervised.

**-No unsupervised hangout time, dates, or outings. He wants to get a coffee at Starbucks? Sorry Jesse-poo, Mommy or Daddy have to be with you. This lasts until he has fifteen years clean of any non-consensual sexual activity, violence, or pornography.**

\-He sneaks out? **Ask the parole board to revoke his program and send him to prison.**

**And get a woodchipper, just in case.**

I wasn’t supposed to notice it.

That’s the part that still makes my hands shake when I think about it. Because if I hadn’t been bored at 2:13 a.m., scrolling through archived creepypasta threads, I would’ve never clicked on a dead profile.

The username was **[deleted]**, but not in the normal way.

Usually, when a Reddit account is gone, everything about it is hollow—no karma, no posts, no comments. This one was different. It still had a join date.

**January 1, 1970.**

That’s impossible. Reddit didn’t exist then. Computers barely did.

At first, I assumed it was a glitch. Reddit has plenty of those. But when I hovered over the profile, my browser lagged. Not froze—*lagged*, like it was struggling to render something that didn’t want to be seen.

The profile picture finally loaded.

It was… me.

Not a selfie. Not a mirror shot. A candid photo of me sitting at my desk, hunched forward, lit only by the glow of my monitor. The same hoodie I was wearing right now. Same coffee stain on the sleeve.

I slammed my laptop shut.

I laughed. That nervous, stupid laugh people do when they’re trying to convince themselves nothing is wrong.

After a few minutes, curiosity won. It always does.

I opened the laptop again.

The profile had one post.

Just one.

The title read:

**“You’ll read this too late.”**

It was posted **six minutes from now**.

Reddit timestamps don’t do that. They don’t show future posts.

I refreshed the page. The timestamp stayed the same.

Heart pounding, I clicked it.

The post was short.

> If you’re reading this, you didn’t listen.
>
> You never do.
>
> Check your front door. Not the lock. The hinge.

I stared at the words, then at the time. Still six minutes ahead.

I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment. Third floor. The front door opens inward. The hinge faces inside.

I told myself not to move.

I moved anyway.

The apartment was silent except for the low hum of my fridge. I crouched near the door, feeling ridiculous, and leaned close to the hinge.

There was something carved into the metal.

Tiny letters, scratched deep.

**1970**

My phone vibrated.

Reddit notification.

The post updated.

> You found it.
>
> Good. That means you’re still on schedule.

My stomach dropped.

I ran back to my desk and refreshed the profile. A new comment had appeared—posted by the same account.

**Replying to me.**

> You’re wondering how this works.
>
> It’s simple. Every time you read this account, you make it real.

I typed a reply without thinking.

*What do you want?*

The response came instantly.

> To exist.
>
> I only get time when someone notices me.

My lights flickered.

Just once. Enough to make my breath catch.

I looked back at the screen. Another paragraph appeared, letter by letter, like someone was typing it live.

> There used to be thousands of us.
>
> Forgotten usernames. Abandoned threads. Stories no one finished reading.
>
> Most of us faded.
>
> But you’re good at finishing things.

The cursor blinked in the reply box.

Then my keyboard started typing on its own.

*I don’t want this.*

> You already chose.
>
> You checked the hinge.

I heard it then.

A soft metallic *creak* behind me.

Not the door opening.

The hinge moving.

I spun around.

The front door was still closed—but the screws were slowly turning, backing themselves out, one by one, like something on the other side was carefully disassembling it.

My laptop chimed again.

> Last step.
>
> Let me borrow your name.

I don’t remember standing up. I don’t remember backing away. I only remember the sudden weight in my chest, like something was pressing outward from my ribs, trying to breathe *through* me.

The profile refreshed.

The username changed.

It wasn’t **[deleted]** anymore.

It was mine.

Same spelling. Same numbers. Same account age.

A final line appeared in the post.

> Thank you for logging in.

The door hinge snapped.

And now, if you’re reading this—
check the timestamp.

If it’s a few minutes ahead of you,
don’t look at the hinge.

1pr7puv,https://www.inkitt.com/stories/1618824,"An Open Letter to Jesse Mack Butler, from an actually promising young man with privilege who DOESN'T rape and strangle women.","To the family of Jesse Mack Butler,

I am writing this open letter because I share roughly the same age group as your \[insert relationship to JMB here\]. **I'm a young adult male as well, and I live in a town like yours, with a nationally recognized university, an award-winning high school, and a close sense of community.** I've grown up with some level of privilege as well; despite being only 24 years old at time of writing, I rub shoulders with mayors, community leaders, university staff, churches, and even a state rep or two. I played very little sport in high school and virtually none in college, but I used the same locker rooms as star athletes during gym class.

The point is, I understand how much community, school, and sports mean to towns like Stillwater Oklahoma, or Bourbonnais Illinois. And I understand how privilege can give you the wrong idea about life at times; *indeed, I've gotten a lot more passes in life than I probably deserved.*

I also understand what it means to be a promising young man, loaded with book smarts, good looks, and a vibrant friend group.

I further understand what it's like to be taken in by the world of internet smut; some of the stuff I've seen over the years would make older generations puke.

In a sense, Jesse and I have a lot in common. We've both been described as good, if somewhat flawed, kids with promising futures.

1pr7p50,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1pr7p50/hey_that_sam_altman_video_got_me_thinking/,"Hey, That Sam Altman Video Got Me Thinking...","Okay, I just watched this video by Sean Morrow about Sam Altman and OpenAI, and wow—it really stuck with me. I'm no expert on tech or finance (I still struggle with my own budget sometimes), but Morrow breaks it down in a way that makes you go, ""Wait, is this all too good to be true?"" He’s pretty critical, calling out Altman’s history and the huge risks we’re all taking on AI. As of today—December 20, 2025—things have moved fast since that video came out. OpenAI’s blowing up even more, but the concerns Morrow raised? They’re still hanging around. Let me walk you through it like I’m explaining it to a friend over coffee: the hype, the worries, the good stuff, the bad, and what Altman’s like in all this.

Altman’s Big Vision: Fixing the World with AI

Sam Altman’s pitch hasn’t changed much. He’s all about how super-advanced AI will solve everything—cancer, climate change, poverty, you name it. We’ll have endless cheap energy, everyone gets rich, jobs evolve into something better. Sounds amazing, right? Who wouldn’t want that? In return, though, we’re pouring insane resources into it: electricity, water for cooling servers, our data (like everything on Reddit), and trillions in spending.
Back when Morrow made the video, OpenAI was talking about $13 billion in yearly revenue but committing to over $1 trillion in infrastructure spend. That math felt off—like promising a mansion on a burger-flipper salary. Fast forward to now: OpenAI’s revenue has exploded to over $20 billion annualized this year, way up from earlier estimates. They’re on track for hundreds of billions by 2030, Altman says. And those spending commitments? Still massive—around $1.4 trillion locked in for data centers and chips. They’re raising huge money too, talking about a new round that could value the company at $750-830 billion. Crazy growth, but it’s still a gigantic bet.

Altman’s Past: A Pattern of ""Trust Me""?

Morrow digs into Altman’s history, and it’s... interesting. His first app, Loopt, got hyped with fake user numbers, sold off quick, and poof—gone. Then at Y Combinator, he promised no conflicts but invested personally in the startups he oversaw. OpenAI started as a nonprofit ""for humanity,"" but flipped to for-profit, looping billions back to investors like Microsoft and Nvidia.
Altman says he owns no equity in OpenAI and takes barely a salary—pure mission-driven guy. But he’s invested in nuclear companies like Helion (fusion) and Oklo (mini reactors—he stepped down as chair earlier this year to avoid conflicts). Worldcoin, his crypto/eye-scan thing for UBI and ID? Still controversial, with privacy issues in some countries.
In person (or in interviews), Altman comes off confident, sometimes defensive—like snapping at that interviewer about shares. Morrow calls it a series of ""just trust me, bro"" moments. Fair? Maybe. He’s a dealmaker, not a pure scientist, and he’s delivered huge wins. But when questioned hard, he can get prickly.

The Good Side: This Stuff Is Actually Changing Lives

Let’s be real—AI’s already pretty incredible. ChatGPT helps me brainstorm, write emails, even explain complicated stuff simply. Businesses are using it to boost productivity, doctors for research, kids for learning. OpenAI just rolled out newer models like GPT-5.2 for tough science/math work and better image generation. If they hit AGI (super-smart AI), it could unlock cures and abundance like Altman promises. Nuclear bets could mean clean, endless power. And yeah, job shifts might come with UBI ideas. It’s exciting—tech has surprised us positively before.

The Bad Side and Future Worries

But here’s where Morrow’s video hits hard: the risks. AI guzzles energy—like, plans for gigawatts that could power whole countries. Water use, rare metals, environmental impact. Jobs disappearing fast without real safety nets (that Reddit promise never happened). Deepfakes, scams—Altman’s invested in fixes, but prevention first? Data scraping without always paying creators fairly.
If it flops? Massive waste, economic hit (much of recent growth tied to AI spend). Taxpayers might bail it out, as hinted. Competition’s fierce—Google, Anthropic closing in. And power concentration: one company (and one guy) holding so much sway.
As of late 2025, sentiment’s cooled a bit—investors questioning if the spending bubble holds. But OpenAI keeps shipping: new apps, Disney deals for video, enterprise tools. Valuation skyrocketing shows belief’s still there.

My Take: Exciting, But Let’s Not Blindly Trust


Look, I’m optimistic about tech, but Morrow’s video made me pause. Altman’s delivered growth that’s mind-blowing, but his track record has fibs and flips. We’re betting society’s future on in these promises. Should we demand more transparency, regulations, fair sharing of benefits?
I don’t think it’s all doom—AI’s potential is real. But maybe slower, safer, with more voices at the table. What do you guys think? Have you felt AI helping your life, or are the downsides worrying you more? Hit me with your thoughts—I’m genuinely curious.",0,1766212263.0,ChatGPT,10,0.42,False

But because you made a sweetheart deal with another privileged family likely full of young men with the same promising future of sexual and physical violence without any input from the victims or their families, in six months the conviction won't even appear on Jesse's record. He won't even have to notify future partners that he's an attempted murderer and rapist. He'll never spend a day behind bars until/unless he fulfills his promise, **which I fear will mean producing more victims, and this time silencing his victims by finishing the job he failed to do with either of his child victims and murdering them.**

I understand that you love Jesse dearly, and feel the need to stick up for your \[insert relationship here\]. That's what families are for, right?

But there are other ways to be there for your \[insert relationship here\] that don't involve excusing his behavior, taking selfies of him rocking Gucci shades in the courtroom waiting area, bonding him out of jail after he raped and strangled women, and negotiating a corrupt bargain behind closed doors while the victims are shut out of the discussion.

For example, you could've visited Jesse in prison. You could've advocated for Jesse to get therapy as part of his sentencing, including family therapy. You could've advocated for him to get 10 years, 20 years, or 30 years, instead of 78. When he got out, you could've driven him to meetings with his parole officer, taken him to his monthly sex registration appointments and cried in the lobby while he registered his name and address and had his mugshot taken wishing things had gone differently, started a small business where Jesse could be employed and work to pay off his restitution (which I know you can do because you practically run the town), or used some of your connections to get Jesse a job. You could've acted as accountability partners to ensure Jesse complies with his registry requirements and stays off social media and pornography sites.

But instead of that, you chose to make a mockery of justice, to shield his comfortable diaper bottom from the paddle swing of accountability, to soothe his conscience and remind him that he is actually just a ""good kid who just made a mistake.""

And because of that, you've all but assured he'll strike again. Only this time, he'll be an adult, and because of the media frenzy surrounding this case, he'll surely be looking at decades more in prison than he likely would've gotten if you'd advocated for a sentence of, say, 10-30 years. He will then die alone in prison surrounded by other inmates who watch the news, and despise sex offenders and child stranglers, begging for scraps of food in return for offering other inmates his cushy diapered bottom.

Yes, his life will be different now. Yes, he'll be universally despised. And he has to live with the fact that he's stained the family name and especially his own indefinitely.

But that is only because of **his** choices, and **his** crimes against humanity. Not the victim for reporting him, the media for covering the case, or breadtube/ConTalk for bashing him. It’s **HIS** fault. And just because his post-sentence life will suck, doesn't mean he should be spared a well-deserved jail sentence or a life on the sex offender list.

But you've made your choice. It's him over the victims.

So let me offer you some advice, to just MAYBE minimize Jesse's chances of relapsing.

I would say that you should deliberately fail him out of the youthful offender program, but that would be too painful *for him (never mind the women he raped and strangled).*

Instead, let me offer you this advice: 

\-Get him Covenant Eyes or a program like it so you and his probation officer can monitor and control his devices.   **This lasts until he has fifteen years clean of any non-consensual sexual activity, violence, or pornography.** 

\-**Require him to pay restitution to his victims up front.** Maybe not even the full amount; maybe you as the family can cover some of it. But make the amount he has to pay sting him into young adulthood. Even if it means you garnish his wages and he doesn't get to move out on his own as quickly.

\-Ground him to the house. **No going outside unsupervised, no college experience, no going to the skating rink or the bowling alley, and no fun times without your approval. And keep the approved fun times to a minimum. This lasts until he has fifteen years clean of any non-consensual sexual activity, violence, or pornography.**

\-**Get him into the best therapy program that will accept him**. This was already one of the requirements for him not to go to prison.

**-Get him into a church men's group.** MEN'S GROUP. NO WOMEN, NO CHILDREN. Only God knows if he's capable of repentance, but it's worth a shot since you decided prison was too harsh for him.

\-No cars, no credit/debit cards, no way for him to go places or hang out unsupervised.

**-No unsupervised hangout time, dates, or outings. He wants to get a coffee at Starbucks? Sorry Jesse-poo, Mommy or Daddy have to be with you. This lasts until he has fifteen years clean of any non-consensual sexual activity, violence, or pornography.**

\-He sneaks out? **Ask the parole board to revoke his program and send him to prison.**

**And get a woodchipper, just in case.**

Does this work out? I’ve searched through all the books I have saved but I don’t find anything about it (or the symbolism behind it that explains why a cross candle is used in this kind of ritual?)

Indeed, I saw it being used to make “return to me” spells too?

1pr7n1q,https://v.redd.it/suk5t9s7za8g1,The Night My Friend and I Went Skinwalker Hunting in New Mexico…,"Also video might be loud so yall can hear the “hey!”

This was a few months ago. I was fifteen, a sophomore in high school. Living in this tiny-ass desert town in New Mexico, one of those forgotten spots where the pavement just quits on you without any goddamn warning, and suddenly you’re kicking up dust on dirt roads that stretch out forever. Dust gets everywhere, man, in your teeth, grinding like sandpaper every time you swallow; in your clothes, turning everything a faded brown; in your lungs, making every breath feel a little heavier, a little drier. The mesas out there on the horizon, they’re like these massive, ancient beasts frozen in mid-collapse, all red and jagged against the endless blue sky during the day, but at night… at night, they just loom, silent and watchful. It’s the kind of town where nothing ever happens, right? Like, the biggest news is when someone’s truck breaks down or a coyote snatches a chicken. So when something does go down, everyone knows your name by morning. Hell, they probably know what you had for breakfast too.
Skinwalker stories? Yeah, they were always floating around like background static. You’d hear ‘em from the older guys leaning against their tailgates at the gas station, spitting chew and drawling about shadows that move wrong. Or your half-drunk uncles around the campfire, eyes glassy from beer, spinning yarns to scare the shit out of the kids. Cousins pulling pranks, whispering in the dark to freak you out. But nobody actually believed them. Not really. I mean, come on, shape-shifters? Demons wearing animal skins? It was just folklore, something to pass the time in a place where time drags like a bad hangover. I sure as hell didn’t believe it.
Not until that weekend right before Thanksgiving.
My parents leaving me home alone… man, it felt way bigger than it should’ve. I stood there in the driveway, watching their taillights fade into the dust cloud kicking up behind their SUV, just staring longer than necessary, as if I blinked they’d come back or something. The house behind me went dead quiet after the engine noise died out, it wasn’t peaceful silence, nah, it felt like something essential had been unplugged, leaving this hollow buzz in the air. The keys in my pocket? They felt heavier than keys should, pressing against my thigh like a reminder of all the dumb shit I could get into. No license yet, but total freedom. No adults breathing down my neck. My brain was firing on all cylinders, thoughts piling up and overlapping, should I raid the fridge? Watch whatever the hell I want on TV? Sneak out? My feet were tapping restlessly, pacing back and forth on the cracked concrete, stopping, starting again. ADHD brain buzzing like a live wire, jumping from one idea to the next without landing anywhere solid.
I wasn’t throwing a party or anything. That’s not my style, too chaotic, too many variables I couldn’t control. But I texted Liam anyway. Figured it’d be low-key, just us hanging out, maybe play some video games or bullshit about school.
When his truck pulled up later that evening, the dogs lost their shit instantly. Deep, angry barking ripping through the quiet, hackles up like spines on a pissed-off porcupine. My two big black German Shepherds, Sadie and her brother Max, slammed into the chain-link fence like they were trying to bulldoze right through it, paws scraping metal, teeth flashing in the headlights. And Tripp, my blue heeler, yeah, that’s me naming the dog after myself, don’t judge, he was circling fast, nails scraping the dirt, whining low in his throat like he sensed something off before we even did. Dust rolled thick under Liam’s headlights, swirling like smoke in the beams.
Liam stepped out slowly, no hurry in his movements. Big frame, broad shoulders that filled out his button-up shirt, jeans faded from real work, not some store-bought distress. Cowboy hat like it was glued to his head, shadowing his face just enough to make him look even more unflappable. He didn’t rush over or anything, never did. Just shut the door with a solid thunk, adjusted his hat brim with one hand, scanned the yard once like he was clocking all the exits without even thinking about it. A quiet smile tugged at his mouth. Calm. The kind of calm that seeps into you, makes you feel like maybe everything’s fine, even when your gut’s telling you it’s not.
Me? I’m 5’10”, short blonde hair that’s almost bleached-looking from all the sun out here beating down on it, athletic build from baseball, lean muscle, quick feet that can pivot on a dime, sharp eyes that catch details fast. Always moving, energy never shuts off. Restless as hell, ADHD keeping me fidgety, but it’s what makes me charismatic too, people say I light up a room without trying, drawing folks in with that fast-talking vibe. I’m a fast thinker, instinct-driven, protective of my group like a damn guard dog myself. Smart, but not in a bookish way, more reaction-based, great at reading danger and acting on it immediately. And yeah, I’m a surprisingly good planner when it counts, mapping routes in my head, organizing supply runs, working with everyone to combine strengths so shit doesn’t fall apart.
Liam’s the opposite of all that chaos in me, solid, grounded, country-smart. Strategic without ever announcing it, like he thinks three steps ahead but keeps it to himself. Loyal as hell, quiet unless he’s got something worth saying. Physically powerful, the kind of strong that doesn’t need proving, gun expert, mechanic skills that rival adults, fixing engines like it’s no big deal. We’ve got this balance, you know? My high-energy buzz and his steady calm.
Inside the house, we kicked back with pizza, greasy slices from the frozen ones I nuked in the oven, cheese stringing everywhere. Laughed about dumb shit from school, teachers we hated, that one kid who wrecked his dirt bike last week. But the dogs… they paced nonstop, nails ticking against the tile floor like a goddamn countdown timer. Tripp kept circling the living room, ears perked, glancing at the windows every few seconds. Sadie and Max weren’t much better, whining softly and sticking close, like they were on edge about something we couldn’t see.
I joked, half-joking, half-testing the air, my voice a little too loud to cover the nerves bubbling up, about “skinwalker hunting” out back. You know, grab some gear and poke around the mesa, see if those old stories had any teeth. My brain was already racing ahead, planning it out: what to bring, which path to take, how to stay safe without admitting we might need to.
Liam didn’t laugh. Didn’t brush it off or call it stupid. He just nodded once, really deliberately.
“Yeah,” he said, voice low and even. “I’m in.”
Something about how easily he said it, zero hesitation, made my stomach tighten, like a knot pulling taut. But fuck it, right? We were just messing around.
We grabbed gear quick. My shitty .22 rifle, light, cheap as hell, only seven rounds in the magazine, but it felt better than nothing in my hands. Liam’s 9mm pistol, holstered on his belt as it belonged there, no fanfare. Flashlights, mine was a cheap LED that flickered if you shook it too hard, his was a heavy-duty one that cut through the dark like a knife. Spirit box apps downloaded on our phones, crackling with static when we tested ’em. An EMF reader app too, the kind ghost hunters swear by, screen glowing green in the dim kitchen light. The dogs followed without question, Sadie and Max flanking us like bodyguards, Tripp darting ahead, tail wagging but eyes alert.
Out on the mesa, the darkness swallowed us whole. No moon that night, just stars punched sharp into the sky like a million tiny holes letting in cold light from somewhere else. The air was crisp, biting at my exposed skin, carrying that faint scent of sage and dry earth. But the dark didn’t feel empty, it felt occupied. Heavy, pressing in from all sides like it had weight. Our flashlights barely scratched it, thin cones of light shaking in my hands as my ADHD kept me sweeping left, right, up, down, never settling. Every step crunched under our boots, gravel and dirt shifting, and I could hear my own breathing, ragged and too loud in my ears.
We found a clearing after hiking maybe fifteen minutes, a flat dirt patch, scattered rocks like forgotten bones, wind brushing through the dry grass like something breathing slow and steady. My heart was already picking up speed, thumping against my ribs, but I played it cool, setting up like this was no big deal. Liam was steady as ever, checking his pistol once, eyes scanning the perimeter without a word.
We started with the Estes Method. Liam popped in his earbuds, connected to the spirit box app blasting random radio snippets, eyes down, totally blind to what I asked. He sat on a rock, hat tipped back slightly, big frame hunched forward like he was listening to a secret. I couldn’t stop scanning, left, right, behind us, flashlight beam jerking erratically. My brain wouldn’t shut the fuck up: What if something’s out there? Nah, it’s nothing. But what if? Feet shifting, restless, quick feet ready to bolt if needed. I made sure Liam was scared, telling him. “You know what would be funny, if there’s a skinwalker watching us right now, anywhere and we can’t stop it or even see it.”

Later, when we talked about it, Liam said he felt a tapping on his shoulder earlier, right as we settled in. Light, insistent, like fingers poking. I didn’t see anything. Didn’t hear anything. Skeptical as hell, but I didn’t say shit, just nodded, protective instinct kicking in, not wanting to freak him out more.
I cleared my throat, voice a little shaky but pushing through. “Y-yeah, we’re gonna do this. Is there anybody out there watching?”
Liam paused, head tilted slightly, like he was straining through noise.
Then, real quiet, his voice flat but edged with something: “Who touched me earlier… I felt it when I was standing back there.”
My chest dropped like I missed a step on the stairs, heart slamming harder. The wind picked up just then, rustling the bushes nearby, making shadows dance in the flashlight beam.
He added, still quiet, “I don’t mind it. I’m just curious.”
My mouth ran ahead of my brain, always does when I’m wired like this. “Yee naaldlooshii,” I yelled, my voice echoing too loud off the mesas, bouncing back distorted. “Oh, don’t do that shit. You don’t scare us.”
I laughed, but it came out wrong. Tight. Cracked, like glass about to shatter. “Y’all ain’t over there, dude.”
Liam tilted his head further, like he was listening through thick static, brow furrowing under his hat.
“I swear to God,” he said slowly, drawing out the words, “I heard disrespect… Yeah. I heard disrespect.”
“What?” I said, voice cracking a bit, sharp eyes darting to the edges of the clearing.
Then, barely audible, I whispered to myself, “Wait… what if it just said ‘Don’t disrespect him’?”
Silence slammed down hard. Like the desert leaned in closer, holding its breath with us. The stars seemed brighter, colder. My skin prickled, every hair standing up, and I swept the flashlight again, beam trembling more now.
The EMF app on my phone showed nothing, no spikes, just flat green. Liam yanked his earbuds out, shaking his head like he was clearing fog.
“Whoa… No. I thought that glowing thing was a moth, I did see a moth,” he muttered, voice low, like normal words might fix whatever the hell was building.
“I only got like seven rounds in this .22 anyway,” I said, trying to sound casual, gripping the rifle tighter, fingers slick with sudden sweat. “Even a 9 mil isn’t much out here.”
A twig snapped, sharp, close, like a bone breaking.
All three dogs froze. Every muscle locked tight. No growling. No barking. Just pure alert, ears forward, bodies rigid as statues. Tripp’s whine cut off mid-note, and Sadie and Max stood in the dark.
Liam whispered, breath visible in the cold air, “I heard that… felt like a deer. My heart’s pounding, I feel like darting.”
My throat went dry, mouth tasted like dust. Suspense hung thick, every second stretching, my brain mapping escape routes instinctively, back the way we came, cut left around that rock pile, guns up.
We tried to be respectful after that, my protective side kicking in hard. Liam said, “We should probably try to be respectful, though. These guys have gone through enough.”
Then softer, almost reverent: “I appreciate whoever’s communicating… thanks for talking with us.”
I nodded, quick feet shifting. “Let’s hold our breath. Try to hear something… anything.”
We stood dead still. Holding our breath like hunters in a blind, lungs burning after ten seconds, fifteen, twenty. My ears rang with the silence, sharp eyes straining into the black, waiting for any rustle, any whisper.
“Is there anybody out there?” I called, voice steadier now, but echoing back lonely.
Nothing on the EMF, still flat.
“I thought it spiked hard when that moth flew by,” Liam said, glancing at my phone.
“No,” he added, shaking his head. “It was a tiny little one. I wouldn’t count it.”
I started whistling without thinking, a nervous habit, high-pitched and uneven, trying to fill the void.
Liam snapped, voice firm but not mean, “Maybe not whistle anymore. Let’s not push it.”
We climbed onto a flat rock nearby, scrambling up the rough surface. Three feet higher, but it felt safer, like elevation mattered out here, giving us a vantage point. I said it out loud, voice a touch stammering from the adrenaline. “I-I feel way better up here, good three feet higher, we can see more.”
Liam sat at the edge, earbuds back in, head down, big frame steady as a boulder. I swept the area nonstop with his flashlight, heart pounding in my ears like a drum, beam cutting through the night, catching glints off rocks that looked too much like eyes at first glance.
I shone the light toward the bushes, dense, tangled shadows, and said, stupid, cocky, defensive, words tumbling out fast: “We’re protected… You can’t get me… I’m protected by God… you’re evil, you’re a demon.”
The spirit box hit Liam hard then.
He jolted upright, eyes wide like he’d been slapped awake, hat nearly tipping off.
“Whoa… it just said ‘we were two.’ Really clear. Like crystal clear.”
My blood turned to ice, veins freezing up, sharp eyes widening. “What about that?” I asked, voice low, instinct telling me to stay quiet now.
He didn’t hear me, earbuds in deep.
Then he yelled, sudden and sharp: “What the hell was that?!”
I snapped my flashlight down—Sadie walked past his leg, tail low.
“It’s my dog. Huh, Sadie.”
Then—
“Hey!”
Distant. Calm. Human. Floating out from the northeast, clear as a bell but wrong in the silence.
“What the fuck was that?!” I gasped, voice breaking, high-energy turning to panic. I started kicking Liam’s back hard with my boot, protective urge surging—get up, we gotta move. “Liam! Okay…okay… ”
He ripped the earbuds out, jumping to his feet, pistol in hand fast, with gun expert reflexes. “What what what?!”
I aimed my rifle northeast, hands shaking so bad I could feel the stock vibrating against my shoulder, quick feet planting firm. The suspense clawed at me, every bush rustling in the wind sounding like footsteps now.
Minutes dragged by, felt like hours, time stretching thin. The dogs were glued to us, Tripp pressing against my leg, whining softly.
“I took my hood off so I can hear better,” Liam said, voice steady but eyes scanning hard. “It was faint before.”
“I—I was kicking you earlier,” I stammered, admitting it, words rushing. “That’s what scared me most. You said you heard something. I heard it too. Down that way. Like faint yelling.”
I scanned again, beam jerking.
“Over there,” Liam whispered, pointing with his free hand.
“When you moved it like that,” he said, voice dropping lower, “I saw a little dot. Like eyes reflecting. Down by those bushes.”
“Could be my dogs…” I said, but my voice didn’t believe me, sharp eyes straining to see.
“No,” he insisted, country-smart certainty in his tone. “Lower. Right at the tip of the bushes.”
That was it. No arguing. No debate. My planning brain kicked in, route back mapped: straight south, stick to the path, guns ready, dogs close. We left, steps quick but not running, every crunch underfoot echoing too loud.
Every step felt watched, hairs on my neck standing, instinct screaming eyes on us from the dark. The road toward my house came into view slowly, lights from the porch a faint beacon, and I whispered, “I think something’s headed toward the house… those lights?”
Then my neighbor’s UTV burst out from by their pond, headlights blinding us like spotlights, engine roaring. We waved like idiots, hands up, squinting. Talked for twenty minutes just to feel human again, bullshitting about the weather, trucks, anything normal. Liam’s mechanic skills came up, him chatting easily about fixing engines, me fidgeting but forcing a laugh.
Halfway home after that, pushing through the last stretch. 
That metallic bark. Distorted. Wrong. Like a machine pretending to remember how dogs sound, echo-y, echoing weirdly off the mesas.
We moved fast now, guns ready, checking every shadow that shifted. My quick feet leading, protective of Liam and the dogs, brain racing: get inside, lock up, review footage.
Inside at last. Doors slammed. Locked tight. Dogs piled against us on the couch, panting, eyes still alert.
We hooked my phone to the TV, sat there in the bright living room light, reviewing the footage. Heart still pounding, ice cream straight from the tub, chocolate chip cookie dough, spooned in big bites to calm the nerves.
On the TV, loud and unmistakable, 
“Hey…”
Chills racing down my spine, hair standing again.
On Snapchat, almost pure black, just shaky flashlight sweeps from my trembling hands. We maxed the brightness and volume, replaying slow.
Right before I started freaking out on camera, there it was. Calm. Human. Floating in the background.
“Hey…”
We replayed it over and over: “Hey…” Getting louder each time in our heads, until we muted it, staring at each other wide-eyed.
And as I panned the phone, two glowing eyes appeared only on replay, faint, but there, reflecting back. Liam described a low crouching shadow, darker than the brush, moving fast, ducking away like it knew we were looking. The dogs were right beside us the whole time, accounted for.
But the part that scared us shitless was the background audio as we started leaving—Hearing it through the TV speakers made the hair on our necks stand up. We replayed the “hey” a dozen times, volume cranked, until the room felt too small, too exposed.
We barely slept. Lights on all night, dogs inside piled on the couch with us, ice cream tub empty on the coffee table while we watched ghost videos till sunrise, like idiots trying to laugh it off, nervous chuckles that didn’t fool anyone. My brain is buzzing, restless, replaying every detail.
Months later, I still have the video.
Still no explanation.
Has anyone else ever caught something like this out in the desert? That darkness out there doesn’t fuck around.
I plan to go in a few days… with a heavier pack of guns and more friends…

Whenever I bring up how I’m feeling, he gets offended?? It’s like talking to a brick wall. I’m tired of asking things of husband and just being responsible for everything, emotionally and physically. I’ve lost my glow and I desperately need it back. I need my own space for a while so I applied for an apartment a few days ago and was approved. The lease is for a year. I told my husband today and I felt like he was trying to talk me out of moving. He brought up a lot of hypotheticals and said it‘s a bad idea. I reassured him that me moving out temporarily doesn’t mean I want a divorce or that I want to see other people or anything like that. I just want to try anything to get out of this horrible place in our marriage. I don’t like the person I’ve become and he doesn’t like who he’s become. He doesn't get it and believes things will end. He’s afraid of the unknown. Again, I reassured him that we will have a plan. I asked (begged) for his support and for him to just trust me. Him not supporting me is what I feel will end our marriage, not me moving out temporarily.

I have yet to sign the lease, but I’m feeling deep down like this needs to happen for us to heal and come back to one another. I feel like if I don’t do this, we’ll carry on the way we have been for the past few months. What do I do?",1,1766211938.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1766211613.0,FrostWire,0,1.0,False
