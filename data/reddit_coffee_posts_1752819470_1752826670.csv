Here are some expanded thoughts on how to nurture harmony in your relationship:

# Understanding the Root of Fights

Many marital conflicts arise from unmet needs, miscommunication, or unresolved past issues. Instead of focusing on who’s right or wrong, try to **dig deeper into the real problem**. For example, an argument about household chores might actually be about feeling **unappreciated or overburdened**. When you address the **underlying emotions** rather than just the surface issue, you create space for real solutions.

# The Power of Patience & Forgiveness

No marriage is perfect, and both partners will make mistakes. Holding onto grudges or bringing up past conflicts during new arguments only fuels resentment. Instead, **practice forgiveness**—not because the other person ""deserves"" it, but because you value your relationship more than your pride. Patience allows you to respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively in heated moments.

# Building a Culture of Appreciation

Over time, couples often take each other for granted, focusing more on flaws than on strengths. Make it a habit to **express gratitude daily**, whether for small acts (like making coffee) or bigger efforts (like emotional support). When both partners feel **valued and seen**, they’re less likely to engage in unnecessary conflicts.

# The Role of Humor & Lightness

A well-timed joke or playful comment can **diffuse tension** before it escalates. Couples who laugh together—even at their own mistakes—tend to navigate conflicts more smoothly. Of course, humor should never be used to mock or belittle, but when used kindly, it can remind you both that love is bigger than any disagreement.

# Knowing When to Let Go

Some arguments happen simply because one or both partners are tired, stressed, or hungry (the famous **""HALT"" rule**—never argue when you’re Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired). Sometimes, the best way to stop a fight is to **drop the topic, hug it out, and revisit it later** with a clearer mind.

# Growing Together, Not Apart

Marriage is a journey, and couples who **actively work on their bond**—through shared goals, open conversations, and mutual support—tend to fight less. Regular check-ins (like a weekly ""how are we doing?"" talk) can help address small issues before they become big battles.

# Final Thought: Love is a Choice

Every marriage has ups and downs, but **choosing love over ego, understanding over blame, and peace over winning** can transform conflicts into opportunities for deeper connection. Instead of asking, *""How can I stop fights?""* try asking, *""How can we grow stronger through this?""*

The precision of a quantum calculation? That’s the violin section, hitting each note with laser focus. The hum of a 3D printer laying down layers? The cellos, steady and grounding. The spark when a new app solves a lab problem? A sudden brass fanfare, loud and joyous. At r/SciTechSymphonyA, we’re here to conduct the chaos into harmony.​Think of the last time a breakthrough felt like music. Maybe it was when your code finally compiled, the screen lighting up like a conductor’s baton signaling the start. Or when a biotech device you designed began tracking patient data in real time, each beep a beat in a rhythm that might save lives. Science doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and tech isn’t just gadgets—it’s the way a machine learning algorithm can predict climate patterns, or how a CRISPR tool, paired with robotics, edits genes with the care of a pianist playing a sonata.​Here, we don’t silo “science” and “tech.” We mix them. Post the time your Arduino project helped automate a chemistry experiment (“Who knew a $20 board could replace 10 hours of stirring?”). Share the moment a neuroscience paper inspired your app’s new UI (“Turns out, the brain processes color like a well-tuned chorus—who knew?”). Rant about the glitch that crashed your simulation and your coffee cup (“Why does the code break only when I’m on my third espresso?”). Celebrate the “aha!” when a physics concept unlocked your engineering block (“Friction isn’t just a force—it’s the reason my drone kept nosediving. Duh.”).​This is where the lab coat meets the keyboard, where beakers dance with circuit boards. Whether you’re a biologist geeking out over AI, a coder fascinated by quantum physics, or just someone who thinks “sci-tech” sounds like the coolest band name ever—you belong. Bring your half-baked ideas (“What if we used plant DNA to encrypt data?”), your failed experiments (“My solar-powered microscope works… until it rains”), and your wildest “what-ifs.” Together, we’ll turn the clangs and buzzes of innovation into something beautiful.​Welcome to the symphony.

1m2wmwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/PedroPeepos/comments/1m2wmwe/fellow_rat_tries_to_break_into_league_esports/,Fellow rat tries to break into League Esports,"Heeey rats,

So I’ve been a fan of League since the early days (even though I’m not exactly unc age I’m 24). It’s always been a dream of mine to work in the League esports scene, either in the LEC or for a team org. The problem is, coming from the Balkans, there are barely any opportunities, and it’s really hard to break in.
I’ve always wanted to ask where LoL teams even post job ads, but every time I brought it up, I got the same answer: “Bro it’s impossible, don’t even bother.”
But now, since the Rat King himself has his own team, I wanna ask you directly, Caedrel: Where do you post job ads for your team? Because honestly, I’d do anything to be part of the scene especially for a team I already cheer for. I don’t care if it’s social media, editing clips, coding random tools, making memes, or even just running to get coffee.
Not gonna lie, I’m kinda scared because time keeps flying by, and it feels like the older I get, the more this becomes a distant dream instead of something real. But I’m still here, rat heart beating strong, ready to send CVs, make content . So please, help a fellow rat out. I’m a rat of many talents — mainly programming, and right now I’m working as a game tester — but for esports, I’m literally ready to do anything. Seriously, I don’t even care about the money at this point (even though I’m a broke boi) All I want is to help, create, and be part of something I’ve loved for so long. Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED talk. If anyone especially you, Caedrel has advice or can point me in the right direction, it’d mean the world. ❤️🐀

1m2wlo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dental_Art_Clinic/comments/1m2wlo9/the_secret_to_an_instantly_better_smile_without/,The Secret to an Instantly Better Smile (Without Veneers),"Ever wondered how to fix a small tooth chip or gap without going all-in on veneers? One popular solution in cosmetic dentistry is [composite bonding](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/composite-bonding). It’s a quick, painless, and **cost-effective alternative to** [veneers ](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/veneers)that’s become *super* popular here in London. For those unfamiliar, composite bonding (aka *dental bonding*) involves applying a tooth-colored resin to your teeth to repair minor flaws and enhance your smile’s appearance. The best part? It often only takes **one visit** to the dentist, so you can walk out with a refreshed smile in no time!

**What Makes Composite Bonding Awesome?** Here are some key benefits that have Londoners raving about this treatment:

* **Quick Results (One-Visit Smile Upgrade):** The whole process is usually done in a single appointment, often in under an hour. Perfect for busy schedules – you could literally get a tooth fixed on your lunch break. Instant gratification!
* **Painless & Non-Invasive:** No drills, no needles (in most cases). The dentist just lightly preps the tooth surface and adds the resin. It’s generally **painless**, so if dental work makes you nervous, bonding is pretty stress-free. Plus, since there’s minimal to no enamel removal, your natural tooth stays intact.
* **Affordable Alternative to Veneers:** Want the aesthetic boost of veneers but not the hefty price tag? Composite bonding is **much more budget-friendly**. You get similar cosmetic improvements (covering discoloration, smoothing chips, closing small gaps) at a fraction of the cost of porcelain veneers. **Bonus:** It’s reversible, unlike veneers which permanently alter your teeth.
* **Fixes Chips, Gaps & Other Flaws:** Bonding is super versatile. It can repair a chipped tooth, fill in a slight gap between teeth, mask small cracks or spots, and even make a slightly crooked tooth look straighter. It’s basically a cosmetic touch-up that can make your teeth look more even and bright.
* **Boosts Smile Aesthetics (and Confidence):** By improving tooth shape and color, composite bonding can dramatically enhance your smile’s appearance. Many patients say it gives them a **big confidence boost** – you’ll find yourself smiling more when you’re not worried about that one annoying chip or uneven tooth! 🎉

**Why** ***London*** **Loves Composite Bonding:** Aside from the benefits above, composite bonding fits the London vibe perfectly. It’s **quick, effective, and readily available** at many cosmetic dental clinics here (including ours at [Dental Art Implant Clinic](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/composite-bonding)). We’ve seen first-hand how a bit of bonding can transform someone’s smile *in one day*. In a city where everyone’s busy and quality matters, this treatment has become a go-to for a subtle but impactful smile makeover. And yes, it’s great for that tea or coffee staining habit – bonding can cover up discoloration and give you a fresh start (just remember to still go easy on the lattes to keep it looking its best! 😉).

**Let’s Chat!** Have you had any experience with composite bonding or other cosmetic dental work in London? **What do you think of it?** If you’re curious or have questions about how composite bonding works, what it costs around here, or whether it’s the right fix for your teeth – ask away in the comments! 💬 As dental professionals, we’re happy to share honest advice and info. Whether you’re contemplating a minor tweak or just love learning about dental stuff, we’d love to hear your thoughts and answer your questions.

1m2wl9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m2wl9q/i_miss_my_grandfather/,I miss my grandfather,"I have never had a tragic loss. Not like some of my friends where family members have died young or in an unexpected way.

And when my grandpa died, we knew it was happening. He had been in pain for years but  when he started being confused thats when we knew it was happening. The last time I saw him I'm not sure he recognized me. 

So naturally I was sad when he died. But overtime thebgrief became less frequent. Which is normal, I think.

Now its about 5/6 years later. (He died the summer before covid)

And from time to time i have a memory of him and then I remember I will never see him again. He will never spend the day on the balcony to make sure he sees my car pulling up to open the door before I can even ring the bell. 
And he will never ""secretly"" pass me 100 bucks even though grandma already gave me 50 for gas. 
And he will never see me graduated and thriving. He has never met his grandchildren. And I will never hug him again. And he will never curse at the tv, and he will never read to my children like he read to me and will not see me get married and he will never tell my grandma to sit down after lunch whole he makes her coffee and does the dishes. He will never go to the theater again. He will never walk past a church again, feeling sad about how they shunned him and then tell my grandma that she was worth it. He will never meet his brothers for their yearly reunion again. Never donate a day late to the christmas childrens charity. He will never tell me to get in the car and then drive me somewhere beautiful. 
I hope he knew how much i loved him because I definitely didnt tell him often enough. 

And i get so incredibly sad about that. I fall into these fits of crying and then im melancholic for a little while. 

Once I made the mistake of telling a friend about that. She felt I was insensitive because she lost a grandma to alzheimers. So it was years of suffering not just for her grandma but for the entire family dealing with it...

So now I dont talk about it anymore. And it really isnt so bad because most of the times thinking about him is a good happy thing. 

But today was another day of missing him. For context the last day was a few months ago. So it really doesnt happen a lot that i cry about it...

1m2whii,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2whii,AIO so called friend sees me getting help for anxiety and immediately weaponizes said anxiety,"“I (21M) go to a prestigious private university. My friend Bobby has known about my mental health struggles since freshman year - he was actually there when I first realized I might need help (couldn’t enter a building due to anxiety). Initially seemed supportive.

Fast forward to now: I sent him a pic of my prescribed Zoloft. I’ve been taking the time this summer to work out my mental health issues with a psychologist and got referred to a psychiatrist for anxiety. His response was to tell me I don’t actually have mental health problems, I’m ‘dragging it,’ then immediately brought up my most embarrassing social interaction. I actually called him immediately and he began berating me and downed me for seeing a girl who goes to a nearby university, asking if she was dumb and saying stuff like “we can’t be doing ___ uni in 2025”. He even told me the girl texted him that directly and he replied with “I believe it”. I cannot wrap my head around these levels of nefariousness.

Context: I once complimented a woman’s dress at a late-night diner and she seemed uncomfortable. I said ‘I like your dress’ and left when she awkwardly said thanks and seemed weirded out.

Bobby’s been escalating this pattern - recently replied ‘you’re mentally insane’ to a random tweet I made about there not being much a joint and a coffee can’t fix.

I know many people complain about Keurig coffee tasting watery or bland, but there are several tricks to make it taste amazing.

First, let's talk about the machine itself. I personally use the Keurig K-Elite, which I got from here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers. It's been a game-changer for my morning routine.

The secret to better-tasting Keurig coffee starts with regular maintenance. I clean my machine monthly using vinegar or descaling solution. This removes mineral buildup that can affect taste. Also, always use fresh, filtered water - it makes a huge difference.

Here's what I've learned about K-cups:
- Store them in a cool, dry place
- Check expiration dates
- Don't puncture them until you're ready to brew
- Try different brands to find your favorite

Pro tip: Use the strong brew setting if your machine has one. It slows down the water flow, allowing better extraction. I also found that running an empty brew cycle before making coffee helps heat up the system properly.

For those who find their coffee still tastes weak, try this hack: After brewing about half your cup, lift the handle (this stops the brewing process), wait 5 seconds, then close it and continue brewing. This creates a stronger cup.

If you're thinking about getting a Keurig, I highly recommend checking out the current models here: https://explorehonedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers. They've really improved their technology over the years.

Some other tips I've discovered:
- Preheat your coffee mug with hot water
- Use the smallest cup size setting for stronger coffee
- Clean the needle regularly to prevent clogs
- Consider using a reusable K-cup filter for fresh ground coffee

For iced coffee lovers, brew at the strongest setting over ice. The ice will melt slightly, creating the perfect balance of strength and temperature.

These methods have transformed my daily coffee from merely acceptable to genuinely enjoyable. Remember, good coffee isn't just about the machine - it's about how you use it.

I've also found that different K-cup brands produce notably different results. Some premium brands definitely make better coffee than others. It's worth experimenting to find your perfect match.

Regular maintenance is crucial. I keep a schedule for cleaning and descaling, which has helped maintain consistent quality in every cup I brew.

Using these techniques, you can definitely make a cup of coffee that rivals what you'd get at a coffee shop. It just takes a bit of practice and attention to detail.",1,1752825611.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

I got a krups precision XP801T10, I do think I have a good result but I feel I'm missing something, here are some details:

With no pressurized cup (2cups size), no matter the quantity or the grinding level (even 1), it's very watery, no pressure at all, the pressure meter doesn't even budge!

I tried double wall, and there .. finally was able to get the pressure in the correct pressure zone. I can't though add up more pressure if I want:

1. I am already on level 1 grinding. I use the maximum of the portafilter (which is 18g).
2. What I get from it, yield can goes up to 60g+ but I stop it way earlier to get around 36-44g yield.
3. With 5 seconds pre-infusion, I stop at 26 seconds for around 44g yield.

From my readings, videos I watched, that's not optimal!! I have good pressure according to the machine, but I don't get the yield between 25-30 seconds as it's recommended!

I can't add up more coffee and I can't get more pressure by grinding less...

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Ninja SLUSHi FS301 definitely has the vibe of a premium appliance. With its sleek black exterior, subtle accents, and intuitive dial, the machine looks refined and modern without being overly complicated. It's a bit bulky at 19.8 x 19.4 x 9.8 inches, but considering it houses an 88 oz. vessel—enough to serve a crowd—I think the size is justified. The clear vessel makes it easy to see your drink’s progress, while the sturdy pour handle means no mess when serving. While it weighs 27 pounds, I found it fairly easy to move around my kitchen. It feels durable, which is reassuring given how often I plan to put it to use.

**Ease of Use**  
This shaved ice machine really leans into simplicity, which I appreciated. The 5 preset programs let you make everything from margaritas to frappés to slushies with just a press of a button. Even someone like me, who’s prone to overcomplicating things in the kitchen, found the Ninja’s one-touch controls refreshingly straightforward. Temperature and texture controls allow you to customize each beverage, catering to guests who might prefer a thicker slush or a thinner, more drinkable consistency. The easy-fill vessel is a nice touch as well because I didn’t have to wrestle with awkward openings when pouring in liquids. Cleanup made me happier still—most of the parts are dishwasher-safe, and the detachable lid and drip tray make wiping away residual mess fairly effortless.

**Performance and RapidChill Technology**  
The RapidChill Technology is this product's crown jewel, and I have to say it works like a charm. Using a two-part system that spins an auger around a cooling cylinder, it freezes liquids evenly while maintaining the perfect temperature. My first test involved turning chocolate milk into a frozen treat—it only required 20 minutes to transform into perfectly textured slush. I’ve made iced coffees, fruit punches, and even used soda to create fizzy slushes. Each time, the consistency was the same: smooth, icy, and flavorful without a hint of graininess or watered-down blobs, which I’ve encountered with other machines. Important to note—sugar is a must for perfect slushing. I experimented with sugar substitutes for sugar-free recipes as per the guidelines, and results varied depending on the brand of the substitute.

**Advantages**  
The positives of the Ninja SLUSHi FS301 outshine most of the challenges I encountered. A few aspects worth highlighting include:  

- **Versatile Functionality**: Works for beverages like wine, coffee, soda, or juice, turning almost any liquid into slush.  
- **Quiet Operation**: The WhisperChill Compressor lives up to its name—no obnoxious clunking sounds as the machine works.  
- **Extended Freezing**: Drinks stay frozen for up to 12 hours, making it ideal for parties where guests are constantly grabbing refills.   
- **No Ice Required**: Eliminating the need for blending or ice is practical and ensures no diluted flavors.  

**Downsides**  
That said, there are a couple of hiccups worth noting:  

- **Learning Curve for Sugar-Free Recipes**: While sugar-free substitutes are an option, figuring out the right formula for consistent results took some experimentation on my end.  
- **Bulkiness**: While the XL capacity is great for batches, the large build may not fit seamlessly on all kitchens' countertops.   
- **Time Variance for Recipes**: Depending on the liquid, drinks can take anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes, which might test your patience when you’re in a rush.  

**Other Options**  
It’s hard not to compare the Ninja SLUSHi FS301 to similar frozen drink makers like the Margaritaville Frozen Concoction Maker and the Nostalgia Electrics Ice Cream Maker, two brands that try to cater to this specific audience. The Margaritaville machine focuses more on blended drinks, which can be limiting if you're chasing slush-style consistency. On the other hand, the Nostalgia machine is quite manual, lacks preset settings, and isn’t as user-friendly as Ninja’s one-touch system. Additionally, the Ninja’s ability to freeze drinks sans ice sets it apart, as most alternatives rely on pre-chilled liquids or heavy blending.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering you’re not just getting a shaved ice machine but an all-around frozen drink wizard, the cost-performance ratio feels solid. It's an investment, no doubt, but with its versatility, party-friendly design, and focus on quality, it feels like money well spent. Whether for frequent entertainers or anyone who just loves indulging in icy treats, it justifies itself over time. Even small perks like reduced cleanup time and quiet operation enhance its overall value.

1m2w3iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m2w3iv/how_can_you_style_your_coffee_table_like_an/,How can you style your coffee table like an interior designer?,"I recently transformed my living room by restyling my coffee table, and I've learned some game-changing tips that I want to share. After months of research and experimenting, I've figured out how to make this central piece look professionally designed without breaking the bank.

First, let's talk about choosing the right coffee table. Your table needs to match your room's style and size. I spent weeks looking for the perfect one and found an amazing selection here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. The key is finding something that's both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Here's my foolproof styling formula:

1. Work in layers
Start with a large tray or books as your base. This creates a foundation and makes everything look intentional rather than scattered. I use a wooden tray that adds warmth to my glass coffee table.

2. Follow the rule of three
Group items in threes - it's visually appealing and creates balance. I combine a tall vase, a medium-sized candle, and a small decorative object.

3. Mix heights and textures
Varying heights create visual interest. I pair tall flowers with short books and add different textures like ceramic, metal, and natural materials.

4. Add something living
Plants or fresh flowers instantly elevate the space. I keep a small succulent that's low maintenance but adds life to the arrangement.

5. Include practical items
Your coffee table should be functional. I keep a stylish remote control holder and coasters that complement my decor.

The best part? You don't need expensive accessories. I found most of my decor items affordably, and if you're still looking for the perfect coffee table, check out these stunning options: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

6. Seasonal updates
I switch out small decorative items seasonally. In fall, I add mini pumpkins; during winter, pinecones and metallic accents work great.

7. Consider the negative space
Don't overcrowd your table. Leave some empty space - it makes the arrangement look intentional and keeps the table functional.

Remember to step back and look at your arrangement from different angles. Sometimes moving items an inch or two makes a huge difference. I rearrange mine every few weeks to keep things fresh and interesting.

These techniques have completely transformed my living room's appearance, making it look professionally designed. The key is starting with the right coffee table and building from there.

Every day, you can have coffee on the patio in the morning, visit guests in the afternoon, and have dinner under ambient lights at night. The louvered roof system can be used in various ways, so you don't have to worry about the weather.***

A smart pergola is a modern outdoor structure with a roof that can be adjusted. A smart pergola changes in real time, [**Florida Cabanas**](https://luxepergola.com/), unlike typical pergolas with fixed slats or beams that don't protect against the weather very well. Louvres may be opened, closed, or turned at the press of a button. It allows you to manage sunshine, shade, airflow, and even rain.

**Smart Roofs Provide Architectural Benefits**

Your pergola becomes a part of your home's design with a smart roof. The Best Motorized Pergola allows you to choose from a wide range of options, including colors, textures, post designs, and lighting, ensuring it complements your current design style.

**The Technology Behind the Beauty**

The use of current technologies is what makes a smart pergola smart. The system features louvres crafted with meticulous care and operated by quiet, dependable motors. Innovative pergolas are also suitable for businesses, such as high-end restaurants and luxury resorts.

They provide companies with more space to serve customers in style, regardless of the weather, and they have a high-end look. And because the systems can be modified to align with brand standards and architectural vision, they integrate well.

**Combining Smart Technology**

Pergolas are no longer merely decorative structures; they are becoming practical ways to utilize the outdoors. You can now use a simple app on your phone to manage automated louvered roofs, lights, fans, and even heating systems.

There is an increasing number of motorized and sensor-driven designs. These designs enable your pergola to change automatically, providing shade, letting in sunlight, or keeping you dry from the rain.

 **Personalization Is Key**

Customization is the most critical part of contemporary pergola design. You may choose everything about the building, from its size and color to the outside accessories that come with it, such as lighting, fans, and retractable screens. It knows that every homeowner has a different vision; therefore, they provide personalized solutions that make outdoor aspirations come true.

**Mixing Up the Inside and Outside**

Luxe Pergola is distinct from other firms in that it exclusively deals with businesses, rather than individual clients. This means that every component of their plan is intended to help contractors and partners succeed. When distributors work with a manufacturer and its support team, they don't have to worry about delays or inadequate communication. 

**Solutions That Save Energy**

Comfort and sustainability go hand in hand. More and more people are buying pergolas that save energy, particularly those that allow homeowners to control the sun and airflow organically. A Louvered Roof Pergola lets you manage light and shadow exactly, which may help lower the cost of cooling your home in the summer.",1,1752824241.0,u_luxepergola,0,1.0,False

I’m the one with Bipolar. There is a lot of issues that have been arising. I gave him 2 weeks to find an income as I told him I cannot financially support both of us anymore. I do freelance bartending and event work. (Left my previous job because it took such a strain on my physical health) he left his bartending job as well. This was before we moved in. He was just a friend and staying over as just a friend. We always had sexual tension and in a bad decision I kissed him first. Don’t get me wrong he’s amazing I’m just really tired of financially supporting him. I smoke weed for my anxiety and chronic pain (endometriosis and severe knee injury) I grew a beautiful plant that I harvested. I’m very open with my weed and often give away to friends. My issue came in when i would go to grab some and there would be none left. So I separated less than 2g dedicated to my study weed. Now that is all that’s left. I’m really tired of setting what I perceive as common boundaries to people. (For reference I smoke for the medicinal benefits ie a joint can last me well over a week. He smokes to get high, he does also have chronic pain and is going for surgery next month to fix his collar bone -an issue that has been needed to me fixed for the last about 7 or so months. He is only now getting it sorted after I started bring up he needs to contribute or leave) So he finishes joints very quickly. I even rolled separate joints and then when he finished his he went to mine) I feel trapped. I see him more as a roommates with benefits (we have an open relationship) he has done a good amount to help me (reprogrammed my laptop, got me a few games on special on steam, makes me coffee occasionally) I just don’t feel like it’s an equal situation at the moment. He doesn’t pay for any groceries, water or electricity. I’ve tried to get him into events but he isn’t as passionate about bartending as I am) I’m feel like an asshole for having to set boundaries and I am trying to be nice about it but I’m struggling. I do a lot of the household chores, I cook and I regularly do dishes, I do the washing, he won’t even change the bedsheets without me asking.

Mr. Fleming, please, take it easy..."" On her birthday, Celeste Rodriguez witnessed her husband, Trevor Fleming, kissing another woman deeply, his hand relentlessly moving under the woman's skirt.  
Standing outside the office, overhearing this scene, Celeste's eyes filled with tears, her face pale with shock. She had loved this man for seven years, loving him so much that she gave up her career, abandoned her dreams, and wasted the best years of her life. This time, she decided to let go...  
  
After seven years of marriage, my husband, Trevor, fell for another woman—even our daughter wanted her as her new mom.  
I scoffed at the years I’d wasted and handed him the divorce papers. Yet he dropped his usual aloofness, slamming me against the wall,  
“Divorce? Not a chance.”  
\*\*\*  
When Celeste Rodriguez landed at the airport in Andostan, it was already past 9:00 pm.  
It was her birthday. Her phone buzzed with messages from colleagues and friends—but not a single one from her husband, Trevor Fleming.  
Celeste's smile faded.  
By the time she reached the villa, it was already past 10:00 pm.  
Hannah Lynd, the housekeeper looked startled. ""Mrs. Fleming... what a surprise.""  
""Where are Trevor and Jo?"" Celeste asked, handing over her luggage.  
""Mr. Fleming isn’t back yet. Miss Jordyn’s upstairs playing.""  
Celeste climbed the stairs. In her room, Jordyn sat in pajamas at her desk, completely absorbed.  
""Jo?"" Celeste called.  
Jordyn turned, her eyes lighting up. In a happy tone, she greeted, ""Mom!""  
But then she quickly got back to what she was doing earlier.  
Celeste walked over and hugged her tight, planting a kiss on her cheek. Yet the little one pushed her away and squirmed. ""Mom, I’m busy.""   
It had been two months since Celeste last saw Jordyn. She missed her so much that no amount of kisses felt enough. She wanted to talk to Jordyn.  
She noticed the necklace Jordyn was threading. ""Jo, are you making a seashell necklace?""  
""Mm-hm!"" Jordyn perked up visibly. ""Wynn's birthday is in a week. Dad and I picked and polished these ourselves. Pretty, right?""  
Celeste’s throat tightened. Jordyn didn’t look up, only added brightly, ""Dad even got her a custom gift, tomorrow—""  
Celeste felt a pang in her chest and couldn't hold back anymore. ""Jo… Do you remember it's my birthday today?""  
""Huh?"" Jordyn glanced up briefly, then quickly looked back down at the string of beads in her hands, She complained, ""Mom, don’t talk, Look, I messed up the bead order—""  
Celeste stood there in silence for a while, but Jordyn never looked back up. Finally, Celeste pursed her lips and left the room without another word.  
Downstairs, Hannah said, ""I called Mr. Fleming. He said he’s busy tonight and you should rest first.""  
""I see."" Celeste replied softly.  
She hesitated, then called Trevor. It rang for a while before he answered.  
his tone was indifferent as usual. ""I'm busy. Let's talk tomorrow—""  
A woman’s voice chimed in: ""Trevor, who is it?""  
Wynn.  
Celeste gripped the phone tighter.  
""No one important,"" Trevor answered her.  
Before Celeste could say anything, Trevor had already hung up.  
Celeste stared at the screen. Two or three months apart, and this was all he had for her.  
After so many years of marriage, he’d always been cold. Distant. Impatient.   
She had got used to chasing after him, calling again, begging for time. Yet tonight, she didn’t bother.   
Perhaps she was just too tired.  
  
The next morning, Celeste thought it over and decided to call Trevor again.  
There was a time difference of about 17 or 18 hours between Andostan and their home country. In Andostan, today was her actual birthday.  
She didn’t just come here for Jordyn. She wanted one thing: a family meal. Her only birthday wish.  
Yet, Trevor didn’t answer.  
A long time later, he texted: What’s up?  
She replied: Lunch today? Just the three of us.  
Trevor answered: Okay. Send the address.  
Alright, she typed back.  
That was it. No acknowledgment. No “Happy birthday.” She wasn’t surprised. But it still stung.  
As she headed downstairs, she overheard Jordyn talking with Hannah.  
""Aren't you happy that Mrs. Fleming is here, sweetie?"" Hannah asked.  
""Dad and I promised to take Wynn to the beach tomorrow. If Mom comes, it'll be weird. She’s always mean to Wynn.""  
""Mrs. Fleming is still your mom, sweetie. That’s hurtful.""  
""I know, but Dad and I like Wynn more. Can't Wynn be my mom instead?""  
Celeste froze.  
She had raised Jordyn herself most of the time. But over the past two years, the more time Jordyn spent with Trevor, the more attached she became to him. When Trevor came to Andostan to expand his business last year, Jordyn had insisted on coming along.  
Celeste was reluctant and had hoped Jordyn would stay by her side. But she couldn't bear to see Jordyn upset, so she agreed.  
And now, Jordyn didn’t even want her as her mom anymore.  
Celeste stood frozen in place, her face pale. To think that she had pushed aside her work to come to Andostan with the intention of spending more time with Jordyn.  
Now, it seemed unnecessary.  
She walked back to her room, pale and quiet, then repacked the gifts she’d brought.  
Later, Hannah texted: Madame, I took Jordyn out. Let me know if you need anything.  
Celeste sat on the bed, feeling hollow and lost inside. She had abandoned her work and made this trip, only to find no one wanted her here.  
Her arrival was nothing but a joke.  
  
After a long while, she left the villa. Aimlessly, she drove around in this foreign yet familiar country.  
By noon, she remembered she had planned to have lunch with Trevor and Jordyn. As she recalled what she had overheard in the morning, she hesitated about whether to go home and pick up Jordyn.   
Then, a text from Trevor came: Something came up. Lunch’s canceled.  
Celeste stared at it.  
She should’ve known. Trevor always canceled on her.  His work, friends, and everything else always came before her, his wife.  
Once, she’d cry. Today, she just felt… empty.  
Celeste was at an utter loss. She had come all this way excitedly only to be met with indifference from both Trevor and Jordyn.  
Aimlessly, she drove around. Eventually, she found herself outside an old favorite restaurant which she and Trevor used to frequent.  
Just as she was about to walk in, she saw them.  
Trevor. Jordyn. Wynn.  
Wynn sat next to Jordyn, laughing, feeding the little one the pastries she had taken a bite out of. Jordyn giggled, with her legs swinging around happily. Trevor smiled as he served food to both of them, but his gaze never left Wynn.  
What a happy family of three!  
So this was his ""something came up.""  
And this was the daughter she had carried for ten long months and nearly lost her life to bring into this world.  
Celeste laughed humorlessly. She stood there watching for a long time. Finally, she turned and drove away.  
  
Back at the villa, Celeste drafted the divorce agreement.  
Trevor had been her teenage dream—but he had never truly seen her. If not for that one night and his grandfather Arnold Fleming’s pressure, he never would’ve married her. She thought loving him hard enough would be enough, but seven years proved otherwise.  
For a long time, she felt lucky to have Jo—her only source of comfort. But now, even Jo didn’t seem to want her.  
That was it.  
She was done—with the marriage, the lies, the thankless role of wife and mother. It was time to leave all this behind—and reclaim the promising life she'd given up!  
She sealed the divorce papers, handed them to Hannah, then grabbed her suitcase and walked out, bound for the airport. On the way, she finally dialed the number she’d been avoiding for months.  
The line rang once. Twice. A click.  
“Hello?”  
She took a breath, steady and sharp.“That offer still stand?”“I’m in.”  
...  
At around 9:00 pm, Trevor and Jordyn returned home.  
Jordyn clung to the hem of Trevor's coat and got out of the car sluggishly. Because Celeste was at home, she was reluctant to return that night.  
But Wynn had said that Celeste came specifically to be with her and Trevor, and if they didn't return, she would be sad. Trevor also said that if they didn't go home that night, Celeste would definitely insist on joining them on their outing to the sea the next day.  
Reluctantly, Jordyn agreed to come home.  
Still worried, she muttered gloomily, ""Dad, what if Mom insists on tagging along with us tomorrow?""  
""She won't,"" Trevor replied confidently.  
In all the years they'd been married, Celeste had always tried to find ways to spend more time with him. But she was also sensible. As long as he made his stance clear, she wouldn't dare make him upset.  
In Jordyn's memory, Celeste always listened to Trevor. Since he said she wouldn't, she felt reassured. As a result, her mood lifted. She made her way into the villa cheerfully and told Hannah she wanted to take a bath.  
""Sure, sure,"" Hannah replied to Jordyn. Then, she remembered Celeste's instructions and handed an envelope to Trevor. ""Mr. Fleming, this is from Mrs. Fleming. She asked me to give it to you.""  
Trevor took the envelope and asked casually, ""Where is she?""  
""Mrs. Fleming packed up and went back to the country this afternoon. Didn't you know?"" Hannah responded.  
Trevor paused mid-step as he was heading upstairs. He turned back, feeling a little surprised. ""Has she gone back?""  
""Yes.""  
Why had Celeste suddenly come to Andostan? Trevor hadn't given her a chance to tell him about it. He hadn't cared to ask either. Upon learning she'd left, he didn't dwell on it.  
Jordyn was a little surprised too. When she heard the news, she felt a small twinge of disappointment. She'd been thinking that even if Celeste didn't join them for the outing tomorrow, it might be nice to have her around at home in the evening.  
Polishing the seashells made her hands hurt—she had been counting on Celeste's help in finishing the necklace.  
Though it had been months since Trevor and Celeste had seen each other, she had made the effort to visit but only to leave without seeing him in person. Hannah recalled Celeste's grim expression as she left and thought that things felt a little off.  
She couldn't help but say, ""Mr. Fleming, Mrs. Fleming looked upset when she left. She seemed angry.""  
Hannah had assumed Celeste's sudden departure was due to an urgent matter. Upon realizing Trevor hadn't known she'd left, she began to feel something was amiss.  
""Angry?"" Trevor repeated in his mind.   
In his presence, Celeste had always been patient and accommodating. So, she could get angry too? This was new.  
Trevor smiled faintly and responded to Hannah perfunctorily before heading upstairs.  
Back in the bedroom, he was about to open the envelope Celeste had left when Wynn called. After answering the call, he tossed the envelope aside and walked out the door.  
A short while later, the envelope slipped off the bed onto the floor.  
That night, Trevor didn't return home.  
The next day, Hannah noticed the envelope on the floor when she was cleaning. Recognizing it as the one Celeste had asked her to hand over, she assumed Trevor had already seen it and placed it in a nearby drawer.  
…  
Right after getting off the plane, Celeste went home and began packing her belongings. She had accumulated quite a few things in the house since she'd been living there for six years, after all. But she only took a few sets of clothes, two sets of daily necessities, and some books that were related to her field of study back in college.  
After their marriage, Trevor had been depositing money for her and Jordyn into two separate accounts every month. One account was hers, and the other was Jordyn's.  
However, Celeste was used to spending her own money only. She had never touched the money in Jordyn's account. Because she loved Trevor, whenever she went shopping and saw clothes, shoes, cufflinks, or ties that suited him, she couldn't help but buy them.  
In contrast, she didn't have many expenses on a daily basis because all she did was go to work. Her heart and mind were always focused on Trevor and Jordyn. She wanted to give them the best of everything.  
Most of the money Trevor deposited into her bank account was spent on him and Jordyn.  
Given this spending pattern, there shouldn't have been much money left in Celeste's account. But over the past year, her opportunities to buy things for Trevor and Jordyn had decreased significantly because they were in Andostan.  
Now, there were over three million dollars in her account. That amount might not matter to Trevor, but to her, it was no small sum. And since it was her money, Celeste didn't hesitate to transfer it out.  
She left both cards behind, dragged her suitcase out the door, and didn't look back.  
Celeste had an apartment near her workplace, which was a little over 1,100 square feet. She'd bought it four years ago to support a friend who had been struggling to meet their sales targets. She had never lived there before.  
Now, the apartment came in handy. She had it cleaned regularly, so it wasn't dirty. After a quick tidy-up, it was ready to move in.  
After a long day, Celeste washed up and went to bed around 10:00 pm.  
…  
The shrill sound of an alarm jolted Celeste awake. Startled, her mind went blank for a moment.  
When she came to her senses, she realized that while it was 1:00 am here, it was 7:00 am in Andostan, where Trevor and Jordyn were. This was their usual breakfast time.  
Ever since Jordyn had gone to live with Trevor in Andostan, Celeste had developed the habit of calling her at this time every day. As she was always exhausted from work and was used to going to bed early, she had set this alarm to ensure she wouldn't miss the call.  
At first, Jordyn hadn't adapted well to living in Andostan and had missed her terribly. She had called Celeste constantly. But as time went on, the calls that used to be full of yearning and dependence had grown perfunctory and impatient.  
The alarm was no longer necessary. She just hadn't been able to let go.  
Smiling bitterly, Celeste deleted the alarm and turned off her phone before going back to sleep.  
…  
Meanwhile, Trevor and Jordyn were nearly done with breakfast. Though he knew Celeste usually called Jordyn at this time, he wasn't always home and hadn't paid much attention to the routine.  
He noticed that Celeste hadn't called that day. The fact registered in his mind, but he didn't care. After finishing breakfast, he went upstairs to change.  
Jordyn, finding Celeste increasingly annoying, had grown less fond of their calls. Upon realizing that Celeste hadn't called yet, she figured something must have come up.  
She grabbed her backpack and bolted for the door.  
Hannah hurried after her. ""Ms. Fleming, it's still early. There's no rush!""  
Jordyn ignored her and ran to the car happily. She was thrilled that Celeste hadn't called on time that day. If she stayed home, she might still have to talk to Celeste later. Well, she didn't want that!  
…  
After getting married to Trevor, Celeste had joined Fleming Group for his sake. Now that she was planning to divorce him, she saw no reason to stay.  
The next morning, Celeste handed her resignation letter to Zeke Jackson after arriving at the office.  
Zeke was one of Trevor's personal secretaries. When he saw Celeste's resignation letter, he was extremely surprised.  
He was one of the few in the company who knew about the relationship between Celeste and Trevor.  
Anyone familiar with Trevor knew that he didn't love Celeste. So, he had been cold to her and rarely went home after their marriage.  
To get closer to and win over Trevor, Celeste had chosen to work at Fleming Group.  
Her initial goal was to become his personal secretary, but Trevor refused vehemently. Even when Arnold stepped in, he couldn't get Trevor to agree. In the end, Celeste had to settle for a position in the secretarial team, becoming one of Trevor's many ordinary secretaries.  
At first, Zeke had worried that Celeste's presence in the secretarial team would create chaos. But to his surprise, she didn't bring them any trouble. Although Celeste used her position to get closer to Trevor, she was mindful of her timing and never overstepped her boundaries.   
On the contrary, she worked diligently and performed exceptionally well, hoping to gain Trevor's respect. Whether during her pregnancy, childbirth, or any other time, she strictly adhered to company policies and never sought special treatment.  
Over the years, Celeste rose to become the head of the secretarial team. Zeke had observed her feelings for Trevor from the sidelines all the while. To be honest, he had never imagined she would resign one day. He felt skeptical about her willingly giving up her position.  
Something must have happened between Celeste and Trevor for her to resign now. Zeke understood that this was something he wasn't privy to—it must be something significant enough for Trevor to have ordered her to resign.  
While he found it a pity, Zeke maintained a professional tone. ""I acknowledge that I've received your resignation letter. I'll arrange for someone to take over your duties as soon as possible.""  
""Alright."" Celeste nodded and returned to her workstation.  
After working for a while, Zeke started an online meeting with Trevor to report on company matters. As the conversation neared its end, he suddenly remembered Celeste's resignation.   
""Oh, Mr. Fleming, there's one more thing—""  
Although Zeke had told Celeste he would quickly arrange for someone to take over her position, he wanted to gauge Trevor's thoughts on the matter first. If Trevor wanted Celeste out immediately, he would make the arrangements right away.  
But as the words left his mouth, he remembered that when Celeste first joined the company, Trevor had explicitly stated that all matters regarding her employment should be handled per company regulations. He made it clear that there was no need to report anything to him since he wouldn't concern himself with her.  
And indeed, over the years, Trevor had never actively inquired about Celeste's work at the company.  
Even when he encountered her at work, he treated her like she was a complete stranger.  
When Celeste was set to be promoted a couple of years ago, the team had hesitated. Everyone was aware of Trevor's dislike for her. They had even brought it up with him to gauge his opinion back then.  
Trevor had frowned in annoyance and reiterated that he wouldn't interfere and that they should handle it according to company policy. He had emphasized that they shouldn't bring up Celeste's matters with him again.  
Seeing Zeke's hesitation, Trevor frowned. ""What is it?""  
Zeke snapped out of his thoughts and quickly replied, ""Oh, it's nothing.""  
Since Trevor was already aware of Celeste's resignation but hadn't brought it up, it was clear that this matter wasn't important to him. So, Zeke decided to proceed as usual and handle the matter according to company regulations.  
With that resolved, Trevor ended the call.  
…  
""What are you thinking about?"" At noon, a colleague patted Celeste on the shoulder.  
Celeste came back to her senses and smiled, shaking her head. ""Nothing.""  
""Don't you need to call your daughter today?""  
""No, not today.""  
Typically, she called Jordyn twice a day—once at 1:00 am and once at around 12:00 pm.  
Her colleagues at work were aware of this habit. What they didn't know was her daughter was the child she had with the company's CEO.  
After work, Celeste went to the supermarket. She bought some groceries and a few potted plants before heading home.  
After dinner, she browsed online for information about the upcoming technology exhibition.   
After that, she made a call. ""Please reserve a ticket for next month's tech exhibition for me.""  
""Are you sure?"" the person on the other end replied coolly. ""The last two times you asked me to reserve tickets, you didn't show up. Do you know how many people's lifelong dream is to get one of those tickets? You wasted them thoughtlessly.""  
The annual tech exhibition was a major event in the industry, and tickets were not easily obtainable.  
Their company had a limited number of slots, and many IT elites working for them eagerly vied for the opportunity to attend it.  
""If I don't show up to the exhibition this time, I will never ask you to reserve a ticket for me ever again,"" Celeste promised.  
There was silence on the other end before the line disconnected.   
Celeste knew that he'd agreed. The corners of her mouth tugged upward into a smile. What she hadn't said was that she wanted to return to the company.  
Though she was one of the partners of her tech firm, she had stepped back during its early days to focus on marriage and family. Her decision had disrupted their development plans and cost them many opportunities.  
Her colleagues had been both angry and frustrated with her. Over the years, they had rarely been in contact.  
While Celeste was eager to return, she knew she had been out of the industry for too long. If she went back unprepared, she was worried she wouldn't be able to keep up with the company's current pace.  
So, she planned to spend some time familiarizing herself with the industry's latest developments before making a concrete decision.  
For the next few days, Celeste focused on her work during office hours and spent her evenings tending to her own matters. She didn't reach out to Jordyn or Trevor, and they didn't contact her either.  
Celeste wasn't surprised. For over half a year, her communication with them had been one-sided. They had only passively responded to her efforts.  
…  
Meanwhile, in Andostan, Jordyn had developed the habit of calling Wynn first thing every morning.  
That day, she called Wynn right after waking up as usual. However, the call didn't last long before she burst into tears.  
Wynn had told her some bad news. ""I'm going back to the country soon.""  
Devastated, Jordyn finished the call and immediately phoned Trevor. ""Dad, did you know about this?""  
At his office, Trevor flipped through some documents. ""Yes.""  
""When did you find out?""  
""It's been a while.""  
""Dad, you're so mean…"" Jordyn hugged her pink stuffed pig and cried loudly. ""I don't want Wynn to leave. If she's not here, I don't want to go to school here anymore. I want to go back too!""  
Trevor's tone remained even. ""It's already being arranged.""  
Jordyn didn't understand. ""W-What do you mean?""  
""We're going back next week.""  
Jordyn jumped out of bed in excitement. ""Really?""  
""Yes, really,"" Trevor replied.  
""Then why didn't Wynn tell me just now?""  
""It was just finalized. She doesn't know yet.""  
Jordyn was ecstatic. ""Dad, let's keep this a secret from Wynn. We'll surprise her when we go back to the country, okay?""  
""Alright.""  
""You're the best, Dad! I love you so much!""  
After hanging up, Jordyn was still overjoyed. She sang and danced on her bed.  
After a while, she suddenly thought of Celeste. For the past few days, she had been in a great mood because Celeste hadn't called her. In fact, to avoid talking to Celeste, she had deliberately left home early and even turned off her phone or kept it far away from her after school.  
But after two days, she was worried that Celeste might get angry if she found out. So, she stopped doing that. To her surprise, Celeste hadn't called at all in the days that followed.  
At first, she thought Celeste had discovered that she was deliberately avoiding her calls. But then she remembered that based on past experiences, that wasn't very likely. If Celeste knew she had done something wrong, she would immediately ask Jordyn to correct her wrongdoing instead of sulking and not calling.  
After all, she was the most important person to Celeste. Jordyn knew that Celeste loved her the most, so she didn't think that Celeste would purposely refrain from calling her simply because she was upset.  
As Jordyn thought about this, she suddenly missed Celeste. It was the first time in days she had thought about Celeste, and she couldn't resist dialing Celeste's number.  
But just as the call connected, she remembered that while she would get to see Wynn after returning to the country, Celeste would undoubtedly try every possible way to prevent her from meeting Wynn. She wouldn't be able to see Wynn whenever she wanted like she could now.  
This thought dampened Jordyn's mood.  
It was midnight in Celeste's time zone. She was already asleep when she was woken by the call. Upon seeing Jordyn's name on the screen, she was about to answer when the call abruptly disconnected.  
Although Celeste had written in her divorce agreement that she would relinquish custody of Jordyn, she still felt a sense of responsibility as her mother. Worried that something might have happened, Celeste immediately called back.  
When Jordyn saw the incoming call, she turned her head away and refused to answer.  
Celeste became more concerned and quickly called the landline at the villa.  
Hannah answered promptly. After hearing Celeste's concerns, she reassured her, ""Ms. Fleming should be fine. She went to bed late last night and woke up late today. When I checked earlier, she was still asleep. I'll go upstairs to take a look and call you back.""  
Feeling relieved, Celeste replied, ""Thank you.""  
When Hannah went upstairs, Jordyn was already in the bathroom brushing her teeth.  
After Hannah relayed Celeste being worried about her, Jordyn lowered her head and lied, ""I accidentally hit the call button.""  
Hannah believed her and didn't doubt what she said. Seeing that Jordyn was still brushing her teeth, she went back downstairs to update Celeste that Jordyn was fine.  
Jordyn watched as Hannah left. She huffed and finally felt a bit better.  
After hearing Hannah's reassurance, Celeste felt relieved too. Still, having been abruptly woken, she struggled to fall back asleep. She wasn't in great shape the next morning at work.  
The envelope containing the divorce agreement was completely forgotten by Trevor after the phone call with Wynn.  
On the day they returned to the country, Trevor packed the last document into his briefcase and ensured that nothing was left behind before heading downstairs.  
""All set. Let's go.""  
The Lincoln stretch limousine departed from the villa and headed to the airport.  
…  
That night, at around 10:00 pm, the plane carrying Trevor and Jordyn landed on time. By the time they got home, it was nearly midnight.   
Jordyn had fallen asleep before they arrived. When Trevor carried her upstairs, he passed the master bedroom and noticed the door was open, but the room was pitch black.  
After putting Jordyn on her bed and tucking her in, he returned to the master bedroom and turned on the light. Then, he glanced at the bed and found that it was empty—Celeste wasn't there.  
Just then, the butler, Peter Hawk, came upstairs with his luggage.   
Loosening his tie, Trevor asked, ""Where is she?""  
Peter replied, ""Mrs. Fleming is on a business trip.""  
Half a month ago, Peter hadn't been around when Celeste had left with her suitcase. The other maids told him that Celeste left with a suitcase, so he had assumed she was traveling for work.  
Now that he thought about it, this was unusual. Celeste rarely went on business trips. Even when she did, they typically lasted only two or three days.  
This time, she had been gone for over two weeks.  
""Alright,"" Trevor responded indifferently, asking no further questions.  
...  
The next day, Celeste unexpectedly ran into Trevor at the company. She hadn't known that Trevor and Jordyn had returned to the country. Caught off guard by their sudden encounter, Celeste froze mid-step.  
Trevor also seemed slightly surprised to see her, but he assumed she had just returned from the business trip and didn't think much of it.  
He passed by her coldly, his face expressionless. As usual, he treated her like she was a stranger and turned to enter the building.  
In the past, if Celeste had found out that he'd suddenly come back, she would have been overjoyed. Even if she couldn't throw herself into his arms in such a scenario, she would have been very happy and excited. Her eyes would light up as she greeted him.   
Even if Trevor remained indifferent, she would have smiled and wished him good morning enthusiastically.  
But now, Celeste merely glanced at his handsome face before lowering her eyes. There was no longer any trace of the joy and excitement she once felt.  
Trevor didn't notice any of this and was already walking away.  
Watching his tall and composed figure disappear into the building, Celeste wondered when he had returned. Since he was back, perhaps the matter of their divorce could soon be addressed.  
Having resolved to go through with the divorce, Celeste didn't dwell on him further. After she returned to her workstation, she quickly immersed herself in her work.  
Half an hour later, Zeke called her and instructed her to do something. ""Prepare two cups of coffee and take them to Mr. Fleming's office.""  
In the early days of her marriage, Celeste had learned that Trevor enjoyed coffee. In hopes of winning his favor, she had spent a great deal of effort studying how to brew it perfectly. Her efforts had paid off. After tasting her coffee, Trevor began to specifically request it, both at home and at the office.  
When she first realized he genuinely liked the coffee she made, Celeste had been thrilled. She naively believed it was the first step toward gaining his approval.  
But she had underestimated his dislike and wariness of her. While he liked her coffee, that was all he liked. His attitude toward her remained cold and distant.  
Even when he wanted her coffee, he would have Zeke reach out to her. Once the coffee was prepared, someone else would pick it up for him. He never gave her the opportunity to approach him herself.  
Only on rare occasions when no one else was available did she get the chance to deliver it to his office personally.  
This time, it seemed she was to take the coffee directly to Trevor herself from Zeke's tone. After brewing the coffee, Celeste placed the cups on a tray and carried them to his office.  
The door to his office was ajar.  
As she approached and was about to knock on the door politely, she saw Wynn sitting on Trevor's lap. The two of them seemed to be locked in a passionate kiss.  
Celeste stopped in her tracks, her face turning pale.  
Upon seeing her, Wynn shot up from Trevor's lap, looking flustered.  
Trevor's expression darkened, and he questioned in an icy tone, ""Who allowed you to come in?""

1m2vtdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1m2vtdb/i_supported_my_wife_through_everythingnow_i_feel/,"I supported my wife through everything—now I feel discarded, like my role is over, and I’m just being managed.","First, I should say this is a disposal account since I wanted to be a little bit discrete.  
  
My wife and I are both 36. We’ve been married for 7 years. The first few years were solid—connected, warm, mutually supportive. But over the last 3.5 years, things have slowly fallen apart. Not in any dramatic way, but in a quiet, soul-eroding kind of way. I’ve done my best to stay steady through it all, but I’m starting to feel like I’m disappearing inside this relationship.

During those 3.5 years, everything changed. She gave birth to our child, we moved to a new country, and she lost her father. All major life events, all extremely difficult. And I never once downplayed how hard it was for her. I stood by her—emotionally, physically, financially.

During that time, she also had serious conflict with her mother and siblings. She was deeply hurt by it. My family and I were the ones who supported her. I was careful never to say anything negative about her family, even when her mother made our lives incredibly difficult and left us to carry everything. Ironically, she once got upset with me for not being more outspoken against them—but I thought I was doing the right thing by staying respectful and neutral.

Now that things are slowly getting better—she’s rebuilding her relationship with her mother, and maybe soon with her siblings—I find myself pushed to the sidelines. I’m not against her reconnecting with them. In fact, I want her to have a loving family around her. But it hurts that she can offer them warmth and grace, and treat me like a burden. It feels like I was the support system during the collapse—and now that the storm is clearing, I’ve been quietly set aside.

Outwardly, she’s still kind in a surface-level way. She’ll make coffee, ask what I want for dinner. But the real closeness—the intimacy, the affection, the warmth—is gone. She sleeps with our child, I sleep alone. Our sex life is nearly nonexistent. Every attempt I make to connect physically or emotionally is met with coldness or dismissal. A hug, a simple “good night,” often turns into a sarcastic “Now? Really?”  
It’s degrading. And it breaks my heart.

She’s cheerful and engaged with her friends—even new ones. She laughs, opens up, and brings her full self to those interactions. But with me? I get what’s left over. The silence. The irritation. The exhaustion. I feel like I’m the emotional trash bin where the leftovers of her day go.

She also criticizes me constantly—small, micro-level comments about how I talk, how I move, how I clean. It’s not yelling—it’s erosion. After a while, I start to withdraw. I shut down. I go quiet.  
And then, inevitably, I get blamed for that too:  
“Why don’t you talk?”  
“Why are you so cold?”  
If I try to explain how I feel, she gets defensive. She flips the script. Suddenly I’m the problem again.

There have been moments where she’s told me to shut up. She’s brought up my past or my family in arguments. I always try to stay calm, to not escalate—but inside, those words leave scars.

Financially, it’s been rough. She doesn’t work, so I picked up two jobs. I’ve worked full days, come home, cleaned, cooked, handled bedtime. I did it out of love—not to keep score—but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t hurt to feel so unrecognized.

She once went on a solo trip to visit her mother during a particularly tough financial stretch. I stayed behind, worked two jobs, and took care of our child alone. I didn’t say anything. I wanted her to rest. But later I heard her tell her friends, “I worked so hard learning the language, I deserved that break.”  
No mention of me. Not a word.

Sometimes I feel like I’ve been reduced to a child in her eyes—something to manage, to instruct, to put up with. Not a man. Not a partner.

I don’t think she’s cheating. There are no signs of that. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t afraid—**not just of infidelity**, but of how easily I’ve become invisible to the person I gave everything to.  
What if she’s simply done with me and just doesn’t say it?  
What if I was only ever the support she needed in a dark chapter—and now that it’s over, so is my relevance?

I still love her. I still want this to work. But I can’t keep pretending everything is fine while I feel like I’m fading into the walls of my own home. And also, I am really tired of being patient. It is becoming to feel like waiting a train that will never come.

And the truth is—beneath the work, the parenting, the calm exterior—I’m hurting.  
**I need emotional support. I need to feel held, understood, seen.**  
**There’s a part of me—my inner child—curled up in the corner of my soul, in the fetal position, scared and quiet, just waiting for someone to say, “You matter. I’m here.”**  
But that voice doesn’t come.  
And the silence is becoming unbearable.

Is it too much to want affection? Recognition? To be loved—not just helped along or tolerated?

**TL;DR:**  
We’re both 36, married for 7 years. Over the past 3.5 years—after childbirth, moving abroad, and her father’s death—I supported my wife in every way: emotionally, financially (working two jobs), and with childcare and housework. Despite that, I now feel emotionally and physically invisible. She’s warm with friends but cold with me. Constant micro-criticisms push me to withdraw, but when I go quiet, I’m blamed. I’m not afraid of infidelity, but I do feel abandoned. I still love her, but inside, I’m exhausted and hurting—just longing to feel seen, valued, and loved again.",1,1752823228.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False

# 1.Chapter 1 Call Off The Wedding

Melissa Bush stood in the middle of the crowded street, the noise around her barely registering over the chaos in her own head. Her phone buzzed, and when she saw her mom's name, she picked up like it was her last lifeline.

""Mom... Hugh wants to call off the wedding,"" she managed to say, her voice cracking before it gave way to quiet sobs.

""What?!"" Lillian Clayton's voice practically exploded through the phone. ""Melissa, are you serious? The wedding's tomorrow! What the hell happened?""

Every word Melissa forced out felt like tearing open a wound that refused to heal. ""The premarital medical report... it says I'm infertile.""

Her voice wavered, the last word almost choking her. ""But it might be a mistake! Mom, I swear, I never wanted his damn money. I even told him I'd sign a prenup! But he still—"" She cut off, unable to finish, the words catching in her throat.

Her thoughts spiraled, dragging her back to when she and Hugh had first fallen in love. Back in college, he'd been her everything—her rock. As soon as they graduated, he got down on one knee and promised her forever.

Sure, his family had looked down their noses at her modest background, but Hugh never let that shake him. He always made her feel like they were unbreakable.

She couldn't forget that awful summer during her junior year, after the car accident that forced her to take a break from school. The gossip had been brutal—people whispering that she was working shady jobs, or worse, selling herself to make ends meet. It had been hell.

But Hugh stood by her, brushing off the rumors like they were nothing, making it clear to everyone that he was with her, no matter what.

If it weren't for him, those disgusting accusations might've followed her forever.

She'd never had that growing up. Her parents' divorce left her with wounds she didn't even know how to name.

Her mom's fragile health and her stepdad's temper—fueled by booze—made life feel like walking on eggshells every day.

He never cared for the family, only about where his next drink was coming from, and when he got angry, he made sure everyone in the house paid for it.

Marriage, to Melissa, wasn't just about love—it was her ticket to a better life. A safe haven. Not just for her, but for her mom too.

And now? Now she was being thrown away like yesterday's trash because she might not be able to have kids. In this so-called modern world, this was enough to undo everything she and Hugh had built.

The word infertile sent a shiver through Lillian, but she quickly swallowed her shock.

Her voice softened, steady but full of determination. ""Melissa, baby, stop crying. Just come home, okay? We'll figure this out. Together.""

Melissa nodded, even though her tears hadn't stopped. Her mom's voice was like a warm blanket around her frayed nerves, and for the first time all day, she felt a tiny sliver of hope.

At least she still had her mom.

Husband or no husband, Melissa wasn't about to let life chew her up and spit her out. If Hugh wanted out, fine. She'd pick herself up, find a job, and build her own life. She didn't need a savior. She'd be her own hero—and protect her mom in the process.

Melissa pushed open the beat-up door of her dingy little apartment, and the sour, unmistakable stink of alcohol hit her like a slap. She gagged, wrinkling her nose in disgust.

""Drunk again,"" she muttered under her breath, her voice heavy with exhaustion and resignation.

She moved quietly, her steps careful and deliberate, like she was trying to navigate a minefield. All she wanted was to sneak into her room without stirring up the hornet's nest.

""Hey! Don't you fucking move!"" The shout came like a whip crack, sharp and ice-cold, freezing her in place.

Her heart jumped into her throat as she slowly turned around, dread creeping up her spine.

Jack Walton, her stepfather was staggering toward her, weaving unsteadily, but still managing to look threatening as hell. ""So, it's true,"" he growled, his words slurred but still venomous. ""The Wallaker family broke off the damn engagement? What the fuck did you do this time, huh?""

Melissa's stomach churned. Her pulse hammered in her ears as she tried to find the right words to diffuse the situation. Arguing would only make things worse, but she couldn't figure out how she explained something like this.

""I... I need to talk to Mom,"" she stammered, her voice shaking as her eyes darted toward the half-open door of the master bedroom.

She caught a glimpse of Lillian's dress peeking through the crack, and hope surged in her chest. She edged toward the bedroom, desperate for escape. But escape wasn't in the cards.

She'd barely made it two steps when a sharp, searing pain ripped through her scalp. She cried out in shock as Jack's hand yanked her back by the hair.

""Don't you fucking walk away from me!"" he snarled, his grip like iron. ""Answer me, goddamn it! Why did the Wallakers call it off? What'd you do? What's your fucking excuse this time? You cheating on him, you little whore?""

The accusation hit her harder than the pull on her hair. Tears sprang to her eyes as anger and humiliation bubbled to the surface.

""No! That's not true!"" she cried, her voice cracking. ""I wasn't cheating! I was just delivering wedding invitations to my classmates!""

""Bullshit!"" he spat, his voice rising as his hand tightened. ""I saw you yesterday, laughing it up with some guy like you didn't have a care in the fucking world. Don't you dare lie to me!""

Melissa's whole body trembled as she tried to pull away, her voice trembling. ""It wasn't like that! I swear to God!""

He ignored her, his voice growing louder and nastier. ""You think I don't know you? You've been spreading your legs for any guy who looks at you twice! You think I'm blind? Jesus Christ, I actually thought you were trying to clean up your act, but no—same old useless slut! After all I've done for you!

""And now, with the Wallakers out of the picture, you think you can just stay here for free? Hell no. You're gonna start pulling your weight.""

Before she could process his words, he grabbed the front of her shirt and ripped it down the middle.

Melissa gasped, crossing her arms over her chest instinctively. Her entire body shook with terror as she saw the look in his eyes now—hungry, predatory, disgusting.

""No!"" she screamed, thrashing as hard as she could. ""Mom! Mom, help me! Please!"" But the house stayed silent.

Jack laughed, low and mean. ""You really think she's coming to save you? She can hear you just fine, sweetheart. And if she ain't coming out, you already know why. Now, be a good girl, and maybe I won't throw you and your useless mother out on the street.""

Her blood ran cold. She twisted and fought with everything she had, her voice hoarse from screaming. ""Mom! Please! Help me! Mom!""

Out of the corner of her eye, she caught movement. Her mother—Lillian Clayton—was standing in the doorway of the master bedroom, her pale face just visible through the crack.

For one brief, heart-stopping moment, their eyes met. Then the door closed. Softly. Quietly. Finally.

The sound shattered something inside Melissa. She stared at the door, her mind reeling with disbelief. Her chest ached as the betrayal washed over her.

The woman she had sacrificed so much for, fought so hard to protect, had abandoned her. Just like that.

Jack's weight bore down on her, his breath hot and foul against her skin.

Something inside her snapped. The fight drained out of her body, leaving her limp and hollow. Tears streamed down her face as she stared at the closed door, her heart breaking into pieces.

Jack's grin twisted into something vile as Melissa dissolved into despair. He pressed down harder, his weight like a crushing anchor, his hands fumbling clumsily with his belt.

The sour reek of alcohol poured off him, thick and nauseating, choking the air between them. Melissa gagged, bile rising in her throat. 'This isn't happening. It can't be real.' Her chest tightened, panic clawing at her insides.

She twisted her head, desperate for anything—any escape. That's when she saw it: a fruit knife, glinting innocuously on the coffee table just a few feet away.

Her trembling hand darted out, fingers curling around the cold, unforgiving metal. She gripped it tight, but the weight of the blade sent her mind spiraling.

Her stomach churned. She hated blood—hated violence. She couldn't even bring herself to kill a fly, and now she was supposed to stab someone? The thought made her hands freeze, the knife shaking in her grip.

But her stepfather wasn't waiting. His pants were already halfway down his legs, his drunken, clumsy hands yanking and pulling at her clothes.

Something snapped. Melissa let out a broken cry, her chest heaving as she clenched her teeth. Tears blurred her vision, but she didn't care. With a surge of blind, desperate fury, she raised the knife and drove it straight into his back.

""Ah, fuck!"" His scream ripped through the air. He reeled back, clutching at his back as blood seeped through his shirt. He staggered, his breath ragged, but the fury in his eyes only burned hotter.

""You little bitch!"" he snarled, his voice slurred and feral. ""You think this is gonna stop me?!"" He stumbled toward her, hands reaching, his face twisted into something monstrous.

Melissa scrambled to her feet, her whole body shaking like a leaf in the wind. The knife trembled in her hand, its weight unfamiliar and terrifying. ""Stay back!"" she screamed, her voice cracking. ""I swear to God, I'll use it again! Don't fucking come near me!""

But he didn't stop. He wasn't listening. ""You're dead, you hear me? You're fucking dead!"" he roared, spit flying from his lips as he lunged at her.

Melissa's breath hitched. Her legs felt like jelly, her heart pounding so hard it threatened to burst. She shut her eyes tight and thrust the knife forward, blind and wild.

This time, the blade struck true. It plunged into his chest with a sickening crunch. His body jerked, his breath catching in a horrible gurgle.

For a moment, his eyes locked on hers, wide with shock, before the fire drained out of them. He stumbled back, his knees buckling as his weight collapsed into itself. Then he hit the floor. Hard.

Melissa froze. She couldn't move, couldn't breathe. Her fingers went limp, the knife clattering to the floor beside her. The world around her blurred into nothing but the sight of his lifeless body, blood pooling dark and thick beneath him.

Then came the sound of a door slamming open. ""Melissa!"" Her mother's voice ripped through the stillness, sharp and panicked. Lillian stormed into the room, her eyes darting wildly between Melissa and the bloodied corpse on the floor. She marched straight to Melissa, snatched the knife from her hand, and flung it across the room.

""That's your stepfather, you stupid, ungrateful brat!"" Lillian screamed, pointing a trembling finger at the body. ""Do you have any idea what you've just done? He's the one who's kept a roof over our heads all these years! The one who's fed you! And you—what, you just fucking stab him?!""

Melissa stared at her, her cheek throbbing, her chest heaving. The words hit her harder than the slap. Her mother wasn't angry about what had almost happened. She wasn't furious about what he had done.

# 2.Chapter 2 Against The World

Melissa stared down at Jack's lifeless body sprawled on the floor. Blood had already seeped to the tips of her shoes, cold and sticky, clinging like guilt itself.

Her knees gave out, and she crumpled onto the floor, her hands trembling uncontrollably. ""Shit... I killed him. I fucking killed him...""

Melissa, pale as death, clutched at a stray piece of clothing to cover herself, her fingers fumbling like they didn't belong to her anymore. With a ragged breath, she stumbled to her feet, her legs shaky and unsteady.

All she could do was run—out of the house, out of the nightmare she couldn't wake up from.

By the time she reached the bridge, her body was moving, but her mind felt like it wasn't even there anymore. Everything around her was a blur, muted and distant, like she was trapped in someone else's bad dream.

Blood. His face. That awful, sickening finality. She knew it was only a matter of time. The cops were probably already out there, scouring the city, sirens blaring, her name crackling over their radios.

They'd catch her. Drag her into some courtroom where strangers would dissect her life, argue over whether she was a monster or just desperate.

Her eyes drifted to the river below. The water churned and rolled like it was waiting for her, dark and restless. One step. That's all it would take. 'One step, and it's all over,' she thought.

The guilt. The fear. The shame. The suffocating weight of it all. It would disappear the second she sank into the cold depths.

She climbed over the railing, her bare feet gripping the slick metal. Rain was starting to fall now, icy droplets running down her face and soaking her to the bone.

Until she heard it. A sound, faint and almost lost in the wind, but unmistakable. A cry.

Melissa's eyes snapped open. For a moment, she thought she'd imagined it. But then it came again—soft, pitiful, barely audible through the pounding rain.

She turned her head, scanning the bridge. And there it was. A small bundle, not far away, lying forgotten and abandoned in the shadows. It was a baby.

""Waa... waa..."" The cry was weak, fragile, like it barely had the strength to keep going.

Melissa let out a sharp, bitter laugh. 'You've gotta be kidding me,' she muttered under her breath. 'What the hell are you crying about? No one's coming for you, kid. Just like no one's coming for me.'

But the sound of the baby's cries clawed at her, refusing to let go.

She tried to turn back toward the river, to focus on the plan she'd already made. But that tiny, helpless sound stuck to her like a curse. It wound itself around her chest, digging into places she didn't want to feel.

The rain came harder now, pouring in thick sheets, but the baby's cries grew fainter, as though it didn't have much left. Melissa gritted her teeth, her hands clutching the railing until her knuckles turned white.

""Fuck,"" she whispered under her breath. The curse slipped out like a prayer, desperate and raw. She let out a shaky sigh, then swung her legs back over the railing. Her body felt heavy as lead as she staggered toward the tiny bundle.

When she reached it, she dropped to her knees, her heart pounding against her ribs. The baby was so small, wrapped in a damp, dirty blanket, its face pale and cold. It wasn't crying anymore—just making soft, fragile noises, like it didn't have the strength to do anything else.

Melissa hesitated, her hands shaking, before finally reaching out. She pulled the baby into her arms, holding it close. Tentatively, she pressed her finger to its lips, and the baby latched on, sucking weakly.

""You poor little thing,"" she murmured, her voice cracking. Tears welled up in her eyes, mixing with the rain streaming down her face. ""Thrown out like trash, huh? Just like me.""

The baby let go of her finger, its cries starting up again—sharp and desperate, cutting through the rain like a knife. Melissa's heart twisted painfully.

""You're hungry,"" she whispered, her voice breaking. ""I know, I know... I'll figure something out. Just don't give up, okay? Don't give up on me.""

The baby's cries softened a little, but its tiny body was still trembling, fragile and helpless in her arms. Melissa cradled it closer, pressing her cheek to its cold, damp forehead.

""We're both screwed, aren't we?"" she muttered bitterly, her lips twitching into the faintest hint of a smile. ""Left behind. Forgotten.""

'Alright,' she thought, standing on shaky legs. 'Guess we're in this together now. You and me against the world, huh? Let's see if we can make it out of this mess.'

\*\*\*\*\*

Three years later, in a sleepy little town in Lachlan, life trudged along quietly, tucked into the cracks of an old street.

In a shabby house, another chapter of a small, complicated life unfolded.

Melissa, wearing a slightly worn apron, leaned against the window frame. Her tone was firm but still gentle as she called down to the rowdy kids tearing up the yard below. ""Curtis! Dinner's on the table—get your little butt inside!""

Covered in dirt from head to toe, Curtis Bush looked like he'd just climbed out of a mud pit. His toy gun clutched tightly in one hand, he didn't bother looking up. ""Yeah, yeah, I heard you!"" he shouted, too caught up in his pretend war to care.

Melissa exhaled, shaking her head as she turned back into the kitchen. The plates clattered softly as she arranged them on the table. When the doorway stayed empty, her patience hit its limit.

She stormed out onto the balcony, her voice sharp enough to cut through the racket outside. ""Curtis Bush, I said now! Move it!""

The instant she used his full name, every kid in the yard froze. Full-name warnings from a mom meant only one thing: you were about two seconds away from real trouble.

Curtis let out a long, exaggerated sigh. ""Don't go anywhere,"" he said to his friends, sounding like a middle-aged man with too much on his plate. ""I'll eat fast and be back before you even notice I'm gone.""

That cracked the older boys up. They were doubled over, laughing so hard they could barely breathe. ""Curtis is such a little mama's boy!"" one of them howled. ""His mom calls, and he comes running like a scared little puppy!""

""Yeah, other kids are scared of their dads, but Curtis? He's terrified of his mom!""

""And he doesn't even have a dad!"" another chimed in, his voice dripping with mockery.

That hit different. Curtis, halfway to the stairs with a grin on his face, froze mid-step. His smile vanished, replaced by a look that was way too serious for a three-year-old. Slowly, he turned around, his small frame tense like a coiled spring.

""Shut the hell up!"" he yelled, gripping his toy gun so tight his knuckles turned white. ""Don't you dare talk about my mom like that!""

The biggest boy in the group crossed his arms, smirking. He was older, taller, and clearly used to being the boss. ""Or what? Everyone knows your dad ditched you. He's never shown up—not once.""

Another boy snickered, piling on. ""Yeah, and what about that creepy guy down the street? Didn't he say he'd marry your mom? Maybe you should start calling him daddy.""

Curtis might've been little, but he wasn't stupid. He could hear the venom behind their words. This wasn't teasing—it was mean, deliberate, and aimed straight at his heart. His face turned bright red, his whole body shaking with anger.

""You call him daddy! You and your whole family can call him daddy!"" Curtis snapped, his voice cracking.

That just made them laugh harder. ""Why would we? We already have dads,"" one of them shot back, his tone cruel. ""You're the one who doesn't. We were being nice, and now you're acting like a little brat. Maybe your mom does like the lame guy down the street. Maybe she's just waiting to say yes!""

Before Curtis could respond, a new voice cut through the laughter—cold and sharp, like the crack of a whip. ""And what exactly makes you little assholes think you're so special? A bunch of nasty brats with no manners, running your mouths like you own the place. Pathetic.""

The boys whipped around to see Melissa standing at the top of the stairs, her face like thunder. In one hand, she gripped a broom, and she didn't hesitate.

She charged down into the yard, swinging it like she was clearing out pests. The boys scattered, tripping over their own feet as they bolted.

Once the yard was clear, Melissa scooped Curtis up in her arms. But even as she stepped inside, the sound of gossip drifted through the thin walls of the neighborhood.

""She's got some damn nerve, acting all high and mighty,"" someone muttered loud enough to be heard. ""Everyone knows she doesn't even know who the kid's dad is. Bringing their mess here like it's not a disgrace.""

Melissa's jaw clenched so hard it hurt. But her grip on Curtis didn't falter, and her pace didn't slow. She refused to give them the satisfaction of seeing her break.

Back inside, she set Curtis down, finally noticing the way his lip was trembling and his little hands were clenched into fists. He wasn't crying, but his face was pale, and his big eyes glistened with unshed tears.

She knelt in front of him, resting her hands on his shoulders. ""Hey,"" she said softly, her voice steady even though her heart was breaking. ""my little guy, no tears, okay? We didn't do anything wrong. You hear me? Nothing. So don't you cry.""

Curtis hiccupped through his sobs, his little shoulders trembling. ""Mom...I just... I wish Dad was still here..."" His voice broke as he dissolved into hiccupping sobs.

The words hit her like a freight train. Melissa fought to keep the sharp sting of pain off her face. She'd worked so hard to keep Curtis from thinking about the man she was so desperate to forget.

It had been years since she'd grabbed her baby and run, fleeing to Lachlan, the middle of nowhere, to escape a life she could never go back to.

She'd spun a careful story, telling Curtis that his dad was a truck driver who'd died in an accident shortly after they were married. A clean, simple lie to keep him from asking questions that could lead to answers too dangerous to speak out loud.

Melissa hugged him closer, her voice steady despite the lump in her throat. ""Baby, your daddy's watching over us from heaven. He loves you so much, Curtis, and he wouldn't want to see you sad like this. Okay?""

Curtis sniffled and nodded, his wide, tear-filled eyes searching hers. ""I don't want Daddy to be sad...""

Her heart twisted again, but before she could say more, a car horn cut through the heavy quiet outside.

Normally, Curtis would've been off her lap in a flash, rushing to the balcony to see what kind of car it was. He was obsessed with cars—he could pick out makes and models just from the sound of an engine.

But today, he stayed put, burrowing deeper into her arms.

Melissa forced a smile and kissed the top of his head. ""Come on, buddy. Let's go see what's out there, huh? Maybe it's something cool.""

She stood and carried him to the balcony. Her eyes instantly locked on two sleek black sedans sitting in her dusty front yard.

Her stomach sank when she caught sight of the license plates—Chassis. A city miles away, too far for this to be a casual visit.

Her mind started racing. She hadn't seen a car from Chassis in years. Memories she'd buried long ago surged to the surface: the blood pooling on the floor, her stepfather's cold, lifeless body.

'Why now? Why here? Have they finally caught up with me?' she thought in a picnic.

Melissa's grip on Curtis tightened as dread washed over her. Back then, she'd had nothing to lose, no one to protect but herself.

But now, everything was different. She had Curtis. The thought of leaving him behind, of him facing this cruel world without her, was unbearable.

Her instinct screamed at her to retreat, to grab her boy and run again, but before she could so much as step back, the rear door of one of the sedans creaked open.

And out stepped a man. Melissa froze.

The summer heat shimmered around him, but he looked utterly untouched by it, his crisp, tailored suit clinging to his broad shoulders and lean frame like it was made for him.

His every movement was smooth, deliberate, exuding an effortless confidence that couldn't be faked. He wasn't just handsome; he was devastating.

He paused to adjust his cuffs with a deliberate, practiced ease before lifting his head. His eyes swept across the balcony. And then his gaze locked on her.

Melissa felt her breath hitch. His eyes were cold and unnervingly sharp, like he could see right through her.

# 3.Chapter 3 Got Moore Blood In You

Melissa bolted back into the house from the balcony, her movements sharp and hurried. ""Curtis, wash up—it's dinner time,"" she called, keeping her tone as steady as she could manage.

But her mind was miles away. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't shake the image of that car's license plate or the unnervingly intense stare of the man behind the wheel. A prickly, unfamiliar unease coiled in her gut, refusing to let go.

The knock at the door came suddenly, loud and aggressive, making her flinch. Her pulse skyrocketed, a cold sweat breaking out along her spine.

For a moment, she just stood there, frozen, her breathing shallow. Relax, she told herself, even as her hand shook slightly when she reached for the doorknob.

She opened the door—and there he was. The man from the car.

Tall and broad-shouldered, he filled the doorway with an imposing presence that made her instinctively want to step back. His cologne hit her first—subtle, expensive, and irritatingly familiar.

It stirred a memory she couldn't quite place, like a ghost brushing past her. Her stomach tightened. She didn't know him. She was sure of that.

But there was something about the way he stood, so calm and self-assured, like he owned the damn world, that sent a chill rippling through her.

Melissa gripped the doorframe for support and forced herself to speak. ""Can I help you? Are you... looking for someone?""

The man's eyes locked onto hers, steady and unyielding. ""Yeah,"" he said, his voice low and deliberate. ""You.""

That single word knocked the air out of her lungs. She blinked, trying to gather her thoughts, her grip tightening. ""You've got the wrong person,"" she said quickly, her voice a little too high-pitched to sound convincing.

His lips curled into a faint, humorless smile. ""No, I don't. Melissa Bush. Don't tell me you've forgotten what you did three years ago.""

Her heart stopped. Just like that, her world tipped on its axis. Three years ago. The words crashed into her like a truck, dredging up memories she'd fought so hard to bury.

Her eyes darted toward the living room, toward Curtis's toys scattered on the floor. 'If he knows...' Her chest tightened painfully. 'If they take me... Curtis. What happens to him?'

Her hands trembled at the thought. The idea of her little boy being ripped from her, tossed into foster care, growing up alone—it was unbearable.

""I don't know what you're talking about,"" she said, but her voice cracked halfway through. Her pale face and shaking hands told a different story.

The man, Bradley Moore, rolled his eyes, his patience clearly nonexistent. ""Cut the bullshit,"" he said, his tone sharp enough to slice through her weak protest.

Before she could respond, he shoved the door open, brushing past her like it was his house, not hers.

""What the hell are you doing?"" Melissa snapped, scrambling to block his path. ""Get out! You can't just barge into someone's house!""

He ignored her completely. His sharp eyes swept over the modest living room, taking in every detail.

The mismatched furniture, the small dining table with two steaming plates, the bookshelf crammed with kids' books—it all painted a picture of a simple, quiet life.

His gaze landed on the toy bin overflowing with blocks and stuffed animals. A faint smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth.

Without a word, he strolled to the couch and sank into it like he owned the thing, one arm casually slung over the backrest. He patted the seat next to him, raising an eyebrow. ""Sit.""

Melissa bristled, her jaw tightening as she stood frozen by the door. She didn't move. ""You've got the wrong person,"" she said again, her voice cold but tight with unease. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

Bradley leaned forward slightly, resting his elbows on his knees, his gaze locked on her like a predator sizing up prey. ""Three years,"" he said slowly, his tone almost conversational. ""It took me three goddamn years to find you. You think I'm leaving without what's mine?""

Melissa's face twisted in a mix of confusion and disbelief as her thoughts tumbled over each other. ""What's mine? What the hell does he mean? Wait a second—he's not a cop? He didn't come here to bust me?'

The whirlwind of questions sparked an unexpected surge of boldness, and before she could think twice, the words flew out of her mouth. ""What the hell are you even talking about? I don't know you, I've never seen you before in my life!""

His expression darkened, and the air in the room seemed to drop a few degrees. ""Give me back my son.""

The words hit like a sledgehammer. For a second, Melissa forgot how to breathe. She staggered back, her hand gripping the edge of the dining table for support.

""Your... son?"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""I don't... I don't know what you're talking about.""

Bradley's patience had clearly hit its limit. He turned, motioning toward the bathroom door where a pair of curious little eyes peeked through the crack. ""Milton, come here.""

Melissa could only watch, frozen, as the door creaked open and Curtis stepped out hesitantly. A cold, paralyzing fear gripped her chest.

There was something undeniable between this man and her son—some unspoken, invisible link she couldn't ignore.

Curtis shuffled over to her, his tiny hand clutching the hem of her shirt like a lifeline. ""Mommy, who's that man?""

Melissa pulled him close, holding him tight against her. Her gaze never left Bradley, every fiber of her being screaming caution.

'But... hadn't Curtis been abandoned as a baby? Wasn't there a note in his blanket—'We can't afford to raise him'—a cold, heartless explanation for why he'd been left behind?' she mused internally.

And yet, here stood this man, driving a car worth more than most people's houses. He didn't look like someone who couldn't afford a pack of diapers.

More than that, his whole presence, his every movement, oozed wealth and sophistication. That wasn't something you could fake, let alone pick up in a couple of years.

Melissa hadn't even managed to come up with a lie to soothe Curtis when Bradley's voice cut through the tension. ""I'm your father.""

The words landed like a punch to the gut. She'd had her suspicions, sure—but hearing him say it out loud? It knocked the air out of her lungs. Her knees wobbled, and she nearly hit the floor.

Her body shook uncontrollably, trembling like a leaf caught in a storm.

On paper, she was the one who had saved Curtis when he was abandoned as a baby. But in truth, he'd been the one keeping her alive all these years, the reason she fought so hard just to survive.

Melissa opened her mouth, but no words came out. All she could do was hold Curtis tighter, as though sheer force could shield him from whatever was coming.

""You're my dad?"" Curtis's eyes sparkled with cautious excitement, his voice full of innocent curiosity.

Bradley's lips curved into the slightest smile, clearly satisfied with the reaction. ""That's right.""

Curtis tilted his head, studying the man as if trying to solve a puzzle. Finally, he blurted out, ""But... aren't you supposed to be dead?""

Bradley's brow twitched slightly. His gaze flicked toward Melissa, who stood frozen like a statue. Then he turned back to Curtis. ""What else did she tell you?""

Curtis's little fingers began counting as he answered earnestly, ""She said you're a super good driver, you can cook, and... you love her a lot!""

Bradley's lips curled into a sharp, mocking smile. ""Take all the time you need,"" he drawled, his tone cool and cutting. ""You'll figure out soon enough what kind of man your father really is.""

His words hit like a slap. Curtis, wide-eyed and hesitant, turned to Melissa, his voice trembling with confusion. ""Mommy... is he really my daddy? He's alive?""

Melissa froze, panic overtaking her. She shook her head so hard it was a wonder it didn't come loose. ""No, no, he's not—he's not your daddy!""

Bradley's expression darkened in an instant, the air in the room seeming to drop several degrees. His voice was icy and sharp. ""So, not only are you a thief, but you're a liar too?""

Melissa's shaking grew worse. She looked small, fragile, as she stumbled over her words. ""No, no... it's not like that... I didn't steal... he's mine...""

Her voice broke, and tears brimmed in her eyes. She looked so small, so helpless, that Curtis's chest tightened. This wasn't the mommy he knew—the strong, loving, sometimes stern mommy who always had everything under control. Right now, she looked broken.

Something clicked in Curtis's young mind. This man—this tall, scary man with his harsh words and cruel eyes—had to be a bad guy.

With sudden determination, Curtis stepped forward, planting his small body in front of Melissa. He threw his arms out as wide as they would go and glared up at Bradley. ""You're a bad man!"" he shouted, his voice shaking but firm. ""You're not my daddy! Get out of my house!""

Bradley's eyes narrowed, his irritation flashing like lightning. His voice turned sharper, louder. ""Ungrateful little brat! Protecting an outsider? I'm your father, whether you like it or not.""

Curtis flinched but didn't back down. His little jaw tightened as he stomped over to the corner, grabbing his toy gun.

Though his hands trembled, he aimed it straight at Bradley, his face set in childish defiance. ""You're lying! You're a bad man, and you can't hurt my mommy! Get out, or—or I'll shoot you!""

Bradley blinked, startled for a split second, before a deep laugh rumbled from his chest. ""Well, well,"" he said, amusement flickering in his cold eyes. ""At least you've got some Moore blood in you.""

For a moment, Curtis faltered, lowering the toy gun slightly. That hesitation was all Bradley needed. In one swift move, he reached out, grabbed the toy gun from Curtis's hands, and tossed it aside without a second thought.

His smirk vanished as his voice turned razor-sharp. ""Enough of this bullshit."" Snapping his fingers, he signaled to the two men waiting just outside the door. ""Take them.""

Chaos erupted instantly. Before Melissa could react, Bradley scooped Curtis up in one arm, his grip unyielding.

The two large men stormed in, each grabbing one of Melissa's arms and lifting her off the ground like she weighed nothing.

The room filled with frantic screams.

""Curtis!"" Melissa cried, her voice raw with desperation.

""Mommy! Mommy, I want my mommy!"" Curtis yelled, his small fists pounding against Bradley's chest.

Tears streamed down Curtis's face as he fought with everything he had, but Bradley's hold was like steel. Desperation surged in him, and with no other option, he sank his teeth into Bradley's neck, biting down as hard as he could.

# 4.Chapter 4 She's Not Your Mother

""Hiss—"" Bradley winced in pain, his gaze turning sharp as a knife. ""You little brat, is this how she's been teaching you?""

Curtis glared at him, fists clenched in fury. ""You're not my dad! Let go of me!""

Bradley's voice hardened, low and threatening. ""Listen up, Milton Moore. I'm your real father. That woman? She's not your mother!""

The words hit Curtis like a punch to the gut. He completely lost it, thrashing wildly, kicking and screaming. ""Liar! She is my mom! Let go of me, you bastard!""

'How could she not be my mother?' Curtis's panic surged, his cries becoming even louder, more desperate.

Bradley, completely losing his patience, gripped the bloodstained spot on his neck and pulled Curtis in even tighter.

Outside, a luxury car stood parked in the driveway. The noise upstairs was enough to draw a crowd, and soon, the yard was full of nosy neighbors, whispering and gossiping.

Curtis was shoved into one car, while Melissa was taken to another.

An elderly woman, watching the chaos unfold, finally gathered the courage to speak. ""Who the hell are you people? You can't just steal people like this... it's illegal!""

Bradley remained unfazed, casually pulling out a handkerchief to wipe the blood from his neck. ""I'm working a case. Mind your own business.""

The crowd quickly pieced it together, and whispers spread like wildfire.

""No wonder no one ever visits them. They must be hiding out because they're running from the law.""

""Oh my God, my kid's always hanging out with that troublemaker. I hope he doesn't get dragged into something bad.""

The crowd muttered, pointing at Melissa, who was banging on the car window, fighting to break free.

The car tore off, kicking up dust as it sped away.

After what felt like forever, Melissa, exhausted from crying, realized there was no way out. She stopped, her sobs turning into quiet sniffles.

Her red, swollen eyes narrowed at Bradley. ""Pretending to be a cop? That's a crime.""

Bradley Moore turned to her with a smirk, his tone teasing. ""When did I say I was a cop?""

Melissa shot back, biting with anger. ""You said you were working a case!""

Bradley chuckled darkly. ""What, a private investigator can't investigate a case?""

Melissa was left speechless, caught off guard.

Bradley pulled out an iPad, swiping it to pull up her information. ""Melissa Bush. Graduated from Chassis University. You were supposed to marry your boyfriend, but canceled the wedding the day before.""

He gave her a mocking smile. ""The media even covered it for a couple of days.""

Melissa looked at the screen, her nerves suddenly shot to hell.

It was obvious that Bradley hadn't dug deep enough into her past. If he had, he would've known the one thing that kept her up at night: the murder of her stepfather.

That secret was enough to bring her to her knees.

Melissa took a deep breath, her voice tight. ""What the hell do you want from me?""

Bradley's eyes were as cold as ice. ""Can't you figure it out? I want you to bring my son back and, while you're at it, I need you to tell me what the hell you've been doing all this time.""

Melissa fought to keep her composure. ""Are you seriously Curtis's real father?""

""He's Milton Moore!"" Bradley snapped, his tone sharp.

Melissa raised an eyebrow. ""And why the hell should I believe you?""

Bradley's voice dropped to a chilling, flat tone. ""We'll do a DNA test. You can take one too, if it makes you feel better.""

Melissa's heart skipped a beat. She knew well she wasn't related to Curtis by blood, and there was no way she was going near a DNA test.",1,1752823043.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I live with my parents and am I’m preparing for an entrance and the plan is to be in his city after the exam. Now the exam was in June last year but I unfortunately fractured my leg on the very morning of the exam so we were pushed back by a year. We somehow made it through that phase of disappointment, and fights and frustration and things looked okay again. As more and time passes, we both are actually getting increasingly restless and argumentative. Now this year my exam got postponed by 1.5 months and I decided that it wasn’t a big deal and that I will maintain my composure as it’s just a postponement and I will not let this ruin my focus on the studies. He apparently got greatly hit by the news but chose not to express his disappointment and put up a normal face. So I didn’t know he was going through so much. He started going on weekend trips with his friends and I liked the idea since he used to feel very lonely on weekends alone in his house. He would often express how he wished I were there. So amidst this depression which I was unaware of, on one of these trips, he adopted a puppy, thinking a pet would fill the void and give him the love that he’s been missing. And I totally understand that. To see one’s friends happily married and to wait just to be in a regular relationship can be taxing. Now the thing is, he has gotten so involved in the pet, that he says things like “I won’t be able to cuddle with you now since you don’t have fur and I need fur, and “she is so much more beautiful than you”. In the beginning I used to laugh along and not think much of those. Found it all too cute tbh. But this one time, he said ‘the way she licks me and loves me in the morning, you’re going to be so insecure and jealous. I can’t wait to see you be the third wheel.’ That’s when I first felt slightly hurt. Since then, every night when we video call, he speaks to me like I’m a rival team. He looks more energetic than ever and sits ready to make fun of me for everything. It’s getting so hard to speak to him. We spoke at night because we were each others’ peace right before sleeping. Now talking to him stresses me out. Everything is a competition for him. He has to declare me wrong all the time. Like yesterday, he said jokingly about the dog, ‘she is too beautiful to be a middle class dog’, and I played along saying ‘I agree. Once I come over there I’m going to pamper her with all the luxuries I can so she can feel like her upper class self.’ I said this laughingly. And he immediately said ‘try all you want but she will always love me more. She doesn’t care about money.’ I WAS LIKE WHAT. So I said “don’t be so insecure about her. You’ll always be her favourite person no matter what so you can relax.” And he said “I’m not insecure I’m just joking. But sure. It takes analytic skills to understand what one means. And doctors (I’m a doc) don’t have that. Professions actually decide how a person thinks and engineers (he is one) are wired to think in an algorithm.” I was just dumbfounded. He often teases me by calling me dumb. So I got a little annoyed and I was like “yeah I know you’re Einstein and I’m dumb. You don’t have to look for new ways of telling me that.” Then I calmed down somehow. And went on to tell him how I went from being a hard core coffee lover to two timing between tea and coffee. It was supposed to be a funny story of how my hatred for tea turned into an affair and how I cheated on coffee🤌🏼. I made it sound so story like and funny. And like everyday, he targeted genz as a generation and called them fickle minded. He was like you people are just so weird and indecisive. And I just rolled my eyes at that reaction and went to sleep. It’s like this every single night now. He manages to piss me off and I go to sleep angry. EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. and the next morning he pretends like everything is fine. Talking to him is so stressful these days. I just never know how he’s going to piss me off. Or what I say might piss him off. I speak less to avoid conflict. And he gets mad at that too for not being myself. He calls all this harmless banter. But trust me it ruins my mood. I really don’t think this is banter. I am just grossly frustrated at my life and he let alone help, makes it worse. Am I the one being the jerk here? I don’t know. I just want to fix this. Whatever it takes. I love him. And I don’t enjoy disliking him. I just want everything to be okay. ",4,1752822698.0,AskIndianWomen,3,0.83,False
1m2vo2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/1m2vo2c/about_ni_function/,About NI Function.,"# Some words before main body:

\*\*\*\*\*I don't think this is a 'think' which is rationally and about rational things. This text is about this NI or SI, introvertive perceiving funtion, which is 'IRRATIONAL'.    I don't think there's any, ANY detailed description attemption(which is always patient, kind and respect) will help, because outlining its specific structure seems technically impossible, Which means using rational languages to describe a irrational thing, using language in rational ways to describe irrational things.\*\*\*

Sorry for my poor English. I'm not a native English speaker and have not studied English seriously. The reason why I don't use AI translation for all this text is, AI always change words to aesthetic or professional approach, which will twist my meaning, and I cannot distinguish them (T\_T). Even if this means my word will keep meaning in an incorrect form, I choose to keep this.

Also, I will not make any citations of Jung's original text (Most comes from other articles of Jung's rather than *the Psychological Types* ). One reason is that I need to find the English version, and the other reason is that the word count is toooooo much to hold (XwX), by adding the explanations of Jung's words, I'm not sure how long it will take.

# Main body:

(I've reordered the ***parts*** to prioritize key information. This might lead to a lack of context, so if you don't mind the trouble and my terrible English (XD), I recommend starting from ""Background message"" and then returning to the other *parts*.)

==============================

***Part: Something about Ni***

(Specific examples are provided in the *part:Background messages*. These examples are difficult to condense here, especially given the environmental factors associated with each one.)

I find Ni is incredibly **difficult to recognize in real-time**. As mentioned in the *part:background massages*, it often takes me days or even half a month to realize I've ""seen"" something, prompting me to explore it in retrospect and uncover hints about my psychological state.

Even without immediate recognition, the trancelike states and unsettling feelings I experience at the moment do, to some extent (albeit a very small one, I'd say), serve as a reminder. But after a period of intentional observation, I've managed to improve my awareness of these states. If when I'm unsure what's happening, I can pause and try to perceive what's unfolding. (**It's actually not as mysterious as it sounds** (the main reason it *seems* mysterious is largely because I used AI for translation, and it improve text's expressive force which is doesn't exist. XD ). **To others, it probably just looks like I suddenly stop, stare at something or zone out, and then a moment later, I just continue walking or working**.)

Perhaps the most useful application for me is in avoiding arguments. I've noticed these intuitions appear more frequently in interpersonal relationships. In fact, I believe this is because relationships **exert greater pressure** on me, **forcing my unconsciousness plane to pay attention to these subtle cues**. btw, A ridiculous fact is, when I'm working on **deadline** for a theory test, I can always find some very small logic problems that makes me hard to understand(in fact, others will just ignore that becuase it's too small/detailed to aware) and efficiency decrease or just stuck on that problem in an **obsessive-compulsive** state. (X\_X)

==============================

**P*****art: About, Extroverted Rational functions as aux function.*** 

To me, these are **constructed things**. They are the language I use to explain and describe things – these logical frameworks and modes of expression, all the analogies and associations. These tools definitely help in conveying what I perceive in a way that is **relatively understandable** to others(In fact, I want to say, to humans XD).

However, the problem is that these constructs can also **erode and distort the original images**, eventually expressing them in a way you barely recognize. **Always, the more I try to concretize and make something understandable, the further the written output deviates from what I truly intend to express**. It can reach a point where it becomes a pure concepts/constructs, **where the concept itself exists independently of the perception,** a whole mass of words and logical analyses that seem to explain something but actually develop themselves in a vacuum, means nothing (perhaps there's a connection here with Baudrillard's ""simulacra""?).

**Most of the time, though, it doesn't get to that extreme.** My thinking functions aren't yet that powerful. **When what I've written deviates from what I want to express to a degree I can't tolerate, becoming more about developing external/extrovertive knowledge, I'll discard or delete it in frustration.** (Later, I'll include three links: examples of my writing where the concept is highly understood/constructed, generally understood/\~, and poorly understood/\~.)

==============================

***Part: Background message***

I find people always try to outlining Ni function(or maybe also Si) more and more percisely, rationally, clearly.... Which means describing : *It's something or not, What logic it's running within, and so on..* . And something more i can't understand: *How it manifests in productivity process, How it work in ones contorl/consciousness, How it helps one grasp the future to money or achievements, and so on...*, which seems 100% constructed things to me.

\\@\_@\\   
To me, the Ni in my thought/mind is like, **daydreaming**.   
Such like, my family and I returned to the countryside. i am bored and the conversations with unfamiliar, or even unacquainted people with cordiality made me anxious. Sometimes people were talking outside room while I was reading inside. **At those times, my attention would occasionally, involuntarily and naturally drift away from the things in front of me (words, papers, temperature, allergies), and I would perceive something. Most of the time, it was too vague, causing me to not remember what I was perceiving afterwards. But in some cases, I would perceive some vague symbols(?), such as feeling a human twisting its body like a fish(looks like internet memes XD), or sensing a circular radiation(rings are encircled by other rings) pattern.** If it were me from years ago, I definitely wouldn't have noticed these things. Maybe I would forget them just after a while. But now, I can realize some things. **For example, the first (image? pattern?) actually represents that I think the way they speak and their tone are very funny (because my inferior Se maybe, XD). The second represents that I feel they are a bit noisy and the sound reverberates in the room, making me feel a little dizzy.**

When I was a child (below 8 years old), I often perceived some fascinating mental images, like a cubic frame slowly rotating in my mind...or somewhat. I barely remember these images now. I suspect this might be due to the development of extroverted judging functions influenced by knowledge-based education. (I'll discuss this further in the next *part: About extroverted rational functions as aux function.* **I should also state that there was a significant gap between the appearance of these images and even a slight understanding of them. This gap could be as short as a few days, or as long as several years, or even until now, I haven't been able to form a satisfactory explanation**.)(edit: I post some thinking about my images in below's link:[a-thought-about-coffee](https://www.infjs.com/threads/a-thought-about-coffee.39803/))

As I got a bit older, I often felt the presence of a ""girl"" in my heart(also I give her a name, but years later I saw they call this""tulpa"".. or something else, on the internet.) Along with this feeling, my actions and thoughts became more reflective. I became more aware of my emotions and was able to calm them down. However, problems also arose from this reflectiveness. Many of my friends often didn't understand what I was talking about. (there was one day, when I was looking through what my classmates wrote in my graduation yearbook under ""say something to me,"" several close friends wrote things like, ""I don't know what you're always talking about,"" ""a bit spaced out,"" or ""often says surprising and hard-to-understand things."" At the time I graduated, I felt very confused reading those comments, but now when I read them, I'm like ""XD"").

*During this period, I began to experience some images that have continued to this day. The more prominent ones include: A black hole with a rotating ring of fire at its edge. White noise, a sensation where all surrounding sounds blur together into an image, looking like mist, though I prefer to call it white noise. And... a difficult-to-describe feeling brought on by moonlight, like being devoured, accepted, but assimilated (this reminds me of Shimeji's fear in the Simeji Simulation, Chapter 43, Page 8: ""I am going to disappear"").*

**So, has Ni not generated anything ""meaningful"" in my life? Perhaps not** (XD), but these phenomena consistently capture my attention. **After each experience, I feel a trigger, which often provides me with either motivation or frustration, prompting me to investigate and reflect on certain aspects.** To be honest, even though these things give me a strong drive, I haven't yet found a somewhat effective way to controlably apply them to objective work content. While I can adjust myself based on certain feelings to adapt to work, this has little to do with the specific content and operations of the job itself.

Occasionally, **I do have some intuition about objective matters**, like finding my way or avoiding danger. Unfortunately, **these insights don't provide me with much motivation, so even when I perceive them, I don't necessarily act on them**. (Perhaps this is due to the differentiation of Ni, where libido tends towards Ni rather than Ne.) I'm often not surprised at all when I make mistakes, because I've already sensed something was off. However, this indifference (or rather, difficulty in acting) often leaves others exasperated or gritting their teeth in frustration.

==============================

***Last:***

Thank you so much for reading this far! I know I've packed a lot of background information in here, and it can definitely feel a bit overwhelming. Plus, I haven't explained many of the concepts, and doing so for each one would probably double the length of this post (and introduce even *more* new concepts XD).

Regardless, I truly appreciate you making it to the end. It would be even better if you could **comment below with any parts of the post you didn't understand**. I'd love to clarify some things, but without feedback, I'll just end up making things even more confusing.",2,1752822673.0,mbti,2,0.67,False

However, he did not feel guilty about his daughter's experience at all as he quickly yelled at me in the first sentence he talked to me, ""Did you know that returning to the ship without permission almost destroyed Yates Corporation's business worth hundreds of millions?!""

""You and our daughter were really selfish.""

My heart clenched and I bit my lip.

""Did you want me to watch my child being bullied by others?""

A trace of surprise flashed across his face and then he changed the subject with a cold look.

""There was a very important party next month and you and Charlotte needed to attend together.""

I paused, shook my head and said, ""I couldn't go.""

After all, next month, I would no longer be his wife as he wished.

""Why couldn’t you go?""

David frowned and then he seemed to understand something.

""Was this it because Charlotte said bad things about Jessica, so I gave her a little lesson and you were giving me a face now?""

""Besides, I told you on the first day of our marriage that I had someone I liked. Don't forget it.""

My heart felt like it had been stabbed and waves of continuous pain emerged. Ten years ago, when my mother told me that David and I were engaged, I had been ecstatic because I had had a crush on him since I was a child. But on the happiest day, David had given me the heaviest blow.

""I had a lover, but she was just an ordinary girl from an ordinary family, so I couldn’t marry her.""

That night, he had been drunk and stared at me coldly.

""I would control the Yates Family within ten years and then no one could stop me! So don’t expect me to fall in love with you. We would automatically divorce after ten years.""

That night, I had signed the contract but cried all night in the cold yard. In the second week of our marriage, Jessica boarded a plane to a foreign country because of a quarrel with David. So, he went on to find her.

At that time, David didn’t go home all night and when he came back, he was always drunk and treated me like nothing. Until that night, he came back drunk again and hugged me passionately. But when he kissed me on the bed, he called Jessica’s name over and over again.

""Jessica, I wouldn’t let you marry anyone else! You could only be mine!"" I cried under him with tears, nails dug into my palms and blood dripped into the sheets.

That was our first night, but David frantically called out another person’s name all night. When I woke up the next day, David saw my red and swollen eyes. He was stunned for a moment and finally got out of bed without saying a word.

I also pretended that nothing had happened, prepared breakfast and work documents for him and sent him out to work. Since then, I had been more considerate.

David was tired and had a stomach disease, so I learned about healthy food and prepared his three meals in person. He was under great pressure at work, so I took the initiative to give up my career, became his subordinate and took on the most tiring work.

Later, we had a daughter and gradually, David seemed to treat me as his wife.

David began to bring me various gifts when he came back from a business trip. He would bring me a glass of milk when I couldn’t sleep. He would even accompany me and my daughter to watch the stars on the terrace late at night.

His hot body temperature covered me from behind like a close lover.

Gradually, it seemed as if we had never signed any divorce agreement. I had naively thought that he might have really fallen in love with me. But more than three months ago, Jessica suddenly returned to the UK with her adopted son, Gregory.

David returned to her side as soon as he heard the news. He spent her birthday with her and accompanied her and Gregory to watch the meteor shower.

He even gave up an important business trip just because Jessica said, ""I had a nightmare … ""

When I saw David letting his daughter suffer such torture for Jessica, I woke up. He had never loved us, his wife and daughter. I gave everything for him, but it couldn’t match the look of his first love. The dream was over and it was time to leave.

""Remember to dress Charlotte nicely when the time comes. Don’t embarrass me and the Yates Family.""

David's voice pulled my thoughts back and I looked at him in a daze.

Didn’t he remember that we automatically canceled the engagement in half a month?

Chapter 2

In the past ten years, the closer I had gotten to the day when the contract expired, the more afraid I had been, fearing that he would abandon me without hesitation when the deadline came. But as the date approached, David never mentioned it.

Just when I had hesitated about whether to take the initiative to ask for a divorce, David's phone suddenly rang with a series of unique ringtones. I had known that he had set it up for Jessica, to ensure that he could receive her call as soon as possible.

As soon as the call connected, Jessica's crying voice came from the other end and David's face suddenly changed.

""Don’t worry, I’ll be there soon.""

David rushed out while speaking. Because he had been too anxious, his shoulder had hit me heavily. I had hit the wall and felt dizzy from the back of my head. But David had ignored it and disappeared quickly.

Half a day later, I recovered and felt a big swelling on the back of my head. I went back to the room silently to apply medicine to myself and tried my best to endure not crying.

I had stayed by my daughter's bed, staring at her sleeping face in the darkening sky, until a burst of laughter came from the yard.

""David, fortunately you arrived in time and rescued me from the broken elevator. Otherwise, the baby might have miscarried.""

Through the window, I saw David holding Jessica's hand and holding Jessica's adopted son with his other strong arm.

He kissed her forehead like kissing his favorite little girl.

""With me protecting you and your son, you never have to be afraid.""

I noticed that the boy, who was about the same age as Charlotte, had a pair of emerald green eyes that were almost the same as Jessica's. He was wearing a well-made tailored clothes, from head to toe, all of them were luxury brands.

My daughter had grown up so big, but she had never worn any luxury goods, just because David always said that he didn’t want others to think we were extravagant.

Jessica's voice came again, ""Do you really want us to move in? What if Catherine is angry? I don’t want to destroy your relationship.""

David paused, his eyes moved slightly and then he said, ""She had no right to say no! As long as I was here, this was your home with the children.""

I grabbed my clothes tightly, laughed at myself and retracted my gaze.

Soon, the familiar footsteps came upstairs. David walked into the house and threw a green skirt into my hand.

""This was for Charlotte. Didn’t she like green the most?""

But my daughter liked blue and hated green the most. He hadn’t understood it at all after seven years. I stared at the skirt without saying anything. David’s face showed a trace of confusion and then he seemed to understand something.

He hugged me from behind and kissed my hair gently.

""I knew I had neglected you and our daughter during this period. I would make it up to you.""

""Jessica had just returned to the UK and had no place to live. I would take her and Gregory over and let them live in our house for a while.""

As my arms tightened, a strong perfume smell came from his body, which made me want to vomit. I pushed him away and smiled coldly.

""Whatever, let whoever you love live.""

My coldness made David frown unhappily and suddenly, a unique ringtone came from his waist.

He immediately loosened his arms around me and answered the phone.

""I had work.""

He turned around, with an irrepressible smile on his face and walked out quickly.

Half an hour later, I received a message from David on my phone.

""Bring me a box of stomach medicine to Yates Club.""

Knowing that he had stomach problems, I didn’t doubt him. When I rushed to the familiar door of the box, I saw through the crack in the door at first glance that in the dim space, Jessica was sitting on David's lap and the two of them were intimately entangled like an inseparable vine.

Several of David's buddies were there.

Suddenly someone asked, ""Now Jessica is back with you and she is pregnant with your child. What if Catherine finds out?""

David frowned slightly and then I heard him sneer.

""She had been like a dog to me since high school. She couldn’t even be forced to leave. So what if she knew?""

Chapter 3

A burst of laughter almost overturned the roof.

Only one man stared at Jessica on David's legs and asked disdainfully, ""Catherine had devoted a full ten years to you. You treated her like this for the woman who had abandoned you in the past. It was too heartless, wasn’t it?""

The next second, the man was hit hard in the face by David.

""I didn’t allow anyone to say that about Jessica! She had been forced to do it in the past. Her parents had married her to someone else, but she never consummated the marriage with that incompetent old man!""

Back then, David had no say in the Yates Family. He had had an elder brother with outstanding abilities. He had thought Jessica left because of jealousy.

But he hadn’t known that it was when Jessica found out that he was not the first heir of the Yates Family that she had left him without hesitation and went abroad.

After I had married David, in order to help him, I had accompanied clients to discuss business and drank so much that my stomach was perforated. I had attended every important meeting with a high fever and negotiated countless big deals.

I had even worked overtime for several weeks while pregnant, just to let him attend the international industry summit with a presentation ...

Over time, his parents had finally favored him. Ten years later, when he had finally taken control of the Yates Corporation business empire, she came back. And I was still just a bootlicker who came and went at his call, a complete joke in his eyes.

I felt a sharp pain in my chest and I instinctively hid in the corridor next to me. In order to protect Jessica, David had abandoned his usual calmness and his furious look with red eyes made everyone in the box dare not breathe.

Then, he picked up Jessica, who was crying in grievance and just as he reached the door, he stopped.

""None of you were allowed to say a word in front of Catherine!""

His voice was cold and firm as he said, ""You must not let her know that the child in Jessica's belly was mine.""

Then, he had hugged his crying mistress and left.

But where he couldn’t see, Jessica had cast a smug and arrogant look at me. I finally understood that the text message had been sent to me by Jessica on his phone so that I could see it all. I had walked on the street in a daze for a long, long time.

When I got home, I was stopped by Jessica in the corridor.

""Did you know? Every year on my birthday, he flew to accompany me just to give me a gift. Last year it was a Chanel necklace and the year before it was the latest limited edition Patek Philippe watch …""

""Those were all the styles I mentioned on social platforms that I liked and he actually remembered them all the time.""

""But I had deliberately gotten angry with him and thrown those gifts to him directly. In the end, I could get something more valuable than them. This man’s hot, vigorous, sexy body and his heart that was always in love with me and couldn’t stop.""

My fingers suddenly tightened and my nails sank deeply into my palm.

I remembered clearly that on those days every year, David had said he was going on a business trip abroad even though I didn’t see any arrangements on his work schedule.

Last year, he had brought a Chanel necklace. The year before, an expensive Patek Philippe watch …

I had been so happy that I put them all in my cabinet and couldn’t bear to wear them. But it turned out that he gave them to me after Jessica didn’t want them anymore.

Jessica continued to hurt my eardrums, ""Also, eight years ago on Christmas, I had a big fight with my then-husband and he actually flew over overnight and stayed outside my house in the snow for a whole night.""

I remembered that Christmas Eve. David had asked me for sex many times, contrary to his usual behavior and I had thought he finally started to fall in love with me.

When I woke up the next day, the pillow had already been cold and he had said he was on an urgent business trip and I hadn’t doubted it at all. It was also on that night that we had a daughter …

Now, I finally knew that David had forgotten to give me the contraceptive pill that day, just because he had been in a hurry to see Jessica?!

Chapter 4

Jessica raised a thick stack of letters in her hand,

""Over the years, I had deliberately not contacted him. But he had never forgotten me for a day and wrote me love letters every day, even though I never replied.""

I felt breathless. How many late nights had I seen him writing in the study, thinking he was handling official business, so I made coffee for him and sent it in.

It turned out that he had been telling Jessica his heart. It turned out that from beginning to end, the heart I had thought was finally warmed up had never had me. I couldn’t listen anymore and suddenly wanted to shake her off and turn away.

But Jessica grabbed my wrist and a gleam of light flashed across her face.

""Catherine, what did you have to fight me?""

After saying that, she grabbed my hand and pushed it to her shoulder. Then, she screamed and fell to the ground. I looked at everything in front of me in shock and before I could react, my shoulder was hit hard by someone.

It was David. He rushed over and picked up Jessica, his eyes full of pity. ""Jessica, are you okay?!""

Jessica buried her head in his shoulder sadly and cried aggrievedly, ""I just wanted to explain to Catherine that there was nothing wrong between you and me, but she called me a shameless bitch and said she wanted to kill me.""

Instantly, David yelled at me with red eyes, ""Are you crazy? Jessica was pregnant! Why are you so vicious?""

""I didn’t … ""

""Enough!"" David interrupted my explanation.

""If anything happens to Jessica and her child, I will make you pay!""

After saying that, he ignored my lips that were difficult to open, hugged Jessica and ran out, shouting to the bodyguard, ""Go to the hospital immediately!""

After a long time, I wiped away the tears of disappointment, slowly crawled upstairs and walked towards the bedroom. I began to pack my luggage silently, just waiting for the divorce agreement to take effect. Until the phone rang.

It was David who called me, ""Come to Yates Hospital immediately.""

I hurried to the hospital and saw David standing in the corridor from a distance and Jessica leaned on his arms, crying. My head suddenly shook and I felt dizzy. Now, they didn’t even pretend.

I walked over and moved my eyes away from David’s big hand holding Jessica’s shoulders with difficulty.

""David, what’s wrong?""

""Gregory suddenly suffered from renal failure and needed a kidney donation immediately.""

I was stunned for a moment.

""So?""

""There was no suitable kidney source now,"" David said lightly. ""I did a matching test and the result was a match.""

My heart was suddenly tightened by someone and I looked at him in disbelief.

""You wanted to donate a kidney to him?! But this would have a lifelong impact on your body …""

""I called you here just to inform you that the operation required family members to sign.""

I looked at him straight. Yes, now his wife was still me. But in his heart, his family members had always been the people he was holding in his arms now.

I bit my lips tightly to prevent others from seeing my red eyes.

""I’ll sign.""

When I wrote my name, every stroke seemed to make my heart bleed.

David changed into a surgical gown and lay on the operating cart. I watched him being wheeled away from a distance and finally couldn’t help shouting to him, ""David, the operation went well!""

He raised his head, his eyes moved slightly, but he just nodded.

When he disappeared in the operating room, my tears finally fell. Although I didn’t want to admit it, David’s love for Jessica was so deep that he could risk his future half of his life. I walked out of the hospital in a daze and took a taxi back home.

David didn’t come back that night and he didn’t come back for many days. But every day I could see David’s recent situation from Jessica’s circle of friends.

The operation was successful, but he ignored his wounds and was busy arranging the best ward for Jessica’s adopted son and even transferred top medical teams from all over the world, just for Gregory to recover soon.

For so many years, he had never been so considerate and thorough to his daughter. Even when his daughter had chickenpox and kept asking for her dad, he still hung up the phone and worked overtime in the brightly lit office. In the end, he just asked his assistant to send a toy to his daughter.

Jessica’s latest circle of friends was a photo posted in the morning. \[I would never meet a man who loved us mother and son so much again.\]

David leaned against the head of the bed, kissing her belly devoutly while receiving an IV and his handsome face showed a cherishing look that I had never seen before. My heart ached fiercely and tears fell on the screen of the mobile phone, blurring David’s gentle profile.

Chapter 5

""Mum, was Dad on a business trip again?""

Suddenly, my daughter's voice at the door called me back to my senses.

I woke up at once. Told myself it didn’t matter. Although he didn’t love us, I would love my daughter and myself twice as much.

I opened my arms and hugged her as I answered, ""Yes, baby, he was very busy at work.""

A trace of sadness flashed across my daughter's eyes and she suddenly raised her little face and asked me, ""Mum, were you leaving Dad?""

I was stunned. In fact, I had been so afraid that Charlotte would be hurt that I hadn’t figured out how to tell her about this yet.

I asked in a panic, ""How did you know, baby?""

""That day, I heard you talking to a lawyer on the phone.""

My daughter lay on my legs tightly, as if she were afraid of being abandoned by me, ""Mom, I love you and I always want to stay with you forever.""

Tears fell and I kept kissing her cute little face, ""Of course, Mom would always love you.""

After dinner, I packed Charlotte's luggage and coaxed my daughter to sleep. Suddenly, familiar footsteps came from downstairs, which seemed particularly hurried. Soon, David's face appeared at the door. He rushed in with a chill all over his body and grabbed my arm.

""Hurry up and let Jessica go! Just because I let her move in and I donated bone marrow to her adopted son, you kidnapped her?!""

David gritted his teeth, as if he wanted to bite me to pieces.

My arm seemed to be broken and I was in so much pain that I could not see anything, ""I did not kidnap her!""

Ignoring my excuses and pleas, David dragged me to an amusement park and tied me to the bungee jumping machine that I was most afraid of. Soon, I was in the air and the air under my feet made my eyes black and my heart almost stop beating.

He stood below, staring at me with a more ferocious look than a beast, ""Tell me now and I will let you down, Catherine.""

""David, I really didn’t know where Jessica went! Please, don’t do this to me!""

But he didn’t believe me. On the contrary, he looked cold,

""This was your last chance, Catherine.""

David had known that I was afraid of heights and that I didn’t dare to sit by the window even though it was just an office on the fifth floor. Now, he was going to use the method that I was most afraid of, regardless of my fear, just for his first love and their child.

I was weak all over as I told him, ""I swear, I really didn’t know anything! I was scared, David!""

The next second, he turned around and made a gesture to the staff. Then, I felt a feeling of falling that was more terrible than hell. The moment I fell from the sky at high speed, the overwhelming darkness came and the appearance of this man finally became completely blurred and distorted.

Even if he didn’t love me, but I had never thought that he would treat me so coldly and cruelly.

Ten years of love was ultimately misplaced.

Chapter 6

The smell of disinfectant pierced my nose and before my consciousness was completely restored, a man's low sigh came into my ears.

""You had been in a coma for two days.""

It was David. He sat on a chair beside the bed, working on his mobile phone. Sensing my movement, a soft thing passed through his deep eyes.

David put down his mobile phone, picked up the steaming soup on the bedside table, scooped a spoonful and handed it to my lips. But I subconsciously closed my lips and even slightly turned my head away.

The softness instantly shattered, replaced by a diffuse coldness.

He tightened his fingers around the spoon handle and his voice sank, ""Were you still making trouble? Catherine, I had taught you this lesson because you’d gone too far! You even taught my daughter to slander Jessica. I had been tolerant enough of you, don’t be ungrateful.""

I stared at this face that had been filled with all my youth and love and the corners of my mouth pulled out an arc that I didn’t know whether it was mockery or self-mockery, ""Yes, it was me who was vicious and jealous and I was deliberately trying to harm her! Are you satisfied with this answer?""

My eyes were uncontrollably sour, but I held back and didn’t let a single tear fall.

David looked at my red eyes and felt an inexplicable stab in his heart. He remembered that many years ago, when I had a high fever and curled up in his arms, I also looked at him with red eyes like this. At that time, the look in my eyes had been an inseparable dependence and admiration.

But at this moment, there was only desolation left.

A trace of guilt flashed through his eyes, but it was soon swallowed by the evil fire of disobedience.

""Catherine!"" he raised his voice, eager to prove his correctness.

""Did you know that Jessica had nightmares every night after I rescued her? It was obviously you who caused her … why were you pretending to be a victim here?!""

It was useless to defend myself and it only added to the humiliation. I turned my head silently and looked at the sky outside the window. My disregard angered him and he was about to explode when his cell phone rang.

David quickly turned sideways, but I still saw the screen. Jessica was wearing almost transparent lace underwear, lying seductively on the big bed in the hotel. I didn’t know what was said on the other end, but David’s breathing became rapid.

And the corners of his mouth even raised an arc uncontrollably. He stood up suddenly and said, ""I would pick you up when you were discharged from the hospital. When the time came, apologize to Jessica. She was soft-hearted. As long as you were sincere, she would forgive you.""

Before he finished speaking, his tall figure had disappeared at the door of the ward.

The next day I was discharged from the hospital, but only the driver came to pick me up.

David called, ""Today was Gregory’s birthday. He had suffered in an orphanage since he was a child. I was going to go to the amusement park with Jessica.""

He seemed to remember something and added in a gentle tone of pitiness, ""Don’t worry, I would bring gifts back for you and my daughter.""

The time on the phone reminded me that today was also Charlotte’s birthday.

At the same time, it was the date when the divorce certificate between him and me took effect. Of course, he hadn’t remembered it. I hung up the phone silently, sent the driver away and went to get the divorce decree alone.

My fingertips stroked the two cold jet-black words of ‘divorce’, but my heart was calm without a ripple, as if it were just an insignificant document. When I returned to the villa, I found that David and his friends had not left the house yet.

""Where did you go? The driver said you didn’t let him pick you up.""

He stood in the middle of the living room, looking at me in a straight suit.

Jessica, wearing an exquisite dress, held the equally well-dressed Gregory, leaning against him like a little bird.

I opened my mouth, but before I could say anything, he suddenly raised his eyebrows and said, ""Today was our wedding anniversary. Did you go out to prepare a gift?""

Chapter 7

I was slightly startled and then suddenly realized. Today was indeed also our wedding anniversary. Every year in the past, this day had been the day I spent all my effort to prepare a gift for David even if he never took it to heart.

This year, why had he suddenly ‘remembered’ it?

Did David remember that today was the day when the ten-year contract came to an end and we legally terminated our relationship?

My thoughts were surging and in the end, I just clenched the judgment on my chest and nodded lightly, ""Yes, I went to the mall.""

A trace of satisfaction flashed across his eyes and the corners of his lips curled slightly, ""Well, then I’d take Jessica and Gregory out first. When I came back in the evening, I’d accompany you ... to celebrate.""

""Well.""

My voice was cold.

The butler reminded David carefully, ""The amusement park had been booked as you ordered. Miss Charlotte had been talking about wanting to play the carousel. Did you want to … ""

David hesitated for a moment, then looked at me, ""Then you go and call Charlotte … ""

Before he finished speaking, Jessica trembled suddenly, grabbed his arm tightly, tears in her eyes and trembled in fear, ""David, I was afraid … what if Catherine did something more terrible to me and Gregory in the amusement park?""

David's body stiffened and he hugged her tightly, ""Okay, don’t take them. Let’s go.""

He didn’t look at me again, hugged her with one hand and held her son with the other hand and walked toward the garage.

My heart was calm and I turned and went upstairs. My daughter was standing on the terrace on the second floor, looking at the black Rolls-Royce carrying her father and other children out of the door.

I felt a sharp pain in my heart and I squatted down in front of her to explain to her, ""Dad had something urgent to do, so—""

""It’s okay, Mum!""

But my daughter interrupted me and smiled sweetly at me sensibly, ""I didn’t need Dad, it was enough to have Mum to celebrate my birthday with me!""

My eyes were warm as I said, ""Okay, Mom would make the baby the happiest little birthday star!""

I put on my daughter’s favorite princess dress and took her to my favorite Italian restaurant for a big meal. After lunch, both Charlotte and I went to visit the Museum Victoria and Albert that we both liked.

As night fell, I posted my daughter’s happy little face making a wish on the cake on Instagram.

\[Happy seventh birthday to my little princess!\]

Not long after I posted it, my phone vibrated wildly.

David’s voice was panic and condemnation, ""Why didn’t you remind me that today was my daughter’s birthday?""

Was it necessary?

When my daughter was looking forward to her parents accompanying her to blow out birthday candles and open gifts, her father was spending millions to set off grand fireworks for someone else’s son in the amusement park.

The drones formed a huge confession, shining over the city.

\[Jessica, the girl I love my whole life.\]

Under the bright fireworks, he kissed Jessica passionately.

This scene was captured and broadcast live by countless cameras and instantly swept the hot searches on major platforms around the world.

\#DavidYatesShowsLoveWithMillionsofFireworks

I calmly retracted my gaze from the TV screen and my voice was as cold as ice, ""David, Charlotte was your biological daughter, but did you need me to remind you of her birthday?""

This time, I hung up the phone without waiting for his answer.

""Beep … ""

A mechanical busy tone came from my ears. I didn’t know why, but David’s heart was hit by that inexplicable panic again. I put the divorce decree in the drawer that David often used and wiped off the fingerprints of the password lock for myself and my daughter.

In the living room, those expensive gifts that he had thrown at random. Jewelry, bags, artworks ... I swept them into the trash can expressionlessly. Then, I held my daughter’s hand, dragged the luggage and got into a car waiting on the roadside.

The car started and I took off the ring on my ring finger and threw it out of the car window. Passing an intersection, a black Rolls-Royce passed by us and drove in the opposite direction ...",1,1752822493.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

You know the one — where the ""bad, tea-addicted wife of Prabhupada sold his (!) writings to buy herself some tea. Look what tea does to people! Addicts will do anything for a fix!!!""

But even as a kid, I was... unsettled by one particular thing:
How much does tea actually cost?
Really, how much does a normal packet of tea cost? I saw it in stores, it wasn’t anything fancy. So what kind of condition was their household in that his wife couldn’t afford something that basic? And instead of trying to solve that problem, Prabhupada just kept sitting and writing his translations.

That always raised questions for me, especially because we were taught in lectures that it’s the duty of a gṛhastha (a householder) to provide for their family. But Prabhupada just... took sannyasa? According to Vaiṣṇava rules, shouldn’t he have ensured his wife and children were materially secure before renouncing everything? Just in principle?

And in the end, if we strip away the cultish lens — what do we actually see?
A woman living in poverty, who can’t afford something small that might bring her a little comfort — a little spark of joy from something familiar. And a husband who saw his ""mission"" as more important than that. After all, it’s just a foolish woman — why bother respecting her emotions, right?

The thing is, it could’ve been anything: chips, pizza, a video game. It’s not about the ""evil substances,"" it’s about emotional need. Psychological comfort.
And I’m genuinely relieved to have a space and people around me now who also see how telling this story really is — but not in the way it's usually framed.

The takeaway isn’t ""tea is a dangerous drug.""
It’s that an old man decided to abandon his responsibilities (which even his own books say is wrong) and then, in front of thousands of followers, went on to speak bad about his wife...",5,1752822359.0,exHareKrishna,2,1.0,False

In today’s dynamic work culture, taking a break at the office isn’t just a moment to rest. It’s an opportunity to refresh, collaborate, and reignite creativity. Imagine a break room buzzing with energy, where employees sip on freshly brewed drinks and share ideas that drive innovation. By transforming office breaks into moments of collaboration, companies can boost productivity, strengthen team bonds, and create a workplace that thrives. Here’s how a thoughtfully designed break experience can elevate your office culture and inspire smarter work.

# The Power of a Break Done Right

A break is more than grabbing a quick drink—it’s a ritual that refreshes minds and fosters connection. Picture this: colleagues gathered around a sleek beverage station, the aroma of roasted beans filling the air. This isn’t just about caffeine; it’s about creating a space where ideas flow naturally. Studies show short breaks improve focus and reduce stress, but when paired with high-quality drinks and a welcoming setup, they become opportunities for spontaneous brainstorming and team bonding.

A high-quality [coffee vending service](https://musthavevending.com/coffee-services/) can transform an ordinary break into an inspiring experience. With barista-quality drinks, from creamy lattes to bold espressos, employees feel valued and energized. The right setup think modern machines, a variety of flavors, and easy-to-use equipment makes breaks effortless and enjoyable, encouraging staff to step away from their desks and connect.

# Collaboration in Every Sip

The break room is where hierarchy fades, and conversations spark. A well-crafted beverage experience brings people together, whether it’s a quick catch-up between departments or a casual chat that leads to the next big idea. Unlike formal meetings, these informal moments allow employees to share thoughts freely, fostering a culture of openness and creativity.

Imagine a team member from marketing swapping ideas with someone from tech over a cappuccino, or a manager hearing fresh perspectives from a new hire. These interactions build trust and camaraderie, breaking down silos and strengthening teamwork. A beverage station designed for your office can make these moments happen daily, turning the break room into a hub of collaboration.

# Why Companies Should Invest in This

Adopting a high-quality break experience isn’t just about great drinks it’s about investing in your people. When employees feel valued and supported, they tend to be more engaged and productive. A thoughtfully curated beverage station shows your team you value their well-being, boosting morale and loyalty. Plus, it’s a perk that attracts top talent candidates love workplaces that prioritize culture and comfort.

The setup is simple to integrate. A reliable provider handles everything—delivery, installation, maintenance, and restocking, so your team can focus on work, not logistics. With customizable options, from eco-friendly beans to decaf blends, it fits any office size or preference. It requires minimal effort but creates a significant impact.

# A Smarter Break for a Smarter Workplace

Transforming office breaks with a premium beverage experience is more than a perk—it’s a strategy for success. It fuels energy, sparks collaboration, and creates a workplace where ideas thrive. By investing in a service that brings people together over great drinks, companies can unlock creativity, strengthen teams, and build a culture that drives results. Make every break count—because a smarter break means a smarter workplace.

It was all so strange. She had been rushed to the hospital after her fall. The doctors and nurses had swarmed around her, all while she was in excruciating pain. The baby was coming. That was the only thought she could muster.

The baby was coming.

Why? How?

She had three weeks more. Three more weeks! But Jared had to come around and ruin everything, just like he always did.

Mr and Mrs Fuller must have rushed in when they heard the news, in between being drugged up and the excruciating pain she was feeling she could hear their voices, distant, worried. They kept asking about the baby, not her.

She didn't know what happened, it was all hazy. It was a mercy, that was what Lori knew. It was a mercy that fate had decided to wipe her memory.

Because she wouldn't be able to bear it.

She had woken up the next morning, the lights in her hospital room were bright almost blinding. It took a while adjusting her eyes to the light. When her eyes were finally adjusted she saw that there was not a single soul in her hospital room. Nobody at all.

It wasn't like she was expecting anyone. Mr and Mrs Fuller either, they would be too excited with their new baby. They would have their hands full.

She tried to move her arms, but she was sore all over. So sore.

God it hurts. She thought as she closed her eyes in pain. She didn't know how long she had closed her eyes, willing herself to go back to sleep just to get rid of the pain.

Mercifully, a dark haired nurse walked in moments later.

""You're awake. That's good.""

She said and Lori tried to talk but her throat was so scratchy and dry. She tried to reach out to her nightstand, where there was a bottle of water but the simple movement caused her immense pain.

""Don't worry. I'll get it for you.""

The nurse said as she took the bottle of water.

She poured the water in a small plastic cup next to her nightstand and adjusted Lori's bed so she could sit properly and drink.

Lori took two sips and stopped.

""What happened?""

She asked as she looked around.

""You passed out right after your cesarean section. You had everybody worried and scared. The doctor thought you wouldn't make it.""

The nurse said as she dropped the cup back on the nightstand. She examined her vitals while scribbling on her notepad.

""Do you remember what happened?""

The nurse asked and Lori shook her head.

""I can't seem to remember. I only remember coming here...and the pain...""

She said said and the nurse nodded.

""Yes. You were in a lot of pain.""

The doctor walked in at that moment, he was tall, balding and had glasses on, Lori felt he looked vaguely familiar. She must have seen him when she got to the hospital.

""Good morning Ms Wyatt. How are you doing?""

He asked and Lori shrugged.

""I don't know how to feel, I'm sore all over. I'm in pain.""

She said and the doctor looked at the nurse. They seemed to exchange a look that she knew nothing about.

""Ms Wyatt you were in a very critical condition when you were rushed in last night.""

Lori nodded. Of course she was, she had gone into premature labour.

""We prepped you for an emergency c-section. The surgery was successful. Unfortunately, the baby died, by our reports it was distressed and also had a breathing anomaly.""

Lori was deathly quiet.

The baby didn't make it?!

What?!

""What?""

She said quietly and the doctor sighed.

""We did everything we could, but he didn't have much of a chance in the first place, we suspected that when you went into premature labour.""

The doctor added and Lori whimpered. The sound that came out of her mouth wasn't human. It didn't even sound like it came from her.

""Where is he now?""

She asked and the doctor sighed.

""A Mr and Mrs Fuller came to claim his body. They came with documents showing that you had given away your rights to be his mother.""

They couldn't even wait?!

Or let her see him?

""But! But! I haven't even seen him yet! They didn't let me see him!!!""

She cried out and the doctor and the nurse exchanged silent looks again.

""Ms Wyatt you were out for a long time and legally, they had every right to claim his body.""

Lori started moving in her bed, ignoring the blinding pain.

""Where is he? Where is he now?! I want to see my son!""

She shrieked as she placed one leg on the cold marble floor, the movement alone caused her great pain, but she managed it.

The nurse rushed to her side, her strong arms subduing her and trying to drag her back to the bed.

""You can't move now Ms Wyatt, you're not strong enough yet!""

She came close to Lori and Lori slapped her hand away with all her strength.

The doctor gave the nurse one look.

""Sedate her. She needs to rest.""

He said as he walked out of the room.

Another nurse rushed in at that moment, Lori was still crying, shrieking and batting away the nurse. The other nurse rushed in and pinned her down. Less than a minute, she felt drowsy and everything went blank.

Gabriel Caine paced the corridors of the hospital ward, he was nervous, a little scared and a bit angry. Suzie was crazy. Very crazy. She didn't tell him she was going to labour. She wasn't due for another few days, he thought she was in the clear.

He had specifically told her to call him if she felt the baby was coming because he felt guilty enough leaving her alone when the baby was so close to being born. Unfortunately, she had chose not to listen to him.

He was in New York when Grace's call came in.

He had rushed down from New York back home. He got there as fast as he could, he got there in time, the baby was on the way, but had not arrived yet.

He was worried, his pack was equally worried to be honest.

Even though he and Suzie were a little more than strangers he still cared for her, in his own way.

Gabriel had met Suzie at the annual Alpha's convention that held in Canada. She was part of a different pack, a lesser pack, but she had been making googly eyes at him all through the night of the dinner party. He didn't know her, he didn't know much about her, only that she was a werewolf, albeit a werewolf of lower ranking.

He had planned to be on his best behaviour, so he ignored all her advances, but she caught up with him later at a bar he went to after the party was over and they both drank

a lot and ended up in an hotel room.

He had woken up the next day, naked and already regretting his actions. He left the hotel room before she woke up, dropping off some cash for her on the nightstand so she could get herself home.

He didn't even leave a number for her to call.

Three months later, Gabriel was back from a run when his beta gave him his phone claiming he had a urgent call from a strange woman named Suzie. He had forgotten all about her by then, but only accepted the call out of courtesy.

Suzie claimed she was pregnant and at first he had been outraged, but then he calmed down. He paid for her flight to Denver and made her take a DNA test.

It came out positive, the baby was his. Suzie vehemently protested to keep it, Gabriel agreed, he had no other intentions.

Of course he was mildly disappointed in himself. It was not often that the alpha of one of the most prestigious packs in the world fathered an illegitimate child. Even his own family had been surprised.

Suzie moved in quickly, he had no qualms with that, he only made her know her place. Yes, she was the mother of his child, but she would never be his mate or his Luna, those positions were left unoccupied, till his mate came along.

Suzie tended to ignore that and tried to boss his betas around, still, he tolerated her excesses because she was the mother of his child.

He had left briefly, for a business trip only to get the scary call that she had gone into labour.

The doctor walked out of the theatre, walking briskly while taking off his bloody gloves.

He had a grim look on his face, his heartbeat was racing.

""Mr Caine... I'm sorry.""

Gabriel clenched his jaw, bracing himself for the news.

""We lost the mother. But you have a beautiful baby girl.""

Though he felt guilty of it, a little bit of his tension slipped away after hearing the last part.

""Ms Garcia went into cardiac arrest right after the delivery, we had no idea of her medical history, if we had known, we might have saved her.""

Gabriel nodded, still at a loss for words.

""Can I see my daughter now please?""

He asked and the doctor nodded.

Soon after the nurse came out wheeling the baby out of the theatre and Gabriel approached her to look.

She was crying, screaming bloody murder and Gabriel's heart broke at the sound. At the shrill voice.

His daughter was going to grow up without a mother.

She was going to grow up without Suzie.

Somewhere in his heart, Gabriel felt like he had already failed her.

Chapter 2. Despite being heavily sedated, Lori woke up not well rested. And her whole body hurt. Like hell. She had nightmares too. A baby crying, a wrapped baby in a crib crying and crying. And whenever she tried to reach the baby, it felt like the baby strayed farther

away from her.

The next morning, she didn't feel better, just equally worse. No visitors still. Just a phone call and a text message from her co worker Birdie, who was asking her when she would get back to work.

She had not given her proper notice to why she had missed work. She would text her boss later to inform him.

Ugh. She felt sick inside. Truly sick.

Worse still, she had a new problem, her boobs. They were huge and rock hard. She touched them and winced.

The pain she was feeling was unimaginable.

The nurse walked in with her breakfast tray, weird, She couldn't remember eating the night before, had she gone to bed hungry?

How long was she sedated?!

""Good morning Lori. How do you feel?""

Lori shrugged.

""I feel even worse. My boobs ache so bad.""

She said as she reached for her tray. She was very hungry.

There was chocolate pudding, green beans and scrambled eggs.

""Oh it happens! Sorry about that but they're going to be very sore for a few days.""

""What? Why?""

She asked and the nurse sighed.

""Well, your body has already prepared itself for a baby, so you're lactating.""

""But I don't have a baby. I lost mine.""

Lori said bitterly as she stabbed her plastic fork on the green beans, attacking it with ferocity.

""Yes. I know you did. And it's a horrible thing really.""

Her voice was sympathetic but Lori was sure the woman would never be able to understand the magnitude of pain she was going through.

""I can offer you a better solution to your aching boobs if you want.""

The nurse said as she looked at her hopefully.

""What is that?""

""There is a baby on this floor, she was born the exact same time your baby was born, sadly, her mother didn't make it. She cried all through the night. We fed her formula but, she's not taking it very well. If you donate your milk it could help her.""

Lori sat there for a while, she remembered the cries in her dream. Had she dreamt about a baby crying or was there a baby truly crying?

""Yes.""

Lori said without hesitation and the nurse widened her eyes.

""Yes? Are you sure?""

Lori nodded.

""I am sure.""

She said and the nurse smiled.

""Thank you. I know how hard this is for you.""

She said and Lori scoffed as she looked away. Oh she had no idea.

""I will come back with pumps then have a quick talk with the girl's family to inform them.""

The nurse left and Lori had her breakfast quietly.

Twenty minutes later the nurse came back with pumps like she had said and talked about how the child's father had quickly agreed.

The nurse left with her milk, murmuring something about the milk being screened first.

Lori went back to sleep, the doctor came back to do a checkup on her. Her

c- section scar was healing quite nicely he had told her.

Lori had murmured something about the hospital bill and her doctor had told her the Fullers had cleared the hospital bill.

Good. Because there was no way she would have paid for it herself, she didn't have a dime to her name.

Besides it was in the agreement that they would settle all hospital bills. She only wished they had let her see him before taking him away.

Gabriel didn't leave the hospital, even though he didn't sleep a wink, he didn't leave, he couldn't just bear the thought of leaving his daughter alone.

He had not picked out a name yet, partially because he and Suzie had not come up with one. He wanted her name to be perfect, whatever it is he came up with had to be perfect.

After the baby was born and the doctor told him Suzie didn't make it, he had quietly made her funeral arrangements. Suzie didn't have any family, at least none that he knew of.

Her only family was her daughter.

He remembered when he first held her in his arms, she had immediately stopped crying as he stroked her head gently.

She was so tiny. So so tiny, but when she looked at him, when she really looked at him, the world stopped.

Nothing else mattered at that point, Gabriel knew at that moment he would fight tooth and nail to protect her.

By all tests and count, baby Caine was a healthy child.

She was fine, totally fine, the doctor reassured him many times while begging him to go home and get some rest.

But why was she still crying! He heard enough of her crying to now recognise the sound of her voice. The nurse said she was hungry. Just hungry, she was taking the formula, but it didn't seem to be enough for her. She was ravenous.

Gabriel knew the reason. She wasn't only a baby, she was a pup, a werewolf pup, she would be insatiable. Pups were usually like that while growing up. Unfortunately, Suzie's milk that would have sustained her was now gone.

Gone.

He would be there for her. always.

""Good news Mr Caine.""

A nurse walked in the private waiting room where he stayed when his daughter took her naps in the nursery.

The nurse had come in earlier to tell him they found a donor for her. A woman who was willing to donate her breast milk.

The nurse assured him that after they had screened the breastmilk they would let his daughter have it.

He was relieved, greatly relieved about that. It wouldn't be the same like her mother's but it would be something...

He was so deep in thoughts that he didn't notice his beta and his housekeeper walk in.

""Oh Gabriel! I heard the news! I am so sorry!""

Mrs Grace said as she ran towards him and hugged him.

Gabriel sighed, settling into her hug for a few seconds before pulling away.

""I am sorry Gabriel. Deeply sorry. Suzie didn't deserve this. She wanted to be a mother.""

Draco said.

Gabriel nodded.

""Thank you. Her presence would be missed. Her daughter is already missing her...""

He said and Mrs Grace sat next to him.""

""And how is your little girl?""

""She's good. She's very healthy.""

Mrs Grace seemed to sigh.

""Oh thank the goddess. By the way, you look so tired, we've been waiting for you to come back to the house. Why don't you go home and take a shower and get some rest.""

She asked and Gabriel shrugged.

""I don't want to leave her alone here. Besides, it's only a few more hours and we'll leave. We just want to settle a few things, especially with Suzie's body.""

Suzie had no family that he knew. If she had family, she never mentioned them.

He had no choice but to take charge of her funeral, and bury her in his family crypt. She deserved that honor.

""I know. But you need some rest. And the full moon is in a few hours. Grace can stay and watch the baby.""

Gabriel sighed

How could he forget? It was a full moon, all the heightened emotions and stress he was going through was going to make the full moon a lot more worse.

Draco was right.

He nodded.

""Fine. I'll leave you in charge Grace. I'll go talk to the doctor.""

He said as he stood up and walked out of the waiting room.

**Two days later.**

.

She was cleared. She could leave, even though she was still sore.

She had met a woman named Grace Miler, she seemed to be the caretaker of the little girl who lost her mother.

They would come over to her place to pick up the milk every three days. The woman was also kind enough to give her pumps, bags to store milk, breast covers and all kinds of things that would make it easier for her to pump.

The arrangement was pretty flexible too, Lori could break it off at any time without any explanation. She liked that.

Then the woman had asked her if she would like to see the little girl and Lori had flat out refused.

It would be too much. It was already was too much, giving so much. She only did it because she knew that the baby genuinely needed her help. And she wanted to help, but no, she would not get attached.

She tried to call the Fullers, they wouldn't pick her call. All she wanted from them was a damn explanation! And a location.

Her baby's grave. She wanted to see her baby's grave.

But no, they wouldn't even give her that right.

She left the hospital different from how she came in, the only difference this time was that she was alone. And she was going back to her shitty life and her shitty job.

She felt empty. She was empty. Her tummy had gone down drastically, the bump she had five days ago was nowhere to be found, just like the baby that was once in her womb.

And she looked drained. She remembered standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom on the day she was to be discharged and feeling hollow. She was pale, paler than her Mediterranean skin had ever looked and her lips were pale.

As she applied make up to conceal her ghostly appearance, she quickly realised that nothing was strong enough to hide the heavy bags under her sunken eyes.

It was of no use! There was nothing she could do that would work! Anyone who took one look at her would be able to see that she was hiding something.

How would she ever recover from this?

Chapter 3. It was cruel sometimes. Most times, how life never stopped. It didn't stop for Lori's pain. She couldn't even take the time out to mourn properly, or she would lose her job. So barely two days at home, Lori was back at the diner working her shift as usual.

Almost as if nothing had happened.

Almost as if she didn't just lose a baby last week.

It had been two weeks and no, the pain didn't stop she just found a way to live with it.

It was common knowledge to all her coworkers that she was giving the baby up for adoption. Very common knowledge, so when Birdie had found her crying mid shift in the bathroom, her question had been,

'But you never wanted the baby in the first place. I don't understand why you're sad now.""

Her words were guttural, like a knife severing her insides. She had instantly wiped her tears and went back to work, she had not spoken to Birdie again after that.

The only part of her day that seemed to give her a brief moment of joy was when Mrs Grace came to pick up the milk for the baby.

Lori managed to pump in the mornings and after work, then she would bag, date and freeze the milk.

They had agreed on every three days, but for some reason Lori couldn't stop producing more milk so Mrs Grace sometimes had to come the next day, she wondered if she was making it worse by donating the milk.

Mrs Grace was very kind. Sometimes when she came over to pick up the milk she'd bring Lori food to eat. Home cooked meals. Once she brought her lasagna and the other day it was a key lime pie.

She also never seemed to tire about giving Lori progress about the baby despite the fact that Lori feigned disinterest whenever she talked about the baby.

They had finally gotten around to naming her. Her name was Emilia. Emilia Caine. They sometimes called her Emmy for short.

Jared had also not come around, perhaps he was still feeling guilty about everything. After all, if he hadn't pushed her she wouldn't have gone into premature labour.

A part of her was glad that he had stayed away, although, knowing him he would never stay away for too long. She prayed and hoped that he was away for good now.

She needed stability in her life. Stability and normalcy.

Jared was a chapter she desperately needed to close. She had been trying to close that chapter for months.

""Lori! Table three needs a refill!""

Birdie called out and Lori nodded her head as she walked over to the table with a jug of coffee in her hand.

""Hey! I've seen you here before. Didn't you use to be pregnant?""

He asked and Lori nodded.

""Yes. I was.""

The man's eyes raked all over her in a look she knew all too well.

""Wow. You look great! I mean for someone who just had a baby you look smoking hot!""

He commented and Lori forced a smile. Unsolicited comments and

terrible compliments, it was just the kind of stuff she usually dealt with at the diner.

""Thanks.""

She murmured as she left his table.

Hot?

She didn't feel hot. Nothing about her felt hot.

She was hurt. Hurt and broken. And she feared that she might never recover from the pain that she was feeling, the brutal gnawing in her chest.

She was still deep in her feeling and didn't notice when a man walked into the diner.

She was focused on wiping a table that had a kid had made a mess on.

""Ms Wyatt? Are you Ms Wyatt?""

A deep voice asked.

Lori didn't even turn.

""Yes.""

She answered. After she was done, she turned and found a tall man right in front of her.

She took a small step back.

He was tall. Something about his presence was towering.

Domineering.

Very tall.

Probably six foot two, he was wearing a charcoal black suit, tailored and cut to suit every inch of his body. He had short dark hair, his face was clean shaven except for the tiny mustache he kept, he had deeply unsettling blue eyes that looked too blue to be natural, a jaw that could cut through ice and cheekbones so beautiful they made his face look like he was molded by some perfect god.

She swallowed hard and looked away, catching herself staring, he had that effect on people and he was probably happy that he did.

""Can we sit and talk somewhere?""

He asked and Lori glanced at Birdie who was watching her like a hawk.

""Right now? I'm on my shift.""

""Who are you?""

She asked.

""I'm Gabriel Caine. The father of the little baby you have been donating your milk to these past two weeks.""

""Oh. I'm not due to meet Grace till later today.""

Lori mused and the man nodded.

""I know.. I just wanted to talk to you.""

Birdie was already approaching them now.

Lori glanced at her and scowled.

""Okay. I finish in ten minutes, can it be after my shift? I'm already on probation and I don't want to annoy my boss any further.""

She said and he nodded.

""Okay. I will wait for you in that black car outside.""

He said as he pointed to the sleek black car that was outside. Without one more word, he walked out of the diner.

After her shift, Lori went into the locker room and changed.

Good thing she had at least worn something decent. Her faded red dress and old doc martens boots were at least still presentable.

As she walked out of the diner, Mr Gabriel Caine was already out of his car and moving to the other side to open the door for her.

A gentleman?

Wow surprising. Lori couldn't think of the time a man opened the door for her.

As she stepped into the luxury car, she could immediately smell his cologne, she had caught a whiff of it in the diner, but here it was all she could smell in the car. Incredibly sexy, musky and confident. She smoothed her hand over the leather of the car seat, it was probably worth more than she had ever seen in her entire life.

Damn, it must cost a lot.

She had suspected that baby Emilia's family was comfortable, she just didn't know they were so rich.

""First of all, I want to thank you for your help. Your kindness, towards my daughter even in your own pain is admirable.""

""I don't know how to ever repay you.""

Lori shook her head.

""I don't need payment Mr Caine.""

Grace had certainly offered, the first day she had come to pick up the milk and she jsd seen her apartment complex. She had offered.

""I know. And under normal circumstances I wouldn't offer you but I have a proposal for you Ms Wyatt.""

""A proposal?""

Lori repeated.

What could a rich well to do man like Mr Gabriel Caine possibly have to do with someone like her?

""As you already know, Grace is the sole caretaker of my daughter. She has been taking care of her since she was born.""

""Emilia lost her mother at birth.""

Lori nodded.

""But Grace is old and she tires easily. We decided on getting a nanny and Grace mentioned that you're the only person she would recommend.""

""A nanny?!""

Lori exclaimed and Gabriel nodded.

""I will respect your decision to decline Ms Wyatt but I would also be equally relieved if you decide to take on the job. I intend to reward you handsomely for your services.""

He said as he passed her a contract.

Lori took it with shaky hands.

Was this really happening?

She skimmed through the pages. The sum of ten thousand dollars per month in addition to added benefits hit her.

Whattt?

Ten thousand dollars?!

The requirements were pretty simple, she was to be a live in nanny,

responsible for taking care of Emilia and provide her with

love and care.

""What do you think?""

The man asked and Lori opened her mouth but no words came out.

Slowly, she cleared her throat and looked at him, he was staring at her intently, watching her every move, her every emotion like a hawk.

""I need time to read through the contract

and think about your offer.""

She said as she gulped hard.

He nodded.

""Fair enough. But you have until tomorrow evening. Here's my card.""

He handed her a crisp business card.

""Once you make your choice, call me. A car would come to pick up you and your luggage.""

After she got out of his car, she watched him drive away while she clutched the document in mild shock.

Amber Chase arrived at the hilltop mansion breathless, realizing the party had already begun without her.

The doorman looked surprised to see her. ""Miss Chase, what are you doing here? Everyone's already finished dinner...""

Her husband's birthday celebration, yet they'd forgotten to include his wife. Among all the guests from their social circle, not a single person had bothered to notify her.

She smiled at the doorman and was about to push open the door when she overheard a conversation from inside:

""Victoria, what gift did you bring? Blake has been eyeing your gift bag for half the evening.""

""Have I?""

""You haven't even opened it yet, but you've been eyeing that bag so hard you're practically drilling holes in it! Since Victoria's finally back from overseas, you should just dump Amber already. She totally kills the vibe.""

""For real! She drugged you and jumped into your bed. If you hadn't gone all soft and worried about her reputation by making her your wife, she'd be toast by now. Everyone would've ripped her to shreds.""

The man sitting in the center wore a crisp dark suit with the top two buttons of his shirt undone. His features were striking and aggressive, with naturally deep-set eyes, a high nose, and thin lips. Like a brilliantly poisonous butterfly, his slightly upturned eyes carried a distant, aloof arrogance.

""No rush,"" he said coolly.

""Blake, it's been three years and you're still not in a hurry? Back then, she caused Victoria's sister to become a vegetative patient. If your grandmother hadn't protected her, we would have destroyed her long ago.""

Blake Westwood's elegant fingers played with a lighter in his hand as he caught a glimpse of a shadow at the doorway.

Only then did the group notice that Amber had been standing there for who knows how long.

Someone whispered, ""Who invited her?""

No one answered. Clearly, she had come uninvited.

Amber lowered her lashes. She had a delicate, cool beauty with an oval face and wore a light cashmere sweater. Her forehead was framed by hair gently tucked behind her ears. Just looking at that innocent face, nobody would believe she could pull off such shameless stunts, but she definitely did all that stuff.

She clutched a gift in her hands and looked toward Blake sitting at the center. Her chest felt as if it were bound by wire, the pain penetrating deeply, making her fingers clench tightly.

She walked to his side, but before she could offer her carefully prepared gift, she saw him slightly furrow his brow and casually mock her: ""Who invited you?""

Laughter erupted around them, shattering what remained of her pride.

Victoria, standing nearby, gave Blake a reproachful glance before pulling Amber to sit down. ""She's still your wife. It's only right for her to bring you a gift. Amber, sit down. Blake just has a terrible temperament.""

Amber pressed her lips together without speaking. She was his wife, yet needed his ex-fiancée to smooth things over. No one here welcomed her, but she had come anyway, just because when he was eighteen, he had promised they would celebrate his twenty-eighth birthday together.

She deliberately sat next to Blake, displacing Victoria.

Victoria's expression faltered momentarily before becoming somewhat unpleasant. Then she asked, ""What gift did you bring for Blake?""

A mischievous guest immediately opened it, revealing a scarf without tags that appeared handmade.

Victoria's voice rose again, ""Oh my! We must be connected somehow—I also brought Blake a scarf.""

The two scarves now sat side by side, both handmade, with no discernible difference in craftsmanship.

Someone accidentally bumped the table, causing an open bottle of wine to spill toward both scarves.

Blake reached out and took one of them, while the other became soaked with wine and reeked of alcohol.

He had taken Victoria's scarf.

Seeing the scarf she had knitted for two months soaking in wine, Amber's face turned pale for reasons she couldn't explain, her heart feeling both numb and dull.

Victoria sighed, sympathetically linking arms with her. ""Amber, don't be upset. This one can still be used after washing.""

Amber still didn't respond, instead looking toward Blake.

He kept his lashes lowered, hiding the emotions in his eyes.

The atmosphere got super awkward, with Amber basically crashing what was supposed to be a fun celebration. Everyone started making excuses to leave.

She just sat there motionless, staring at the scarf abandoned on the coffee table, discarded just like her.

As others gradually left, she fixed her gaze on Blake, who was also about to stand. ""Blake, happy birthday,"" she said softly.

Blake acted as if he hadn't heard. When he was twenty-one, he had just been reunited with the Westwood family. By then, he was already a self-made business prodigy with nineteen-year-old Amber by his side.

Seven years later, the business prodigy had become a titan at the center of power, but any feelings between them had long since vanished.

Those difficult early days of struggling together in obscurity now seemed like another lifetime.

Blake had Victoria escorted home.

Victoria reached out and lightly touched his shoulder. ""Talk things through with her. Don't keep fighting.""

Someone scoffed quietly, ""Victoria, you're too kind-hearted.""

""I'm not kind-hearted. I just think the young Amber didn't know any better back then. I'm sure she didn't mean it.""





""Bullshit. She ruined someone's life and shamelessly stole your place. How dare she show her face again.""





Their voices were filled with disgust, growing fainter as they left.





Amber sat motionless, as if paralyzed, every drop of blood running cold, her lips losing their color.





She stood up, grabbed the soaked scarf, and looked at Blake.





""Blake.""





Her voice was gentle as she called his name.





Blake had already draped his suit jacket over his arm. Hearing her, he loosened his tie slightly without looking at her, his brow visibly irritated. ""What now?""





She smiled faintly, her beautiful lips forming the words: ""Let's get divorced, Blake.""





Surprise flashed in his eyes, quickly replaced by layered malice in his expression. ""What new game is this? First you drug me to get me to sleep with you, and now you're acting noble and asking for divorce? Aren't you tired of these tactics, Amber?""





""I'm sorry for wasting three years of your life, but I'm serious this time.""





Blake's mocking expression disappeared inch by inch as he yanked her close, his fingers digging into her chin. Seeing her wince in pain somehow eased his unexplainable frustration. ""Now you're talking about wasting time? Where the hell were you three years ago? Listen up, Amber—you want a divorce? Fine! But you won't see a single fucking penny from me!""





""I'll leave with nothing.""





Her eyes were clear, her voice still calm and untainted.





After the Westwoods finally tracked down Blake, they promptly adopted Amber—who'd been by his side—as their goddaughter. Everyone knew exactly what they were doing: the family didn't want their precious second-in-line, the backup heir to the Westwood fortune, marrying some nobody with an ordinary background, so they gave her this goddaughter status to shut people up.





Blake stared at her cool face, his throat working silently as he turned away.





""Fine. Nothing. Don't regret it.""





Chapter 2





Outside, rain had begun to fall without anyone noticing. The mansion was on a hilltop in the suburbs, making it difficult to get a taxi.





The others had already left in their cars. Amber, who had arrived by taxi, was now the last one remaining. She stood under the eaves, watching the drizzle.





A black Rolls-Royce cut through the rain and stopped in front of her. The window lowered, revealing Blake's assistant's face—Devon Ward.





""Mrs. Westwood, please get in.""





Amber remained standing, her gaze penetrating the car window crack, seeming to know someone else sat inside.





She didn't speak, and Blake's voice rose from within.





""Drive. Let her cool off out here.""





Devon looked uncomfortable but had no choice. He drove away.





Amber watched the car leave, blinking as raindrops drifted in and landed on her face, their coolness penetrating to her marrow.





At eighteen, Blake had looked forward to celebrating his twenty-eighth birthday with her, but at twenty-eight, he thoroughly despised her.





During these three years, he hadn't touched her once, had barely even come home.





Society gossips said she was the most pitiful among all the women who had married into powerful families. All she had was a beautiful cage and nothing else.





In everyone's eyes, she was the villain who had caused Victoria's sister Sophia to become a vegetative patient and then stolen Victoria's fiancé. She deserved universal contempt.





But no one seemed to remember that from age twelve to nineteen, she had accompanied him from his lowest point to his rise to prominence.





Everyone said the Westwoods had already done her a huge favor with that goddaughter title, but she still wasn't satisfied—using those seven years together to emotionally blackmail Blake for life.





Another seven years had passed. All told, she had been by Blake's side for fourteen years.





She lowered her lashes, staring at the rideshare request on her phone. Still no drivers willing to accept the trip.





By the time she returned to River Haven, it was already two in the morning. Her skirt was soaked, clinging to her ankles. In the deep autumn night, it was so cold her lips trembled slightly.





Lights were still on inside the mansion. As she changed her shoes in the entryway, she saw the man sitting on the sofa handling business documents.





Blake's bone structure was exceptional. No matter how long one looked at him, his appearance remained stunning and captivating.





Sitting there, he resembled an unattainable snow-capped mountain.





Amber certainly didn't think he was waiting for her. Three years ago, they had completely fallen out, and she had transformed from a once-bright young woman into someone who barely recognized the shrew she saw in the mirror.





She quietly changed her shoes, tossed the scarf into the garbage bin by the door, and went upstairs.





The master bedroom contained many of her things, kept clean and cozy, since Blake had rarely returned home in the past three years. Everyone mocked her for living as a married single woman.





She pulled out a small suitcase and packed some of her regularly worn clothes. As for the wall of luxury bags and jewelry, she had never touched them.





Blake had said she wasn't worthy.





In his eyes, she was a gold-digger. Placing luxury items in front of her but forbidding her to use them was his form of torture.





Amber came downstairs with her suitcase and placed the signed divorce agreement on the coffee table.





""Blake, I've signed it.""





During these three years, they fought whenever they met—more accurately, she would unilaterally accuse him of coldness, desperately trying to get his attention like a madwoman. He would stand silently, watching her lose control with a detached, cold indifference.





Blake's gaze shifted from his computer to her suitcase, his throat burning as if someone had poured sulfuric acid down it, scorching from his throat to his stomach.





He sneered, his cold, mocking voice like a sharp knife threatening to pierce her eardrums. ""Bringing this tiny bit of stuff—what, you planning to keep coming back for more every few weeks? Amber, did you forget how you landed this position in the first place? I was engaged to Victoria, and you drugged me at our engagement party, got us caught in bed together, and forced me to marry you.""





""Yeah, that's on me.""





She gripped the handle of her suitcase, her face draining of color, her damp skirt making her appear on the verge of collapse.





Her fingers clenched tightly. After a long silence, she finally spoke hoarsely.





""Blake, I want to know—why did you suddenly stop loving me?""





She had pondered this question many times over the past three years. Back when they huddled together in that cramped apartment, he had said Blake would love Amber forever. Later, after the Westwood family found him, people had warned her to take some money and leave, saying the Westwoods would never accept a daughter-in-law of her background.





She hadn't listened, clinging to his promise, waiting for him to come marry her in grand style.





Instead, she received news of his engagement to Victoria. He said he no longer loved her.





How could he stop loving her so suddenly?





""Because you're not worthy.""





Those words hit her like a hammer blow, making her dizzy.





She couldn't describe the pain. Her heart felt punctured in countless places, bleeding profusely.





When he loved her, he said Amber was the best girl in the world. When he stopped loving her, he casually said she wasn't worthy.

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard in the trading world. It’s enough to get a feel for the platform without risking your entire paycheck.

1m2vh8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m2vh8m/help_me_find_this_story_i_wont_give_my_heart_to/,Help me find this story “I won’t give My heart to You”,"Chapter 1 Right after Elie Roberts submitted her resignation, her mom called. ""Elie, how's the resignation going?"" ""I've already turned it in. I'll officially be out in a month."" ""That's great,"" her mom said, sounding more cheerful. ""The friends in town and I picked out a few decent boys for you. Meet them when you're back, okay? Let's try to get you engaged this year."" Then she sighed. ""And stop thinking about that heir from the Lawrence family. He's from a whole different world. We're not the same."" Elie's throat tightened, eyes started to tear up. ""It's okay, Mom. I get it. I'll be back after I finish the handover."" After hanging up, Elie started packing up her desk. Years at the Lawrence Group had left her with way too much to sort through. She was only halfway done when her phone vibrated again. It was a message from Clara Grayson: a location pin, followed by two words, ""Come over."" The address was none other than Eric Lawrence's villa. Twenty minutes later, Elie was standing at his front door. The front door was ajar, so she pushed it open and walked in. Clara was standing in the middle of the living room, holding a bracelet. Elie's heart sank. She was sure she'd cleared everything out when she moved out of this place. How did something get left behind? Before she could react, Clara slapped her across the face. ""I've been trying to figure out who was with Eric while I was abroad, and I never would've guessed—it was you, my best friend! ""Elie, with that plain face and flat figure? You really think you could seduce Eric?"" Elie trembled, shame crashing over her like a wave. ""Clara, it was a mistake between him and me. And we're just friends with benefits... It only happened after you two broke up. I never crossed the line before that."" Smack! Clara slapped her again. ""Breakup or not, Eric will always be mine. Who do you think you are?"" This one hit harder—Elie felt blood at the corner of her mouth. When Clara raised her hand for a third slap, Elie finally caught her wrist. ""Elie, what do you think you're doing?!"" The icy voice came from behind just before she was yanked away with force. She stumbled and fell to the marble floor, her knee slamming against it with a sharp pain that made her gasp. Eric stood in front of Clara, shielding her. His black suit made him look even taller and more imposing, but the coldness in his eyes made her shiver. Clara's tears fell right away. ""Eric, I found out about you and Elie. My best friend and my ex... I was just upset and asked her a few questions, and she tried to hit me."" ""I didn't! She—"" ""Enough,"" Eric snapped, cutting Elie off. But when he turned to Clara, his expression softened instantly, even a little panicked. ""Clara, what happened with Elie was a mistake. I just missed you so much that I lost control. You came back, and I chose you. Doesn't that prove who I love?"" Elie's heart felt like it was being crushed in someone's fist. So that was it. In his eyes, she wasn't even a replacement—just a way to vent his desire. Clara looked up at him, eyes full of tears. ""Are you sure you don't love her?"" ""I don't,"" Eric said flatly, without a moment of hesitation. ""Okay,"" Clara said, pointing at Elie. ""Then prove it. Tell your bodyguards to strip her."" Elie's whole body went cold. She turned to Eric, but he just stood there in silence, frowning. ""I knew you couldn't let her go!"" Clara shouted. ""Fine then, I'm leaving. I hope you're happy together!"" The words had barely left her mouth when Eric grabbed her arm and gave an order to the guards by the door. ""Do it."" The two guards stepped forward. Elie struggled desperately, but she was no match for their strength. ""No... please, don't..."" The sound of fabric tearing echoed harshly through the villa. In seconds, her shirt buttons popped off, her skirt was ripped, and her bra strap snapped... Just as the last shred of clothing was torn away, Eric finally spoke, ""Enough. ""Get her out of here. I don't want to see you again."" Elie covered her body and stumbled out the door. She heard Eric's gentle voice behind her. ""Clara, don't be mad..."" Rain poured hard, stinging against her exposed skin, but it still wasn't nearly as cold as what she felt inside. She clutched the shredded fabric to her chest, struggling forward in the heavy rain. Rain mixed with tears, running into her mouth, bitter and salty. And then, like a flood, the past came crashing down on her. Back in college, Eric was every girl's dream—tall, handsome, and the star of the basketball court. Every game he played brought out a chorus of screaming fans. Clara was the campus belle—beautiful, fair-skinned, and from a wealthy family. Elie, on the other hand, was practically invisible. Ordinary looks, ordinary life—nothing that stood out. Then one day during lunch, Clara suddenly sat down across from her with a tray and a dazzling smile. ""Eating alone is so boring. Let's eat together from now on."" That was the day Elie became Clara's so-called best friend. People always said Clara was so nice for hanging out with someone like Elie, the ugly duckling. But Elie knew the truth. Clara only kept her around to make herself shine brighter. Then one day, Eric entered their little circle. At first, Elie thought he liked her. That evening, when a few thugs cornered her in an alley, it was Eric who stepped in to help. The way he stood there, backlit by the sunset, became the brightest memory of her youth. But it didn't take long for her to realize that Eric only got close to her to pursue Clara. Because the easiest way was through her best friend. Even so, Elie helped him. She could still remember all the times she praised Eric in front of Clara—how she always found excuses to slip away when they were together, and how her diary was filled with ""Eric,"" written again and again, though no one ever knew. After that, she became like an NPC in their story, watching Eric win Clara over and treat her like a queen. She thought she'd spend the rest of her life watching them go from dating to marriage, and then having kids. But everything changed right before graduation, when Clara suddenly broke up with him and left for overseas without looking back. Eric chased her to the airport and stood in the rain for a full day and night, but all he got was her walking away without a glance. During that time, Elie stayed by his side. When he drank too much, she picked up the empty bottles. When he hit rock bottom, she quietly kept his life in order. Eventually, she even became his secretary, managing both his work and personal life. Then came that night at the business banquet. Eric had been drugged. When she was reaching for her phone to call a doctor, he lost control and pushed her down on the lounge sofa. Afterward, he didn't even look at her. Still, she couldn't forget the heat of his skin, the sound of his heavy breathing. It happened a few more times after that, always after he got drunk. He never kissed her, never looked her in the eye. Just coldly used her. They'd been friends with benefits for three years. But the moment Clara came back a month ago, Eric went right back to her without hesitation. That was when Elie realized it was time to walk away. So she quietly turned in her resignation and agreed to go back home for the blind dates her mom had set up. What she didn't expect was that even after all that, Clara still wouldn't let her go. Elie returned home, drenched from head to toe, when her phone lit up. She checked it and saw a large bank transfer from Eric. The note was just a cold word, ""Compensation."" Then another message popped up. ""I know you like me."" She stared at the screen, her breath catching in her throat. So he had known all along. Every stolen glance, every planned ""coincidence,"" the little acts of ""accidental"" kindness—she thought she'd hidden it so well. ""But we were never possible. ""Clara was just too upset today. ""Don't take it personally. ""And don't you dare get jealous and hurt her."" Each message hit like a knife to the heart. Elie laughed out loud, laughing so hard that tears spilled from her eyes. She thought back to all those years. When he held her while drunk, calling out Clara's name, she held back tears. When she slipped his birthday gift in with a pile of packages, too afraid to even sign her name. When he kissed her in the office, he always covered her eyes. So he'd known all along. Her fingers hovered over the screen for a long time. Then, finally, she replied, ""Don't worry, Mr. Lawrence. I'll never like you again."" Chapter 2 The moment she hit send, she sank into a bathtub filled with water. Bubbles slowly rose to the surface, like the love she had buried all these years, finally sinking for good. The next day, Elie continued to go to work. But she was shocked to find a photo of her, soaked on her way home, had gone viral online. ""Flat as a board and still dares to run naked? I wouldn't even look if she walked past me! She's clearly desperate for fame. She's gone crazy trying to gain views!"" ""Look at how miserable she looks—doesn't seem like she's trying to gain attention, more like a homewrecker who got beaten up! Serves her right. Shameless woman messing with someone else's relationship. Why couldn't she just get hit by a car?"" Reading the cruel, hateful comments, Elie felt awful, but there was nothing she could do. Worried her mom might see the photos, she anxiously kept scrolling and spent the whole morning reporting them. Online discussions only grew more intense until someone tried to dox the woman in the photo. But within minutes, the entire trending topic was wiped, and all photos and videos vanished without a trace. Elie had no idea why, but it brought her a sense of relief. She forced herself to act normal and got back to work. When she brought some documents to Eric for a signature, she walked in on Clara angrily confronting him. ""You're the one who took down the trending topic, aren't you? No one else has that kind of power! Why would you do that? Do you like her?"" Elie froze; she hadn't expected it to be Eric. Eric looked at Clara with a frown, clearly frustrated. ""I did take it down, but it's not what you think. She's my assistant. If her identity were exposed, it could hurt the company's stock. I swear, I don't have any feelings for her. Clara, I only like you. Please, believe me."" Clara was about to say more, but Eric suddenly pulled her into his arms and kissed her, cutting off her words. She struggled at first, but his skilled and gentle kiss slowly made her give in, her breathing growing unsteady. Elie stood outside the door, watching the scene, feeling cold all over. So this was what it looked like when he kissed someone he loved. His long fingers slipped into her hair, gently pulling her into his arms, eyes filled with undeniable possessiveness and affection. In three years, he'd done everything intimate with her—except kiss her. She should've known then. It was because he didn't love her. A sharp pain struck her heart. Just as she turned to leave, a coffee cup suddenly came flying toward her. She stumbled and fell hard to the floor, a gash opening on her forehead from the hit. As she raised her hand to cover the wound, Clara's angry voice rang out. ""How long have you been spying at the door? Do you enjoy watching people kissing?"" Elie lowered her head, her voice hoarse as she tried to explain she was just there to deliver documents. But Clara walked over coldly, lifted her heel, and crushed Elie's hand, grinding down hard on the fingers still clutching the papers. ""Ah!"" The papers were crushed under the pressure, and Elie's hand was scraped, blood seeping through the torn skin. Her body trembled from the pain, but Clara clung to Eric's arm and started to complain. ""Eric, look—she's not just a liar; she's incompetent. She ruined the documents, too. Can't you just fire her?"" Eric's gaze darkened. He stayed silent for a moment before speaking quietly, ""She's handling several important contracts right now. I can't fire her for now."" Clara looked at him suspiciously, her tone laced with dissatisfaction. ""Can't or don't want to?"" Chapter 3 Eric lowered his voice and coaxed her, ""I do have work to handle, and I can't afford delays. If it were just about firing a secretary, why would I lie to you?"" Clara still wouldn't let it go. ""Fine, don't fire her. Then make her stay on her knees at the company entrance for a whole day. Is that okay?"" This time, Eric agreed and looked over at Elie. ""These contracts are tied to a major deal. You either pay eight million, or stay on your knees at the entrance for a day."" Elie knew he was doing this to appease Clara. There was no way she could come up with eight million, so she staggered to her feet and, enduring the humiliation, stayed on her knees at the front door. She hung her head low, hiding the burn in her eyes, while the chatter of passing coworkers reached her ears. ""Isn't she Mr. Lawrence's most trusted secretary? Why's she on her knees out here in front of everyone? So embarrassing."" ""I saw it too. She didn't do anything wrong. She just pissed off Ms. Grayson and got punished for it."" ""Ms. Grayson is Mr. Lawrence's first love. Even after all these years apart, he still isn't over her. Messing with Ms. Grayson? Yeah, she had it coming."" Each word stabbed into Elie like a needle, making it hard to breathe. She suddenly thought back to school. On Clara's birthday, some boys had made fun of her, saying she was the cow dung that highlighted the campus belle. Everyone burst into laughter. She'd bolted, hiding in the stairwell. It was Eric who found her there, handing her a pack of tissues. ""Don't worry about others. Just focus on yourself, that's enough."" Even now, Elie still remembered those words. She always thought Eric saw something special in her, and that's why he kept her close. She gave everything to her work, never complained, and always did her best. But the moment Clara came back, he threw all her years of hard work and loyalty aside, just for Clara. Yeah... In the end, she was just a secretary he could fire at will. Now that she was no longer useful, it was time to leave. Elie stayed on her knees all day. Her skin was torn and bleeding, and the pain made it nearly impossible to walk. When work ended, she limped back to the office to grab her bag and ran into Eric. He glanced at her injuries and frowned slightly. ""Take a few days off. Get some rest. Come back when you're better."" Elie murmured, ""Okay,"" without looking at him, then turned and walked away. Once she got home, she treated her wounds and started packing her things. The moment Clara's return made the news, Eric had told her to move out of the villa. Back then, she'd left in a hurry, just tossed everything into a box, making a mess. Now that she was going back to her hometown, she figured it was time to clean things up properly. She got rid of the jewelry Eric gave her, the photos she'd secretly taken while he was asleep, the diary where she wrote about her crush on him at the university, and all the other little things. Every now and then, gossip from the office group chat would pop up. When Clara came back from shopping with sore legs, Eric got down to his knees and gave her a massage. When she complained the office lights were too bright, he had the entire building's lighting replaced overnight. When she was in a bad mood, he canceled all his meetings just to accompany her. Elie kept scrolling quietly, repeating to herself, ""It'll be over soon. Just hang in there."" Once her injuries healed, it was time for the company's annual party. Eric showed up with Clara, and the whole room burst into applause. Everyone was saying how perfect they were for each other—rich, good-looking, a match made in heaven. He helped Clara down the stage, fixed her dress, took off his jacket to put around her shoulders, and turned down the drinks others tried to toast her with. Elie sat quietly in a corner, watching the way Eric smiled at Clara. She lowered her eyes silently. Then came the award ceremony. Just like every year, Elie won Employee of the Year. With all eyes on her, Elie stepped onto the stage. The screen behind her started playing a slideshow of her accomplishments over the past year. She adjusted the mic, ready to give her speech, but suddenly, there was a commotion in the audience. People were whispering and looking at her with odd expressions. Chapter 4 Elie's eyelid twitched. Something was wrong. She turned around and saw her PPT had been swapped. The screen was now showing humiliating photos from college, ones that had been secretly taken without her knowing. Mixed in were censored bed photos, in which her face was clearly visible. Elie knew right away that those photos came from Eric's villa security footage. Her whole body went cold, and her mind went blank. She glanced instinctively toward Eric. He was frowning, but Clara beside him wore a smug, taunting grin. Elie immediately knew it was her doing. Anger rushed up, and she stepped forward, ready to ask what it would take for Clara to finally leave her alone. Eric's expression darkened as he stepped in front of her, his voice icy cold. ""What are you doing? Not feeling humiliated enough? Remember, you're just a secretary!"" With tears in her eyes, Elie looked at him. ""Mr. Lawrence, yes, I'm just a secretary, but I'm still a person. Don't I deserve respect? She deliberately showed those photos— ""Enough! Stop acting crazy here!"" Eric snapped, his face dark. He called the security guards over and had her kicked out. In front of everyone, they grabbed her by the hair and dragged her out, humiliated her, then shoved her down the high stairs. She tumbled down, bruised all over, blood seeping out and staining the floor red. A sharp, tearing pain shot through her whole body, hitting every nerve. Tears she'd been holding back finally spilled over, clouding her eyes. She curled up, hugging herself tightly, and slowly blacked out. When she opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital. She stared blankly at the ceiling for a long time, then picked up her phone. The office group chat was flooded with talk about the annual party. Someone had even shared videos and photos, mocking her without holding back. ""Elie's not even that pretty, but turns out she's so wild in private? I thought she was frigid with that cold expression, but she's just a shameless flirt. No idea which guy she's messing around with, but taking that many photos? She must be thirsty."" ""Frigid? She's been all over Mr. Lawrence at work, basically throwing herself at him. Lucky for him, he's only into Ms. Grayson and has never fallen for someone that low."" ""A gold-digger using her body to climb the ranks, like she could ever compare to Ms. Grayson. It's a total insult. Honestly, she should just save herself the embarrassment and leave. If she stays, she's just making a fool of herself."" Each word felt like a dull knife slicing into Elie's heart, causing unbearable pain. Her palm was torn up from clenching so hard, and she bit down until her teeth ached. She was finally barely holding it together. She had no idea how much time had passed before the ward door opened. When she looked up, a male coworker from the planning team walked in, holding a cup of water. ""Elie, you're awake! How do you feel? Want me to get the doctor?"" Elie was a little dazed, then shook her head. ""I'm okay. Was it you who brought me here?"" Marcus Schmidt scratched his head awkwardly, giving her a shy smile. ""Yeah, I saw you passed out by the door and got worried, so I brought you to the hospital. Luckily, the doctor said it was just stress."" The word ""passed out"" brought back memories of the company party, and Elie's face froze. Marcus realized he'd said the wrong thing and quickly went quiet. The room stayed silent for a long time before he finally spoke up carefully. ""Elie, don't let those rumors get to you. They're not mad because you did anything wrong, but because they have a prejudice against you. Someone's definitely trying to hurt you by photoshopping those pictures. You can call the police, or if you don't want to deal with that pressure, I can help you. You can just say you're in a normal relationship..."" When she saw his ears turning bright red, Elie recalled how he'd always find random excuses to talk to her, and how he'd bring her coffee or snacks every now and then. Only then did she realize that Marcus probably had a thing for her. But she'd only ever seen him as a colleague, and she'd already made up her mind to leave. So when he hinted at his feelings, Elie forced a small smile and politely turned him down. ""Thanks for your concern, but I can handle this on my own."" Marcus looked a little crushed, but he wasn't backing down. He reached under the bed, pulled out a bunch of roses, and nervously handed them to her. He stammered, ""I-I've liked you for a while now. I just never had the guts to say it. I know the timing's not great, but I wanted to try. Could you give me a chance? Maybe we could try being together—"" Marcus didn't even get to finish his words before the door was kicked open. Startled, they both turned toward the noise—Eric stood there, furious, with a sullen face. He glared at Marcus as he spat out, ""Get out!"" Chapter 5 Intimidated by Eric's overpowering presence, Marcus shot to his feet and rushed out of the ward, bowing as he left. Eric slammed the door behind him, then turned to the flowers beside Elie. ""So, he's into you and told you how he feels?"" Elie met his gaze but stayed quiet. Without waiting for an answer, Eric grabbed the roses and tossed them out the window. Elie had rejected Marcus, but she didn't want his feelings to be treated like trash. She pulled out her IV to pick up the flowers, but Eric caught her wrist and pushed her back onto the bed. He stared her down, eyes cold as ice. ""What are you doing? It's just a crappy bouquet. Don't tell me you like him too?"" Elie pushed him away and said coldly, ""Mr. Lawrence, you're just my boss. Who I'm with is none of your business."" Eric's expression darkened, and he gripped her wrist so hard it left red marks. ""Yeah, but don't forget company policy says no office relationships. If you even think about saying yes to him, he's out of the Lawrence Group tomorrow."" Elie knew he always meant what he said, and she didn't want to drag anyone else into this, so she told the truth. ""I don't like him, and I'm not planning to be with him."" Only then did Eric's expression ease a little. He let go of her hand and finally got to the real reason he came. ""It was indeed Clara who changed the photo at the annual party. But now that she knows the truth, it's understandable she's mad at you. Once things settle down, I'll promote you to head of the secretary department, and your salary will double. Just focus on your work. Clara agreed this was the last time. She won't come after you again, so don't hold it against her anymore."" His offer sounded great, but Elie wasn't moved. She took a deep breath, about to tell him she was resigning. But before she could speak, Clara's call came in. ""Eric, I want to go to the beach for a few days. Will you come with me?"" Eric spoke to her gently, leaving Elie behind without a second thought as he walked out. He left in such a rush that he didn't hear what she said. ""I don't need a promotion because I already turned in my resignation."" As the door closed behind him, Elie looked down. ""Forget it. He'll find out sooner or later,"" she thought to herself. In the days that followed, while Eric stayed with Clara, Elie went back to work like nothing had happened. Marcus was transferred back to his hometown branch the very next day. Elie didn't even get to see him one last time. People at the office still gave her weird looks, but no one brought up the annual party anymore. Things had finally calmed down. Elie went to the HR department to ask if she could leave early. The HR staff looked troubled. ""Ms. Roberts, if you want to resign early, you'll need Mr. Lawrence's special approval."" Elie nodded and got to work on her early resignation request. Right as she was about to find Eric for a signature, he called and sent her an address, telling her to come immediately. When she got to the private room at the club, Elie realized Eric's friends—and Clara—were all there, laughing and playing games. As soon as he saw her, Eric looked up and nodded toward the drinks on the table. ""Clara lost a few rounds, but she's on her period and can't drink. You drink for her. 1.5 thousand dollars per glass."" Elie knew Eric had damaged his stomach from drinking too much in the past. Now he couldn't touch any alcohol at all. Otherwise, he would drink for Clara himself. Elie looked at the dozen or so glasses of whiskey on the table. She said quietly, ""Mr. Lawrence, it's after work hours. I have the right to refuse this assignment. But if you insist I drink for her, I don't want the money; I just want your signature."" Eric frowned slightly. ""Signature? For what?"" Elie handed him the resignation form. He was just about to open it when Clara tugged on his arm, pouting. ""Eric, I lost again. Hurry up and make her drink for me!"" Eric responded gently to her and didn't bother reading the form. He signed it without hesitation and tossed the pen back. ""All done. Now drink."" Chapter 6 Elie slipped the agreement into her bag and downed her drink. She kept going, glass after glass, until her stomach was in knots and she felt like throwing up. After forcing down the last one, she got up, swaying, heading for the bathroom, but Eric's friends blocked her path. ""Eric, Clara lost again! She picked dare, and the card she got said she had to kiss a random single person here for three minutes!"" Hearing this, Eric didn't even hesitate. He just grabbed Clara and kissed her. They were immersed in it, and the whole room erupted with cheers and shouts. Elie sat there, groggy and dazed, watching them kiss like they were in their own little world. A bitter ache spread through her chest. When the kiss finally ended, Eric still looked like he wanted more, while Clara blushed. But Eric's friends started teasing again. ""That kiss doesn't count! The card said she had to kiss a single guy. You're her boyfriend. Totally doesn't count."" Eric's smile faded. ""Clara's mine. You really think I'd let her kiss someone else?"" Everyone could tell he was pissed, so they quickly tried to smooth things over and pulled Elie. ""Of course, we wouldn't touch Clara. But hey, there's always a backup option, right? Ms. Roberts can take the dare instead."" Elie's face went pale in an instant. She instinctively looked at Eric and saw him refuse with a stiff expression. ""She only agreed to drink. Kissing wasn't part of the deal."" The guys exchanged glances, then started laughing. ""Come on, that's nothing a little money won't fix. Ms. Roberts always listens to you, doesn't she? Remember when we were racing, and the rule was that if your companion wouldn't get in the car, you'd lose a yacht? You didn't even say anything, just gave her a look, and she got in. If she was willing to risk her life for you, a kiss should be no big deal."" Clara's eyes welled up with tears as she yanked her hand out of Eric's. ""Didn't you say you didn't have feelings for her? Then why did you take her racing with you? If you like her that much, go make her your girlfriend. I'll find someone else to kiss and finish the dare!"" Then, she stormed off. Eric panicked. He took out a bank card and threw it at Elie before rushing after Clara. ""There's 150,000 dollars on that card. Kiss in Clara's place for three minutes."" Watching him walk away, Elie felt like her heart was broken. She didn't want to agree to this deal. She turned to leave, but Eric's buddies pushed her back down. They brought over a stray dog, forced its jaw open, and pulled out its tongue. Then, they shoved her toward it with sneering voices full of spite. ""Clara told us everything. You're quite wild. Your bed photos are all over the office, aren't they? A slut like you trying to seduce Eric? Disgusting!"" ""No one would want to kiss you. Touch your saliva and we'll probably end up in the hospital. A dog's the only thing you're good for. You know what they say—sluts and dogs are a perfect match."" Elie was so humiliated that tears streamed down her face as a wave of nausea hit her. She threw up uncontrollably, bile mixed with blood splattered across the floor. By the end of it, she was completely drained, her eyes blank and lifeless. As they walked away, laughing out loud, only one thought remained in her mind—she was done with Eric. She would never come back. Chapter 7 Elie submitted her early resignation form to HR and watched them stamp it. ""Since Mr. Lawrence approved it, Ms. Roberts, you should hand over all your work, and you can leave in three days."" After days of feeling down, Elie's mood finally started to lift. She headed back to her desk to finish up her remaining work. After two days of sorting everything and handing it off to her coworkers, she packed up her things into a box. Just as she finished, Eric walked in. He glanced at her empty desk and was a bit caught off guard. ""Why are you packing up?"" Elie was about to answer, but he seemed to remember something and nodded. ""Yeah. Now that you've been promoted, you'll have your own office. You can pack up later. Come with me first."" Without waiting for her response, he turned and left. Elie hesitated for a second, then quietly followed him to the auction venue. Clara was already there. When she saw Elie, a hint of disdain crossed her face as she stepped up and grabbed Eric's arm. ""Eric, I've already picked out the jewelry I want. No matter what, you have to buy all of it for me."" Eric smiled dotingly and helped her sit down. ""Don't worry. Whatever you want, I'll get it."" Elie stood quietly in the corner, watching them laugh and flirt, but she felt nothing. Once the auction started, Eric would buy everything Clara had her eye on. His over-the-top bids had the whole room stunned, with people turning to stare. ""Bidding on everything she wants? Mr. Lawrence is spoiling his girlfriend. She gets whatever she wants, like a personal wishing well. Ms. Grayson must've been a hero in a past life or something."" ""I heard that ever since they started dating, Ms. Grayson's gotten whatever she wanted. Guess nothing's changed after all these years. Mr. Lawrence is infatuated."" Clara beamed at all the jealous praise. She casually tossed the auction catalog at Elie, then turned to Eric and started acting cute. ""I wanna use the restroom. Eric, come with me?"" Eric got up without hesitation, leaving Elie with a quick instruction. ""Bid on everything that's marked in the catalog."" Elie said nothing, just nodded, and made sure to bid on every single item as told. Just as Elie was about to leave, the auctioneer suddenly introduced a brand-new item. ""Ladies and gentlemen, we're now moving on to the surprise lot of the evening—a pinkish-purple necklace featuring a 40.52-carat Alexandrite. The starting price is 1.5 million."" The surprise item caught everyone off guard, and the sparkling necklace immediately stole the spotlight. Bids quickly erupted throughout the room, driving the necklace's price sky-high. Elie took a photo and sent it to Eric, asking if he wanted to bid on it. But Eric didn't reply. She tried calling a few times, but he didn't pick up. While she was still trying to reach him, the necklace was sold for 80 million. The moment the final bid was called, Clara happened to come back. Clara spotted the necklace and instantly wanted it. When she realized it had been sold, she picked up a glass of red wine and poured it on Elie's face. ""I told you to bid on everything I liked! What the hell were you doing?"" Elie's hair and clothes were soaked. She clenched her hands tightly, trying hard to keep her voice calm. ""This necklace wasn't in the catalog. It was a surprise item. I called Mr. Lawrence, but he didn't answer..."" But Clara didn't care about her explanation. She turned to Eric with a pitiful look. ""Eric, not only is Elie useless, but now she also shirks responsibility! I don't care. I want that necklace. If you don't get it for me, I will ignore you."" Eric had seen Elie's message and knew it wasn't her fault. But in front of Clara, he couldn't defend Elie. He could only go along and try to soothe Clara. ""Have I ever said no to something you wanted? Be good, I'll have someone buy it back right now."" He called over a staff member, his tone stern. ""Find the buyer and negotiate. If they're willing to give it up, meet any condition they ask."" Elie stood silently, her wet shirt stuck to her body, and wine still dripping from her hair. Seeing the smug look on Clara's face, she suddenly had a bad feeling. The staff member came back quickly, looking a bit uneasy. ""Mr. Lawrence, the buyer agreed to hand over the necklace, but..."" ""Go on,"" Eric said, frowning. ""He has one condition..."" the staff member said hesitantly. ""He wants your secretary to spend the night with him. He said..."" He braced himself and continued, ""He said she may look plain, but after having nothing but gourmet meals, sometimes it's nice to try something simple."" Chapter 8 Elie was struck as if by lightning, and she looked up suddenly at Clara. The smug smile at the corner of the other's mouth confirmed her guess, which she couldn't hide in time. What hidden items, what mysterious buyers, all are carefully designed traps. ""Mr. Lawrence, Elie's voice trembled, ""you can't agree, I'm leaving after today..."" ""Eric,"" Clara suddenly threw herself into Eric's arms, interrupting him, ""I want that necklace! You promised me."" She looked up, tears welling in her eyes, ""Am I not as important to you as a secretary in your heart?"" Eric looked down at Clara in his arms, then glanced at the pale-faced Elie. He wiped away Clara's tears with his hand and whispered, ""Don't cry."" Then he turned to the staff and said, ""Tell the buyer, deal done."" Elie's blood froze in an instant: ""Eric! You can't-"" Before the words had even finished, someone had already grabbed her arm. She struggled desperately, her nails scratching blood marks on the bodyguard's arm: ""Let me go! Eric! I'm quitting tomorrow! You have no right..."" Her voice was cut off by the slamming of the car door. The black sedan sped away, and in the rearview mirror, Eric was gently putting a coat on Clara. In the luxury suite, Elie was pushed in roughly. With a click, the door locked behind her, and she turned around to see a beggar covered in dirt greedily staring at her. The beggar grinned, revealing his uneven yellow teeth. Elie trembled all over, staggering backwards. ""Don't come any closer... I can give you money..."" ""Money? The beggar grabbed her wrist, his foul breath hitting her face as he chuckled. ""The money that lady gave me is enough to last me a lifetime! I don't need money now, I need a woman!"" Elie was desperate and could only grab the desk lamp for self-defense. When the beggar pounced on her, she fiercely smashed his head. Blood flowed down his forehead, instead arousing his ferocity. ""Jerk! he grabbed her hair and threw her onto the bed."" The sound of fabric tearing was particularly harsh in the room. Elie's nails left deep blood marks on the beggar's face, but they were no match for the man's strength. Just when she was completely desperate— ""Bang!"" The door was kicked open. Eric's bodyguard rushed in and quickly subdued the beggar. ""Ms. Roberts, the bodyguard holding out a coat began, ""Mr. Lawrence sent us to rescue you."" Elie shivered as she wrapped her coat tightly around her, reaching for her phone to call the police. The bodyguard quickly snatched the phone: ""Mr. Lawrence instructed that you cannot call the police."" ""What does it mean? Elie asked hoarsely."" ""Ms. Grayson didn't mean it, she just wanted to vent. Mr. Lawrence has already arranged for someone to save you, you're fine, let's just forget about it."" Elie was struck as if by lightning: ""He... knew?"" The bodyguard resigned. Elie suddenly laughed, laughing so hard that tears streamed down his face. Originally, Eric knew everything, but still allowed Clara to push her towards the abyss. Her eyes welled up with tears, ""What if I had to call the police?"" ""No one in New York dares to take your case, the bodyguard said expressionlessly. ""Mr. Lawrence said to give you a week off, so you can rest well these days, consider it as compensation."" After speaking, the bodyguard's figure disappeared at the end of the corridor, and the door made a soft ""click"" sound. Elie sat down slowly on the ground, pressing his fingertips deeply into the palm of his hand. The suit jacket slipped off her shoulders, revealing a torn collar. She reached out to pick it up, only to find her hand shaking uncontrollably. The phone suddenly rang, and the word ""Mom"" on the screen stabbed her eyes. ""Elie, have you finished the handover? Have you arranged all the blind dates?"" Elie bit down hard on his lower lip, the taste of rust spreading in his mouth, but it was nothing compared to the pain in his heart. ""Okay, Mom, she heard her own terrifyingly calm voice, ""I'll go back today."" The moment the phone hung up, tears finally burst out. Ten years of time passed by like a revolving lantern in front of my eyes. On the college campus, the figure of a young man walking against the light. In the president's office, his breath was scorching hot after he got drunk. And tonight, he uttered the indifferent words ""deal"" as well. Every frame of memory turned into a sharp knife, tearing her heart apart. Ten years of infatuation, resulted in one trampling after another. Elie slowly stood up, picked up the coat on the ground, straightened out his disheveled clothes, and returned to the apartment alone. Her emotions had completely calmed down. Within just thirty minutes, she calmly cancelled the apartment rental, packed all her belongings, left the keys behind, and took a taxi with her suitcase. The taxi drove through the puddles and headed towards the airport. There was a one-way ticket leading to a life without Eric.",1,1752821996.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

No one dies.

The man walks to my booth.

And stares at me through the glass.

He mouths something.

Your turn.

I run.

I drive for hours, but every road curves back. No matter where I go, the signs repeat: “Open 24 Hours.”

Eventually, I stop fighting.

I sit in the booth.

This time, the man doesn't show.

The clock hits 2:38.

The waitress stops humming.

And speaks.

“Mr. Delaney?”

I blink.

She’s not the waitress anymore.

She’s wearing a headset and a lab coat.

The walls shimmer. The trucker and the couple flicker and vanish.

My booth dissolves.

And I’m sitting in a padded chair.

Wires in my arms. A visor over my face.

Dozens of people stare from behind glass.

A voice crackles over the speaker. “Subject 79 is awake. Loop cycle broken.”

I try to stand but fall to my knees.

My mouth is dry. My hands shake.

A man approaches slowly, palms out. “You paid for a 30-minute adrenaline run. Armed robbery scenario. Extreme immersion. But your vitals dropped. You’ve been under for nearly nine hours. We had to force a manual break.”

I can’t breathe.

“You experienced minor neural echo. Some patients struggle to distinguish simulated memory from real.”

“What?” I whisper.

“You’ve been safe the whole time. But your mind adapted to the loop. You believed it.”

He crouches. “Do you know where you are now?”

I stare at him as he lifts his hand.

And drive my thumb into his eye.

Security pulls me off him, screaming. Blood on my hands. His body twitching.

I sob.

“I thought he was going to shoot me.”

The glass behind them flickers.

And I see it.

The diner.

Still running.

Clock stuck at 2:37.

I thought they pulled me out?

Maybe they can’t.

Maybe part of me is still in that booth.

That wedding dress wasn’t mine. Those guests weren’t mine. That gold ring that would be placed on my finger wasn’t mine. That groom at the altar wasn’t mine.

When I entered the church and all eyes turned to me, it felt like a silent accusation. They knew that the ceremony was theater.

My heart was beating fast, and my head was spinning, telling me to get out of there. For a minute, I looked at the door behind me, but it only took Dad’s hard stare to make me take the first step.

“Come on, Laura, you can do it,” I muttered to myself.

As I approached the altar, he was there. James, wearing his expensive dark suit, his hair gelled and his face impatiently.

I smiled under my veil, trying to disguise my nervousness, but he didn’t even look in my direction.

While the priest was giving a beautiful sermon about the wedding, I could see how irritated he was. James put the ring on my finger with such force that I let out a groan of pain.

By the time the priest said, “I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.”

He left the church without looking back, leaving me alone at the altar.

“Enjoy the party,” he shouted from the doorway.

The whispers started as a low hum and grew until they echoed throughout the church. I felt my face burn under the veil as I stood paralyzed at the altar, the bouquet trembling in my hands, and an overwhelming desire to cry.

“Laura, congratulations on the wedding,” someone said.

I couldn’t reply.

The air left my lungs as if I had been punched. My legs went weak, and I had to lean on the altar to keep from falling.

The bouquet slipped from my numb fingers and fell to the floor with a dull thud. Every word the guests said was like a new stab in my chest. I looked at my father, silently begging him to help me. But his face was pale, his eyes shifted to the floor.

“Laura...” someone said next to me, but I was already running.

I crossed the church aisle like a white blur, tripping over the dress that wasn’t mine, tearing off the veil that was stifling my sobs. The guests stood up in their places, but no one tried to stop me.

My trembling hands pushed open the church door, but at that moment a powerful hand grabbed my arm, its fingers digging into my skin like claws. The grip was familiar - my father always knew exactly how much force to use to hurt without leaving marks on my skin.

“Laura, don’t embarrass the family,” he hissed close to my ear, his voice calm but laden with menace. “Let’s go to the party. There’s a big celebration waiting for us.”

“What’s there to celebrate?”

The drive to the ballroom was a silent torture in the back of the limousine. My stepmother Eva kept complaining about how I had “ruined” the perfect ceremony she had planned. Her words mingled with the noise of the engine, turning into an irritating hum as I watched the city pass by the window, feeling like a prisoner on her way to her sentence.

“You need to smile,” my father ordered, his eyes meeting mine.

There was no warmth in his words, just the coldness of a business executive closing yet another deal.

Eva shifted in her seat. She displayed a fake concern on her face.

“The wedding day is the happiest day in a woman’s life,” she declared in that sugary voice she always used in public. “All the magazines say so.”

I felt a solitary tear run down my cheek as I looked at my hands, the wedding ring shining like a golden handcuff.

“Then why do I feel so sad?”

“You’ve always been dramatic,” Eva replied with an exasperated sigh, exchanging a complicated glance with my father. “Just like your mother.”

The mention of my mother was like a slap, but I swallowed the words I wanted to say. After all, that’s what they expected of me - to swallow the pain, smile and pretend that this really was the happiest day of my life.

“You married one of the richest men in the country; you should be happy,” my father argued.

“I don’t care about money. I wanted to marry for love,” I mumbled.

I arrived at the party, and everything was very luxurious.

Crystal lights reflected off the polished marble, creating an ethereal atmosphere in the hall. Silver candlesticks adorned the tables covered with champagne silk tablecloths, while elaborate arrangements of white orchids perfumed the room.

“Where’s James?” one guest whispered to another as I walked past.

I tried to keep my smile as I walked between the tables, feeling the looks of pity and curiosity following me. The bridal waltz began to play, but there was no one to dance with me.

“Laura, darling,” James’ mother approached, her smile as fake as the pearls around my neck. “James had an emergency at work. You understand, don’t you? He’s a very busy man.”

“Of course, Mrs. Reynolds,” I replied mechanically.

The five-tiered cake remained untouched, a masterpiece in shades of ivory and gold that no one dared to cut. The champagne glasses were filled and emptied quickly, as if the guests were trying to drown their embarrassment.

“This is unacceptable,” I heard my father mutter to Eva. “He won’t even take my calls.”

“Laura,” my cousin Alice approached, her eyes full of genuine concern. “You don’t have to stay here.”

“Yes, I do,” I whispered, looking at the empty seat next to me at the head table. “This is my punishment, isn’t it?”

“I told you to run away, too.”

A server passed by, offering more champagne. I took a glass and drank it in one gulp, feeling the bubbly liquid burn my throat along with the tears I refused to shed.

“Let’s make a toast to the bride and groom!” someone shouted, clearly drunk.

The silence that followed was deafening.

“Smile, Laura,” Eva whispered, squeezing my shoulder. “The photographers are still here.”

The orchestra continued playing romantic songs to a room where love was conspicuously absent, as was the groom.

After saying goodbye to the last guest, I went to the bedroom and, to my surprise, my husband was there. Sitting in a leather armchair, a document in his hands and an expression of utter contempt on his face.

“Are you in here?” I asked nervously.

“This is my room.”

I looked around, and everything was as cold as the man in front of me. His blue eyes were like icebergs in the northern seas.

“Let me make the terms very clear,” he said, his voice as sharp as ice. “First, you’re not my real wife. This is a business arrangement.”

I stood, still wearing the wedding dress that wasn’t mine, while he leafed through the contract.

“Second, you will sleep in the guest room at the end of the corridor. Or on the floor, if you prefer. I don’t mind.”

“I’m not quitting my job,” I declared, surprising us both with the firmness in my voice.

James looked up from the document, a cruel smile forming on his lips. “Oh, yes, you are. A wife from the Reynolds family doesn’t work in just any bookshop.”

“You can’t make me.”

“I can and I will,” he stood up, approaching like a predator. “Or have you forgotten the deal your father made? The debt he owes me? All it takes is one phone call from me to the lawyers, and your father will spend the rest of his life in jail.”

I felt my eyes sting with restrained tears. “But I like my job.”

“Too bad.”

“What else is in this contract?”

“Public appearances when necessary. Family dinners on Sundays. Smiles at social events,” he listed coldly. “And, of course, absolute secrecy about the nature of our arrangement.”

“For how long?”

“Until I decide it’s over.” James threw the contract on the bed. “Sign the last page. And Laura...” he paused in the doorway, “don’t kid yourself that this will ever change. My heart belongs to someone else.”

I picked up the pen with trembling fingers, each word of the contract weighing like lead in my chest.

He looked at me for a few seconds. “Laura, don’t ever wear fake jewelry again; that’s ridiculous.”

I touched my necklace in shame.

“Welcome to hell, Ms. Reynolds,” he said before leaving, leaving me alone with my new reality.

I let my body collapse onto the bed and cried.

# Chapter 2: The Morning After

The next morning, the breakfast room of the Reynolds mansion was a masterpiece in shades of cream and gold. The morning light streamed through the French windows, making the fine china sparkle on the impeccably set table.

“Good morning, dear daughter-in-law,” Mrs. Reynolds said as I entered, her voice too sweet to be sincere. “I hope you slept well in the guest room.”

I blushed as I realized that she knew exactly where I had spent the night. I think everyone did.

“Coffee’s served, ma’am,” the housekeeper announced, placing a tray of freshly baked croissants on the table.

James was already there, hiding behind the financial newspaper, with his untouched black coffee in front of him. He didn’t even raise his eyes when I sat down.

“Laura, darling, you need to eat more,” Catherine Reynolds said, pushing a plate of eggs benedict towards me. “You’re too thin. What will people think? That you’re sick.”

“That she doesn’t live up to the Reynolds’ name, as usual,” Margaret, James’ sister, entered the room, her heels tapping on the marble floor. “Good morning, little brother.”

James finally put down the paper to smile at his sister. It was the first genuine smile I’d seen him give since the wedding.

“The coffee’s cold,” he said dryly to the housekeeper, ignoring my presence. “Bring another.”

“So, Laura,” Margaret leaned over the table, her eyes twinkling with mischief, “have you got used to your new position yet? It must be quite an adjustment, considering your origins.”

Before I could reply, James intervened.

“Laura knows exactly where you stand in this house, don’t you, dear?”

The tone of his voice made my stomach turn. I nodded silently, staring at the untouched cup of tea in front of me.

“Oh, I almost forgot.” Mrs. Catherine pulled a gold envelope from her purse. “Charity ball on Friday. Laura, dear, I’ll send my personal seamstress over this afternoon. We need to make sure you’re…presentable.”

“That won’t be necessary,” James folded the newspaper methodically. “Laura has other commitments.”

“But son…”

“I said no.” He stood, straightening his jacket. “Excuse me, I have an important meeting.”

When he left, the silence hung over the table like a toxic cloud. I could feel the two women’s eyes assessing me, judging me, as the croissants cooled, untouched, like my appetite for the life that was now mine.

“The driver is waiting, James,” Mrs. Reynolds said softly.

“I don’t need a driver, Mom. Laura will drive me,” James declared, making everyone at the table freeze.

“Me?” I asked, surprised at the first time he had given me a direct task.

“Yes. Since you insist on working, you can start by being useful. Be my personal chauffeur,” he smiled coldly. “After all, I can’t have my wife working at some random bookstore, but driving for me… that’s acceptable, don’t you think?”

Margaret let out a mocking laugh as I felt my face heat up.

“James, dear, are you sure?” her mother asked, clearly uncomfortable.

“Absolutely.” He tossed the Audi keys in my direction. “Don’t keep me waiting, Laura.”

On shaky legs, I stood up from the table. Mrs. Reynolds sighed heavily.

“Laura,” she called as I stood at the door. “Remember: you’re a Reynolds now. Even if… well, even under the current circumstances.”

In the hallway, James was waiting for me with an expression of pure disdain.

“Rule number one: don’t talk to me during the ride. Rule number two: keep an appropriate distance from other drivers. And rule number three,” he leaned closer, his expensive cologne invading my senses, “don’t you dare think of this as an opportunity to bond. It’s a punishment.”

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

“Because I can,” he replied simply. “And because I want you to understand exactly where you belong in this family.”

The sound of our footsteps echoed down the marble hallway, each click of my heels reminding me that this was just another of the many humiliations to come.

“You have twenty minutes.”

The Audi’s plush interior was a stark contrast to the ice that had settled between us. I kept my eyes fixed on the road, remembering the first rule: no talking during the ride. Each red light seemed to last forever.

James sighed in irritation every time I slowed down, but I remained silent. The sound of his fingers on his cell phone was the only soundtrack to that tense morning.

“Incompetent,” he muttered as I stopped at yet another traffic light.

I bit my lip to keep from answering. His rules echoed in my mind: don’t talk, don’t come near, keep your distance.

I watched him in the rearview mirror of the car.

James Reynolds was the kind of man who made women sigh when he walked into a room. Tall, almost 6’3"", his broad shoulders perfectly filled out his tailored Italian suits. His black hair, always smoothed with gel, highlighted his aristocratic features - defined jaw, straight nose, thick eyebrows that shaded sapphire-blue eyes. But they were cold, calculating eyes that never smiled, even when his well-shaped lips curved into a social smile.

When we finally pulled up in front of the imposing Reynolds Enterprises building, James got out of the car and slammed the door shut, his perfectly tailored Italian suit a stark contrast to his stormy expression.

I let my tense muscles relax for a brief moment, but then I noticed the black leather briefcase was still in the backseat.

“James,” I called softly through the window, but he had already disappeared through the revolving doors.

I looked at the briefcase, my heart racing. There were important documents in there, I knew. Documents he would need for the meeting.

Rule number one echoed in my mind again: no talking during the ride.

But the ride was over, and I didn’t have his phone number. I didn’t have my husband’s phone number. Undecided, I stared at the briefcase for no more than a few seconds.

I glanced at myself in the rearview mirror to check my appearance, which needed to be perfect. My shoulder-length blonde hair and light makeup were presentable.

I headed toward the reception to hand it over.

Distracted by my anxiety, I didn’t notice the unevenness on the floor. When I realized it, I had already tripped, feeling a sharp pain in my knee. A slight cut, but enough to make the blood run.

“Damn,” I muttered.

I stood up with a nervous urge, heading quickly to the building’s reception area. My hurried footsteps echoed throughout the room.

“Where is James Reynolds’ office?”

“Who wants it?” the receptionist asked with an inquisitive look, shaking my resolve.

I hesitated for a brief moment before answering.

“I’m Laura, his wife.”

The words came out like venom, each syllable imbued with a resentment I could barely contain.

“Penthouse. Use the private elevator,” she replied without hesitation.

The elevator doors opened to reveal a large reception area with a glass wall. Through the reflection, I saw James, absorbed in a phone call, sitting majestically behind his desk.

“How can someone so handsome be so cruel?” I muttered to myself.

I felt a chill run down my spine when our eyes met - his, as cold as a steel blade.

“What do you think you’re doing?” he questioned, approaching me irritably.

“You forgot something in the car. I don’t have your phone number to let you know,” I replied, trying to remain calm.

For a few seconds, his gaze examined me thoroughly, until he came across my bleeding knee.

One of his secretaries appeared in the doorway, she was dressed in an outfit that was too sexy for a simple secretary.

“Sir, meeting in a minute,” she announced, and her eyes rested on me for a moment.

“Let them wait,” he said, with an indifferent tone that left no room for debate.

His eyes looked at me again, intense. “Come to my office.”

I hesitated, torn between the instinct to retreat and the curiosity his words had aroused.

“Are you just going to stand there?”

The impatience in his voice made me react, and I quickened my pace to follow him.

When I reached the living room, he stared at me with a mixture of suspicion and authority.

“How did you get hurt?” he asked, but his tone was more of a demand than any sign of concern.

“It was just a fall. Nothing serious,” I mumbled, looking away.

“Sit down.”

Without waiting for an answer, he left the room. Before I could decide whether to obey, he returned, carrying antiseptic and a pack of Band-Aids. He placed the items on the table between us with a direct gesture.

“Take care of it,” he ordered, his voice thick with authority.

“It’s nothing,” I insisted, in the same hushed tone as before.

“I didn’t ask if it was,” he replied, his eyes fixed on mine. “How many times do I have to repeat myself?” he said, his tone sharp. “You’re a Reynolds now. You can’t go around looking like that, slovenly. This isn’t about you, it’s about my family’s reputation.”

Those words fell like a stone to my stomach. For a foolish moment, I even believed there was some trace of genuine concern in his attitude.

It was just pride, nothing more.

Before I could react, he grabbed my phone, his movements quick and precise. Without asking for permission, he typed something and handed it back to me.

“You now have my number,” he declared, cold as ever. “Call only in cases of life or death.”

I swallowed hard, fighting the urge to say something that would only make the situation worse. I simply closed my hand around the phone, a silent reminder of who was in control.

# Chapter 3: Eva

My stepmother called me saying she needed to speak to me urgently. Her only pressing matters were money or Molly, my stepsister.

When I entered the coffee shop, I saw her sitting at the back table. She was impeccably dressed in a navy blue dress that highlighted her elegant figure. The smile on her lips was refined and discreet.

“Laura, my dear, you look great. Marriage really does work miracles, doesn’t it?”

Eva began, with that honeyed tone that I recognized as the prelude to something disturbing.

“Eva. Why did you ask me to come here, to this place far from home?”

Eva raised her eyebrows, feigning surprise.

“I wanted to talk to you away from your father. You know he has a weak heart.”

“I don’t have much time.”

“But okay, I’ll get straight to the point. I’m in a delicate situation, my dear. Some unexpected bills, an investment opportunity I can’t miss… You understand, don’t you? After all, who doesn’t want a better future?”

I narrowed my eyes. “And what’s that to me?”

Eva smiled, leaning forward.

“You’re married to a powerful and financially comfortable man. I thought it might be a good time to show him that you can contribute to the family business, too. Perhaps a discreet request for money to help with my situation?”

I felt my stomach churn. “You want me to ask James for money? Is that it?”

“Exactly! He would never say no to you if he knew how to ask. We women have our tricks.”

Eva gave a wicked smile. “And speaking of which, dear, you should think about getting pregnant soon. Nothing binds a man more than an heir. And honestly, he’s over thirty.”

My face burned with anger and humiliation. “You must know that well.”

“Oh, but it is, dear. I’m only thinking about your well-being.”

Eva paused, watching my reaction. Then, with a darker expression, she added. “And I know things between you and James aren’t exactly perfect. Or should I say... I know you slept in the guest room on your wedding night.”

I felt the ground shift beneath my feet. “How do you know that?”

Eva gave me a victorious smile.

“I have my ways. Don’t think you can fool me, Laura. James is no fool, and you should take advantage of the position you have while you can. If you keep this up, you’ll end up like your mother: alone and with nothing.”

The mention of my mother was the breaking point. I stood up suddenly, the chair scraping against the floor with a sharp sound.",1,1752821898.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Down below I've summarized how many Meta Jewels or equivalents you get per euro spent for each individual pack.

Some disclaimers though. I've only put a value on gacha items, as such anything that isn't a Cognition Crystal, Meta Jewel, Platinum or Gold ticket or Platinum Milicoin has a value of 0. I have also not been able to find every single pack as different accounts have access to different items in the store, depending on their previous purchases. But I should've gotten the vast majority.

Both Gold Tickets and Platinum Tickets are valued the same at 150 meta jewels each. Do keep that in mind. Milicoins are valued at 100 meta jewels.

For the sake of Lv. threshold sets, Cognition Crystals are valued at either 70 per euro or 140. 70 is for those of you who have already purchased all the Cognition Crystals in the shop once.

A few things to take away from this:

Predictably, Martym's Reward is by far the best pack you could buy. 

The Limited sets for Milicoin and Platinum Tickets are absolute scams. Stay away from those.

The best Cognition Crystal pack is the 2500 one.

Martym's Reward Card without the monthly rewards contains a comparable amount of jewels to the crystal packs without the bonus. I'd buy this multiple times before buying Crystals without the bonus. 

The first few level up sets are pretty decent. 

The special Battle Pass is decent in terms of jewels and has so many raw resources on top of that. Worth consideration if you reach at least level 50 in it. It also has an additional 4 Platinum Gecko coins which can be exchanged for a 5 star weapon for 10 a piece.",17,1752821689.0,personaphantomx,2,0.9,False

So instead, I just took omeprazole occasionally, prescribed by a clinic.

A few days ago, though, things got so bad I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I finally got an endoscopy and, not surprisingly, tested positive for:
	1.	H. pylori
	2.	Hiatal hernia
	3.	NERD (non-erosive reflux disease)
	4.	Duodenitis

The doctor started me on treatment and now I’m just waiting on the biopsy results.

Here’s where it gets really hard: all the things I love — coffee (which I used to drink every day), spicy food, citrus fruits, alcohol, weed, nicotine — I now have to completely avoid, especially during treatment. I’ve read that these things can interfere with H. pylori eradication, so I’m doing my best to stay away from them, but it’s honestly been brutal.

Right now, my diet is basically bland chicken broth with some protein and noodles. That’s it. I’m Asian, and the lack of flavor is soul-crushing. I miss real food so much I could cry.

Another big issue is vaping. I quit cold turkey when I started the treatment, but the withdrawal symptoms are hitting me hard. Between that and the side effects of the antibiotics, I feel like I’m losing it. My lips are dry, my brain is foggy, and I feel this terrible, irrational sense of doom constantly. I’m hungry all the time, but even a tiny bit of food makes me feel bloated and full.

So I guess my questions are:
	•	Is it really necessary to avoid every single one of those triggers 100%, even just a few puffs of nicotine? Would a puff or two a day ruin the treatment?
	•	After this whole thing is over, will I still have to avoid things like coffee forever?
	•	How did others cope with the emotional toll and lifestyle change during treatment?

This is only Day 2 of treatment, and I already feel like my brain is barely holding it together — hence why I turned to ChatGPT to help get my thoughts out.

(Which yanno, takes place in the street) a few quotes below 👇 

 “you did it, you made good trouble, now please get out of the street” 

“Get the fuck out of the street you assholes!” 

When Rev. Dr. MLK Jr. wrote the letter from a Birmingham jail, he specifically mentioned the actions of the crowd today and their strict adherence to law and order over rights and liberties others. Below is the excerpt: 

Every year on Martin Luther King Day, I’m reminded of these words, from Letter from a Birmingham Jail:

“I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.”- Rev. Dr. MLK Jr. 

It is disturbing yet fascinating that we got to see it happen again today at protest. That certain men and women attempted to get violent and confrontational with the people who know their history and understand what “good trouble” actually is. 

Did MLK and John Lewis march in the streets? 
DUH 

Did they cause disturbances and disruptions in segregated cities, segregated business, segregated buses? 
DOUBLE DUH

Did MLK and John Lewis break the fucking law doing these activities? 
TRIPLE DUH

Do some you people out here divorce the reality of the Non Violent Direct Action and past civil rights movements and leaders actions whose memories and experiences you invoke to play dress up with and hold signs? 

I think so. But that’s my personal opinion.
I think the majority of the people at 50501 are the exact people , the exact mindset that made the civil rights movement so goddamn difficult. 

And again, we are protesting a dictator that is throwing people in concentration camps…. 
Let’s just compare this for the folks who may be a little dense. 

One occupied block and a march of Non-violent Protesters 

vs. 

-a secret police having a bigger budget than the marines 
-concentration camps 
-suspension of rights and laws and precedents
-protecting powerful pedophiles 
-racist targeting of minorities communities 
 
One of these things is over as of 9PM. 
The other 5 will continue to happen tomorrow. 
So yes liberals, you really need to unfuck yourselves and figure out which is a threat to your liberty tomorrow when you sip your Starbucks coffee and chow down on BEC biscuit from Mc Donald’s. I mean it. Chew it over on your drive to work and figure out which one you should be angry at. 

And the Media is going to do whatever the media wants to do sell more newspapers and ad revenue . I can’t believe I heard that excuse. What’s the matter. You think Fox News is going to suddenly change is rhetoric about protesters that don’t like Trump if everyone is a good model citizen at a protest. 

Please. Grow the fuck up. These people want you dead. They intentionally lie to their audience about everything you stand for. Every day. They aren’t going to change their narrative,  or be fair, or be cavalier or anything remotely civilized toward you. 

And no, not everyone in a mask or wearing black is out to start shit or turn a protest in riot. Most people who take the precautions to not to let fascists or DPD figure out their identities are playing it smart. Pick a history book and read about any fascist installed dictatorship supported by the United States Government and quickly find out what happened to the people who thought showing their face at a protest was a great idea. 

If you think it won’t happen here, you are being absolutely foolish. DPD literally sent SWAT to your carnival and got so frustrated when everyone minded their Ps and Qs they decided to parade at the end up and down the streets to be assholes about it.

“Look at me, we have militarized gear, we get to play dress up for a riot that will never happen to intimidate protesters!” -DPD 

If these words seem harsh or unfair or even inappropriate to harmful, consider your own conduct before firing back. This isn’t our first rodeo. We know what works and what doesn’t. 
Being cute and waving signs didn’t work in 1962. Still that way in 2025. 

I do appreciate the people who had the INTEGRITY to come back and apologize and explain they assumed we were Bad trouble. 
The sort that makes the entire effort look terrible. I don’t think anyone out there who chooses to attend and march with the people, the groups and the movement are every single time are bad people. The time, the effort, the money and the actions are clearly from people who care about their neighbors. People who choose to support their neighbors regardless of status. 

So in August I really hope most of y’all get a grip on reality and figure out why are you are there. I hope you take the time to discover the wonders of the internet and the fascinating effect education has on the mind. Since a lot of yall don’t know who John Lewis was clearly, start here and work backward thru the civil rights movement to figure out if you’re the white moderate or “radical liberal of the 1960s” marching with the oppressed, screaming for freedom.

Happy with my career, have build a rich life around me, love to travel, have a core friendship group and i like my own company a lot. But with everything still the tinge of loneliness remains. It is almost like having a beautiful garden full of trees flowers and fruits but no one to share it with. You crave having someone to debrief the day with, share the morning coffee with and as more and more time passes by, the more anxious and sad i am getting about this. I have tried dating but i end up over giving and getting attached and eventually getting ghosted. And it has exhausted me now. I recently met someone who matched me on quite some factors and i was ready to let go of little red flags i saw but he has also essentially ghosted me out of the blue and i had promised myself this is the last time i will have a go at dating. It feels like i have experienced so many heartbreaks and let downs in the past 1 year that i have given up. 
I want to ask how do we even find love as a 30 year old in India, where you dont have so many avenues to meet genuine people (lets be honest) and dating platforms are being abused like a shopping market.

I roll over with a gro-an and stretch to pick up my phone. I read the time and then rub my eyes before checking the time again because there’s no way I read it right. Glancing around the room I feel confident that my eyes are now working correctly and check the time again.

“Mother fluffer!” I curse under my breath. I was right the first time. It’s 5:30 AM! That confirms my suspicions that perfect Jenna with the too-friendly smile is evil. It’s the first day of university and classes start at 9 AM. Why on earth is she waking the whole dorm up at 5:30? I can hear grumbling and cursing from the other girls through the paper-thin walls as Jenna loudly announces that it’s shower time. I grab the pillow and press it over my head to try and block out the noise. I had my alarm set for 8 AM, which would have given me plenty of time to shower and have breakfast before our first class. I manage to block out enough of the noise that I start drifting back to sleep. BANG, BANG, BANG!

“Josie Banks, room number 5, I don’t hear any movement in there!” Jenna’s sickly sweet voice calls through the door as she hammers on it, then she begins to rattle the door handle. With a huff I chuck my pillow on the floor, throw back my covers and get up, stomping to the door I yank it open.

“It is 5:30 AM!” I hiss at Jenna. She smiles with fake sympathy as she looks me up and down.

“I am aware of the time Miss Banks, but this year’s stock is going to need extra time to get ready if we are going to make any of you look presentable,” she grins.

“We are not cattle,” I huff and begin to shut the door in her face. She stops it with a foot in the doorway and looks down at her clipboard.

“Josie Banks, eighteen years old, here to study criminology. Father is deceased, mother suffers from psychosis and currently resides in a secure hospital. Josie needs support to process her emotions and would benefit greatly from structure and routine. Josie has no other living rel…” I cut her off by robing the clipboard from her hand and reading the information sheet she had on me. With every word I read of my personal information, my anger grows, like each letter adds fuel to the already growing fire within me. Who gave her this information? She’s just a senior student with a voluntary role as dorm leader, she has no right or need for this information. This is a breach of privacy.

“How did you get this?” I seeth. Students gather in the corridor, their attention now focused on the drama unfolding in front of them.

“As the dorm leader, I am privy to any information that may help me to support you,” Jenna states, holding her head high like she feels superior. “It was in the enrolment statement, that you signed and agreed to when you accepted your place within this university,” she adds. I tear the page from the clip holding it down and slam the board into her heart.

“You had no right to that information, and you certainly had no right to broadcast it to the whole dorm,” I shout as I shove her away from my door. There’s a brief look of shock on her face as her head cracks against the wall before her expression goes blank and she slumps down to the floor with a thud. There's a distinct crack in the plaster on the wall where she hit it. Gasps sound out down the hall as I slam the door. I lean against it in disbelief, looking down at my hands in disgust.

“Someone call an ambulance!” I hear one of the girls in the hall shout.

How did that just happen? I didn't shove her that hard did I?… no, it's not possible, I'm not that strong and I barely touched her. She must have tripped on something and hit her head. That crack in the wall must have already been there and I'd just not noticed it until now.

“Is she breathing?” I hear a panicked voice ask. I don't hear the answer as my ears begin to ring and my heart begins to pound loudly. I feel as if the oxygen has been svcked out of the room as I draw in gasping lungfuls of useless air. My heart tightens with every breath like more and more weight is being added on top of me. My vision goes blurry before turning completely black, then I become light, and the weight lifts from me as I relax into peaceful darkness.

“Miss Banks wake up!” a stern voice penetrates the blissful bubble of silence I had fallen into. I blink open my eyes, letting my blurry vision adjust to take in the figure hovering above me. It's a plump lady with a grim-faced expression that I don't recognise.

“Who are you?” I murmur, pushing myself up into a sitting position and looking around to take in my surroundings.

“ I'm Officer Shelby, I'm with the Mount University Police. We need to take you down to the station,” she gives me a sympathetic smile as she pulls me up to my feet. In the broken doorway of my room stands another police officer. This one is looking curiously between me, the doorway and the crack in the wall where Jenna had been slumped. I svck in a breath as I remember what had happened. Jenna is no longer there, which is good. I must have passed out for a short time and she had reported me to the police for causing her to fall.

“I'm sorry officer, this was all a bit of a misunderstanding. I didn't mean for her to fall, I just pushed her out of my doorway so I could close my door and…” I begin to explain until the officer holds up a hand to stop me.

“Save it for the interview honey,” she says softly, whilst guiding me out of the building and into the back of a waiting police car. My fellow students watch on, giving looks of pity, smirks and utter disgust as I pass… perfect, I've made a great first impression.

Chapter 2

For the next few hours, I watch the clock in the small room they have me locked in. I’d drank my small paper cup of water hours ago and I've counted every tiny crack I can find in the plastered walls at least ten times. Just when I'm at the point of driving myself completely insane by mentally replaying what happened with Jenna over and over again, the door opens. The male officer that I'd seen in my dorm room earlier walks in and takes the seat opposite me at the table.

“Sorry to keep you waiting Miss Banks,” he says, laying a paper folder out on the table. He opens it and begins to read through it in silence. The seconds tick by and I start to get fidgety in my seat at the uncomfortable silence. Just as I open my mouth to break the silence the door opens again and a tall man wearing an expensive-looking suit walks in holding a briefcase. The man looks down at me in an assessing way. He is extremely good-looking and exudes dominance in a way that makes him hard to look at.

“Is this her?” he says in an almost snort, jer-king his chin in my direction.

“Yes, Sir,” the police officer nods, motioning for the newcomer to sit next to him. He takes his seat and reads through the paperwork the officer hands to him. I study his face as he reads. He's one of those ageless guys. His serious, no-bulllshit demeanour makes him seem like he's much older, but his face is young. My guess is he could be anywhere between twenty and forty. He must feel me looking at him as his eyes flick up to mine over the paper and he holds my gaze. Everything in me screams at me to look away, to break the eye contact, but I don't. I won't be bullied by some stuck-up detective. His eyes grow intense and then I swear I see the flash of a smirk before he slams his hand down on the table, making me jump back in fright.

“Are you trying to challenge me Miss Banks?” he asks in a deeper voice than he'd used with the other officer.

“Challenge you?” I snort and raise an eyebrow, trying to use my attitude to mask how much he had scared me.

“I suggest you learn to submit, and quickly, because at the place you are going, the people won't be as tolerant as I am,” he says, closing the folder and putting it into his briefcase before turning to the officer and nodding. My heart pounds in my heart and panic grips me as I watch the two men shake hands. “I’ll take her from here,” the stuck-up detective tells the officer.

“No,” I manage to rasp out. “Please, I didn't mean to hurt her. I can't go to prison. I can't!… Don't I get a solicitor?… A phone call?” I plead with the officer as he leaves the room. I turn my attention back to the suited man. “Please sir, it was an accident,” I sob.

“Not so tough now are we?” he smirks at me. “Let's go, Miss Banks, I have a very busy schedule and don't have time for your tears,” he sighs and heads towards the door. I remain seated, frozen in fear and shock. “You have two seconds to follow me, otherwise I will leave you here and let the police throw you in prison,” he snaps.

“Wait, what?” I gasp and turn to look at him. He gestures to the open doorway he is standing in and without too much thought I scramble to my feet and rush to his side.

“That's what I thought,” I hear him remark under his breath. He walks down the corridor with large strides that I struggle to keep up with.

“Where are we going?” I whisper to him as we pass police officers who don't seem to pay any attention to us. He ignores me like the rude assh-ole that he is and doesn't even look at me until we reach the elevator. He presses the button and turns to face me whilst we wait for the doors to open.

“Tell me, Miss Banks, are you prone to panic attacks?” He asks

“Huh?” I respond, a little taken aback at this whole situation.

“Your file says you passed out from a suspected panic attack at the scene, and you seem to be on the brink of another panic attack now. So what I am asking, little girl, is if I’m going to have to hold your hand through our journey?” He snarks. Anger flares in me at his words.

“Well I’m sorry Mr Perfect, I’ve had a day so do excuse me if I’m a little upset!” I hiss at him, crossing my arms to let him know how much of a badass I am. He gives me another of his barely there smirks and a nod in what seems like approval. The elevator dings at that moment, the doors opening and he steps forward without another word. I follow the smarmy guy in and stand beside him. I watch as the doors close, with a strange sense that they're closing on my old life.

“Collins,” he says, snapping me out of my strange thoughts I turn to give him a questioning look. “It's Mr Collins,” he says in a barely there whisper as he steps dangerously close and looks down at me. So close that when I take a breath my heart touches his. The air suddenly feels charged as I stare up into Mr Collins’ eyes. The arm holding the briefcase snakes around my back and he pulls me flush against his heart, causing me to gasp. Holy sh-it balls this man is hot. He brings up his other hand and gently strokes my cheek with a secret smile, then in a flash he grips my chin hard. “Sleep,” he demands, his eyes flashing blue as he speaks. My last thought before my body shuts down is that I'm going to knee this jer-k in the balls as soon as I get the opportunity.

Chapter 3

“Wake up, Miss Banks,” a smooth voice says, the tone washes over me like a loving caress, and for the first time in a very long time I feel safe and it's not something I want to wake up from just yet. I nuzzle my face into the warmth against my cheek. A sweet, buttery and woodsy kind of scent hits my nose and I give an approving hum at the pleasing smell. A grunt of disapproval ruins my contentment right before I am dropped unceremoniously onto my back. The landing is soft but still unpleasant.

“What the he-ll!” I curse, rushing to sit and take in my surroundings. I'm on a couch in a dimly lit room, bright light suddenly floods the room making me squint against it. I shift my attention to the source of the light, fighting the urge to hiss at it like a feral vampire. A large figure is framed by the beaming sunlight that is flooding the room through a window that spans the entire wall. The figure is fussing with the curtains that he's just opened and I quickly recognise him as the stuck-up detective, Mr Collins. The events of the day come rushing back to me like a tidal wave of anger, fear and complete confusion.

“What did you do to me? How did we get here?” I demand, gesturing to the room and jumping to my feet.

“I don't have time to baby you through this, so here is the quick version,” he starts as he unbuttons his suit jacket and hangs it over the back of a large leather office chair. “My name is Deacon Collins, I am the headmaster of Grey’s Academy and you are the newest student here. Tell me, what do you know about your heritage?” he asks. My eyes are transfixed on his hands as he unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls up each sleeve to expose some impressive forearms. A throat clearing snaps me out of my trance.

“Oh… um,” I start, embarrassed at being caught staring. “Sorry, I'm a little lost here. I'm not feeling myself,” I say with a sigh and flop down onto the couch. I try to process what the he-ll is going on.

“Due to your circumstances, I am going to assume you know nothing. Here at Greys Academy, our students are gifted…” he begins.

“Wait, gifted?” I interrupt, “I think there's been a mistake. I'm not gifted, I got a pass in all my exams but nothing that makes me stand out,”

“If you'd let me finish Miss Banks…”

“Josie,” I correct, not liking the way he uses ‘Miss Banks’ in an inferior way.

“Miss Banks,” he reiterates, “If you would just keep quiet for two minutes and let me explain then you can be on your way. Our Academy is for what we call Greys. Greys are a race of superhumans. Whilst we are much more powerful than regular humans, we are also small in number. For this reason, we have created our own realm within the human one. This is safer for everyone to live in peace. Somehow, you have slipped through the net and grown up within the human realm. I will be launching a full investigation into how that came to pass, but for now, you are here and you are safe. Now I appreciate this is a lot for you to take in and you have a lot of catching up to do so I won't overwhelm you today. I will have my assistant assign you a dorm room and pair you with one of our more intellectual students to do extra studies with you outside of your regular lessons. I will also schedule some extra studies with our tutors here. Any questions?” he says without a flicker of a smile.

“Oh, you are good,” I laugh. “I love this show! I used to watch it all the time,” I say between bouts of laughter. I get up and start exploring the room to find the hidden cameras. I can't believe I'm on the prank show. I wonder who nominated me, it must have been Freya, my best friend from college. “Was it Freya that put you up to this?” I giggle.

“Miss Banks!” the actor playing Mr Collins shouts, slamming his hand down on the desk, which just makes me laugh harder. I approach him and examine the buttons on his shirt, one must be a hidden camera. Then I start rubbing my hands over his shirt, feeling for the hidden wires. In a flash his hands wrap around my wrists, making me gasp in shock as he grips them hard, stopping my exploration. I look up at him and his eyes are intense as they stare back at me. “What the he-ll are you doing?” he asks in an almost growl.

“Looking for your mic?” I gulp.

“I don't have a mic, this is not a prank. You are new here and you've had a lot to take in so this once I will give you a pass, but if you lay your hands on me ever again there will be punishment. Do you understand?” he says in a low, scary tone. His heavy breathing makes me bite my tongue because I really want to taunt him about what this punishment might be. As if he knows what I'm thinking his eyes seem to flash blue. That's when I remember them doing that earlier, right before he demanded that I sleep, a demand I was powerless to resist. Panic bubbles inside me at the realisation. He's telling the truth, isn't he?

“You made me go to sleep,” I say with a shaky breath. He gives me a single nod in response. “What else can you make me do?” I ask. Fear at how vulnerable I am right now pushes me to ask the question.

“Anything,” he says in a husky whisper, and I swear his face moves closer to mine. His answer doesn't scare me like it should, if anything it excites me. Then a door opens, breaking the trance he has me in, he drops my wrists and takes a step back as if I'm suddenly repulsive to him. I turn to see who the intruder is.

Chapter 4

“I thought I heard voices in here. Is everything okay Dee?” a very attractive woman who looks to be in her thirties says as she walks into the room with a beaming smile. Her hair is jet black and shines as the sunlight hits it. It's the sort of hair that should be in shampoo ads and just enhances her stunning blue eyes and flawless skin. She wears a skin-tight black dress that shows off her hourglass figure and black stilettos, with her finger and toenails painted bright red. She is the kind of woman that makes you feel insecure as soon as you see her.

“Yes. Clarrisa, this is Josie Banks, a new student I've just picked up from the human realm. Could you please assign her one of the single dorm rooms in Ruby,” Mr Collins says, whilst he takes out the file from his briefcase that the police officer had given him earlier and holds it out to Clarrisa.

“Are you sure? There's plenty of space for her in Amber or Saphire,” Clarrisa says, giving me an assessing look up and down before scrunching her nose a little.

“Put her in Ruby please and make sure she has everything she needs,” he says dismissively. Then he sits at his desk and opens up a laptop. I stand there unsure of what I’m supposed to do now. Mr Collins glances up at Clarrisa and then me. “That will be all,” he grunts.

“Of course Deacon, Josie follow me please,” Clarrisa smiles tightly.

“But…” I start.

“That will be all Miss Banks, Clarrisa will get you everything you need and someone will be along to your dorm shortly to answer all your questions and get you settled. Welcome to Greys Academy. I hope there will be no need for any more visits to my office,” Mr Collins says flatly and then turns his attention back to his laptop. With a sigh, I follow perfect Clarrisa.

We exit the office into a glass-lined corridor, Clarrisas heels click loudly on the cream marble floor. Everything feels too bright and shiny. I'd hate to be the cleaner here, there must be a whole army of cleaners to keep all the glass and marble clean. Clarrisa leads me to an elevator and I let an audible breath as I remember my last elevator ride before I was kidnapped by a hot, rude of a… wizard? Then I snort laugh as I think about what is happening. I'm in freaking Hogwarts, and that makes Mr Collins Professor Dumbledore. Clarrisa gives me a disapproving side-eye.

“Sorry, it's been a wild day,” I explain.

“I can imagine. Don't worry about Deacon, he was taking his morning shower when the call came in about you, he had to rush off without his morning coffee, he's grumpy without his coffee,” she laughs, a little too much for it to be real. My mind is suddenly filled with thoughts of Mr Collins in the shower, then I realise what she said. If she was there when he got the call, that means she was there when he was showering. She's his girlfriend… or wife. Of course, she is, she is beautiful and he is hot as he-ll, they are a perfect match. That explains why he jumped away from me like I was on fire, he didn't want his girlfriend to get the wrong idea. My heart sinks a little. I thought I'd felt some chemistry in our short encounter, but I guess it was a wro thought anyway. I'm his student now, and I don't know how things work here but I'm sure it's the same as it is in the human world. Students and teachers dating is a huge no. Why am I wasting time thinking about this when my life has just been completely obliterated?

“Wait!” I blurt. “I need to go back… my mum,” I manage to say through panicked breaths. How could I forget about my mum? Guilt floods me.

“Don't worry about any of that for now, time works differently here so no one will be missing you yet. Deacon will take care of everything, your mum will be just fine. I'm sure he will keep you updated on personal matters like that,” she smiles.

“Okay,” I nod. “What about my stuff? Can I go back for it?” I ask.

“Deacon will arrange for your belongings to get to you, try not to worry and just focus on making your new life here. I know this is a difficult time but I'm sure you will be happy here, we will work everything out to make this transition as easy as possible for you,” she says as we walk through a maze of glass and marble corridors. We exit the building into a courtyard with a huge fountain in the middle. The water comes out through four spouts. Above each spout is a large crystal. Clarrisa stops walking for a moment to let me look at it. “Each crystal represents a house at our Academy. You have been assigned to Ruby for the time being,” she motions to the red stone. “You can easily identify your fellow house students by the colour of their tie. Red for Ruby, green for Emerald, blue for Sapphire and yellow for Amber,” she explains as we walk on. I mentally roll my eyes at the thought of wearing a uniform again. I'm almost 19 years old and I feel like I'm going back to secondary school.

“Where are the other students?” I ask, taking note of how quiet it is.

“They are all in classes, they'll be finishing soon. We have just over 300 students here, it can get quite busy between classes,” she grimaces. Movement in the distance catches my eye and I can just make out a group of about thirty people. They're moving fast around each other as if dancing. As we get closer I realise they're fighting.

“Combat training,” Clarrisa comments, “they're our next squad of soldiers,” she adds proudly. I want to get a closer look but Clarrisa ushers me on and towards an old-looking stone building that's embellished with Rubies. “This is your building,” she says as we go through the door. I look around in awe. It's stunning. It's like an old castle inside but with everything you'd expect in a modern house. The large space has stone walls with thick red curtains around the huge windows. Then there are couches scattered around a large rug with a stone fireplace and real fire. There is a big flatscreen TV mounted to one of the walls with game consoles on the shelves underneath it. On each side of the room is a grand staircase that meets at the top. I follow Clarrisa up the stairs and down a hall, we pass two doors before she stops and hands me a key. “This one is yours, I'll give you some time to settle in and someone will be along shortly to show you around,” she smiles and walks away before I can even mutter a thank-you or get the door open.

I told him he could leave with nothing, but he refused.

In the end, we made a bet—a year-long one.

A year later, he broke down and screamed, ""You didn't stick to the agreement!""

I smiled at him and replied calmly, ""But wasn't it you who broke the agreement?""

Someone went through forty years without learning love and responsibility.

However, they would eventually pay the price for their greed and hypocrisy.

\*\*\*\*\*

After forty years together and twenty years of marriage, my husband Jerome cheated on me.

He finally came home after giving me the silent treatment for one month.

He sat across the coffee table, staring at me indifferently.

""Raquel, I assume you've had enough time to calm down,"" he said.

He went on, ""Raquel, we're both in our forties, old enough to think about this rationally.

""Now that you've found out, I have nothing left to hide.

""Winnie and I have been together for a year now. During this time, I've kept it hidden to spare your feelings.

""I know what we did was wrong. That's why this past year has been torture for me. I've been carrying this burden of guilt.

""I don't want to go on like this. I've already betrayed you and our son. I can't do the same to Winnie.

""So let's get a divorce.

""I'll transfer all cash and real estate to you and our son and only keep my company shares.

""After all these years together, let's end this without any drama.""

I thought he had come back to explain himself to me.

I thought he had come back to save our marriage.

I thought he had come back to beg for my forgiveness.

But never in my wildest dreams did I think he'd come back just to divorce me.

Twisting the silver wedding band I'd worn for over twenty years, I noticed its once-bright luster had long since faded.

Instead, it bore numerous scratches that told the story of time's passage.

I took off my wedding ring and flung it at Jerome. ""Take back what's yours.""

Jerome caught the object Raquel threw at him without realizing what it was. Only when it landed in his palm and he glanced down did he recognize it.

To his surprise, it was that worn-out silver ring.

He remembered this ring. It was the very one he'd given Raquel when he proposed to her.

Jerome didn't expect that she still kept it.

Somehow, a pang of guilt welled up in Jerome.

But at the thought of Winnie, that pang of guilt quickly faded.

""After all the beautiful diamond rings I've bought you, why would you still keep this worthless piece of junk?"" he asked.

Jerome casually tossed the ring into the trash bin near the coffee table.

He thought this worthless junk should never have existed in his home.

That wretched ring was a constant reminder of how destitute he used to be.

It also reminded him of how wretched he was back then.

I watched as Jerome tossed the wedding ring I had worn for over two decades straight into the trash.

I laughed at my devotion and stupidity. It was so foolish for me to still have hope in him after all this time.

I wonder why I was still clinging so desperately to these memories.

That worthless silver ring had shackled me for twenty long years.

Now that it was gone, I suppose it was finally time for me to let go.

The teenager who said he would love me and accompany me for the rest of my life gradually faded from my memory.

People really did change, didn't they?

So what if we were childhood sweethearts? What did twenty years of marriage even matter?

Nothing could ever compare to his precious darling.

This sudden epiphany almost felt like a blessing. I was only forty-two, still in the prime of my life.

At least I saw his true colors in time, and I still have the capital to cut my losses and start over.

But for no apparent reason, an inexplicable fury surged through me.

The divorce was happening, but I would be the one setting the terms.

Throughout all these years as a wealthy wife, I have maintained elegant manners.

However, turning the other cheek had never been my style.

I said, ""Jerome, I stood by you from scratch and endured every hardship imaginable with you, and together, we built this family fortune.

""And now you want to take the fortune we sweated blood to build and use it to marry some other woman?

""Let me make this crystal clear. I won't let any other woman reap the fruits of my life's work.

""Anyone who dares to take what's mine, I'll make sure she pays dearly for it.

""If you want to run off with your darling, then leave with nothing!""

Jerome sighed wearily, as if he'd expected this from me.

He said, ""Raquel, I'm sorry I cheated on you, and I understand you're angry.

""But I really don't love you anymore.

""Winnie is still young. There's no way I can just leave her with nothing.

""We've known each other for forty years and been married for twenty. We shared so many wonderful moments together.

""After all these years together, just grant me this wish.

""Let's part ways amicably.

""Please don't say such hurtful things anymore. It's damaging our bond. Even if we get divorced, I'll always consider you family.""

He claimed he didn't love me anymore, insisted on leaving assets for Winnie, kept reminiscing about how happy we used to be, and expected us to part amicably without any hard feelings.

He actually said that even after the divorce, I'd still be his family.

How touching, as if that made any difference.

Those once-familiar eyes now filled me with nothing but disgust.

I scoffed, ""Jerome, you've got some nerve. One is a young, pampered new lover, and the other is your wife, who's been through thick and thin with you for decades. Do you really think we can all just play happy family?

""You must be joking. That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.""

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh.

I must be the only one who could still laugh after being betrayed.

I laughed so hard under his awkward gaze before finally stopping.

Then I wiped the tears of bitter laughter from my eyes.

I snapped, ""You want a divorce? Fine. But you're walking out with nothing. Or forget it.""

I remained adamant, completely unmoved by his pathetic attempts at playing the victim.

Jerome agitatedly twirled the coffee cup in his hand before speaking up coldly.

He said, ""Raquel, I've always believed that we can still be family and friends even if we can't be husband and wife.

""We grew up together with forty years of shared history. Do you have to be this ruthless?""

Ruthless? I didn't think so. I spent twenty years standing by him through every hardship to help him build his business from scratch.

After all those years of hard work, I'd finally made it, and I was supposed to be enjoying a good life.

Now he was ready to run off and start a new life with that woman.

Why should I let some other woman just waltz in and enjoy the good life we built together without lifting a finger?

I was miserable, so why should he get to live happily ever after?

# Chapter 2

I stayed silent, and that was my answer.

Jerome suddenly slammed the coffee cup down onto the coffee table.

With a sharp crack, the coffee cup shattered into fragments upon impact.

It was just like our marriage now, broken beyond repair.

Jerome said angrily, ""Raquel, after all these years together, I never would have thought you could be this greedy.

""Half of our marital assets are legally mine, and I've already given you the lion's share. How can you still be so insatiable?

""Can't we just part ways amicably? Do you have to force us to turn against each other?""

I curled my lips into a mocking smile at his furious expression.

It was his betrayal that left me miserable and resentful, not the other way around.

My kindness was exploited, my trust trifled with, my affections betrayed, and my sincere heart ridiculed.

After all this, how dare he still expect a clean break?

""My decision is final,"" I said coldly. ""If you want a divorce, you leave with nothing. Otherwise, you won't like what comes next.""

After all his years as CEO, Jerome had rarely stooped to this level when speaking to anyone.

Raquel's relentless provocations finally pushed Jerome to his breaking point.

He said, ""Raquel, my guilt has its limits.

""Yes, I know you've endured every hardship with me. But half of our marital assets rightfully belong to me. There's no way I'll let you have it all.

""If we can't reach an agreement, we'll settle this in court. You should know you might end up with far less than this offer.

""I still hope you'll reconsider this carefully.""

I poured myself a cup of coffee and took a sip. It was bitter, much like the reality I'm facing right now.

I looked up at him and said, ""Oh? So now our decades of shared history don't matter anymore?""

Then I sneered.

I continued, ""Jerome, go ask a lawyer. If I don't agree, do you think the court would grant the divorce without my consent?

""If this divorce lawsuit drags on for decades, we'll both be dead and buried.

""So your precious little darling will just wail. She'll always be the mistress, even to her grave.""

Jerome was fuming. Why couldn't I get through to her? If she insisted on being this stubborn, she would have no one to blame but herself for what happened next.

He said, ""If you don't agree, fine. I'm moving out today. I'll file for divorce in two years, and I can still get a divorce by then.

""I can also make her my lawful wife. And you? Forget about getting anywhere near that much of the assets.""

With that, he grabbed his suitcase and headed to the bedroom.

Ten minutes later, he emerged, dragging a heavy suitcase.

Without even glancing at me, he strode straight for the door.

After betraying me, he still thought he could control me? Fine, let's see who could win at last.

I said slowly, ""It seems an inclusive society now. Who knows? Maybe even more people would actually support her being the other woman?""

At that, Jerome froze in the doorway. He whirled around, glaring at me with burning intensity. ""What the hell are you trying to pull?""

I took another slow sip of my coffee. It was bitter at first but with a lingering sweetness.

""What can I do? Netizens these days are so tolerant. They might even start shipping you two, rooting for your little star-crossed romance—""

Before I could finish my sentence, I heard Jerome roar furiously, ""Don't you dare!""

His fingers turned white from gripping the suitcase, and veins throbbed visibly at his temples.

All his previous composure vanished, replaced by visible panic.

I never expected him to be this protective of another woman.

Seeing him like that, I couldn't help but laugh mockingly.

In negotiations, nothing was more dangerous than letting the other party exploit weaknesses.

I said, ""I dare. You know damn well there's nothing I wouldn't do.""

I was elegant, generous, modest, and sensible.

But I sought revenge for the smallest grievance. Jerome knew that better than anyone.

Back in the early days of building our business, Jerome and I were constantly out dining with clients.

Being young and attractive, I inevitably faced unwanted advances at those business dinners.

I'd always just cling to Jerome and endure it in silence.

But once Jerome and I became successful, those who had once harassed me faced various consequences. Some had their families broken up. Others were engulfed in scandals, and a few even went bankrupt.

Jerome knew it was my doing, and he even helped me cover my tracks.

So he knew I was not bluffing.

I supposed this explained why he was stooping to negotiate the divorce terms himself.

I thought he was afraid that I would deal with him and his precious darling just as ruthlessly as I did with those others.

But in doing so, I found his Achilles' heel.

Jerome remained silent and stared at me with cold eyes.

Unfazed, I stared back at him defiantly.

I said, ""If you insist on taking the shares, the company could go under. You know I can make that happen.

""Not only that, I'll sue you and your precious darling to reclaim every cent of our marital assets.

""Besides, I might even file a bigamy lawsuit against you. Who knows? I might just win—""

Before I could finish, Jerome stormed over, glaring at me from across the coffee table. His eyes were blazing with fury.

I ignored him, sipping my coffee leisurely. It even tasted better and better.

Jerome knew all too well that Raquel really had the means to pull it off, and that was exactly why he didn't dare make a move against her.

Defeated, he relented and softened his tone.

He said, ""Raquel, we grew up together as childhood sweethearts. There's a bond between us that goes all the way back.

""We've known each other for forty years. Tell me honestly. Haven't I always treated you well?

""Even though I don't love you now, I still consider you family. Can't you just grant me this?

""That's the company we built together through blood, sweat, and tears. How could you even think of destroying it?""

He might have sounded sincere, but honestly, I just found it laughable.

Just to divorce me and legitimize his precious mistress, Jerome has tried every dirty trick in the book.

I said, ""Jerome, stop lying to yourself. What bond could possibly remain between us now?""

""Of course, I would destroy it. You know I never let a grudge go unavenged. I won't let a single cent go to those who've harmed me.""

Jerome was shaking violently. His fury was clearly at its peak. ""Raquel, I never thought you'd turn out to be such a crazy woman!""

He stormed out, slamming the door behind him, and this time, he was gone for another whole month.

# Chapter 3

For that entire month, I did just one thing. I hired a lawyer to sue him and his precious darling.

No one could betray me and get away with it.

Then he came crawling back.

What true love indeed.

Jerome exclaimed, ""Raquel, you actually sued me and Winnie!""

Seeing the fury on his face gave me a deep sense of satisfaction.

I said, ""So, all your assets got frozen?

""You've received the court summons, have you? Then you'd better tell your precious little darling to get her finances in order. Otherwise, if she can't cough up the money when the time comes, she'll end up on the defaulters' list.

""Also, since we're still married, I'd advise you to stop giving her any more money. Lately, I've received quite a few anonymous tips with photographic evidence. It's more than enough to build a solid bigamy case against you.

""Don't worry. Given our decades-long history, I'm not planning to do that for now.

""But I have no connection with Winnie. I'll sue her at any moment to reclaim every penny of our marital assets.

""What's more, stop all your underhanded dealings at the company.

""I'll let it slide this month. But if I catch you pulling any more tricks, I won't hesitate to call a board meeting and expose your true colors. The board will surely consider replacing the CEO.""

Jerome shuddered, a sudden wave of dread washing over him.

He realized that Raquel had been tracking his every move.

Lately, he had had this creeping feeling of being watched. Now it hit him that Raquel must have people tailing him.

He had been living under her close surveillance all this time.

After decades together, he knew Raquel's methods all too well. She had personally settled scores with every single person who'd ever crossed her.

Back then, he took pride in having such a formidable wife. Now, all he felt was sheer terror.

The reason he offered Raquel the lion's share of their assets in the divorce was not without cause.

He knew all too well how ruthless she could be, and he was terrified she'd go nuclear.

He'd envisioned a clean break with her.

But his negotiations broke down completely.

He knew he owed Raquel.

He had truly loved her once.

But after all these decades, his feelings for her were gone.

He knew just how formidable Raquel could be. At first, divorce wasn't even on his mind. He only wanted to keep Winnie outside the marriage.

He never expected to get caught.

He remembered that day when Winnie was slapped by Raquel and didn't dare fight back.

At that moment, a wave of guilt washed over him for Winnie.

He wanted to give her a proper status.

He didn't want Winnie to be the other woman anymore.

He didn't want her to be slapped again.

He made the decision to divorce after careful consideration.

He was certain that even if they got divorced, Raquel wouldn't just cast aside decades of affection, as they had grown up together.

But he was mistaken. Raquel didn't even show a trace of sentiment.

Given her vengeful nature, he should have known that Raquel would never let him off easily.

He pictured Raquel making a scene.

He imagined his own social ruin.

He thought of his son.

He remembered his aging parents.

A deep sense of helplessness settled over him.

He didn't understand why it was so hard to be with the one he loved.

He let out a long breath and finally made up his mind.

As long as Raquel stopped making trouble and let him and Winnie live in peace, he'd accept it.

After all, even without his shares, he was still the CEO with a salary high enough for him and Winnie to live on.

He said, ""Raquel, I've told you that you're family to me. So I'll give you what you want. If you drop the lawsuit, I'll walk away with nothing but the clothes on my back.""

Seeing him so defeated and compromised, I felt utterly lost inside.

Suddenly, I remembered the young Jerome who shielded me during the car accident.

Back then, he was covered in blood. His trembling hand cupped my face. His voice was broken and shaky.

He said, ""Raquel, it doesn't hurt. Don't... cry. It breaks my heart to see you cry.

""Don't worry. I won't... die. If you don't believe me... let's make a bet.""

He coughed up a mouthful of blood. It was shockingly red.

He said, ""I bet I won't die.

""If I live, you marry me. If I die, you walk away.""

The face from my memory slowly overlapped with Jerome standing before me now.

""Raquel, for the sake of all the years we grew up together, can't you just let this go?"" Jerome pleaded.

His voice snapped me back. I looked at him, feeling upset.

""Jerome, let's make a bet,"" I said quietly.

Jerome froze, clearly not expecting Raquel to bring up a bet at a time like this.

It brought back memories of all those times he spent with Raquel.

He felt like changing his mind, but when he thought of Winnie, he quickly suppressed it.

""How do you want to bet?"" I asked.

I looked at him seriously, and he met my gaze, just as earnest as me.

It was just like the way we used to bet.

""I bet she doesn't really love you. She's only after your money,"" I declared.

As soon as I finished, Jerome's face darkened.

After a beat, he responded, ""She's not like that.""

I could tell he was annoyed, as if I had slandered their perfect love, but I still pressed on.

""I bet when you're broke, she'll dump you and go find herself a new rich guy,"" I said.

Jerome snapped, ""Impossible!""

""I'll bet you on this unless you're too chicken to take the wager,"" I urged.

Jerome retorted, ""Why wouldn't I? Winnie isn't such a shallow woman.""

I said, ""Fine, let's make this bet. First, I reclaim all our marital assets, and you leave with nothing, not even a single share of the company.

""If your sweetheart sticks with you through thick and thin for a whole year at your lowest, you win the bet.

""Then I'll return all your company shares and split the rest of our marital assets fifty-fifty.

""At that point, you can give everything to your precious darling. I won't object in the slightest.

""And I'll even persuade our son to accept Winnie and give you both his blessings.

""I'll also talk to your parents and make sure they won't get angry with you.""

Jerome stared at Raquel in shock. His mind was in turmoil.

Her aggressive attitude just now reminded him exactly of the times she used to challenge him to bet in the past.

He clearly had no intention of taking the bet, yet at that very moment, as if possessed, he found himself nodding.

He said, ""Alright, you're on.""

Seeing him agree so decisively, I was momentarily dazed.

Countless images overlapped in my mind.

As a boy, as a teenager, and as a man after college, he was always so unwavering.

I said, ""Don't you even want to know what's at stake if you lose?""

""I won't lose!"" Jerome said with conviction, completely confident in his own judgment.

He declared, ""If I lose, I'll accept whatever terms you set.

""But we absolutely have to sign a separate agreement.""

Confident of victory, he still wanted something in writing to prevent Raquel from going back on her word.

I shook my head. ""Jerome, we've been making bets for decades. When have we ever needed a written contract?""

Jerome said irritably, ""How do I know you won't go back on your word?""

I looked at him calmly.

I said, ""Jerome, you begged me for this divorce.

""I'm only making this bet because of all we've been through these years. Take it or leave it. It makes no difference to me.

""You know I always honor my bets. When have I ever reneged?""

1m2vbok,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m2vbok/renting_storage_unit_worried_about_bugs_need/,"Renting storage unit, worried about bugs, need advice","Hello Reddit. I am renting a storage unit for a month because I will be out of town in another country when my lease is up. When I return to the U.S., I’m going to move everything from storage, into my new place. 

I’m on here because I’m worried about bugs destroying my stuff. The storage unit is an “outdoor”one. It didn’t smell or anything and I didn’t see roaches or ants but there were some spiders and it is very hot where I live this time of year. 

I am storing a couple of coffee tables, and large mirror, clothes, sheet music (scores), shoes, plastic filing cabinets, and possibly some dry food goods.

I don’t want to bring the dried goods to the unit, but I have like 8 bags of pasta, a couple bags or rice, a couple bags of dried beans, and many canned goods that I really don’t want to throw out. I was thinking I’ll wipe everything off on the outside with wipes and once they’re dry, put them in gallon sized ziplocks (still sealed in their own packages too) and then all into one of the smaller bins I have and try to stack it toward the top in the storage.

I was also thinking of spraying the perimeter of the unit (on the inside) with water with a few drops of peppermint oil to deter pests. But I don’t want to get in trouble with the storage unit if I’m not allowed to. And I’m too nervous to ask. 

I’m also a bit worried about pests getting to my clothes. I just don’t have enough plastic bags to completely seal them. They’re going in luggage, bins, backpacks, and trash bags. 

What do you guys think?  I really don’t want to spend any more money in this process. The unit was $70. It was initially $50 because I only bought one lock. And then when I got to the unit I found out it had 2 doors so I ended up buying another lock :(. They apologized tho for the mixup. ",2,1752821433.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1m2varj,https://www.reddit.com/r/12keys/comments/1m2varj/please_critique_my_new_orleans_solution_lake/,Please Critique my New Orleans Solution - Lake Shore - Harlequin Park,"It's been a while since I looked at this.  I posted on Facebook (maybe last year?) but was deleted because I didn't post under an identifiable profile. I'll try to regurgitate an ""interpretive summary"" from memory.  I recall having to resize and reposition the full image over a map a few times, per the interpreted instructions, so please bear with me.

At the place where jewels abound --> Lake Shore neighborhood (the one with the jewel street names - Using google earth, one is able to confirm this bias by importing the image, reduce opacity to < 50%, then overlay, resize, skew as necessary, and orient the image of the mask to align with the eyes of the neighborhood.  The pajama sleeve cuff should align with the freeway interchange, the mask stick is Canal Blvd, ending at the taper at the train tracks.  The heraldry wolf's head hovers a canine-related space.

Fifteen rows down to the ground --> Using the aligned image, count downward 15 heraldry chequy squares from the top left of the image to the base of the clock face.  One should be aligned with what was formerly named ""Robert E Lee Blvd"", using confirmation bias that the terms ""dregs"", ""coffee grounds"", and ""lees"" are synonymous.  I recall coffee and wine dregs being trigger terms used in the lore.

In the middle of twenty-one --> To the east of Lake Shore is the neighborhood named Lake Vista.  In the center is St. Pius X.  The parks and green spaces form an X and I, hence, X + X + I = 21.  For confirmation bias, the circle drives in Lake Vista resemble the shape of the second hand (if that's what that is in the image).

From end to end --> For confirmation bias, one should relocate the image, resize, orient, and skew as necessary to align the bottom circles of the clock hands with the circle drives of Spanish Fort Drive in the center, so that the hands stretch up to the end of Ozone Park.  Zephyr Park (named after a demolished roller coaster in this area) is the park in the upper right arm of the ""parks forming an X"".  Zephyrus is the Greek west winds god, such as how the harlequin-patterned-knickers-wearin' caddy is portrayed, facing west, hovering over Bayou Oaks North Course, and floating in an allusive wind god form (perhaps a bit more like Boreas).  I wonder if this caddy ever carried a set of vintage Spaulding Zephyr Kro-Flite clubs, following his employer as the crow flies, or the shortest distance between two points. 

Only three stand watch --> If the image is sized and positioned correctly, the clock's Roman numeral III (three) should be over the ruins of Fort St. John.

As the sound of friends --> Streets in Lake Vista are named after birds and flowers.

Fills the afternoon hours --> Technically, I suppose it could also fill the very early morning hours since a broken clock is correct twice per day.

Here is a sovereign people +

Who build palaces to shelter +

Their heads for a night!  -->  Yes, a line from a book.  But also, at this location (Lake Vista) in history, LaGarde Army/Navy Hospital was built during WWII as an ""exempt station"", an official description exempting them from the larger Army Base and able to act independently (as a sovereign people might) to care for overflowing war-wounded.  The terms ""hospital"", ""hospice"", ""hostel"", ""hotel"" share a common etymology.

Gnomes admire --> One definition for ""gnome"" is a concise maxim, a simple set of rules.  Certainly the allusions of St. Pius X's writings and catechism fit.  The etymon for ""admire"" is the same for ""admiralty"", the symbol of which is an anchor.  One of these exists atop the hands of the clock.  If one now resizes and refits the image so that the anchor is now aligned with Spanish Fort Drive circles outside of St. Pius X, the gem above the clock face should fit snugly into the rounded curve of Lakeshore Drive, covering the park shelter.  The resized image is now set for what I believe is the final step.

Fays delight --> If sounded out homophonous, as in ""phased alight"", it seems we are instructed to descend the clock's moon, depicted in full phase, or alight it in a series of steps.  Interpreting this bit would seem to be the key to finding the final (in my opinion) 5π / 2 square feet circumference.

The namesakes meeting --> After swiveling the image clockwise using the clock's gem as the axis so that the moon crosses over the water/land boundary and fulfills the allusion of setting, one might observe the placement of the second hand (or whatever it is) landing back at the northeast corner area of Harlequin Park in the bejeweled Lake Shore neighborhood...

Near this site.  --> ... also originally an eye of the mask, through which one is given sight.  Not sure if an eye closer to the bridge of one's nose is related to near-sightedness, but it's still sight all the same, and aptly within a neighborhood of streets named after the things these creatures love most.

Some of my postscript thoughts --> Yes, this area has been named lots of times, but has there ever been a complete solution offered that was laid out here from start to finish with such visible and tangible confirmation bias checkpoints?  Yes, google earth wasn't a thing when Preiss was masterminding and digging holes in construction-worker disguises, but maps and copy machines with the ability to reduce sizes were available.  So was eyeballing a map and comparing it to an image while using one's imagination.  I should know, I was an adult and alive back then to have worked on this puzzle.  Yes, the park has electrical and sewage lines all over the place, and will require at the very least a GPR survey to help compel/inspire permission to dig in a private park.  So be it.  This is where the clues took me, it's worth a GPR peek if the objective is to finally solve it.",2,1752821334.0,12keys,0,1.0,False

Then Rewan walks in. Hoodie half-on, hair a mess, eyes still half-closed. Clearly just here for coffee… until he clocks me standing by the stove.

And instead of going around me like a normal person, this man walks up behind me, folds his arms on top of my head, and rests his chin there.

Like I’m his personal leaning post 😭😭

He doesn’t even say good morning. Just mumbles, all soft and raspy:

“What are you making?”

And I freeze. Because—HELLO??? Sir??? Why are you warm, tall, and doing that thing with your voice 😩 How am I supposed to function like this?

Before I can even answer, he’s already reaching around me to take over cooking like it’s his kitchen now. So I’m just there, literally sandwiched between him and the stove. Not complaining, but mildly short-circuiting.

I turn around to look up at him and go, “Mei would love to see us looking this close.”

He smirks down at me, eyes glinting.
“Like your couple can talk.”

SIR???

I shove him—lightly—and squeeze out from under his arms, making my escape to start setting the table. Meanwhile, he’s still hovering behind me, muttering like, “Why are you making so much food…”

Then I hit a snag: the mugs are on the top shelf.

“Rewan, a little help?”

And this man—IDK what’s gotten into him—he turns and comes over again, but instead of just grabbing the mugs like a normal human being, he crowds in behind me, stretches his arm over my head like this is a damn romcom, and then… puts the cup on top of my head.

I just blink at him, baffled.
“Seriously? What is wrong with you? Why are you like this?”

He just grins, infuriatingly smug. I reach up to grab the mug—and of course, his hand is still on it. Our fingers brush, and without missing a beat, he says:

“There you go again with the hand-holding.”

My brain stalls. I squint at him, trying to stay grounded.

He shrugs, all casual arrogance.
“What, you don’t like it?”

Then he leans in a bit closer, head tilted, eyes sharp with mischief.

“You seemed pretty eager to hold my hand last night. Lied just for an excuse, didn’t you?”

I freeze for a second, caught off guard.
“Wow. Throwing it back in my face already?” I raise an eyebrow. “Bold move for someone who was weirdly reluctant to let go.”

He chuckles, stepping in even closer like he owns the floor between us.

“Sure. But you were the one clinging like your life depended on it.”

And I just—stand there. Stunned. Spirit temporarily exits body. Because first of all: RUDE. Second: TRUE. Third: HOW DARE HE SAY IT OUT LOUD 😩

Before I can formulate a response worthy of the sheer audacity,he takes the mug from my hand, sets it aside, and then—

Lifts me. Just scoops me up like I weigh nothing and plants me on the counter. Hands on either side of my thighs. So close I can smell his cologne. Shampoo. Aftershave. Maybe even his soul. I am not okay.

Then this cocky menace grins again and goes,
“What? Cat got your tongue? I thought you’d be throwing third-degree sass by now.”

I narrow my eyes. “So what, were you testing how close you could get before I snap?”

He doesn’t budge. Just leans in more, his smirk practically breathing the same air as me.

“Nah. I know you’re enjoying this too.” His gaze drops briefly to my lips. “Bet you’d love it if I stole you from your bae.”

And suddenly I’m a buffering screen. No thoughts, just blank.

But before he can say anything else, the smell of burning hits us.

He curses under his breath, spins around, and rushes to save the breakfast. I’m still perched on the counter, legs swinging like a malfunctioning Sim.

He plates the food, sets it on the table, then helps me down—hands lingering a bit too long—and just… sits across from me. Watching me, clearly proud of himself.

Like why are you still here?? I'm gonna get indigestion at this rate

To recover some semblance of control because at this point I’ve lost all of it, I scoop up a bit of food and offer it to him. Half-joking, half-daring him to keep the chaos going.

He doesn’t even blink. Just leans in and takes the bite straight off the spoon, chewing slow while staring me down like I’m the one who’s edible.

I blink. Mistake. Because next thing I know—he stands up.

And I feel it before I see it—the way the air shifts, how his body heat moves closer. And suddenly he’s in front of me again, stepping into my space like it’s his birthright.

No warning. No reason. Just vibes and menace.

He leans down, slower this time. Purposeful. Intense. Like he’s building suspense just to see if I break.

And I am breaking.

He’s way too close again—like, inhaling my oxygen close. One arm braces on the table beside me, the other reaches up and gently tucks my hair behind my ear.

Sir???

I think I stop breathing. My eyes are spinning. Brain short-circuiting. He’s just there, hovering, like he’s about to—

He dips his head, lips brushing dangerously close to my ear, and says, low and casual: ""That’s three kisses you owe me now.""

Then he straightens up, walks away like he didn’t just nearly end me on the spot.

I wouldn’t have to owe you anything had you stopped holding back 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨

Right on cue, Keziah walks in looking like she just saw the second coming.

“Why are you two eating together? Since when were y’all even close?”

And I’m like,
“Yeah… I’m just as lost as you.”

Then Rewan turns back from the doorway, smirking:
“Last night was fun.”

Instant flashback to our little flirty moment in the living room and—
Yeah.

I don’t send hate to anyone he’s rumored with or think I’m gonna meet him at a coffee shop or something. But part of me still lowkey thinks, “What if one day I actually date him?”
I know it’s not realistic. I know he’s a literal global celebrity, and there are millions of women who would want him. I also know I wouldn’t actually like the lifestyle of dating someone like him—he smokes, he’s super famous, no privacy, etc.
But a part of me still holds onto the thought, because it makes me feel special for a second.
It’s not like I’m obsessed 24/7—I still get real life crushes and I don’t think about him when I’m out living life. It’s just those random quiet moments where the delulu thoughts pop back in.
I used to be way worse, like back in June when tarot and astrology TikToks had me fully spiraling and thinking it was “fated.” Now I’m at least aware of how crazy that sounds, but sometimes I still don’t want to let it go completely.
Maybe it’s because the daydream feels safer than real life.
I know I’ll get over it eventually, but this is just where I’m at right now.

The sex was good—it always was.



But as Nathan Harrison rolled off her and reached for his cigarettes, Amelia knew something was coming.



She could feel it in the way he wouldn't look at her, in the tension radiating from his shoulders.



""We need to get divorced.""



Just like that. No buildup, no explanation. Like he was asking her to pass the salt.



Amelia was still trying to catch her breath, her skin flushed and damp. She turned toward him, confused. ""What?""



Nathan lit his cigarette, the flame briefly illuminating his sharp features before darkness settled between them again. ""She's got stomach cancer. Six months, maybe less.""



She. Always she. Never a name, like saying it out loud would make it too real.



""Dying as my wife—that's all she wants."" He took a long drag, exhaling slowly. ""It would mean everything to her.""



The bedroom went quiet except for the distant hum of traffic from the city below. Their shadows stretched across the wall from the bedside lamp, and Amelia stared at them—two people who should be close but felt like strangers.



""It's not permanent,"" Nathan continued when she didn't respond. ""Just until... you know. Then we'll get back together.""



""Amelia, she's dying.""



His voice was so calm, so reasonable. Like he was discussing weekend plans instead of asking her to give up her marriage.



Amelia studied his profile—the same face she'd been in love with since she was seventeen. God, had it really been seven years? Seven years of following him around like a lost puppy, taking whatever scraps of attention he threw her way.



She remembered the night that started it all. Rain pouring down, her stepfather's fist connecting with her ribs for the third time that week. Then Nathan appeared out of nowhere, soaking wet, gripping a broken piece of fence like a weapon.



""Back off!"" he'd shouted, stepping between them. ""You touch her again, I swear to God—""



He'd saved her that night. Seventeen-year-old Amelia had fallen so hard she never got back up.



For seven years, she'd done everything he asked. Followed him to college, changed her major to match his interests, even turned down job offers in other cities just to stay close. And every time she succeeded, every time she made him proud, he'd ruffle her hair and say, ""Good job, Mia.""



It was never enough, but she'd convinced herself it was just how he showed love. Quiet. Reserved. Even when people called her pathetic for chasing him, she didn't care. He was Nathan Harrison, and somehow, impossibly, he'd chosen her.



When his grandfather got sick last year and the family decided a wedding might bring good luck, Nathan had asked her almost casually: ""Want to make it official?"" She'd thought all those years of waiting had finally paid off.



But marriage hadn't changed anything. If anything, he seemed more distant than ever.



""Are you even listening to me?"" Nathan's voice cut through her thoughts, sharp with irritation.



""Yeah, I'm listening."" Amelia sat up, pulling the sheet around herself. ""You want to divorce me so you can marry your dying girlfriend.""



""She's not my girlfriend."" The words came out too quick, too defensive. ""Look, she's going through hell, okay? And she's never tried to break us up or anything. She could've easily made a move, but she didn't because she respects our marriage.""



Amelia almost laughed. Respects our marriage. Right.



""Every time I try to help her, she says no because she doesn't want to hurt you."" Nathan's voice took on that self-righteous tone she'd grown to hate. ""She's a good person, Mia. She doesn't deserve to die alone.""



""And what about me?"" The question slipped out before she could stop it.



Nathan's jaw tightened. For a moment, he looked almost annoyed that she'd asked. ""She's dying, Amelia.""



""I get that, but—""



""She loves me, okay?"" The admission hung in the air between them. ""And yeah, maybe I have feelings for her too. But we've never done anything about it because of you. We've never even kissed.""



Because of me. Like she was some obstacle they'd heroically overcome.



""She's kind and selfless, and she's running out of time."" Nathan's voice went cold. ""Don't make me think you're the kind of person who'd deny a dying woman her last wish.""



There it was. The trap, perfectly set. Be the good wife and step aside, or be the heartless bitch who wouldn't let a cancer patient die happy.



Amelia looked at him—really looked at him. When had he become this stranger? When had the boy who'd saved her turned into someone who could ask her to break her own heart and call it kindness?



She knew exactly when. The day Vivian Hope walked into their lives.



""You're sure about this?"" she asked quietly. ""The divorce?""



Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line. He stared at the wall, not meeting her eyes. ""Yeah. Look, you—""



""Okay.""



The word stopped him mid-sentence. His head snapped toward her, eyes narrowing like he was trying to figure out her angle.



""Just like that?""



""Just like that.""



Something flickered across his face—surprise, maybe suspicion. ""You're up to something.""



""I'm not up to anything, Nathan.""



""Bullshit. You're playing some game, trying to guilt me or—""



""I said okay."" Amelia's voice was steady, almost eerily calm. ""What else do you want?""



Nathan studied her for a long moment, then stubbed out his cigarette harder than necessary. ""Fine. Whatever."" He grabbed his clothes from the floor, pulling them on with sharp, angry movements. ""I'll have my lawyer draw up the papers.""



He headed for the door without another word, like her feelings didn't matter at all. Like asking your wife to divorce you so you could marry someone else was just another Tuesday night conversation.



The door slammed behind him, leaving Amelia alone in the sudden quiet.



Her phone buzzed against the nightstand. A text from a contact she'd labeled ""Vivian's Fake Account.""



He stopped by again tonight. ?



Attached was a photo taken through a glass door—Nathan's reflection, smiling in a way Amelia had never seen. Soft. Tender. Like he was looking at something precious.



She scrolled up through months of messages:



He told me he's falling for me.



Rainy night but I'm not cold. He's keeping me warm. ☔❤️



The real mistress is the one who isn't loved, Amelia. You're just his convenient wife for the family. I'm the one in his heart.



Message after message, each one a small knife twisting deeper. Proof of every suspicion she'd tried to ignore.



She'd never seen Nathan look the way he did in these photos. Never heard his voice go soft like it apparently did when he talked to Vivian. With Amelia, he was always controlled, distant. With Vivian, he was alive.



The first message was from eight months ago: You know who this is. Did you like the flowers I sent for your living room? Nathan said they were perfect.



Vivian Hope. Instagram darling, Manhattan's go-to floral designer for the wealthy elite. Amelia had shown Nathan these messages before, but he'd dismissed them.



""Could be anyone,"" he'd said. ""Where's your proof it's actually her? You probably sent these to yourself.""



Most of the photos were generic—shots anyone could take from outside a building or across a restaurant. But tonight's was different. Clear. Undeniable.



Would it matter? Would showing him change anything?



Amelia set the phone aside and opened the bottom drawer of her nightstand. Hidden under old magazines was a manila folder containing the pregnancy test she'd taken that morning.



Positive.



She was carrying Nathan's baby, and he wanted to divorce her to marry another woman.



Her tears hit the paper, smearing the medical print. She picked up Nathan's lighter from the ashtray and held the flame to the corner of the document, watching it curl and burn.



He'd never know. This divorce would be the last favor she'd ever do for him.



Seven years. Seven years of her life spent loving someone who'd never really loved her back.



But she was done now. Done chasing, done hoping, done being grateful for scraps.



Nathan Harrison had saved her once when she was seventeen and broken. Now, at twenty-four, she was going to save herself.



Chapter 2



Nathan drummed his fingers against the steering wheel of his Maybach, parked outside the Manhattan Family Court. His phone lit up with an incoming call.



""Nathan, sweetheart!"" His grandmother's voice was bright but pointed. ""You and Amelia have been married a whole year. When am I getting some great-grandbabies?""



Nathan's face softened despite himself. ""Grandma, we're still figuring things out. No need to rush."" He shifted in his seat. ""How's Grandpa doing? Is he—""



""Oh, don't you try to change the subject on me,"" she interrupted with a laugh. ""Your grandfather's doing much better, thank the Lord, but honey, we're not spring chickens anymore. We want to see those babies before we're too old to spoil them rotten.""



""Grandma...""



Her tone turned serious. ""And Nathan? I've been hearing things around town. Gossip. You better be treating that sweet girl right, you hear me?""



Nathan went silent for a beat too long.



""Nathan James Harrison, are you listening to me?""



He rubbed his temples. ""Yeah, Grandma. I hear you loud and clear.""



After another few minutes of her gentle but persistent questioning, Nathan finally managed to end the call. He stared at the courthouse entrance, his jaw working.



He pulled up his messages, thumb hovering over Vivian's contact—the heart emoji next to her name, the photo of her laughing in golden sunlight. He scrolled past it and tapped Amelia's name instead. Their last exchange was just logistics: time, place, what to bring.



She was ten minutes late. Not like her at all.



Where are you?



A tap on his window made him look up. Amelia stood there looking washed out, dark circles under her eyes. She slid into the passenger seat without a word.



She was wearing the same clothes from yesterday—a cream blazer and black pants she'd bought for him last month. ""You look good in earth tones,"" she'd said, holding the jacket up to his chest.



For seven years, she'd dressed him, fed him, organized his entire life down to his dentist appointments.



""You're late,"" he said.



""By ten minutes."" Her voice was flat. No apology, no excuse. The old Amelia would've shown up an hour early with coffee and an explanation for every minute of delay.



Nathan's drumming stopped. He studied her profile—pale, distant, like she wasn't really there.



""My grandmother just called."" He looked straight ahead. ""We can't tell them about any of this. The divorce, I mean. It would kill them.""



Amelia didn't nod or agree like she usually did. Instead: ""What did she say?""



""Wants grandkids. The usual."" Nathan's voice tightened with irritation. ""She's been hearing rumors about us.""



The silence stretched between them. After what felt like forever, Amelia let out a short, bitter laugh.



Nathan's hands clenched. He kept his eyes on the courthouse steps, watching couples come and go.



He'd thought about kids before. Late at night, after sex, he'd sometimes trace circles on Amelia's stomach and murmur, ""Maybe we should start trying soon."" It was always someday, eventually, when things settled down.



But Vivian only had six months. After that, everything would go back to normal. There'd be plenty of time for babies then.



""Last chance to back out,"" Amelia said quietly. ""Do you really want to do this?""



""Are you kidding me right now?"" The anger in his voice was sharp, real. ""Vivian's at home waiting for an answer. Don't start playing games.""



Instead of responding, Amelia pulled out a thick manila envelope and handed it to him.



Nathan frowned as he opened it. Property division agreement. Legal letterhead, official seals, the works.



""Since we're doing this, we might as well do it right,"" she said, her tone businesslike. ""I'm only taking what's legally mine. Everything else stays with your family.""



She placed a pen on the center console. ""The cooling-off period starts once we sign. Whatever money we make during the separation belongs to each of us individually.""



Nathan scanned the document. It was thorough, professional, and surprisingly generous to him. Her signature was already there in careful script.



""What's this about?"" He looked up at her. ""It's just temporary. Six months, then we're back to normal.""



""Maybe. Maybe not.""



Something cold settled in his stomach. ""What's that supposed to mean?""



""Just sign it, Nathan.""



He studied her face, looking for the crack, the tell that would reveal her angle. Amelia always had an angle—some way to make him feel guilty or sorry for her. She'd tried it before with those fake messages she claimed were from Vivian.



But her expression was unreadable.



Fine. Let her play whatever game this is.



Nathan grabbed the pen and signed with sharp, aggressive strokes. No one manipulated him. Not anymore.



Two copies. Amelia folded hers neatly and slipped it into her purse.



The actual filing was bureaucratic and cold. Take a number, submit paperwork, fill out forms. The clerk explained the thirty-day waiting period with the enthusiasm of someone reading a grocery list. They each got a receipt with a return date circled in red ink.



Outside, the September sun was surprisingly warm. Nathan watched a young couple emerge from the building, both grinning, the woman showing off her ring to anyone who'd look.



He remembered Amelia doing the same thing a year ago. Practically glowing as she called her friends to share the news.



Now she stood beside him like she was waiting for a bus.



""I'll keep your account funded during the separation,"" he said, not looking at her. ""And remember what I said about my grandparents.""



He started walking toward his car, then stopped. ""Amelia.""



She looked at him, eyebrows raised.



""This is temporary. You get that, right?""



""Sure, Nathan.""



Something about the way she said it bothered him, but Vivian was waiting. He got in his car and drove away without looking back.



Amelia watched his Maybach disappear into traffic. When her Uber arrived, she climbed in and gave the driver an address on the Upper East Side.



Two cars. Two different destinations.



Nathan pulled up outside Vivian's design studio, a trendy space in SoHo with floor-to-ceiling windows and Instagram-worthy displays. She was waiting by the door, wearing a soft yellow dress that made her look fragile and beautiful.



""How did it go?"" she asked, searching his face.



Nathan pulled out his receipt and showed her. ""All taken care of. She signed everything without a fight.""



Forty blocks away, Amelia sat in an exam room at Mount Sinai, staring at the motivational posters on the walls. The paper crinkled under her as she shifted on the table.



""Mia, honey, are you absolutely sure about this?"" Dr. Harper Lopez pulled up a stool, her face creased with concern. ""You've been trying to get pregnant for months. Just last year you were asking me about fertility supplements.""



Amelia placed the courthouse receipt on the small table beside her, right next to the positive pregnancy test she'd taken yesterday morning.



""I'm sure,"" she said, her voice steady as stone.



""I want it gone.""



Chapter 3



Harper stared at the divorce paperwork like it might bite her.



She'd known Amelia for fifteen years, watched her completely lose herself over Nathan Harrison. The girl had literally restructured her entire life around that man—changed colleges, switched majors, turned down jobs in other cities. Harper had watched her best friend shrink into someone she barely recognized.



When they got married last year, Harper thought maybe it would finally be enough. Maybe Nathan would actually see what he had.



Apparently not.



""I'm done with him."" Amelia's voice was steady, matter-of-fact.



She smiled then—not the sad, hopeful smile Harper had gotten used to, but something real. For just a second, Harper saw a flash of the old Amelia. The girl who used to own every room she walked into, back when her dad was alive and the Visconti name still meant something in this city.



""Good,"" Harper said simply. ""About damn time.""



""Nathan doesn't know about the baby."" Amelia's fingers traced the edge of the exam table. ""There's a thirty-day waiting period for the divorce. I can't risk him finding out and trying to use it against me.""



Harper nodded. Made perfect sense. During the cooling-off period, either spouse could withdraw the petition. If Nathan knew about the pregnancy, he'd probably try to guilt her into staying.



""Okay, so here's the thing,"" Harper said, pulling up Amelia's file. ""We can't do the procedure right away. You're type AB-negative, which means we need to special-order blood just in case. It'll take about a week.""



Amelia's face went tight. AB-negative—her father's blood type. One more reminder of everything she'd lost.



""And Mia?"" Harper's voice went gentle. ""You're showing signs of threatened miscarriage. You need to be really careful the next few days. No stress, lots of rest.""



""What does that mean exactly?""



""Cramping, some spotting. Your body's... well, it's under a lot of stress right now. Just take it easy, okay?""



Harper squeezed her friend's shoulder. ""I'm off in like an hour. Want me to drive you home?""



""Yeah, that'd be great.""



Amelia headed to the waiting room, one hand instinctively pressed to her stomach. Was her body already making the decision for her?



Her phone buzzed. Bank alert—deposit from the new account she'd opened that morning. A text followed immediately.



Hey! Royalty check just went through. You should see it in your account now.



Before Nathan, Amelia had been a songwriter. Not the kind who performed—the kind who stayed in the background and crafted hits for other people. Her father had encouraged her music when she was young, back when money wasn't an issue. After he died and everything went to hell, those piano lessons became her survival.



Got it, thanks.



You know, you've written some of our biggest songs. Ever think about stepping into the spotlight? There's this new singing competition—all original material. I could get you an audition.



Amelia scrolled through the email her manager had sent. A reality show, basically, but focused on songwriting and original music instead of covers.



Maybe. Let me think about it.



She set her phone down as a sharp cramp hit her lower abdomen.



God, she missed her dad. If he could see her now...



Meanwhile, social media was having a field day:



\#VivianHopeCancer trending #1



\#FloralDesignerDying trending #3



\#TerminalDiagnosis trending #8



The top video had already hit two million views:



Celebrity floral designer Vivian Hope, known for her work with Manhattan's elite, revealed today that she has terminal stomach cancer and only six months to live. Instead of stepping away from public life, Hope plans to document her final months online.



In the video, Vivian looked ethereal—pale but beautiful, like some tragic heroine. ""I want to share this journey with everyone who might be going through something similar. To show that even when you're dying, you can still choose hope.""



The reporter's voice continued over B-roll footage: ""Hope has been romantically linked to Harrison Industries CEO Nathan Harrison, though Harrison recently married. Sources close to the situation say this could be a real-life tragedy worthy of Hollywood.""



Vivian stepped back into frame, interrupting with practiced grace. ""I'm not going to lie about my feelings. Nathan is... he's an incredible man. But he's married, and I respect that completely. I would never try to come between them.""



She walked away from the cameras, leaving the reporter to wrap up the segment.



The moment she was out of sight, Vivian slipped into a waiting Town Car. A woman in scrubs handed her a water bottle, looking nervous as hell.



""Spit it out,"" Vivian said without looking up from her phone.



The woman glanced at the driver, then leaned closer. ""Miss Hope, your actual diagnosis is just gastritis. Having us falsify medical records is already illegal, but now you're going public with it? What happens when people start digging?""



Vivian's smile was ice-cold. ""Is your clinic a licensed medical facility?""



""Yes, but—""



""Are my records stored independently?""



""Yes.""



""And what do those records say?""



The woman swallowed hard. ""Terminal stomach cancer. Six-month prognosis.""



""Exactly. So if anyone investigates, that's what they'll find."" Vivian's voice turned dangerous. ""And if complications arise later, we have options. Either I make a miraculous recovery thanks to some experimental treatment, or your clinic made a massive diagnostic error that put me through months of unnecessary trauma. Which scenario sounds better for your malpractice insurance?""



The fake nurse went white. ""I understand, Miss Hope. I'm sorry for questioning you.""



""Good. Now, we're going to New York Presbyterian.""



""Is that... safe?""



""I need to pick up some legitimate pain medication. Doctor's orders."" Vivian fired off a quick text to Nathan: At the hospital picking up meds. Can you meet me?



His response was instant: Already on my way.



Two floors up, Amelia sat in a bathroom stall, staring at the bright red blood on the tissue paper. Her hand pressed against her cramping stomach.



It was starting.

1m2v7gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1m2v7gm/when_my_coworker_pretended_we_were_dating_and/,When My Coworker Pretended We Were Dating… and Introduced Me to Her Parents,"Okay. So this happened a few years ago, but I still think about it in the shower, in traffic, when I see her Instagram pop up… you get it.

I (29M, gay) used to work at a mid-sized marketing agency. Not super corporate, but not casual either — we had team lunches, happy hours, that whole “work culture” thing. I was friendly with a coworker named Jessica (28F) — bubbly, a little intense, super talkative. You know the type. We sat near each other, joked a lot, and shared memes on Slack. Nothing flirty, just… friendly.

A few months in, I started getting weird vibes from her. She’d make comments like,
	•	“You’re seriously such boyfriend material,”
	•	“If I were dating you, I’d never let you go,”
	•	or “It’s so crazy we’re both single…”

I’d laugh it off and gently redirect. And for the record: I am very openly gay. Rainbow mug on my desk, pics of me and my ex on my screen saver, Pride flag in my email signature. Like… I’m not hiding anything.

Then came the incident.

One Friday, she asked if I wanted to grab lunch. I said sure, expecting a casual bite. She drove us to a little Italian place, which seemed normal at first — until I realized her parents were already there. Sitting. Waiting.

She turned to me and said:
“Don’t be nervous! They’re excited to meet you.”

I. Froze.
I said, “Wait, meet me? For what?”
She smiled — and I will never forget this — and said,
“I told them about us. I figured it was time.”

US.
She told her parents we were dating.
Not just “talking” or “getting to know each other.” FULL-ON DATING.

I laughed, because I thought she was joking. She wasn’t. Her mom stood up to hug me. Her dad shook my hand. I was trapped in this bizarre rom-com nightmare where I was the lead and didn’t know I’d been cast.

I ended up pulling her aside and saying, “Jessica, I think there’s been a massive misunderstanding. I’m gay.”

And this girl — this grown woman — said:
“You’re just saying that because you’re scared of commitment.”

I wish I was joking.

Her parents were confused when we didn’t return to the table. I ended up calling an Uber and leaving her there. I thought that was the end of it — until she came into work on Monday acting like nothing happened.

Literally came up to me like, “Wanna grab coffee later?” Like we hadn’t just had a fake breakup in front of her family.

I never confronted her again. I just slowly distanced myself. She eventually transferred departments, thank God. But to this day, I sometimes check her social media and she still likes to post cryptic things like,
“Some people aren’t ready for real love.”

Girl.
HOW ARE YOU NOT EMBARRASSED?

I'm the kind of person who helps everyone whenever they have questions, and she started coming to me with doubts and queries. I helped her out, just like I would for any other team member.

Over time, we developed a good bond more like office best friends. Nothing romantic. One day, she asked me out on a date. I was taken aback. I explained that I wasn’t interested in dating at the moment, and I also personally feel that relationships at work are not a good idea. She said it was okay, and I thought that was the end of it.

After that, I started interacting with her less. Not because I disliked her, but because I felt uncomfortable. Some time later, she asked me out again a couple of times. I made excuses to avoid awkwardness.

Yesterday, she asked me out once more. I felt it was time to make things clear, so we went out for coffee. I told her again that I wasn’t looking to date and that I don’t think relationships at work are a good idea. But this time, I was frustrated and ended up raising my voice. I was just tired and upset because I felt like she wasn’t respecting my boundaries.

Now I realize I should not have spoken to her like that. She looked really sad afterward, and I felt terrible. I dropped her home, and I’ve been feeling awful since.

The truth is, it’s not that I don’t like her. She’s incredibly attractive and has a genuinely kind heart. A part of me actually wants to be in a relationship with her. But I’m also scared.

My ex girlfriend passed away from cancer about a year ago, and ever since then, the idea of getting into another relationship terrifies me. The pain of losing someone I loved so deeply still affects me. I guess I haven’t fully healed from that loss. That’s the real reason I don’t want to be in a relationship right now. I’m scared of going through that kind of pain again.

I don’t know how to explain this to her. I feel torn between my emotions, and I truly regret the way I reacted to her. I'm AITK on how I have reacted?

*I saw some comments mentioning the law, so I’ve deleted the photos. If anyone wants to see it, feel free to message me.*

Today in Samut Sakhon, I experienced something I never expected while volunteering at a school. My friend and I are Myanmar Master’s students, spending our semester break doing volunteer work. During lunch, we stopped by Everyday 1990 Cafe for coffee, then waited for our Grab motorbike at a junction nearby to go back to the school.

Out of nowhere, the man in a white shirt in the photos came up and started shouting at us and told us to sit down. We didn’t understand what was going on. We tried to ask them to explain using Google Translate. He pushed me hard, shouted again, and asked, “Where are you from?”

My friend panicked, showed her student card, and said we are Myanmar students from this university. As soon as they heard “Myanmar,” things got worse. They started shouting Thai phrases including “Myanmar.” We didn’t fully understand, but we could feel the racism clearly.

More and more people gathered. Around 20 people, taking photos of our faces, filming our student cards, even doing Facebook Live. But when we tried to record them back, they wouldn’t let us. We kept asking through Google Translate what the problem was. They didn’t answer and just kept shouting. Then, a local girl nearby finally told us there had been a theft at the small juice shop in front of us. They thought we were involved. (P.S. We didn’t even walk past that shop!)

Even when I tried to ask again, the white tshirt man pushed me again and this time, he even tried to punch me‼️ It was just the two of us, surrounded by a crowd of around 20 people. We chose to stay calm and called our professor at the school, who is French. 

While waiting, I saw them hit another person inside the juice shop. That’s when I realized they already caught the real thief yet they still didn’t care about what they did to us.

When our professor arrived, the moment they saw he is a foreigner, everything changed. The same people who had shouted and pushed us suddenly apologized but only to him. Not a single word to us.

Honestly, it was painful. We were treated like criminals just because we are Myanmar.

I really wanted to call the police, but we had to return to the school to finish our tasks and didn’t want to make things bigger. I just wanted to share this here, so people know racism like this is real and getting worse in Thailand.

This is the location where everything happened.

We stayed in Nørrebro on Jægersborggade, which is lined with cute shops and restaurants. Coffee Collective became my daily caffeine fix (dangerously close to where we were staying).

At one end of our street was a mind-blowing playground. I’m talking bikes for kids to ride, toys to play with, sand, slides, swings, the works. And it’s all free. Stuff like this doesn’t really exist in the US unless you’re paying an entry fee, so we were in shock.

At the other end of the street was this park/cemetery (sounds weird, but it’s beautiful). We grabbed Thai takeaway from a nearby spot and had a picnic there. It was one of the most chill afternoons of the trip.

Other playground highlights:

	•	Traffic Light Playground – kids can actually “drive” bikes and learn about stoplights.

	•	Farm Playground – animals and farm-themed fun.

Of course, we hit Tivoli Gardens. Total must-do. The food hall was surprisingly good, and the kids’ area kept our daughter busy while we enjoyed just walking around and soaking it all in.

If you’re a food person, Torvehallerne is also worth a stop. Indoor food hall, tons of options, super easy with a stroller.

One night we went out for drinks at Yellow. Some really exceptional cocktails they are serving up there. Miles and Chris are good dudes. 

Bottom line: Copenhagen is insanely kid-friendly. Playgrounds everywhere, parks galore, food halls, and plenty for adults too. If you’ve got a toddler, it’s a dream.",90,1752820591.0,copenhagen,16,0.9,False

# Best Candle in Bowl 2025: Top Picks & Reviews

The candle in bowl is a sophisticated and versatile home décor item, offering both ambient lighting and aesthetic appeal. These candles, typically housed in decorative bowls made of glass, ceramic, or metal, provide a safer and more elegant alternative to traditional candles.

## Key Features Analysis

The best candle in bowl options for 2025 boast several key features that enhance their performance, safety, and aesthetic value.

**Bowl Material and Design:** The quality and design of the bowl are paramount. High-end options feature bowls made from hand-blown glass, fine porcelain, or brushed stainless steel. These materials are chosen for their durability, heat resistance, and aesthetic appeal. The design may range from minimalist and modern to ornate and traditional, catering to diverse tastes. Some bowls incorporate intricate patterns, textured surfaces, or metallic accents.

The type of material and design directly impact the heat distribution and the overall look of the candle.

**Wax Type and Scent:** The wax used in these candles is crucial for both the burn quality and the fragrance throw. Soy wax, beeswax, and coconut wax are preferred for their clean burning properties and eco-friendliness. Paraffin wax is also used, but often in blends to reduce soot production. The scent profiles vary widely, from floral and fruity to woody and spicy, with many options incorporating essential oils for aromatherapy benefits.

The quality of the wax and the concentration of fragrance oils determine how long the candle burns and how effectively the scent permeates the room.

**Wick Composition and Placement:** The wick plays a vital role in the candle's performance. Cotton wicks, often braided or woven, are common, but newer options include wood wicks, which produce a crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace. The wick's size and placement are carefully calibrated to ensure an even burn and prevent tunneling. Multiple wicks may be used in larger bowls to distribute the heat and fragrance more effectively.

The wick type and placement are critical for achieving a consistent and safe burn.

**Burn Time and Safety Features:** The burn time of a candle in bowl is a key consideration for consumers. High-quality options offer burn times ranging from 40 to 100 hours, depending on the size of the bowl and the type of wax. Safety features, such as heat-resistant bases and automatic shut-off mechanisms, are increasingly common, particularly in electric or battery-operated versions. These features minimize the risk of fire hazards and ensure a safe user experience.

Longer burn times and enhanced safety features provide added value and peace of mind.

Key features of the best candles in a bowl include:

* High-quality bowl materials
* Premium wax blends
* Optimized wick design
* Extended burn times
* Enhanced safety features

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality candle in bowl offers several practical benefits that enhance the ambiance and overall experience.

**Elevated Aesthetic Appeal:** A well-designed candle in bowl serves as a sophisticated decorative element, enhancing the visual appeal of any room. Whether placed on a coffee table, mantelpiece, or bathroom counter, it adds a touch of elegance and warmth. The combination of the flickering flame and the decorative bowl creates a focal point that draws the eye and complements the existing décor.

They can transform a space from ordinary to extraordinary.

**Enhanced Ambiance and Relaxation:** The soft, warm glow of a candle in bowl creates a relaxing and inviting atmosphere. The gentle flickering flame helps to reduce stress and promote a sense of calm. When combined with aromatherapy scents, such as lavender or chamomile, the candle can further enhance relaxation and improve mood.

Users report feeling more at ease and comfortable in spaces illuminated by these candles.

**Convenient and Safe Alternative:** Compared to traditional candles, candles in bowls offer a safer and more convenient experience. The bowl contains the melting wax, preventing drips and spills that can damage surfaces. The enclosed design also reduces the risk of accidental fires, making them a safer option for homes with children or pets.

This means users can enjoy the ambiance of candlelight without the worry of potential hazards.

**Fragrance Diffusion and Aromatherapy:** Many candles in bowls are infused with essential oils or fragrance blends that provide aromatherapy benefits. These scents can help to improve mood, reduce stress, and promote relaxation. The heat from the flame gently diffuses the fragrance into the air, creating a pleasant and inviting aroma.

This provides considerable well-being benefits compared to unscented alternatives.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about candles in bowls.

**What is the best type of wax for a candle in bowl?**
  Soy wax, beeswax, and coconut wax are generally considered the best options for candles in bowls due to their clean burning properties, minimal soot production, and eco-friendliness. They also tend to hold fragrance well and provide a longer burn time compared to paraffin wax.

**How do I prevent tunneling in my candle in bowl?**
  To prevent tunneling, ensure that the first burn allows the entire surface of the wax to melt evenly. This may take several hours, depending on the size of the bowl. Regularly trim the wick to about ¼ inch to prevent smoking and uneven burning. If tunneling does occur, you can try wrapping the bowl in foil to concentrate the heat and melt the remaining wax.

**Are candles in bowls safe to use around pets and children?**
  While candles in bowls are generally safer than traditional candles, it's still important to exercise caution when using them around pets and children. Never leave a burning candle unattended, and keep it out of reach of children and pets. Consider using flameless LED candles in bowls as a safer alternative, especially in high-traffic areas or homes with young children.

**How do I clean a candle in bowl after the wax has burned down?**
  To clean a candle in bowl, first, allow the wax to cool completely. Then, place the bowl in the freezer for a few hours to harden the remaining wax. Once frozen, the wax should easily pop out. You can then wash the bowl with warm, soapy water and dry it thoroughly before reusing it.

Most people attempt financial transformation without knowing their starting point. As Wayne Dyer wisely said, ""When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change."" The Financial Fitness Tracker provides the clarity needed to see where your money actually goes versus where you think it goes. Just like Michael in our example, you might be shocked to discover you're spending $600+ monthly on takeaway food! This financial education tool doesn't make you feel guilty about your morning coffee—instead, it empowers you with awareness, the true key to change and financial freedom.

📊 Master the 5-Level Framework for Financial Growth

Our revolutionary approach categorizes expenses into five clear levels: Necessities (survival expenses), Quality of Life (worth spending on), Splurge (conscious choices), Purge (items to eliminate), and Interest/Debt (costs to eliminate from your life). This powerful framework helps you prioritize asset accumulation and supports your financial goals while distinguishing between needs and wants. The psychology of money becomes clear when you can visualize your complete financial picture in one place.

🛠️ Transform Your Finances with STOP/SWAP/CALL

Take immediate action with our proven three-step approach! For each major expense, decide whether to STOP (cancel unused subscriptions), SWAP (find less expensive alternatives like home-brewed coffee), or CALL (negotiate better rates for insurance, internet, or credit cards). This practical system helped Michael save $3,600 annually with minimal lifestyle changes! As Dave Ramsey says, ""A budget tells your money where to go instead of wondering where it went."" Start directing your money with purpose today.

🚀 Build Your Path to Financial Independence

Implement these practical strategies: 1) Be honest with yourself about expenses, 2) Start where you are—perfection isn't required, 3) Look for patterns rather than pursuing a perfect budget, and 4) Schedule monthly reviews. Remember Warren Buffett's wisdom: ""Don't save what's left after spending; spend what's left after saving.""

## What is NaxReich?

NaxReich is an **automated trading platform** designed to make trading accessible for everyone, regardless of experience. Think of it like your smart assistant for trading—it analyzes markets, predicts trends, and executes trades based on real-time data.

It’s not just for crypto either. NaxReich lets you trade across multiple asset classes, including **cryptocurrencies**, **forex**, **stocks**, and even **commodities**. It’s especially appealing if you’re into diversified trading but don’t want five different apps open at once.

In short, it aims to do the heavy lifting while you focus on strategy—or just enjoy your coffee while trades happen in the background.

## Who Created NaxReich?

The creators of NaxReich are kind of a mystery. Like many algorithmic trading platforms, there’s no public info about a specific founder or company leadership. This might be a red flag for some, but it’s actually pretty common in this space.

From what I could gather, the platform is likely backed by a team of tech and finance experts who have experience building trading algorithms. It seems to share infrastructure with platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**, which suggests a shared development origin, possibly a white-label solution.

**Would I like more transparency?** Sure. But the platform’s performance and user experience speak louder than its anonymous creators—at least for now.

### [🔥 Start Trading with NaxReich Today](https://tinyurl.com/yukdyh5z)
## How Does NaxReich Work?

NaxReich uses **AI-powered algorithms** to scan the market and identify potentially profitable trading opportunities. Once it detects a high-probability setup, it can either alert the user or execute the trade automatically, depending on your settings.

Here’s a simplified version of how it works:

- You sign up and fund your account.
- The system connects you with a **partner broker** (usually regulated).
- The AI scans markets 24/7 for signals.
- You can choose to trade manually or let it run on auto-pilot.
- Profits (or losses) are reflected in your account balance.

It’s not magic, and it’s not risk-free—but it does take away a lot of the grunt work. And that’s a huge win if you’re not into staring at charts all day.

## NaxReich Pros and Cons

Let’s break it down:

**Pros:**

- **User-friendly interface** – Easy to navigate, even for beginners.
- **Supports multiple assets** – Not just crypto; includes forex, stocks, commodities.
- **AI-driven insights** – Faster and smarter than human analysis in many cases.
- **24/7 trading** – The bot doesn’t sleep, so you don’t miss opportunities.
- **Demo account** – Test strategies before risking real money.
- **Low entry barrier** – $250 minimum deposit.

**Cons:**

- **Limited transparency** – No public founder or regulatory info.
- **Risk of loss** – Like all trading, there’s no guarantee of profit.
- **No native mobile app** – It’s mobile-friendly, but browser-based.

## NaxReich – Supported Countries

NaxReich is available in **most countries**, though there are a few exceptions due to local regulations.

Supported regions include:

- **United States**
- **Canada**
- **United Kingdom**
- **Australia**
- **New Zealand**
- **South Africa**
- **Most of Europe**
- **Parts of Asia and South America**

Restricted countries include those with strict regulations on crypto trading—like Iran, North Korea, and a few parts of the Middle East.

Always double-check if your country is supported during the sign-up process.

## NaxReich – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

NaxReich’s AI engine constantly monitors global markets, scanning for profitable trades. It can process data way faster than a human could—think **thousands of signals per second**.

This means you get **up-to-the-minute insights**, helping you avoid chasing trends too late. If you’re tired of laggy indicators or missed entries, this feature is a lifesaver.

### User-Friendly Interface

Even if you’ve never traded before, NaxReich’s layout won’t scare you. The dashboard is clean, with big buttons, simple charts, and clear navigation.

You can adjust settings, view trade history, and toggle between manual and auto trading without getting lost in menus. It’s like the Spotify of trading platforms—works out of the box.

### Mobile Accessibility

No app? No problem. NaxReich’s **mobile-optimized site** works perfectly on your iPhone or Android. I’ve placed and monitored trades while riding the subway, which is pretty dope.

It’s responsive, fast-loading, and doesn’t glitch like some other platforms I’ve tried.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **custom trading alerts** based on your favorite assets or strategies. This way, you’re always in the loop—even if the bot is running on auto.

Alerts come via email or within the dashboard, and they’re super helpful if you prefer a more hands-on approach.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Unlike some platforms that only focus on crypto, NaxReich lets you trade:

- **Cryptocurrencies** (BTC, ETH, etc.)
- **Forex pairs**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities** (like gold and oil)

This makes it a solid choice for people who want to diversify without juggling multiple platforms.

## Is NaxReich a Scam?

I get it—every time a new trading platform pops up, the **""is this a scam?""** question follows. Based on my experience and what I’ve seen:

**No, NaxReich doesn’t seem like a scam.**

It connects users with **real brokers**, offers a **demo account**, and doesn’t make wild promises like “guaranteed profits.” The platform also allows **easy withdrawals**, which is a huge green flag.

That said, always do your own research. And never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on NaxReich?

The minimum deposit to get started is **$250**. That’s pretty standard for auto-trading platforms and gives you enough capital to test different strategies.

You can fund your account using:

- **Credit/debit cards**
- **Bank transfer**
- **E-wallets** (in some countries)

Make sure you verify your account before depositing—it speeds up the withdrawal process later.

### NaxReich Customer Support

Customer service is available **24/7** via:

- **Live Chat**
- **Email**

I tested both. The live chat was responsive, and I got a helpful reply in under 5 minutes. Email took a bit longer (about 6 hours), but the response was detailed.

No phone support yet, but the current setup works well enough.

## How do you start trading on NaxReich?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the NaxReich homepage and fill out the sign-up form. You’ll need:

- Full name

Once registered, you’ll be redirected to a partnered broker to complete your profile.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

To activate your account, you’ll need to:

This is standard KYC stuff and usually takes less than an hour.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding, you can:

- Explore the **demo account**
- Set up **manual or automated trading**
- Customize your **risk preferences**
- Let the bot do its thing (or take control yourself)

## How to Delete a NaxReich Account?

Before deleting:

## The Verdict

If you want an **automated trading platform** that doesn’t require a PhD in finance to use, NaxReich is worth a look. It’s not perfect, but it brings a ton of value for beginners and intermediate traders who want real-time insights and diversified asset access.

It’s meant to help anyone who cooks, bakes, meal-preps, or tracks macros pick a scale that actually fits how they use their kitchen.  

I’ve also included a comparison chart for quick reference.

### Why a Kitchen Scale Matters

A good scale isn’t just for pros. It helps you:

*   Bake with accuracy (less guesswork, better results)
    
*   Track calories or portions
    
*   Save time by skipping cups and spoons
    
*   Brew coffee more consistently
    
*   Measure small items like spices or yeast
    

If you cook often, it makes meal prep easier and helps reduce waste.

### Main Types of Kitchen Scales

*1\. Mechanical (Analog) Scales*

*   No power needed.
    
*   Simple, durable.
    
*   Usually less precise (1 oz or 50 g increments).  
    Best if you value simplicity over precision.
    

*2\. Digital Scales*

*   Most common.
    
*   Precise, often to 1 g or 0.1 g.
    
*   Features like tare, unit switch, backlit display.  
    Best for general cooking and baking.
    

*3\. Pocket or Gram Scales*

*   Compact, very precise (0.01–0.1 g).
    
*   Small capacity.  
    Best for coffee, spices, or travel.
    

*4\. Large-Capacity Scales*

*   Handle 15–33 lbs (7–15 kg).
    
*   Useful for big batches or bulk cooking.
    

*5\. Hanging Scales*

*   Weigh large or odd-shaped items by hanging them.  
    More common in markets or commercial kitchens.
    

*6\. Smart Scales*

*   Connect to apps.
    
*   Track calories, macros, or recipes.  
    Worth it if you track nutrition daily.
    

*7\. Specialty Shapes*

*   Spoon or cup scales.
    
*   Good for liquids or very small amounts.  
    Better as an extra tool, not your only scale.
    

### What to Look For

*Accuracy*

*   For most, 1 g precision is enough.
    
*   Coffee lovers or spice users might want 0.1 g or better.
    

*Capacity*

*   5–11 lbs (2–5 kg) is enough for everyday use.
    
*   More if you bake or cook in bulk.
    

*Tare Function*

*   Lets you zero out container weight.
    
*   Essential for adding multiple ingredients to the same bowl.
    

*Units*

*   Grams, ounces, pounds, milliliters.
    
*   Helps avoid manual conversions.
    

*Build Quality*

*   Stainless steel or tempered glass is easier to clean.
    
*   Avoid wood for daily use.
    

*Display & Controls*

*   Backlit display helps in low light.
    
*   Buttons should be easy to press.
    

*Power Source*

*   Battery, rechargeable, or plug-in.
    
*   Mechanical scales need no power.
    

*Size & Storage*

*   Small kitchens might need a compact design.
    
*   Larger platforms fit big bowls.
    

*Extra Features*

*   Timer, coffee mode, calorie tracking, hold function.
    
*   Pick features you’ll actually use.
    

### Common Mistakes

*   Forgetting to use tare before adding ingredients.
    
*   Using the scale on uneven counters.
    
*   Overloading beyond its max weight.
    
*   Skipping calibration if your scale supports it.
    
*   Not cleaning after each use.
    

### Do You Need a Smart Scale?

If you:

*   Track macros daily
    
*   Want to sync with an app
    
*   Like extra data (protein, carbs, fat)
    

It might be worth it.

If you just need quick, reliable weight readings, a standard digital scale is simpler and cheaper.

I need you to watch her. I’ve got errands. that’s it. no heads up and asking. just dropped her off. I was still in my robe with bedhead, halfway through my coffee. I asked him how long he’d be gone, and he just waved it off like a few hours. it was almost 7.

I love my niece, she’s adorable, but I’m not her default babysitter. I had plans to deep clean, get groceries, and finally relax a bit. Instead, I spent my day chasing a toddler who poured cereal in my shoes and somehow got Play-Doh in my hair.

when he finally came back, he had the audacity to be annoyed that I fed her grilled cheese instead of something healthy. maybe don’t abandon your child if you’re that picky? so I told him look, you can’t just assume I’m free because I’m not working. I’m not a built-in babysitter, and I don’t appreciate being treated like one. he blew up, said I was selfish, said I knew what he’s going through as a single dad. and I do, I feel for him. but I’m also allowed boundaries. I help when I can. not when I’m blindsided.

our mom’s saying I should’ve just helped for family and that I embarrassed him by making a scene. but I didn’t yell, I was calm just firm. still, now I’m the difficult sister.

I’m torn because I don’t want to make things harder for him, but I’m honestly tired of people thinking my time isn’t valuable just because I don’t have kids.",109,1752819887.0,AITH,60,1.0,False

It wasn’t even doomscrolling or anything dramatic. it was just this constant hum in the background. A video while cooking, Reddit while brushing teeth, Instagram while waiting for files to export. I didn’t even realize how much I needed distraction.

So last Monday, I decided to try a 'soft' reset. Not a full digital detox, but just some limits.



# Rules I set!! (Easy ver)

📵 No phone while eating.  
📵 No content while doing chores.  
📵 No screen time 1 hour before bed.  
📱 Only utility apps during work hours.



# Week 1 thoughts (7/17):

• The silence is LOUD. Like, I forgot how noisy my brain is.  
• I now reach for my phone *without even realizing it*. So many muscle-memory habits.  
• Been journaling more, which is... weirdly grounding.  
• Coffee feels stronger when I’m not doomscrolling with it. 😅  
• I caught myself actually watching the trees move outside my window. Like a full 10 seconds of that.

  
What’s been hard?

– Not filling dead time. Waiting for the microwave now feels like a test.  
– Nighttime cravings for stimulation hit different.  
– I keep opening my phone, unlocking it, and just staring. Not even opening anything.



# What surprised me?

– I’m more likely to text people now.  
– I don’t miss social apps as much as I feared.  
– I’ve been drawing just for fun again something I stopped doing years ago.

He was lacking socially. 

He was not successful with women. Sadly, he, had a couple experiences with drunk women who made out with him, but shut off any future connection the next day ""I'm sorry but, I am getting back with my boyfriend"" or ""omg I wasn't thinking I was drunk, I am not interested."" 


He wanted to ask a girl out on a date to a location that a highschool science class would go on a field trip, his explanation was ""it is unique nobody does that."" He was really hype about this idea.


I knew the girl he was going to ask out, and was highly skeptical that she would find this to be an interesting thing to do, but I didn't want to kill his vibe so I shut my mouth. She rejected his offer. I found out more than a year later from her friends that she would have gone out with him somewhere more typical first date, like for coffee. She thought it was a strange place to go on a first date, it was off-putting because it would have been a 3-4 hour commitment.

I really need advice on this because I am struggling a lot. I feel totally backseated by my best friends and it's hurting.

A little context, I've known D (M) for six years, and A (F) for one. I introduced them to eachother shortly after meeting A, and about four months ago they began to date (I know, it's very early and I may just not be used to the change).

I was, and am, extremely happy for them as it seems they have really found their perfect partners. But the only thing is how I have been third wheeling so hard for the last month.

I used to be able to join a game with them or hop on a text convo in our gc easily, but now all they talk about is each other in said gc (there are five other people in this chat as well, which have all become less active). I cam barely play games with them anymore, because when I try they are usually playing duos on whatever and are having them time. The rare times I do join, I am the worst third wheel. Literally.

Just a few weeks ago, we all met D for the first time, since he has lived out of state for most of our friendship. I met him through his cousin, who I went to school with, that's why I trust him with things more than the average online friend.

Anyways, the meet up. We went to the park, had a very nice time, I took pictures of them hugging, cuddling, looking at videos, all that cute couple stuff. And I got one hug. And yeah, sure, we're bros, not mandatory for multiple hugs, but the hug itself felt like something between just-starting-out friends rather than my closest friend of six years. It stung a bit. (Kuddos to my mom BTW because she picked up on my bad mood after and took me for coffee and treats. Thank you mom!)

And then D had to go for a five hour trip back to his house. No goodbye to me, no pictures of all of us together, nothing.

Now comes the part that has really ticked me off. Just a few nights ago, A asked me to 'keep tabs on D for her' since she wouldn't have her phone. Just check in periodically and give updates. What??? I mean, I don't mind talking to D, of course not, but being hired to babysit him for her?? Am I weird for thinking that's just kinda rude...? It was okay, don't get me wrong, we just called for two and a half hours and played some games before he went to bed, but that just weirded me out. 

I think that's it... it's midnight and I'm running on a medium coffee and two teas as I write this, so I may be forgetting some things, but I wanna know if I'm being an AH for this or if my feelings are valid.
