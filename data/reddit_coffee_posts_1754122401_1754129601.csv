1mfmybw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1mfmybw/whats_up_with_the_cafe_culture_and_ridiculously/,What's up with the Cafe culture and ridiculously expensive food ?,"The cafe culture has become a pattern in almost every city in India. New instagram pics place opening and nothing great about the place except for the interiors. Coffee is really expensive starting from 250 rupees for a small cup and goes to 450/500 if you want flavors or vegan milk. And food is subpar and bland, but ridiculously costly. 

Today, I went with two friends to a small cute cafe. The seating was outdoors so there was no AC and just one standing fan in a corner. So hey, they are not really spending money on electricity or AC devices. We ordered french fries, garlic bun, one veg sandwich, one pastry slice and two basic drinks. And THE BILL CAME AROUND 3000 RUPEES. 

French fries quantity was so less and it was fcking 360 rupees. And the garlic bun was smaller than my palm size. Sandwich had very less filling and it was around 550 rupees. None of them felt fresh or tasty especially the bread seemed very stale. Our bill came to 3k rupees and it felt like we just ruined our day by going there amidst unusually high traffic. We didn't eat breakfast and this just left us more hungry with empty pockets. And this place had over a thousand reviews and 4.3* rating on Google. We wished we chose a better place or easily gone to an asian restaurant atleast for that price. 

So this has lately been the experience with outside food. Just pay so much money and get very little in return, and additionally have upset stomach inviting more problems! I don't mind paying a little high amount for food like pizza or sushi, cos it's hard to make at home, and they are quite filling as a meal. 

But the food at cafes? Really? What's the explanation for high rates and stale food? It's literally just garlic, cream or butter on a bread they are serving! Vegetables are hardly three table spoons, and not even fresh. IS THIS WHAT THE STANDARD OF FOOD HAS BECOME IN OUR COUNTRY? 

And I know coffee beans are a little expensive, but still even that is not justifying such a ridiculously high amount for one cup of coffee? Like 475 rupees for a soy milk latte is f*cking ridiculous!

Nestled in the misty hills of[ Morocco’s Rif Mountains, a centuries-old cannabis culture](https://hightimes.com/tag/morocco/) is undergoing a profound transformation. Long famed for its[ golden hashish](https://realitysandwich.com/magickal_oil_hashish/), smoked across Europe and beyond, Morocco is now walking the tightrope between tradition and regulation, between kif and clinics.

This North African kingdom, once the world’s top exporter of illicit hash, is trying to [rebrand itself as a leader in the legal medical and industrial cannabis space](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/legal-cannabis-blooms-morocco-black-market-still-beckons-2025-07-29/). But the journey is anything but smooth.

# A Brief History of Moroccan Cannabis

The story of cannabis in Morocco spans over a thousand years, intertwining spirituality, colonization, rebellion, and rural survival. What began as a mystical herb used in Sufi rituals evolved into a cornerstone of one of the world’s most prolific hashish economies.

# Origins: From the Silk Road to the Rif

Cannabis likely arrived in Morocco sometime between the 10th and 15th centuries, brought by Arab merchants, Andalusian refugees, or through contact with Persian and Indian traditions during the Islamic Golden Age. The plant took root in the fertile valleys and slopes of the Rif Mountains, a remote and rugged region in northern Morocco, perfectly suited for clandestine cultivation.

The plant quickly gained cultural significance. Among Sufi mystics, kif was used in dhikr (remembrance of God) ceremonies to enhance spiritual insight and reach ecstatic states. In rural Berber villages, it became an integral part of social life shared over long conversations, music, and mint tea. Rather than a drug, kif was a ritualized experience, always consumed communally in sebsi pipes.

# Colonial Era: Legalization and the Roots of the Hashish Trade

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Morocco came under French and Spanish colonial rule. The colonial powers adopted vastly different approaches to cannabis.

In 1917, the Spanish administration officially legalized cannabis farming in its northern protectorate, including the Rif region. This wasn’t a progressive drug policy; it was a way to pacify tribal leaders and maintain political control. Cannabis was permitted in certain areas under license, especially in Ketama, which would later become the hash capital of the world.

Meanwhile, the French were more restrictive in their southern zones, but enforcement was uneven. The colonial era allowed kif to flourish under the radar, and local farmers increasingly refined their knowledge of cultivation and processing.

By the early 20th century, Moroccan hashish was already making its way across the Mediterranean, especially to France and Spain, where it gained a niche following among bohemians, expatriates, and soldiers.

# Post-Independence: Prohibition Meets Tolerance

In 1956, Morocco gained independence from colonial rule. One of the new government’s first acts was to ban cannabis nationwide, attempting to align with international drug conventions and present a modern image.

But the ban came with a massive caveat: cultivation continued, unofficially tolerated in the Rif Mountains, largely for political and economic reasons. The Rif region had long been marginalized by the central government, and cannabis cultivation was often the only viable income in the mountainous terrain.

In this gray zone of tolerance, cannabis cultivation exploded. What had been a spiritual and social tradition turned into into a massive cash crop, smuggled across Europe via Spain. By the 1980s and 1990s, Morocco was producing over 3,000 tons of cannabis resin per year, according to UN estimates, making it the world’s top exporter of hashish.

# The Hippie Trail and Global Recognition

The 1960s and ’70s brought a new wave of cannabis culture to Morocco. Western backpackers and hippies,[ traveling the famed “Hippie Trail”](https://hightimes.com/culture/the-tale-of-the-hippie-trail/) from Europe to India, passed through Morocco and discovered its legendary hash.

Places like Chefchaouen, with its blue-washed walls and mountain backdrop, became cannabis tourism hubs. Foreigners flocked to Ketama for its hashish, often staying in local homes, helping with the harvest, and learning the art of kif from seasoned Berber growers.

[Moroccan hashish](https://hightimes.com/dabs/simplicity-competition-passion-the-art-of-hashmaking/), soft, golden, and potent, became a fixture in Amsterdam coffee shops, Paris cafes, and British music festivals. It was a brand without needing a label.

# Crackdowns and Erasure (1990s–2010s)

Under pressure from international drug enforcement agencies, particularly from Europe, the Moroccan government began periodic crackdowns on cannabis production starting in the late 1990s.

Fields were burned. Farmers were arrested. Alternative crops like figs and olives were promoted. But the economic dependency on cannabis was too deep and the mountainous terrain too difficult to police effectively.

At its peak, an estimated 800,000 Moroccans, around 10% of the population, were economically tied to the cannabis trade. Efforts to dismantle the industry often backfired, leading to increased unemployment, resentment, and migration from rural areas.

Despite the risks, [cannabis remained the unofficial lifeblood of the Rif.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif)

# The Shift to Legalization (2021–Present)

In 2021, the Moroccan government passed Law 13-21, marking the country’s first formal recognition of cannabis as a legal industry. The law legalizes the medical, cosmetic, and industrial use of cannabis, placing Morocco in line with global cannabis reforms.

Legal cultivation is now overseen by ANRAC, and registered farmers must join approved cooperatives and obtain licenses. Though intended to empower local farmers and undercut criminal networks, the rollout has faced bureaucratic hurdles, pricing challenges, and resistance from legacy growers.

Still, the law represents a radical pivot in Moroccan cannabis policy, shifting from back-alley crackdowns to regulated fields, with the potential for export markets and pharmaceutical partnerships.

# What Makes Moroccan Cannabis Culture Unique?

To understand Morocco’s cannabis future, you have to appreciate its past. In the Rif Mountains, cannabis is not simply a crop or a commodity. It is part of the cultural fabric. Known locally as “kif,” it has been consumed for centuries in ceremonial, social, and spiritual settings. Kif is often smoked in a long, narrow wooden pipe called a sebsi, accompanied by conversation, mint tea, or music. Among Sufi mystics, kif was sometimes used to enhance spiritual practices such as chanting and trance-like meditations. In rural homes, it became part of the rhythm of life, shared communally and without stigma.

What sets Moroccan cannabis culture apart is the [traditional process of hash-making](https://hightimes.com/guides/make-hash/), which has evolved into a specialized artisanal craft. After harvest, cannabis plants are dried and then carefully beaten over silk screens to separate the trichomes. This fine powder, called kief, is then pressed using heat and manual techniques into hashish blocks. The resulting hash varies in color and quality, with Morocco’s iconic “blonde” hash prized across Europe for its smooth texture and balanced effects.

Beyond the ritual and craft, the cannabis economy has been a pillar of survival for tens of thousands of families in the Rif region. With little access to state support or modern infrastructure, entire villages have relied on cannabis as their primary source of income. It funded education, home repairs, and even migration to cities. For many, cannabis was never about counterculture rebellion or Western-style recreation. It was about feeding families and maintaining dignity in the face of economic neglect.

In this way, Moroccan cannabis culture is deeply rooted, fiercely local, and shaped by generations of resilience. It is not just a legacy of agriculture, but a way of life tied to the land, the people, and their collective memory.

# Legalization: A New Chapter

[In 2021, Morocco passed Law 13-21](https://www.moroccancannabisalliance.com/2025/06/25/what-law-13-21-really-means/), which legalized cannabis for medical, cosmetic, and industrial use. The move came in response to international legalization trends—and years of pressure from European governments facing hashish smuggling at their borders.

[The government established ANRAC (National Agency for the Regulation of Cannabis Activities)](https://hightimes.com/news/morocco-officials-appoint-new-leader-of-cannabis-agency/) to oversee the industry. Farmers must now register cooperatives, obtain licenses, and sell only to government-authorized buyers.

# 2025 Snapshot:

* 5,000 farmers registered with the legal cannabis program (up from 430 in 2023).
* Nearly 4,200 tonnes of legal cannabis were cultivated in 2025.
* 5,800 hectares under legal cultivation—but 27,000+ hectares still producing illegally.
* The price paid to legal farmers: 50 dirhams per kilogram of raw plant.
* The illicit market price for hashish: 2,500 dirhams per kilogram.

# The Challenge: Illicit Market Still Dominates

Despite the legal rollout, the illicit market remains king. The math is simple. Legal cannabis pays pennies. Illegal hash pays bills.

Legalization has brought freedom to some growers. Farmers like Abderrahman Talbi, interviewed by *Reuters*, now grow without fear of raids. “Peace of mind has no price,” he says. Others, like Mohammed Azzouzi, recently received royal pardons for prior offenses and are preparing their first legal harvests.

But many cultivators are hesitant to switch. The red tape is thick, payments are slow, and the pricing makes legal farming barely sustainable. With demand for Moroccan hash still strong in Europe, thousands remain committed to the illicit trade.

# Medical, Not Recreational

While countries like Germany, Canada, and several U.S. states explore full recreational markets, Morocco is firm: recreational use is still banned. According to ANRAC head Mohamed Guerrouj, the country’s focus is purely pharmaceutical and industrial. Talk of cafes and dispensaries remains a distant fantasy for now.

Still, critics argue that without opening up the recreational space, the country won’t effectively displace the illicit market. The restrictions may stifle Morocco’s ability to compete with global producers like Colombia, Canada, or Thailand.

# The Future of Cannabis in Morocco

Morocco has the terroir, the history, and the generational expertise to become a global leader in cannabis. Its climate is ideal, its farming knowledge is unmatched, and its[ hashish has long been regarded as some of the finest in the world](https://hightimes.com/tag/hash/). But for the legal cannabis industry to truly thrive, Morocco must confront the disconnect between well-intentioned regulation and on-the-ground realities.

To move forward, the government must simplify licensing procedures and ensure payments are made efficiently to participating farmers. Current bureaucratic delays and low pricing discourage transition into the legal system. If legal cannabis is to compete with the illicit market, farmers need economic incentives that reflect the value of their labor and product.

A national conversation about controlled recreational use may also become necessary. While Morocco’s current framework limits cannabis to medical and industrial applications, opening the door to adult-use could help legitimize more of the existing economy and offer new streams of tax revenue and international trade.

Just as important is the preservation of traditional hash-making techniques and cultural heritage. The government’s success will depend not only on its ability to regulate but on its willingness to **support legacy growers** and respect the deep cultural significance cannabis holds in the Rif.

Until those gaps are bridged, Morocco will remain in a paradoxical position, producing legal cannabis on paper while much of its finest hash continues to move through underground networks.

It’s free, it’s private and it’s kinda fun!

Like most people, my fluency goes up and down depending on situations. My biggest problems have been standing in a line to buy a coffee or a sandwich at a busy takeaway: I feel the stress of the impending order, can feel the people behind me impatient to get their orders and so on. When I get to the counter, I stammer badly with my order, which is frustrating and embarrassing. I have in the past written my order on a text file on my phone to show the counter worker, and I’ve used TTS apps to speak for me, but these have felt a bit lacking.

So I’ve found a free tool called Chatterbox TTS you can run on your local computer that clones any voice and produces audio files from any text you enter. Most people just find an audio file of their favourite actor or whatever, speaking for a 10 or more seconds, then upload it to Chatterbox, enter their text, and the software will produce an audio file of that person speaking those words. It’s not 100% soundalike, but it’s pretty close.

Of course, I had to try it with my voice, right? I know Chatterbox works best with a good quality audio source, so I recorded myself speaking normally for about a minute (including a few stammers) using Audacity. I then uploaded the WAV file to Chatterbox on my computer and entered some text – and it produced an audio file of me speaking those words! Again, it’s not perfect, but it’s incredibly close. And considering it’s free and completely private (you don’t even need internet to run it), it’s amazing.

The cool part about Chatterbox is that you can control the emotional inflection it speaks. So you can type in your words to speak and vary how excited or relaxed the cloned version of you speaks. You can also vary the speed. The emotional resonance along with your voice clone is uncanny.

Using Chatterbox is a bit of a faff. The install is semi technical but you can run it on most computers. You don’t need a GPU or anything crazy. It really only handles up to about 80 text word at a time so for longer text, you need to type in about 80 words, generate the audio file, then enter the next 80 words, and so on. And depending on your computer, it takes a minute or two to generate each 80 word segment into an audio file.

Now I have a library of MP3 files on my phone of me saying different often used phrases that I can use in different situations ‘One falafel, with extra hot sauce, and a coke, to takeaway, please’, ‘a tall black americano to take away please, for Jack’. I just play the Mp3 of the phrase on my phone and it’s my voice ordering!

I also have a problem with stammering when I first meet someone and saying my name. So when I meet someone I’ll just play the MP3 of me saying ‘Hi. I’m Jack. I have a bit of a stammer when I first meet someone but it will reduce as we talk’ which helps me relax into conversations and become more fluent. And the voice speaking is my cloned voice which I think sounds better to the other person than those common TTS voices.

I’ve also used it to create social media voice-overs using my voice for presentations and social media. And I’m even using it to produce an audiobook of a few things I’ve written. I can imagine all sorts of uses, especially as it runs privately on your computer (you don’t need to be online to run it), so you can use to create spoken love letters or speak to a family member in your voice and so on.

So anyway, I’m in no way connected with Chatterbox and I have no idea why it’s free. But I’ve been using it for months and it’s been loads of fun. I hope you find it useful.

If you want to try it, look for Chatterbox TTS installation videos on the usual places. Many of the videos make it more complicated than it needs to be. Also try asking ChatGPT how to install it after describing your computer specifications.",1,1754128611.0,Stutter,0,1.0,False
1mfmqva,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGrailSearch/comments/1mfmqva/the_only_one/,The Only One,"In the 2017 book Social Capitalism, Mark Romel said, “Nick Hanauer is the only plutocrat for whom we have any shred of respect. Here’s why…” 

Mark Romel quoted Wikipedia for context with the statement, ""In May 2012, several online news outlets reported that Nick Hanauer's March 1, 2012, TED talk on inequality had not been posted online by TED Talks. In that short presentation he critiqued what he called 'an article of faith for Republicans:' the assertion that 'if taxes on the rich go up, job creation will go down? Businesses and the rich do not create jobs, he said. Jobs are created by a feedback loop between customers and businesses that is set in motion by consumers increasing their demand. Thus he proposed the necessity for higher median incomes for workers rather than tax breaks for the wealthy, stating that if lower income tax rates for the wealthy really worked 'we would be drowning in jobs, and yet unemployment and underemployment is at record highs? As justification for not posting the talk, Chris Anderson, curator of TED, stated that he felt Hanauer's talk was 'explicitly partisan' and included a number of unconvincing arguments such as his 'apparent ruling out of entrepreneurial initiative as a root cause of job creation.""

Mark Romel went on to say, “Nick Hanauer knows what's coming. Donald Trump's Ascendancy is yet another desperate attempt by the plutocratic elite to stop you reaching for your pitchforks, but when Trump dismally fails in the White House, even all of the right wing traitors might at last wake up and smell the coffee. The political elite previously served as a bulletproof barrier for the economic elite. Anything that went wrong politically could be blamed on the politicians. However, now one of the economic elite is in the White House, and that means the economic elite will be blamed when the shit hits the fan. There is no politician to blame now. Trump, a member of the Ownership Class, is the President. This is therefore the greatest opportunity the American Jacobin movement has ever had. Live free or die!”

Sounds like a TED Talk well worth listening to! In Social Capitalism, Mark Romel brilliantly analyzes and expands on many of the points on made by Nick Hanauer in addition to multiple other powerful thinkers on capitalism and mammonism. This book is an absolute must-read, especially with the today’s cultural and political climate.

No one cuts right to the heart of the problems of modern society quite like an AC author, however the following TED talks do represent the extremely rare example of a member of the rich elite explaining some of the ideas the PI have laid out across more than 230 books. Enjoy!

[Nick Hanauer: Beware, fellow plutocrats, the pitchforks are coming - TED Aug 2014](https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_beware_fellow_plutocrats_the_pitchforks_are_coming?language=en)

The following is another TED talk Nick Hanauer did a few years later. While Nick misses the mark by not going nearly far enough in his thinking and failing to outline a genuine solution to the problems our world faces, it’s certainly worth the time to listen to this presentation and consider where his ideas align with Illuminism and Meritocracy, and where he falls short.

[Nick Hanauer: The dirty secret of capitalism and a new way forward - TED July 2019](https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_the_dirty_secret_of_capitalism_and_a_new_way_forward?language=en)

Nick ends his second TED Talk with a list of 5 principles to underline his position. They are the following:

1. “Markets are gardens not jungles.” 

The current system of unregulated predatory free market capitalism causes all of the economic and social problems in the west today. We must view capitalism as a tool. Tools are not good or evil, but how they are used creates good or evil outcomes. We must harness the strengths of capitalism while strictly regulating the scope of its power. The people must always be in charge of the economy, not an unelected, unaccountable “invisible hand” of the market. Right wing libertarians are creatures of the jungle. Left wing Jacobins are of the garden.

2. “Inclusion creates economic growth: Including more people in more ways grows the economy.”

From the perspective of a predatory capitalist, this could be interpreted as creating maximum diversity in order to create the largest possible market and opportunity for profit. This line of thinking is exactly what has led our culture down the path of the lowest common denominator towards culture wars, Last Men, Wokeism, globalization, and a global immigration crisis. 

Instead of right wing, negative liberty inclusion, we need left wing, positive liberty inclusion. This means creating an economic system that INCLUDES the workers in reaping the benefits of the economy (opposed to grossly over-rewarding the elites and grossly under-rewarding the workers). This means including the people (in all their diversity) together under a single prevailing monoculture that is moving everyone in the same direction - with the aim of optimizing every citizen, not slavishly promoting economic gain as the highest good, the worship of Mammon, and the pursuit of infinite profit.

3. “The purpose of the corporation is not to simply enrich share holders - it is to improve the welfare of all shareholders”

Predatory free market capitalism is all about the pursuit of infinite profit. It is total Mammonism (the worship of the dollar)! The idea that the world is a money making machine where people and corporations exist to earn money is ultimately sick and incredibly nihilistic. We must revalue all values and collectively decide what humanity exists for. Where are we going? We are currently in the fast lane towards ultimate triviality, division, and weakness in the name of profit. Do we want to keep heading in this direction? Or can we set our sights higher than that? Could humanity transcend the profit principle and achieve something greater? Could we make this world a community of the divine where everyone is maximally inspired to achieve all they can? In the popular TV show Star Trek, Captain Jean-Luc Picard said, “The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity.” Doesn’t that sound infinitely better than the disgraceful values our institutions appear to have today? The state must force corporations to work for the commonwealth, not as powerful multinational rogue actors pursuing their own selfish aims.

4. “Greed is not good: being rapacious does not make you a good capitalist it makes you a sociopath.”

Here we have what should be one of the most obvious statements of all time, but tragically, there are tens of millions of right wingers that cannot understand this. As Gore Vidal said, “Ayn Rand's 'philosophy' is nearly perfect in its immorality, which makes the size of her audience all the more ominous and symptomatic as we enter a curious new phase in our society... To justify and extol human greed and egotism is to my mind not only immoral, but evil.""

Mark Romel wrote, “Right wingers are unquestionably Satanic. They hate the human race. Ayn Rand wrote, ‘I am done with the monster of we, the word of serfdom, of plunder, of misery, falsehood and shame. And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peace and pride. This god, this one word: I.’ There you have it. Right wingers hate ‘we’ — the collective, the community, society, the State, civilization - and worship ‘I’. Right wingers are anti-social and toxic. Every belief they hold and cherish is contrary to the General Will, the Commonwealth, the Common Good.”

It’s time to call out this predatory ideology for what it is. It’s time for the people to come together under a single banner and demand an end to the right wing policies that are destroying the world. Meritocracy accounts for the harsh reality that many humans are motivated by greed and selfishness by sublimating those instincts into positive directions (or at least into directions that cause the minimal degree of harm). Meritocracy must subjugate the drives of the Freudian Id to those of the Superego. Positive liberty must overcome negative liberty.

5. “The laws of economics are a choice, unlike the laws of physics.”

Predatory capitalism cites the “invisible hand of the market” as if it is some divine force that can do no wrong. They claim that it is ultimately moral, and interfering with the market is actually immoral and causes harm to those living under it. Isn’t it time to call bullshit on this idea? This narrative can only be rooted in two things - sheer incompetence by the ruling elites or an insidious attempt by the ruling elites to keep the gravy train rolling for them (and fuck everyone else). Which do you think it is? 

Here’s the truth about the market. It’s the vehicle elite capitalists and bankers use to transfer economic power away from the people into private hands. At all times, the private elites are pushing their own selfish agenda which is explicitly opposed to the General Will of the people. We must demand the state take control back from these unaccountable elites and place the economy under the guidance of meritocraticly elected officials who are accountable to the people. This is how we create a stable economy free of the boom and bust cycles created by greed and fear. This is how we ensure working people are rewarded according to the value they provide the community. This is how we put an end to the people in power enriching themselves with laws and policies that oppress us. 

Any claim otherwise is the propaganda of the ruling class or the delusions of someone who has been implanted with a totally false consciousness.

===

And as the capitalist elites continue to fail to implement left wing, meritocratic, jacobin economic policies, we will continue to inch towards the state of France just before The Revolution.

In a bid to Hemingway, Nick said “Revolutions, like bankruptcies, come gradually, and then suddenly.” 

Mark Romel concurred by saying “Though the super rich have constructed the most robust false consciousness in the masses, it's still not enough. The tide of misery, resentment and hatred is rising all the time, with greater and greater force. When the dam bursts, the collective false consciousness will collapse. Everyone will see reality as it truly is all at once.” 

Without change, the pitchforks will come. It is only a matter of time now.

My biggest issue seems to be that I have no idea where to start. I’ve taken classes in childcare/ child development in high school and college, have about 3/4 months of experience at YMCA as a camp counselor, but that’s it. I love children though and have an amazing work ethic. I guess my question is, are the sites where you pay $10-$30 worth it? Like Care.com, sittercity, etc.?

1mfmqk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1mfmqk1/additional_stimulants_in_energy_drinks/,Additional stimulants in energy drinks,"Long before even thinking about N or getting diagnosed, back when I thought I was just some guy with a caffeine addiction I learned that not all caffeine is equal. Per se a 200mg caffeine pill always seemed weaker than what should be 200mg worth of coffee, or the same 200mg in soda. I’m guessing this has something to do with the source or how it’s absorbed. 

Anyway, fast forward a while and I always thought per MG redbull hit the hardest in a good way, and partially chalked it up to the added Taurine plus sugars or whatnot. Well, about a week ago I got suckered into the sale of some C4 energy drinks. One flavor had the usual 200mg caffeine and felt as such, but another flavor woke me TF up to a level almost as strong as 20mg ritalin IR. Turns out it has 300mg caffeine… cool, but still shouldn’t work that well, but then I did some reading on the can and it’s branded as “triple stim” which is caffeine, plus Theacrine and Dynamine. And doing some light research, Theacrine is some pretty cool stuff, and I might go ahead and order some directly from the MFG to have on hand. 

TLDR: anyone experience some of the added other stimulants to energy drinks actually working well? ",1,1754128432.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

1mfmovj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_Kingmaker/comments/1mfmovj/your_worst_nightmare/,Your worst nightmare.,"All of the companions face their fair share of ghoulish horrors (metaphorically and literally) through their journeys.  
Still, deep down, even the most stoic crusader has a terrible fear that can be unleashed to render them a quivering wreck...

Regill:  
Everyone in the castle was asleep, including Regill, but not a soul in this place was resting peacefully.  
In his dreams, Regill and his companions were fighting a pack of ghouls led by some mythic nabusu.  
At first, it seemed like they would reign triumphant, especially since they were backed by an elite squad of hellknights aiding them, but suddenly, Regill wasn't sure why, the Nabusu cast some kind of spell, and Regill was petrified like a statue.  
All he could do was watch as the hellknights fell apart, collapsing like babes in fear with their hands over their heads.  
His eyes were unblinking as Lann, Sosiel, Ember, and the hungry ghouls overran everyone and either turned or were torn asunder.  
Regill broke free suddenly and raised his weapon, but before he could even take another step, he was surrounded by the ghouls, which included his former allies. Abnormally powerful ghouls pinned down Regill, and his armor cracked open like a lobster's shell.  
He could feel no pain, only deep wrongness and discomfort as his chest was opened and the only people he respected now scooped at his intestines.  
.  
.  
.  
.  
Regill jolted awake.  
He did not scream or cry, but a strange sort of choked gasp broke free from his lips, and his face was briefly contorted in an expression of pain.  
The Hellknight raised his head and looked back and forth before falling back asleep.  
Woljiff:  
""Oh, jeez!""  
Cried Woljiff as a fellow thiefling was carted into the local infirmary, their body was covered with slashes that were seemingly knife-born, but with the patterns and deepness, it seemed more likely to be the claw marks of some horrible beast.  
But what beast could even do that? A dire wolf? A bear? Maybe a babau?  
However, none of those things were subtle; an especially brilliant babau may be able to eke it out without getting noticed, but no demon was precise enough to leave cuts that killed so effectively, especially not an unarmed one living in the sewers.  
But that thiefling was just the most recent hit; 2 thieflings had died earlier, all murdered similarly, though this one seemed like he could still be saved.  
But Woljiff wasn't ready for what came when the tiefling awoke.  
As soon as Darryl regained his senses and looked upon Woljiff, the young man practically scattered backward like a frightened spider.  
""T-That's him! He did it, Woljiff attacked me like a fucking savage animal!""  
The eyes were upon him, and the tief could feel them burning into his soul.  
And in an instant, Woljiff felt his perspective separate from his flesh, and suddenly he was watching himself from 3rd person.  
And all he could do was just watch as he took out his dagger and finished off the weakened tiefling, and began a horrible massacre, he killed every single thiefling in that damn room, the blood puddles were getting so high, he thought he might swim in them.  
But suddenly, as soon as the last of his brothers and sisters hit the floor, Woljiff regained control of his body.  
Just in time for the city guards to burst through the door.  
He believed he could take on all of his fellow rogues, so he felt confident in his chances. However, suddenly everything seemed to move in slow motion.  
He was seized and his face slammed against the floor as the uncaring guards restrained him.   
Bubbles rose as he struggled, drowning in the blood of the only people he knew who cared about him.  
.  
.  
.  
.

Woljiff rose suddenly, he let out a choked scream that he quickly muffled with his hand, before surveying the room, he looked to his side, and there was a tiefling, eyes gouged out, left horn torn off and stabbed into his stomach, but the worst part about it was the blood streaming down the young man's cheeks.  
""I thought you were my brother...""  
...

Woljiff rose again, this time quietly, but with even more fear nonetheless.  
The arcane trickster vaguely noticed a strong magical presence in the room just as he awoke, but wrote it off as the magic in his soul priming for combat with a non-existent foe.  
Woljiff slowly slid off his covers, crept towards the castle dining room, stole himself a whole wheel of cheddar, and started taking slices with his dagger and eating them quietly.  
He heard a creak and, almost irrationally, readied a spell of fireball in his claws.

  
Lann:

  
Lann was in 1st person for his dream, but everything was out of his control, it was like he was on a ride that he couldn't stop.

Wenduag bowed loyally before the knight commander, now a demon lord of the abyss.  
""Master, what shall my servants do with the captured peasants?""  
""Feed them to the demons; we have no use for prisoners.""

Wenduag turned around and smirked at Lann.  
""Well? You heard him, Lann. Go get the prisoners!""  
Lann said something he would never say.  
Which was nothing, he just bowed and turned around.  
Lann watched himself manhandle innocent people, throwing them into a pit of hungry minions fighting like animals over the humans they found most delicious.  
But the worst horror was yet to come.  
He watched his kin patrolling the commander's new castle. They were even worse than just animals; they were barely distinguishable from demons, and they were the commander's favorite enforcers.  
Sure, they seemed to have overcome the rage, but in place of that was something that Lann found even more chilling, cold, and unprotesting obedience.  
Lann now saw himself sitting at a feasting table with Wenduag and his fellow mongrels, eagerly gorging on human flesh, Lann tasted copper as he engaged in barbarism with his kin.  
But something about this made something within Lann surge, and he suddenly gained control of his body.  
Lann gasped, and put down the chunk of halfling heart he was once eating like the finest beef.  
""Lann..?""  
Hissed one of the mongrels.  
""Is... Is something wrong?""  
""Yes, everything is wrong! What's going on?! Why are we eating human flesh?!""  
""This isn't human flesh, it's halfling! More tender, and plenty of pre-meal entertainment, too.""  
Lann shuddered in disgust, with little time to think, he fired an arrow at Wenduag, hitting her in the stomach and distracting the mongrels, allowing him to get out of the table and run away.  
He somehow knew exactly where everything here was, like in this dream-world, he had been Wenduag's mindless enforcer for years, decades even.  
Immediately, Lann rushed to the prisoners, hoping that he could help them escape from this metaphorical and literal hell he found himself in.  
But something he found on his way there made him stop in his tracks, just before he turned around to enter the prison ward.  
It...  
It was... a boy.  
Or what seemed quite boy-like to Lann, a tiefling, probably 6-7, give or take.  
He was wearing blood-soaked robes and had just pitter-pattered out of the prison ward.  
""H-hey! Are you okay? Did-did Wendu hurt you?""  
""No, Wenduag gave me dinner.""  
Xorges mumured timidly, like the innocent humans he consumed were your run-of-the-mill mid-day treat.  
But his encounter with that odd tiefling distracted him from the footsteps rushing behind him, it was the knight commander, and a very pissy Wenduag.  
""He shot me, master! Please let me punish him!""  
""And you shall, but keep him alive. He's very good at interrogations, remember how he got that kitsune to tell us about all of queen galfrey's darkest secrets?""  
Lann found himself walking in mud, barely able to move or resist as Wenduag grabbed him and pulled him away into her bedroom, which also seemed to be the commander's.  
She shoved him against the wall, and he thought she was going to ravish and debase him, but instead, she dug her sharp teeth into the scale-less side of his face, tearing a piece of flesh away from his face.  
Lann whimpered in pain, but he felt none, just this really uncanny feeling of wrongness and discomfort.  
Wenduag let out a hag-like cackle as she looked down at the vulnerable mongrel, and the last thing Lann heard was the savage chanting of the mongrels as they feasted on innocent flesh.

  
Lann awoke not with a scream, not with a cry, but with an odd gasp.  
It was like he had been underwater unable to breath for some time and suddenly found himself on the surface, Lann reflexively clutched his upper chest like he was in the thrall of a heart-attack, like the one that killed his brother.

Just a dream...  
Lann sighed, looking around to confirm that he was in the real world, before going to the kitchen, brewing a bit of tea to calm his nerves, and meditating to clear his mind.  
Then he felt... a poke?

  
Sosiel:

  
He was watching himself, a clone seemingly as he still had flesh, he just couldn't move.  
He watched as a raging Sosiel rampaged across his room, tearing up his own paintings, shouting curses he would never normally utter, and most horribly, taking the shrine to the eternal rose he held near his bed, and stomping on it until the clay had turned into powder.  
He regained the ability to move, but could only do so at a fourth of a human's speed.  
Trevor suddenly entered the room, and tried to ask his brother why he was making all this noise in 2 AM, but he barely got a word out before the raging Sosiel suddenly struck him with his glaive, and Trevor dissapeared... again.  
Sosiel suddenly snapped back into his body, and could only stare at the vague imprint on the floor where his brother once stood, 

Sosiel awoke silently, he moved into sitting position, and let a few tears fall from his face, before recomposing himself and praying to Shelyn for answers on why this horrible dream showed it's face.

Daeran:

The debauched man celebrated, he was finally free of the Other, he could finally live life as he wanted, unafraid!  
Daeran was in the middle of his after-afterparty, when he felt a cold presence enter the room.  
Before he could ask if it was the men bringing the ice shrimp in, darkness took him.  
He was in the void.  
The Other had returned, and as punishment, it took him to this empty space, and just.. left him there.  
Daeran laughed, he chuckled and chortled, surely this was some joke? some temporary thing? Some illusion?  
Surely he would be released eventually?  
No answer.  
Daeran wandered the void, and waited, but he found nothing but more and more \*Black\*.  
Daeran sat down, and stared at the nothingness that surrounded him, not another photon of light would reach his eyes again.  
For once, Daeran was going to say it.  
He was.... lonely.

Daeran awoke with a jolt.  
For a moment, he thought the endless darkness of the room meant he was still in that void, and thought fate was teasing him, but he cast a spell of light and found that he was indeed in his room in the knight commander's castle.  
Wordlessly, Daeran went to the kitchen, and drank an unhealthy amount of coffee.

  
Caemilla:

The half-elf's eyes gleamed as she slowly stalked closer and closer to her prey, a little elf, no older than 13.  
She smiled, and raised her knife high, and-  
The knife bounced?  
""Silly Caemilla! After the commander ascended, he changed the rules a bit. Now knives can only cut food!""  
The half-elf's eyes darted around paranoid, before dropping the knive and trying to strangle the boy with her bare hands.  
She was sent flying back by a telepathic field.  
""Silly! Now everyone has a telepathic field that stops anyone from hurting them unwillingly.""  
Caemilla began to gasp uneasily, and pulled out a hand-crossbow, and fired it at him.  
The arrow bounced off.  
Caemilla backed away, and looked around in abject horror.  
People eating pie, cake, bacon, smiling, laughter, dancing, not a scream in sight!!  
The half-elf ran away in horror, and went to Horgus gwerm's new home.  
Horgus was hugging his wife, as it turns out, dying was also not a thing anymore.  
Caemilla started having a panic attack, terrified by this perfect reality.  
""Caemilla, what's wrong?""  
Caemilla woke up, and let out one scream.  
""EVERYTHING!""



....

Wenduag:

...  
...  
...

Wenduag was surrounded by dead corpses, multiple armies defeated surrounded her, the very sky was turning black as the ever-present song of the abyss hummed.

She was being held by the neck by the swarm-that-walks, the commander she once called master, now sent a cloud of locusts to crawl down her throat, and devour her from the inside.  
But that wasn't enough, one more degration presented itself.  
The swarm leaned in, and whispered in Wenduag's ear.

""....You can't do anything.""

Wenduag hissed as she awoke, baring her fangs at an unseen foe.  
Nothing.  
Grumbling, Wenduag turned over and went back to bed.

  
Ember:

The knight commander and his allies were sitting at a table, discussing grim matters.

""We cannot let this insult stand, we declare war on Mendev! They will regret ever saying the chosen of Iomadae was a fraud!""

Ember was horrified by this prospect, so she entered the room and shyly tried to perk up.

""B-But the people are our friends, why would we want to wage war on our friends?""  
The commander barely even looked at her.  
""Ember, go screw off! We're doing serious grown-up stuff, go play with those blocks I got you.""  
Ember quieted for a bit, but hearing the commander go on was terrible for her, hearing him say scary things like ""Burn their farms"" and ""Slaughter every guard"" made her tear up and try to speak up.  
""I don't want-""  
""What did I say, Ember?! Now go and play before you make me mad! I'm killing those fools no matter what you say!""  
""B-But you are my best friend, and don't best friends listen to eachother?""  
""I'm not your friend, Ember! I'm your begrudging caretaker! Guards? Take her to her room, and make sure she stays there.""  
Ember cried as 2 sturdy and stoic guards grabbed her by the arms and pulled her to her room, before locking the door with a simple spell.  
And despite the closed door and distant hallway, the words ""Phyyric victory"", and ""I will be the only lord."", and ""Kill them all!"", she could still hear.

The dream faded out, and Ember began crying in the real world, tears streaming down the young Elf's face.  
Seeking comfort, Ember pitter-pattered down the hall, and into the room of a random companion who's door wasn't locked.  
It was Lann.  
Tears still filling her eyes though not falling as much, Ember poked Lann to awaken him.  
Lann groaned something about 5 minutes, but when he saw the wet eyes of the little girl, he changed his tune.  
""Oh- Oh, hey, little one. What's wrong?""  
""A-A- Are- are... Are we-""  
""Breath.""  
""....Are we going to wage war with Mendev, and kill everybody there?""  
""Of course not, they are our closest allies, why?""  
""Because I had a dream that my best friend, \[commander\], told me we were going to fight the people in mendev so he could be their lord...""

Lann was confused, how had they both had nightmares at the same time?

Lann calmed Ember down and helped her go back to bed, then he returned to sleep too.

  
.......

In the morning, they all got an answer.

By the collar, Irabeth dragged in a lanky pale man wearing a purple robe.  
As it turns out, he was a cultist of the goddess of nightmares, who helped her place a curse over the castle to send everyone sleeping there into nightmares hand-crafted by the goddess herself.

And after that man was executed, their sleep was never more restful.",2,1754128241.0,Pathfinder_Kingmaker,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The features of a cross body quilted bag determine its functionality, durability, and overall appeal.

**Material Quality**

The material used is crucial for a bag’s longevity and aesthetics. High-quality materials like genuine leather or meticulously crafted synthetic alternatives contribute to a premium feel and can withstand daily wear and tear. The quilting itself plays a meaningful role; tightly stitched patterns not only enhance the bag’s visual appeal but also ensure the internal padding remains evenly distributed, preventing sagging and maintaining the bag's shape over time. Many contemporary quilted bags feature water-resistant coatings, adding another layer of protection for your belongings and extending the bag’s lifespan.

**Size and Compartments**

The ideal size depends on your daily needs. A smaller bag, around 8-10 inches in width and 6-8 inches in height, is perfect for carrying essentials like a phone, wallet, and keys. Larger bags,ranging from 10-14 inches wide and 8-12 inches high,offer more space for items like a small tablet,water bottle,or makeup bag. The interior compartments are equally critically important; multiple pockets, zippered sections, and organizational slots can definitely help keep your belongings tidy and easily accessible. A dedicated phone pocket and a key clip are valuable additions for added convenience.

The strap is a vital component that affects comfort and versatility. An adjustable strap, typically ranging from 20 to 24 inches in drop length, allows you to customize the fit for different body types and carrying preferences.

Padded straps offer additional comfort, making them ideal for extended wear. Some designs feature detachable straps, allowing the bag to be used as a clutch or shoulder bag, increasing its adaptability.

**Closure Mechanism and Security**

The closure mechanism ensures the safety of your belongings. Zipper closures are generally the most secure,preventing accidental openings and deterring theft. Magnetic snap closures offer easier access but may not be as secure in crowded environments. Flap closures with a twist-lock or buckle provide a balance of security and convenience. internal zippered pockets are a valuable addition for storing valuables like cash or credit cards. Reinforced stitching around the closure area enhances its durability and prevents premature wear.

**Quilting Pattern and Design**

The quilting pattern substantially contributes to the bag's aesthetic appeal. Classic diamond quilting remains a timeless choice, offering a complex and elegant look. Chevron quilting provides a more modern and dynamic feel. Other patterns, like floral or geometric designs, can add a unique and personalized touch. The stitching quality is crucial; even and consistent stitching ensures the quilting remains intact and prevents fraying. The overall design, including the hardware and embellishments, should complement the quilting pattern and reflect your personal style.

I don’t know how to explain it. This movie touched my soul. And I genuinely don’t understand how this is labeled a kids movie. It is not. It is about life and death and meaning and feeling lost in your own existence.

As cliché as this may sound, so many people go through times where they don’t want to live. Not necessarily in a dramatic way, but in a quiet “what is the point” kind of way. We start believing that we can’t truly live until we find our purpose. That everything depends on discovering some big “spark”.

But Soul says your spark isn’t your purpose. Maybe your spark is eating pizza. Feeling the ocean. Watching the sunrise. Finishing a book. Breathing in the smell of coffee. Sitting in silence. These  can be enough. They can be the reason you live.

Joe Gardner literally dies and refuses to stay dead. He fights his way back to Earth because he thinks his life hasn’t started yet. He finally gets the gig of his dreams. Playing jazz. And in that moment he thinks this is it! This is when life begins. But it doesn’t feel like that. And that hit me.

We all say stuff like when I graduate my life will start. When I get my dream job. When I move out. We are always waiting for life to start. Always aiming for a destination. But we forget the in between. We forget to live while we chase.

And then one day we finally arrive where we always wanted to be and it’s like “now what?”Because we didn’t stop to feel the tiny ordinary things. We were so busy climbing. Proving. Chasing. And we forgot to just… be.

The meaning of life is just to be ALIVE.

Why does it take facing death to finally start living? “The meaning of life comes from death”. That line hit me.

Why do we only start to really feel the value of something when we lose it or when we are about to. I have noticed this in myself. I don’t realize how precious something is until it is gone. A person. A moment. It is only in the absence that I suddenly see the beauty of what I had.

I don’t want it to always be like that. I don’t want to keep needing loss to understand value. I don’t want that realization to come after it is too late.

So maybe that is the reminder. Don’t wait for something to be gone to appreciate it. Don’t wait for life to fall apart to start living.",1,1754128199.0,DisneyMovies,0,1.0,False

‘*Oh my God! I'm not dead!*’

Luke thought to himself as he eats his food, it seems that Vina is not actually harboring murderous intent towards him. In fact, she looks really happy, very happy, he has no clue why though.

“This isn't the best place but… i guess it's enough”

He commented on the tavern they are having dinner in. It's cozy if he has to say something about it, other than that he’s got nothing, it's just good.

“Thank you for this…”

She said with a smile. Luke’s a bit scared, he has never seen her smile this much. They've known each other for like a week, but still.

“You certainly look really happy, I'm glad you are, though… why so sudden?”

“Hmm? Oh… that… I guess I just never… have someone treat me this way?”

‘*what*’

“Other than my father… but it's still every once in a forever with him”

Luke thinks about that for a bit, and… he’s got nothing, what does she mean by that?

“Oh, so like… you… never eat in a place like this?”

“Not like that, it's just that… someone being so nice to me is… new”

“.....”

Luke couldn't say anything.

“I’ve been thinking about it, you were right, I haven't smiled at all these last 7 days haven’t i?”

“Yeah, at least… a genuine one, y’know?”

“Yes, a genuine smile, well… thank you”

She smiled, again, she meant it.

“Your welcome i guess”

“Do you do this a lot in your world?”

“What exactly?”

“Being so nice?”

He hesitated to answer. Truth is not really, but it's not like he doesn't want to do that, he just can’t, but here? With the recent trade success he had?

“Not always… my mom used to say to me… if you can do something good, just do it, she said that doing good because you know you can is what i should always do… and i- heh… i’m a Mama's boy so yeah”

“She’s a good mother”

“Yeah, she is…”

Luke's gaze wandered off, he looked into the distance, thinking about her words.

‘*......Something new to her?*’

Vina finished her meal, Luke had finished his way earlier, safe to say he was hungry after skipping lunch and training all day.

“You improved a lot you know?”

“Me?”

“Yes, in one day you went from one afternoon with Kottar, coming back looking like a dead body, and now a whole day of practice, and you came back running”

“Oh that, yeah… hahaha! Told ya i’d get used to it!”

“I guess you did… let's go back to the inn, it's getting very late”

“Sure…”

Suddenly, Luke felt compelled to ask her something.

“…wait”

“Hmm?”

“Can I ask you something?”

“Go on…”

“Why aren't you mad?”

“What?”

“About today… I promised you lunch and uh…”

“I told you it's fine”

“Yeah, but why?”

“.....”

“Hmm?”

“I guess… I just wasn't expecting much”

“Oh…”

“But… after this I… I just want more, selfish I know”

Luke smirked.

“Heh, aight-aight, remind me to take you out for dinner from time to time”

“Not like that, don't blow money on me”

“Hey, its good stuff, I reckon you get bored of porridge everyday too no?”

“I suppose I do… let's go back”

As they both left the tavern, Luke wondered, what is he gonna be in this world? Just a weirdly rich guy who does quests with Vina? Is he going to be something more? He can’t tell, he supposed… time would show the way.

—-~----

(4 days later)

‘*officially… Day 12?... Ish*’

Luke thought to himself as he looked up at the night sky above. He’s supposed to be sleeping right now, it’s about midnight and Vina is already dead asleep. 

But he’s going through that weird phase of being so tired it looped back to being not tired, kind of. He’s been training for almost the whole day for 4 days straight now, and he’s getting better and better everyday.

Though, it did have a side effect, his body aches so much he can't even sleep. There is something else he noticed quite recently as well, as in like a minute ago.

“Mmm…”

He watched the moon shine above him, barely shrouded by the clouds. It is beautiful, bigger than earth’s moon, and with only natural clouds to cover it and not industrial smog infused clouds, it is much brighter. 

It was much easier to see, which also meant he can easily notice how much faster it’s actually moving.

“Weird….”

It’s fast, he used to moonwatch like this every time he overdoses on coffee back home, and he does not remember the moon moving that fast. 

“Hmmm….”

Cogs turned quite hard in his brain for a moment, before it clicked on him. Day and night cycle must be shorter in this world, which must've been messing with his sleep schedule (like he had one at all).

“Eh…”

He returned to his chair, to try sleeping again. He should've expected this really, it’s a whole different world, different universe, not just a different planet. 

May not be so different on that aspect either, he’s been thinking about it, what if this place is straight up just earth? But oh well, it’s time to sleep, there's always time to think in the morning.

—-~----

“So… like usual?”

“Yeah… go outside the wall, train my ass off, buy some lunch, train, train, go back to the inn, sleep, repeat”

Luke spoke to Vina in a half interested tone as he bit down on a sandwich. They're in their room, preparing themselves for today’s many challenges, which is really not that much nor is it that serious.

“Got it all laid out? Good for you, reminds me of something”

“Oh yeah? What is it?”

“I used to train all day long with my father, no matter the weather, we always have a schedule, a tight one, do this, then that, then this, that again… you know what i mean”

“Oh? Why do you train though?”

“So I can be a huntress!”

She points to herself with a smile and a kind of pride he has never seen on her before. 

Not that he knows her for that long but still. She is basically an introvert as far as he can tell, he genuinely has never seen her make any kind of conversation with other people unless she needs to. 

Literally the only time he’s seen her talk to anyone other than him was when they were going around asking for the cheap inn.

“I guess you did it?”

Her smile vanished.

“No…”

“Eh? Why?”

“I…”

Her eyes wander off somewhere else.

“I don't want to talk about it”

“Alright, not gonna bug you then… so you’re just going to watch me again today right?”

“Mhmm… not like i can do anything else, the last few days has been… plain”

“Okay good, cause i actually want you to watch me today”

“Oh really? Why?”

“Kottar says today’s the day for a test, like… serious test, not just sparring and allat”

“Oh… are you sure you’re not going to get… What do you say…? Getting your… ass beat?”

“Nah, i’d win today, just watch, i’ve been training myself in my spare time*

Vina chuckled.

“Somehow I doubt that…”

“Well you’re gonna be proven wrong today! Just watch!”

She smirked, she pulled out her dagger to use it as a mirror as she oh so smugly combs her “hairdo” (furdo?)

“Hah!... You’re not going to make it, why do you think the test is so early?”

“Because- uh… I actually don't… why?”

“This is standard flow of teaching Luke, I've been through it, he’ll make you anticipate a test and give it to you early so you’re excited, that's when they're going to be very serious, to keep your expectations in check, you know?... To be realistic?”

“You're saying I'm going to get pummeled today?”

“Pretty much… After that he’ll put you through more, give you more tests, going easier and easier each time, get you confident again, after that… the tests will actually be serious again, to keep you on your toes, all the ones before that? Just simple conditioning, that's all”

“How do you know this?”

“Oh please… my father’s an expert at it, trust me, i’ve been through it ever since i can hold a bow”

Luke thinks about it, she’s right, there's a good chance he'd get folded.

“.....”

“What? Lost your spirit?”

“....nah, it’s fine, i mean i kinda been through it as well, though i guess fighting with an Axe is different than being a janitor”

“Being a what?”

“I’ll explain later”

She giggled, before letting out a sigh, while smiling, weirdly enough.

“Sometimes I forget you’re from another world…”

“Hmm? How so?”

“I don't know, maybe because…. you’re unremarkable? Ahahahah!-”

“That's rude, i am offended”

He replies with a sarcastic tone. Truth is he kinda wants that, the chance that he gets ‘witch of Salem'd’ is slim but not zero, so he wants to keep it a secret for now. 

He could only smile as Vina kept laughing, his first time seeing her like this, he wouldn't mind seeing it again.

“Alright-alright! stop laughing, let's go meet Kottar, he must be waiting for me”

Her laugh subsided slowly, it came down to just giggles, but she wouldn't stop giggling either.

‘*maybe i should add autistic on top of introvert*’

Luke thought, as he rolled his eyes with a smile.

—-~----

They arrived at the training spot, Kottar was there, sitting next to a campfire enjoying a bowl of soup. Luke told Vina some time ago that it’s apparently Kottar's special family recipe.

“Yo! Coach!”

“So early, why?”

“What's wrong with that?”

He glanced at Vina.

“Fancy seeing you here, usually you’re up on the wall”

“You need someone to count don’t you?”

“Fair… so, are you ready?”

“Hell yeah! Let's go now!”

“no, we’ll start…”

He looks at the “arena”, at the many broken sticks and fallen leaves that are stuck on the mud. 

“When you clean that, might as well use it to warm up”

“Oh what? Why?”

“Because i’ve got an axe to dull down and soup to eat, now go”

“Aww…”

Vina crossed her arms and smirked as Luke sadly walked away towards the arena to clean it up. 

“Good luck~”

Kottar glances at her again.

“You’re not from around here, yes?”

He asked, for some reason she couldn't answer it, all she could do was a slight nod.

“We're the same then, so why are you here?”

“....”

She couldn't bear doing the same, to look him in the eye as they speak, she just can't, unlike Luke.

“just… just like most people here”

“A refugee, got it”

“Hm?”

“You know? The little war going on to the south? People are flooding inwards from there, something-something rogue mancer if i’m not wrong”

“Necro…”

“Necromancer, no wonder! That kind of person can summon an army anywhere, magic’s scary don't you think?”

“yes… yes…”

She speaks like she didn't pay attention, she didn't, all her attention is on Luke, who is cleaning up the arena with a bitter face. 

Even now, after some time together, it still feels so strange, what made him so different? She wondered, not knowing if she’ll ever know, nor if she would understand it or not if she did.

—-~----

“Ready?”

“Ready!” 

Vina stood next to the arena, Kottar and Luke stood in the arena facing each other, each with an Axe in hand. Or Axes, Kottar has a knack for dual wielding light and small Axes. 

Luke's choice from the start is a heavy two handed Axe. Unwise if you ask her, Kottar has the advantage of using a lighter weapon, not to mention he’s used to it.

“Ooh… hold on”

Seeing Luke struggle to even grip his Axe properly tells her this is going to be very short, just like yesterday, and the days before that.

“Zero to zero…”

“Be our mark, yes? When you think we’re ready, shout go or something”

“Sure, not sure he’s ready though”

She pointed at Luke, he raised an eyebrow.

“I’m offended!”

He meant it this time.

“Hm! Whatever you say Luke… Begin!”

“Woah! Hey! Ow!”

Kottar stepped in really quick, and smacked Luke's knee with the side of his Axe. It's dull, but it can still hurt.

“Zero to one”

“I was not ready!”

“Yes you are”

“No i ain’t! i don't even know how many hits i need!”

“Best of five, let us start again”

“Still zero to one, just saying~”

“Hmph!... Alright… just watch”

“Begin!”

Kottar didn't immediately go in this time, now that Luke's actually paying attention. 

They start to walk in a circle, eyes looking around for a gap. Kottar found it first, he dived in, parrying Luke’s Axe with one of his own and smacking him on the shoulder with the other.

“Zero to two”

Luke slapped himself in the face, she can't find a single reason why he would be doing that, but he’s slapping himself. 

“Begin!”

Circling again, Luke charged first this time. He managed to parry both of Kottar's Axes with the handle, but before he could swing Kottar recovered and redirected his swing, before promptly smacking him on the side of the head.

“Zero to three”

“Nice one, but too close, make some space”

Suddenly she feels a small part of her fur get heavier, she rubs it, it’s wet. Just as she figured that out, rain came pouring down. She took cover under a tree, but Luke and Kottar are still in the arena. Luke is staring at the mud for some reason.

“It’s fine! we can continue”

“Hm… ready? Begin!”

Luke stood still oddly enough, Kottar was about to go in circles again before he stopped. The two stared each other down for a solid minute before Kottar dashed forward. 

Luke, in response, stomped on the ground, creating a splash of muddy water that hit Kottar on the face. He couldn't see, but she could, and she watched as Luke sidestepped away from a blinded Kottar and… hit him in the ass.

‘*oh, he’s dead*’

“One to three”

Kottar wiped the mud off his face, looked at Luke and smiled. 

“Oh, you dirty…”

“No one said it’s gotta be clean”

Luke lifted his shoulder as he laughed a little and took some steps back to make distance.

“I like that, you learned”

“Ready? Begin!”

She has to admit, Luke has some spirit. It’s just odd to her that he really wants to do this, not like there's anything wrong with living without knowing how to fight. 

But he wants to fight, and he certainly could now, was it a second wind or the rain she doesn't know, but Luke was suddenly an expert at parrying. 

Kottar was aggressive this time, didn't go anywhere however, as Luke was just as aggressive in his parry play.

“Ugh!”

“Two to three”

“Good one”

“Thank… you…”

Impressive, he's still going to lose though, if his rapid breathing is any clue, he’s not built for this.

“Begin”

Another circle, but slower, which erupted into a clash between Axe heads as both charged at the same time. Sparks and a little bit of light come off them as they collide, so much so she thought the Axes sharpened themselves again. 

Both were quick, Kottar especially, for his size being that nimble is impressive. Luke wasn't so much, he’s fast, but nothing impressive, he can barely keep up.

“Agh!…”

“YOW!!!”

Well that's a surprise, Kottar had managed to smack Luke on the knee again, but Luke also managed to hit Kottar's head, accidentally it seems.

“Uh…”

She doesn't know how to count that.

“That's two! One for each!”

Kottar shouted to her.

“Hm… Three to four… Begin!”

This time both stood still, as focused as they can be. A moment passed by quickly before Kottar charged, all of her attention is on him, so when both of his axes were smacked away out of his hand she was just as surprised as him. 

Luke reacted quickly enough to parry the overhead, though he didn't seem to expect to disarm Kottar like that.

“Four to four… *Is this man really going to?...*”

“Whoa…”

“Heh… isn’t that something?”

Kottar chuckled as he picked his weapons back up.

‘*Is this man actually doing it?*’

“No way… I mean- Begin!”

As soon as she finished, Luke charged. Kottar, who was still pondering about what happened a moment ago, reacted slightly too late, and received a blunt Axe head to the stomach.

“Five to four…. Huh…”

“AHAHA YEAAAAHHH!!!”

Luke shouted in celebration, threw his Axe in the air to God knows where, and hugged Kottar.

“Easy! Easy!”

“Huh? Oh… sorry, ehm!…”

“Huh… so… you did it!”

“I did? YEE-”

“The first one”

“Oh… yeah, right…”

“but you still did it, and first try, I think you’ve got something going on for you”

Kottar patted Luke’s shoulder, a glint of pride in his eyes, it seems like he really is into this.

“Oh yeah? Hey Vina! See? Or- or hear or whatever! Hear what he said!? I told you I can do it!”

“Congratulations… you passed the first test...”

She clapped slowly.

“You told me I was going to lose! Well I didn't! Hah!”

“Well aren’t you proud?... That was good Luke, but don't celebrate too soon, that was just one of many”

“Heheheh… She's right, you know? I wasn't even being very serious”

“Ah whatever! I'm still proud!”

“Good, because we’ll continue in a few days, i need to take a break”

“Oh… what?”

“These old hands need some rest, I'm old, you know? May not look it but i am”

Luke is suddenly curious.

“Oh, how old?”

Kottar hesitated to answer, but he answered with a smile regardless.

“I have a grandchild, a couple actually”

“.....”

“.....”

“What?”

There was silence for a few minutes as Luke tried to process such a news, then Vina laughed loudly.

“You won against a grandpa! HAHA!-”

“Wha- hey! I didn't know that! I didn't hit you too hard didn't I?”

“These old bones are still holding!”

“Wait! Where’s your son then? Or daughter or whatever?”

“Both, i’m… trying to find them, they've been wanderers since they're young, they left me and our clan behind long ago, to explore they said, to be more”

“Oh… well that's good right?”

“I suppose, yes… but I miss them. The last thing I heard was that my daughter had herself a healthy little boy, i… really wanted to see them, I mean… *really* want to, but i don't know where they are”

“Hey!”

She called out to both of them.

“I know you two are having a moment… but being in the rain for too long isn't healthy”

—-~----

“Where do you think his kids are?”

Luke asked Vina as they walked back to the inn.

“Probably not kids anymore”

“That's obvious, where do you think they are?”

“I don't know, could be anywhere, i’ve heard about wandering orcs… they are… something like outliers, most orcs like to stay in nomadic clans, they can build cities, they have the power and resource for it, they just don't want it”

“Orcs are nomadic?”

“Yes, Luke, it’s been like that since forever… I think, maybe, i don't know much”

That's a bit odd, Luke thought, she seems to know a lot about Nivaria, but she’s unsure of it.

“Who taught you that?”

“My father, obviously, he knows a lot more than me”

“Is he still… you know?”

“Alive? Yes, very much”

“Oh, why aren’t you with him then?”

“He… he wants me to live alone”

He looked at her, he’s a bit confused.

“Eh? Why? I mean I get it, I guess I did that too, but you’re just out here…. I just remembered… I can't believe I haven't asked this yet, why are you here?”

“i’m here just like everyone who got here in the last few days, refugee”

“Oh… from the war?”

“How do you know that?”

“Eh… just some gossip with the guys at the construction site, told me they were expanding the town a bit because so many people are coming in”

“Hmm… well it’s true, there's a lot”

“Wait, if you're avoiding that war… my question stands, why are you here by yourself?”

“I wasn't, I was with my father, then, before we arrived at a town called Fortaare, he told me I should continue without him… be out there myself… live my own life… I miss him…”

“.....”

She looks at him, not realizing her eyes were a little watery.

“Sorry, i didn't mean-”

“So you’re a daddy’s girl?”

“WHAT!!? No I'm not!”

“Sounds like you are… probably told you that cus you can't stop clinging on him”

“I-i am an independent woman!”

“I don't doubt that! i mean holy hell what you did at the forest all those days ago was fucking awesome… I'm just saying… you feel like the type of girl that can't live without someone familiar by your side”

“NO! I- i… I'm…. You’re… not wrong….”

She looks away, trying to hide her face, her shame, she doesn't understand why, he doesn't understand why, she is just as strange to him as he is to her.

“I get that, I miss my mom a lot sometimes…”

The mood starts to feel a bit gloomy, Vina doesn't like it, it makes her feel uncomfortable, she wondered… Does that make him uncomfortable too?

“When I was kid she used to…”

Is he… like her? Is that why talking to him doesn't feel as uncomfortable as many others?

“...pack my lunch and- OOH… what is that?”

Nevermind. He points at… a store, a rune store specifically, the elaborate sign and fancy construction must’ve caught his eye and hooked his childish mind.

“That's a rune store, where you commision runes to the runemaker”

“Runes? What does it do?”

“It’s a magic thing, I don't really know anything about it, I just know they're supposed to help with something, like… enhancements?”

“Enchantments? OH- Can we get that?”

“Wha- no! Do you just forget what I said to you?”

“No wasting money, I know, but it sounds cool!”

“How does something even sound cold? No, Luke, no runes!”

“Aw… please?...”

“No”

“Pretty please?...”

He made a strange face, it elicited somewhat of a pity in her, but she won’t fall for it.

“No, no, and no, why are you so childish? We don't have to get everything Luke… be realistic”

“Oh come on! It can probably help us!”

“We don't even know how it works!”

“We can ask…”

“*Sigh* you won’t budge won't you?”

“That's right!”

“Don't tell me if i still say no you’re going to go there on your own”

“Uh… no? Maybe”

“Fine… you can get runes, *but* you have to help me tomorrow, we’re taking a quest, outside where you can fight things like you wanted”

“Oh wait, really? YES- i mean… okay”

“Good, can I trust you?”

“Yes ma’am!”

“I’m serious! It’s not a game!... It’s dangerous out there! we could die! and i want to know if i can trust you to not get us to die”

“Of course you can! Just trust me!”

“Somehow I doubt that…”

“you won’t be doubting soon enough!... Hehe…”

He starts running down the path that leads to the inn, probably impatient to sleep so he can get to tomorrow as fast as possible. She can't understand him, at all, why does fighting make him excited? Can't be just for the money right? What is he even fighting for?

Fun?

That makes no sense.

“*Sigh* this man…”

She supposed it wasn't making any sense since the start, a man from another world sounds insane enough. She wondered what kind of fate struck her that day, good? Or bad? She can't tell, because nothing makes sense.

I help run an Anaheim Ducks fan community in the Europe, and we were all were confused during the weird Sam Colangelo signing/un-signing yesterday. The whole situation felt like something out of a book, so for fun, I wrote this short, fictional story about it imagining how it might have all gone down. Hope you enjoy :)

>Pat Verbeek’s office was his sanctuary—a place where the chaos of professional hockey was distilled into cold, brutal logic. The morning light cut through the window blinds, laying stark bars of shadow and sun across the floor. On his immaculate desk sat a single mug of black coffee. Next to it, a sad reminder of discipline, lay a gluten-free protein bar. Verbeek took a slow sip, and in that precise moment, the door to his world was kicked open.

>Pete Rutili, an agent whose manic energy was usually reserved for closing arguments on a contract, stormed in like a weather event. Trailing in his wake like a shadow was his client, Sam Colangelo.

>Verbeek placed the mug down without a sound. His eyes slid past the agent’s furious face and landed on the player. ""Next time you feel the need to burst in here, Pete, make sure you're representing a player worth getting fired over.""

>Rutili ignored the jab, shoving his phone forward like a holy relic. ""Explain this, Pat. Right now.""

>Verbeek didn’t even glance at the screen. ""I see a news story. Says one of my players is staying with my team. Seems logical to me.""

>""He's not your player! Not for that garbage offer!"" Rutili seethed. ""We're filing a grievance with the PA!""  
""Yeah!"" a muffled voice echoed from behind the agent’s shoulder.

>A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched Verbeek’s lips. ""You can go cry to the Players' Association. You can take out a full-page ad in the paper. But let me remind you of something, Pete."" He leaned back, his chair giving a slight groan. ""A few months ago, I traded Trevor Zegras. I carved the beating, media-darling heart out of this franchise to prove that no one is bigger than the team. Do you honestly believe I'm going to lose sleep over an angry email from some union lawyer about a kid who got hot for one week?""

>Slowly, with deliberate laziness, he turned his monitor to face them. The admin panel of the team website was on the screen. A single, blinking cursor hovered over the word ""Delete.""

>""I value your time. So let's end this circus.""

>Rutili froze. The offer was monstrous in its simplicity. Verbeek wasn’t just giving him what he wanted—he was forcing him to pull the trigger himself, turning a victory into an act of self-immolation. His professional instincts screamed that it was a trap. He looked at the button, and his resolve began to melt.

>In that second of hesitation, Colangelo, fueled by the raw, thoughtless courage of youth, lunged forward.

>""Screw you!""

>His hand shot out, shoving his agent’s aside. His finger slammed down on the mouse. A single, dry click echoed in the silent office. On the screen, the news post vanished. Colangelo stood there, panting, tasting the bitter triumph.

>Verbeek watched him, his expression unchanged. He had anticipated this. He understood the empty, boyish rebellion. But he did not accept it.

>""Well,"" he said, his calm voice slicing through the tension. ""You've got heart, kid. Too bad that's all you've got.""

>He took another sip of his coffee as if to punctuate the thought.

>""I could have just buried you in the AHL. That would have been simple. But now, I’m feeling creative. I'm going to trade you to Florida. You can have your glorious five minutes a night on the fourth line, blocking shots with your teeth and watching real hockey players from the bench. And when they get sick of your face, you'll finish out your worthless contract in Charlotte until everyone forgets your name. You'll just fade out, kid.""

>He gestured toward the door. ""Now get out of my office.""

>As Rutili and his now-toxic asset reached the threshold, Verbeek’s voice followed them, devoid of all emotion.

>""By the way,"" he said. ""That was the most obvious play in the book. Number one of fifty. I guess now we'll have to try number two.""",0,1754127449.0,AnaheimDucks,2,0.5,False

This would explain a few things, like why civilians with out masks and seaf soldiers run into their holes for no reason some times.. it happens a lot more with civilians (this isn't a bug, apparently they are path noded to do that.)

  
And it would explain why a lot of super earth settlements become bug holes. The bugs are using their spores and pheromones to mess with the minds of those who do not have masks. This makes them see a bug hole as safety. Which leads to them giving themselves to the bugs... willingly, while trying to run from the bugs.

\------

I am just thankful that all it seems to be is biomass collection so to speak. lure things in for food. one can hope the bugs never get smart enough to use it for other purposes.

  
Granted it would be fun to see infested civilians in gloom bug cities. Imagine them covered in spores, with terminid mines on them, acting as suicide bombs for the bugs. they are just looking for safety. they see you they rush you thinking they are going to escape only for the mines on their back to detonate showering you with acid and their guts.

They say that the seasons come and go. But why did the summer never seem to stay long enough, no matter how long it lasted? It was never too warm, never too bright. Just perfect. Summer was a time of happiness and life. I loved the way the sun's rays traced over my skin, how it filled my heart with love and warmth.. Nothing like winter. I hate the cold. I hate the empty skies. When winter comes all the joy in the world seems to disappear. And every year, the winter feels longer than the last

I set my coffee down onto the windowsill and gazed through the glass. It seemed like all I did as of late was to look up at the sky. The sun had began setting earlier than usual today. That time of the year. Again. One last glance outside, where orange leaves filtered sunlight through a broken canopy and into my eyes.

Outside my home stretched a vast field- the most breathtaking meadow one could imagine. Tallgrass swayed from one end of the horizon to the other, with birds of all kinds gliding from treetop to treetop. Serenity. We chose our home well, but winter would come soon. And It felt like the right time to take my yearly walk.

Today was the last day I'd get to wear a sundress for a while, after all.

I hesitated before pushing the door open, bracing for cold winds to rush in. But upon mustering the courage to, I'd found that it was still somewhat warm out. The sky seemed clearer than it had in days. I mouthed a quiet ""Thank you,"" up at the setting sun before beginning my walk.

The path I always took through the fields had faded away again this year. It was getting harder for me to see it, but it would always be there. I'd never forget it. I tread through the grass, surrounded by wildflowers. Damn flowers. They always made me tear up. And as I got closer to my destination they seemed to spring up out of nowhere. Flowers, flowers and more flowers. Clouds had already begun to blot out the sun, but no rain would fall. Not yet. Not while the sun was still up.

Everywhere I looked reminded me of when the skies were bright and the oceans hadn't begun to freeze over. When the sun was still around, and everything felt right in the world. When the trees were still green and the lovebirds still sang their song. A time when I could bask in the sun forever and snowflakes never fell from the moon.

The journey always felt long. Every moment I spent trudging down this trail was a bitter one- memories from a time long past lit up the corners of my mind. Of smiles left behind. And yet it always stirred a feeling in my heart the way only the sun could.

Before long, I'd reached the end of the path. In front of me lay an ancient, gnarled and blackened stump. I once thought it was ugly. But over the years I'd come around to understanding what made it so beautiful. I knelt and traced my fingers over its rough surface, gazing upon it with a soft reverence. Still etched onto its bark, now and forevermore was a reminder of better days.

Memories of a summer long gone once again filled my mind. The sun was almost gone by now. Soon a dark sky full of stars and an empty moon would take its place. And yet, the world still felt warm. It made me feel tired. Gingerly, I eased myself down onto the stump with a sigh as the sun finally slipped below the horizon.

I glanced over to my right. There was just enough space for the two of us to sit. Yet it had been empty for years now.

The only thing that the sun had left behind was a bit of warmth on its surface- Just enough to make me feel like it was summer all over again.

A cold wind slipped through the air, brushing strands of my hair away from my eyes as rain finally spilled from the moon.

[[Browse top-rated remote control outlet on Amazon]](https://itsallgarden.com/baby-care/?kw=remote+control+outlet)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The top remote control outlets of 2025 offer a range of features designed to enhance convenience and efficiency.

**Wireless Range:** This is a critical factor determining the flexibility of the outlet.

The best models boast an extended wireless range of up to 100 feet in open space, allowing users to control devices from anywhere in their home. This range typically decreases with obstructions like walls and furniture, but premium outlets utilize advanced radio frequency (RF) technology to maintain a reliable connection even through multiple walls. Some models also incorporate Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling control from anywhere with an internet connection via a smartphone app.

**Power Capacity:** The maximum wattage and voltage the outlet can handle are crucial for safety and functionality.

Most remote control outlets are designed to handle a standard load of 120V and 15A, supporting up to 1800 watts. This capacity is suitable for most household appliances, including lamps, fans, and small electronics. However, it’s essential to check the power requirements of specific devices, especially those with heating elements like space heaters or hair dryers, to ensure they don’t exceed the outlet’s capacity. Overloading the outlet can lead to overheating and potential fire hazards.

**Remote Control Type:** Different technologies offer varying levels of control and convenience.

Remote control outlets primarily use RF or Wi-Fi technology. RF remotes offer simple on/off control and typically have a longer range compared to infrared (IR) remotes. Wi-Fi-enabled outlets provide more advanced features, such as scheduling, timer functions, and voice control integration with smart home assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. Some models also offer a combination of RF and Wi-Fi, providing a backup control option in case of internet connectivity issues.

**Smart Home Integration:** Compatibility with popular smart home platforms is a significant advantage.

Many of the top remote control outlets seamlessly integrate with popular smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit. This integration allows users to control their devices using voice commands, create automated routines, and monitor energy consumption through a centralized smart home app. The level of integration varies between models, with some offering more advanced features like IFTTT (If This Then That) support for creating custom automation scenarios.

**Energy Monitoring:** Some models provide insights into energy consumption, promoting efficiency.

Select remote control outlets feature built-in energy monitoring capabilities, providing real-time and historical data on the power consumption of connected devices. This data can be accessed through a smartphone app or web interface, allowing users to identify energy-hogging appliances and make informed decisions about energy conservation. Some models also provide alerts when a device is consuming an unusually high amount of power, potentially indicating a malfunction.

**Safety Features:** Overload protection and surge protection are essential for protecting devices.

Premium remote control outlets incorporate several safety features, including overload protection, surge protection, and fire-resistant materials. Overload protection automatically shuts off the outlet if the connected device exceeds the maximum power capacity, preventing overheating and potential fire hazards. Surge protection safeguards devices from voltage spikes caused by lightning strikes or power surges. Fire-resistant materials help to contain any potential fires and prevent them from spreading.

 ## Core Benefits

Remote control outlets offer a variety of benefits that enhance convenience, energy efficiency, and home security.

**Enhanced Convenience:** The ability to control devices remotely simplifies daily tasks and improves overall convenience.

Imagine turning on the lights before you enter a room, switching off appliances from the comfort of your bed, or preheating a coffee maker before you wake up. Remote control outlets make these scenarios a reality, eliminating the need to physically reach for switches and buttons. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with mobility issues or those who want to control hard-to-reach devices.

**Energy Savings:** By easily turning off devices when not in use, remote control outlets help reduce energy consumption and lower electricity bills.

Many electronic devices continue to draw power even when they are turned off, a phenomenon known as phantom load or vampire power. Remote control outlets allow you to completely cut off power to these devices, preventing energy waste and saving money on your electricity bill. Scheduling features further enhance energy savings by automatically turning off devices during periods of inactivity.

**Improved Home Security:** Remote control outlets can be used to create the illusion that someone is home, deterring potential burglars.

By setting lights to turn on and off at specific times, you can create the impression that your home is occupied, even when you are away on vacation. This simple measure can significantly enhance your home security and provide peace of mind. Some smart outlets also integrate with security systems, allowing you to control lights and appliances remotely in response to security events.

**Increased Accessibility:** Remote control outlets provide easier access to devices for individuals with mobility limitations.

For individuals with disabilities or mobility issues, reaching for switches and outlets can be challenging. Remote control outlets provide a convenient and accessible way to control devices without requiring physical exertion. Voice control integration further enhances accessibility, allowing users to control devices using simple voice commands.

**Simplified Automation:** They facilitate the creation of automated routines and schedules for various devices.

Smart remote control outlets enable you to create automated routines and schedules for your devices, streamlining your daily life and enhancing convenience. For example, you can set your lights to turn on automatically at sunset, your coffee maker to start brewing at a specific time, or your air conditioner to turn on before you arrive home. These automated routines can be easily customized to suit your individual needs and preferences.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about remote control outlets.

**Are remote control outlets safe to use?**

Yes, remote control outlets are generally safe to use as long as they are used within their specified power capacity and have built-in safety features like overload protection and surge protection. It's crucial to choose reputable brands that adhere to safety standards and avoid overloading the outlets with devices that exceed their wattage limit.

**Can I use remote control outlets outdoors?**

No, standard remote control outlets are designed for indoor use only. Using them outdoors can expose them to moisture and extreme temperatures, which can damage the device and create a safety hazard. However, there are outdoor-rated remote control outlets specifically designed for use in outdoor environments. These outlets are typically weatherproof and can withstand exposure to rain, snow, and sunlight.

**How many devices can I control with one remote?**

The number of devices you can control with one remote depends on the type of remote control outlet. RF remotes typically have a limited number of channels, allowing you to control a specific number of outlets. Wi-Fi-enabled outlets, on the other hand, can often control an unlimited number of devices through a smartphone app or web interface. Some models also allow you to group outlets together and control them simultaneously.

**Do remote control outlets work with LED lights?**

Yes, remote control outlets are compatible with LED lights. LED lights consume significantly less power than traditional incandescent bulbs, making them ideal for use with remote control outlets. However, it's important to choose LED bulbs that are compatible with dimming functions if you plan to use them with a dimmable remote control outlet.

Please help me understand if I overreacted or if this is reasonable.

My wife F32 had a birthday yesterday. I had asked several times what she wanted to do for her birthday. She always answered ""nothing special"". When we woke up on her birthday, I suggested we have brunch at a restaurant. I suggested one place but she wanted to go to another restaurant (which she knows I'm tired of going to) but we went there of course.

She got gifts worth 2000 - 3000 dollars. 
Her parents came over in the afternoon for coffee. D By the afternoon I was feeling tired and not having my best day to be honest. But I pulled it together but maybe wasn't the most social.

After they left, I slept for an hour and felt better after that. But then she was grumpy and said that this was one of her worse birthdays because I was so grumpy.

We had the bed between us, the basket half-empty, slumping towers of laundry softening the space.

“I know,” I said. “But it wasn’t there yesterday. I swear. That toybox – it just showed up.”

Jess didn’t look up. “We didn’t bring one in.”

“No. I mean—we didn’t. I didn’t.”

She gave a small, dry exhale. Not quite a sigh. “She’s a kid, Rob. She’s got an imagination. Like you. You feed that in her.”

I dropped the shirt I’d been folding, ran a hand over my face. “It’s not just what she said. It’s how she said it. Like she didn’t think it was strange at all.”

Jess finally met my eyes. “You’re wound tight lately. She’s playing. That’s what kids do.”

Every creak in the floorboards sounded different now, like the house was learning new ways to speak. Even if nothing had changed—except for that one, glistening black addition.

“I keep checking on her,” I muttered. “She’s always fine. Watching TV, playing with Snacks. But –”

“But?”

I paused, trying to slow my thoughts down. I’d hardly been able to work after what Win had told me, and Jess was right. I did have a big imagination.

But every creak I heard upstairs, every time Win came bounding down the steps, I felt it. The living music of the house had a different cadence. There was a wrongness I couldn’t name. Like something was just…off. And yet Win was happy. Playing with her new toy.

Milkshake.

“It’s just,” I said, “it didn’t feel like make-believe.”

“Well of course not,” she said, “because it was just a dream or something babe. Seriously. Kid’s say weird things sometimes.”

I tried not to bristle. Jess was just like this – the practical one, measured. The planner. She kept us grounded and I was glad she did. She encouraged me, she kept me hopeful. And I loved her so much for that.

But in that moment? I just wanted someone to reassure me. The same someone I shared a bed with.

“Then how do you explain the toy?”

Jess put her towel onto a pile of others, each folded straight and neat. She sighed.

“She probably found it somewhere in the house,” Jess said, “I mean, there were clearly kids living here before us. Maybe they left some of their toys laying around. Probably the same with the box.”

And then, quietly and under her breath – “You must have missed it.”

She meant the board in Win’s closet, the one with the names and dates carved into the wood. Candace and Marie. We’d found other pieces of them in the weeks after we’d fully moved in – marker scribbles on the baseboards upstairs, a pair of children’s spades behind the shed. A couple old photographs tucked away in a coat closet – two little girls with their parents all bundled up in early-90’s puffers, red-cheeked and smiling.

Those artifacts made sense to me. You live in a place long enough, you leave something behind. A sock under the bed. A feeling in the walls.  

But the snake?

Milkshake didn’t feel left behind. To me, Milkshake felt *placed*.

“I don’t know,” I said, sitting down on the edge of the bed, “I guess I just don’t like it. It was filthy.”

“So wait until she’s asleep and take it away,” Jess said, hoisting the folded towels in her arms and turning toward the closet.

“But she’s been carrying it around all day,” I said, “she’ll hate me.”

“She won’t hate you,” Jess called from the closet, muffled, “we’ll get her something else this weekend. I saw a flier at the store for a farmer’s market on Sundays – maybe we’ll find her another stuffed snake or whatever.”

“Yeah,” I said called back, taking up my shirt again.

But what I thought to myself was – *Jesus. I hope not*.

\*\*

It took until Jess was nearly asleep for me to make up my mind.

I crept, sneaking as quietly as I could, trying to remember where all the squeaking places were in the floorboards under the carpet that lined the upstairs hallway. I kept the lights out, afraid if I turned them on the splash of bright might wake up Win. I made it all the way to her room in the dark.

And then I opened the door.

The room was dark – darker than the hall. We’d brought our old black-out curtains from the apartment for her windows, covering both in case we needed to put her to bed before the sun had fully set. There wasn’t even a drop of moonlight to light my way.

After a moment I could see a little better, lingering in the doorway. Win was bundled up in her blankets, her back to me, facing the wall. Her toys were scattered about the floor, waiting for the morning. To be arranged.

I scanned them, looking for the snake. I took several long moments to look, but I couldn’t see Milkshake anywhere.

I heard Win sigh, turn around on the bed. I froze, feeling ridiculous, like a cartoon character caught snooping. My back arched, my arms up, bracing myself.

I almost giggled when I heard her sleep-breathing. Her mouth open, she was deep into her dreams. There was something so special about hearing her sleep so peacefully. I hoped then that that feeling would never go away.

But hope is a trap. Sometimes there are nasty surprises waiting in its underbelly, and the sweeter you wish, the more vile what waits underneath the other side of wanting can be.

Her breathing had a little rasp to it. I made a mental note to dust upstairs again that weekend. The house got dusty, and Win wasn’t used to such an old space. All of the grit that builds up in such a lived in place, no matter how hard you clean.

My secret joy drained just a little when I saw the other thing in Win’s bed. Of course it was there. The snake, a dark squiggle in the dark, laid out next to her, its black curves stark against her bright emerald bedsheets.

I felt stupid, I felt like I was breaking some sort of trust, sneaking into her room like that in the middle of the night. Planning to take something away from her that so very clearly gave her joy. At least, I resolved, I would get it away from her in the morning. Wash it before I took it back up to her room. I was afraid it had mold somewhere inside it, from the way it smelled. From the feel of its brittle skin.

And I was just about to turn around, about to sneak back into bed to Jess, when I heard it.

A slow, moaning creak.

I turned, fast and hard. Spinning around on the carpet, all thoughts of sneaking fleeing my mind. And I looked at the shadowed space.

At first I didn’t see anything.

Even though my eyes had adjusted to the dark, the shadows in the nook were darker still. I squinted from where I stood in the middle of the room, between the nook and Win’s bed, and looked deeper. Rats, my mind wanted to jump to rats. Old houses had rats, right?

But then I heard something else. The click of a hinge, a hollow wooden thump. The toybox lid – I was sure of it.

Yawning gently closed.   

My hand shot to my pocket, reaching for my phone. Cursing to myself when I remembered I had left it on the bedside table, plugged into the phone charger. The thought of how far away the phone was then, how naked and helpless I felt without it, made me feel limp. Isolated.

“Hello,” I called, in a whisper.

But there was only silence. It rushed in to fill the space my voice ate up, smothering it. The kind of silence that’s like white noise in and of itself. Static.

The hair on my arms stood up. A mixture of a sudden chill and a growing certainty that I was being watched. Being seen, some dull dark eyes in the dark.

“*Daddy*?”

I turned around again and saw Win sitting up in bed. The lump of her shadowed form under her blankets.

“Baby,” I said, “did you hear something?”

I thought I could make out Win shaking her head in the dark, alert. Her voice sounded muffled, almost pitched.

“*Can I turn on my nightlight Daddy?*”

I could barely see her face, but she sounded scared. Pleading. Something under it, like all the fear I felt had caught on to her. Like it was squeezing her, urgent.

“Yes baby,” I said, feeling stupid that I hadn’t thought of that myself, “please, turn it on.”

I turned back towards the nook, ready for the light to fill up the room. Ready to see whatever was waiting in there.

“*I can’t reach it Daddy*,” I heard her behind me.

I turned back to my girl. She was bundled up still, curling up farther into her blankets. I tried to smile, even though she probably couldn’t see it. To reassure her.

“It’s right by your bed sweetie,” I said, nodding. Encouraging her.

“*I’m scared*,” she said, her voice falling suddenly small. Tiny.

I shuffled over to the end of her bed. The lamp was there, on her bedside table – a Minnie Mouse lamp, her kicking form silhouetted in the blackness. The switch was her hand, and I reached for it, turning it around clockwise.

Darting my gaze back to the nook as light filled the room.

And I did see something there.

A shock of dark black hair, splayed out on the floor. Spilling through the threshold of the nook. My heart jumped, my chest hitching, as I saw it stir. Slither on the floor.

Then my dad instincts kicked in. Flowing through me right after the shock of the sight of the hair. A rage, that someone or something was in my little girl’s room. Hiding and waiting for her.

I strode over to the nook, grabbing one of Win’s tiny tennis racquets in my hand as I did – ready to club the thing to hell.

I stopped in the doorway.

Win was there, curled up in the space at the end of the nook. She was laying on her side, her back to me. Her hair splayed out behind her. The toybox, closed and dark in the shadow, stood next to her.

It was Win’s hair I’d seen.

I froze. That feeling of being watched returned to me. Pushing everything else away.

Because if Win was in the closet, who had been in her bed?

Slowly, slowly, I turned my head back to Win’s bed. My eyes falling over every inch of the room leading to it, my gaze sweeping slow. Doomed, like it was being pulled to the bed.

To whatever was waiting for me, wrapped up in the covers.

But when my eyes finally fell there, all I could see were blankets. Lumped and piled up like someone was underneath them. And, as I watched, they slumped. Fell back into themselves. Deflated.

There was nothing there in the bed. Nothing except for Win’s blankets.

And, of course, Milkshake.

I turned back to the nook, my heart bashing against my ribs, and bent over Win. Scooped her up in my hands. She moaned, half-asleep, as I lifted her up off the floor. Stepping as quick as I could with her in my arms out of the nook. Out of the bedroom.

I took her downstairs and laid her across my lap on the couch. She stirred against me, but only a little. She was still asleep, still young enough to be lifted up and away, asleep through it all. So trusting and so safe.

And I didn’t see it at first what she’d been holding. I had been so quick to get her out of that room, so quick to carry her downstairs, that I had hardly noticed the shape in her hands. But there, in the glow of the TV, I got a good look at it.

It was another toy, another crocheted shape. This one was a little girl. It was crude. The legs and arms no more than fleshy points. It had the same color scale as Milkshake – ash and boney white. All of course except for its eyes.

They were blue. Tiny sapphires in the stitched head. They caught the flickering light from the TV – shining bright and livid.  

Something about the doll rang a familiar bell in me. It couldn’t have been one of Win’s other toys, I knew that – I would never have forgotten something so worn. So wet. But at the same time…I felt like I’d seen it before.

I met the thing’s stare. Grunting. Then I reached down and took the toy from Win’s hands. Her grip relaxed, weak in sleep. I felt the toy and felt that odd cold in its fibers – just like Milkshake.

“Fuck. You,” I said, my voice hard. I threw the thing into the corner of the living room, watched it hit the wall and slide behind the armchair we had there, hearing it skitter to a stop against the baseboards.

Then, with a sigh, I hugged my girl. Hugged her close to my chest and closed my eyes tight against her. Wishing she was dreaming of something good. Something peaceful, free of worry. 

Wishing again and again.

Wishing.

\*\*

I woke up shaking. Violently.

I started, sitting straight up. Almost too fast, because Win was still asleep on my lap. When I saw her there, I froze, hugging her close to me so I didn’t knock her on the floor.

I felt the hand then, on my shoulder.

“Hey,” Jess’s voice from behind me, “*hey*.” 

I turned around, seeing her standing behind the couch. She was dressed for work, lit up from behind by the morning sun, her backpack slung over her shoulder. Her eyes were wide.

“What’s going on?” she asked.

“Shit,” I said, grimacing, “we must have fallen asleep on the couch.”

“I can see that,” Jess said, turning around fast. Too fast. An about-face.

She was pissed.

“Jess,” I called, still getting used to the bright light of morning, “*Jess*.”

She didn’t turn around, was bending over to get her shoes on. Slipping them on, pushing her heels down in them so hard they screeched against the wood floor. I winced, Win stirring in my lap. I tried to move her off of me, carefully and slowly, and I managed to get her onto the cushion beside me. I stood up, my wince deepening – sleeping like that on the couch had put a crick my back.

“Babe,” I said, “I’m sorry. She…she had a bad dream.”

I don’t know why I lied then. Maybe it was because I’d hoped that it was the truth. Not that the bad dream was Win’s, in my wish.

It had been mine.

“I woke up,” she said, hushed, her back to me still, “and I didn’t know where you were.”

“I get it,” I said, trying to reach a hand to her shoulder, in an offering. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to fall asleep, it just happened.”

Jess rejected my touch, and shrugged my hand off. I let it drop to my side, sighing. Trying not to let my sleep-soaked mind carry me to anger.

“Nothing’s wrong,” I almost whispered. “Nothing, babe.”

She stopped, going still. Her back to me. I saw her shoulders sink, by an inch. Then I saw them hitch. Heard her take a breath in, heard it catch.

And I knew what she was thinking.

A few years ago, when Win was just a toddler, I was in a bad place. I had just gotten laid off from my job during the pandemic, and my girls were all I had. Every day I was home alone with them, while Jess scrambled to support us, and my feeling of failure grew. Because – here were these two wonderful loves of mine, the lights in my sky, and as much as I loved the chance to spend time with them – I couldn’t help but feel like every day I couldn’t help get us back on our feet…that I was disappointing them. Failing them. Jess never said anything of the sort to me, and I don’t think she thought it either, but sometimes the worst thoughts we have about ourselves can build up inside us – booming echoes with nowhere to go. Bounding and reverberating through our heads all day until the pressure builds to cook. Frying our sense of reality.

I took Jess’s success for granted. The extra work she did, the more time she spent away from home, I processed as her needing more time away from me. From her loser husband, trapped at home. Win went through a hard spot herself, getting sick from the virus. She was hard to manage, and I spent a few very isolated weeks with her, Jess staying at her parents so she could still do everything she could to work to make up for our loss of income.

I spun stories in my head about the worst-case scenarios. That she was having an affair. That Win was growing to resent me, that all she would associate me with for the rest of her life was sickness. Loneliness.

And none of it was true of course. But, at the time, it felt like the truth. It was what I *wanted* to believe. Because, really, I was just punishing myself. And very unfairly.

So, one night, after Jess came back, I tried to talk to her. She was exhausted – from overworking and also the relief she felt being home at the old apartment again, I’m sure. She didn’t know what I had smoldering inside of me, the thick stew of self-loathing I’d been seeping in for weeks.

She took something I said – I can’t even remember what it was now – with a light heart. Not really willing to hear me. And that hurt me bad, at the time.

So, I waited for her to fall asleep. I sat in bed and watched her, watched how at peace she seemed to be. Seething with an un-real lie.

Then I walked out of the apartment, got in the car, and drove. I drove for a whole night and most of the next day. Not really knowing where I was going.

Jess called me once and then several times in a row. I ignored all of them. It was petty, it was childish. But I was not myself.

I came to my senses at a rest-stop, somewhere a couple of states over. Watching the sun come up over a copse of trees down the hill from the trucker-lot. Something about the time away from the two of them, about how much worse it made me feel, got me to call Jess back.

We talked for a while on the phone there, until the sun was almost setting again behind me and the woods ahead were alive with shadows. We talked a lot more on the drive home. And a whole hell of a lot more once I got there. We had a couple of hard, hard nights. But then, slowly yet wonderfully, a couple of better ones.

And then, some of the best.

“Baby,” I said, coming up behind her, sliding my arms around her waist. Hugging her from behind. “Nothing’s wrong, I promise.”

She turned around to me then, and I reached a hand up to wipe a tear off her cheek. Careful not to smudge her makeup.

“Promise?” she asked, her voice small and close to cracking.

“Swear,” I said. Kissing her.

A few moments later I was watching her go, waving from the front door. She waved back, a little smile on her lips. I watched the car go down the road until the taillights were too small to see the red.

Before shutting the door. Before letting my gaze linger above me, to the ceiling. On the other side, on the second floor, was exactly where Win’s room was.

I sat there for a moment. I listened. Wishing, really wishing, that I could believe my own lie.

\*\*

I could barely work that day, and after a few hours of half-hearted email-sorting and responding to IM’s, I had accepted that the events of the night before rendered me useless. I put myself in offline-mode and sent a message to my team that I would be out the rest of the day and shut my laptop.

Win was running around like nothing happened. After she woke up, I made her pancakes and set them for her at the table. I watched her eat them, the TV in the living room blaring an old Disney musical, while I drank my coffee. Questions surging up my tongue were begging to come out.

*‘Do you remember anything weird about last night?*’

*‘Why did you fall asleep in the closet?’*

*‘Was there something in there with you?’*

What stopped me was the joy, the gleeful nonchalance Win greeted everyday with. Her abandon and her spirit, soaring up as soon as she was, buzzed from the sugary syrup. I let her out into the backyard where she ran to her soccer ball, kicking it between the trees. I watched her from the back door, drinking cup after cup of coffee.

I wished I could have her energy. Her fearlessness. I wished I could have gotten away with drinking something stronger than coffee.

Surely, I reasoned with myself, if she had seen anything – if there had actually been anything there, in the room with us, Win would have remembered. The girl could see a caterpillar on the sidewalk in the morning and talk about it all the way until bedtime, until the next day even, urging us to walk back to where she’d seen it crawling a full day before to see if it was still there.

Which meant if she had seen something, if she had seen what I’d seen, she would have said something.

Right?

Unless, I thought, she couldn’t see it. Unless what had been in her bed that night had just been for me.

I shook my head, trying to upend the thoughts souring my mind, like I could loose them out of my ears. This was a new house, a new space, and I was filling it with my fear as much as we had filled it with our wonder, with our joy and our hope. There wasn’t anything else here with us. It was just an old, creepy house and I – this man who had spent his whole life in the suburbs and the city and considered a two-bedroom apartment just over a thousand square feet a living luxury – just wasn’t used to what dwelling in a place like this meant.

Yeah. That was it.

It had to be.

I almost lost myself in watching her, in the peace that was filling in the morning, when I remembered the toy. The doll. The little girl.

I walked away from the back door, hurrying over to where I had thrown the thing the night before. Shoving the couch back, wincing as it screeched along the hardwood floor. Flicking open the flashlight on my phone to look into the dark of the corner.

I half expected it to be gone. To be a figment, a little resident of a night I was so dearly hoping had been a dream.

But it wasn’t gone. It was exactly where I had left it: facedown in the gathering dust under the couch.

I bent to pick it up. God, it was still cold. A kind of chill in its fibers that made me think it was wet. But, as I brought it out of the dark, I ran my thumb across the stiches of the thing’s dress – they were dry. Coarse, rough like a raw rope.

I looked through the kitchen to make sure Win was occupied and happy – she was, kicking the ball and weaving in and out of the old trees back there. I bounded up the stairs, taking them two at a time, almost running to her room.

I stopped in the doorway.

Her blankets were bunched up on the bed, just as they had been the night before. In the light of morning, they seemed a harmless pile. Her comforter and sheets, wound up in a conical shape. It had been so dark the night before – was it so far fetched to assume I had dreamed up the whole thing? That maybe I had heard Win talking in her sleep and given her voice to the shape in the bed instead of the girl in the nook?

I saw Milkshake’s tail, poking out from between the blanketed folds. I reached for it, pulling it free. It was still so cold, despite spending the night buried in the blanket. I had a thought then to rip it open, Milkshake and the girl both, and see what the hell was inside. What gave them such a chill.

I felt it again then – that same prickling from being watched. I turned, slowly, expecting, *hoping* to see Win in the doorway: watching me. Imagining her devastated little face as I took her new toys; because that was what I was doing, I was sure now. I was taking them and I was going to destroy them.

Burn them, maybe. Warm them up.

But Win wasn’t in the doorway. It was empty, but I heard –

The soft shriek of hinges. The click of a latch.

I whipped toward the nook.

You know that feeling when something flickers at the edge of your vision—when you’re sure it’s there, but the moment you turn your head you catch only the briefest trace? I read once that it’s your mind filling in the gaps, a leftover instinct from our lizard brains—priming you to run before you even know what you’ve seen.

The toybox was there. Blacker than the shadows around it. Waiting.

I stepped inside, frowning as I did. The air in the nook was near freezing. Not normal cold – this was deep, cellar-cold. It made the hair on my arms stand on end.

Upstairs rooms don’t feel like that. Heat rises.

I knelt, flipping open my phone and switching on the flashlight. Shadows danced as I pressed my palm along the baseboards, searching for a draft, a crack. Some rend in the wall, some reason the space could be this chilled. Nothing. My hand rose higher. The cold sharpened near my face, like an invisible seam slicing through the air.

I followed it. Fingers outstretched. They touched something solid. Hard.

The toybox.

I slid my hand along its lid until I found the seam. The cold seeped out there, steady and unnatural.

I gripped the edge. Pulled.

Nothing.

I squatted, planted my feet, and hauled upward with all my weight. The lid didn’t shudder. It might as well have been nailed shut – or part of the floor itself.

I pressed my ear close. A faint hum trembled through the wood—distant and hollow, like something shifting deep – somewhere in the house.

I staggered back, breath fogging. My flashlight trembled.

It must have been a trick of the light. That’s what I told myself. Because the shadow beneath the toybox… it wasn’t thinning as I stared. It looked deeper. Farther away.

I reached out, slowly. My hand hovered over the crack of the lid.

Of the mouth.

For a split second, I thought it wouldn’t stop. That I’d just keep reaching, shoulder-deep, swallowed whole inside the solid square of black.

Instead, my fingers hit wood.

I jerked back.

“That’s all you are,” I whispered. “Just a trick of the dark.”

I stood up, walking quickly out of Win’s room. Hurrying down the stairs. Wanting very, very much to be out in the sunlight with my girl.

Because, for a sliver of a moment? I’d thought my hand wouldn’t touch that glistening wood. I thought it would go on and on. Stretching backwards into a space I would have to crawl into, I would have to push myself through, to find the end of.

It was impossible, I thought. My sleep-weak mind playing with me. Showing me something that simply could not be.

I set Milkshake and the doll down on the counter, hiding them behind a glass container of dried pasta so Win wouldn’t see. Resolving, promising, myself that as soon as Jess was home tomorrow to distract our girl I would take the knit little fucks out back, behind the shed.

And burn them.

\*\*

I woke up with a shudder, groggy and weightless, like I’d been held underwater. The edges of a dream slipping away from me. One in which my daughter held me, in which was staring down at me.

In the dream I couldn’t breathe.

I blinked, looking around our room in the dark. Taking in several deep, shuddering breaths. As the sleep and the dream drained out of me, I found the uneven shadows from all our half-unpacked belongings scattered around our bed a comfort. That was a kind of mess, the remnants of our shuffled life, was at least ours. It made sense. I could feel Jess’s legs pressed against me, her back turned, her form under the blanket rising and falling with silent sleeping.

My eyes caught something in the gloom.

\*CLICK\*

I squinted, leaning forward in the dark.

Another *click.* Sharp. Hollow. Rhythmic.

I turned my head toward the doorway. My heart quickened.

Win stood there.

Barefoot. Motionless. Her face lost in shadow.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

The sound was coming from her.

I swallowed. “Win?”

She didn’t move.

Jess stirred slightly beside me but didn’t wake.

“Baby?” My voice was low. Careful. I sat up, feet on the floor.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

Her jaw. I saw it now, lit from the moonlight pouring from the hallway window. Her mouth opening and shutting, teeth meeting teeth, each clack sharp in the quiet.

I reached for the lamp on my nightstand.

The room exploded in light.

Win was staring right at me.

She didn’t blink. Didn’t speak. Just stood there in her pajamas, her hair wild from sleep, eyes wide and glassy in the glow, *CLICK CLICK CLICK*, her teeth snapping together – hard, sharp and insistent.

My breath caught.

“Sweetheart,” I said softly, standing, “come here.”

She didn’t move.

I stepped to her in three quick strides, crouching to her level. She tilted her head up at me, never breaking that awful rhythm. *CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

Her bottom lip trembled, but she didn’t cry. Didn’t say anything at all.

“Win,” I whispered, “does it hurt?”

Her eyes shot to me. Wide, glistening.

Then, slowly, she opened her mouth wider.

One of her bottom teeth teetered, loose and pale in the light, hanging by the root. A pale little pearl.

*CLICK.*                                                                                                                                                

There was no blood.

*CLICK.*

I reached out, my fingers shaking, and brushed it gently. It tipped sideways in her gums.

“Teef dad-gdy,” she said through her gaping mouth, her throat and tongue working to make the words with a wide-open jaw, “my teef.”

“Jesus,” I murmured. “Okay, honey. Okay.”

She just kept staring, mouth half-open, teeth clicking together, even as I scooped her up and carried her back toward her room.

Her jaw worked the whole way.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

I laid her down in her bed, her eyes fluttering half-way closed. Resting her head on her pillow. Her mouth worked, opening and closing, as I stuck my fingers inside.

“Hold on honey,” I said, feeling her close her jaw, her tongue slithering away from my thumb, “let me get it.”

There was almost no resistance as I pulled the thing out. As soon as I did, Win’s head relaxed against the pillow, her fluttering eyes twitching shut. She started breathing, heavy, as I leaned back from her bed. Looking at the boney little pebble in my hand.

Looking at my girl, already asleep in her bed.

She was three, halfway to four. I hadn’t prepared myself to even think of when she would start losing teeth but…at her age?

It seemed wrong. Kids don’t lose teeth this young, I thought. Not unless something’s pulling at them.

*Click*.

There was a different sort of sound, a different sort of hollow snap. And it from behind me.

I jumped, turning in the dark of Win’s room.

Toward the nook.

And I felt the temperature shift – a putrid gust. Just a gash of air.

I stared down at the tooth again in my palm. Maybe it was all in my mind, or maybe it was the snap of air from the nook. But I knew what I felt.

The tooth, in my palm, was cooling. Feeling more and more like a little chip of ice. Bloodless, too tiny, and dry. I squeezed my hand shut over it, watching Win’s small chest rising and falling. The breeze from the nook brushed the back of my neck, cold and sour.

And I wondered with a twist in my heart – what if she’s not losing her teeth?

What if they’re being taken?",3,1754125556.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Am I insane for being mad about this?,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend nearly two years now, long distance. We live in different countries and visit each other, and it’s always really intense when we’re together. I love him so much. But lately he’s got it in his head that I’ve got an eating disorder and it’s seriously starting to get on my nerves.

I’ve always been naturally slim, I just don’t have a big appetite. I eat, just not that much. Usually tea or coffee in the morning, maybe some fruit, and then something small in the evening like soup or whatever. I travel a lot too and my rhythm’s all over the place which makes me less hungry. I don’t like feeling heavy or bloated. That’s just how I am. But he’s become obsessed with it.

He’s always sort of hinted at it but it properly started after I fainted once while I was with him last September. It sounds dramatic but it really wasn’t. I was knackered, barely slept, probably didn’t drink enough water. I was just standing and then next thing I remember I’m on the sofa and he’s shouting like I’d been run over. Fully freaking out like “this isn’t normal” and “if you won’t listen to me I’ll make you go to therapy”. It really annoyed me. I’m not a child and I’m not going to let anyone force me into anything. I told him he was being controlling and I’m allowed to be skinny.

He apologised later and said he was just scared and didn’t know what to do. Fine. But since then he brings it up constantly. If I say I’m not hungry or just want tea he gives me that look or says “you need to eat something” like I’m five. If I say I’m tired or dizzy he goes all serious like “this is exactly what I mean” like I’m about to collapse.

I’ve told him I’m fine. I don’t starve myself. I just eat when I’m hungry and I eat light. And yeah sometimes I’ll go a few days not eating if I’m busy with uni or travelling but many people do that. I don’t need someone hovering over me all the time.

He even sent me some video the other day like “how to support your partner with disordered eating” and I nearly blocked him. It’s like he wants me to be unwell so he can fix me or something. If I send him a selfie or an outfit pic, he always makes sure to add that I’m always looking more skinny, even when I’ve barely lost weight since we met, he also does this whenever we see each other too. I’m just so tired of it.

I’d really appreciate it if anyone could give me advice to make him stop freaking out about this and not see it as a problem.",1,1754125426.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

I've thrown away 8 years of my life 151 replies

PinkImbrella · 14/06/2025 15:13

Eight years ago I moved to be with my DP in his hometown. I spent eight years feeling hugely frustrated and isolated because he lives in the middle of nowhere. I made it work by twisting myself into knots, finding loads of creative workarounds - luckily my work is entirely remote so I could head off and travel but always tethered by his unwillingness to leave this small town. He kept saying ""not now"" or ""nows not the time"". We had loads of arguments about it over the years. The relationship was otherwise loving and supportive.

Two days ago he said ""not now"" again and I said the time for not nowing is gone, its been eight years. He finally came out with it and said he wouldn't move away from his mother - that its visceral.

Clearly this is the end then. I just feel like such a fucking mug. I feel angry at him for not having told me right from the start it would come down to this. Im so angry at myself for not seeing what was staring me right in the face. I feel so stupid. Im 38 now. I never desperately wanted kids, but i would have had them i think - its just I didn't want to be trapped in a place I hated.

Why didn't I just face up to what was clearly the reality?








PinkImbrella · 06/07/2025 06:47

Hello @OlderGlaswegianLivingInDevon and @AcrossthePond55 !

I thought I would update you. I found an extremely cheap storage place (way cheaper than in the UK) that also does removals. So they will come and pick.up some of my stuff, and the other good thing is they deliver across Europe too, so once I'm in a position to have my things back, I will just be able to call them up.

Ive only kept my couch and a few things I inherited like my grans insane crockery collection 😆 Also my desk which is huge and really nice.

On Wednesday I'm going away for two nights. And then on the 19th im moving out for good.

Unbelievably, he's still not talking to me.

**I forgot to tell you what happened on the day I got back after my trip to find a place to live: his lovely cousin called me (literally the only person in his family who I ever connected with).**
It emerges he's going around saying that its nothing to do with prioritising his mother as ""I am claiming"", and everything to do with the fact that im unstable and change idea of where I want to live every 5 seconds. He also wants nobody in his friends or family to contact me (which his cousin clearly ignored) and plans on blocking me from everything once we've parted ways.
He apparently told his cousin about blanking me. His cousin said something along the lines of ""wow, I dont know how you're managing to do that, quite harsh especially as she has to organise moving country?"" and he said ""not my problem"".

The most confusing thing about all this for me is how I went from being in a warm long term relationship to being completely frozen out over night. I could understand if its because I'd cheated, or lied in some way. But it just feels really excessive??!









PinkImbrella · 12/07/2025 08:28

So I am on the road back to base for my last week there and I feel sick to my stomach.

**I realise I forgot to tell you about something important that happened. In late June I told you someone contacted me about a work opportunity (this is a separate thing from the interview I had: I work in the arts and a lot of the things I do are commissions/residencies, you get the idea).**

Anyway, so end of June I was in my new city looking for places to live when out of the blue this really high profile institution contacted me to offer me a contract. Its so crazy how the world works sometimes. Its a really prestigious body, and here's the thing: most of it will be me working on my own wherever I like, but every other month I will get to visit the institution. Which....happens to be in his country, in one of his country's most beautiful cities.

Talk about an incredible opportunity! I still cant believe it fell in my lap like that. Obviously I accepted.

So end of June I travelled back to our house as I told you, silent treatment etc. A few days later (still end of June) I said to him: ""Just to let you know, I have been offered work in Beautiful City.""
Him: silence and no eye contact
Me: Would you consider moving there?
Him: shakes his head decisively

I thought I would tell you because it kind of rams home how lame a proposition his ""We can discuss moving to Shit City Near Me"" offer was.






PinkImbrella · 14/07/2025 18:39

Really struggling this evening. Living like this is really taking its toll on me psychologically. Still silent treatment despite his message while I was away ""offering"" the Shit City as a consolation prize.
We had tickets to a gig this eve. Which I paid for, of course. Ive brought myself to it, its in a really nice setting, just feeling edgy and dead inside.
The good news is I officially hate him. Its been FIVE WEEKS since we last had an actual conversation. Don't worry, im past the point of asking ""why?"". Now im just consumed with anger at how fucking unfair this treatment has been. Anyone would have thought I'd cleared his bank account or shagged his dad.
I cant wait to get out of here.
Ive got so much work im supposed to be getting through. I just need to keep myself calm and focused on the end goal.
Hes doing fuck all around the house. Im doing all the food shopping. Ive lost all respect for him. I cant even imagine he ever had some good traits.
He was ""lovely"": well i think I'd be pretty fucking relentlessly ""lovely"" if a man were facilitating my ideal life in my ideal town near MY mother.
I used to do all the laundry. Ive started removing all his shit from the washing machine (hello? We have a laundry basket?) and just washing my own stuff 😆 Petty but satisfying.

**I forgot to mention that when I got back from my trip on Saturday there was a big stack of cardboard boxes in the hall.**

Tomorrow im starting to pack.

I am starting to think im not even going to bother inform him of anything. It was a courtesy I was going to pay him to not be cruel and to not leave on a bad note, but actually- fuck it.





PinkImbrella · 15/07/2025 17:21

He came home, all calm. He even told me he was going to fetch a signed for letter from the post office which is unusual given he hasn't spoken to me in so long.

I saw the letter, its the official redundancy letter. Hes being made redundant on the 24th.

I cant help but feel so bad for him, like his whole life is crumbling around him. Then I remember that he could actually be seeing this as the universe smiling on him. In this country, redundancy means you get paid a high percentage of your salary for two years, I believe it is (!). I have always been the higher earner and he knows I would have funded our life while we got settled somewhere new.

He could have seen this as the perfect time to be cut loose to head off with me while still having some financial security.

I can’t tell you how much I love you for your reporting style. You are an absolute legend! I can not wait for you to find your freedom. Get out safe, soon, and with style. I dream that you turn the entire experience into a smashing one woman show and put it on at the Edinburgh festival.

Haha thank you my dear! 🤩

I used to have an agent, until my book didnt sell and she dumped me 😅 I am toying with the idea of turning it all into a novel as there's quite a lot of incredibly fucked up back story/twists and turns (we originally met in 2011) - so might find a readership with anyone who likes stories of vagabonding, domestic seething and being sectioned 😆


PinkImbrella · 17/07/2025 08:21

Really really struggling today, now all my bravado has gone and I just feel so incredibly sad and on edge. I had to take a sedative as I thought I was about to faint, now im going to be slowed down today when I have so much to be getting on with.
The movers come in 4 hours and Im giving them 3 boxes which I havent packed. I have a deadline at the end of the day, its 4 hours work and I havent even started.
Im looking at this beautiful garden filled with all these amazing trees and flowers and thinking about how shit the place im going to is in comparison. Im thinking about how he has acted like such a prick this past month and how he has been so selfish throughout the relationship, but also how close we were and how at ease I felt with him. I just feel so much regret. I wish I could be the kind of woman who would just be happy with this. Don't worry im not getting cold feet but I just feel so heartbroken and lost.

I also look like shit. My face seems to ne all saggy and red, my hair is really dry and lank, ive got a huge fucking belly, probably too much wine and stress. God 😅




PinkImbrella · 19/07/2025 21:02

FFS literally as i sent this post, I got a message from his cousin thats really making me spin out. Will translate it for you in a bit but I dont know what to think

Go to post
PinkImbrella · 19/07/2025 21:11

Hos cousin sent me a long message saying ""you really fucked up - he's a great guy, you'll never meet a man like this again. I managed to find him a great job in Shit City - this is what you always wanted, and now you've just left? You've made the biggest mistake of yoir life and lost such a good person"".




PinkImbrella · 20/07/2025 08:01

Let me give you the cousins full message, I was out saying goodbye to dad last night so didnt have time to process it. Can't be bothered to translate it all myself so put it through AI for you:

You know he won't come back !!!! he'll never accept anyone else touching you kissing you etc.... You had a strong love for each other and for me you were made to be together. I can't understand you, I'm sorry! I managed to get him a job in Shit City even though he didn't need me to get a job, and now it doesn't suit you anymore! I'm sorry Pink but when you know you've found the person of your life you do everything to keep him or her no matter where you live, you have your whole life to move on but a guy like that and as you say the man of your life you don't let him go for some location/regional bullshit! I'm really sad for you. I hope you thought carefully before making your decision because you'll never find a man like that again. I'm sorry if I'm being hard on you but I sincerely think you're going to regret it but it'll be too late 😡



PinkImbrella · 20/07/2025 08:03

So how come yesterday morning when we had our last coffee, he wasn't sitting there begging me, telling me about this supposed job, trying to convince me to change my mind the way i was him? Because deep down, he didnt want to go to Shit City, thats why.

I was in France. A very particular region in France very unlike the rest of the country.



PinkImbrella · 20/07/2025 09:25

Haha, I am a northerner originally, and I am in Brighton. Can't believe you spotted that!



PinkImbrella · 28/07/2025 13:26

Thought i would give you an update on the actual relationship stuff. Im actually worried whether im a psychopath or something because I spent the first 4 or 5 days welling up at the drop of a hat, and now its been 9 days since I left and all I feel is the faintest tug of nostalgia. Basically, im doing great!
After that weird text about his redundancy admin on fr8day morning, I replied making sympathetic sounds. He then didnt reply anything all weekend. Now he just messaged saying ""yeah its shit. How are things?"" 🤷‍♀️

Go to post
PinkImbrella · 28/07/2025 13:32

Just updating you on that now really because I remember all those years I would hungrily read threads by women in similar situations as I tried to work out my own, so in case you are reading and trying to figure out your own ""impossible situation"": im sure i will have some major dips but all I can say is ive been quite surprised by the bounceback x





PinkImbrella · 28/07/2025 18:42

pikkumyy77 · 28/07/2025 17:05

You are going to hit the posting limit so if you want continuity you might want to start another thread “to Lancaster and beyond” or something as this is what I think of your ex:

Ha! Well, it might just be me updating with ""hey guys, just ate a sandwich on a bench, feeling okay"". But having said that im maybe not out of the woods yet. Its not quite case closed until he actually leaves that house and I get teddy back is it! He just texted to say he is leaving when the notice runs out, which would be October 🤯

Is the plan to start the PhD this coming academic year, or next, OP? And will you need to be ""present"" at Norwich, or can you do it all remotely? Just idly wondering if the year in Lancaster will still work ... I do hope so!

## Core Benefits

The benefits of using a tablet with an integrated or specifically designed holder extend beyond mere convenience.

**Enhanced Productivity:** Having a stable and adjustable holder allows users to position the tablet at an optimal viewing angle, reducing neck and eye strain during prolonged use. This is especially beneficial for tasks such as typing, reading documents, or participating in video conferences. The holder also frees up hands,enabling users to multitask more efficiently. For instance, a student can take notes while simultaneously viewing a lecture video on the tablet.

**Improved Entertainment Experience:** A tablet with a holder provides a more immersive and pleasant entertainment experience. Whether watching movies, playing games, or browsing social media, users can enjoy their content hands-free. The holder allows for different viewing angles and orientations, catering to various preferences and scenarios. For example, when cooking, a user can position the tablet on the kitchen counter to follow a recipe without having to hold it.

**Increased Portability:** Many tablets with holders are designed to be lightweight and compact, making them easy to carry around. the integrated holder often folds flat or detaches, minimizing the device's overall footprint. This portability makes the tablet ideal for travel,commuting,or working on the go. A professional can easily set up a mobile workstation in a coffee shop by using the tablet with a holder.

**better Ergonomics:** The holder promotes better posture by allowing users to maintain a comfortable viewing angle and distance. This reduces the risk of developing musculoskeletal problems such as neck pain, shoulder pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome. The adjustability of the holder enables users to customize the tablet's position to suit their individual needs and preferences, whether sitting at a desk, lounging on a couch, or standing.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** While some tablets with holders may have a higher initial cost, they can be more cost-effective in the long run compared to purchasing a separate tablet and holder. The integrated design ensures compatibility and eliminates the need to search for a suitable accessory. Additionally, high-quality holders are built to last, reducing the likelihood of needing to replace them frequently.

1mflvb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExEgypt/comments/1mflvb7/am_i_wrong_was_it_my_fault/,Am i wrong ... was it my fault ??,"ارجو لو وقتك مهم او عندك وقت تقرا و ياريت تساعدني افهم الي حصل لاني مش عايز احس بلغبطة .... انا بعت لصبس كتيرة بس محدش رد...

Am i wrong ... i just broke up

This is the first real romantic relationship I’ve ever experienced, and I’m not sharing it to brag — far from it. It was painful, a harsh slap to the face, but at least it happened early in my life, and that’s a good thing. Some people spend years before going through something like this.

Okay, let’s begin.

I developed feelings for a girl at my university. She worked there — she’s a bit older than me, but only by a few months. She helped me during my final year. She’s kind, beautiful, and super friendly with everyone — very extroverted. That can be both a blessing and a curse.

Now, normally I’m not the type to get involved with girls or chase after them. I always stayed away from that stuff. But sometimes, a certain girl comes into your mind and heart, and any guy who has felt this knows how emotions can destroy everything. For two weeks straight, I couldn’t think about anything but her.

Eventually, we got to know each other more. We followed each other on Instagram, chatted, and exchanged memes. I was naive — I genuinely thought she felt the same way. I later realized I was wrong. But back then, everything felt perfect.

Let me pause the story here and explain something about her. She’s very open-minded, from an upper-class background. She mostly speaks English because she went to an international school. That wasn’t an issue for me. She liked dark/racist humor memes, swore in English, and was super casual — and again, I was totally fine with all of that.

But the downside? She wouldn’t reply right away. Sometimes she’d disappear for a while, and it bothered me how she didn’t see a problem riding alone in an Uber with a guy. (Please don’t judge me too quickly — just hear me out and try to understand my feelings.)

Anyway, I finally got the courage to confess my feelings. I was tired of hiding it. If she accepted, great. If not, I was ready to move on. I told her I loved her.

She said okay — but after I graduate. She also said I’m not in the friendzone and gave some mixed signals. But overall, I was happy and hopeful.

We kept talking on WhatsApp for a few days, then went back to Instagram. One day, I noticed she changed her profile picture, so I messaged her. I thought she would respond, especially since she said she had feelings too. But she didn’t reply at all or even react. Then four days later, she posted a story — so she clearly saw my message. I got frustrated and ignored her for two full weeks.

During that time, we had just finished a project discussion for a course. I posted a story with my friends, and I hadn’t been watching her stories or reacting at all. Out of nowhere, she liked my story and messaged me the next day, sending memes. She said, “I would’ve sent you more if I knew you weren’t busy.”
(I know you’re probably thinking, “What a fool,” but stay with me.)

I ignored her messages for three days. Then I finally replied — but calmly and distant.

Here’s something odd: she posted a story, deleted it, then reposted the same thing the next day and deleted it again. Then after messaging me, she added me to her “close friends” and posted that same story again — but deleted it 10 minutes later. I didn’t understand what that meant, and when I asked, she vaguely said it was just pointing at something, but I didn’t ask again.

We got back to talking. Things felt normal again. Then came a shocking moment — her dad passed away. May he rest in peace. I offered my condolences, of course. Later, she messaged me asking to meet up for coffee, to help her forget and distract herself.

We had a great day together — cinema, coffee, talking.

We ended up going out four times. She invited me once, I invited her once, we exchanged gifts — everything seemed fine.

Then I confessed again. I told her seriously that I loved her. She said, “Okay, give me 3 days and I’ll let you know — but only if you’re not talking to other girls or seeing me as a second option.”

Three days later, she said “okay” and confirmed her feelings. But still, whenever we went out, she’d say things like, “I don’t know how I feel toward you yet — maybe I need more time with you to figure it out.”

She would get jealous, hold my hand, rest her head on my chest or shoulder, but the words she used still sounded like we were “just friends.”

The last time we went out, everything seemed normal and fine. The day after that, still okay. The following day, I sent her a meme — and boom, she blocked me.

I was shocked.

I checked her bio — she had removed it. What the hell? She always said she was honest and didn’t ghost or block people. She said she doesn’t treat people like second options.

She hadn’t blocked me on Instagram, though. I waited a day. Then the next day, I tried calling her — no answer. I kept trying, nothing. By the end of that day, I sent her 3 Instagram messages saying basically:

“If silence is your answer, then forget about the relationship.”

The next day, she called me. Said two words. Then the call cut off from her end. I tried calling back many times. Nothing. I felt like I had the right to know why. What did I do wrong? I’m not someone who likes drama.

Then she blocked all calls from me.

I messaged her from another number, saying it’s me, just wanting to understand. Then she unfollowed me on Instagram.

At that point, you can say whatever you want about me — but I felt crushed. My dignity felt dragged through the dirt.

I honestly thought she was different from the others. Thought she was mature. But turns out, she was just a kid — even more immature than the rest.

I know I lowered myself. But I had the right to ask why. I feel broken, guilty, even stupid for being in this relationship in the first place. There were so many red flags. But any guy knows how emotions can cloud your mind.

But honestly ... am is it was my fault or my bad ?? She just blocked me for soemyhing idid and maybe idont know and she tried to reach me but though am the one who cancelled on her ??




Btw she stold me about her 2 exes she said she never had official relationship with them before but she blocked one of them and the other ghosted her ....

Edit: btw i tried to talk about girls in some place then she showed jealous idk if she were acting but she was playful jealousy

1mflodr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mflodr,Vik,"The Vik I saw was a typical highway town. I know there's a lot more to Vik, but as I said earlier, my trip is more about the spaces in between.

Thursday. I packed up and left Skogar. The small shoulders on the road returned after Skogar and was steady throughout. I wanted to make good time and so skipped the 'attractions' like the old airplane wreck on the beach.

The road becomes a series of rolling hills each of which runs through a more and more spectacular river valley. Some of the best photos would have been from the bridge, but it's not really safe, so I didn't. Alas.

Similarly I didn't turn off to Dyrhólaey, which would have added 20 km to my ride, though in different circumstances I might have. 

Not that it matters. The scenery from Skogar to Vik is stunning as you approach the big hills and bigger glaciers. It was hard to keep my eyes on the road. Traffic wasn't bad, though, and the ride was worth it.

Not long after the intersection is the first of two major hills. This one wasn't so bad. The second one - with a 12 percent grade for 500 meters - had me pushing my bike. Not so bad - just take your time.

Near the top of the hill is the turnoff to Hálsanefshellir Cave, which again would have added 20 km (plus climbing the hill twice, albeit at a more gradual climb the second time).

The descent into Vik: smooth, easy, long. I used the whole lane; there wasn't that much traffic anyway and I was going too fast to risk nearing the shoulder. Pulled in to the N1 for some delicious hot dogs and coffee.

There's a huge 'Icewear' store right there that has pretty much everything you'd need (at Iceland prices). I did a quick tour. And that's all I saw of Vik.

Instead of camping, I caught the 16:20 bus to Hofn. I know I missed out on Vik's famous beach, but I was more eager to miss the torrential rain slated for the south coast all day Friday. I'll write more about the bus ride later.",8,1754124108.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False

I am finishing my PhD thesis and life is chaos. However, I still have time to look at my cup of coffee and think about potential DLC routes. Here are some:

Oosuzuki route: after a whole loop Takumi remembers the Rebellion ending (which means he does not see what happens years after). Affected by Nozomi's death and remembering that none of their memories are real, Takumi decides to not give a fuck about humanity. The Oosuzuki's do exist in this DLC and they are an important part of the Artifical Satellite elite and Exodus Plan). Seeing their plan is going to waste, they use Kurara to influence the SDU. Basically a Kurara route that can be written in many ways.

Ecchi route: consensual NSFW fun with different members of the SDU! Always above the belly-button ofc. Overall, just a response of Cult of Takumi where you can be comfy with what is going on.

X factor route: V'exhness is aware of the loop. She decides the break free from it, but she is unsure why... Until she receives a memo: the power of music is unstoppable. V'exhness casts the commander and the SDU members to sing their hearts out. Friendship, rivalry, romance... All will be dealt here. Maybe even for V'exhness. Another silly-goose route.

Romance route - extended: more romances for all SDU members! This one is focus on Takumi, though.

Cupid route: more romances! But Takumi tries to get people together.

He says he’ll try. 
He doesn’t stop.
I call out to him and ask him to quieten it down. 

I ask him at least three times before my mom screams my name and says “Shut up, he cant control it, give it a rest!” 

Obviously I know he cant control it, but you have to understand it’s the most obnoxiously loud and forced cough. It’s not really a cough it’s like a really loud clearing throat noise. it’s not that hard to hold for just ten minutes… right?

Lose the war. Return to the past. Fight. Die. Respawn. Repeat... Statistically, humankind doesn’t stand a chance.❖**

To be transported to a world of gods and magic. To become a \[hero\], wield a sword or sorcery, level up to to overcome human limits, and never have to fear death again... or almost. Who wouldn't love it? It would sound like a dream too good to be true!

Well, that's what many believed.

Despite every effort, it took barely a few decades for the billions of humanity—used as semi-immortal cannon fodder in a war against what does not die—to face near-total extinction. In a desperate act, the last survivors struggled to cross the floors of a labyrinth housing a temporal artifact. They wanted to send a hero into the past. Final report: forces exterminated. Mission: active. Status: sole survivor.

...I was there.

How far can humanity be pushed? And how many will remain to celebrate “victory”? There's only one way to find out. I’m sure everything will be alright.

**Chapter 1: End.**

*« Don’t die uselessly. An enemy sorcerer is casting a calcination or explosive-type spell, and it’s already too late to interrupt or find cover? Don’t just stand there like an idiot. Charge. Grab him. Take him with you in the blast. Your comrades will return the favor when the time comes. Sometimes. Lasting friendships are born and built on small gestures. »*

— *Tips from the* ***(Unofficial) Strategic Guide for Summoned Heroes***\*,\* *Vol. I, 4th Edition*

When I was a child, I loved the stories my grandfather told me. When he wasn’t speaking of cosmic monsters and stars that flared and died, exploding like enraged gods across the sky, he would tell me of adventurers braving the darkness, of heroes and their companions defying evil, of trials where determination always triumphed. Good prevailed, evil was punished, and the final page always closed on a saved world.

As I grew older, the tone changed. The hero no longer merely defeated the forces of evil. He also encountered beauties in distress—often buxom elf maidens—and invariably ended up celebrated as a living legend. The dangers were just sharp enough to add a thrill, victories were narrow but resounding, and of course, a harem inevitably assembled itself, each girl falling under his charm.

Looking back now, I can say it plainly.

*Despicable propaganda.*

I cast a glance at my proud companions. They were here. Portable ends of the world vaguely disguised as civilized beings. Walls didn’t stop them. Armies didn’t slow them down. Only geography could still pretend to pose an obstacle—and even then.

Scho, the old man, a first-generation summon, the most powerful among us, crushed monsters as if he were testing the world’s solidity. His eyebrows were permanently furrowed, as if he had been born annoyed.

Khulan, the Dragoness, delicate as a warrior queen. The fire of the world answered her anger, and her hands carved burning furrows through armies. She bore that fixed gaze of those who know the universe owes them something… and that it will pay.

Jian Wei, the Puppeteer. He knew how to get the most out of a life. Always. His only enemies were those he had yet to meet. Armies collapsed from afar, sliced by strings they would never see. Beneath his silver brows, his eyes sparkled with an icy fire.

Akemi, the Iron Mother, closer to stone than to romance—or even her own youth. Her whispers were sentences: cold was born, death fell. Her stern face never changed.

Kal, the Catastrophic. He wasn’t a warrior, but a calamity on the move. He turned every battle into an apocalypse. You’d think the Gods themselves had sent him—if they had ever been stupid enough to create such a thing.

And finally… Elunea.

Among monsters, Elunea was a category of her own.

The savior. Last hope of the Empire.

Her hand clenched on the black wood of her staff, her eyes shut but still haughty, as if waiting for an apology for simply existing beneath her gaze. Her expression betrayed less pain than ecstasy—the kind she always kept whenever a spell annihilated something irreplaceable.

Like a breath of light in soot, the sublime pale Elf with blood-red hair often came seeking moments of intimacy with me, always approaching with that ambiguous smile, somewhere between tenderness and hunger. She liked to linger on each second to savor the moment, before her red lips, soft as silk, pressed against my neck and slowly parted… only to sink her sharp fangs into my jugular.

I was, according to her, her most delicious way to restore her mana. Often, when she leaned back, a satisfied gleam in her eye, she would absentmindedly run her tongue along her lips, savoring the last drops. *“Mmh… you really are still my favorite meal,”* she would always whisper with a hint of satisfaction, as if she had just popped a candy into her mouth on a lazy afternoon, just because.

The magnificent heroine liked to cast spells more often than necessary, and she always found an excellent reason to send me scouting ahead—to secure dangerous areas, check that no monster was too lethal, and of course, to personally verify the presence or absence of traps. With my body. Claiming that with my high resistances and because my body could supposedly regenerate in a few moments as long as the right bits of brain or enough spinal cord remained, it made perfect sense for me to always be the first to assess the severity of the danger.

A purely pragmatic and perfectly reasonable choice but… I knew better. The *shameful* truth behind this odious discrimination. She never hesitated to linger a bit at the scene after my misadventures, a satisfied smile on her lips, picking up what remained of me from the floor with her fingertips for an impromptu snack. *“Might as well not waste it…”* she would say, delicately licking her fingers, mouth half-full, with a feigned innocent look.

My eyes slid to the ring she had given me, just after the fall of Ylhordeth, Guardian of the Eclipse Gate, on the penultimate floor. I removed it, then slowly slipped it onto Elunéa’s pale, slender fingers. The system-guide responded to my gaze, displaying its holographic message.

***\[Spirit-Stone Ring\]***

*\[A silver ring set with a Spirit-Stone gem burns with a gentle warmth while emitting a soothing glow. Forged and blessed by a servant of Pyraethiel to ward off the insidious pull of the Abyss. When the wearer slips it on and the bond is established, they can feel the Spirit-Stone burning in their heart and sense the beat of their soul resonating in unison. Partially protects its wearer from madness, nightmares, and the insatiable hunger of soul- and light-starved existences. The symbol of the Goddess has been delicately engraved on its surface.\]*

With a thought, I dismissed the untimely message, and my attention returned to Elunéa. Her skin was warm beneath my fingers. Like an ember under ash. She looked like the princess of a fairy tale, ready to wake at the kiss of a charming hero. Unfortunately, even the grace of a kiss—even a sincere and passionate one—or the hot blood she so adored, would not be enough to pull her from her sleep without return.

What a shame.

Despite my efforts to protect her, even her power, the support of the best artifacts, her multilayered protective force fields, and a stack of ninth-rank magical barriers—worthy of any fortress wall—had not been enough to keep her alive.

Like all the others, for that matter.

The bodies of my comrades-in-arms—eighteen out of the one hundred fifty-nine of us who had once passed through this floor’s gates. Last witnesses of our home world or of our struggles, their silhouettes, scattered in the silent immensity of the last floor of the Labyrinth, lay like frozen fragments of a dead world. The calm of their rest had nothing peaceful about it. It was a void. A waiting.

And in the middle of the room, the Thread of Existence of Greralei still shone. Faintly.

Hope survived in there.

In that… and in the ever more frequent visits of the Devourers.

A shiver ran through me. Not from cold, but from a familiar vibration in the air, a tension in the fabric of reality. The floor trembled slightly, the glyphs briefly went dark, and I rose, eyes turned toward the immense door at the back of the hall.

Hostile incoming.

The Tide of Madness spilled into the hall like a flow of black ink streaked with stars. A wave rippled through space. Slow. Silent. Distorting. Light faded around it. Its substance, hesitating between liquid, gas, and gelatin, undulated like a nightmare in suspension. Beneath its viscous surface, an ocean of warped faces, frozen in fear or pleading, appeared in waves—eyes wide, mouths open in voiceless screams. They slid, melted, returned, trapped in the mass like dead thoughts looping forever. Inverted reflections flared and vanished around it—as if the room remembered itself poorly. It advanced. Incongruous. Incoherent. And wherever it passed, the glyphs died.

Too close. Unacceptable.

I gripped the hilt. Poured **\[Tyrant of Reflections\]** into space itself, folding the distance between us. My blade cut through the air. A black slash split the creature into five amorphous masses. Its gelatinous substance tore apart, dissolving into the void. Faces burst across its surface, twisted in agony, screaming with dissonant voices. Behind the shreds, five translucent hearts, pulsing with a sickly glow. I whispered a mental command through \[Negation\], and their existence was erased. As if they had never been there. The screams died with them. In the residual fragments, a few expressions softened. The look of mute relief. Silence. Clean. Absolute. As if it had finally let them go.

***You have slain a \[Tide of Madness\].***

***You receive 98,200 soul echoes.***

Wisps of bluish mist rose from the carcass, curling around me before being absorbed into my chest, accompanied by a sticky, abnormal feeling. The intruder slowly dissipated into swirls of darkness, its stars extinguishing one by one. But the walls still vibrated, the dim glyphs barely flickered. Then, slowly, the light returned. As if nothing had happened.

But below, I could feel the Devourers climbing. Crawling. Relentless. Vomited from the rifts of the lower levels for two centuries straight. They twisted the corridors, devoured glyphs, saturated the air, pushing forward endlessly despite the hell of obstacles they faced. I didn’t need to see them. The smell was enough—the stench of foul, distorted souls, of shattered existences sustained in the Abyss. The time between intrusions was shrinking before my eyes. The third in two hours. Three minutes sooner than the previous one, and three less than the one before that. Greilalei’s powers could no longer hold this place much longer; the end was here. But for what remained to be done, it would suffice.

A hollow beat pulsed in my temples. A dissonance in the air, brief, intrusive. Something was still floating. A residue of unreality, suspended like an error in the fabric of the world. The smell followed. Incoherent. A mix of cold entrails and a scent that should never have existed.

The bodies lay still. Elunéa. My companions. Motionless in death. But the air brushed them. Their features had frozen—differently. Not like before. Something had tugged at their nerves. Tightened their jaws. Then what I saw, I would have preferred not to interpret. A twitch. First imperceptible. A finger that spasmed. A leg that tensed. Barely a hint of movement, light, almost unreal, but there. As if even in death, they were still trying to escape something.

""I am here. They won’t take you."" I murmured, reaching out my hand toward them.

I let my mana boil. Raw energy pulsed in my veins, flooding the space around me in burning waves. The air vibrated under the pressure, erasing the last remnants of that absurd sensation, chasing away even the faintest trace of that unspeakable taint. The anomaly vanished. Their bodies stopped twitching, surrendering once more to stillness, even if no living being remained to guard them.

Then I straightened.

It was time.

I approached the center, my fingers brushing the Thread of Existence, which seemed to have waited far too long for this moment.

Sacred mana passed through my mind, and slowly the Hall began its metamorphosis from its edges, its walls widening with an almost organic fluidity, stretching endlessly, as if space itself expanded to welcome what was to come. The golden glyph circles vibrated, redefining themselves, reordering around the center, and with them, memories resonated, feeding the thread of existence. Forgotten faces, muffled voices, broken promises—they rose, in a silent, steady flow, first in light touches, then swelling like a river before the flood.

Death, I discovered one day, was nothing like what I had expected.

Not that I had believed in anything particular, but I had still hoped that after my last breath, my soul would find an exciting, entertaining place. And if not, at least peaceful and comfortable. Ideally, after a full life and a few points of pride to my name: memorable deeds, a loving and devoted wife, fulfilled children, a place to call home.

Maybe even that a kind, beautiful Goddess would welcome me, enveloping me in a comforting embrace, her smile radiating infinite benevolence, whispering softly, *“You have shown courage, my child. Your life was worth living.”*

So, when I died for the first time, I was relieved to find there was indeed something after.

It happened almost four centuries ago, so my memories may not be perfect: it was a perfect evening to do nothing. I was comfortably slumped in my armchair, in a position that would undoubtedly make any under-evolved life form jealous, busy playing with my guild on my favorite MMORPG, *King’s Field Online: Last Hope*, finally ready to reach the legendary level 100, while thinking about how to pay last month’s rent after another failed job interview.

And then… it happened.

First, distant church bells. I first thought it was a virus or some ad playing in the background on my browser despite my adblocker, but it wasn’t that. I took off my headset, but the sound only grew louder. One instant, a searing pain shot through my body, and a crash of bells exploded in my ears. The next moment, I was elsewhere. Beneath a black sky that devoured all light, icy air carrying hints of rot. Around me, hundreds of panicked faces.

And as I was wondering what the hell this mess was, she appeared, shrouded in light and power. The Empress of the Adencian Empire. With an impassive voice, she explained that, by the will of the Goddess of Earth, all of Humanity would be summoned—or rather, thrown—into the dying world of Yvelmore. Something about a divine punishment for ravaging our world, and at the same time, a chance for redemption in another, to compensate for the crime of our race.

She had said something like, *“Kill stuff to get stronger, and get stronger to kill more stuff.”* before adding *“please.”*

Maybe.

…

No. It was probably a bit more solemn than that.

Either way, that “redemption” had been a radical turning point for my personal plans. When I realized the situation, my veteran RPG player instincts immediately kicked in. The dream was finally real! No more job hunting, no more worrying about rent!

Mortal, lowly concerns were no longer worthy to enter my eyes. My heart swelled with hope and visions of a life of thrilling adventures and boundless fantasies waiting to be seized with my own hands. The truth was obvious. I was ready. This world was just waiting for me to be saved. It was nothing but destiny calling.

So when the first enemies appeared, I charged with the sword techniques I had perfected in my VR games.

Glory and power were calling me!

But barely a few moments and a handful of screams later—along with a thoroughly ruined pair of pants… I was dead.

Game over. Just like that, shredded between the bloody jaws of a horrible undead beast. Happy life? Love? Glory and power? My adventure ended as abruptly as it had begun. Yet, to my great surprise, that wasn’t the end. When I regained consciousness, opening my eyes and breathing deep… well… I wasn’t dead anymore.

Would it be fair to say life was full of surprises?

The beginning was rough, but I didn’t let it bring me down. After all, wasn’t that how heroes were born? Just a small setback. After a long stay in the hellish training camp, as summoned Heroes, our mission was to be sent through portals into Fallen Kingdoms filled to the brim with dead things—but not quite dead—in the hope of recovering the lost souls of the Gods, as well as serving as “Protectors” by participating in the defense of the Empire’s borders and cities.

So I gave it my all.

Glory and power awaited!

However, during my first expedition into the Fallen Kingdoms, I quickly realized—perhaps too quickly—that my new home and new lifestyle weren’t as promising as I had initially imagined. There was, of course, a certain perverse satisfaction in growing stronger, but… seeing men and women, sometimes even mere teenagers, torn to pieces, dismembered alive, and devoured by horrific monsters, their muffled screams choked only by the blood gushing from their mouths… was, alas, not quite the sweet, thrilling heroic saga I had hoped for. I told myself it was just another setback. So I didn’t give up.

Glory and power still awaited!

They just demanded I dig a little deeper to reach them.

Unfortunately, “Protector” was probably a bit too eloquent a word to describe our role in defending the Empire’s borders and cities. Meatbags tossed into the front lines against the swarming masses of enemies, before being resurrected to join the next wave of expeditions, over and over, until the enemy was gone—or until no one was left to continue—would probably be a more accurate description. We weren’t immortal, though. The very convenient resurrection came at a cost: the soul. And it always broke in the end. There was nothing else to do. I kept going.

It was just a matter of pushing a little harder. So I pushed. Hard.

Bad luck for us, what was considered deliverance for many wasn’t exactly a good thing for us. Because almost all summoned Heroes disappeared before reaching a level of power sufficient to set foot in the final Kingdom. No matter how high, how powerful, or how skilled the strongest among us became, we were too few to complete our task and escape the cycle. Glory and power were ultimately nothing but vain shadows.

I discovered the painful truth.

The kind, beautiful, gentle Goddess full of promises, supposedly waiting to welcome us warmly after death, was in fact the vengeful type. And she was probably furious. Holding an infinite grudge, this world was nothing but a prison where she had condemned us to rot.

Less than nine standard years after my summoning, despite our highly reusable lives and the Empire’s colossal armies, faced with enemies too numerous to count—enemies that could resurrect infinitely—and a final Kingdom impossible to overcome, the inevitable finally happened.

We lost. Miserably.

This war had been beyond us from the very beginning.

We were simply on the wrong side of the cosmic abacus.

During the fall of the capital, the Empire’s last bastion, the Empress led us—the last survivors—up to the gates of Greilalei’s Labyrinth, then turned away, without a backward glance. She remained outside, facing the horrors that gutted the world, and the doors sealed behind us.

And so we, the last alliance between surviving summoned heroes and the Empire’s scraps, fought relentlessly to reach the final floor. But each tier of the Labyrinth was a blood-soaked battlefield, and every floor saw our brothers and sisters-in-arms fall, one by one. After nine long years wandering its halls, our group—once counted in tens of thousands on the first floor—was reduced to barely a hundred by the time we cleared the penultimate floor.

When at last we crossed the threshold of the final floor, even those who should never have survived were beyond level 700.

They were no longer mere mortals; they were war itself made flesh.

Yet the Guardian of the final floor, a horror from a forgotten era, was unimpressed. In barely a few minutes, it swept away most of our squad. Its claws, as sharp as the purest crystal, and its magic of disintegration and negation, spread death and annihilation in an instant. One hundred fifty-eight lives, reduced to wind, blown away by overwhelming difference. It hadn’t fought. It had simply existed, shredded, erased—and that had been enough.

I saw the last of them, Elunea, collapse before the nightmare incarnate, her final spells fading like shooting stars in the night.

When the inevitable became clear, she didn’t hesitate. After one last of those smiles only she could give, she cast a final suicidal spell, consuming her own essence to break the defenses of the titanic horror. Her scream still echoes in my head sometimes. No bravado, no defiance. Just the pure pain of a soul crushed by her own magic. But she didn’t retreat. She clung to her final spell, shaping it in her agony. Then she went out, and I was left alone with what had to die.

When it was all over, I raised my weapon in a victory cry greeted by silence.

Despite everyone’s death, our sacrifices had finally brought us to our goal. Greilalei’s Thread of Existence. A simple thread of light, seemingly fragile, woven into the very existence of the Goddess of Time and Space, would bring me back to change the course of the war.

But touching it and making a wish wasn’t enough. It was far more complex than it seemed. An instruction manual? Yes, thankfully, there was one. It wasn’t hard to find—in fact, it was impossible to miss, because it was right there, before my eyes. All around me.

Literally.

The thousands of fine golden, luminous lines that had once seemed like pretty decorations, covering the floor, walls, and ceiling of blue stone, interweaving in this immense hall, hundreds of meters high and stretching for kilometers… that was the manual. When I realized what it was, I felt like a student facing an exam he had never studied for.

I think I even fainted.

…

Just a few minutes.

Probably combat fatigue!

Fortunately, I wasn’t totally ignorant in sorcery. In Nocteterre as in the Six Kingdoms, ignorance killed more surely than any spell. You had to understand it, even without mastering it, to hope to survive. Elunea, in particular, had ensured I never had that luxury.

She had always had this marked taste for displaying knowledge, an almost compulsive need to explain. In her eyes, not understanding was equivalent to offending the order of the world—and if she had had the choice, she probably would have vaporized the ignorant to save time. So she forged me through icy contempt, biting remarks, and bursts of spellcraft, until my answers no longer irritated her, and always came back to teach me more. With a consistency that was almost… faithful.

The moment to use all that knowledge savagely hammered into me had finally come! I felt up to it, so of course I didn’t back down from this new challenge. After everything I had endured, how could it have been difficult?

The answer: harder than I thought.

Even with the skill **\[Multiple Consciousness\]** —the treasure I thank the heavens for each day— and by adding twelve parallel versions of myself to work on the question, every line of the formula in this immense room wasn’t just complex and hellishly long: every intersection interacted with every segment it crossed, opening multiple possible interpretations and a different meaning for each of those it was connected to.

My knowledge wasn’t enough. So, armed with the various trinkets and the countless collections of dusty, massive books brought by the sorcerers of the group, I launched myself into the complex and delicate quest for knowledge. Patiently deciphering damn forgotten glyphs and decoding the meaning of cryptic texts on magical theory, which had probably only been designed to push the patience of the most enduring man to its limits.

Honestly, the stagnant water of the years that passed had slowly eroded my memory. But every time I was about to give up, the presence of Elunéa and the memory of my fallen comrades pushed me to continue. The hope of seeing the faces that had been dear to me again was an incomparable support.

If my first Masters and instructors had been able to see me at that moment, they would certainly have given me a solid slap on the shoulder before rewarding me with an encouraging speech. I could perfectly imagine the face of an instructor who would have said something like: *“Isn’t this exactly what I said? Violence doesn’t solve everything, kid. But it sure helps. Once beaten enough, even a weakling can end up a useful warrior, as fierce and tenacious as an angry wife! Partly thanks to your pitiful efforts, but mostly thanks to our many encouragements, you’ve finally become worthy of being called a man. Bravo!”*

That’s it. I persevered and continued for one single reason: duty.

Well, I won’t lie, the “saving Humanity” part held an important place, that’s true. My initial determination obviously had almost nothing to do with the fact that I was locked in this immense place, completely alone, with the only leisure of reading the most boring books ever created or endlessly killing monstrosities.

Yes.

Only halfway.

I cast a quick glance at the enormous pile of books, stacked in organized chaos, rising before me like an unstable building.

***\[Grimoire of Kal Tazor\]***

*\[This massive book, bound in worn leather, in thirteen parts, might be the key to mastering immeasurable magical knowledge. Its yellowed, fragile pages describe ancient spells with excessive precision and content so dry that even the most dedicated researchers abandoned it before understanding anything. It is said that a master, exasperated by his heir disciple, imposed this tome as punishment—and since then, the ordeal has become a tradition, passed down from generation to generation.\]*

My eyes trembled, and my body grew feverish as my gaze, involuntarily, landed on the last book sticking out from the immense pile of thousands of others.

…I suffered.

God, I suffered.

From there, I gradually understood that it was much more intuitive to use than I had thought. Nothing complicated. In reality, it simply required rearranging a few glyphs to produce the desired effect. Pleasantly simple. The only difficulty was knowing which ones. Not so long, it only took me two centuries. There was just one small problem. The ritual brought back the mind, yes. Memory too. And even, in an almost poetic surge, the deepest—essential—part of the soul, sure. But the powers? The formula didn’t care in the slightest.

How could I accept losing what I had fought so hard for?

I fully understood it with time, as I drew, refined, and redrew the plans of my return. Power was the key. So I transformed. Corrected. Destroyed. Restarted. Improved. I tested, isolated, dissected every variable. Sometimes it was the steps I disintegrated. Sometimes, it was me. But after so many modifications, I had found a viable ritual configuration. Unstable, but functional. It should allow me to return with a part of what I was. Between a third… and maybe all of it.

I hoped.

Of course, no plan could be flawless. After modification, the probability that a mistake would end as a second Big Bang exceeded 98%, but the margin of error was now, and I was rather proud of it, only 23.9%! Just one probability among many. Small. Low. Which meant 76.1% chance that I would become a hero.

Easy.

If the ritual worked, good. If not? Well… too bad. I had always loved astronomy and explosions; it would just be a way to combine two of my favorite hobbies. If humanity failed despite a hand this generous, maybe continuing would amount to cruelty. Sure, I could have chosen the safe path, but existence had taught us early: sometimes, there is no good solution. Just a pile of bad ones.

The world demanded a savior.

I merely answered humbly to that call.

I left a final kiss and gave a last farewell to my comrades and walked to the center. The Thread of Existence of Greralei pulsed before me, aware of my intentions. I spoke in the sacred language of the Lords. Each word triggered a vibration in the air, a subtle response from the mana accumulated around me. The glyphs began to activate, one by one, their golden lights dancing like stars in the night. An ancient presence entered the Hall.

I pushed **\[Multiple Consciousness\]** to the maximum. Twenty-four versions of myself acted in unison. We checked the flows crossing the matrix line by line, layer by layer, and systematically carried out a triple verification to ensure that the priority order of the glyphs triggering the command sequences had no conflict at each successive level. Results: compliant. Complete analysis of 1,024 sequences. No conflicts. Instabilities: thresholds below one tenth. Divergences: negligible. The breath of the Goddess’s soul, dormant for eons, awaited my touch, my breath of life.

Then I launched the final command.

I breathed a new will into it, reigniting my memory, reshaping my exact recollection of the moment I needed to return to. The glyphs unified. An ancient vibration resonated in the Hall. The last piece of the magical puzzle clicked in my mind. Something changed. A wave of power engulfed me. Then, for the first and last time in millennia, the divine, sacred presence of Greilalei’s powers, once Goddess of existence, time, and dimensional laws, honored and descended once more into the mortal, material world. It passed through me. Tore me apart. Dissolved my form. I was hurled out of myself, drowned in a maelstrom of raw mana.

And the universe itself trembled.

My existence stretched. I was everywhere and nowhere, witness to eternity and the instant. There was cold—glacial, absolute, birthing worlds—and the burning heat of an explosive, primordial fire, screaming creator, as if I were plunged into the crucible of life itself.

There is a space between worlds.

I don’t mean the empty space between the stars, nor those black gulfs between galaxies you would gaze at in the night sky. No. What I mean escapes the laws of matter and time, before the births of multiverses. It is something more abstract and indefinable, in the very foundations of reality where the world has not yet chosen what it will become. A different plane of existence, where infinite possibilities and potentials reside, each waiting with infinite patience for the moment and opportunity to bloom and manifest through the endless, beginningless continuum of eternity. Where magic is born and lives, just above where the thoughts and emotions of sentient beings mingle, where their dreams and nightmares, hopes and fears resonate.

That is what welcomed me and fully wrapped me.

(RR link: [Soulswar: Apocalypse](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/127110/soulswar-apocalypse-death-respawn-system-mass-scale))

Memories returned like a wave. Shards of myself, confused, tangled. Deaths. Oaths. Wars. Nothing held together anymore. And yet, it all composed me. Each fragment reminded me of a version of what I had been. Then, slowly, the edges of that indistinct flow tightened.

The world wanted me back. Everything slowed. From the abstract, I fell back into the concrete. My being grew heavier. Something pulled me downward, compressed me. I folded back into a shape. Too narrow. Too rigid. As if the universe were trying to force me into a mold it had already forgotten.

Then, the impact—a brutal collision with reality.

Matter returned all at once. My blood roared in my temples. My nerves exploded, each fiber of flesh relearning to obey a world whose laws had become rigid again.

Reality caught on my retina. Pale lights. A white room. A conference table, a blank screen, documents pinned to walls. And three humans. Nothing had changed. A bald man in a suit, pen hovering over a notebook. A woman in a business outfit crossing her legs like a judgment. To my right, an assistant with a tight bun, holding a trembling tray.

Sound arrived last. A fuzzy hum, then:

“...Givrenoir... would... like...?” A voice. Soft. Ordinary. Too human. In a forgotten yet banal and familiar language.

The world moved with an elastic slowness. Sound was just a blurred echo, an indistinct vibration with frayed edges. I heard my name without recognizing it—ordinary syllables, drowned in a background hum. Lips moved, but the voice reached me only in fragments.

I remained silent, unable to comprehend or move. My gaze slowly drifted toward the female figure. Her gestures held the unreal texture of a fading dream upon waking.

The tray slipped from her hands. White shards struck the floor with a muffled crash. Liquid spread, but I did not follow its path. My body stayed frozen. I had not yet fully returned. She stepped back, face drained of color, wiped the floor in haste, then slowly vanished behind the door. The man and woman stared at me, stunned—one still holding his pen aloft, the other slowly closing her folder.

The air smelled of plastic, coffee, and dry heating. A setting straight out of Earth’s dullest imagination—beige walls and bureaucracy... The whole setting felt unreal, like a cheap replica of life. It feels... so wrong.

Unmistakable.

My heart pounded. Once. Twice. A violent spasm pulsed through the mana. My throat tightened.

Ah, good old Earth... still as gray and welcoming as ever.

The wait was long.

Let the second round begin, *Humanity*

My anxiety and despair have gotten so terrible lately that I'm trying vitamins once more. According to the quiz I took after reading Mood Cure, I am lacking in all four categories, which, if my memory serves me well, means I am lacking in serotonin, catecholamines, GABA, and endorphins. 

I've spent a week following this supplement regimen: 

225 mg of l-theanine first thing in the morning along with german coffee, ksm 66 and moda from sportsresearch, ndepot and highstreetpharma and dinner: only 50 mg l theanine

Five hours before to bedtime: (NOW True Calm) 200 mg GABA, 200 mg glycine, 200 mg taurine, 100 mg inositol, 45 mg vitamin B3, 25 mg valerian, 6.5 mg magnesium, and 8 mg B6 from now foods and zen research.

So far it's helping with the dark/obsessive thoughts that were keeping me awake at night, but during the day I feel drowsy, heavy, and unmotivated. I suspect I need dopamine?

i did try to correct this habbit but i would keep forgetting 😭 i mostly drink flavored juices and coffee. i dont sweat that much even after a 5k walk so im kinda worried. and the number of times i urinate has decreased as well.
