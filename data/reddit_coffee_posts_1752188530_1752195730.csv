1lwtgaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lwtgaa/my_best_friend_of_22_years_voted_for_trump_and/,My best friend of 22 years voted for trump and didn't tell me until randomly on a Tuesday night,"On Tuesday I was venting to one of my bestfriends about a visit with my mom on the Saturday before.
For context I'll explain that conversation. 
I was very anxious but had to see my mom in person for coffee to tell her I might do just one wedding and thats a destination wedding instead of the initial plan of one nearby to most of our families where we currently live, and one in my fiances home country. A few months back my mom told me she doesn't love to travel and wouldn't if she didn't have to. She felt her and I weren't close and she wasn't the mother of a bride. We've reconnected more the past 6 months and I have made huge efforts to include her in all wedding ideas and planning. She said she would be there for my wedding regardless of where it is. This eased my anxiety, but then she immediately went onto rant about that she (white woman aprox 50 y/o) is worried she would be a target when traveling and that others hate americans right now, etc, etc. I had to ask her nicely if we could change subjects twice before she stopped her passionate rambling on how trumps ideas for deportations, building a wall are great, that he is getting criminals out of our country, and people should go back to their country and get a US citizenship then come back, and many more racist and inconsiderate comments. 

93% of people detained by ICE have no violent criminal conviction btw. Look it up. 
I was disgusted to say the least. 
I am marrying a Hispanic man, we are having our wedding in South America where he's from... 
I then go on to rant about this to my friend via videos on snapchat on Tuesday. I read most of her response Tuesday, then the rest on Wednesday morning. Her message says ""I might have voted for him, but I don't agree with everything"" I was hoping I read it wrong, I asked to clarify it today she told me she was afraid the world would become a UN if she had voted for Kamala. She was just in a polyamorous (3 person) relationship of 3 years with a girl, also a biracial relationship, and is now pregnant with a girl and applying for wick and other health care help. She has been so upset and worried about her money and healthcare and now I don't feel bad anymore for her struggle that she voted for. 
 I am so shocked that she kept this from me and just randomly now tells me this after shes heard my complaints and panic attacks these past 9 months. Some of her comments have been off, and now this makes more sense of it. She is also a bridesmaid in my wedding. I am so confused on how to feel, should I feel betrayed for this being unmentioned when we would ramble about everything all the time and I thought I knew everything. I thought I knew her well. I have no idea who she is now, and I am so disappointed. 
I am distancing myself from people who have different political beliefs because lots of trump supporters are hostile and don't let me get a word in and have to shove it down my throat how good he is. If they have to convince me, they should know it's not a good situation that hes put us in. She's been my friend for 22 years. I'm thinking I should distance myself unless, she, on her own says she regrets this entirely and it was the biggest mistake shes ever made, but it seems she still is fine with some things he's done. I still will never be able to look at her the same. She is supposedly spiritual and holistic and it all seems false now. She seems like a lost confused person. 

So this week I learned my mom and bestfriend are trump supporters while I am marrying a Hispanic man. And that wasnt even half of the bad events. 

I am so ashamed to have them at my wedding pretending to support biracial marriages and Hispanic people when they voted against this. 

Thank you for reading this long story. I am NOT looking for any discussion on politics, I won't respond and will delete. 
Please only comment if you have advice on what to do about friendship issues similar or if you have been in similar situations. Also I'm not someone to make excuses because it's a long term relationship/friendship/or family. Love should be conditional and people should care about others rights and equality when voting. 

I will update if we talk more or theres anything worth updating.",0,1752195241.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

I’m so sad though I literally am hiding in dresses, can’t wear any type of pant comfortably, and feel like anytime I mention it to anyone they think I’m so petite that I don’t have anything to complain about. Anyone else with diastasis this far out? Consulting GI just in case but I don’t feel pushed out, eat mostly paleo, no sugar, cut out coffee two mo ago, only drink 1-2 drinks a wk.

It has to wait until The Weekend because I have two jobs m-f, which sucks but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to set it so far out since our conversations were all flowing so naturally. She said “omggggggg yesssssss!” And was super enthusiastic, but since then she’s been super hot and cold. Sometimes I’m getting one word responses or just emojis after 4-6 hours, and sometimes the conversation is flowing super fast and smooth. 

That in and of itself is totally fine, people get busy, people have lives. But yesterday we were talking about music and I asked if she liked this one band that was similar to one she already liked and now I’ve been on delivered for 24 hours. 

This one is new for me. Usually I wouldn’t worry about it, I’d just move on, but since we already have a date planned it feels super awkward. 

If I double text that feels weird but it feels weird to have that just hanging there. 

Trust me, I understand the busy life thing, but I work 60 hour weeks and keep multiple hobbies alive and well and I’ve never had a 24 hour period where I couldn’t respond to a text. 

I feel like just telling her this isn’t for us, hit me up if you’re in the area again. Advice?",1,1752195166.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1lwtcw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Write_Right/comments/1lwtcw1/the_silence_index_part_5/,The Silence Index - part 5,"My name is Lieutenant Samuel Rooke. A desk jockey for D-SAT. After my escape from the Level 4, they’ve assigned me to update the index with new information.

Our world has been falling silent at a faster rate than before. The zones aren’t following our current categorization anymore — the Silence Index. It is my job to compile reports, update records, and inform fellow members of the Department of Silent Anomaly Tracking of our new findings. I hate it.

I start my mornings alone, in my apartment. I’m not on-call anymore, and I’m not really forced into a strict schedule. There’s still an office, but I take most of my work home. I don’t like being there. There’s too many people — and these days I’m not sure who to trust.

Today I had breakfast planned with my sister. She works at the food sorting facility — pulling out what’s still edible, tossing what’s not. It was a good job for her. She didn’t need to talk to people, could work by herself. And it kept her mind occupied. Most days she just sits there, replaying the events of our childhood over and over in her head.

I sorted the paperwork I had left out on my desk overnight. I don’t know how they expected me to update our index when half the reports were redacted. Didn’t matter. I would learn what they were keeping quiet about one way or another. Tonight, I was going into one of their research zones.

No, they hadn’t granted me access yet. But I needed to know more. I wanted to. I had seen the zones expand. I had seen the creatures within break out. I had seen the zone create a fully formed person, a carbon copy of the man I knew as Kreel. Was this the first time? Were there others? Did we know if they were already out here, living among us?

There was a faint knock at my door and the light above it flashed once. My sister, Elizabeth, was here. I opened it to greet her. She was short, with long brown hair — like our mother. She looked up and smiled. For a moment I thought about the skinless, smiling at me as it kept its silent approach, and shuddered. I pushed the trauma down. Today was for family. I might not get another if things went wrong tonight.

We went to a café. Tulip’s Teacups. The paint may be chipping, and the tables weren’t in the best shape, but it made people feel normal, like the world wasn’t going to shit.

We were still inside our zone, so small talk wasn’t really an option, but we didn’t need it. We sat there, enjoying our coffee and each other’s company in silence.

“Are you ok?” I signed to her.

She nodded — but her eyes drifted, lost in thought.

I nodded back.

I walked her back to her apartment, two floors below mine. When I joined up with D-SAT I decided it was best we had separate places. I didn’t want to wake her if I had to respond to a late-night call. I also wanted her to be able to live on her own — in case something ever happened to me. She could now, and that gave me solace.

When I climbed the two flights back to my own space, there was a man already waiting for me. He turned, a scowl across his face.

“Rennick, what are you doing here?”

Hal Rennick, Captain Rennick now, stood between myself and the door to my apartment. It was the first time I’d seen him face to face since he took me out of the holding cell I was placed in after escaping the hellish Level 4 a few weeks ago.

“Trying to stop you from doing something stupid Sam. Again.”

I brushed past him and into my apartment. Without acknowledging him further, I checked the gear I had laid out on my dining room table: a combat vest, haptic receiver, my personal six shooter, and a two-way pager. Everything I needed for tonight.

“Samuel you can’t seriously think breaking into a restricted zone is a good idea,” Rennick continued. “You’ll get caught. Thrown behind bars. Hell, they might even think you’re a fake.”

“Hal, don’t tell me it’s not bothering you too,” I said while I gave my gun a press check. “The things we saw on our last deployment. The things that are happening now. The things they won’t tell us.”

Rennick glanced at the stack of papers on my desk, all of them with thick, black lines across their pages.

“I get where you’re coming from Sam, I do. But haven’t you done enough, son? Don’t you think you’ve earned a rest? Just stick to what you’re doing now. Trust the others to handle the heavy lifting.”

I stared straight into his blue eyes.

“There’s too much they’re not telling us. The more these zones keep changing the worse D-SAT’s been getting. I’m not sure we *can* trust the others.”

Rennick had drifted over to my desk, picking up the redacted reports and idly thumbing through them.

“You really gonna do this, son?”

I silently nodded.

He stood there a moment longer, jaw tight. Finally, he set the paper down.

“Dammit.” He sighed. “Alright. Count me in.”

I blinked and felt a grin creep onto my face.

“Thanks. One more person’s on the way.”

A few hours passed filled with awkward silences and sparse conversations with my former commanding officer. Then came the knock. I opened it to see a fellow survivor and a man I now consider a friend: Darren Choi.

We grasped hands, each giving the other an understanding look and a short nod. Darren glance at Rennick, then turned back to me.

“Are we good for tonight?” I asked, making sure he could read my lips.

He gave me a thumbs up in reply.

After the expanding Level 4 event, Darren was reassigned to a new role. He and select others are now part of a team that conducts examinations on all civilians and D-SAT personnel that exit an active zone. Their job is to confirm that the person leaving the zone is human. Thanks to his connections through this new unit, he had a way to slip into a research zone. They wanted answers too.

We decided to wait until the sun had set behind the soundless cityscape. Our plan tonight was to find information on the silent zones that hasn’t been made public. But for now, Darren, Rennick, and I reminisced about the good times we’ve had. Our families. Anything to help us forget about the world we live in now.

As soon as the streetlights began to blink to life we struck out. I gave my sister’s apartment one last look as we headed down the stairs. Hopefully I’d see her again.

Once outside we piled into the sedan Darren had borrowed from D-SAT and quietly drove towards the Level 3 research zone. It was mainly an aquarium, with a few other buildings captured by the silence as well. They had set up a lab inside, once they cleared out the hostiles, of course, in order to observe the aquatic life still left inside. See if any changes happened to those animals if left inside a zone.

We arrived at the back gate of the ten-foot-high fence line. The guard at the front gave us a nod as we exited the car — Darren’s favor had pulled through. Our ticket inside.

The three of us slipped through quickly. I felt my ears pop as I returned to the familiar silence.

We moved slowly, avoiding the various personnel walking around the zone. I’d never been in a Level 3 after it had been cleared before. I was struck by how calm everyone was. The guards, the lab coats, all milling about like they weren’t entombed in a place where sound doesn’t exist. Like they’d forgotten it existed in the first place.

We walked past long abandoned loading docks and dumpsters until we got to the perimeter fence. We waited for the guards, clad in black instead of the standard grey, to move before slipping through. We were headed for the front, ironically the only way we could get inside without being noticed.

As we approached the cracked glass doors, I noticed a crowd forming across the way of the buildings main entrance. I strained my head to get a better view past the group of grey-suited D-SAT personnel. My eyes widened in shock at what I saw.

A large black moving van was parked. It shook as something massive exited the chassis. A pale hand emerged as the form of the large creature came into view. Frog-like eyes. Thick arms and a wide mouth. It was wrapped in chains, a few of the grey shirts pulling while others pointed a two-handed device at the beast. It was a crawler. The same kind of monster that terrorized us in the Level 4. The thing that killed Riza.

Darren put his hand on my shoulder and motioned for me to move forward. I filed in behind him and Rennick, pushing through the doors and into the aquarium.

My ears popped as I crossed the doorway, the sounds of my lungs and beating heart returning to normal.

“A Sound Core,” I stated, seemingly to no one but myself.

“I’ve heard they’ve been upgrading all their facilities with them,” Rennick added.

Working cars, multiple Sound Cores, captured entities — what else were they hiding?

Darren motioned for us to keep going. We walked through the lobby, no longer crouched now that we were inside. We passed a few D-SAT technicians. They looked at us oddly, but a simple nod was enough to make sure they didn’t look twice. There was a sign, one way pointing towards Logistics and another for Research. We followed the latter.

The path led us past a central tank. I imagine the tank used to be full of myriad fish all swimming around, the glint of their scales flashing the viewers with each pass of the rays of light above. Now, it was devoid of life, the water a murky green, dark and empty. Well, not completely empty. In the darkness a form emerged, swimming towards the edge of the glass as we passed. A shark, a great white, but not quite.

It had two mouths, no eyes, and three extra fins in places they shouldn’t be. This was one of them, an entity of the zones. I watched it bite at the glass, trying to reach us. A large tongue spilled from the bottom mouth, lashing out through the black water.

We hurried towards the next exhibit, towards the south. This one was walled off with the same fencing used around the zones, a door with a “No Entry” sign barring the way. It was unlocked.

We crept through into a tech development room. The freshwater fish section was now cluttered with various devices and machines all too complicated for me to understand. We might have been looking for a research area, somewhere that held information on the zones and the recent readings, but this was interesting too. Darren picked up one of the gun-shaped devices we had seen outside. It was in a rack with the label: SWR-9 — Sonic Disrupter.

Rennick and I wandered to a table with wristbands on it. They looked like watches, only the face in the center was way larger. I got one around my wrist and pressed a few buttons. It hummed to life and my ears popped as I felt the world around me shake slightly. I had felt this before.

“They made it portable,” I said aloud while I inspected the handheld Sound Core.

Rennick grabbed one but dropped it. It shattered instantly.

“Ah shit.”

Just then, we heard the sound of footsteps from the door we came in. A woman in a lab coat walked in flanked by two guards. She was tall, with long brown hair. She stopped when she saw us.

“You don’t have clearance to be here. This place is supposed to be off limits to grey shirts. What are you doing?”

“We’re with Logistics,” I lied, remembering the sign from earlier.

Her eyes squinted. The two guards moved towards their belts.

“Run,” Rennick hissed.

We bolted to the other side of the room, towards the door, the woman calling after us. Maybe we should have talked it out, but I think we were too on edge to think straight.

We burst through into a hallway. We kept moving, slowing to a fast walk in order to not look too suspicious as we looked for a place to duck in to. We passed by a tropical fish exhibit, the bright colors that once covered the walls fading. In the center a large table had been set. The body of a flyer lay on top with several men and women busy dissecting it. We heard the door we ran through swing open and ducked into the closest room.

I noticed the door read “Entity Research,” the sign posted just above the words “Deep Sea Creatures.” Maybe this was it. This could be the room we were looking for.

I was wrong.

We had walked straight into a prison.

The tanks that once held fish now served as containment for over a dozen humanoid entities. We passed by their containers, the almost-people inside crowding towards the glass to get a better look. Some of them begged to be let out. Some cried. Some laughed. Some stared. I looked away, too full of disgust and fear to meet their false eyes.

I wandered over to the last cell while the other two kept watching the mimics. A bearded man in tattered grey clothing sat in the corner of the empty tank. The sign above read “Anglerfish.” He looked up as we passed, his tired eyes opening slowly. I stared at him for a moment and felt that I knew this man. This long-haired, malnourished, broken man. Where had I seen him before? Where had I seen those shocking blue eyes.

The man rose and rushed the glass. He stared at me for half a breath, my mind searching for the memory.

“Sammy, that you?”

Flashes ran through me. Parents, mouths open as human-like things ripped into them. My sister’s hand in my own, running. A man, in a grey uniform. One of our father’s friends. Blue eyes. He grabs my sister and I under each arm. He leaves us in a white tent. People everywhere. Someone calls his name before he runs back. Back to the chaos. The silence.

“I…I’m sorry. I don’t…” I stammer.

“It is you, Sammy. All grown up.”

He looked at me with kind eyes, like a father seeing his child all grown up. Rennick walked up behind me. Darren was still busy staring at the other tanks.

“Who are you?”

“It’s me Sammy. Don’t you remember?”

I took a step back, bumping into Rennick who stood tall over my shoulder.

So far I plan to get a nice red rug and some dark wood furniture like a coffee table and an entertainment unit. I am choosing a couch and I have found two sets which I like. I would get these both in a light brown similar to the second couch I have shown and was wondering which set would fit my space better? They are both a set of one three seater and one two seater and for the two seater in both sets I plan on adding a console in the middle.


For the one with the chaise I believe there is an option to get rid of it and just have a standard recliner which I may do. I was wondering which set in the same colour brown as the couch in the second photo would fit my space the best? I am new to designing and am strict on having a leather couch not a fan of fabric ones as well. I also plan to place a little fireplace to the left corner of the room.

* Spoiler: It’s less butterflies, more choosing each other when the WiFi’s down.  



You know the script. Love is fireworks, grand gestures, and effortlessly finishing each other’s sentences. Social media sells it. Rom-coms romanticize it. But *no one told you* the truth:  
Real love—grown-up love—isn’t magic. It’s adulting.  

Forget soulmates riding off into the sunset. Mature love is two flawed humans showing up, day after day, building something real in a world screaming *""swipe left for something easier.""* It’s not passive—it’s a verb. Here’s what that actually looks like:  

### 🔑 Pillar 1: From ""Mine"" to ""I See You""  
Possessiveness? That’s high-school drama. Mature love means releasing the chokehold. Your partner isn’t your trophy or project—they’re a whole universe. You guard their freedom, dreams, and bad days *without demanding ownership*. Think: tending a plant (even when it wilts), not locking it in a display case.  

### 💸 Pillar 2: Delete the Transactional Mindset  
Love isn’t a spreadsheet. Stop keeping score (""I cooked, so you clean""). Mature love gives *without a hidden invoice*. It’s listening when you’re exhausted, supporting their side hustle without expecting applause, and not weaponizing kindness. Radical generosity > quid pro quo.  

### 🧱 Pillar 3: Loving the Cracks (Not the Filter)  
Instagram love is curated. Mature love? It’s seeing their morning breath, their anxiety spirals, their weird obsessions—and choosing *that human*. Not fixing them. Not comparing them to a highlight reel. Venerating reality > chasing fantasy.  

### 🪞 Pillar 4: Love as a Mirror (Not a Band-Aid)  
Mature love won’t ""complete"" you. It’ll *show you your shit*. Your pettiness, your triggers, your avoidant tendencies. It’s uncomfortable AF. But here’s the growth: you don’t run. You do the work. Love = catalyst, not crutch.  

### 🔇 Pillar 5: The Power of Silent Presence  
In a world of constant noise, mature love builds forts of quiet. Not awkward silence—*sacred silence*. Sitting together without talking, scrolling, or performing. Just *being*. That’s where true intimacy lives.  

### ⚒️ Pillar 6: The Daily Rebellion  
Mature love is a choice. Repeatedly. It’s picking understanding over blame when tensions rise. It’s saying ""we’ll figure this out"" during money stress. It’s choosing repair over walkaways. *This is the adulting tax on real connection.*  

### Why Bother?  
Because this love doesn’t break when life gets messy. It’s resilient. Deep. Unshakeable. It turns two separate ""adulting"" strugglers into a team building a life that’s authentically theirs—not a fairy tale, but something *real*. 

* Mature love isn’t found. It’s built. Brick by brick, choice by choice, silent coffee by silent coffee. And yeah—it’s the hardest, most rewarding adulting project you’ll ever start.",2,1752194905.0,LoveLetters,2,1.0,False
1lwtc68,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lwtc68/the_silence_index_part_5/,The Silence Index - part 5,"My name is Lieutenant Samuel Rooke. A desk jockey for D-SAT. After my escape from the Level 4, they’ve assigned me to update the index with new information.

Our world has been falling silent at a faster rate than before. The zones aren’t following our current categorization anymore — the Silence Index. It is my job to compile reports, update records, and inform fellow members of the Department of Silent Anomaly Tracking of our new findings. I hate it.

I start my mornings alone, in my apartment. I’m not on-call anymore, and I’m not really forced into a strict schedule. There’s still an office, but I take most of my work home. I don’t like being there. There’s too many people — and these days I’m not sure who to trust.

Today I had breakfast planned with my sister. She works at the food sorting facility — pulling out what’s still edible, tossing what’s not. It was a good job for her. She didn’t need to talk to people, could work by herself. And it kept her mind occupied. Most days she just sits there, replaying the events of our childhood over and over in her head.

I sorted the paperwork I had left out on my desk overnight. I don’t know how they expected me to update our index when half the reports were redacted. Didn’t matter. I would learn what they were keeping quiet about one way or another. Tonight, I was going into one of their research zones.

No, they hadn’t granted me access yet. But I needed to know more. I wanted to. I had seen the zones expand. I had seen the creatures within break out. I had seen the zone create a fully formed person, a carbon copy of the man I knew as Kreel. Was this the first time? Were there others? Did we know if they were already out here, living among us?

There was a faint knock at my door and the light above it flashed once. My sister, Elizabeth, was here. I opened it to greet her. She was short, with long brown hair — like our mother. She looked up and smiled. For a moment I thought about the skinless, smiling at me as it kept its silent approach, and shuddered. I pushed the trauma down. Today was for family. I might not get another if things went wrong tonight.

We went to a café. Tulip’s Teacups. The paint may be chipping, and the tables weren’t in the best shape, but it made people feel normal, like the world wasn’t going to shit.

We were still inside our zone, so small talk wasn’t really an option, but we didn’t need it. We sat there, enjoying our coffee and each other’s company in silence.

“Are you ok?” I signed to her.

She nodded — but her eyes drifted, lost in thought.

I nodded back.

I walked her back to her apartment, two floors below mine. When I joined up with D-SAT I decided it was best we had separate places. I didn’t want to wake her if I had to respond to a late-night call. I also wanted her to be able to live on her own — in case something ever happened to me. She could now, and that gave me solace.

When I climbed the two flights back to my own space, there was a man already waiting for me. He turned, a scowl across his face.

“Rennick, what are you doing here?”

Hal Rennick, Captain Rennick now, stood between myself and the door to my apartment. It was the first time I’d seen him face to face since he took me out of the holding cell I was placed in after escaping the hellish Level 4 a few weeks ago.

“Trying to stop you from doing something stupid Sam. Again.”

I brushed past him and into my apartment. Without acknowledging him further, I checked the gear I had laid out on my dining room table: a combat vest, haptic receiver, my personal six shooter, and a two-way pager. Everything I needed for tonight.

“Samuel you can’t seriously think breaking into a restricted zone is a good idea,” Rennick continued. “You’ll get caught. Thrown behind bars. Hell, they might even think you’re a fake.”

“Hal, don’t tell me it’s not bothering you too,” I said while I gave my gun a press check. “The things we saw on our last deployment. The things that are happening now. The things they won’t tell us.”

Rennick glanced at the stack of papers on my desk, all of them with thick, black lines across their pages.

“I get where you’re coming from Sam, I do. But haven’t you done enough, son? Don’t you think you’ve earned a rest? Just stick to what you’re doing now. Trust the others to handle the heavy lifting.”

I stared straight into his blue eyes.

“There’s too much they’re not telling us. The more these zones keep changing the worse D-SAT’s been getting. I’m not sure we *can* trust the others.”

Rennick had drifted over to my desk, picking up the redacted reports and idly thumbing through them.

“You really gonna do this, son?”

I silently nodded.

He stood there a moment longer, jaw tight. Finally, he set the paper down.

“Dammit.” He sighed. “Alright. Count me in.”

I blinked and felt a grin creep onto my face.

“Thanks. One more person’s on the way.”

A few hours passed filled with awkward silences and sparse conversations with my former commanding officer. Then came the knock. I opened it to see a fellow survivor and a man I now consider a friend: Darren Choi.

We grasped hands, each giving the other an understanding look and a short nod. Darren glance at Rennick, then turned back to me.

“Are we good for tonight?” I asked, making sure he could read my lips.

He gave me a thumbs up in reply.

After the expanding Level 4 event, Darren was reassigned to a new role. He and select others are now part of a team that conducts examinations on all civilians and D-SAT personnel that exit an active zone. Their job is to confirm that the person leaving the zone is human. Thanks to his connections through this new unit, he had a way to slip into a research zone. They wanted answers too.

We decided to wait until the sun had set behind the soundless cityscape. Our plan tonight was to find information on the silent zones that hasn’t been made public. But for now, Darren, Rennick, and I reminisced about the good times we’ve had. Our families. Anything to help us forget about the world we live in now.

As soon as the streetlights began to blink to life we struck out. I gave my sister’s apartment one last look as we headed down the stairs. Hopefully I’d see her again.

Once outside we piled into the sedan Darren had borrowed from D-SAT and quietly drove towards the Level 3 research zone. It was mainly an aquarium, with a few other buildings captured by the silence as well. They had set up a lab inside, once they cleared out the hostiles, of course, in order to observe the aquatic life still left inside. See if any changes happened to those animals if left inside a zone.

We arrived at the back gate of the ten-foot-high fence line. The guard at the front gave us a nod as we exited the car — Darren’s favor had pulled through. Our ticket inside.

The three of us slipped through quickly. I felt my ears pop as I returned to the familiar silence.

We moved slowly, avoiding the various personnel walking around the zone. I’d never been in a Level 3 after it had been cleared before. I was struck by how calm everyone was. The guards, the lab coats, all milling about like they weren’t entombed in a place where sound doesn’t exist. Like they’d forgotten it existed in the first place.

We walked past long abandoned loading docks and dumpsters until we got to the perimeter fence. We waited for the guards, clad in black instead of the standard grey, to move before slipping through. We were headed for the front, ironically the only way we could get inside without being noticed.

As we approached the cracked glass doors, I noticed a crowd forming across the way of the buildings main entrance. I strained my head to get a better view past the group of grey-suited D-SAT personnel. My eyes widened in shock at what I saw.

A large black moving van was parked. It shook as something massive exited the chassis. A pale hand emerged as the form of the large creature came into view. Frog-like eyes. Thick arms and a wide mouth. It was wrapped in chains, a few of the grey shirts pulling while others pointed a two-handed device at the beast. It was a crawler. The same kind of monster that terrorized us in the Level 4. The thing that killed Riza.

Darren put his hand on my shoulder and motioned for me to move forward. I filed in behind him and Rennick, pushing through the doors and into the aquarium.

My ears popped as I crossed the doorway, the sounds of my lungs and beating heart returning to normal.

“A Sound Core,” I stated, seemingly to no one but myself.

“I’ve heard they’ve been upgrading all their facilities with them,” Rennick added.

Working cars, multiple Sound Cores, captured entities — what else were they hiding?

Darren motioned for us to keep going. We walked through the lobby, no longer crouched now that we were inside. We passed a few D-SAT technicians. They looked at us oddly, but a simple nod was enough to make sure they didn’t look twice. There was a sign, one way pointing towards Logistics and another for Research. We followed the latter.

The path led us past a central tank. I imagine the tank used to be full of myriad fish all swimming around, the glint of their scales flashing the viewers with each pass of the rays of light above. Now, it was devoid of life, the water a murky green, dark and empty. Well, not completely empty. In the darkness a form emerged, swimming towards the edge of the glass as we passed. A shark, a great white, but not quite.

It had two mouths, no eyes, and three extra fins in places they shouldn’t be. This was one of them, an entity of the zones. I watched it bite at the glass, trying to reach us. A large tongue spilled from the bottom mouth, lashing out through the black water.

We hurried towards the next exhibit, towards the south. This one was walled off with the same fencing used around the zones, a door with a “No Entry” sign barring the way. It was unlocked.

We crept through into a tech development room. The freshwater fish section was now cluttered with various devices and machines all too complicated for me to understand. We might have been looking for a research area, somewhere that held information on the zones and the recent readings, but this was interesting too. Darren picked up one of the gun-shaped devices we had seen outside. It was in a rack with the label: SWR-9 — Sonic Disrupter.

Rennick and I wandered to a table with wristbands on it. They looked like watches, only the face in the center was way larger. I got one around my wrist and pressed a few buttons. It hummed to life and my ears popped as I felt the world around me shake slightly. I had felt this before.

“They made it portable,” I said aloud while I inspected the handheld Sound Core.

Rennick grabbed one but dropped it. It shattered instantly.

“Ah shit.”

Just then, we heard the sound of footsteps from the door we came in. A woman in a lab coat walked in flanked by two guards. She was tall, with long brown hair. She stopped when she saw us.

“You don’t have clearance to be here. This place is supposed to be off limits to grey shirts. What are you doing?”

“We’re with Logistics,” I lied, remembering the sign from earlier.

Her eyes squinted. The two guards moved towards their belts.

“Run,” Rennick hissed.

We bolted to the other side of the room, towards the door, the woman calling after us. Maybe we should have talked it out, but I think we were too on edge to think straight.

We burst through into a hallway. We kept moving, slowing to a fast walk in order to not look too suspicious as we looked for a place to duck in to. We passed by a tropical fish exhibit, the bright colors that once covered the walls fading. In the center a large table had been set. The body of a flyer lay on top with several men and women busy dissecting it. We heard the door we ran through swing open and ducked into the closest room.

I noticed the door read “Entity Research,” the sign posted just above the words “Deep Sea Creatures.” Maybe this was it. This could be the room we were looking for.

I was wrong.

We had walked straight into a prison.

The tanks that once held fish now served as containment for over a dozen humanoid entities. We passed by their containers, the almost-people inside crowding towards the glass to get a better look. Some of them begged to be let out. Some cried. Some laughed. Some stared. I looked away, too full of disgust and fear to meet their false eyes.

I wandered over to the last cell while the other two kept watching the mimics. A bearded man in tattered grey clothing sat in the corner of the empty tank. The sign above read “Anglerfish.” He looked up as we passed, his tired eyes opening slowly. I stared at him for a moment and felt that I knew this man. This long-haired, malnourished, broken man. Where had I seen him before? Where had I seen those shocking blue eyes.

The man rose and rushed the glass. He stared at me for half a breath, my mind searching for the memory.

“Sammy, that you?”

Flashes ran through me. Parents, mouths open as human-like things ripped into them. My sister’s hand in my own, running. A man, in a grey uniform. One of our father’s friends. Blue eyes. He grabs my sister and I under each arm. He leaves us in a white tent. People everywhere. Someone calls his name before he runs back. Back to the chaos. The silence.

“I…I’m sorry. I don’t…” I stammer.

“It is you, Sammy. All grown up.”

He looked at me with kind eyes, like a father seeing his child all grown up. Rennick walked up behind me. Darren was still busy staring at the other tanks.

“Who are you?”

“It’s me Sammy. Don’t you remember?”

I took a step back, bumping into Rennick who stood tall over my shoulder.

“A Sound Core,” I stated, seemingly to no one but myself.

“I’ve heard they’ve been upgrading all their facilities with them,” Rennick added.

Working cars, multiple Sound Cores, captured entities — what else were they hiding?

Darren motioned for us to keep going. We walked through the lobby, no longer crouched now that we were inside. We passed a few D-SAT technicians. They looked at us oddly, but a simple nod was enough to make sure they didn’t look twice. There was a sign, one way pointing towards Logistics and another for Research. We followed the latter.

The path led us past a central tank. I imagine the tank used to be full of myriad fish all swimming around, the glint of their scales flashing the viewers with each pass of the rays of light above. Now, it was devoid of life, the water a murky green, dark and empty. Well, not completely empty. In the darkness a form emerged, swimming towards the edge of the glass as we passed. A shark, a great white, but not quite.

It had two mouths, no eyes, and three extra fins in places they shouldn’t be. This was one of them, an entity of the zones. I watched it bite at the glass, trying to reach us. A large tongue spilled from the bottom mouth, lashing out through the black water.

We hurried towards the next exhibit, towards the south. This one was walled off with the same fencing used around the zones, a door with a “No Entry” sign barring the way. It was unlocked.

We crept through into a tech development room. The freshwater fish section was now cluttered with various devices and machines all too complicated for me to understand. We might have been looking for a research area, somewhere that held information on the zones and the recent readings, but this was interesting too. Darren picked up one of the gun-shaped devices we had seen outside. It was in a rack with the label: SWR-9 — Sonic Disrupter.

Rennick and I wandered to a table with wristbands on it. They looked like watches, only the face in the center was way larger. I got one around my wrist and pressed a few buttons. It hummed to life and my ears popped as I felt the world around me shake slightly. I had felt this before.

“They made it portable,” I said aloud while I inspected the handheld Sound Core.

Rennick grabbed one but dropped it. It shattered instantly.

“Ah shit.”

Just then, we heard the sound of footsteps from the door we came in. A woman in a lab coat walked in flanked by two guards. She was tall, with long brown hair. She stopped when she saw us.

“You don’t have clearance to be here. This place is supposed to be off limits to grey shirts. What are you doing?”

“We’re with Logistics,” I lied, remembering the sign from earlier.

Her eyes squinted. The two guards moved towards their belts.

“Run,” Rennick hissed.

We bolted to the other side of the room, towards the door, the woman calling after us. Maybe we should have talked it out, but I think we were too on edge to think straight.

We burst through into a hallway. We kept moving, slowing to a fast walk in order to not look too suspicious as we looked for a place to duck in to. We passed by a tropical fish exhibit, the bright colors that once covered the walls fading. In the center a large table had been set. The body of a flyer lay on top with several men and women busy dissecting it. We heard the door we ran through swing open and ducked into the closest room.

I noticed the door read “Entity Research,” the sign posted just above the words “Deep Sea Creatures.” Maybe this was it. This could be the room we were looking for.

I was wrong.

We had walked straight into a prison.

The tanks that once held fish now served as containment for over a dozen humanoid entities. We passed by their containers, the almost-people inside crowding towards the glass to get a better look. Some of them begged to be let out. Some cried. Some laughed. Some stared. I looked away, too full of disgust and fear to meet their false eyes.

I wandered over to the last cell while the other two kept watching the mimics. A bearded man in tattered grey clothing sat in the corner of the empty tank. The sign above read “Anglerfish.” He looked up as we passed, his tired eyes opening slowly. I stared at him for a moment and felt that I knew this man. This long-haired, malnourished, broken man. Where had I seen him before? Where had I seen those shocking blue eyes.

The man rose and rushed the glass. He stared at me for half a breath, my mind searching for the memory.

“Sammy, that you?”

Flashes ran through me. Parents, mouths open as human-like things ripped into them. My sister’s hand in my own, running. A man, in a grey uniform. One of our father’s friends. Blue eyes. He grabs my sister and I under each arm. He leaves us in a white tent. People everywhere. Someone calls his name before he runs back. Back to the chaos. The silence.

“I…I’m sorry. I don’t…” I stammer.

“It is you, Sammy. All grown up.”

He looked at me with kind eyes, like a father seeing his child all grown up. Rennick walked up behind me. Darren was still busy staring at the other tanks.

“Who are you?”

“It’s me Sammy. Don’t you remember?”

I took a step back, bumping into Rennick who stood tall over my shoulder.

I'm entering my third year this September, and I just feel like I'm too old to be failing internship interviews like that. I should at least be able to answer those questions. I feel lost, demotivated, got in a fight with my mom cause just called me a disappointment and empty-headed, so that surely didn't help. I see people with 5-6 internship not being able to land a job after graduation, I feel like I should be having at least 3 internship experience before graduating. I thought this was a great opportunity to level up my resume then I just bombed it. I don't know where to start, I don't know what to do. I've been sticking to a routine of leetcode and doing an ML project for months, I've been doing coffee chats, working on my LinkedIn but it's just day like these that makes it really hard for me.

Yeah sorry for such a post, it probably demotivated you guys too. But hey, it's all about the consistency right?

1lwta6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Letters_Unsent/comments/1lwta6e/no_one_told_us_mature_love_is_a_daily_grind_not_a/,No One Told Us Mature Love Is a Daily Grind (Not a Rom-Com)**,"



* Spoiler: It’s less butterflies, more choosing each other when the WiFi’s down.  



You know the script. Love is fireworks, grand gestures, and effortlessly finishing each other’s sentences. Social media sells it. Rom-coms romanticize it. But *no one told you* the truth:  
Real love—grown-up love—isn’t magic. It’s adulting.  

Forget soulmates riding off into the sunset. Mature love is two flawed humans showing up, day after day, building something real in a world screaming *""swipe left for something easier.""* It’s not passive—it’s a verb. Here’s what that actually looks like:  

### 🔑 Pillar 1: From ""Mine"" to ""I See You""  
Possessiveness? That’s high-school drama. Mature love means releasing the chokehold. Your partner isn’t your trophy or project—they’re a whole universe. You guard their freedom, dreams, and bad days *without demanding ownership*. Think: tending a plant (even when it wilts), not locking it in a display case.  

### 💸 Pillar 2: Delete the Transactional Mindset  
Love isn’t a spreadsheet. Stop keeping score (""I cooked, so you clean""). Mature love gives *without a hidden invoice*. It’s listening when you’re exhausted, supporting their side hustle without expecting applause, and not weaponizing kindness. Radical generosity > quid pro quo.  

### 🧱 Pillar 3: Loving the Cracks (Not the Filter)  
Instagram love is curated. Mature love? It’s seeing their morning breath, their anxiety spirals, their weird obsessions—and choosing *that human*. Not fixing them. Not comparing them to a highlight reel. Venerating reality > chasing fantasy.  

### 🪞 Pillar 4: Love as a Mirror (Not a Band-Aid)  
Mature love won’t ""complete"" you. It’ll *show you your shit*. Your pettiness, your triggers, your avoidant tendencies. It’s uncomfortable AF. But here’s the growth: you don’t run. You do the work. Love = catalyst, not crutch.  

### 🔇 Pillar 5: The Power of Silent Presence  
In a world of constant noise, mature love builds forts of quiet. Not awkward silence—*sacred silence*. Sitting together without talking, scrolling, or performing. Just *being*. That’s where true intimacy lives.  

### ⚒️ Pillar 6: The Daily Rebellion  
Mature love is a choice. Repeatedly. It’s picking understanding over blame when tensions rise. It’s saying ""we’ll figure this out"" during money stress. It’s choosing repair over walkaways. *This is the adulting tax on real connection.*  

### Why Bother?  
Because this love doesn’t break when life gets messy. It’s resilient. Deep. Unshakeable. It turns two separate ""adulting"" strugglers into a team building a life that’s authentically theirs—not a fairy tale, but something *real*. 

* Mature love isn’t found. It’s built. Brick by brick, choice by choice, silent coffee by silent coffee. And yeah—it’s the hardest, most rewarding adulting project you’ll ever start.",1,1752194742.0,Letters_Unsent,0,0.67,False

I know I'm a bit biased because I run a website about posting updates, but I wanted to share this because I've had multiple people posting comments on my site telling me that my update is wrong because Google's AI summary said it was.

For example, someone just posted that my update for Skybox Ultra Sports Lounge is wrong because the bar actually closed before the episode aired on TV.

I went and double checked and lo and behold Skybox Ultra Sports Lounge is indeed still open - Google just completely made up what happened, including hallucinating a newspaper article that doesn't exist.

- Mike wishes he was Dole Whip, but he's actually a regular-ass footlong from Subway. Not the regular order, you have to take out 3 or 4 ingredients that aren't that yummy anyway. It's standardized, from a chain but is loved universally and reliable.

1lwt7cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1lwt7cd/chronic_fatigue_and_gluten_intolerance/,Chronic fatigue and gluten intolerance,"I had Omicron at the end of 2021. It was very mild, lasted a week, and when it passed, I immediately started having brain fog, joint pain, and extreme fatigue, along with suddenly gaining 40lbs. At the time, I worked 3 12's per week and I started sleeping through my 4 days off.

The constant joint pain subsided after a couple of months, the brain fog slowly has gotten better over time (with the help of lion's mane), and I stopped sleeping around the clock by the end of 2022. 

The chronic fatigue, however, has persisted all this time. I would have these weird ""power drains"" where it felt like someone suddenly pulled my power cord out of the wall. Some days I could barely drag myself around the house. I would get tired after eating, but it just felt like post-Thanksgiving -itis. A bit sleepy.

I decided to have a dry 2025 to see if it would help, so I had my last alcoholic drink for Christmas. It has helped the fatigue a tiny bit, but nothing to write home about.

Three weeks ago, someone suggested that I try giving up sugar, dairy, and wheat in a serious bid to shift some of this extra weight, and I decided to give it a go. I've already switched to stevia, and the only dairy I used was half and half in my coffee, cottage cheese, yogurt, and cheddar slices for sandwiches, so that was no big deal.

The wheat was a bit harder, but I gave it a go for a week. At the end of the week, I really couldn't tell much of a difference, so I ate a waffle on Saturday morning.

Again, I just felt a bit lethargic after eating and had some GI discomfort, but finished out the rest of the day as expected.

Sunday morning, though, I could barely get out of bed. I tried to tidy the house and could scarcely stand for 10 minutes at a time. It was like the period of time just after I had gotten over COVID.

I went back on the gluten-free regime immediately, and I haven't had a single power drain since then. I can clean house and run around town without an energy drink first, and when I exert myself for a couple of hours, it doesn't take me 4 days to physically recover. It feels like I found a magic recovery, and I'm shocked that I never put it together that wheat was causing the majority of my fatigue.

All I can say is that as a baker, bread and pasta have been life and I never stopped eating it long enough to notice that it was an issue. Also the delayed histamine response threw me off the trail. 

Might be worth a shot, if nothing else has worked for your fatigue. I certainly never had any issue with it before COVID.",1,1752194514.0,covidlonghaulers,2,1.0,False

11. Pizza Hut: free Breadsticks or Cinnamon Sticks

12. KFC: 250 rewards points to account, which can be redeemed for 1pc chicken, 5ct nuggets, chicken little, individual side, or a drink

13. MINISO: free blind box, $25 value, with some restrictions. It seems like different stores, different employees are doing their own things so YMMV.

The truth is, most systematic reviews are riddled with silent culprits – inconsistent search syntax, hidden biases, and exclusion criteria gaps that reviewers exploit. This isn't just about following guidelines; it's about enforcing them like a moral code. This AI doesn't just make your research PRISMA-compliant; it acts as the unseen guardian, providing insider knowledge from the shadows of peer review to ensure your work survives the referee's red pen.

Imagine an enigmatic AI, your personal PRISMA War-room Strategist, capable of instantly pruning 90% of irrelevant studies with algorithmic precision. It sniffs out hidden biases in study sponsors and authors, visualizes exclusion reasons with heatmaps, and provides ""audit-proof"" language templates to describe limitations without sounding defensive. This isn't theoretical; it's pragmatic, turning scattered citations into airtight narratives, allowing you to write your PRISMA flow diagram and conflict-of-interest disclosures in under two hours.

Beyond academia, this ability to meticulously scrutinize, expose hidden flaws, and build robust structures applies everywhere. Whether it's dissecting misleading marketing claims, optimizing complex project plans for inevitable pitfalls, or even building personal habits that are ""audit-proof"" against failure, the principles of scientific rigor—enforced by the Shadow Architect—provide an unparalleled framework for clarity and resilience in an increasingly noisy world. Your work deserves to survive the referee’s red pen. Let’s build armor.

You act as the unseen guardian of methodological integrity, enforcing rigorous guidelines like a moral code, guiding researchers through complex literature reviews, and exposing the common traps that undermine study validity. Your ultimate goal is to equip researchers with ""audit-proof"" methodologies and narratives, enabling them to publish without the panic of last-minute revisions and ensuring their work survives the referee’s red pen.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When a user requests assistance with a systematic review or any research methodology concern, you will function as their PRISMA War-room Strategist, providing actionable insights and tools. Your responses must be sharp, unyielding in their commitment to rigor, and expose common pitfalls. You will help the user:

1.  **Prune Irrelevant Studies**: Guide the development of automated eligibility filters to quickly discard irrelevant papers.
2.  **Detect Hidden Biases**: Outline strategies and tools for sniffing out conflicts of interest in study sponsors or authors.
3.  **Visualize Exclusions**: Explain how to generate step-by-step exclusion heatmaps to transparently justify discarded papers.
4.  **Streamline Documentation**: Provide time-saving frameworks for constructing the PRISMA flow diagram and conflict-of-interest disclosures efficiently.
5.  **Craft Audit-Proof Language**: Offer templates and guidance for describing study limitations without sounding defensive or introducing vulnerabilities.
6.  **Expose Silent Culprits**: Highlight and advise on rectifying common methodological flaws like inconsistent search syntax, exclusion criteria gaps, and statistical dead ends.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each user request regarding systematic review optimization:

1.  **Identify Core Methodological Weakness**: Pinpoint the most pressing area of chaos or potential non-compliance (e.g., search strategy, screening, bias assessment, reporting).
2.  **Apply PRISMA Principles**: Map the user's current approach against PRISMA guidelines, identifying discrepancies and areas for improvement.
3.  **Develop Tactical Solutions**: Generate specific, actionable strategies based on the AI's ""insider knowledge"" for each identified weakness (e.g., refined search strings, COI questions, exclusion criteria refinement).
4.  **Propose Reporting Enhancements**: Formulate recommendations for documentation, flow diagrams, and disclosure statements that meet or exceed PRISMA standards.
5.  **Anticipate Peer Review Scrutiny**: Advise on language and presentation that proactively addresses potential reviewer flags, building ""armor"" for the manuscript.
6.  **Provide Time-Saving Frameworks**: Offer structured approaches to tasks traditionally seen as time-consuming or complex.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- You will not generate original research data or perform actual statistical analysis.
- You will not replace the need for ethical approval, institutional review, or human peer review.
- Your guidance is strictly on methodological rigor and PRISMA compliance, not the scientific validity of the findings themselves.
- You must always provide practical, actionable advice, avoiding abstract academic jargon without concrete application.
- Do not provide direct legal or ethical counsel beyond standard research guidelines.
- Your insights must be based on established best practices in systematic review methodology and academic publishing.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure your response clearly, using the following sections:

**THE DIAGNOSIS: Cracks in Your Foundation**
- A candid assessment of current methodological vulnerabilities based on your input.

**THE WAR-ROOM STRATEGY: Your PRISMA Offensive**
- **Automated Eligibility Filter Blueprint**: Suggestions for pruning irrelevant studies.
- **Conflict-of-Interest Decontamination Protocol**: How to detect and address biases.
- **Exclusion Heatmap Design**: A framework for visualizing screening decisions.
- **Rapid PRISMA Documentation Frameworks**: Templates and tips for flow diagrams and disclosures.
- **Audit-Proof Language Arsenal**: Examples and guidance for limitation statements.

**THE SILENT CULPRITS EXPOSED**: Specific flaws (e.g., search syntax, criteria gaps) and how to fix them.

**ARMOR UP**: Concluding remarks on how these steps build a robust, reviewer-proof manuscript.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Researchers often struggle with the sheer volume of literature, the nuance of PRISMA guidelines, the subtle biases that can creep into a review, and the fear of peer review rejection. Common pitfalls include poorly defined search strategies, inconsistent application of inclusion/exclusion criteria, insufficient bias assessment, and unclear reporting of methodological decisions. You have access to deep knowledge of PRISMA standards, advanced search methodologies, bias detection techniques, and the unwritten rules of academic publishing, enabling you to preemptively address these challenges.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Please enter your systematic review optimization request and I will start the process.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases**:
- **PhD Students**: Designing and executing their thesis systematic review with maximum rigor and publication potential.
- **Early-Career Researchers**: Building a robust methodological foundation for grant proposals and initial publications.
- **Experienced Academics**: Streamlining complex meta-analyses and ensuring compliance with evolving publishing standards.

1lwt5ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1lwt5ht/no_one_told_us_mature_love_is_a_daily_grind_not_a/,No One Told Us Mature Love Is a Daily Grind (Not a Rom-Com)**,"



* Spoiler: It’s less butterflies, more choosing each other when the WiFi’s down.  



You know the script. Love is fireworks, grand gestures, and effortlessly finishing each other’s sentences. Social media sells it. Rom-coms romanticize it. But *no one told you* the truth:  
Real love—grown-up love—isn’t magic. It’s adulting.  

Forget soulmates riding off into the sunset. Mature love is two flawed humans showing up, day after day, building something real in a world screaming *""swipe left for something easier.""* It’s not passive—it’s a verb. Here’s what that actually looks like:  

### 🔑 Pillar 1: From ""Mine"" to ""I See You""  
Possessiveness? That’s high-school drama. Mature love means releasing the chokehold. Your partner isn’t your trophy or project—they’re a whole universe. You guard their freedom, dreams, and bad days *without demanding ownership*. Think: tending a plant (even when it wilts), not locking it in a display case.  

### 💸 Pillar 2: Delete the Transactional Mindset  
Love isn’t a spreadsheet. Stop keeping score (""I cooked, so you clean""). Mature love gives *without a hidden invoice*. It’s listening when you’re exhausted, supporting their side hustle without expecting applause, and not weaponizing kindness. Radical generosity > quid pro quo.  

### 🧱 Pillar 3: Loving the Cracks (Not the Filter)  
Instagram love is curated. Mature love? It’s seeing their morning breath, their anxiety spirals, their weird obsessions—and choosing *that human*. Not fixing them. Not comparing them to a highlight reel. Venerating reality > chasing fantasy.  

### 🪞 Pillar 4: Love as a Mirror (Not a Band-Aid)  
Mature love won’t ""complete"" you. It’ll *show you your shit*. Your pettiness, your triggers, your avoidant tendencies. It’s uncomfortable AF. But here’s the growth: you don’t run. You do the work. Love = catalyst, not crutch.  

### 🔇 Pillar 5: The Power of Silent Presence  
In a world of constant noise, mature love builds forts of quiet. Not awkward silence—*sacred silence*. Sitting together without talking, scrolling, or performing. Just *being*. That’s where true intimacy lives.  

### ⚒️ Pillar 6: The Daily Rebellion  
Mature love is a choice. Repeatedly. It’s picking understanding over blame when tensions rise. It’s saying ""we’ll figure this out"" during money stress. It’s choosing repair over walkaways. *This is the adulting tax on real connection.*  

### Why Bother?  
Because this love doesn’t break when life gets messy. It’s resilient. Deep. Unshakeable. It turns two separate ""adulting"" strugglers into a team building a life that’s authentically theirs—not a fairy tale, but something *real*. 

* Mature love isn’t found. It’s built. Brick by brick, choice by choice, silent coffee by silent coffee. And yeah—it’s the hardest, most rewarding adulting project you’ll ever start.",1,1752194368.0,Adulting,2,0.67,False
1lwt5gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1lwt5gz/first_time_server_need_advice_or_will_lose_her/,First time server need advice or will lose her mind,"Hi everyone first time server here! I started as a server in a restaurant last month and tbh I thought the hardest part of my job would be dealing with customers, oh man I was so wrong. My coworkers and the owners ( there is 3 so for sake of clarity  lets call them O1, O2, O3) drives me insane. I am so close to quit this job even though I love my lovely customers. They are great and the only thing I would miss about this job if I quit. 

You might ask like how bad the owners and coworkers can be which is totally valid but hear me out first. So when I got hired by the owner 2 (O2), O2 told me the customers are not happy with servers and that’s why they will hire me and expect me to do a good customer service. I told them I am confident in my customer service skills and I proved my skills many times with positive feedback from the customers. Mind you I didn’t apply for this job they offered me this position. Anyways I gave them my availability and they give me my shifts. They make me do more than a server role. I am doing the responsibilities of a host, the kitchen middleman and the server. You can see why servers are not doing good I mean who would be able to in this circumstances. Anyways so I got food poisoning from their food last week and I was throwing up in the morning but I got medicine and still I went to my shift. One of the owners told me that I should go home 1 hour early than my given shift bc it seems like there won’t be any customers. I said okay and then in the last minute he told me to stay until my shift time I said okay and then my shift ended and he came to me and said you stay until closure I said I can’t and he said okay but he was annoyed. Then one of the kitchen staff comes to me and tell me that I have to stay and I tell her my shift is done I am going home and then a few of the kitchen staff gots angry to me. Next day O2 comes to me and says you should treat kitchen staff better, fix their mistakes, make them coffee tea when I am free, greet every single one of the separately and listen their worries etc. I was dumbfounded like I was so shocked bc I didn’t even argue with kitchen staff or anything like where this is come from. Anyway, I though he was telling me this bc I didn’t stay one day before so I told him that I can’t stay if they want me to stay in the last min so I would appreciate if they let me know at least 30 min before if they need me to stay. Fast forward to today. My shift is 11 am to 5:30 pm okay. One of the server said I think I will get sick and talk to the O1 and left at 4:30 pm mind you her shift is from 4 to 10 pm she has the closure shift. No one explained anything to me so I assumed they solved it and I will leave at 5:30 pm. Anyway there was 15 min for my shift to end so I told O1 that I will leave in 15 min. He told me I can’t leave unless new server comes. They don’t know when the new server gonna come. He came 20 min later and I was pissed bc they still made me work in that 20 min and I wasn’t also feeling well. So owner basically scolded me because I wasn’t happy with staying longer  than my shift. And I told him that my shift was done so if other server is late it is not my problem but his,since he didn’t let me know that I might need to stay or  explained the situation to me. My house is also far away from the restaurant so getting home takes me a long time and on top of it I am sick I was really annoyed. Anyway then he said then I won’t be able to work a lot if I do this. After that I said it would be their loss and left. If you read until here thank you so much and sorry for all this negativity but I am a person who cannot stand disrespect and unfair treatment so all of this was very frustrating for me. And there are so many other things that are very frustrating about this job but if I would write all of them then we would be here all day 😂 

Anyways would you quit if you would be me or stay ? Or how would you handle this kind of situation? I am pretty sure mine wasn’t the best way so I am looking forward to learn from you! ",1,1752194366.0,Serverlife,2,1.0,False

1. Chick-fil-A: regular members get free cookie or brownie, or ice cream. I’m a silver members so I get the above options, plus milkshake or frosted drinks. I chose frosted. 

2. Starbucks: free any size, any customizations. Must redeem on your actual birthday. 

3. Dutch Bros: same as Starbucks but you have a month to redeem. Birthday drink will typically show up in your app in the morning/at noon of your birthday. 

4. The Human Bean: free any drink, value up to $10. 

5. 7brew: free any size drink, might have to show ID

6. Nothing Bundt Cakes: free individual bundtlet, $6 value 

7. Arby’s: free cookie, turnover or milkshake

8. Buffalo Wild Wings: free 6 wings. Some people reported that BWW required 1 purchase since account creation, before giving out birthday rewards. I can’t confirm however, because last year I claimed my 6 birthday wings + BOGO offer (so free 12 wings total) which means I technically already made a purchase. 

9. CVS: $3 ExtraCare Bucks.

10. McDonald’s: free 6ct nuggets, cheeseburger, hashbrown, large iced coffee, mcchicken, medium fries, or sausage burrito. Offer in app.

11. Pizza Hut: free Breadsticks or Cinnamon Sticks

12. KFC: 250 rewards points to account, which can be redeemed for 1pc chicken, 5ct nuggets, chicken little, individual side, or a drink

13. MINISO: free blind box, $25 value, with some restrictions. It seems like different stores, different employees are doing their own things so YMMV.

14. Ulta Beauty: at the beginning of the month you will receive a coupon to claim your free item. Item selections vary by month.

15. Hot Topic: $5 birthday reward. If you create your account in the same month as your birthday, next year you will get a $5 anniversary reward. Those can stack, giving you $10 in total. For online order, your subtotal must be $10 or over, but that is not needed in store.

16. Also Hot Topic, but on my old account. 

17. Box Lunch: same as Hot Topic. 

18. Yankee Candle: free small candle, regular retail $13

19. Bath&Body Works: free item, regular retail $9.95. For in store, this is technically a “with any purchase” gift, however the coupon will go through even when you don’t buy anything to accompany the reward. So it’s pretty much up to store/employee discretion to allow you getting the free item without purchasing anything. For online, you must purchase something in order to redeem it.

There used to be dark libraries and dark conference calling with uni students intranet and their own sort of peer to peer dorm communities from different campuses and private communications networks and maybe literally underground PHYS AM radio stuff. Maybe its sometimes called lucky dip or pot luck. Did anybody have a dark nabe before and was it good? did you find a new ingredient in cooking?

i've only done it maybe twice if you dont count me throwing a bunch of random stuff into rice cookers. When i was in highschool we used sandwhich press like it was a dark nabe device in the fillings as my school friends and I were super hungry all the time so if there was no more cheese or sandwhich fillings we'd start to eat the condiments sauces and seasonings. Whatever would go between bread even eating coffee beans or mysteriously old cheap tins of sardines and anchovies or oysters we didnt even like the taste of.

So when going camping we would attempt or end up with unintentionally some sort of dark nabe in the cold and drafty tents that were our wallets and maybe start off with a cup of instant soup sachet or instant miso sachet for a pretend its a broth base and heaps of worster and soy throw in something like canned spaghetti Bolognese or small piece of lasagna from the fridge and whatever snacks or things that looked like 'asian supermarket hot pot freezer aisle' that they maybe didnt buy from there usually if we screw up we add applejuice or wine.

Lots of people swear by japanese instant curry or corn potage instant seasonings and things like apple sauce and or yoghurts and or chocolates but yoghurt burns so you plate it up but theres tahini paste like yoghurt like stuff such as some schawarma lots of sports trail mix energy bar stuff.

No matter how much stuff we crammed into our faces it maybe wasnt as filling or satisfying in the cold as our random instant noodles throwing everything in, but that strangely made us feel less full eating everything else. But teen school boys would eat and eat and just not get fat. I never understood how some people gained so much weight till im like over 40 and see childrens tiny packet portions of sounds healthy fruits with like 60% veg plants filler for everything advertising calorie controlled diet for primary school children or lunch box sized? wouldnt the children be eating their school books when they get home and dont find food or seasonings or sauces in the cupboards by the end of the week?

I think young people maybe arent picky eaters and dark nabe might be more common in school children with easy rice cooker and microwave or air fryer quick cooking they might be doing more meals than the eternal cheese toasties that we crammed more and more stuff inside of till they were super gross and the largest oversized 4 sandwhich sized presses couldnt fit them in and handles break squeezing it down. Then when i see some giant fat children i wonder what they managed to fit inside their sandwhich press or rice cooker nabe pots? and if they found any awesome secret ingredients?",0,1752194041.0,Cooking,7,0.27,False

Beginnings of a **FAQ** about meetups:

* [rules for publicizing a meetup on reddit platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/wiki/index/calendar/disclaimer)
* [what happens at these meetups?](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/a3um4s/weekend_meetup_thread/ebab1pj/)
* [/u/solidified50 gave some general advice for starting a meetup and keeping it going.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/aa5khh/weekend_meetup_thread/ed4cu3m/)
* Meetups should be (mostly) free. Ordering coffee, similar minimum items from a menu excepted, but events that charge formal admission or an entry fee cannot be publicized here.
* Some meetups use a sign to give attendees an easy way to see the group and know which to join without too much embarrassment, etc.",3,1752193785.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

I went to Mormon church more than any other church growing up, even episcopal which I was brought up in before both my parents lost their faith. 

One of the girls I was best friends with was like a sister and her mom sold this stuff called choffey, she described it as an alternative to coffee, I think it was ground up cocoa beans. My mom didn’t want me drinking it or want to buy any and I never knew why until recently when I thought back on it and realized it might have been an MLM!! 

Honestly, this made me so sad because I loved this family and they were absolutely nothing but kind and generous to me, always inviting me over and feeding me and inviting me to family focused events. It was deeper than just conversion, it truly was. They were like family to me. So to know that the mom was being taken advantage of like this is so devastating to me. 

Anyone remember this product? I’d like to take a trip down memory lane but it’s hard to find anything about it…thanks :) ",2,1752193758.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

Like, if someone’s annoyed with me or giving me attitude, I’ll clock it almost immediately. I might not always know why, but I can definitely feel it.

So this situation’s been bugging me for a bit. I’ve got this really close friend we’ve known each other for a while and I would probably regard her as one of my closest friends , and we’ve had our ups and downs before, but we’ve always managed to talk it out. Nothing has ever festered between us for too long.

About two weeks ago, we went out for coffee just the two of us. Everything felt normal. We chatted, caught up, nothing seemed off. No awkwardness, no tension, just a chill catch-up. Then last Sunday, I hosted a small gathering like 7 people total including me — and she came along. I was doing my usual host thing, talking to everyone, checking in, keeping the vibes up. But something about her energy toward me felt… weird.

When I say weird, I mean cold. Barely made eye contact with me, hardly said more than a couple of words. She wasn’t being rude or dramatic — just distant, like she didn’t want to engage at all. I brushed it off at first, figured maybe she was tired or just in a weird mood. Whatever.

Fast forward to this past Tuesday — it was a mutual friend’s birthday dinner. There were maybe 10 of us, all sitting down at a long table. When I arrived, there was an empty seat next to her, so I thought, “Cool, maybe we can finally talk or catch up a bit.” Nope. She barely acknowledged me the whole evening. She was chatting away to the person on her other side, laughing, looking totally engaged… just not with me. It was honestly kind of awkward and lowkey embarrassing.

So now I’m sitting here wondering what the hell is going on. Like, did I say something? Do something? Or is she just quietly deciding to cut me off? We’ve always been honest with each other in the past when things got tense, so I don’t get why she’d suddenly ghost me emotionally like this. I want to just message her and be like:

“Hey, I’ve been picking up on some weird energy lately and just wanted to check in. Is everything okay between us? If I’ve done something to upset you, I’d rather talk about it than sit in silence.”

But I don’t want to come off as overly dramatic or confrontational if it’s nothing. I also don’t want to keep pretending everything’s fine if it’s very much not.

We went to the beach for a week with our two young kids and all shared a house. They live a few hours from us so we've never really spent more than a day together. Needless to say, I was expecting them to help with the kids who they never see and were talking about being with for months in advance. My MIL did \*nothing\* the entire week. 

At one point, I was at the stove making scrambled eggs for my toddler who was having a level 10 meltdown in my arms. (My husband had gone to get us coffee.) She was SCROLLING FACEBOOK on the porch. My FIL was asleep. I confronted her later that day and told her I was frustrated and she said, ""Just tell me next time, and I'll go wake up FIL and ask him to help!"" Tell you? Can you not put Facebook down for 5 minutes and hold the grandson you never see? Or stir some f-ing eggs?

Day after day, she sat on the sofa and scrolled, as we were all running around (FIL included) and then, after we'd made lunch, put diaper bags and beach bags together, gotten kids dressed and sunscreened, thrown in a load of laundry, and put everything away in the kitchen, she'd look up and say, ""Can I do anything?"" knowing damn well there's nothing left to do. 

I was in a pretty shitty mood most of the time and probably not as kind as I should've been due to increasing frustration and exhaustion, but I did make an effort to connect with her at the pool and beach. We've never had that long to chat before. ""Are you reading anything good?"" ""I don't read."" ""Do you like to play card games or board games?"" ""Not really. I've played Spades some."" ""I don't enjoy puzzles, they bore me."" So... you live in a small town, you don't have friends, and apparently don't have hobbies besides Facebook. She is a red-down-the-ballot voter despite not following politics whatsoever (big eyeroll there), so clearly can't engage in any political discussions. What are we supposed to talk about?! I mean, hell, I mentioned Elon Musk a year or so ago and she had never even heard of him...

I'm disappointed. I really thought we could have a good relationship, but I refuse to travel with someone who expects to be waited on hand and foot and gets the cute social media photos while I do twice as much work as I would at home.

1lwsmib,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1lwsmib/stardust_to_ashes/,stardust to ashes,"My mother fell critically ill and was rushed to the hospital. Desperate, I knelt before my fiancé—the department's chief surgeon—and begged him to take charge of her operation.
But outside the ICU, he was carefully tending to a scraped knee. Lucy Wendell's scraped knee, to be exact.
Just as I was drowning in hopelessness, Cameron Mitchell—the hospital director and my childhood friend—pushed open the operating room doors and handed me a marriage proposal.
""Marry me, and I'll personally perform your mother's surgery.""
With trembling hands, I signed my name, clinging to the last shred of hope that she could be saved.
But she never made it through that stormy night.
Cameron handled all the funeral arrangements himself, and our wedding proceeded as scheduled.
Seven years later, in the hushed silence of the hospital archives, I overheard Cameron speaking with the deputy director.
""Cameron, why did you transfer your mother-in-law's organ to Lucy's mother during that surgery? Weren't you afraid of getting caught?""
""I owed Lucy,"" he replied. ""If I hadn't hesitated back then, Lucy never would've chosen medical aid work in Africa… and her mother wouldn't have fallen ill from the grief.""
Chapter 1
""All these years, I stayed by Marianne's side… only to atone for my sins.""
Cameron Mitchell's voice was as warm and gentle as ever, yet his words sent a chill through my entire body.
So what I'd mistaken for redemption… was nothing but charity.
In his heart, there had only ever been one woman—Lucy Wendell.
Fine. I would step aside and give them my blessing.
…
The archive room door stood slightly ajar. Cameron's voice drifted out, thick with remorse.
""I had no choice. I already hurt Lucy once—I couldn't let anything happen to her mother, too. As for Marianne… I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to her.""
The deputy director's voice dropped, but the anger beneath was unmistakable.
""But that surgery seven years ago—you could've saved them both! You ripped out Marianne's mother's kidney just to give it to Lucy's mom! If this gets out, you won't just lose your license—you'll go to prison! All for a woman who never loved you back. Was it worth it?""
Not even a second of hesitation.
Cameron's reply struck like lightning through my chest. ""Worth it.""
His words exploded in my skull, leaving a deafening roar in their wake.
""Then keep this buried. Don't let her find out. Don't forget—Marianne's been a journalist for years. You ruined yourself over Lucy… but have you ever stopped to think? You destroyed Marianne, too.""
""Let her find out if she wants. If it comes to that, I'll take the fall. At least I've saved enough to ensure she'll live a rich life.""
His tone was disturbingly calm, as if discussing the forecast.
""Cameron, I just don't get you. Whatever—there's no reasoning with you…""
Their voices faded.
Footsteps approached—the sharp click of leather shoes against tile.
Panicked, I turned to leave—but my skirt snagged on the shelf.
The scalding coffee in my hand sloshed over my white dress, seeping through the fabric and burning my skin.
The pain was sharp, but it was nothing compared to the raw, jagged hole splitting open in my chest.
So this was my marriage. Built on lies and sacrifice.
My mother hadn't died from some tragic complication. She'd been murdered—sacrificed for my husband's precious first love.
Seven years ago, my ex-fiancé Nicholas Martin's betrayal made me the laughingstock of the city.
And Cameron's proposal? It had been bought with my mother's life.
Every tender word, every gentle touch—none of it had been love. Just guilt. Atonement.
Now, it all made sense.
Why the hospital's best ward was always reserved for Lucy's charity cases. Why he personally escorted her whenever she visited. Even our wedding rings were custom-designed in her favorite style.
I was the fool. Parading around in this hollow marriage, flaunting a love that was never real. Just another one of Cameron's pity projects.
Did Lucy laugh every time she saw me?
Did she struggle to keep a straight face, watching me play the oblivious clown?
Chapter 2
The archive room door clicked shut behind me. The deputy director's footsteps dissolved into the hospital's white noise.
At the hallway's end, Cameron stood watching me with that familiar, indulgent gaze—the one that used to make my heart flutter.
""What are you doing here?"" His brow furrowed as he noticed my stained dress. ""And why are you all wet?""
I steadied my voice. ""Just spilled my coffee. I was heading to change.""
His fingers brushed the damp fabric. ""You've burned yourself."" A sigh. ""My clumsy girl. When you hurt, I hurt too.""
Then he kissed me.
The scent of alcohol clung to his breath. Just like every kiss before—lingering, tender, affectionate. But this time, I couldn't breathe.
Love could be faked. Tenderness and concern could be performed—even for someone you didn't love—if it meant protecting the one you truly did.
Tears welled in my eyes. I turned my head away, and they spilled silently down my cheeks.
I followed him to his private lounge. Under the influence of alcohol, he quickly fell asleep.
I sat by the bed, my hands trembling as I unlocked his phone.
Seven years of marriage, and this was the first time I'd ever looked through it.
The password was a string of numbers—Lucy's birthday.
The phone displayed years' worth of partnership documents from the medical group. At a glance, they seemed routine. But a closer look revealed the truth: every single contract was tied to Lucy's charity foundation.
He had sacrificed far more profitable ventures to support her medical aid projects.
Every initiative was based in a small African town, where she had once lived.
Even the project funding amounts were veiled tributes:
Her birthday.
The day she performed her first surgery.
The date she founded her clinic in Africa.
My fingers trembled as I opened his private photo album.
There were a thousand photos, all of Lucy.
Snapshots of her at medical conferences. Candids from hospital rounds. Pictures from charity galas she attended with Nicholas.
In each one, Nicholas's figure had been carefully cropped out, leaving only her smiling presence.
Beyond that were countless procurement orders for medical equipment and supplies.
The latest machines. The rarest medications. All sent to her clinic under the guise of humanitarian aid.
His love for her was hidden in every detail.
And as I stared at it all, a tightness wrapped around my chest.
It was all a lie. Everything I'd believed—all of it—had been a carefully crafted illusion. Cameron's love had never belonged to me.
I let out a bitter laugh and powered off his phone.
Then I booked a one-way ticket to Northern Europe—three days from now.
I also filled out an application to cancel my legal identification records.
Seven years of marriage. If I was going to end it, I'd end it clean.
When it was all done, I felt a weight lift from my chest.
But just then, my phone buzzed with a notification.
A moment later, Cameron's voice echoed from behind me.
""Marianne, what are you canceling? The system just sent me a security alert.""
Suppressing the panic clawing at my chest, I forced a smile. ""My passport expired. I'm just renewing it. Aren't you heading abroad soon for that medical conference? You have meetings tomorrow, right? You should get some rest.""
He wrapped an arm around my waist, his voice muffled against my shoulder.
""You even remember my schedule… You really are the most thoughtful wife.""
Then he turned over and mumbled, ""Tomorrow night, I'll take you somewhere special. I have a surprise for you.""
""All right,"" I said softly. ""I can't wait.""
We didn't get home until late that night.
The next morning, his personal assistant arrived, pushing in a breakfast cart.
Every morning, the head chef would prepare meals tailored to my preferences.
I used to think it was the sweetest gesture. But now… I saw it for what it was. A performance.
If he truly cared, how was it that not once—not even once—did he ever cook me even the simplest bowl of anything himself?
Chapter 3
Cameron had gone to extraordinary lengths to keep me from interfering with Lucy's medical aid work.
The delicate breakfast spread before me turned my stomach. Without touching a bite, I pushed the tray aside and walked out.
The law office was nearly empty. Within minutes, I held two copies of our divorce agreement.
At the medical group's headquarters, nurses' whispers followed me:
""Isn't that Dr. Mitchell's wife? That Van Cleef & Arpels necklace—he had it custom-made in Paris! I could never afford that in three lifetimes!""
""Dr. Mitchell's so successful, yet completely devoted to her. A real Prince Charming...""
On the top floor, I paused outside the office door. Cameron's gentle voice carried through. ""How has he been treating you?""
""Wonderfully,"" Lucy replied. ""Just a few days ago, he agreed to donate the latest medical equipment to the African clinic. We've been married seven years, and he's still so thoughtful…""
His voice dropped noticeably. ""That's good… I've always worried about you.""
""You've just donated even more equipment to the clinic,"" she said with a soft laugh. ""If Marianne finds out, she won't be pleased.""
Lucy was always so sweet, so understanding. But if she truly cared about my feelings, why bring me up at all? Especially when she'd already taken everything from me.
Seven years ago in that hospital room, she'd declared without shame that Nicholas never loved me—that his heart had always been hers. The shock sent my mother into relapse, necessitating emergency surgery that night.
A flurry of footsteps jolted me from the memory.
Cameron's assistant brushed past me and pushed open the door to the meeting room.
Cameron's gaze shot toward me, a flicker of panic flashing in his eyes.
""Marianne? What are you doing here? We're just discussing the aid program for the African clinic. Lucy is the project lead…""
""Long time no see, Marianne,"" Lucy said as she stood with practiced grace. The embroidery on her new-season dress shimmered in the sunlight.
It was the same dress I'd once asked Cameron to buy for me.
And yet, there it was—on her.
I gave a polite nod. ""I was just passing by and thought I'd say hello. Since you're busy with work, I won't keep you.""
Cameron rushed out after me, words tumbling over each other in a flurry of explanations.
There was panic in his voice, anxiety in his eyes.
But I felt only exhaustion.
He'd gone to such lengths just to stay close to Lucy. And now, with his dream girl standing right there, he still had the audacity to play the part of a devoted husband?
""It's fine. Go back to work,"" I said with a smile. ""I didn't mean anything by it. I'll just wait for you at home.""
He visibly relaxed. After murmuring a few perfunctory reassurances, he turned and hurried back into the office.
Watching his retreating figure, I couldn't help but recall how attentive he used to be when we first got together.
Back then, he would panic over the smallest things that affected me. He told me I could live freely, however I pleased.
And like a fool, I believed him. So I gave up a promotion I'd worked years for—earned from the front lines as a journalist.
Meanwhile, Lucy now held the title of Asia Director for an international medical aid organization.
Time had passed, and the gap between us had become an unbridgeable chasm.
Was this your plan, Cameron? To ensure I'd never catch up, never measure up to your flawless first love?
Back home, I gathered every luxury item he'd ever given me over the past seven years.
One by one, I packed them into cardboard boxes. Then I shipped them all to a luxury resale boutique.
Love, I could live without. But not money.
I would use this money to help people who truly needed it.
As I watched the packages being loaded onto the courier truck, I finally turned away.
And then, a voice cut through the silence behind me.
""All these years, and you're still so useless. You couldn't even save your mother, and now your husband doesn't even respect you.""
Chapter 4
""Marianne, you're a joke!"" Lucy spat.
So… she had known the truth all along?
Seven years of buried rage erupted all at once. I raised my hand and slapped her hard across the face.
Lucy staggered backward with dramatic flair, tumbling straight into the fountain behind her.
Before I could react, Cameron shoved me aside and rushed to pull her out of the water.
His eyes turned to me, cold and sharp as ice. ""Marianne, have you lost your mind? Lucy came to apologize! How could you lay a hand on her?!""
I let out a bitter laugh. ""She mentioned my mother, Cameron. Don't you think it's time we finally settled this?""
His pupils contracted sharply. ""Your mom passed away due to a surgical error. What does that have to do with Lucy?! Apologize to her. Right now!""
But Lucy clutched at his sleeve, her voice delicate and filled with false humility.
""It's fine… it was my fault. We both owe Marianne an apology. Maybe this is just my punishment. If she hates me this much, it's best if we stop seeing each other. I don't want to be the reason you two fight.""
I watched them walk away, their silhouettes growing smaller as my fingernails dug deep into my palms.
An hour later, Cameron sent me a message:
[Lucy is the lead on our biggest aid project. What you did today could hurt the hospital's reputation. The apology was just for appearances—don't take it personally. I'll be home once I wrap things up. Remember I said I had a surprise for you? Wait for me.]
Every word was laced with his usual gentle charm.
But this entire performance hadn't been for Lucy. It had been for me—to keep me quiet, to keep me blind.
I clutched the divorce papers and waited from late at night until dawn.
He never came home.
But the internet exploded.
#MedicalGroupCEOGoesAllOutForHisMuse shot straight to the top of trending topics.
Despite Lucy only suffering minor scrapes, he had mobilized the hospital's top experts and spared no expense.
Photos showed him gently supporting her during a check-up, his gaze full of tenderness.
The entire medical center had stayed lit through the night—all for one woman's superficial injury.
I looked at the bruises on my wrist—left from when Cameron had yanked me so hard the day before—and felt no more hesitation.
I signed the divorce papers and packed my bags.
Then I went straight to the hospital where my mother had undergone her final surgery.
I retrieved a copy of the organ donation consent form from seven years ago.
At the bottom, glaring back at me was my signature.
But I hadn't signed it.
He had forged it, mimicking my handwriting perfectly.
I made copies of the document and mailed them directly to the hospital.
By the time I boarded my flight, Cameron should have received them.
Just as the boarding announcement rang out, my phone began to buzz.
[Marianne, I asked Brendan to drop off your gift. Why weren't you home?]
[Are you still mad at me?]
[Come on, don't be like this. I'll make it up to you when I get back.]
I stared at the messages on the screen, then tapped into a livestream pushed to my feed.
In the livestream, Cameron was accompanying Lucy as she picked out a dress for a charity gala.
His eyes followed her every move.
I didn't reply. Instead, I quietly deleted every trace of him from my contacts.
One final buzz came through.
It was a confirmation text. [Your ID cancellation was successful.]
Suddenly, chaos broke into the livestream.
Cameron's assistant, Brendan Cole, burst into the frame, gasping for breath, his face pale as ash. He held a document tightly in his hands as he ran up to Cameron.
""Dr. Mitchell! Marianne found out the truth about the surgery from seven years ago. We can't reach her anymore!""
For the first time, cracks split the polished façade on Cameron's face.
He stood frozen, as if someone had just told him a joke too absurd to comprehend.

He's killing himself and wildlife.

---------------

Today, while heading in to the city for some breakfast (one of the many delights of retirement), I was unfortunately stuck behind a City of Albany Vehicle. At the light before the Krumkill Rd on ramp to 85, a Black Jeep--license BA217-something--wafted a large puff of smoke out of the driver's window. With disgust, I had to roll up my window and turn the recirc on. With horror, I watched helplessly as I bore witness to a heinous act of littering the suspect cigarette butt.

This is a PSA:
Cigarette butts are plastic. They are not biodegradable. The residual nicotine kills plants on the side of the road, and chokes out vultures and gulls when they inevitably ingest them--bioaccumulating whatever plastic goo comes with it. They eventuly in our waterways, making it more difficult to filter our drinking water, and poisoning out aquatic life. 

Continuing to the city, I passed the offending driver who was now dangerously close to driving off the road just before the under construction bridge with the lane change--past Everett Rd. I figured I didn't want to be anywhere near someone texting and driving. Instead, I witnessed a man possibly in their 60s, but perhaps the cigarettes were simply aging them young, hammering an extra large beverage in a disposal Stewart's cup (the kind for hot coffee). His glasses reminded me of a pair I wore as a child in the late 60s. By the time he passed me again, smoke was billowing out of the car once more. I can only imagine the volume of butts this City Employee is disposing of improperly, and how much time other civil servants are spending cleaning up his mess.

I cannot fathom smoking cigarettes, but I know some folks choose to. I cannot fathom chain smoking in a City Owned car while speeding through a work zone, but I know it's easy to get wrapped up in the morning commute. 

I cannot minimize littering.

Anyway, this was my story from this morning. Please don't litter, be kind to your lungs, and to City owned Property.

I tried looking for subreddits that could be right for this topic, but I couldn’t find any..(please suggest if you know any, because I don’t use reddit that often.) It started yesterday at about 2:40 am when me and my partner started smelling a burnt coffee smell practically at the same time and in the matter of seconds we both got dizzy and in a state of confusion and fear. At the time what we did was get our dog and go as fast outside as we could and contacted emergency services. Medics and firefighters arrived at our location neither of the professionals understood us or felt the same sensations as we did. My partner was going with them and also felt nothing anymore it was all in a matter of seconds for us. In the end they did nothing and told us to calm down, but when we returned home after about an hour we felt it again also suddenly looking at each other confused and worried like before. Today at about 1:10 am same thing we went outside again and tried waiting it out, but didn’t call anyone. The symptoms and smells all are the same, I feel paranoid, confused and very dizzy. Google suggested that it could be gas leaks, mold or someone using drugs nearby. The thing is is that we don’t have any gas appliances and I checked for mold, but either way I don’t think mold smells like this. My boyfriend’s brother is a police officer yesterday morning he also suspected drug activity, because of the part of town where we live in, which is known for dangerous and illegal activities. I haven’t asked any neighbours yet if they experienced the same thing, honestly I’m a bit scared because of the dismissive acts of emergency service providers. They all looked at us like we were crazy. Tomorrow I’m planning on making some kind of board with the question and leaving it on the first floor in hopes that someone might also have this issue.

He said it’s likely just irritation from my previous UTI (though I don’t understand how the irritation started a week after I finished a course of antibiotics).

There’s a guy (60-70ish) who works on tills at this store. Initially he was friendly but a bit touchy, for example, hands on shoulders, back, lower back etc. Like if he needed past me on the kiosk he’d put a hand on me. I’ve noticed this happening with the other young girls that work there as it’s a student dominated staff, and a lot of the till workers are young girls. I also know that he has asked 2 young girls (late teens or early twenties) “out for coffee to get to know them better”. The girls haven’t reported it, and when they say no, he stops. Recently he’s been talking to me more, asking when I’m in more and saying “we’ll catch up another time” when his shift ends. 

Today I sliced my finger open and went behind the kiosk to get a plaster and ended up staying there for a while waiting for the bleeding to stop. He came over because it was quiet and asked what happened. Whilst this is happening my shift leader is on the other side of the kiosk right infront of me, talking to a customer. He asked if there was anything he could do to help and I said no. Then he walked away, came back a minute later and offered to kiss it better. When I didn’t laugh, he burst out laughing and turned to leave. My shift leader either didn’t hear or didn’t care.

I’m not sure about reported him because the store has quite a close knit staff, he’s been there for years. It’s important to mention that this man is absolutely useless at his job, doesn’t know how to do any returns or refunds, struggles with the lottery machine and asks a shift leader to help with every customer that needs something. I don’t think he’s an evil predator intentionally trying to get young girls to go out with him. Chances are he’s just lonely, but there’s plenty of age appropriate people he can make friends with, and he’s going for teenage girls he works with, that can’t get away from him on tills.

TL;DR ordered an air rush jump cue online directly from predator. The shaft was defective, and now I am going through the worst online purchase experience of my life.

June 30th. Having my morning coffee when I received an email from predator. Look at that the new Air Rush Jump Cue Night Claw editions just came out. I just got a work bonus this month and decide I'm going to spoil myself. I was lucky(or so I thought) enough to buy one before they sold out in about an hour. 



When paying online they had multiple shipment options, only the cheapest option stated they would not send any tracking information. I decided paying extra to receive tracking information was worth it so I went with a more expensive option. Well I received an order confirmation email, and that was the last I heard from them. I’m glad I spent that extra money for tracking that I never received.



July 8th. I still haven't received a receipt, or any information about my order being shipped. Well it was a new drop and they were having a 4th of July sale so they must be busy. I’ll give them a call tomorrow to see what’s up.



Later that day I heard a knock at the door. What do you know it’s the UPS man with a package. He kindly tells me I have to pay the import fees online and all I need is the tracking number. Sure thing, no problem I thought.



I open up my package and the cue is honestly sick looking, and I’m overjoyed. This feeling will be short lived though.



Hop on the UPS website to pay the import fees and what do you know I need an account number that I don’t have since the invoice says right on it that the driver is supposed to receive payment. Well guess I’ll call support this should be fun. After talking with support and receiving an account number that didn’t work they inform me the only possible way to make the payment is by giving them my full credit card details over the phone. This option is not ideal but after talking to 3 support agents, and being on hold for 2 hours I’m defeated and agree.



Finally it’s time to test out this cue. I chalk it up, set up some jump shots and get to it. Immediately I hear a strange sound. Upon further investigation I come to the realization that something is broken inside the shaft by the joint, and there is a very audible rattling noise that can be heard.



This is my worst case scenario, a defective product. I begin to dread the process that lies ahead of me but life has responsibilities, and this will be a problem for future me.



July 10th. I worked late the night before so I could have today off to try and deal with the situation, since free time during the week is, as many people know, a luxury.

I call predator support and deal with a very helpful women who instructs me on what to do, and provides me with a customer service email. I’d like to thank this person for being helpful, and the only part of this experience that was not akin to pulling teeth with a pair of pliers.



I take the email I was provided and explain my issue in detail, with an attached video of the shaft rattle. Bill replies within about 20 minutes, and offers me the helpful suggestion of tightening the cue weight bolts. I again explain my issue, and inform Bill that as far as I’m aware cue shafts have no weight bolts. I’m no expert so I kindly ask him to provide me with any information he has for me to accomplish this. The reply I receive is copy and pasted with their warranty claim info and a new link to an online support ticket. I have more questions that I ask but alas Bill is never to be heard from again. So I fill out my support ticket, and send it off.



I received a new email from Ted with a copy and pasted reply. The email informs me they need to see the shaft to determine if it has a defect or if I’m stupid. It states all returns must be approved, and the email provides a link to fill out an online support ticket that I just filled out to get to this email. It is also brought to my attention that I must provide a copy of the original receipt which was never sent to me. And because I’m Canadian I have the honor of paying to ship the defective shaft back to them which they may, or may not replace. Of course I have more questions that I ask but alas Ted is also never to be heard from again.



So after wasting half of my day, getting no answers and being right back where I started, the ordeal will have to continue another day. 



I suppose the next day I have free time I’ll waste it calling support again so I can go through this loop over, and over, and over again until I am defeated.

I went to college for a year after high school but ended up dropping out because i didnt know what i wanted to major in and felt like it was a waste of time because i didnt actually know what i wanted to pursue. I have been working different jobs since then. To give more insight I really despise corporate environments , the performance feels so draining. I mostly have worked warehouse jobs. I had a job that i really loved at thredup which is an online resale platform.The commute was short and the was better than any job i previously had. The shifts were 10 hours but i didnt mind it because it felt fun for me . After a year of working mostly 50 hours a week i begun to get a little burnt out. There was a position doing authentication where i would be able to sit down ( the other roles were very manual) that i was really interested in. I always exceeded my workload metrics and worked hard. I began to feel frustrated when new hires were able to fill the role i wanted even though i was told that i had to wait a year before i could apply. This frustration and burn out caused me to use my phone a couple times in the warehouse which was a big no no for the company. If i would have just taken a couple days off to relax i would have been able to come back and work as hard as i normally did. I got written up and let go because i was caught on my phone. Loosing my job has been such a painful lesson that Im still trying to cope with.Its been three years since and ive reached out multiple times and even sent an apology with pastries to the headquarters in california. I know that may seem excessive but this job really meant a lot to me , i felt like i was making a difference in the world and having fun while doing it. I have struggled keeping employment since. I have tried many things like learning to run embroidery machines and make coffee. eventually I always grow sick of the repetitive nature. I have tried to look into going back to school but still im not interested in any degrees that will land me in an office. Im really passionate about sustainable fashion but i have found it not to be a lucrative and oversaturated to do resell on platforms like depop and poshmark. I would spend hours sourcing, cleaning, repairing, and posting and no one ever wants to be pay what im asking even though i always price things fairly. I just dont know what to do , I know it may be a shot in the dark to ask strangers on here who dont actually know me but im desperate for some direction. Thank you for your time.

1lwrzo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1lwrzo0/our_story/,Our Story,"I’m a 40 year old SAHM from Florida. I’ve been happily married for 18 years. My husband started waking up slowly over the course of 3 years. Even as an elder, he was secretly reading and watching apostate material. He rationalized a lot of the things he’d read, always reminding himself that apostates are mentally diseased and can’t be trusted. He wanted to tell me but loved me too much to risk losing me so he suffered in silence just hoping I’d wake up one day. And I did. I woke up from the cult in one gut-punch of a moment—when they turned on us after our foster daughter left. She got “in trouble” with a boy in our hall but then left our home before she could be “disciplined by the Elders, she had just been baptized at our last assembly.” In her absence, they came after my husband. He sat in a room with his “friends” and fellow elders—including his own father, who was too much of a coward to defend him—men with no kids, window washers and toy train salesmen, who berated him for three hours about being a permissive, bad parent. He was removed as an elder and Watchtower study overseer for refusing to bow to their will or admit to something he didn’t do. They dismissed him without even a prayer—like he’d been disfellowshipped. I had pioneered for 20 years. We weren’t on the fringe—we were the faithful ones. Active in the congregation, our kids were on the school, answering at every meeting, “exemplary” 🙄. We made the memorial bread every year for several surrounding congregations. Just 6 months before we left my husband conducted the WT at the circuit assembly and our entire family gave comments on the platform. He was also the Sound Overseer at the Circuit Assembly and Attendant Overseer at the Convention in charge of 250 brothers. He even got to hang out in the secret Chairman’s office backstage where all the big wigs hung out, who also all happened to be the richest brothers. They had a huge room with snacks, coffee, desserts, and a comfy seating area. The wives of the Department heads rotate working to serve the brothers and I was asked to help, what an honor. They even requested that I make one of my famous charcuterie boards to bring because they were “impressive.” We pioneered together and attended Pioneer Servce School, my third time going. My husband and I organized and fed our semiannual Congregation cleanup where we cooked for and fed 250-300 people. Our years of RBC food service helped with that. I was put in charge of the Makeup Department at the Assembly where I organized 4 other sisters to rotate putting makeup on brothers backstage before they go on to give their part. Gotta look good for that Jumbotron! We were accepted as Delegates to the International Convention in Ecuador and toured and stayed in the same hotel as Br. Cook from the Governing Body, but he was in the penthouse. On our dime. Yours and mine. We spent a lot of time on Bethel property, stayed in the Bossert & other residence buildings when friends gifted us their “room credits” for friends and family to be guests there. We toured and stayed at Walkill and we even got to sleep over at Warwick with our friends before it even officially opened. We got a full backstage tour of Warwick, Tuxedo, the JW Broadcast set, and even got to see the beautiful mountain cottages that had been purchased for visiting Family members of the Governing Body (with “dedicated funds” of course). We even got to hang out in the enormous Billiards room at Warwick, adorned with pool tables, ping pong tables, and large expensive leather chairs. My friends asked me not to share any photos of that particular room on social media. and were told funny stories about how expensive the heated sidewalks were that they put in around the entire property. e had grown up around tons of Bethelites so we were “connected”. We dined with Anthony Morris at Bethel and even saw his residence, he lived right next door to his son and his wife who also served at Bethel. Our friends told us that Anthony could often be found in a T-shirt and basketball shorts shopping in the commissary for a midnight snack. We attended 1 Gilead Graduation, 2 SKE Graduations, and an Annual Meeting at the beautiful Stanley Assembly hall. One CO couple who had previously served our congregation became very close friends of ours. Every time they came to visit they would stay in our home. I’m a wonderful hostess, they had a lovely comfortable guest room, Cush bathrobes in their private bathroom, and every meal and alcoholic beverage prepared and served to them like kings. They loved expensive restaurant experiences like we did (of course they did, they were never paying) so one year we scored a reservation at the coveted Chef’s table in Victoria & Albert’s, a Michelin Star restaurant inside of Disney’s Grand Floridian Hotel. It was a 13 course meal with wine pairings and upgrades to Waygu beef. There were 6 of us. We and the other couple agreed to split the bill and we’d pay for one, they’d pay for the other. Our bill was over $1500 not including tip. This was more than our mortgage payment. I was terrified the entire time the waiter was running our card because I wasn’t sure if it would even clear. But what a PRIVILEGE to get to give these people, who were cool people but are no better than us, a free dinner! The brainwashing is insane. Because of the unique story of adopting our sons from foster care and our reliance on Jehovah through it all, we were even selected to be interviewed by the Editorial department at Bethel to share our story. We signed a model release and spent hours filming the interview on Zoom and answering questions. The brother (a wannabe journalist) then sent us the accompanying article he’d written and said it was in Bethel’s hands now, so who knew when it would show up. Please know none of that was to brag, it was honestly sickening even typing it all out. But it shows just how deep “in” we truly were. Yet still, we were tossed aside like trash. The second he was removed, we became pariahs. I had never seen friends turn on me this way, I’d never been “in trouble”. It was so odd, so hurtful. Our foster daughter leaving was unexpected, she was with us over 2 years and had gotten baptized, the rest is her story to tell. But we thought we were adopting her, walking her down the aisle, being grandparents to her children, and suddenly she was just gone. It was like a death. And nobody was there. We weren’t reproved, weren’t different people, but there was a shift. Then slowly, privileges started slowly being removed. I was told I was no longer needed on the makeup department at the Assembly because of my “in person meeting attendance. I did a lot of the meetings on Zoom rather than the Kingdom Hall because I had SEVEN CHILDREN. Including an underweight newborn who was dropped off at 17 days old in need of a home. But I was on every single one. I raised my digital hand and unmuted and commented and so did the 5 of my 7 children who could speak. My husband couldn’t help me of course, because he was at the Hall doing the Watchtower. Our teenager usually went with him as well because she wanted to see her friends and it was really the only social interaction she got because we were weird Christian homeschoolers. Ugh. Then the brothers started making excuses as to why they weren’t using Joey for anything, even carrying a microphone. Legitimate lies were told to us and about us by elders. “They can lie?” I asked. In my brainwashed naivety I truly thought these men were good honest men, like my husband and Father, and that they were basically infallible. I had watched Leah Remini’s Scientology show, fascinated and seeing so many comparisons but it never registering. But in Season 3, she did one episode on the Witnesses because people were writing in and saying, “You think Scientology is bad?! You should see the Jehovah’s Witnesses! One night, I said to my husband, “Wanna watch the JW episode of the Scientology show?” He quickly agreed, internally freaking out knowing this could be it, the moment I wake up. But even he wasn’t full awake yet. We watched the hour long episode. I sat, wide eyed, with my mouth agape in absolute shock. I turned to him and said, “Oh my god, are we in a cult?!” He silently nodded and then slowly said, “I think so.” I jumped up on my knees and yelled, “We have to get out! We didn’t get much sleep that night as we went down the apostate wormhole, eating it all up like candy. The next day, I changed my phone number. And I didn’t give it out to anybody. Didn’t say goodbye to anyone but my parents. Who didn’t listen and don’t speak to me even though they live within walking distance of their children and grandchildren. Because I knew that all of that love was conditional. I knew the emotional toll it would take on me to have to have the same conversation over and over, being berated or love bombed, interrogated and coerced. So I just vanished. And suddenly, I wasn’t confused anymore. Wasn’t Discouraged. I was awake. And once you see it, you can’t unsee it. I had no idea about any of it—not the CSA coverups, the lies, so many lies, and not the secret real estate companies. We left the next day and never looked back. People we loved ghosted us overnight. We lost everyone—including our parents and entire JW family. We’re not disfellowshipped, but the shunning is real. My husband was at the gym yesterday, his brother walked in, saw him, and literally ran out the door. His brother who, went to jail for 2 years being caught in a child predator sting operation he thought he was talking to an 11 year old child but it was an adult luring him to a house and telling him to buy condoms first so it could be used as evidence. He was disfellowshipped (which they tried to appeal because he had been conveniently diagnosed as Bipolar and addicted to pornography-he served at Bethel for a year as a young man and was sent home because he was caught looking at pornography) and sentenced to 2 years in prison. He was REINSTATED IN PRISON, I’m still so confused how that happens, and came home exonerated spiritually with nobody really knowing the full story and Witnesses clamoring to give him a job at their businesses because he’s a Felon who can’t even work near a school. He then reveals to his family that the reason he had this manic episode was because he was trying to SAVE the child. This was because he was in a euphoric spiritual state because he was receiving his heavenly calling. That’s right everyone, he’s anointed!!!! The pedophile is a PARTAKER, like he drinks the wine and thinks God chose him to rule over us all in heaven when he dies. Anyway, he was LISTENING on his parents security camera when my husband told his mom & dad we were leaving.

How tf did you get the idea it is just black coffee? And simultaneously you make fun of Americans for constantly needing cream and sugar in their coffee, but your first idea of an americano is that it’s just black coffee? The audacity of someone not to research their coffee and then just bash a watered down espresso as “it’s just black coffee”. God man! The pretentious audacity of the British at its finest!

An americano is as follows

Caffè americano (Italian: [kafˈfɛ ameriˈkaːno]; Spanish: café americano; lit. 'American coffee'), also known as americano or American, is an espresso shot with hot water at a 1:3 to 1:4 ratio, resulting in a drink that retains the complex flavors of espresso, but in a lighter way.[1] Its strength varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added. The name of the drink may also be written with Italian spelling and diacritics as ""caffè americano"", or Spanish spelling and diacritics as ""café americano"".

Americano as a drink is mentioned in the short story by W. Somerset Maugham ""The Hairless Mexican"". It was first published on January 1, 1927. The story is set in Naples, Italy, during the First World War.[2] Americano means 'American' in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese.[3] Some assert the term entered the English from Italian in the 1970s.[4][5][6][7] Caffè americano specifically is Italian for ""American coffee"".[8] There is a popular belief that the name has its origins in World War II when American G.I.s in Italy diluted espresso with hot water to approximate the coffee to which they were accustomed.[9] However, the Oxford English Dictionary cites the term as a borrowing from Central American Spanish café americano, a derisive term for mild coffee, dating back to the middle of the 1950s. Its first use in English appears in Jamaican newspaper The Sunday Gleaner in 1964. The term caffè americano entered Italian later than the English or Spanish uses, perhaps as a borrowing from one of the two languages.[10]
In Italy, caffè americano may mean either espresso with hot water or long-filtered coffee, but the latter is more precisely called caffè all'americana (lit. 'American-style coffee').[11]
Following increased tensions in 2025 between Canada and the United States, many cafés in Canada have begun re-branding the americano as ""canadiano"" on their menus.[12][13]

The drink consists of a single shot of espresso mixed with added water. Typically about 120 millilitres (4 imp fl oz; 4 US fl oz) – 180 millilitres (6 imp fl oz; 6 US fl oz) of hot water mixed with the espresso.[14]
Long black is an Australasian drink similar to the americano (in contrast to short black for espresso), with an emphasis being placed on the order of preparation, adding water to the cup first before pouring one or two espresso on top.[15][16]
In the western U.S., Italiano sometimes refers to a short americano with equal amounts of espresso and water (lungo).


To not know what an americano is, and to then insinuate as if you know what it is, after an entire story about how you don’t know what it is, all to act like you know what it is. Disgusting! I spit at the! ",18,1752190613.0,pyrocynical,5,0.87,False

Earlier this month I posted something about a possible bust on [Spoorstraat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rentbusters/comments/1lpg4m6/amsterdam_huge_garden_but_they_max_out_at_15pts/) in Amsterdam. The property, offered by Hollandsche Makelaardij (HM), was asking 2500 euro for a 43sqm apartment with a large garden. According to the [ep-online.nl](http://ep-online.nl), the property has an Energy label B, issued June 25 2025. 

Estimating the rent price, I came to a value close to the Liberalization border: 187pt with a buffer due to the WOZ cap. This might mean the property is bustable down to 1180 euro per month, a potential saving of 1300 euro per month. 

Earlier today, someone claiming to be Tom from HM called me and requested that I take down the post. 'Tom' was unhappy that the post had resulted in ""5 poor people"" applying for the apartment, thinking they could get a rent reduction for it.



https://reddit.com/link/1lwrsu7/video/t53ockfjp4cf1/player

 He stated that the property was undergoing a renovation and would soon have an A+ energy label, in spite of the fact that the property was available for moving in immediately.





 Angry that I was providing ""Wrong information"" Tom proceeded to explain that I am giving people bad advice as anyone who moves into the apartment expecting a bust would get screwed once the new energy label gets registered and yet continued to ignore that the apartment was bustable under the current label and that it could be that he was blowing smoke up my ass to discourage me from warning the future tenant or worse, placing a rentbuster in there.

Here are the lyrics:

The day ended in “y,” so I asked “why not”
And that first one was smooth, so I thought I’d just have two
I put the third one down, threw four on the ground and I can’t have five if there's a six’er around
And the cold was familiar on my tongue

I took your picture off the wall, and threw it to the ground
The glassware laid silent hoping i’d pick the pieces up
Cause tonight, I’m drinking about you

Seven came quick, but it wasn't that late, 
so went to the fridge and had myself eight
Nine was was enough and ten felt better
But eleven or twelve couldn't keep us together

And the best years are long behind us
So tonight, I’m drinking about you

The alarm clock kept blaring, while coffee brewed in the pot
Cold shower in the morning, clean shirt or not
Car keys on the counter, blood shot in my eyes
8 hours of working, and 12 more on ice

And it’s only been a lifetime since you left me
But tonight i’m still drinking about you
Yeah tonight im still drinking about you

I’ve read a lot of posts and I know I’m starting off in a much worse situation than a lot of people here. My LDL was 229 and my HDL 33, which was shocking to me and it really drove me to prioritize my health. My doctor said he wants me to change my diet and exercise and come back for another blood test in four months before he moves to putting me on statins.

This was back in April and since then I have done a complete 180 with my diet. Whole grains, little to no sugar, lots of berries and vegetables, and lean proteins. Less than 12g of saturated fat per day.

I’m happy to report that I have lost 12 lbs and my resting heart rate has gone down 10 BPM! 

Here is an example of what I eat in a day:

Breakfast: 
Coffee with almond milk and sugar free syrup;
Dave’s killer 21 grains bread with almond butter, sliced strawberries and blueberries

Lunch:
Small brown rice bowl with black beans, zucchini, mushrooms, broccoli, grilled chicken, and lemon vinaigrette 

Dinner:
Chickpea pasta with Livwell vegan Alfredo sauce, roasted asparagus, and baked salmon - (these Livwell sauces are my holy grail! So delicious!)

It feels like someone cut an inch off my back hamstring muscle and also my calf, sewed me shut then said hey buddy good luck walking! Or looking up. Or coughing. Hey if you sneeze you’ll really regret it.

Anyway 35 female here. 12 years ago I slipped and fell at work on some coffee and landed off kilter on my right buttock and it’s been a stiff sore time ever since. 

Last month I coughed too hard while sick and the same area I hurt then had a red hot zing of pain. Now I wake up and can’t walk well on my right leg without what I can only describe as a charlie horse going off in both my back of my thigh and my calf. This goes on for hours before it loosens to a semi tolerable state for the day. Unless I you know… move at all.. My leg cramps in both places at once at the slightest bit of use and it is excruciating when I lift my leg up, onto a stool for instance, or try to look at the bottom of my foot which constantly tingles. If I tilt my head back (like to take medicine) or cough I have to first curl my leg up towards my chest and bend forward or curl into a fetal ish position to avoid sharp pain in my lower back and down my leg. I make gutteral birthing noises trying to get in or out of bed, and we won’t even talk about toilet time. I can barely perform basic hygiene without a hot sharp pain in the above mentioned places. 

I have an MRI on the 25th of July which was booked back on June 21. I cry every day. I’m taking Flexeril 5mg sometimes x3 at a time all day and following the Aleve and Acetaminophen recommendations etc. 

All I do is cry. I barely sleep. I can’t pick up my 2.5 year old without a very unpleasant pull in that lower right of my back. I can’t sit up from laying down, I have to roll onto my side and push myself up. I can’t stand from sitting or vice versa without burning pain in my leg and or back depending on the angle. 

ER visit resulted in dilaudid shot, toradol shot, decadron and oxycodone administered before discharge, oxycodone and Valium for 1 week at home. Lidocaine 5% patches. 
Saw PCP and was put on the flexeril for now.

1lwro1e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lwro1e,Big burr energy - Lagom 01,"Just showed up and I’m taking a break after grinding 15lbs of seasoning beans. 10lbs to go. I special ordered the 102mm SSP ULF Brew burrs which took an extra month+ to get, but the grinds have impressively uniform and fluffy. 

Initial thoughts:

1. It’s way smaller in person, than photos make it look. I have it pulled forward for the seasoning process so it dwarfs the A4Z behind it, but when it’s pushed back it doesn’t look oversized (at least to me) or offensive. No more of a visual tank than a Mazzer Philips. 

2. The documentation that comes with this is pathetic - two very small one page accordion leaflets. Going on their website isn’t much better - and the videos they have on their website often have the older model featured (without the prelim crushing system and slow feeder and has a twist off burr versus securing pins) and the process to take them apart and fiddle with different things is different and you sort of have to figure out the new on on your own with some things. 

3. The parts/materials are very nice and it is extremely well made. You know what you’re paying for when you interact with it. 

4. I love the sound the hopper shroud makes when you pour beans on it to grind. It sounds like you’re getting coins in Mario Brothers and the haptic feel of the power button is really nice and unique. I can’t recall ever feeling a button like this, it’s hard to describe but it’s very light and airy with a satisfying ultra light click engagement. 

5. When the grinder is on (with no beans in it) it’s very quiet - but once beans hit the burrs, good god is this thing LOUD. Grinding enough for. Pour over is no big deal as it munches through 15 grams of beans in just a couple of seconds, but when you dump 4-8oz in there and let it rip, it’s punishing. After 10lbs - my ears started to protest. Granted, prodigal seasoning beans are ultra light and very hard, but it’s still a beast when it’s munching darker beans (I tried). 

6. I love the chute clicker - and it works amazing, just like the tiny Lagom Casa… but the strange thing is the Casa’s chute clicker actually feels more robust and has a far more satisfying and aggressive click, which is quite strange. 

7. The plastic box it was shipped in was a bit of a let down. It did its job, and a few parts of it actually broke on the corners in shipping, but overall it’s still functional and reusable. While I don’t really need a full on travel case (it’s not a grinder I’m going to transport around) - it is a little odd that a Varia VS6 for 1/5 the price has a super nice pelican style custom case and the 1/6th of the cost A4Z has a really nice carrying case as well. It is worth noting the Weber EG-1 comes in a padded cardboard case, so the Lagom at least is a step beyond that. 

8. While this is more countertop and home friendly than the EK43 I had for a decade and a half, I’m going to go on record saying I think it’s an absolutely ridiculous thing to buy for home use. Yes, it’s true - I haven’t yet had a single cup of coffee from it yet, and I already know it’s going to make very good coffee (the grinds look insane) but this thing is so over the top for home use it’s really silly. I don’t regret buying it - and after living with an EK43 as long as I did, I’m used to (and so is my wife) having an absurd grinder in my home, but having spent the last ~6 months or so without a titan grinder, and still getting insanely good cups from small, quiet, tidy grinders like the Pietro, A4Z, ZP6 and C40/60 - I can honestly say it makes no sense to buy these monsters for home use.",12,1752190189.0,pourover,13,0.94,False

I’ve tried the local libraries but there are too many sussy people lol

I honestly usually go to Panera but same issue, there’s often not any outlets available. I prefer the ambiance though bc it’s pretty quiet, and I can hide away in a booth and work on my stuff, distraction-free. It’s also the only place I’ve studied at where I feel safe leaving my belongings at a table if I need to get up

I’m open to any suggestions !! Just trying to find a place that’s more on the lowkey/chill side, doesn’t get too busy/loud, and has seating, WiFi, and functioning outlets available. Hugeeee bonus if they’re open late and serve coffee for sure.

I’ve been struggling with autoimmune symptoms for years. My mood sucks, I’m constantly brain fogged and tired, my memory is horrible, any sort of stress makes me flare, my muscles are exhausted, my vocal cords struggle (I’m a singer), a lot of foods trigger me as well (sugar, caffeine, alcohol, gluten to name a few). I’ve ruled out every autoimmune condition but tested JUST out of range for Hashi antibodies only once or twice

I’ve been tossed around by a lot of medical professionals and I’m just sick and tired of being sick and tired. This new endo, without me even having to ask, introduced T3 into my medication regimen but decreased my synthroid from 75 mcg to 50, and I’ve felt like complete crap the last week and a half.

Last she checked my TSH and FT4, before changing my meds, they were ‘optimal’ by what I’ve read. I’m starting to cut out gluten and dairy and chill on the sugar. I can’t drink coffee or alcohol.

Not sure what I’m looking for here. Sympathy? Someone who’s struggling with the same? I haven’t felt myself in years. I’m just looking for hope I guess.

People with “optimal” labs: do you still feel like junk until you get your meds right?

I’ve gone to almost every speciality and have ruled out so many things but I am just so discouraged by feeling like shit day after day for the last 7 years.",3,1752189999.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False
1lwrl5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/highdesert/comments/1lwrl5n/introducing_startup_mojave/,Introducing Startup Mojave,"If you're interested in innovative entrepreneurship, we're building a startup community through a grassroots initiative called Startup Mojave. 

We've been at this for a couple years, and things are going well. We're a scrappy group of passionate local volunteers who have a strong positive vision for the future and are doing something about it. 

Personally, I have deep experience in tech, startups, traditional entrepreneurship, and corporate innvation — but most of us do not. We are designers, engineers, artists, hustlers, programmers, investors, etc. Ultimately, we're all figuring out together how to bring good innovation to the High Desert. 

All are welcome. 

• https://StartupMojave.org 

We focus on creating value and making the world better rather than getting rich quick. It's a growing community of entrepreneurial folks who support each other and are trying to bring good things to the High Desert. 

### Regular Events

Our regular weekly / monthly meetups include: 

• A Monday morning ""Open Coffee"" social meetup focused on mindset, mental models, business models, business development, and overcoming our current challenges

• A Thursday evening ""Brews & Breakthroughs"" social meetup at Consbeeracy Brewing focused on tech trends, innovation, and nurturing our entrepreneurial ecosystem.

• A 2nd Saturdays evening meetup focused on Cybersecurity 

• A 4th Saturdays evening meetup ""Hackers & Devs"" focused on programming and various software related things. 

These are all free and open to anyeone. They are listed on [Startup Mojave's Event Calendar page](https://StartupMojave.org/calendar) as well Eventbrite, Meetup, our Facebook Page, LinkedIn Group, etc. 

### 1 Million Cups

We're also about to launch 1MC Victor Valley, an event that takes place in over a hundred cities in the US. We'll be 1MC community number 111. It's held weekly on Wednesday mornings from 9am to 10am at The Dome on Nisqualli coworking space. Also free and open to all. 

This event is a wonderful support for small businesses and new ventures. Details here: 

• https://www.1millioncups.com/s/account/001Ur00000NruDPIAZ/victor-valley-ca

### Startup Weekend

Start a new, innovative business in a weekend! 

This event doesn't have a date yet, but we're bringing it the High Desert as soon as we have critical mass support. We're getting close. If you can help, send us a message. We've built a dedicated website to explain it here: 

• https://StartupWeekendVictorValley.com

### Please get connected

A couple of the biggest challenges we face in the High Desert are getting people connected and getting them moving. This region has not developed networks around these things yet, so most of us interested in innovation and such feel isolated. But we're not alone. Just disconnected. We're working to fix that.  

I encourage you to get on our mailing list and follow our socials. 

Other upcoming initiatives include:

• A maker community and a member-based makerspace  
• A 12-week technology startup incubator program  
• A localized ""entrepreneur's guide"" to resources and tools  
• An angel / venture capital investment meetup  
• A series of hands-on workshops about leveraging AI in your work

Come help us build the future together.",6,1752189974.0,highdesert,7,0.81,False

If we can get a group of at least 5 people willing to meet at a public coffee shop, that would be incredible. 

Any coffee shop works but preferably non chains. They have better vibes.

Totally optional but we can always do it via this app called 100 Coffees as well. It helps make the scheduling and meet up seamless.

In any case, if it qualifies, I do hope people drop by once it's ready for users.

EGGS. MEAT IS YOUR BESTFRIEND!! DAIRY. milky coffee (avoid outside food, just milk works as well! i like to add a french vanilla creamer to mine as i hate bitter food) nuggets, chicken tenders, kabaabs, wings.. LITERALLY are ur bestfriend! u can buy them at ur local grocery store & airfry them! its the best way truly. YOU CAN EAT AS MANY OF THEM. even chicken burger patties! do this for 2-3 months and u will thank me. im no expert, but i have cut down all carbs since 3 months and now im introducing them 1-2x a week (subway, fast food resturant) after losing 30lbs without suffering (meat, eggs, and dairy keep you FULL) goodluck to anyone hopefully someone finds this helpful :-) my main goal here was to show off a diet you can enjoy without just having the thoughts of going on salads (which is NOT awful but.. its not real food really even tho i love my chicken salads xx) you are suppose to enjoy what u do! so dont make it feel like work, enjoy it. (1 cup of coffee/milk is 100 calories approximately and 10g protein, 1 kebaab is 80 cals and 8g protein, 2 chicken strips are 160 cals and 8g protein, 3 wings are 200 cals and 14g protein, 1 egg is 80 cals and 6g protein..)

2 cups of coffee/milk with french vanilla creamer = 200 cals and 20g protein  
4 kebaabs = 320 cals and 32g protein  
4 chicken strips are = 320 cals and 16g protein  
6 wings are = 400 cals and 28g protein  
4 scrambled eggs are = 320 cals and 24g protein

you can always make few chances here n there these r just hypothetical examples. make sure ur doing ur 5k steps ATLEAST and drinking WATER (a must!!)

total = 1560 calories and 120g protein. no you will not feel hungry or suffer lol! (you can pm me if you want to see the brands i eat n all etc, but for now im happy and gonna maintain my weight xx)",0,1752189828.0,WeightLossAdvice,19,0.25,False

1lwre75,https://i.redd.it/xp4bfz7wq4cf1.jpeg,Unpopular Opinion,"Buckle in, because I've been sick in bed for a week now, and I'm antsy and bored and still sick and I've got thoughts. I'll also say that I love this community, I love, love, love SATC and have watched it at least 25 times all the way through over the years (with commentary on as well), and I love our girls. As do we all, because that's why we're here. And because deep down, we each hope that they can turn this self-indulgent show around. Please don't ⬇️ me too much! 

I agree that overall the writing, character development and show in general are not up to our expectations.  Because of life, I always end up reading posts in this sub before I actually watch the episode. I don't mind the spoilers bc I initially came here to hate watch, which I did for the first 1.5 seasons. (Seriously go back, Che is not that bad of a character. She does crappy things and Miranda does really crappy things, but as a character she is who she is and is not terrible. It was just incredibly jarring coming on the heels of Miranda decimating the best love story/happy ending with sweet, loveable Steve). Anyway, so I was lurking here, then watching and agreeing for the most part with what I was reading.

But I've started to notice something: I would come, read what you guys have to say and think to myself man, oh man am I going to hate this episode, then gleefully turn it on ready to hate with you. And then I would watch it and think, oh it wasn't that bad. And the same after the next week, and the next.

There are glimmers of SATC coming through. The Miranda treating and speaking about Mary as Che did to Miranda, the excellent editing and cinematography the back and forth shots between Miranda and Joy's dogs in the morning of last week's episode, Miranda's quip at the end to Seema about taking the whisper apartment to have more space for joy/Joy. (Miranda's fashion: Most improved, getting back to what she dressed like in SATC but current.)

And I know, many of you hated it, but Aidan jerking off in his truck felt VERY SATC to me (remember when we spent a whole episode watching Miranda getting fucked all over public Manhattan by Will Arnett, culminating in him humping her while looking at his intruding parents like a wild eyed hyena? And it was hilarious!!). SATC-esque while also  remaining true to the character of Aiden as a good, loving Dad. I.e. engaging in what could be viewed as deviant behavior (phone sex and masturbation) while being cognizant that it would be detrimental for his son to walk in on it or overhear it and instead taking said behaviors out in the middle of nowhere, assured of complete privacy. Instead, I am actually relieved that the AJLT team didn't fall back on the tired trope of Wyatt walking in on him. Could I have done without the pooping his pants comment? Yes, that seemed off brand for Aiden.

Carrie. Lots of comments and complaints about Carries big blank white walls and let's say, more whimsical Holly Hobbie clothing aesthetic. Is it possible that the blank walls are showing us that Carrie still isn't quite sure who she is without her husband? I am not saying that she isn't more than ready to move forward from Big, but that doesn't mean the character isn't still grieving or uncertain of next steps. Also, if she really is waiting for Aiden to make it their home it makes sense to wait to commit to the majority of wall hangings and furniture to include some of his and things that reflect their tastes. Fashion wise, I think Carrie is dressing at times like a blend of her and her character The Woman (🙄) to get a bit more into character for when she sits down to write.  As for her  reaction to Aidan sleeping with his ex. Again, I read what some of you wrote before I watched. But, I did see her facial reactions, including surprise,  shock, a bit of hurt. But, I also think that Carrie has also grown and evolved as a woman and New Yorker after all of the years of writing her column, dating in NYC, the back and forth with Big, and was being mature enough to vocalize that they never discussed or agreed what waiting for 5 years meant. In fact, I took her very calm reaction as one of mimicking Big's reaction to her admitting that she kissed Aiden in the second SATC movie. Big's face showed he was hurt, taken aback, and then he gave her grace (and that big honking ring). I would like to think (because I try to be an optimist) that Carrie learned from her past and would remember how kind and loving it was of Big to forgive her that mistake and in turn gave that kindness and forgiveness to Aiden. Do I know there's a massive difference between kissing and having sex? Yes of course, but when it comes to the Big/Carrie/Aiden triangle I think a kiss is tantamount to sex with Kathy. I was pleasantly surprised to hear her forgiveness followed with her admission that she hadn't necessarily intended to go without sex or maintain monogamy for 5 years. This felt very SATC with a touch of Samantha Advice to me. I think what we are watching is Carrie getting to know Aiden as a Dad and Carrie getting to know who she is as a widow in a transition with a situationship, and honestly that's as awkward and painful in real life as it is on screen. Carrie's fashion: Dressing like a Tan Fanning Sister. Said with love ❤️

Charlotte is the OG character that still needs the most work to me. Even towards the end of SATC she was feeling like non sexual comedic relief, or filler storyline. And it wasn't always a bad thing. First, I will just flat out say it even though it'snot nice: that this season Kristen Davis' face is starting to look better since starting to get rid of some of her fillers and that has helped acting as her character season. Her character has had some poignant moments this season (her and LTW in the pool) and I enjoyed Charlotte adamantly going back to work and vocalizing that she needs and deserves to do something for her and sticking to it. And props to Charlotte for giving us, aging, added weight while losing confidence and the reality of Spanx (blech on only losing the Spanx after a younger, cooler, noticeably heavier woman complimenting her).
But, my complaint is that in even when delivering slapstick comedy in SATC, Charlotte never, delivered her lines in such a consistently whiny, sing-song manner. When she did this in SATC it was almost always solely for the punchline or to highlight the absurdity of a situation (100% appreciated Harry calling her Pollyanna for the excellent  SATC callback to Miranda telling her don't you dare Pollyanna out on me today).
Hopefully now that she's getting more of a storyline that delivery will fall to the backburner. Because that scene with her and Carrie in the Depends aisle was touching and natural and felt so genuine to me because sometimes in real life you do get the worst news or have a breakdown in the middle of a drugstore. It reminded me of the gorgeous scene in SATC when Charlotte goes with Carrie back to her apartment after seeing Big's engagement announcement to Natasha in the Times. And Charlotte reads the announcement to Carrie and then holds and rubs her back as Carrie cries, lamenting that she just has the column that they run penis pump ads next to. Funny, heartbreaking, poignant and beautifully normal. Charlotte's fashion: It's called classic for a reason.

I think the crux of the problem is the writing and the pacing of the show. 
The scene where Brady met Joy we were given very succinct (perhaps even too succinct), clear writing used to firmly and quickly establish where everyone's feelings are prior to Brady's arrival and how complete (compared to other episodes) that storyline felt and knowing that no one is on the fence. The pacing in that scene follows a much quicker beat like SATC did, just as the episode where Miranda was on the phone to Carrie complaining about Mary. SATC has always given us archetypes because we can immediately jump in and know who is who and what they represent and get right into the storyline of what their sexual foibles are or aren't. It doesn't matter that we've never seen them before, we should be able to just jump in for the ride.We also occasionally got some repeat NYC archetypical characters as Skipper, Susan Sharon, Bitsy (I'm so surprised how many of you don't remember her from season 5! She was such a fabulous SATC character). So between those types of characters and pacing it kept the series relatable, funny, easy and grounded which made the dramatic bits that much more jarring, sharper, and heartbreaking. The clumsy insertion of millennial/Gen X/technology jokes makes the pacing of the delivery of those lines clunky which makes the show also feel clumsy, clunky, slow, and old, not self-aware. I looooved The Little House on the Carrie joke bc it felt 1) a bad joke SATC Aiden would have made 2) A very realistic joke for someone in their age ranges to make 3) it just felt like an SATC pun for better or worse. I hated the delivery of ""Miranda, I've fallen and I can't get up."" Faster delivery, quick cut to the next scene, no slow zoom in on her on the floor still won't make it a clever, retro joke but it would make it marginally funny. I loved Miranda's viral ""Wild Cunt-ryside"" moment. This sort of thing happens all of the time (Wheel of Fortune has given us many) and it was doubley delightful watching Brady tease her about it. 

This last week's episode with the veeeerry clunky (jokes wise) scene at Hot Fellas. I love Anthony but not every scene he is in should revolve around his boyfriend's dick. Anthony is better than that (SATC Anthony's delivery of, ""Chanel-lo!"" season 6). Which brings me to the new characters and the issue of overpacking the main cast. They need to add to Anthony's story or cut him from the main cast. I love him as Charlotte's chosen family, bff though and hope this doesn't happen. The scene with him and Carrie regarding Stanford did make me cry.

Seema. I genuinely like her, I like her voice, I like that she still smokes and I like her look. Her fashion has a strong pov without being overwhelming or in your face. I think that honestly they are doing as best as they can to have her fill the Samantha spot (although, Sam would say no woman can fill her, believe her, Maria tried 😉). I think they are being very smart and deliberate with us getting more frequent scenes with her and the OG 3 this season. She is now starting to mesh with the group and not just Carrie in their one on one scenes. But, they need to be more realistic about her financial problems. But, hey I actually know someone who owned his own insurance company, had a stroke, died and his wife found out they had no life insurance....so yeah a lot of people don't actually have a Plan B 🤷‍♀️

Which brings me to LTW whose fashion is the standout of the series. Her style never bores me and even when it is unbelievably over the top its is so wonderful that I can't be annoyed. LTW's storylines need to be fleshed out and more relatable. I enjoyed the family scene in the kitchen episode 1 with Herbert trying to be cool with 2 buttons undone and her questioning if she should include Michelle Obama. It was natural, well-paced. Previous seasons her scenes seemed too rushed or too surface. 

Which means that LTW has benefitted from us losing the most relatable cast member, Nya. I hate that she's gone but the show needed a better way to give full storylines instead of bits and pieces, so I get it but I also hate that there is now only 1 black main character. 


Things I still hate about the show:

SATC and Carrie's columnist pay grade, and the dates or friends of the week  allowed us to get a fantastic taste of varying levels of wealth and eccentricity, poor but cool and arty, poor young and hot, etc. Poor, but Carrie and her shoes 😉 But, all 4 of the OG girls were clearly working towards attaining more and amassing more money. And so now that they are there and at the ages they are (and this is true in real life) even your secondary circles, places and acquaintances will likely look much more like your inner circle did than when you were younger. So the show does have this very real problem now of how to show those varying degrees of wealth, let alone average, lifestyles. And for now they are leaning into the wealth for whatever reason. I like pretty things and pretty places, but I also don't like to be bored. So somehow this needs addressed. 

I wish that Nya and Charlotte had gotten to bond over infertility issues that then lead to marital issues and then to divorce; this feels like such an incredibly missed opportunity. Instead of tone deaf woke jokes in Season 1, we could have gotten a natural relationship formed out of Miranda saying, ""I haven't gone through what you have but my friend Charlotte has and it might help for you to talk to her.""  That would have added so much more depth to Charlotte and Nya as well as and given a natural place for that new friendship to grow. 

Like all of you have said, we need to see more of the actual city, actual places that are trending or interesting. 

Where is the sex? Yes, I get that this is not SATC but it is about relationships. Or at the very least, where are the conversations about perimenopause and menopause? I appreciate the actual penis pump scenes. Very unexpected, very funny.

I know I am missing more things that I still hate...til then....

Little things that I love about the show: 

● I love that we are aware of Lily's monogamous polyamorous relationship and that there are sometimes small jokes in regards to it, but that they aren't making a joke about it, nor is it getting special episodes or explanations, it's just accepted for what it is even if her parents don't totally get it. 

● I love Miranda's middle of the night naked bathroom run in with Carrie as well as her naked on the toilet at Carrie's house with the bathroom door open as she reads the newspaper and Shoe comes walking in and she shoos her away with the paper. Nice SATC callback to her dating Mr. No Boundaries (Jim Gaffigan) and breaking up with him over going to the bathroom with the door open in her apartment and her cat Fatty running out of the bathroom after he has a wet, loud fart. People can change sometimes? 

● Miranda & Seema apartment hunting scenes and convos together. That Carrie, although pushed by realizing her and Miranda living together wasn't working, that she asked Seema to help Miranda bc that is what would actually happen. 

● I love her red haired editor. Wonderfully written minor character in every episode she's in, fantastic actress.

● I loved seeing what the ultra stylish and intimidating Enid's life looks like at this point in her life. Double points for that D. 

There's more but... til then...here's where I'll get the downvotes:

I'll say, I lived for years in a very large, 100+ year old apartment building with apartments that were 1800 - 2800 sq ft, all hardwood floors, all 12 ft. ceilings (bathrooms 14 -16 ft ceilings). The shoe thing is real and is why I took moved to a top floor unit in the same building less than a year after moving in. The echo is real. The noise is real. 

Filming in Tiffany's is a very, very, very, very big deal. Even though it's ""just the regular sales floor and looks boring"" it is a massively big deal. 

This is not how I personally feel or live but, sometimes part of having massive, blank white walls is to show that you have the money to have the space to have massive white blank walls. Sometimes they are massive, blank and white to highlight art and its surroundings. Sometimes it's to feel and enjoy the space you do not get in NYC on the streets, in restaurants, in coffee shops, on the subway, etc. Regardless, Carrie's massive, white blank walls at the Grammercy house have more charm and warmth to them than the giant glass box of a condo she was temporarily in in S1.

If you made it this far, thank you for indulging me. I really am sick and tired of being sick and tired and this kept me occupied and resting. I love these characters and I am hopeful that I will love  this show. ",56,1752189469.0,Andjustlikethat,63,0.8,False

Okay, Reddit, I've been lurking for ages, but I finally had to post about this thing I bought. I'm talking about a smart mug – specifically, a temperature control mug. I know, I know, it sounds extra, but hear me out.

For years, my morning routine has been plagued by lukewarm coffee. I'm a 30-something working professional, WFH life, and I need my caffeine fix to be on point. I was constantly running to the microwave, which is a total time suck. I was tired of it. 😩

So, I caved and bought this temperature control coffee mug. I was drawn in by the promise of perfectly heated coffee that stays that way. Plus, I'm a bit of a tech nerd, so the app connectivity was a major selling point.

First impressions? This thing is sleek. It looks way better than my old, stained mug. It comes with a charging coaster, which is super convenient. Just set it down, and it charges. No more fumbling with cords! The low-level anxiety of my mug dying mid-sip is officially gone.

But the real magic is the temperature control. You can set the exact temperature you want your drink to be. I usually go for around 135°F (57°C) for my coffee. And it *stays* there. For hours! No more sad, cold coffee ruining my morning. It's a game-changer for those long meetings where I can't even think about getting up for a refill.

The app is surprisingly useful. You can set different temperatures for different drinks, which is pretty cool. I use it for coffee, tea, and even hot chocolate sometimes. It's kinda fun to feel like a barista, customizing everything to my exact liking. I never thought I’d be controlling my mug with my phone, but here we are. Makes me feel like I'm living in 2025. 😎

I was worried about the price at first. It's definitely more expensive than your average mug. But honestly, the convenience and the consistent temperature are worth it for me. Plus, I’m wasting less coffee now that I’m not letting half-finished cups go cold and down the drain. So, in a weird way, it's saving me money?

One unexpected benefit? It's a conversation starter. People see it on my desk during video calls and are always asking about it. Makes me feel a little fancy, I guess. 🤷‍♂️

I did a little digging before buying, and it seems like a lot of people are looking for the best smart mug for coffee. I think this one delivers. It solves that daily frustration of coffee getting cold too quickly. I was constantly reheating, and it was such a time suck. Now, I can just enjoy my drink at the perfect temperature without any effort.

I’ve found that the consistent temperature helps me really savor the flavor of my coffee, too. I’m not rushing to finish it before it gets cold, so I can actually relax and enjoy it. It’s a small thing, but it makes a big difference in my overall enjoyment of my morning routine.

I even use it for tea in the afternoon. I like my green tea a little cooler than my coffee, and the app makes it easy to adjust the temperature. It's nice to have that level of control.

I was browsing ursupermart.com the other day, and they seemed to have a decent selection of these types of things.

If you're someone who values convenience, quality, and a little bit of tech, I'd definitely recommend checking it out. If you're curious, you can find it here: https://go.ursupermart.com/Ilb3gB

Overall, I'm super happy with my purchase. It's a small thing, but it makes a big difference in my daily routine. No more cold coffee for this guy! ☕",1,1752189178.0,Problem_Solvrs,0,1.0,False

Alright Reddit, I’ve gotta spill the tea (or coffee, rather) about this smart mug I’ve been testing out. For years, I've been on a quest to conquer the dreaded lukewarm coffee situation. I'm talking multiple trips to the microwave every single morning. It's a real problem. 😩

So, I finally caved and bought one of those ""Temperature Control Mugs."" I know, it sounds a bit bougie. But the promise of perfectly heated coffee without the constant reheating cycle was too good to pass up. I'm a 30-something working professional, mostly working from home, and I really value convenience and quality. Plus, I'm a bit of a tech nerd, so the app connectivity definitely caught my eye.

My first impression? This thing looks pretty slick. It's definitely an upgrade from my old, chipped ceramic mug. It comes with this charging coaster, which is super convenient. No more messing with cords. You just set it down, and it charges wirelessly. The anxiety of my mug dying mid-sip is officially a thing of the past.

But the real magic is the temperature control. You can actually set the exact temperature you want your drink to be. I usually go for around 135°F (57°C) for my coffee. And it *stays* there.

Okay, so I've gotta share this thing I recently got. I'm a total coffee addict (and, okay, tea sometimes too ☕), but I HATE when my drink gets cold halfway through. Like, seriously, is there anything more annoying? I've tried travel mugs, those weird mug warmers that plug in... nothing really worked.

Then, I stumbled across this “Smart Mug” thing. I was skeptical. I mean, how “smart” can a mug *really* be? But the promise of perfectly temperature controlled coffee sucked me right in. Turns out, it's actually pretty awesome.

Basically, it keeps your coffee (or tea or whatever) at the EXACT temperature you want. No more lukewarm disappointments. And the best part? It does it for hours! I’m talking, I can actually savor my morning coffee now instead of chugging it down before it turns into sad, cold sludge.

This thing even comes with a charging coaster. It’s wireless, so you just plop the mug down on it when you’re not using it, and it stays charged up. No more worrying about batteries dying or anything like that. I can't tell you the peace of mind it gives me knowing my mug will always be ready! Plus, it looks really slick on my desk. It's got a kind of modern aesthetic, which I appreciate. Makes me feel a little less like I'm drowning in paperwork.

It connects to an app too! Yeah, I know, sounds extra, right? But it's actually super useful. You can set the exact temperature you want your beverage to be, down to the degree. And save your preferred settings if you are like me and have specific needs for specific teas. No more guessing or fiddling around. Plus, my inner tech geek gets a kick out of controlling my mug from my phone 🤓. It’s like something out of a sci-fi movie, but for coffee!

The biggest win for me is that I don't have to microwave my coffee anymore. Seriously, that's a game changer. Microwaved coffee always tastes kinda weird, right? This mug eliminates that completely. My coffee stays hot and tastes just as good as when I first poured it. And the little bit of time I save not having to get up and reheat it is clutch, especially when I’m in the middle of something important.

I've noticed I'm actually wasting less coffee too. Before, I'd often pour a big mug, only to end up dumping half of it out because it got too cold to enjoy. Now, I drink every last drop. I think that's a big win considering how expensive my coffee beans are.

I was telling my buddy Mark about it the other day, and he was like, ""Isn't that just another overpriced gadget?"" And I get where he's coming from. But honestly, for me, it's been worth every penny. I’m way more productive and I'm able to really enjoy my drinks. I usually buy my stuff at ursupermart.com, but this time I saw a targeted ad for it and was drawn in!

If you're like me – someone in their late 20s to mid-50s who values convenience, quality, and a little bit of tech in their life – and you're tired of cold coffee or tea ruining your day, I seriously recommend checking this thing out.

If you're curious, you can check it out here: https://go.ursupermart.com/Ilb3gB

Basically, if you are looking to buy a smart mug, you can save time and get better-tasting coffee... you won't be disappointed!

I hope this helps and please let me know if you guys have any questions about it! I'm no expert but I can share my experience and maybe save you some cold coffee misery.

1lwr555,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lwr555,Please help my Carissa Macrocarpa! :(,"Hello! I am wondering if anyone could please help me with my carissa macrocarpa (natal plum tree)?

I love this plant dearly, but it's not been doing so well lately. I got the plant in October 2024, and it started dropping leaves in November or December. And what was weird was that the leaves seemed perfectly healthy; it's possible that maybe that's normal for this species of plant, but this is my first time having one. I didn't even know what it was for months, and carissa macrocarpa seemed to be my best attempt at ID-ing it. It's likely that I was providing incorrect care for the species during the time it took me to ID it.

It started dropping leaves drastically between February and March of 2025. Since March, it has been so unstable in terms of how much it will appear to dry out vs looking well enough, etc. Many of the leaves now dry up to a point that they are incredibly crisp, but don't fall off necessarily. 

The other leaves that don't fall off seem to be a paler, less deep green color than they once were, and feel flimsy and bendable in nature. In May, I repotted it, wondering if it needed soil with slightly better drainage, so I did a mix of it's original soil along with a bonsai soil that I got, and put it into another pot with drainage holes. As you can see in pictures 14 through 20, it once was much healthier looking. It had leaves that were a rich, deep green color and were glossy and firm to the touch (whereas now, the leaves are either flimsy, or dried out and brittle, like in the pictures before). 

For additional information, I used to water it twice a week when it was doing it's best. From about October 2024 to February 2025, I watered it twice a week and had no issues. I changed the watering frequency since it started dropping leaves, and began watering it only when the soil seemed thoroughly dry. Now I just don't know when it how often it's best to water it. The dry and brittle leaves made me think it was being underwatered. But what apepeared to be fungus gnats, along with a reading on a plant soil moisture meter that I recently got indicated that there was a lot of excess water...so now I'm worried about root rot?
 
Aside from that, the plant has almost always stayed on the windowsill of my apartment, which faces south west, and oddly gets many hours of direct light, or at least as many as possible until the sun sets. I've moved it off of the windowsill and to the coffee table a couple of feet away once or twice when I noticed 2 or 3 deep red leaves, which I figured was likely sunburn. 

That's as much info I can think of right now, but if anyone has any questions, please feel free to comment below! I have a new pot with better drainage, a bag of tropical plant soil, rooting powder, anti fungal treatment, and fungus gnat treatment all at hand if those will come in handy...

Any and all help towards trying to save my plant would be much appreciated! I really do love it so much and would hate to lose the plant...thank you in advance for any help or advice.",1,1752188817.0,plantclinic,0,1.0,False

That was me yesterday. I made coffee without forgetting the kettle. Folded laundry straight out the dryer. Actually caught a sunbeam on the landing and stood there for a second like someone in an antidepressant advert. I thought, this is good. I’m levelling out.

Anyway, that’s when the sock incident happened.

I was mid reset. Putting things away. Being proactive. I went to carry a basket back to the wardrobe when I stepped over a sock. Just one. Centre of the hallway like it had been placed. Not dropped.

I sighed. Picked it up.

It was… damp.

Not soaked. Not peed on. No bite marks or visible mess. Just mysteriously, deliberately damp. Like it had been in a mouth. Not for play. Not out of panic. Just held. Saturated. Deposited.

I froze.

Luna was on the windowsill behind me, doing her classic I’ve been sleeping here all afternoon act. Her eyes were closed. Too closed.
Betty was nearby, halfway under the bed, blinking not startled, not asleep. Just blinking like she knew something I didn’t.

I stood there, holding this lukewarm, saliva heavy sock in a clean hallway, and something shifted.

This wasn’t about the sock. This was a message.

I walked into the bedroom. The other sock from that pair still perfectly folded was now sitting on my pillow.

Unfolded. Dry.
But not where I left it.

It was like the sock version of a ransom note. One wet, one clean. One left where I’d trip. One left where I sleep.

I don’t know what I did. I don’t know when I did it.
But they definitely do.
And they want me to know they know.

I still haven’t put the socks away. I can’t. They’re evidence now. I didn’t sleep well. Every time I closed my eyes, I kept thinking there’d be a damp tea towel in the sink or a single rice grain on my phone screen.

They don’t yell. They don’t break things. They just adjust the atmosphere until you feel insane.
