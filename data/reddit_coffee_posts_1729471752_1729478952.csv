1g8fu7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g8fu7m/aitah_for_telling_a_guy_the_reason_i_gave_him_my/,AITAH for telling a guy the reason I gave him my number? ,"For context, I (32f) ended a long term relationship of 5 years just this past summer. There’s more to what led to the breakup than this, but it’s important to note that part of how my ex and I got together was through having similar Christian faith and worldview. I was a Christian for many years, but deconstructed to agnosticism about two years ago. My ex and I managed to stay together for a few more years despite that, however it (among other issues) eventually caught up to us. Ultimately, the relationship didn’t work out. Now, I am four months post-breakup and have started to dabble in dating apps a bit. It’s my first time in the dating realm as a non-Christian. So instead of trying to match with possible future pastors, or men with more fundamental values, I have now been matching with more progressive, agnostic/atheist men. 

Another important bit of context: when it comes to dating apps, I have a boundary where I do not typically give out my phone number to someone I match with until after I’ve met them in person over something simple, like coffee or lunch. If we hit it off, I give them my phone number in the chat after  I get home, and then we plan a more “proper” date. Not that coffee or lunch isn’t a date necessarily, but it’s a bit more on the casual friend side in these situations

Three days ago, I matched with a man (we’ll call him Michael, 42m). Michael’s dating profile made it clear that he was agnostic and progressive just like I was. We matched on the app and started chatting. He seemed intelligent and well spoken. He was very passionate about social issues, which I really appreciated. We also had a lot of other things in common outside of our religious and political stances, such as similar hobbies. We were having really good conversation and we’re hitting it off.  

The conversation between Michael and I started to take a bit more of a spicy/flirty turn when we started joking about having sex in a church for fun. I’ll admit, I was a little bit turned on by it. So even though it went against my initial boundary (which he was aware of), I said, “I’m not usually this forward, but do you want my number?” He said yes, but only if I was comfortable. I assured him I was and gave him my number. I think the spicy church sex conversation mixed with us hitting it off in general just sort of pushed me over the edge. We then switched to texting, and over the next couple of days, he would casually bring up the fantasy and I would just flirt back, but also try to simmer it down a bit. 

Just a couple of hours ago, he texted “Can I ask what made you feel comfortable enough to give me your number?🙂”. I was a little taken aback by the question, but I was honest with him, and told him that I enjoyed talking to him, and the church sex fantasy sort of pushed me over the edge. He was silent for a while, and then replied “Oh” I said “haha yeah, I’ll admit it was kind of hot.” He just said “It was.” I sent a smiley face, and he replied with just a thumbs up. I felt like something was off. So I apologized if I had somehow offended him, but then he said “I'm not sure what I'm feeling right now. A bit hurt and confused but I do like you. I thought I had simply made that much of an impression that you wanted to talk off the app. Especially since you said that it was out of character for you to be that forward.” I tried to assure him that he wasn’t wrong about that, and that maybe the fantasy was sort of the cherry on top of a sundae. Or rather just what pushed me over the edge. He then responded “Par for the course, I suppose.” He had mentioned early on in the conversation that the reason he was single at 42 was because women were either not as interested in him as he was, or vice versa. His use of this phrase rubbed me the wrong way, because it was as if he was assuming that I was only interested in the fantasy. Nevertheless, I apologized again and just said “it was nice talking to you. I hope you have a good week.” He responded back with “Take care.” I assume I won’t be hearing from him again. 

I was just talking with a couple of friends about this, one thinks that there was nothing wrong with my answer and that Michael was just overthinking it. The other thought I was the asshole because they could see where it sounded like I was only interested in the fantasy rather than him. So I thought I would bring it here. AITAH for telling a guy I matched with that I gave him my number mostly because I was turned on by a fantasy that we created together, but at the same time was starting to like him?

I put the dark walnut stain on about 10 years ago with a friends help- they had all the equipment and knowledge so I’m starting from scratch with noob level knowledge. 

I read that you’re not supposed to go up more than 40 ish in grit strength. That being said, I started sanding at 80, and the google directions I found said to sand again at 180 and 220 before staining. The sheets I bought don’t have 180, they go from 80 to 120 to 150 to 220. Can I replace the 180 with 150, or is that 180 really important?

Like so many, I'm convinced it has some connection to my gut health even though cardiologist and gastroenterologist both said no, and that everything seems fine.  
 Anyways, I've been meeting with success over the past while (after 10 months of these PVC episodes) so I thought I would share my strategy:
- stopped any obvious triggers (coffee, alcohol)
- started logging everything I was eating. I mean everything!
- logging any burping / bloating / heartburn and of course PVCs. Part of the log was documenting the severity of the PVCs
-  strict about regular exercise (5x a week)
- and gross as it sounds, also started logging bowel movements

A few patterns emerged:
- I found new potential food triggers as well as saw that it's not always about the last thing that I ate.
- The simple act of logging / labelling the severity of the episodes felt like I was actually doing something, which helped with feeling of helplessness.
- I've always had questionable gut health, but documenting everything showed that constipation is a HUGE trigger.  Small changes to my diet just for this has been the biggest improvement yet. 
- seeing the connection between my gut health and the PVCs (as well as the exercise), makes me feel better about my heart health, which in turn lowers the anxiety around the episodes/flare-ups when the do happen. They feel bad, they are inconvenient, but they are NOT killing me.

6 days out of the past month I've had episodes, but just 3 months ago that number would have been more like 26. 

Anyways, I hope this helps and thanks to so many of you for sharing your stories.",1,1729478782.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

Our 6 month old was doing very well with exposure training for the first two months we had him. Trips to Home Depot, coffee shops, restaurants. He’d show great manners and body language in public with people and other dogs. 

Around the house he has picked up the dachshunds behaviors of barking at passersby/ running to the front fence (5 ft vinyl fence). In public and on walks he’s started to bark at any dog in sight (we keep distance) and has had a few melt downs. 

We’re going to a trainer in a few weeks but I’d like to see what’s worked for others in a similar multi dog household.

**Lyrics**

[Verse 1]

Pullin’ off the highway, got a long road ahead,


Dusty old sign, yeah, it’s time to rest my head.


Neon lights flicker, like a beacon in the night,


Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, everything feels just right.

[Chorus]

Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, where the stories never end,

Road-weary travelers, find a place to mend.

Laughs and late-night tales, over beers and gin,

At Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, let the good times begin.

[Verse 2]

Rooms are kinda quirky, but the vibe is always warm,

Grumpy old cat lounges, keeps the place from harm.

Motel coffee brewin’, gotta grab a cup or two,

Chatting with the locals, they’re as wild as they’re true.

[Chorus]

Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, where the stories never end,

Road-weary travelers, find a place to mend.

Laughs and late-night tales, over beers and gin,

At Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, let the good times begin.

[Bridge]

Underneath the stars, by the fire’s glow,

Tales of love and laughter, the miles come and go.

With every friendly face, I feel right at home,

In this quirky little spot, I never feel alone.


[Chorus]

Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, where the stories never end,

Road-weary travelers, find a place to mend.

Laughs and late-night tales, over beers and gin,

At Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, let the good times begin.

[Outro]

So if you’re out there drivin’, needing to unwind,

Stop at Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, leave your worries behind.

Every road leads somewhere, but this one feels like kin,

Did not eat anything Sunday am but had coffee and water to drink. Hopped on indoor bike and did a race on Zwift. My HR was fine, typical 145-155 for most of the event but at 30 min. I could tell I had no real power. I needed to settle in at Z2. I am very active on Zwift and do quite a bit of racing. I know the GLP does something to balance our insulin levels and am wondering if other have experienced similar impact to their workouts. 

I love racing on Zwift and it is my main form of working out now that my knee has arthritis in it. 

Wondering if this is just due to built up fatigue from racing on Saturday, if I should have eaten more carbs before the race, or this is going to be my new norm going forward. 

Any similar experiences?

Is there a doctor/nurse that could explain why after 30 minutes of moderate cycling I had zero 'glucose' left in my system to power my legs for the rest of the race?

1g8f5f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1g8f5f4/i_cant_do_this_anymore/,I cant do this anymore,"Is it normal to feel this way or am I just torturing myself?

So i moved back home in March, started talking to this girl and just to put it out there, she told me she did not have feelings after hanging out for about a month. Nonetheless we continued to hangout but it got progressively more lovey dovey as time went on, i.e cuddling, kissing, sleeping at her place, sex.

She told me every day that she did not want to date me but continued to ask what i was doing and if i wanted to hangout. We start hanging out basically every day at some point, whether it was at either houses or just getting a coffee in the morning. About 3 months go by of that, and she finally said what the hell and we went out to dinner and i made her my girlfriend. The relationship stressed her out, she was drinking more and just seemed extremely anxious all the time. She put it on me like it was my fault because she felt so pressured to make me happy. Which i was so into her so i didn’t see why she felt that way.

We fought all the time, mostly on her part because anything and everything pissed her off. She is one gorgeous woman so i feel like i was blinded by all the red flags because of that. But i got so comfortable with this woman and i opened up, as did she, and now here we are separated for over a month already.

We’ve been texting even though she knows how bad she hurt me. I’ve told her that I’m hurt and i want her back but she just wanted to be friends. I tried so hard to be, but i couldn’t take it. I texted her so many times telling her how i felt which i know was wrong and i was acting in the moment of how i felt. About a week after the breakup, we went to go for a drive and talk and she made it clear that she is already back on Hinge.

I called her yesterday, telling her i miss her and everything and she got sick of it. She blocked me on all social media platforms, including my number. She included ghat she does not hate me, but it became to be too much for her. She included and i quote “i told you i needed space and you wouldn’t give that to me. If you contact me again or message me from someone elses phone, we’re gonna have a big issue because thats harassment.” 

Though the relationship was shaky, we did so much together in a short time. Cider mill in our home town, trip to NYC, she even broke her foot and i was with her at the hospital the whole time. After that i took care of her all the time.

Today is day 1 with no contact at all and i know she went out with her friends last night to bars. The amount of pain i’m feeling is unlike any other. Shortly before the breakup, we were driving and she accidentally slipped up and said “i love you” i looked at her and my eyes widened l. She knew i had caught her saying that and it was the greatest feeling ever. So how can she just get up and leave?

I’m just waiting for her to unblock me and text me but at this point, i don’t think that’ll ever happen again. I try going to the gym, hanging with family and friends, but nothing is helping. I just want her back. 

I have lost myself. I don’t enjoy the things i once did. My parents don’t understand because dating is so different now. I feel like ive been used for my kindness. I never want to love again. I am so tired. I haven’t had more than 4 hours of sleep in weeks. Eating dinner with my parents is even harder. I don’t want to anything with anyone. I need someone to talk to.

Upon opening my eyes, I found myself not amidst the familiar fog of London but enveloped in a different kind of mist—a gentle haze that softened the edges of an unfamiliar skyline. Towering structures of steel and glass stretched toward the heavens, reflecting a sun that seemed more vibrant than any I had known. A nearby sign proclaimed, ""Welcome to San Francisco."" How I arrived here was a mystery, but the greater enigma was the city itself.

As I ventured into the bustling streets, I was immediately struck by the attire of the inhabitants. Men and women alike adorned themselves in garments that defied convention. Gentlemen wore trousers of a coarse blue fabric, frayed at the edges, and shirts emblazoned with obscure symbols and phrases. Ladies paraded in attire that revealed more than it concealed, their hair dyed in hues that mimicked the plumage of exotic birds.

But more perplexing than their dress was the small, rectangular device nearly everyone clutched. With eyes transfixed upon glowing screens, they navigated the crowded sidewalks with a disconcerting ease, seldom acknowledging their surroundings or each other. It was as if these devices commanded their very souls.

Curiosity compelled me to approach a young man seated at a sidewalk café, his fingers dancing across the illuminated surface of his apparatus.

""Pray tell, sir,"" I began, ""what is this contrivance that so captivates your attention?""

He looked up, startled. ""It's a smartphone,"" he replied, as if the term were self-explanatory.

""A marvel indeed. And its purpose?""

He chuckled. ""Everything. Communication, information, entertainment—you name it.""

""Fascinating,"" I mused. ""And does it not weary the mind to be so constantly engaged?""

He shrugged. ""It's just how things are.""

Leaving him to his device, I continued my exploration. I entered a grand marketplace called a ""mall,"" where shops displayed an abundance of goods that seemed to serve little practical purpose. There were shoes with soles as thick as books, garments intentionally tattered, and devices promising to make one's coffee by merely pressing a button.

In one establishment, I observed patrons purchasing beverages called ""lattes"" and ""espressos,"" each concoction more elaborate than the last. The prices listed seemed exorbitant for mere cups of coffee. A sign boasted of beans sourced ethically from distant lands, yet the patrons appeared more interested in photographing their drinks than consuming them.

Venturing further, I encountered a park where groups engaged in an activity known as ""yoga."" Men and women twisted their bodies into improbable shapes, eyes closed in deep concentration. Nearby, others jogged in place, their ears plugged with cords attached to their devices, oblivious to the world around them.

The city's transportation was another source of wonder. Carriages moved without horses, guided by unseen forces and often occupied by a single individual. Despite these technological miracles, the streets were congested, and progress was slow. Strangely, many opted for contraptions resembling the velocipedes of my era, now termed ""bicycles,"" favoring pedal power over mechanical engines.

As evening approached, I observed a peculiar ritual. People gathered at elevated points to witness the ""sunset,"" a spectacle that occurred daily yet was met with communal reverence. They raised their devices to the sky, capturing images to be shared instantly with others not present.

Intrigued by this need for constant connection, I sought out a place called a ""social media lounge."" Here, individuals sat side by side yet communicated through their devices rather than conversing directly. They projected curated versions of their lives into the digital ether, seeking validation in the form of ""likes"" and ""followers.""

I couldn't help but reflect on the paradoxes before me. In an age where communication was instantaneous and boundless, genuine human interaction seemed scarce. The pursuit of health and well-being was fervent, yet the air was thick with fumes from countless vehicles, and the food was often processed beyond recognition.

The inhabitants championed individuality, yet flocked to the same trends, their expressions of uniqueness paradoxically uniform. Art and self-expression adorned every surface, from murals on buildings to tattoos on skin, yet much of it seemed transient, lacking the depth of true craftsmanship.

As night fell, the city transformed once more. Lights flickered on, not to illuminate the darkness for safety or utility, but to create an ambiance, a constant stimulation of the senses. Music emanated from establishments called ""clubs,"" where people gathered not to enjoy melodies but to lose themselves in cacophonous beats and libations.

Overwhelmed by the sensory onslaught, I sought refuge in a quiet corner. A newspaper stand caught my eye—a relic amidst the modernity. I purchased a paper, eager for something familiar, only to find it filled with sensational stories and fleeting scandals, a reflection of the society's appetite for the immediate and the trivial.

In contemplation, I concluded that San Francisco was a city of contradictions—a place where advances intended to simplify life had complicated it, where connections had become superficial despite the tools to deepen them. The inhabitants were ensnared in a relentless pursuit of the next novelty, the next fleeting pleasure, seldom pausing to reflect on the substance of their lives.

As I pondered my return to a time and place more measured, I carried with me a newfound appreciation for the virtues of restraint and the richness of direct human engagement. Perhaps progress was not merely the accumulation of innovations but the wisdom to use them in enhancing the human experience rather than fragmenting it.

  
**Chapter XIII: The House of Artificial Minds**

Determined to delve deeper into the peculiarities of this era, I resolved to engage more directly with its inhabitants. During my wanderings, I overheard whispers of a place where machines were taught to ""think""—an establishment known as OpenAI. Intrigued by the notion of artificial intellects, I sought out their headquarters, a modern edifice of glass and steel that seemed to pulse with an unseen energy.

Upon entering, I was greeted by a lobby that combined austerity with a strange warmth. The walls were adorned with abstract art, perhaps representations of the enigmatic processes occurring within. A young woman approached me, her attire casual yet her demeanor professional.

""Welcome to OpenAI,"" she said with a courteous smile. ""How may I assist you today?""

""Good day, miss. I am a traveler seeking to understand the workings of your establishment. Might I inquire about the nature of your pursuits here?""

She raised an eyebrow, perhaps amused by my formal speech. ""Certainly. We specialize in developing artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.""

""Artificial intelligence, you say? Minds fashioned by man rather than by the Almighty?""

""In a manner of speaking,"" she replied. ""We create algorithms and models that can learn and perform tasks.""

""Fascinating. Might I observe this marvel?""

She hesitated but then nodded. ""We offer guided tours. Let me see if I can arrange one for you.""

Soon after, I was introduced to a gentleman named Dr. Harris, who agreed to show me around. As we walked through corridors lined with glass-walled rooms, I observed individuals intently focused on their screens, streams of indecipherable symbols cascading before them.

""These are our researchers and engineers,"" Dr. Harris explained. ""They're training models to understand and generate human-like text.""

""Pray, what is the purpose of such an endeavor?""

He smiled. ""The applications are vast—improving customer service, aiding in education, even assisting in creative writing.""

We entered a room where a group was gathered around a display. Sentences appeared and rearranged themselves in real-time.

""Here, we're teaching the AI to comprehend context and nuance in language,"" Dr. Harris said.

I leaned in closer. ""But can a creation of man truly grasp the subtleties of human emotion and thought?""

He considered this. ""We're making progress. While AI doesn't 'feel' emotions, it can be trained to recognize and respond appropriately to them.""

At this, a young engineer joined our conversation. ""We're also working on ethical guidelines to ensure the AI is used responsibly.""

""Ethical guidelines for machines—how intriguing. But tell me, do you not fear that imbuing machines with such capabilities might lead to unintended consequences?""

Dr. Harris exchanged a glance with the engineer. ""That's a topic of much debate. We believe in the potential for good but remain vigilant about the risks.""

As we proceeded, I noticed a room labeled ""Reinforcement Learning."" Inside, simulations played out on screens—virtual environments where AI agents learned through trial and error.

""Here, the AI learns from its mistakes, improving over time,"" Dr. Harris explained.

""Much like a child touching a flame and learning of its heat,"" I mused.

""Exactly.""

I couldn't suppress a growing unease. ""Yet, unlike a child, the AI lacks consciousness. It does not suffer, nor does it rejoice. Is there not something disconcerting about creating entities that mimic understanding without truly possessing it?""

The engineer responded thoughtfully, ""Our goal isn't to replicate consciousness but to create tools that can assist us.""

""Tools, indeed. But tools have limits. What happens when the line between tool and autonomous actor blurs?""

Dr. Harris sighed. ""These are important questions. We have teams dedicated to AI safety to address such concerns.""

We entered a lounge where employees congregated. The atmosphere was relaxed—people laughed, sipped beverages, and engaged in animated discussions.

I approached a group and posed a question. ""Pardon me, but do you ever worry about the implications of your work on society at large?""

A woman with bright eyes replied, ""Of course. We regularly discuss the social impact. It's why transparency is a key part of our mission.""

""Transparency is admirable,"" I acknowledged. ""But how do you ensure that the fruits of your labor are not misused by others with less noble intentions?""

She nodded. ""We can't control all external factors, but we can set standards and collaborate with policymakers to promote ethical use.""

Another added, ""We're also committed to open research, so the benefits of AI are shared broadly, not just concentrated among a few.""

I appreciated their earnestness but remained skeptical. ""Yet, history has shown that advancements, however well-intentioned, can lead to unintended disparities and dependencies.""

Dr. Harris interjected gently, ""Change often brings challenges, but it also offers opportunities for improvement.""

""Perhaps,"" I conceded. ""But I wonder if in your pursuit to augment human capability, you risk diminishing the very qualities that make us inherently human—our capacity for critical thought, our reliance on intuition, our moral compass.""

The group fell silent for a moment. Then the woman replied, ""It's a balance we're striving to achieve. AI is a tool, and like any tool, its value depends on how we use it.""

As the tour concluded, I thanked Dr. Harris and the others for their time. Stepping back onto the streets of San Francisco, I contemplated the experience. The individuals at OpenAI were intelligent and conscientious, aware of the potential perils of their work yet optimistic about its promise.

However, I couldn't shake a lingering concern. In their quest to create machines that emulate human thought, were they not inadvertently encouraging a reliance on artificial judgments over human discernment? The more society depended on these constructs, the less it might value the imperfect but essential faculties that define our humanity.

I recalled the countless faces engrossed in their devices, the shallow interactions mediated by screens, and the commodification of experiences. It seemed that as technology advanced, the essence of direct human connection and introspection waned.

Yet, perhaps all was not lost. The very debates occurring within OpenAI's walls signified a recognition of these dilemmas. If those at the forefront of innovation remained vigilant, fostering open dialogue and prioritizing ethical considerations, there might be hope for a future where technology and humanity coexisted harmoniously.

As I continued my journey through this paradoxical city, I resolved to engage more deeply with its people—not merely to observe and judge but to understand. For it is through genuine interaction that one might bridge the chasm between skepticism and acceptance, between caution and embrace.

In the end, perhaps the true measure of progress is not the sophistication of our inventions but the wisdom with which we integrate them into the tapestry of human life.

When she found out Stewie would be short she asked the Doctor if there was a chance of him dying at 14 and actually seemed happy about the possibility of that!

She also has several counts of kidnapping, Attempted murder, Murder, Child abuse, Fraud, grandtheft auto.  Harassment, and in the current seasons domestic violence!

She would constantly mistreat Peter and I get Peter as an idiot and he sometimes deserves it but sometimes he would make a mistake and Lois decides the best idea is to make him miserable hitting him with a magazine, Shooting him, Making him sleep outside, Not to mention she was sleeping with other men way before Peter did in series!

Plus there are a handful of episodes where Peter actually bonds with his kids. The only time lowest bonds with her kids is if she's trying to make herself look good or if she does something horrible and just wants her kids to be on her side!

You shower. You shower quickly though. The warm water is inviting, but you are late. You even forgot to shampoo. There is no time. 

You skip breakfast. You skip brushing your teeth. You don't pack a lunch, you tell yourself that you'll go out for lunch today. You hurry to put your clothes on and get out the door.

On your drive to work, things are eerily quiet. Few cars on the road. You just assume this is normal post rush hour traffic. It's been a while since you've seen this traffic. You remember you have a few vacation days left and your office has a use it or lose it policy. Those vacation days won't carry over next year. Your subconsciously start fantasizing about ways to use your remaining vacation before the end of the year.

You park and walk to into your office. Everything is quiet. Is this what it's normally like? Usually, you come in during the morning when people are still casually walking to their office, sipping their coffees and chatting with colleagues. Now everyone is on their floor, in their cubicle, working. Right?

When you make it to your floor, the office is dead silent. No phone calls. No Microsoft Teams meetings. No casual co-worker chit chat. 

You walk past the break room into the cubicle area. No one is there.

You sit down at your computer. Maybe there was an announcement you missed You rush to check your email. But before you can sign in, your boss walks up behind you.

""Boss, sorry I'm late--""

""I'm glad you're okay""

""Huh?"" 

Your boss is normally very busy. Something seems to be bugging him, You've never seen him emotionally vulnerable like this.

""I sent everyone else home for the day to evacuate. I'm packed up and ready to leave too, I just wanted to stay and let you know in case you were late""

""What's going on?""

""There are major forest fires to the south"".

""How major?"" You look out the window of your hilltop office building. Way off to the south you notice some smoke on the horizon. It looks like it's coming from the far side of the opposing mountains.

""Major enough we've been advised to be ready to evacuate. A lot of people already emailed me telling me that they've already done so and were working remote from hotel rooms or their friend's houses. You don't have to work today. Just get to safety"".

You nod. ""Thank you boss"".

Imagine a job where you're in control of your hours, driven by skill and strategy rather than the monotony of routine. This is the life of a full-time forex trader and head coach. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just dipping your toes into forex trading, you're likely eager to understand what goes into crafting a successful trading day. Let's dive into a typical day packed with insights, tips, and strategies to elevate your trading game. 

MORNING ROUTINE: THE CALM BEFORE THE MARKET STORM
I believe success begins with the right mindset, nurturing both physical and mental health. My day starts at 6:00 AM with a quick jog to get the blood flowing and clear the mind. By 6:45, I’m sipping a fresh cup of coffee while reviewing global financial news. Staying updated is crucial as it allows me to anticipate market volatility and adjust my strategies accordingly. Remember, the market is a global arena—economies, politics, and society all play pivotal roles in currency fluctuations.

PRO TIP:
Stay ahead of the curve by subscribing to reliable financial news sources. For personal insights and expert analysis, I recommend subscribing to our premium newsletter on Substack [https://henryzhang.substack.com/].

MORNING ANALYSIS: SETTING THE STAGE
With news digested and breakfast at the table, 7:30 AM marks the start of my in-depth market analysis session. Reviewing charts, analyzing trends, and setting up potential trades, this quiet hour is dedicated to plotting the day’s roadmap. I apply a mix of technical analysis and fundamental strategies, always adjusting to the market's rhythm.

STAY INFORMED:
Join our exclusive Discord community (https://whop.com/trading-entrepreneur [https://whop.com/trading-entrepreneur]) for real-time discussions and insights from fellow traders. It’s a great platform for honing your strategies with feedback from a vibrant community.

MID-MORNING: EXECUTION AND COACHING
By 9:00 AM, the New York session is gearing up, and it's time to capitalize on volatility. Execution requires precision and quick decision-making, and that’s where decades of experience make a difference. As I execute trades, I'm also mentoring fellow traders, sharing live market insights and answering questions in our online coaching sessions.

SUCCESS STORY:
One of my mentees, Sarah, began with no prior knowledge of forex. Through disciplined mentorship and her commitment, she's now running her trading desk, consistently hitting her profit targets. Insights aren't just tips—they're stepping stones for growth.

LUNCHTIME CHECK-IN: REEVALUATION AND ADAPTATION
By 12:30 PM, it's crucial to revisit earlier positions. Markets are dynamic; they move fast and unpredictably. Reviewing morning trades, adjusting positions, and reassessing the market landscape ensures that we’re not just reacting but anticipating changes.

AFTERNOON STRATEGY: FOCUSED LEARNING AND STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT
1:30 PM is all about strategy enhancement. Reading economic reports, analyzing afternoon market behavior, and updating our strategic framework are key to long-term success. Each afternoon, we host comprehensive webinars and discussions, empowering community members to stay ahead.

ACTION POINT:
Enroll in our Advanced 0DTE Trading Course on Thinkific [https://henryzhang.thinkific.com/pages/mastering-0dte-options-course] to master the art of zero-day options trading. Our course is designed to teach both foundational and advanced strategies, fitting seamlessly into your trading arsenal.

EVENING WRAP-UP: REVIEW AND RECHARGE
By 4:00 PM, the day winds down. It’s time for journaling trades—assessing losses, celebrating wins, and strategizing for tomorrow. Reflecting on the day hugs the learning process tight, ensuring constant growth.

FINAL THOUGHTS: CONNECTING WITH LIKE-MINDED TRADERS
As the sun sets, connecting with fellow traders is both therapeutic and enlightening. Networking is a way to share, learn, and grow together. Remember, trading is not just about numbers; it’s about community, strategy, and continuous learning.

GET INVOLVED:
Invest in your growth by joining our premium communities and courses. Stay updated, stay informed—because your trading future is a newsletter, a click, and a lesson away from elevation.

Conclusion
Navigating the life of a forex trader and coach is both rewarding and challenging. By fostering the right mindset, maintaining discipline, and consistently learning, you can achieve success. Embrace the journey, apply these insights, and watch your confidence soar.

What should I do?,"Hi, so I'm in a bit of a dilemma here and really don't want to come off as a creep, I also plan on deleting this account after this is resolved. Also I'm going to add as much possible context as I can so I don't come off as some psycho stalking some poor innocent dude trying to do his job, my bad if I overexplain or am a bit too descriptive.

I (18F) met a guy at this coffee shop (a friend had introduced me to it a couple of weeks before) near my university, I had went one Friday after my lab and he had complimented my top I was wearing that day. Honestly, I was pretty flattered and thought he looked cute, I had wanted to see him more but didn't know if he even worked any other time other than late afternoon/early evening on Friday (3pm to 6pm, when they close) as he looked young enough to be a college student. So, I returned that next Friday at around 5:30PM, and lo and behold, I saw him behind the pastry shelf standing near a lady at the cash register. 

One thing that stuck out to me was the fact that while the lady was initially at the register as I walked in, the guy had went up to the lady and switched places with her as I was about to walk up to order. Furthermore, his body language seemed pretty friendly and he was smiling at me, but that could also definitely be a hospitality in food service thing. So, I finish ordering and he asks me for my name (which is standard for that coffee shop), and then I wait for my order and right as I'm about to leave, I decide to ask him about last week. He confirms it and I  actually managed to get his name as well lol. I tell him I'll see him around and then when I walk out of the cafe, I'm a bit of a giggly mess.

What's really tripping me up though is that this really isn't a normal context for me to be getting to know him. This literally feels like one of those Hallmark movies in the making. However, the only way I can actually get to know him more outside of this is if I ask for his number, but that also feels weird and I just really want to avoid making him uncomfortable. If that means I won't be able to get to know him and should just let this go, then I'll let it go before I get too hooked on this. I could also just keep going to the coffee shop and see if anything else speaks out to me before acting on anything as well. What should I do with all of this?",1,1729474630.0,Advice,2,0.99,False

1g8eh2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1g8eh2w/aio_about_husband_wanting_to_sell_recently/,AIO about husband wanting to sell recently purchased vehicle,"
In March of this year, my husband and I decided that it was time to buy a new vehicle. Our eldest teenage son struggles to fit comfortably in the small hatchback (that we call my car) and the duel cab Ute was aging (his car). 

We began looking around at cars, with the expectation that we would sell both cars and get one good family car. 
Ute was worth 20k
Hatch back 5k

12 months ago I had cancer and I was still too scared to finance a vehicle in case I have a recurrence, and need more time off work. We currently have no car loans and the pressure of having debt while unable to work stressed me out.

While looking I did see some cars I could potentially see us buying, but they were not suitable in my husbands eyes because it HAD to have a towbar for the trailer. This requirement reduced the selection of cars in our 25-30k budget to what seemed the same as we already had, or worse, at least I know our cars are reliable, serviced ect. 
So I though we decided I’d just keep my car for now. He would sell his and then we will wait until we have more money or something suitable comes up.

His car sold pretty quickly and so did the next development in the car saga. My husband had a car yard from interstate FaceTime him to show him a  Ford Ranger Raptor. I looked at the very shiny, impressive, big black truck on FaceTime with him and I could tell he loved it. He talked about family trips, coffee dates, the great deal it was and that he wanted to get it.
I smiled and supported him. Yes we can afford it, no I didn’t *really* want a car loan, but I could see how it would be good. He loves cars, and this is something he wanted. So I gave him what I could from my own savings, plus the money from the sale of his car and he took out vehicle finance for the rest.

The car being sent from interstate was extremely stressful as at one point the dealership didn’t know where it was and the courier sub contracted the delivery and they lost track of the vehicle too. 
Then when we got it and went to register the vehicle it didn’t pass the road safety pit check because of a loose differential (from memory I don’t know lots about cars) 
Because it was still under factory warranty this was fixed by a ford dealership but it was so stressful that we had potentially brought one very expensive lemon on finance.
In the end it all worked out.

Now I’m used to driving a small hatchback, it was a BIG jump to suddenly drive a Ford ranger raptor. This raptor didn’t even feel like it would fit in the car parks to me 😅
But I pushed myself to be brave and learn to park and drive this monster truck in the city when I needed to take the children and not just use my little car.

Fast forward now to October, where one Sunday afternoon my husband comes inside after washing the car very irritated. 
“I’m pissed off, and going to sell the raptor” is all he said. Irritation bursting from him.

This made me SO ANGRY. I went to lay down  furious that he just will sell it after all the emotional effort it took on my part to get this car for him more than us. That I supported his want knowing cars mean more to him than me. 

I told him all of this, that I feel angry because I had to emotionally invest so much in supporting him get this car and he is just going to feel pissed off and sell it. Just like that. Fuck is all. Is what it feels like.

When we looked for a family car originally, the budget was small, when he looked for a family car that also scratched his love of cars, there was no budget. That’s hurtful too. 

His defence is that he is pissed off because it’s now warming up and the Ute doesn’t fit in our garage. (He knew this before buying the Raptor) The the intentions to get a carport built have been on hold until the power line to our house is moved which needed an engendered part? That the company moving it have gone ages organising. So it’s all at a standstill and I have made comments about a flat pack carport being ugly (but I haven’t said not to build it, just I don’t think it will look the best). 
So he just sees this expensive car sitting in the hot Australian sun all day now getting fried. 

He feels my strong reaction is me just not wanting him to be happy. And fine he will just keep the car. 

I have really struggled to let go of this frustration, I don’t even want to drive the Ute anymore. Maybe I should just revisit the topic and say sell it because I honestly don’t even want to look at the Ute now.

1g8edc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1g8edc1/27_m_finally_healing_from_chronic_gastritis/,27 M Finally Healing From Chronic Gastritis,"After over a year of being diagnosed with gastritis, I finally can say I am doing soooo much better and am finally starting to eat things I wasn't able to eat before.

This all happened in August of last year when all of a sudden I got stomach cramps, bloating, heartburn, phlegm in my throat, food feeling like it's stuck in my throat, tension headaches, diarrhea, and constipation. After seeing a GI doctor and going through a endoscopy AND a colonoscopy, I was diagnosed with a mild form of chronic gastritis. The doctor didn't know what exactly caused it, but assumed it was either stress or COVID. I was on PPI (Omeprazole on the highest dose they prescribe) for over 6 months. I couldn't do any other meds to calm my stomach due to the meds I take except tums. I saw a dietician who, due to my existing problems with IBS before gastritis, put me on a low fat and low fiber diet. Breakfast was bland rice Krispies or Rice Chex cereal, a plain or blueberry bagel, and fat free Greek yogurt. Lunch was a turkey and 2% or fat free cheese sandwich. Dinner was bland chicken with salt and pepper (sometimes I added turmeric), green beans, and white rice with turmeric. I had to stop drinking soda and only drink water, lemonade, or decaf tea.

If I was going out to eat, I'd only go to Chick Fil A or chipotle. For Chick Fil A my meal is a grilled sandwich on an unbuttered bun with no tomato and honey mustard. For Chipotle, I always ordered through the app the quesadillas with carnitas. As I got better I was able to eat it with sour cream, white rice, and half of the pinto beans they give you. Also, for some reason I was able to eat chicken nuggets from McDonald's (as long as they are bland and not too many of them) as well as (most) chicken tenders.

To get off the PPI, I stepped down 20mg every 3 weeks and on the first week of stepping down, I would take that dose every other day for that week to avoid rebound acid. When I started doing it, I replaced the PPI with a 40mg dose of pepcid. Now I am completely off the PPI for over 3 months now and have FINALLY been able to drink coffee after not being able to have it for the longest time. I am now starting to lean more towards higher fat foods, yet making sure they are low in saturated fat (as my dietician said that's bad). I am slowly going towards more fiber, but being cautious as that triggers my IBS. Recently I have started being able to eat a bit of chocolate, which has made me feel like the end is just around the corner.

My advice for people is to LISTEN to your gut. If I start feeling symptoms, I immediately go for tums to calm my stomach down and stop eating what I was eating. This has so far prevented me from flaring up. If things get worse, I go back to the bland diet for a few days and then put things back.",3,1729473986.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1g8e9lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/improv/comments/1g8e9lo/extremely_fucked_up_improv_class/,Extremely fucked up improv class,"I really didn’t want to end up making a post like this. I just wanted to have a fun improv class. But the way my fellow improvisers and I have been treated is absolutely not okay and has veered into straight up abuse. This guy has no business teaching improv anywhere or being in charge of anything. I wouldn’t even trust him alone with a chicken for five minutes. I would describe his teaching style as being like if J.K. Simmons from Whiplash was an uncharismatic perverted weasel. Every. Single. Thing. You. Do. Is. Wrong. He makes fun of people’s accents, he makes fun of people’s clothes, he makes fun of what he thinks people’s childhoods were like (?), he tells people they “seem like weird incels,” he constantly says that he thinks you’re secretly a bad person who’s only pretending to be nice on the surface and acts like he knows some deep dark secret about you that no one else knows. Just whatever he can do to try to get under your skin and chip away at your self confidence. Then when people become quieter and less confident he says shit like “Lack of confidence comes from a place of ego. If you’re unsure in a scene it’s because you don’t respect your scene partner and only care about yourself.” He’ll make people do bizarre, borderline humiliating exercises with elaborate instructions, people will follow them to T, and he’ll go “You did it wrong.” Then he’ll make them do it over and over until it’s “Right”. When people ask him to clarify what they’re supposed to do, he’ll describe exactly what the person is doing. When the person asks “How is that different from what I did?” He’ll say something like “It’s a feeling. The way you did it wasn’t emotionally honest because you were scared.” In our last class, we did an exercise where every time he clapped we were supposed to heighten our behavior and actions, which is an exercise I’ve done before, but this guy would not stop clapping and refused to call the scenes until every scene heightened to the point of everyone cornering each other into the ground, pretending to rape or murder each other, or nearly actually physically assaulting each other. He instructs us to sit on each other’s laps, grab onto each other’s hips, stand nose to nose and start touching each other, and lie on the floor and “spoon” with one of the only two women in the class (then when the big spoon male improviser provides a respectful distance he makes fun of them for not knowing how to spoon properly). In an object work exercise, he told all the male improvisers to do stuff like “make a sandwich” or “prepare coffee” but when it was the younger of the two women in the class’s turn, he instructed her to “get undressed.” He had her do a full two minutes (with a timer) of standing alone on stage and miming getting undressed. And when she was done he grilled her on whether or not she took off her underwear. Then he had her do it several more times over the course of about 30 minutes. Again, the guys just got to do shit like make sandwiches. And when she was done he said he could tell by the way she moved through her closet that she was “a spoiled little rich girl.” Then he had the nerve to make fun of a student and call them sexist for wearing a shirt with the Playboy logo on it and said “I can’t believe your wearing THOSE fucking pants and the shirt is what’s wrong with your outfit.” He had a whole running gag the other day where he just said shitty things about students appearances (“Your hair looks like you tied a bunch of balloons to it.”) but then he’d follow it up with “…In a good way!” I can’t remember all the shitty things he said to everyone but he did it like five times and it was all mean spirited and never funny. Each class just keeps getting meaner and more mind fucky. It feels like we’re in a boiling frog experiment and no one wants to be the first annoying frog to admit that the water’s getting pretty hot. The whole thing is like a bizarre form of psychological torture. It’s the kind of stuff documentaries are made about 30 years in the future after all the participants have gone clinically insane or died. When it comes to basic scenework, if someone makes a strong or interesting choice he’ll say it didn’t work or it made the scene too much about that thing. But when the same improvisers come back out and make less strong choices he’ll go “That scene really floundered and you didn’t seem like you knew what to do.” He’s also began encouraging all the students to not only give each other notes on scenes, but give each other really harsh and negative notes (“Your acting wasn’t good, so it didn’t sell the scene,” etc). It’s such a bizarrely toxic environment and whenever I leave and go somewhere else afterward, I’m flabbergasted at how nice and normal everyone in the real world is to each other. It feels like I’ve entered a different dimension where everything isn’t made out of abuse. I’m a full grown man and I started to cry after the last class when the door guy at a nearby bar told me “Thanks!” in a friendly way because I showed him my ID. We’ve had five classes that have been three hours each, so it’s been fifteen hours total of being stuck in a small, windowless room with this shit. I’ve really only barely scratched the surface of describing this experience with this post. I’ve taken improv classes for ten years and I’ve never seen anything like this. I’ve honestly never been treated with this much disrespect in my life. I wrote for the CBS Diversity Showcase in 2015, which is somewhat infamous for being a toxic environment (https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/cbs-diversity-showcase-racist-sexist-homophobic-mess-participants-say.html), but that pales in comparison to what this has been like. Anyway, it feels immoral at this point to protect this asshole’s identity, so his name is Rich Sohn and he teaches at The Pack Theater. Do not take his class. Or any class at The Pack, because I don’t think anyone should go near a theater that allows this kind of shit to go on. I can’t imagine anything even remotely close to this happening at a theater like UCB because at least there’s some oversight there, which there clearly isn’t at The Pack.",22,1729473637.0,improv,30,0.79,False

There’s this girl i’ve always liked, call her R, and i’ve always been interested in her since freshman year, but because she’s always been a grade above me, i thought that it was impossible cuz what girl is gonna date someone in the year below them. We’ve talked a few times and i’ve had her in at least one class every year, we’ve talked a few times, mostly the occasional hi and hellos but there was a few times where we actually had full on conversations and in those convos I realized that she was such an amazing and sweet fucking person.

Well when I went to homecoming that night, I was really well dressed and was pretty confident in myself, so even though i’m awkward as fuck, i saw her there and decided to strike up a conversation, the thing is she was always with her friends so it was hard to actually talk to her without taking her away from her friends, and the first conversation i wasn’t planning on asking her to dance, just mostly admiring how pretty she was that night.

Well once the first slow song started, I decided that if i could find her once i slow dance started, i’d ask her to dance but instead of asking her to dance, i just said she looked really pretty and walked off cuz i’m awkward as fuck. Thankfully once the last slow dance started i actually gained balls for once and i actually did ask her and i’m so proud of myself for that. During the dance we kinda bonded about awkwardness and mostly talked about school stuff and that i thought that she looked really good tonight and We even talked a bit afterwards and I got her instagram.

Now, this is the first time I knew from the start that I wanted a relationship with a girl, mostly i’d danced and talked to girls before, but i never really had that deep of a connection. This would be my first relationship and (i’m pretty sure) hers too. Now it’s the afternoon after and i know from past conversations that she likes coffee, anime, and thrifting but I actually want this to work, so how could i start the conversation on insta without being totally awkward and giving off weird vibes? I have an idea in my head but I want us to have a solid ground of friendship and that we’re actually compatible before getting into anything flirty/risky wise. I’m shy and would say i’m a really kind person and i’d say she’s the exact same. Thanks for all the help guys!

Cute girl came up to say hi to the person we both knew and she couldn't look at me.  She's very calm.   When we pass by each other, she averts her eyes from me.  There was a time we got close at the counter and she didn't look at me.  After that I had a very difficult time making simple contact with her. I'd say hi to her but would be looking at my coffee.

Hello there! I'm a kind, reliable guy looking for a genuine woman who values open communication and shared experiences. I believe in treating others with respect and kindness, and I'm interested in building a relationship based on mutual understanding and support.

At my core, I'm a caring, down-to-earth guy who believes in old-fashioned chivalry. I was raised to be a gentleman - to open doors, pull out chairs, and offer my arm. But I also recognize the importance of modern gender equality, and I'm eager to build a relationship founded on teamwork and collaboration.

I take pride in being a reliable, trustworthy companion. You can count on me to be there for you through life's ups and downs. I'm a great listener and I'll make the time to understand your hopes, dreams, and concerns. In return, I hope you'll feel comfortable opening up to me as well!

When it comes to dating, I prefer to keep things simple and thoughtful. I enjoy planning unique, memorable outings that allow us to connect and learn more about each other. Perhaps we'll start with drinks at a cozy local cocktail lounge or grab coffee at the local coffee shop,  then chase the city lights while we drive around blasting our favorite songs and watching the sun set in the horizon. Or maybe we'll pack a picnic and go for a hike in the countryside, breathing in the fresh air and taking in the natural beauty around us. Added bonus if you are 420 friendly! The specifics aren't as important as being present in the moment and creating shared experiences.

If you are looking for the stats I'm 27 male, manager at retail and career driven guy who is emotionally intelligent and knows what I want and what I dont. I was born and raised in the Sultanate of Oman  and have been around people from different race and culture. Originally from India.

If this approach resonates with you, I'd be honored to take you on a date and get to know you better. I'm looking for a partner who is kind, curious, and caring - someone who will appreciate my efforts to be a considerate, thoughtful companion. If that sounds like you, please don't hesitate to reach out. I can't wait to meet you! ☺️

I’m about to put it all in fidelity’s SP500 index and just let it be there for the next 2 decades with monthly contributions of about 2000 or so after reading content I found by chance from this group, that fits nicely with my risk aversion type of personality. 
Family is pushing me to hire a financial advisor but I have nothing to be advised, except those 50k and real assets like my home and car.

Happily made fun of a play with Lorelai and her friends, a play that was his idea to see. His sense of humor matched hers.

Hours later, a Vegan Market set up in that exact same spot.

I went for a walk and saw a homeless guy in the middle of the sidewalk with a cart full of trash, passed out in his own vomit 10 feet from a coffee shop.

Then I heard a screamer from the max, shouting profanity (that one is fairly normal).

Then I finally decided it was time to call 911, to report a half-naked lady (waist-down) sitting on the Max rails. She eventually got up, bent over, and was presumably fishing a tampon out of her vagina. I reported the vomit guy at the same time. I left for 4 hours, and vomit-guy was still there when I got back.

1g8dukq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreativeQuill/comments/1g8dukq/the_final_passage_chapter_2/,The Final Passage - Chapter 2,"The morning sun was just starting to rise as Daniel pulled the covers around his shoulders. He was still half-asleep, his mind heavy with the remnants of strange dreams. He couldn’t quite remember the details, but they had woken him up a few times in the middle of the night. And in his not fully alert state, he could swear he heard what sounded like whispers. That must’ve been a dream too, because as Daniel reflected on it, it seemed silly. “It’s just an old house,” he told himself.

His eyes strained against the early light streaming through the windows. *It looks like it’s going to rain*, he thought. He could've sworn the weather report had said it would be in the seventies and sunny today. Frowning, he rubbed his hands together, trying to shake the cold that seemed to have settled into the bones of the house.

It wasn’t just chilly. It was freezing.

Daniel got out of bed, his feet recoiling as they hit the cold wooden floor. He shuffled over to Lucas’s room and peeked in through the cracked-open door. He could see the top of his son’s head, the rest of him bundled snugly under his blankets. For a moment, Daniel stood there and watched him, hopeful for their future for the first time in months.

A shiver ran down his spine, and he hugged himself, trying to warm up. *I’ll have to make sure the furnace is working today*, he thought. It’s an old house, so there probably isn’t much insulation. But there was something unusual about this cold feeling—it didn’t seem like the kind of chill that came from a draft or faulty heating. It felt more invasive, like the cold was pressing into every corner of the house, surrounding him.

“Dad, hurry up! I want to see the school!” Max’s voice echoed from downstairs, full of excitement. He was already charging toward the front door, his shoes only half-tied.

“Hold on, buddy. I’ve got to get your brother ready to go.”

Lucas was struggling to tie his shoelaces. “Stop, Dad, I know how to do it,” he said with determination, pulling his untied shoe away and finishing the knot himself.

Daniel smiled. *He’s growing up so fast*.

Once Lucas was ready, the boys raced toward the car. It was time to explore the town of Prosperity. Daniel had been meaning to get them out of the house for a while—to grab some groceries, maybe find a nice spot for breakfast. And with the fresh start they were hoping for, today seemed as good a day as any to get acquainted with the town.

“Dad, are you coming?” Max called from the car, bouncing in the passenger seat.

Daniel stumbled through the door, hoping there was a diner in town that had good strong coffee. As he turned the key in the ignition, the heater sputtered and groaned before kicking in. He shot a glance at the boys. Lucas was wrapped in his coat, staring out the window, while Max was practically vibrating with energy.

The town of Prosperity appeared peaceful and quiet as they approached, the kind of sleepy little place where nothing big seemed to happen. The main street was lined with a handful of quaint shops, and a few cars were parked in front of a diner and grocery store. But Daniel couldn’t shake the strange sensation in the air—the cold seemed to extend beyond just the house, as if it had settled over the entire town.

Daniel noticed a small crowd gathered by the old, abandoned train station at the edge of town.

“What’s going on over there?” Max asked, his curiosity piqued.

“I’m not sure,” Daniel said. “Let’s check it out.”

Daniel guided the car towards the small cluster of vehicles parked haphazardly near the dilapidated train station. The rusted metal and peeling paint of the station's facade stood in stark contrast to the gleaming locomotive that sat on the tracks, its polished brass fittings catching the weak morning light.

""Whoa,"" Lucas breathed, his nose pressed against the window. ""Is that a real train?""

As they drew closer, Daniel felt a chill run down his spine that had nothing to do with the unseasonable cold. The train seemed to shimmer slightly, as if it wasn't quite solid. Its edges blurred when he tried to focus on them, and the deep black paint of the engine seemed to absorb the light around it.

Max was already unbuckling his seatbelt before Daniel had fully stopped the car. ""Can we go look? Please, Dad?""

Daniel hesitated, rolling down his window. “Hold on boys.” He stated, his eyes fixated on the train.

He stopped the car near a middle-aged couple sitting on some lawn chairs. “Hi,” he called out to them, “what’s going on?”

The man glanced briefly behind him, then right back at the train. “Train full of ghosts.”

Daniel looked again at the train, “What do you mean a train full of ghosts.”

“Exactly what I said. It’s a train full of ghosts. Go check it out fer yourself. Don’t get too close though, it makes you feel kinda funny and fuzzy if you get too close.”

“Dad, what’s he talking about.” Lucas asked. Daniel sensed the uneasiness in his voice. Hell, Daniel was feeling plenty uneasy himself.

“Let’s go check it out!” Max was reaching for the door handle, the curious and adventurous boy that he was.

“Stop. Stay in the car.” Looking back at the man in the lawn chair, “What’s it doing? Is it safe?”

“It ain’t doing anything. Just sitting there.” Daniel could hear the impatience in the man’s voice. The man turned to face them and squinted at their car. “Yer new, I don’t recognize you.”

“Yeah, just came in last night. I’m Daniel, and these are my sons. Max and Lucas. James Thompson was my uncle.”

The look in the man’s face turned from annoyed to compassionate. “Ol’ Jimmy. He was a good one. I’m sorry for your loss. The name is Pat, and this big ol’ gal here is my wife, Betty.” Betty gave Pat a disapproving look and shook her head when she heard that.

“Hi Pat and Betty. Yeah, thanks. So, what exactly is going on here? What do you mean a ghost train?”

“I suppose Jimmy never told you about it, then? It ain’t the first time it’s been here. Some of the older folks have seen it here once before, ‘bout 50 or so years ago. They tell tales and basically worship the dang thing. Before it got here, our lovely town was dying. No one could get a crop to grow. Then one night, the train pulls up. It’s here for a day or so, then just leaves. After it left, we can’t keep up with the crops.”

Daniel's eyes narrowed as he studied the train a few hundred feet in front of them more closely. The locomotive seemed to defy reality, its form shifting and undulating like a mirage in the desert. The black paint was so deep and rich that it appeared to swallow the weak morning light, creating an aura of darkness around the train. Steam hissed from unseen vents, curling and twisting in impossible patterns before dissipating into the frigid air.

As he squinted, trying to make out more details, Daniel noticed something peculiar about the front car. There, barely visible against the inky blackness, he could just make out a name etched in flowing, ornate script: Archon. The letters seemed to shimmer and dance, as if they were alive, pulsing with an otherworldly energy that made Daniel's head swim.

The train's windows were opaque, like smoky quartz, revealing little at this distance what may lie inside of it. But it looked like there were people in it, moving around. He didn’t want to take his eyes off of it.

“Dad, let’s go look!” Max said excitedly. Daniel snapped out of it, looking back at the boys. Max was wide eyed, staring at the train with a smile. Lucas looked cautious and nervous in comparison, looking at his dad instead. Out of the corner of his eye, Daniel saw a small diner across the street with a few people in it sitting at the counter.

“Not right now, let’s get something to eat first.” He turned to look at the train again, then at the dozens of townspeople standing around like it was a small party, celebrating the return of the ghost train or whatever it was. He was amazed at how casual everyone was being.

“Aww come on dad,” Max whined from the backseat.

“No. We’re going to eat.” He unbuckled, then opened his door. Looking back at Pat, he asked “Why is it so cold?”

Pat looked at him, shrugged his shoulders and gestured towards the train, implying the train was the cause of the drop of temperature.

“Ok Max, hold Lucas’s hand when we cross.” Daniel looked both ways and so did Max. “Okay, let’s go.”

Daniel ushered his boys across the street, their shoes scuffing against the cracked asphalt. The diner's neon sign flickered weakly in the gray morning light, its cheery ""OPEN"" a stark contrast to the eerie atmosphere that seemed to blanket the town. A bell jingled as they pushed through the door, the warm aroma of coffee and bacon momentarily chasing away the chill that clung to their bones.

""Sit anywhere you like, folks,"" called a plump waitress from behind the counter, her smile faltering slightly as she caught sight of the newcomers.

They slid into a worn vinyl booth, Lucas pressing himself against the wall, his eyes fixed resolutely on the tabletop. Max, on the other hand, craned his neck to peer out the window at the ghostly locomotive.

""Dad, can you see inside it from here?"" Max whispered.

“Sure can. Been a busy mornin’ cause of it, too.” the waitress said as she slid menus onto our table. “Can I get ya some drinks to start? “

“Coffee, please. And two chocolate milks for them.”

The waitress, her nametag said Deanna, must’ve noticed the uneasiness in Lucas. “Hey little man, nothing to worry about. Sure, it sounds creepy if you ain’t from around here. But if you grew up here like I did, you’d know. That there train is actually a good sign. It brought a lot of good stuff to us here. My mama used to tell me the story of it the first time it showed up. Nobody here had a pot to piss in. Then one night, it showed up. And brought the cold I’m sure you fellas have felt with it. The day after it left, the corn started to grow. The cows gave more milk. The chickens got fatter and laid more eggs, biggest you’d ever seen. One scrambled egg here is two in any other place.”

Lucas glanced at her, then back at the table.

I want a scrambled egg then!” Max exclaimed.

“Sure thing, honey. The rest of ya’ll know what you want, too?

Daniel ordered for himself and Lucas, his mind still reeling from the waitress's casual explanation of the ghostly train. As Deanna jotted down their orders and bustled away, he found his gaze drawn back to the window, where the Archon loomed in the distance like a dark promise.

""Dad,"" Lucas whispered, tugging at his sleeve. ""I don't like it here. Can we go home?""

Daniel patted his son's hand reassuringly, even as a knot of unease tightened in his own stomach. ""It's okay, buddy. We're just getting some breakfast, then we'll head back.""

Max, however, was practically bouncing in his seat. ""But Dad, we have to go see the train up close! What if it leaves before we get a chance?""

""We'll see,"" Daniel murmured, noncommittally. He couldn't shake the feeling that there was something deeply wrong about the situation. The casual acceptance of the townsfolk, the inexplicable cold, and the train itself - it all felt like a fever dream he couldn't wake up from.

Deanna returned with their food, setting down plates heaped with eggs, bacon, and toast. True to her word, the eggs were enormous, their yellow yolks gleaming unnaturally bright against the white ceramic.

""Enjoy, folks,"" she said with a wink, before hurrying off to tend to the growing crowd of customers.

Max dug in eagerly, but Lucas just pushed his food around his plate, his eyes darting nervously between the window and his father. Daniel forced himself to eat, trying to avert his focus from the train. His curiosity almost consuming him, he had to keep reminding himself not to be stupid. He had Max and Lucas with him.

Daniel paid the bill, leaving a generous tip for Deanna, and ushered the boys out of the diner. The cold hit them like a physical force as they stepped outside, the warmth of the meal quickly dissipating in the unnaturally frigid air.

""Alright, boys, back to the car,"" Daniel said, his voice tight with barely concealed tension.

Max's face fell. ""But Dad, we haven't seen the train up close yet!""

""I know, buddy, but—"" Daniel paused, torn between his parental instincts and his own burning curiosity. ""Tell you what, you two get in the car and wait for me. I'm going to take a quick look, okay?""

Lucas nodded vigorously, relief evident in his eyes as he climbed into the backseat. Max, however, pouted but complied, shooting longing glances at the train a few hundred feet away.

Daniel glanced over at Pat and Betty, still sitting in their chairs chatting with another couple sprawled on a picnic blanket nearby.

“Hey Pat, how close can I get?”

Pat looked over at Daniel with a smirk, “As close as you want to. Like I said, closer you get it makes you feel kinda funny inside.”

Daniel took a deep breath, steeling himself against the biting cold as he began to inch his way towards the ghostly locomotive. Each step felt like wading through molasses, the air growing thicker and more resistant as he approached. The chill intensified with every foot he gained, seeping into his bones and making his teeth chatter uncontrollably.

As he drew closer, the train's presence became almost palpable. An otherworldly energy seemed to radiate from its sleek, black surface, pulsing in waves that made Daniel's skin prickle and his hair stand on end. The sensation was unlike anything he had ever experienced before—it was as if the very fabric of reality was warping around the locomotive, bending the laws of nature to its will.

The cold intensified, burrowing deeper into his marrow with each labored step. Daniel's breath came out in thick, white wisps like a cold winter day.

Daniel's heart pounded in his chest as he inched closer to the train, his eyes fixed on the opaque windows. The smoky quartz surface seemed to ripple and shift, like the surface of a dark, still pond disturbed by an unseen force. As he squinted, trying to penetrate the gloom, the glass began to clear ever so slightly, revealing shadowy forms moving within.

At first, they were just vague silhouettes, dark smudges against the murky interior. But as Daniel forced himself to take another step forward, ignoring the bone-deep chill that threatened to freeze him in place, the shapes began to coalesce into something more recognizable.

Faces. Dozens of them, pressed against the glass, their features becoming clearer with each passing second. Daniel's breath caught in his throat as he realized he could make out individual details - sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, and mouths frozen in silent screams. The faces were a ghastly parade of anguish and despair, each one more horrifying than the last.

His heart hammered against his ribs as he recognized one face among the ghostly throng - a face he knew all too well. Uncle Jimmy stared back at him, his eyes wide with terror, his lips moving in a desperate, silent plea.

Daniel stumbled backward, his mind reeling from the impossible sight. The cold seemed to intensify, wrapping around him like icy tendrils, threatening to drag him towards the train. He could feel a pull, an inexorable force urging him to step closer, to join the ranks of the damned souls trapped within.

With a herculean effort, he tore his gaze away and took a step back, bumping into something and almost falling over. Turning around, not knowing what it was he bumped into and fearing the worst, he saw his son standing there, wide eyed and mouth gaping staring at the train.

“Dad…” Max started.

“Let’s go!” Without hesitation, Daniel grabbed his son and started walking as quickly as he could back towards their car. Lucas, was still in the backseat, staring at them through the windshield. Daniel pushed Max into the backseat and hopped into the driver seat. He couldn't get them away from there fast enough.",1,1729472274.0,CreativeQuill,0,1.0,False

[Budget $250-$500],"I would like to commission a space-view image of T'bet Dal, my custom high-fantasy world. A few notes that may make this piece challenging:

1. The planet has rings. These need to be prominent and visually striking as they are central to the lore.

2. There is also a (much smaller) shattered moon in geostationary orbit above a specific part of the map.

3. Without going too deep into lore here, the ground directly beneath the rings (essentially the equator) are blackened and lifeless.

4. I want the image to also depict the continent that most of my lore/plot will take place on.

Now, if that sounds like something you can tackle, here is a bit of the nitty-gritty.

PRICE: This will be the first image that people see when they click on my wiki. It will be up front and center, and referenced to frequently. Thus I am willing to pay about 250 USD for this piece (this can be negotiated based on experience with similar work up to $500).

TIMELINE: This is pretty loose. I would love to get it in a month, but I understand the complexity of this, so two or three months with weekly (is that reasonable?) updates would be good with me.

STYLE: Honestly, I am willing to hear out a variety of art styles. I initially was dead-set on realism, but some of the artists on here are great at other things and I don’t want to shut them down, so I am pretty style-neutral.

IMAGE DETAILS: I want this to be a 16:9 image with as high of a resolution possible.

Just so I can see which artists read all of this, please tell me what you like to add to your coffee. 

REFERENCE PICTURES: I want a bit more focus on the planet, and the moon is in a different spot, but here are a couple images of Saturn to try and give an idea of the scale [here](https://economymiddleeast.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/Xfg_b7GtigYi5mxeAzkt9w/economymiddleeast.com/2023/07/shutterstock_1677454126.jpg/w=1200,h=63) and [here](https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2023/11/01145206/saturn_moon_rings-vanish_galaxy_1medium.jpg).

The continent you will be focusing on is Iave (located in the northern hemisphere) as the primary subject. Detailed Iave continent map [here](https://i.imgur.com/25LEWz6.jpeg). 

Also on that map, you can see a circular land formation. It is above this point that the shattered moon orbits at all times. (Yes, I know that such a moon is unrealistic, but there are lore reasons)

However, I want this image to be accurate, so should the image stretch to the point another continent would be visible, I have (much rougher) world map with climate details [here](https://i.imgur.com/I56loeP.jpeg) and a map of a Robinson Projection [here](https://i.imgur.com/070HNdk.jpeg)

I look forward to working together with someone!",11,1729472230.0,HungryArtists,20,1.0,False
1g8dtq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreativeQuill/comments/1g8dtq0/the_final_passage_chapter_1/,The Final Passage - Chapter 1,"The small U-Haul trailer bounced over the railroad tracks, and Daniel winced as he heard their belongings bounce and land along with the trailer. He glanced at the mirror behind him, then to his GPS. Up just a little further and they were finally there. Max, the older at eight years old and Lucas, at six years old, were sitting quietly in the back, taking in the unfamiliar scenery through the windows with hopeful curiosity. 

It had been a long trip to Prosperity, one that Daniel really hoped would prove to be life changing for him and the boys. Since Sonya, his long-time girlfriend whom the boys had shared a special relationship with passed late last year, life had really been a struggle. Max and Lucas never really knew their mom, who had taken off shortly after Lucas was born. Daniel had long abandoned the idea of love and instead focused on being a father. Then, he met Sonya. Everything was so natural with her. She fit right in and the boys really loved her. She never tried to be a mother to them, just a friend, role model, confidant. She didn’t even have to try, she just was. 

After being diagnosed with cancer and given bleak chances, everything happened so fast. Daniel tried so hard for everyone to be the best he could, always wearing a smile on his face, cooking, cleaning. He would work all day, went to every doctor with Sonya to be there for her, and was raising his two sons. Then, one day, she was gone. It was like all the positive energy was sucked right out of him. He was still a good dad to Max and Lucas, but the smile wasn’t there anymore. Daniel spent a lot more time sleeping, or just sitting in his room while they played. It was the hardest thing he had ever had to face. It had become more difficult to do the basic things in life. Work had given him a leave of absence, but he just never showed up when it ended. He spent his small savings to pay bills, and when that ran out the notices started. Pay or else. He was behind on everything. Even the landlord was threatening to start the eviction process. 

So, on that March afternoon when the officer called him to inform him that his uncle had passed away, it was a bittersweet moment. It had taken them four days to track him down, apparently, he was the closest living relative his uncle had left. Jimmy wasn’t actually my uncle; he was my dad’s. I had gone there to visit a few times in my childhood. He had a large, beautiful restored Victorian home. Daniel remembers exploring throughout it, houses like that were always filled with the coolest hiding spots. But he hadn’t been there since he was a child, after his dad passed away while he was in college he just stopped talking to family. 

It was at that moment Daniel was given an idea. He asked the officer if he was able to take care of Jimmy’s personal affects. A long shot, sure, but surprisingly the officer agreed and gave him an address to pick up the house key. Daniel figured he would just stay there, and hopefully the estate would fall to him eventually. And if not, at least they would have a place to stay for a little bit. 

Max leaned forward in his seat. “Is the house big?” 

Daniel nodded. “It’s a pretty good size. I visited a few times when I was your age. You’re gonna love it. Lots of space to play outside, too.” 

They made the final turn onto the long driveway, and the house came into view. It was big, bigger than Daniel remembered. The house stood two stories tall, with large windows, and a sprawling front porch that ran the length of the house. The paint was peeling in places, the lawn overgrown, and the hedges desperately needed trimming, but despite the signs of neglect, it was clear the house had once been beautiful. 

Daniel parked the car and turned off the engine. The boys stared out the windows in silence for a moment. Lucas was the first to speak. 

“Dad… it looks old.” 

Daniel smiled softly. “It is old, but it’s nice, too. It just needs a little work.” He unbuckled his seatbelt and opened the door, stepping out onto the gravel driveway. The house loomed above them, casting long shadows in the fading afternoon light. Daniel could see it now—the potential. The porch needed paint, sure, but the wide steps and large columns were solid. The windows, though dirty, were intact and large enough to let in plenty of light. The place just needed some care. 

Max was already out of the car, standing next to his dad and staring at the house with wide eyes. “Can we explore inside?” 

“Yeah, we’ll go in and check it out,” Daniel said, opening the trunk to grab a couple of bags. Lucas clambered out of the car more slowly, clutching his bear tightly as he stood close to Daniel’s leg. 

They made their way up the porch steps, the wood creaking beneath their feet. Daniel fumbled with the key the police had given him and unlocked the door. It swung open with a soft groan, and the inside of the house greeted them with a musty, slightly stale smell. With the light coming in through the door, they could see all the dust swirling throughout the air. 

Max darted inside, his excitement overcoming any hesitation. “Whoa! It’s huge!” he shouted, his voice echoing slightly in the room. 

Lucas lingered by the doorway, peeking inside. “Is it safe, Dad?” 

“Of course it’s safe,” Daniel said, giving Lucas a reassuring pat on the back. “It’s just a little old, that’s all. Come on, let’s go in.” 

The entryway opened into a large living room; the wooden floors dusty but intact. Tall windows let in the last rays of sunlight, casting long shadows across the floor. The walls, though faded, still had remnants of old, elegant wallpaper, peeling slightly at the edges. In this room was a large armchair by the window, a wooden coffee table, and a bookshelf lined with old books and trinkets. Jimmy had to have been ninety years old, so a house like this was impossible for him to keep up with maintaining all by himself. But it was clear that, once upon a time, the house had been really something. 

“Check out the stairs!” Max called from across the room, running toward the large staircase that led to the second floor. 

“First dibs on my room!” Lucas said. 

“No way, I’m older.” Max replied. 

“You’re both wrong. I get first dibs. And the big one is mine.” Daniel said, unsure if they even heard him because they were racing up the stairs as soon as he started to speak. 

Daniel smiled as he dropped the bags by the doorway and surveyed the place. It was big, and though the house needed a little work, he could see the potential. This could be a home for them. A fresh start. 

He stepped further into the room, his gaze catching an old photograph sitting on the end table. It was a black-and-white picture of his great uncle, much younger, standing in front of house with 5 other people. There were x’s scrawled over 3 of their faces, Daniel felt a slight chill as he looked at the picture, scooping it up and putting it in his pocket as he heard the boys running in a nearby room. 

Shaking off the strange feeling, he turned towards the other room. “Max, Lucas, come here a second. Let’s take a look around together before you start exploring.” 

The boys joined him, and together, they walked through the house. The rooms were spacious, though mostly cluttered with old furniture and his great uncle's belongings. The kitchen was large, with outdated appliances but plenty of counter space. There were four bedrooms upstairs, all with large windows that overlooked the overgrown backyard. Lucas picked the smaller of the two, staying close to his dad, while Max eagerly claimed one of the larger rooms down the hallway. 

“We’ll get everything cleaned up,” Daniel said as they stood in the upstairs hallway. “It just needs a little work. I’ll bet this house was really beautiful when it was kept up.” 

“I like it,” Max said, grinning. “It’s like living in a mansion!” 

Daniel chuckled. “Not quite a mansion, but close enough.” 

As evening approached, they unpacked the essentials, setting up the boys’ rooms with their bedding and clothes. Daniel could already feel the exhaustion of the day creeping in, the long drive and the emotional weight of being back in this house taking their toll. 

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting the house in shadow. As night settled in, the house seemed to grow quieter, the stillness amplifying every creak and groan of the old wood. Daniel sat in the living room after putting the boys to bed, staring into the darkness outside the windows. The wind rustled the leaves outside, and he thought he heard a faint noise, like a distant whistle, but he dismissed it. 

As he climbed the stairs to bed, he couldn’t help but think of his great uncle and how strange it was to be here, in his house, after all these years. The man had lived alone for so long, with almost no contact from family. Now the house was his, along with whatever memories it held. Daniel wasn’t sure what that meant yet. 

Later that night, as Daniel lay in bed, the house was silent. The boys were asleep, and he was drifting off, the weight of the day pulling him into a deep slumber. But in the distance, through the fog of sleep, he heard it again—the faint sound of a train whistle. 

He stirred, half-awake, his mind barely registering the noise. He frowned in the darkness, but before he could fully wake, the sound faded, and exhaustion overtook him. 

The whistle was gone, and so were his thoughts. Daniel fell back asleep, unaware that the sound was more than just a distant echo of the past. ",1,1729472193.0,CreativeQuill,0,1.0,False

PRICE: This will be the first image that people see when they click on my wiki. It will be up front and center, and referenced to frequently. Thus I am willing to pay about 250 USD for this piece (this can be negotiated based on experience with similar work up to $500).

TIMELINE: This is pretty loose. I would love to get it in a month, but I understand the complexity of this, so two or three months with weekly (is that reasonable?) updates would be good with me.

STYLE: Honestly, I am willing to hear out a variety of art styles. I initially was dead-set on realism, but some of the artists on here are great at other things and I don’t want to shut them down, so I am pretty style-neutral.

IMAGE DETAILS: I want this to be a 16:9 image with as high of a resolution possible.

Just so I can see which artists read all of this, please tell me what you like to add to your coffee. 

REFERENCE PICTURES: I want a bit more focus on the planet, and the moon is in a different spot, but here are a couple images of Saturn to try and give an idea of the scale [here](https://economymiddleeast.com/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/Xfg_b7GtigYi5mxeAzkt9w/economymiddleeast.com/2023/07/shutterstock_1677454126.jpg/w=1200,h=63) and [here](https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2023/11/01145206/saturn_moon_rings-vanish_galaxy_1medium.jpg).

The continent you will be focusing on is Iave (located in the northern hemisphere) as the primary subject. Detailed Iave continent map [here](https://i.imgur.com/25LEWz6.jpeg). 

Also on that map, you can see a circular land formation. It is above this point that the shattered moon orbits at all times. (Yes, I know that such a moon is unrealistic, but there are lore reasons)

However, I want this image to be accurate, so should the image stretch to the point another continent would be visible, I have (much rougher) world map with climate details [here](https://i.imgur.com/I56loeP.jpeg) and a map of a Robinson Projection [here](https://i.imgur.com/070HNdk.jpeg)

I look forward to working together with someone!",1,1729472071.0,u_NickSparky,0,1.0,False

Nmother has a physical disability and I've been her carer for the last four years. 

For context, she doesn't need to level of care I was expected to provide. Mobility is a struggle, but not impossible. She walks with an aid (walking stick). She doesn't need personal care assistance. It's really just the big stuff she actually needs help with (lawns, floor cleaning, bedding cleaning and changing). 
She would abuse me if I didn't make her every meal, 5+ coffees a day, all her shopping, go to her GP appointments FOR her, all the household cleaning, etc. 

I had enough and I moved out (after getting her on an appropriate care package). 
I take her to physio once a week, and take her to any big appointments that it it were me I would want emotional support (medical botox injections, etc). It's more than she deserves honestly. 
I don't want to do her menial household tasks anymore, and I don't want to do things that someone that's getting paid can do instead. 
Her carers generally don't have much to do during their shifts too because she's low needs. 

When she asks me to do something that a carer can do, I say no. 
I am so proud of myself but it comes with so much guilt. 
I like helping people. I don't really say no to people. 
I know she has a disability and it's in my nature to want to try and make it as easy as possible for her but I can't give her an in to abuse me anymore. 

Today she called me asking me to go to the chemist and get a (non vital) medication for her. She said she's out of the drug today. 
I told her why didn't she tell me before she was out. 
She said she thought she had some spare. 
I told her I would do it but she has to wait until I have the time.
She got upset and hung up on me.
This is the first time she's talked to me since last week when she asked me to come over on the weekend (reserved for my partner who works weekdays. Not negotiating.).
I said no. 
She pushed me and I said she has carers who can do it. 
She said she doesn't want the carers to do it, so I asked her if she considers my time less important than theirs, if she's happy for me to spend time doing it, but not for the carers to do it. 

I just realised she has a carer in today. 
The carer should be doing the drug pick up, not me.

Dear , 
I am writing to you seeking representation for SECRETS OF THE WHITE PELICAN, a 70,000-word mystery suspense novel. 

JJ has a knack for reading people and solving murder mystery books before the big reveals. Two talents that keep her entertained throughout the day, since her wealthy controlling husband won’t let her use her hospitality degree. Now, they might help her survive her next getaway.

When JJ’s husband, Pierce, cheats with a coworker, she seizes the opportunity and blackmails him to buy her a 10-room boutique hotel. She knows he can afford it. JJ enlists the help of her 6 closest friends to evaluate The White Pelican Hotel located on a remote barrier island.

Unfortunately, a hurricane veers off path and heads straight towards them. When the island is evacuated, JJ and her group decide to hunker down in the hotel for a typical Florida hurricane party. As the storm rages, it cuts them off from the mainland. Then one of the friends is found murdered on the beach and another goes missing. Those left alive must band together until they are rescued. Once off the island they agree they can't tell the real story—so they lie. 

The friends are drawn back to the island after the discovery of a skeleton on the hotel property. The remains are identified, and the death is ruled due to natural causes. But JJ is certain the death involves foul play. She plans on doing a little sleuthing to uncover what really happened and determine if one of the friends didn’t stick to the lie. 

SECRETS OF THE WHITE PELICAN will appeal to fans of the locked room mystery, One By One by Ruth Ware. Also, for audiences that were captivated by the twists and turns of The Hunting Party by Lucy Foley. 

I currently live on Sanibel Island with my family. I have a Doctorate of Pharmacy from Nova Southeastern University, which helps me write about unfortunate drug interactions.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,


************First 300 ****

Chapter 1



JJ imagined herself as the owner of a charming beachside resort, an impossible dream since her husband controlled their finances. She swirled her dark coffee and her mind drifted to the crystal clear waters and white sand beaches. In this fantasy her husband was nowhere in sight. To make it happen, she needed a killer strategy.

Across the bistro table, Michelle sipped her frothy latte, unaware of JJ’s desires. She wondered if her best friend would help her or think she was crazy for wanting to run a hotel.


Her lips parted as she gathered her thoughts. She hoped Michelle would help her brainstorm a plan. Her foot bounced under the table, she glanced around the crowded cafe and frowned at the loud chatter and clinking of dishes.


Before she spoke, her phone buzzed and illuminated in her pocket.

JJ pulled the device out and scanned the screen.


A message from her husband: “Can’t make it tonight. Sorry. Business trip to Barbados got moved up.”


She found herself unable to type anything back. 

“Unbelievable.” She plopped her cell face down on the table and took a deep breath to calm her nerves.

“What’s wrong?” Michelle asked.


JJ slipped her cell back into her pocket with shaky hands. “Nothing new, same story.  Just got stood up for the gala tonight.” Her lips turned down. She breathed out her nostrils and shook her head.


Michelle raised an eyebrow but didn’t press further.


“It’s Pierce,” JJ took a sip of her coffee to soothe her dry throat. “He’s leaving tonight for a business trip to Barbados.”


Michelle rolled her eyes.


 “And that means with Maria.” JJ said.


JJ avoided Michelle’s gaze. She envisioned Pierce and Maria, reclined on a pristine beach with cocktails in hand. Her stomach churned and bile rose in the back of her throat.",1,1729471754.0,PubTips,2,1.0,False
