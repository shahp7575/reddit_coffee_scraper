I don’t feel so tired anymore, I ate a big meal an hour ago, a vegetable stew, turkey and some buckwheat. And then I had a cup of coconut milk and some coconut cookies which I bought at Rossmann.

Today, once again… I woke past the planned time — I was out of bed around 7:30, but I wanted to be out by 6:00, I’m an overreaching overacheiver. I stretched a bit, then had a to cup of coffee where the I had two filters break on me as I poured the water. It took me a while to get ready today. My noisy roommate was already up making phone calls — the flatmates told me that he makes money in sketchy ways and he often cons people to make a buck. He’s an event organiser or something like that, back in Azerbaijan.

Not much happened today, but I was more groggy than usual. I didn’t really want to socialse with anyone, and I tried to avoid people, as well as my flatmates.

Evening came as it usually does, it was around eight now, it was getting cooler and darker, so I put on my Ubereats bag, and went out to do some deliveries. Krakow seemed a lot more empty today, the roads were vacant, the historic center seemed less crowded than usual. The first two orders were from a Kebab shop called Arabia Kebab. There was a short line inside as I entered. One of the girls working there was handing out free tea so I took one. It was a sweet black tea, with hints of cinnamon, it was a good boost for the night. She came around again a few minutes after, so I took another cup.

The night didn’t go too well. The orders were sparse, and the distances were short.

My fourth order was a pizza place called Pizzatopia, in the center of the Jewish district. As I came around I was told it was going to be a twenty minute wait. “a twenty minutes wait? For the Bolt order?” I said suprised. “Yes we have to prepare a big order for the Pifbull concert, unfortunetly”, “oh okay, no problem… maybe I can help a bit?” I said with a smirk — the pizza girl laughed “I know how to make a good pizza, a bit of dough, some sauce and a sprinkle of cheese” — she enjoyed the bit of banter.

The shop was filled with dozen delivery guys, one was a Filipino, one Indian, one Polish, one Middle eastern, most of them were just glued to their phones, it was a sad sight. What a weird society we live in, where people’s best friend is their smartphone. Like how can you guys just sit there glued to your devices, when you could have a nice interaction with someone, I just don’t understand…

The last order of the night was again a Keban from Arabia Kebab. One day I will try one of their Kebabs, because they look ‘really’ appetizing. A new guy was working behind the bar, he was a bit nervous, maybe frustrated because another employee was on his ass about what to put and how much to put on each Kebab. You could see that the learnee wasn’t happy. “You’re making him nervous bro” I said to them, “Yeah he is man, he is… let meeee do it” said the newbie to the guy showing him, “Ah common, you need to learn” he responded. 

It was almost eleven in the night, I was sweaty, tired, and my legs were cramping. All I wanted to do was to get back home, shower up, and eat the left overs, “oh thank god for those”.",1,1750925846.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I'm curious if there's anyone here who wears a form of ear protection when grinding or steaming milk, as we all know it's quite loud.

As someone already suffering from Tinnitus, I think it might be time to invest into something I can quickly slip on when making my morning coffee.  
  
Would love to hear some thoughts and suggestions, not keen on wearing a huge pair of Ear Defenders.

1lkun7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lkun7g/i_work_on_a_space_station_and_something_is_wrong/,I work on a space station and something is wrong with the crew (Part 1),"I work on the newest space station, called ""Laika,"" after the Soviet dog that died on a rocket. At first, I liked the name and the idea of immortalizing the poor animal, but now I think it's kind of prophetic. 

The mission started two months ago, and at first, everything seemed normal. We are a team of experienced astronauts from different nations — ten men and five women. Our station is bigger and higher up than the ISS, so it can hold more people. We are supposed to stay on the station for five years — longer than anyone ever has. NASA, working with a few other countries, wants to see how well human bodies can adapt to space conditions for long periods of time. One day, our research might help with missions to other planets or perhaps even colonization. This is the official purpose of our mission. There’s another task we were given, which is a bit more secretive. The station is equipped with newer, stronger technology that can send and receive signals from space. They still hope to hear from faraway civilizations. 

We all got to know each other before the mission and spent months training together. All of us had been on the ISS before, so the adaptation process seemed simple. There was a lot of work, like maintenance and daily reports back to Earth, but overall, our life was simple, almost peaceful. 

Everything changed on a random Friday of the third week. I was working with the “Long-Distance Communication Array,” which we jokingly called “Ray.” I was in the room with Greg Swanson, a 45-year-old American engineer who was the most skeptical about the existence of extraterrestrial life. He had spent his entire life working for NASA and believed that if aliens did, in fact, exist, we would have already known about them. But he was the best in his field, and the pay was good, so he agreed to go on the mission. All the money was being sent to his wife and four children. Usually we ran all the waves we received through sonification process. We were listening to the usual silence through “Ray” until… 

BOOM 

The sound was so loud I had to cover my ears. I felt like the echoes were bouncing inside my brain, causing a strong headache. Greg and I stared at each other in disbelief for a few seconds, then went back to “Ray.” Humans had received what they thought were signals from outer space civilisations before, but soon we learned that those were stars exploding or black holes expanding. This sound was something entirely different. It wasn’t like any signal we had received before — the system couldn’t even tell its frequency.

We called our teammates. It didn’t matter what they were doing — they all stopped midway and joined us in the Signal Room. Nothing was more important than this. We saved the recording and sent it back to Earth as soon as we could. Whatever it was, it could be the biggest discovery of our century. We could come back as heroes. But honestly, I couldn’t care less about that. We might be the first people ever to come in contact with extraterrestrial life. That thought sent shivers down my spine. 

We spent the evening celebrating. There’s no alcohol on the station, but the excitement everyone shared made me feel drunk. We kept talking and laughing and coming up with potential explanations of what the signal might be. There was a feeling of victory and almost childlike curiosity about the unknown. Now both we and the scientists back on Earth had a tough job of trying to decipher the signal.

Our team had three Signal Processing Specialists — 33-year-old Maria Smirnova from Russia, 40-year-old Oliver Allen from the UK, and 25-year-old Mia Gonzales from the US. Mia was the youngest on our team, yet extremely intelligent. All three had experience in analyzing signals from outer space and the deep ocean, yet none of them had any idea what ours meant.

“When we receive signals from a giant star, for example, we can tell almost everything”, Maria explained to me as we were having lunch in the cafeteria block. “We can tell how far away it is, what is happening, and when it happened. This is something completely different. Our computers have no idea. When I'm listening to it, it's like I feel vibrations in my entire body”.

Two weeks went by, and nothing really happened since. There were no more signals that “Ray” could detect, and the team still had no idea what ours could mean or where it could have come from. We were trying our best, but the excitement was slowly dying down. It still felt normal, but not as peaceful as before. Something was changing on the station, and I could feel it. 

One day, I was working with Chen in the control room. He was a 32-year-old Chinese engineer with a kind smile and a quirky sense of humor. The guy was never serious, and if you met him in a bar, you'd think he was an unemployed party animal still living with his parents, but the man was a genius.

We were doing a routine check of life support systems when suddenly I felt a piercing sharp pain in my forehead. It felt like someone put a giant needle through my brain, and now it was about to explode. Everything inside my head was hot and pulsating. I couldn’t sit straight and instinctively put my hand to my head. 

“Are you okay?” Chen’s voice sounded like he was talking from a different dimension. Everything went blurry for a second, and then I managed to focus my eyes. 

“Yes… No… I mean,” the words wouldn’t come out of my mouth. “I don’t know. I just had such a strong headache. I think it’s getting better.” 

“You wanna go to the doctor’s block?” 

“No, it’s… it’s fine.” I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it.

Chen brought me some water. The headache went away as quickly as it started, so we went back to the life support systems. Chen was my favorite person to work with. He always made me laugh and never acted like the smartest person in the room, even though he probably was one. 

I tried not to think much about the incident, but it still bothered me. I’ve never experienced migraines, but my mom did. I remember her lying down on the couch with her palm to her forehead, and my dad would bring her painkillers. She used to take a lot of them, otherwise, she couldn’t even focus. Sometimes she would skip work because of migraines, and one day she couldn’t come to my school play. I was hurt, so dad had to explain to me what a migraine was. As for me, though, I’ve never had them. I was always a healthy and athletic child, which eventually helped me get into a space program. I valued my health, and now this? I began to worry that my mom’s genetics had kicked in because of my age or long space missions. I really hoped it wasn’t the case, and well, I soon learned it wasn’t.

There were two doctors on board, and they were working overtime. Every day, several people would come to complain about headaches. It would be normal if one or two astronauts had this problem, but all of us? A bunch of experienced space travelers? Helen, the doctor from the US, tried her best to help us with pills and breathing exercises, but the results were always temporary. Her Russian colleague, Igor, was freaking out. They couldn’t figure out what was causing the headaches. The doctors measured our body temperature and blood pressure. We even went through the CT scanners we had on the station. Nothing was out of the ordinary. 

By the next week, it wasn’t just headaches. I couldn’t fall asleep no matter how hard I tried. I would lay down in bed with nothing but thoughts that wouldn’t stop. I wanted to shout at my own brain, “SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP!” When I did fall asleep, it was only for a few hours. I would wake up even more tired than before. Everyone was going through it, and we couldn’t ignore it. It was only our 6th week, and we were not the type of people to crack inside a fully equipped station. None of us had even left “Laika” once. Something was wrong. We assumed it was the oxygen tanks or the food and water supply. That was our best guess; all the other systems on board were perfectly normal. In space, it’s usual to have some sort of problem with engines or control blocks, but there weren’t any. Everything worked like clockwork, yet we all felt miserable. We took turns checking the equipment on a daily basis, ran lab tests on our food supply, but still, there was no answer. The doctors sent our health reports back to Earth for analysis and anxiously waited for a response. We tried our best to stay positive, but it was hard.

One day, I think it was a Thursday, I went to the cafeteria by myself. Everyone else was either working or desperately trying to finally fall asleep. As I got closer to the entrance, I heard voices. It was Greg, the American engineer, and his countrymen Michael and Jessica, both programmers.

“They’re poisoning us, I’m telling you,” Michael’s voice sounded nervous and secretive.

“I don’t get it, Michael. They’re doctors, why would they do that?” Jessica sounded nervous too, but more in a confused way.

“Listen, I’ve worked with you before. I’ve never worked with these people. Helen doesn’t even seem like a doctor. She told me to meditate. And that Russian guy… You know he worked for the FSB, right? Before he became an astronaut. I don’t trust this dude”.

""How are they doing it?"" Greg sounded as authoritative and skeptical as usual.

""They’re the only ones running tests in the lab, right?""

""Well, they're the best at chemistry.""

""Which gives them an advantage. How do you know the results they give us aren't tampered with?""

I entered the cafeteria. The heavy metal door slammed shut with a loud noise. All three people turned and stared at me. I’m not sure how long it lasted, but their gaze made me uncomfortable.

“Hey, Mira,” Michael quickly switched from his conspiracy-theorist tone to his usual upbeat voice. “Hungry?”

“Yeah, I’m starving and could really use some coffee,” I replied, trying to make my voice sound as casual as I could.

“Sure, let me make you some.”

I waited at the table as Michael was making my coffee and opening a package of food. The atmosphere during the meal was extremely awkward, and we all rushed to leave once we were done.

The experience made me question reality. Every astronaut knows: no matter what, you do not bring drama to a space station. You are stuck with just a few people on a piece of metal, hundreds of kilometers away from home. If you start going against each other, you’re done. Michael’s accusations were insane. Igor wasn’t necessarily my friend, but I knew him. He’s a great doctor, and he’s from my country. We had been on a mission together once, and he was nothing but helpful. I wasn’t sure if I should tell him what I’d heard. I didn’t want to create more tension, but I also didn’t want Igor to become a scapegoat.

Meanwhile, our symptoms were only getting worse. By week seven, no one could sleep more than an hour a day. Honestly, we felt lucky to even get that one hour. The migraines made everyone grumpy and easily irritated. Some of us began to have regular nosebleeds, and Hiroshi, the Japanese technician, was bleeding from his eyes. We sent an emergency request to get back to Earth for treatment. The reply took an unusually long time to arrive. When it finally came, I almost wished it hadn’t. The brief message read:

“The risk of mass infection is too high. Return is impossible. Must continue the mission.”

1lkun57,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1lkun57/a_sad_goodbye_to_the_life_i_built_in_thailand/,A Sad Goodbye to the Life I Built in Thailand,"For the past year, I’ve lived a routine that brought me more peace and happiness than I ever thought possible. I’d wake up at 5, go for a run, enjoy a quiet moment by the beach with a coffee and a blunt, then start my work day relaxed and grateful. I invested in local business, employed Thai workers, contributed to the economy, and encouraged others to come experience what I called “paradise.”

Thailand gave me the best year of my life. But that chapter is now ending.

With the recent decision to reverse cannabis legalization, it’s become clear that long term stability for investors and residents like myself is no longer guaranteed. I fully respect Thailand’s right to shape its laws, but the manner in which this policy shift was made sends a concerning message to anyone considering economic involvement here.

Instead of regulation and oversight, the government chose an outright ban, a decision that feels reactive and politically driven, rather than strategic or evidence based. Investors thrive on stability, not unpredictability. Emotionally driven policymaking creates an environment where risk outweighs reward.

Many of us who built lives and businesses here are already looking to relocate to more stable jurisdictions. You can see the shift ticket prices and declining inquiries from potential expat investors.

This isn’t just about cannabis. It’s about the signal this sends to the world: that the rules can change overnight, even after significant time, capital, and effort have been committed in good faith.

Thailand will always have a place in my heart. I love this country and its people deeply. But when future economic growth slows, property values drop, or foreign interest wanes, I hope decision makers will remember that it wasn’t inevitable.

I've also had nurses look at the scale and check to see if it is broke (Not due to an error message because that does not show up) and have me step on a mechanical scale to make sure it's right.

I have tried every diet and excersize possible.

All meat diets, Vegan diets, Veggie Diet, Keto diets. Etc. I am 282 pounds and 5 foot 9 inches. I go to the gym regularly. I can lift 50 with a bicep curl, 100 with a butterfly, 195 with my legs, and around 75 with my abs.

Despite telling the doctors this they say I need to do more despite what I do every single day at the gym. I've moved all my life I can lift furniture easily and clean up my house easily but they still say that I am overweight/obese. I have even provided Video Proof of me lifting said weights. I also do not eat as much as the average person. 2 eggs sausage with one toast in the morning and some coffee (switch days are 1 bowl of cereal or a granola bar or oats.) Dinner is consistent of a Meat, A Veggie and a Fruit and lunch for me is usually a salad or a fruit bowl.

I don't understand what I am doing wrong or if there's something wrong with me. I used to have Hypothyroidism (routine checks, it went away) and was on the Depo-Shot (Birth Control Shot) for 5 years, my A1C is fine but according to the doctors everything is fine and they believe that I'm not telling the truth.

I can also carry and lift my 130lb friend and carry her for at least 5 blocks before having to stop. (Had to do so cause she twisted her ankle and we live in a mountainous region.)

I'd really like some advice on this as I'm not getting the big picture

Edit: I went to the doctor recently about not being able to hold anything down for three days due to being sick. Last time I weighed myself I was 282.5 I am now apparently 286.7... I've been puking everything for three days how did I gain 4 pounds!",1,1750925574.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I crave deep convos, cheeky chemistry, and the kind of connection that makes the world fade out like the end of a good film. If you’re a fellow dreamer, night owl, or someone who knows there’s beauty in being truly seen—then maybe we’re overdue for a little spark of something.

Chapter 1



Scarlett Devereaux was renowned in elite circles as the ultimate seductress, with her perfectly curved red lips and those captivating cat-like eyes that could seduce anyone with just a glance.



While Jackson Blackwell was the epitome of the perfect heir of high society—untouchable, disciplined, and maddeningly self-controlled.



No one would've guessed that these two polar opposites secretly tangled in heated passion in the back of his Maybach at midnight, desperately devoured each other in charity gala bathrooms, or that he'd grip her waist against his vineyard's floor-to-ceiling windows until her legs gave out beneath her.



After yet another night of abandon, the shower's gentle patter filled the bathroom.



Scarlett lounged against the headboard, dialing her father's number:



""I'll marry that dying Miami heir for the fortune, but I have one condition..."" she said coolly.



Her father's voice crackled with barely contained excitement. ""Name it! Whatever you want. If you're willing to marry him, I'll give you anything!""



""Let's discuss it when I get home."" Her voice was soft, but her eyes remained cold and calculating.



Scarlett hung up and was about to dress when she noticed Jackson's laptop sitting nearby.



The Instagram was open, showing a message from someone labeled ""Lily.""



\[Jackson, there's a thunderstorm. I'm so scared...\]



Scarlett's fingers trembled slightly.



Just then, the bathroom door suddenly swung open as Jackson emerged, water droplets trailing down his collarbone. His shirt hung open at the top, two buttons undone, lending his typically austere appearance a hint of sensuality.



""Something came up at the office. I need to go,"" he said, reaching for his jacket, his voice maintaining its usual coolness.



Scarlett curved her lips into a smile. ""Off to the office, or running to your precious soulmate?""



Jackson looked confused. ""What?""



""Nothing,"" she replied, sliding barefoot from the bed, her pale feet sinking into the plush carpet.



His eyes darkened as he caught her chin between his thumb and forefinger, tracing her swollen lips. ""Be good. Don't cause trouble.""



As the door closed behind him, Scarlett's smile vanished instantly.



She called a car and followed him.



Half an hour later, the car stopped outside a hotel. Through the rain-streaked window, Scarlett watched as Lily Bennett, dressed in a flowing white dress, ran out from the hotel entrance.



Jackson strode forward, removing his suit jacket and draping it over her shoulders before sweeping her into his arms.



""It's freezing out here. How could you come outside without a coat, hmm?"" he chided gently.



His movements were so practiced, so natural, as if he'd done this a thousand times before.



Scarlett clutched the door handle until her nails dug painfully into her palm.



As she watched Jackson carefully carrying Lily into the hotel, she suddenly recalled the first time they'd met.



Back then, she'd been fighting bitterly with her father, had actually cracked his skull open during one particularly vicious argument. He'd shipped her off to his best friend's son for ""discipline,"" claiming his rebellious princess needed her sharp edges smoothed out.



When they first met, Jackson was sitting in his penthouse office at Blackwell Industries, his gaze icy cold behind those gold-rimmed glasses.



She was determined not to stay.



So she constantly made trouble.



On her first day, she spilled coffee all over his custom Italian suit worth hundreds of thousands. Yet Jackson merely gave her a passing glance: ""Italian cashmere, air-shipped yesterday. Put it on the Devereaux account.""



On the second day, she deliberately threw important meeting documents into the shredder. Jackson didn't flinch, reciting the entire contents from memory, leaving the executive board stunned into silence.



On the third day, she drugged his coffee and set up cameras, planning to capture embarrassing footage she could use to blackmail him.



Instead, she became his remedy.



When she woke the next morning, her entire body ached. Furious enough to commit murder, Scarlett found herself pinned against the floor-to-ceiling windows for another round.



""Scarlett,"" he whispered against her ear, his voice husky with desire, ""be good.""



Just that simple endearment—""Scarlett""—shattered her defenses.



No one had called her that so tenderly since her mother died.



From that day forward, their relationship transformed entirely.



Every time she acted out, Jackson would simply haul her into his office. Everyone assumed he was scolding her, when in reality he was bending her over his desk until her legs gave out.



Gradually, Scarlett realized she'd become addicted.



Was it his expertise? Or was she just that lonely?



She couldn't tell.



All she knew was that she'd fallen. Hard.



So on his birthday, she spent the entire day decorating his villa—roses, candles, music… She'd even bought an engagement ring.



But Scarlett waited the entire night, watched the candles burn down and the roses wilt, and still he never showed up.



Until three in the morning, when her phone suddenly pinged with a breaking news alert—



\#Billionaire CEO Picks Up Childhood Sweetheart at Airport#



The photo showed Jackson carefully helping a girl in a white dress into his car, looking at her with unbearable tenderness.



The comment section exploded:



""OMG! The CEO and his innocent princess! I'm DYING over here!""



""Holy shit! Isn't that Jackson Blackwell and Lily Bennett from Kingston Prep? They were THE couple back in the day!""



""I went to school with them and can confirm! Mr. Blackwell was ice-cold to everyone except Lily! If she hadn't gotten sick and gone abroad for treatment, they'd be married by now for sure!""



Thud!



The phone slipped from her fingers and clattered to the floor.



Scarlett couldn't believe her eyes.



If Jackson already had someone in his heart, what was she? Just a convenient fuck whenever he wanted?



Trembling, she called Jackson's number, desperate for an explanation, but her calls went straight to voicemail.



After the final failed attempt, Scarlett set down her phone and walked into Jackson's study—a room he'd explicitly forbidden her to enter.



When she pushed the door open, it felt like she'd been struck by lightning.



The room was filled with photos of Lily—graduation photos, vacation snapshots, even candid pictures of Lily sleeping.



The always-composed, always-controlled Jackson Blackwell had done something so... obsessive.



Any need for answers evaporated.



Scarlett started laughing, the sound unnaturally harsh in the empty room.



As she laughed, hot tears spilled down her cheeks, dropping onto the hardwood floor.



Red-eyed, she destroyed the entire villa.



When Jackson returned the next day and saw the devastation, he simply called for cleaning staff.



He didn't even spare her a second glance, as if her behavior was precisely what he expected.



Scarlett watched in silence as the maid swept away the engagement ring box with the rest of the debris.



He had no idea what had been inside.



No idea that she had wanted to spend her life with him.



No idea that when that ring hit the bottom of the trash can, she decided she would never love him again.



""Miss, where would you like to go?"" The driver's voice pulled her back to reality.



""Home,"" Scarlett said, opening her eyes, her voice cold. ""Take me back to the Devereaux estate.""



Upon arriving at the Devereaux mansion, her father immediately rushed to greet her. ""Scarlett, you're really willing to marry into Miami?""



From the staircase, her stepmother watched expectantly.



""Yes,"" Scarlett replied, her eyes turning frosty. ""But I mentioned a condition, didn't I?""



""What is it? Name it!""



""I want to…"" Scarlett enunciated each word clearly, ""sever all ties with you as father and daughter.""



The air suddenly felt thick and unbreathable.



Her father's face contorted with rage. ""Have you lost your mind? Do you even know what you're saying?""



""Perfectly clear,"" Scarlett's voice was ice-cold. ""You cheated while married. To make room for this homewrecker,"" she gestured toward her stepmother, ""you drove my mother to jump to her death. From that day on, I stopped considering you my father.""



She stared at her father's ashen face. ""Now Miami's dying heir is offering five hundred million for a bride to bring him luck, and you've been pressuring me for three months. If I didn't agree, were you planning to drug me and drag me there?""



""If that's how it is, what difference does it make if we're legally related or not?"" She smirked cruelly. ""You can bring your mistress's daughter home and make her the Devereaux princess instead.""



Her father trembled with fury. ""Fine! We'll sever ties! But that Miami heir reportedly won't make it to the end of the month. You MUST marry him before then!""



He laughed coldly. ""As for your stepsister, she just returned from abroad a few days ago and has been staying at a hotel. Since you're so willing to step aside, she'll move in tomorrow!""



Scarlett laughed bitterly, her heart aching. ""Rushing to raise another woman's daughter while rejecting your own. You really are one of a kind.""



She turned to leave, but her stepmother, Victoria, blocked her path with fake concern. ""Scarlett, how can you speak to your father this way?""



Scarlett stopped dead.



She slowly turned, her eyes blazing with years of suppressed hatred. ""What's wrong? Feeling like you can finally act the part of the lady of the house now that I'm leaving? Let me make something crystal clear, Victoria Bennett.""



She advanced step by step. ""Even with my mother dead, nothing changes the fact that you're just a homewrecker that everyone despises! Even if your precious daughter becomes the Devereaux princess, she'll never escape the stain of having a mother who's nothing but a cheap mistress!""



Victoria's face turned deathly pale as she stumbled backward.



Scarlett stormed away, each step feeling like walking on broken glass.



Only when she reached her room and closed the door did she slide to the floor as if all her strength had been drained, burying her face deep in her knees.



The next morning, the sounds of moving and laughter woke her.



""What's going on?"" She flung her door open. ""Can't a person get some fucking sleep around here?""



The housekeeper stammered: ""Miss Devereaux... your stepsister has moved in...""



Before he could finish, a familiar figure appeared at the staircase—



Lily Bennett, wearing a white sundress, stood there looking delicate and vulnerable.



Scarlett's blood instantly turned to ice!



Chapter 2



Scarlett could never have imagined that her stepmother's daughter, who had been ""recovering abroad"" for years, would turn out to be Jackson's precious Lily.



Life had just handed her the cruelest joke imaginable.



A moment later, Lily approached her with a sweet smile. ""Sister, I'm so sorry I disturbed your sleep...""



Before she could finish, Scarlett slammed the door shut with a thunderous bang.



""Scarlett! Where are your manners?!"" Her father roared from outside. ""Clear out your room! If Lily likes it, this will be her bedroom from now on!""



Scarlett laughed bitterly, immediately starting to pack her suitcases.



Outside, she could hear fragments of conversation—



""Uncle Richard, is Scarlett angry?"" Lily's voice was soft as honey.



""Don't worry about her. She's been spoiled rotten since childhood.""



""But...""



""Don't worry, she'll be married off to Miami soon. After that, this house will belong to you and your mother.""



Scarlett's hand paused momentarily before she smirked even more darkly.



She quickly booked an end-of-month flight to Miami and continued packing.



Half an hour later, she wheeled her luggage out of the room.



In the living room, her father, Victoria, and Lily sat on the sofa watching TV, fruit and pastries arranged on the coffee table, looking every bit the picture-perfect family.



Scarlett walked straight toward the door without a glance in their direction.



""Stop right there!"" her father commanded. ""What are you doing now? Don't forget what you promised!""



""Don't worry, I always keep my word,"" Scarlett replied without turning around. ""But for these next two weeks, I'd rather not stay somewhere that makes me sick to my stomach.""



She checked into the Presidential Suite at The Langham, Boston's most expensive hotel and embarked on a shopping spree of epic proportions.



She bought the most exquisite wedding dress, bid millions at auctions for antique jewelry to serve as her dowry.



Even if she was just a ""lucky charm"" bride, she would arrive in Miami like a queen.



Her phone buzzed relentlessly in her bag. Scarlett only checked it after purchasing her final diamond necklace.



Thirty-eight missed calls, all from her father.



She had barely swiped to answer when his furious voice exploded through the speaker: ""Have you lost your fucking mind?! You've blown through thirty million in ONE DAY! Are you trying to bankrupt me?!""



""What's the rush?"" Scarlett laughed coldly. ""Once I'm married, you'll have five hundred million coming your way.""



""But that money hasn't arrived yet! If you keep spending like this, the company will declare bankruptcy tomorrow!""



Scarlett's smile turned vicious.



That was exactly what she wanted.



The five hundred million? She'd already planned to have it transferred directly to her personal account after the wedding.



She wanted to see if Lily and her gold-digging mother would still cling so desperately to a broke old man once the money disappeared.



Did they really think everyone was as foolish as her mother? The woman who had stood by her father while he built his empire from nothing, who worked herself into the hospital with stress, only to be driven to suicide in the end?



Thinking of her mother, Scarlett's heart contracted painfully.



Her phone vibrated again with a text from Jackson: \[What's got you in a mood this time? Why didn't you come to the office today?\]



Scarlett stared at the message for a long time.



For the past year, under the guise of Jackson ""disciplining"" her, she'd reported to his office almost daily.



But now that she was about to marry someone else, what was there left for him to discipline?



When she returned to the hotel carrying over a dozen shopping bags, she found her luggage piled unceremoniously in the lobby.



""What the hell is going on?"" she demanded coldly.



The receptionist looked uncomfortable. ""Miss Devereaux, your card... was declined. According to hotel policy...""



Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from her father: \[If you want to sever ties, stop using my money. I've frozen all your accounts.\]



Scarlett stared at the screen for a long time, until her eyes burned.



Finally, she replied with just two words: \[Fine then.\]



Scarlett then dragged her suitcase down the street.



Her flight wasn't until the end of the month, and now she had nowhere to go. Where would she sleep? What would she eat? How would she survive?



Her suitcase was full of wedding dresses and dowry items she couldn't sell. As for borrowing money...



She'd rather sleep on the street than beg from those vultures in her social circle who were waiting to see her fall.



She had just settled on a park bench when a drunk man staggered over.



""Hey beautiful, all alone?"" he slurred.



""Get lost!"" she snapped.



""Don't be like that, sweetie. Keep me company for a while...""



The moment his greasy hand touched her shoulder, Scarlett raised her hand to slap him.



""ARGH!""



Jackson had appeared out of nowhere, viciously twisting the man's wrist.



Before Scarlett could react, she found herself and her luggage bundled into his car.



""Let me go!"" she protested.



Jackson gripped her flailing wrist. ""What drama are you causing now?""



His voice deepened. ""Homeless, and you still wouldn't come to me?""



Chapter 3



Those words made Scarlett's nose sting with unexpected emotion.



In the past, whenever she'd fight with her father and run away, Jackson would drive around the entire Boston looking for her, then carry her back home on his back.



""What drama are you causing now?"" He would always ask in that same tone.



She would cling to his back, breathing in the crisp scent of cedar that always surrounded him, naively believing that perhaps he cared for her, even a little.



But now she realized no one was more manipulative than him!



He clearly didn't have feelings for her, yet he slept with her anyway.



Then he'd return to his study to moon over Lily's photographs.



She couldn't understand why she wasn't enough compared to Lily.



In terms of family background, beauty, figure—how was she inferior?



Why, of all people, did he have to fall for Lily? Specifically Lily?



""Let GO!"" Scarlett's eyes welled up as she bit Jackson's hand hard.



He frowned slightly but said nothing, simply starting the car.



Jackson drove back to his estate, carrying her luggage inside without hesitation.



""Same as before,"" he said, unbuttoning his cuffs, his tone leaving no room for argument. ""Stay until you're ready to go home.""



Scarlett stood in the entryway, her fingernails digging into her palms. ""I'll only stay for two weeks. After that, I'm leaving this place forever. I'll pay you rent, and I won't bother you anymore.""



""Won't bother me anymore?"" Jackson slowly raised his eyes to look at her, his gaze unfathomable behind those gold-rimmed glasses. ""Are you sure you can manage that?""



Those words cut into her heart like a knife. Scarlett's chest constricted painfully.



So he had known all along.



He'd seen how she'd transformed from initial hostility to complete devotion.



She was hopelessly in love with him.



But what about him? He kept his heart fixated on Lily while coldly watching Scarlett fall deeper and deeper?



""Lily..."" Scarlett suddenly spoke up, ""is my stepmother's daughter. Did you know that?""



Jackson paused in the middle of removing his tie. ""I found out today.""



After a moment of silence, Scarlett couldn't help asking: ""What exactly is your relationship with her?""



""We were at school together,"" Jackson poured himself a glass of water and took a deliberate sip. ""Same university. We worked on the student council together. She saved me during a car accident once, then her health deteriorated and she's been recovering abroad ever since.""



With that, he looked directly at Scarlett, his eyes containing a warning. ""I know you have issues with your stepmother, but this has nothing to do with Lily. Don't target her.""



All the words Scarlett wanted to say became stuck in her throat.



She had planned to ask ""Do you love her?"" but now it seemed laughable.



Seeing how protective he was, what was left to ask?



She turned and retreated to the guest room, slamming the door behind her.



That night, for the first time ever, Jackson didn't come to her.



Scarlett lay in bed, staring at the ceiling blankly.



Of course. His precious Lily was back now. Why would he still bother with her?



The next day, Scarlett deliberately slept until noon, hoping to avoid Jackson.



But when she opened the door, she discovered he was still home.



He sat on the couch, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his straight nose, flipping through a financial magazine.



""Awake?"" he asked without looking up.



""You're not at the office?""



""It's the weekend.""



Scarlett made a noncommittal sound, taking a few pastries from the refrigerator, intending to retreat to her room.



But Jackson suddenly spoke up: ""Change your clothes. We're attending an event together later.""



Scarlett wanted to refuse, but realized she'd rather be out in public than alone with Jackson in the house.



So she changed and went with him.



Only upon arrival did Scarlett discover this was Lily's welcome-home party.



She turned to leave, but Lily enthusiastically caught her arm: ""Sis, I'm so glad you came! Don't fight with Uncle Richard anymore. He was so worried after you left home that he didn't eat for a whole day.""



Scarlett laughed coldly: ""So you know he's just your 'uncle'? Then whether I fight with him or leave home, what business is it of yours? Are you the goddamn neighborhood watch? Mind your own business.""



She yanked her arm away and walked into the private room, catching a glimpse of Lily tearing up and looking pleadingly at Jackson.



Jackson gave Scarlett a dark, warning glance before gently stroking Lily's hair and saying something that made her smile through her tears.



Scarlett's heart stabbed with pain as she tipped back a flute of champagne in one gulp.

🔥Betrayed by fiancé, drowned in Scotch... then woke up in her boss's bed. One night wasn't enough for Roman—now he wants forever. Can Blair escape his ruthless obsession? 😍🔞

https://i.redd.it/vndso0vz989f1.gif

# Chapter One

Blair was so grateful to be home. She just didn’t understand the demon that had possessed her boss during their recent business trip. He had driven everyone hard. They arrived home one day earlier than planned, but she was glad to be away from him.

She had expected to return to the office with him. To her surprise, he gave her the rest of the afternoon off. Maybe he’d decided they both needed a break. That was fine by her.

Lately, he’d been a real shithead. Short-tempered and demanding. When he dropped her off at her front door, she almost flipped him the bird. She paused, unsure whether he’d catch the gesture in the rear-view mirror.

Roman had this uncanny ability to sense everything. It was almost like he had eyes in the back of his head. You’d think being gorgeous would make him a bit easier to work with. But no. If anything, it made him more of an ass. He was hot, and he knew it. Most everyone always fell at his feet trying to please the man.

She didn’t know what was going on. Roman had seemed more irritable in the past few months. He’d been rubbing her the wrong way. Of the two years she’d worked for him, these last two months had been the worst. If he didn’t pay her so well, or if she didn’t need the job so badly, maybe she would tell him where to go.

Blair shook her head. That wasn’t true. Despite his sometimes shitty attitude, Roman did look after his staff. The benefits at Kingston’s were great. People put up with more for the right perks.

The office offered excellent medical and dental coverage. There was always childcare within the building, and the company was cutting back on maternity leave. It was a win-win for Kingston.

Blair picked up her case and headed for the front door of the townhouse she shared with her cousin Laura and her fiancé Dan.

She checked her watch as she reached the front door. Dan wouldn’t be home for a few hours. She planned to surprise him with a romantic dinner.

Laura was rarely home at night, always out partying. Her cousin was a model-not a supermodel, but still gorgeous. She knew how to make the most of it. Blair, on the other hand, wasn’t interested in clothes or makeup. She was more into books.

They had both moved to the city for different reasons. Laura to follow her modeling career and for Blair, it had been a chance to work for a great company like Kingston Industries. Under normally the great man himself Roman Kingston. The company had their fingers in so many pies, Blair was never bored. Even when Roman was being his most demanding. She loved her job.

Fishing for her keys. She juggled her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase. Once the key was in the lock, it turned easily. Blair pushed the door open. Stepping inside, she put her handbag and suitcase down at the bottom of the stairs. Before heading into the lounge room where she kept a desk. Sitting her briefcase on top.

Blair turned to make her way to the kitchen, pondering what to prepare for dinner. As she walked past the foot of the stairs, a sudden noise from upstairs caused her to halt in her tracks. Was there someone else in the house? Had she returned home to an intruder? Filled with panic, Blair took a step towards the front door, ready to flee.

However, at that moment, she realized something. Laura. Unlike Blair and Dan, Laura didn’t adhere to their typical working hours. She often slept late and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. It wasn’t the first time Blair had found her slumped on the front steps as she was leaving for work in the morning. Blair wasn’t sure if she should call out now. What if it wasn’t her cousin?

Her eyes scanned the room for something to defend herself with… just in case. Her gaze landed on her late father’s baseball bat, which she always kept near the front door when she was home alone at night. It made her feel safer.

She grabbed the bat, weighting it in her hand for a moment. Before she set foot on the stairs, she paused, wondering if any of them creaked. She couldn’t remember. Taking a deep breath to steady her racing heart, Blair ascended the stairs slowly, step by step.

When she reached the landing, she stopped, straining to listen.

“Please be Laura. Please be Laura, and not some masked man waiting to jump out at me,” she muttered under her breath.

The hallway stretched ahead, with four doors. Three led to the bedrooms, and one opened to the shared bathroom. The only door ajar was the one to her and Dan’s bedroom. The others were shut. But to get to her bedroom, she’d have to pass the other doors.

That’s when she heard it, the unmistakable sound of a giggle from Laura, followed by a low, male groan. Relief flooded her chest. It wasn’t a burglar. Laura had brought someone home.

Just as Blair was about to turn away and leave, she heard the voice of the man Laura was with.

“God, yes,” the voice groaned.

Blair froze, her heart pounding. No. It couldn’t be.

“Laura, you’re so fucking hot,” Dan’s voice came from their bedroom.

Her eyes widened. Dan. In their bed. With Laura. Blair’s stomach lurched.

This couldn’t be happening. She moved quietly down the hall until she stood outside her bedroom door, praying this was all some kind of terrible misunderstanding.

With a trembling hand, she pushed the door open.

The sight that greeted her was like a punch to the gut. She staggered backward, her mind unable to process what she was seeing.

There, in the middle of the bed, was Dan, flat on his back, with Laura straddling him, completely naked. She was moving up and down on him, her hands gripping his chest hair. From this angle, Blair could see Dan’s cock thrusting in and out of Laura. It felt like she was watching a scene from a porn film.

Dan’s hands gripped Laura’s waist and ass, guiding her movements.

“Err, yes, fuck me harder,” Laura moaned.

Blair lifted a hand to her mouth to stop herself from crying out. No, no, no, no.

Dan’s grip tightened on Laura’s ass, spreading her cheeks wider.

Blair had never seen Laura naked before, not that it mattered when she was currently riding Blair’s fiancé.

How could she do this? They had both watched Laura’s father, Peter, cheat repeatedly on Laura’s mother, creating a toxic home life. Blair had lived with them after losing her parents in a plane crash ten years ago. She had thought if anyone would understand the devastation of betrayal, it would be Laura.

This had to be a nightmare. Blair pinched herself, hard, as the sting registered immediately. Not a nightmare.

Dan had always hated Laura. He’d called her a slut. Mocked her outfits. Said she was shallow, incapable of real conversation.

Was it all a lie? Had he been jealous of the men in her life? Was that why?

One thing was certain, Dan’s mother, Paula, would never accept Laura as a suitable wife for her son.

But none of that mattered now. What was she supposed to do? How did someone handle this? It was like a scene from a B-grade movie.

She couldn’t pretend she hadn’t seen it. She didn’t want Dan anymore… not now, not after this. Taking him back would be disgusting.

How long had this been going on?

They had been living together for five months. Dan had moved in with her and Laura to save money before the wedding. Had he been fucking Laura the whole time?

“Laura, you are so goddamn tight,” Dan groaned, arching his back.

“Is my pussy better than Blair’s?” Laura asked, riding him harder.

Blair’s heart stopped. Did she know Blair was standing here? Had she asked that on purpose?

Blair bit into her hand to keep from making a sound. She had given Dan her virginity. He had known what that meant to her. Knowing that he had done this.

She hadn’t even planned to be home today. She had wanted to surprise him.

The surprise had been on her.

She felt sick. A cold sweat broke over her skin.

Her other hand came up, gripping the doorframe for balance. Something solid pressed against her palm. The bat.

For a fleeting second, she thought about using it. Smashing the bed, the nightstand, the both of them. But she wasn’t that person. She rested the bat against the doorframe just in case she changed her mind and used it on them.

So instead, she straightened her spine. Let the rage steel her so when she finally spoke, her voice was calm. Icy, emotionless.

“While you two finish up, should I cook dinner?”

# Chapter Two

“Fuck me.” Dan's head came up off the bed as he pushed Laura off his body. Blair could see the horror on his face when he saw her standing at the door. He’d been caught with his pants down, or off, as it was in this case. Laura scrambled across the bed, pulling a blanket over her naked body. Her face was filled with shock, showing her cousin hadn’t known of Blair’s presence. The expression she wore was incredibly real and impossible to fake.

“No thanks. Looks like Laura has taken care of that for you.” Blair was surprised how calm she sounded. When all she truly wanted to do was scream and shout and throw things. What would it accomplish? She would still have a broken relationship.

“Blair! What are you doing home today?” Dan’s cock was wet and laying limp against his leg. Having his fiance walk in on him mustn’t be a turn on, it would seem.

Blair lifted an eyebrow at him. “That’s what you are worried about? Might be an idea to cover up.”

Blair was watching Dan with narrowed eyes. She had loved him, but the person she saw now was ugly to her. It didn’t matter anymore that he was very attractive. To her, he was ugly. No one should cheat on someone they claimed to love. Even if someone had held a gun to her head, she would have refused. It was a shame Dan hadn’t felt the same. As far as she could see, Laura hadn’t needed to force him. Hearing them talk during the act had told her that.

Blair put the bat down, resting it against the wall near the door. Just in case. She told herself that she wouldn’t use it, but who knew? Crimes of passion that had to have come from somewhere. Normal everyday people committing a crime in the heat of the moment. So it was safer if she put it down. Blair then crossed her arms across her chest. Looking back to see Dan had gotten off the bed and was pulling on his work pants.

She flicked her eyes to Laura. The bitch now had a smug look on her face. It had replaced the look of shock. Why?

Blood was roaring in her ears as she came to terms with the total destruction of her personal life. She never wanted to see him again, but she and Dan both worked for Kingston. She had applied first. Dan hadn’t joined the company until a year later.

Blair decided then and there she would not be leaving her job. It was her only concrete thing she could hang onto, then she was keeping it. It wasn’t like they work directly together.

Dan took a step towards her, reaching out his hand. “Baby..”

Blair took a step back. “Don’t you dare touch me?” Not only could she not stomach it, but who knows where that hand had been?

The venom in Blair's voice brought him up short. He turned to look at Laura before returning his eyes to her face. Blair knew she was pale. Who wouldn’t be?

“You have to believe me. This was a one time thing. It will never happen again. It meant nothing.” Dan pleaded with her.

Blair could see the look on Laura's face. Even before seeing it, she knew he was lying. Dan had a tell. When he lied, his right eyebrow would go up. Before today, the lies had never been a big deal, just little things. Had she noticed it when he had talked about Laura in the past? Blair wasn’t sure. Because sometimes the sub-conscious mind could even fool ourselves.

“Do you know Dan? It doesn’t matter.” Blair angled her chin up as her nails dug into her palm. “This one time was all it took.”

“What.. No, Blair baby please, I love you.” Dan tried to take her in his arms.

Blair moved quickly, picked up the bat, and swung it so the end pressed up against his chest, pushing him back and holding him at bay. “Don’t even think about it.”

Dan looked down at the bat, raising his hands back at his shoulder level. “Please, she seduced me. You know what a slut she is. I was missing you.”

They both heard the gasp from the bed. Before Laura responded. “He’s lying Blair. This has been going on for months. Soon after, he moved in.”

“Shut up, you dumb bitch.” Dan turned to yell at her. Before saying to Blair. “She is lying.”

Blair shrugged. “Doesn’t matter. It only took the one time Dan.” She nudged him with the baseball bat. “Don’t call Laura a dumb bitch. I may never forgive her for this, but you were the one in a relationship, Dan, not her.” Blair could see Laura sliding out of the bed, scrambling around for her clothing, still holding the sheet to her breasts. “If you think she is a slut, what the fuck does that make you?” Blair knew she would not feel clean even if she had ten showers. This was going to take time.

Blair knew she couldn’t deal with anymore right now. She needed to leave before they were both dressed. She needed to think, to process. Turning on her heel, she ran down the stairs. Quickly grabbing the suitcase, handbag. Blair only just remembered the briefcase as she was about to leave through the front door.

“You stupid slut, why did you have to say anything?” Dan’s angry voice came from upstairs

Blair rushed to her desk, picked up the briefcase and stood at the front door, ready to leave. Knowing once she walked through it, she wasn’t coming back. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Following Dan’s insult came Laura's high-pitched squeal. “I’m not a slut Dan.”

“You and your big mouth. You wanted this to happen, didn’t you?” Dan accused.

Blair could hear the tears in Laura's voice. “You didn’t mind my mouth when it was sucking your cock.”

“Shh.” Dan was worried she was hearing their argument. “You set me up, didn’t you? You knew she was coming home.”

“Dan I didn’t know.” Laura cried.

If she stayed any longer, both of them would have gotten dressed and then they would come down here, and she didn’t want another confrontation.

Taking a deep breath, Blair stepped through the front door, not looking back even as she heard Dan calling her name from inside the house.

# Chapter Three

Blair waved down a taxi. She shoved open the taxi door and climbed into the backseat as quickly as she could, intent on getting out of here as fast as possible. She felt like getting drunk. But if she went to a bar alone during the day, that would be inviting trouble. She could feel the tears as they slid unchecked down her face. She had held herself together while she had confronted Dan and Laura.

“Where to?” the driver asked, his voice cutting through the fog in her brain.

Where to? Good question.

Home wasn’t an option. Sutton and Keira were at work, and she didn’t want to sit in their empty apartment, replaying the image of Dan tangled in her cousin’s sheets. She needed a drink. But sitting alone in a bar in the middle of the afternoon? That felt like waving a white flag.

She hesitated, then rattled off the address of her office. At least there, she could pretend to be productive. Maybe even figure out what the hell to do next.

The taxi pulled away from the kerb and she exhaled, trying to steady herself.

The driver looked at her in the rearview mirror. “There are tissues in the center compartment if you need them, hon.”

The driver’s voice was gentle, like he’d seen enough women cry in his backseat to know when to speak and when to keep quiet.

Blair grabbed a handful. “Thanks.” She said before cleaning her face as best she could. It wasn’t like she wore a lot of makeup. So she might as well clean her face.

Her phone began to ring. Dan.

She still pulled it out of her to check. Her stomach clenched as she stared at the screen, his name glowing in bright white letters.

She could just imagine the first words he would say.

“It’s not what it looks like, Blair.”

“I can explain.”

“Please, just let me talk to you.”

Lies. Excuses. The same bullshit men always spewed when they got caught.

She set the phone to silent and shoved it back into her bag.

By the time the taxi pulled up in front of the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries, her makeup was beyond saving. She reached into her purse, dug out a crumpled twenty, and handed it to the driver.

“Be honest,” she said, forcing a smile. “Do I look like a woman who just found out her fiancé is screwing her cousin?”

The driver hesitated, giving her a careful once-over. “Your eyes are a little red, honey, but it’s hardly noticeable.” He paused. “Are you going to be okay?”

The unexpected kindness nearly undid her.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. “Yeah. Better to find out now, right? Just a little dump on the road of life.” She wasn’t sure who she was trying to convince the taxi driver or herself.

After paying the driver in cash, she climbed out of the taxi, hoisted her suitcase onto the curb and took a deep breath. Blair checked her phone screen to see Dan had called her six times and left six messages on her voicemail. Uninterested in what he had to say for himself, she slid the phone away in her handbag.

Blair turned toward the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries. Roman had bought the building five years ago. The top eight floors belonged to Kingston, the lower three rented out to smaller businesses. With the way the company was expanding, she wouldn’t be surprised if they took over the whole thing eventually.

She walked inside, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.

“Miss Warner, Can I help you?” Blair blinked. Maggie, one of the receptionists, had stepped out from behind the lobby front desk, her gaze flicking over Blair.

Maggie stepped forward, taking the suitcase from her. In the same hand, she was still holding the bat. Blair had completely forgotten that she was even holding it in her hand.

Blair had walked into the office looking like she was about to commit a felony. She was relieved, though. It was something she wouldn’t need to retrieve later.

Blair exhaled, relieved. “Thanks, Maggie. Can I leave everything here while I freshen up?” She was surprised her voice sounded so... normal.

“Of course, Miss Warner.” Maggie’s eyes darted to the bat again.

“Blair, please. How many times do I have to tell you?” Roman preferred first names, but some staff-especially the newer ones-struggled with that.

More with Roman than with her.

Maggie smiled, taking the suitcase, briefcase, and bat.

Blair headed across the foyer to the restroom.

Inside, she went straight to the mirrors. The cab driver hadn’t just been kind. She really didn’t look that bad. She pulled a makeup wipe from her bag and cleaned off the last remnants of mascara. A quick dusting of powder, some lip gloss, a little eyeliner.

She pinched her cheeks. People always said that added color, but she didn’t see a difference.

Her blue eyes were still a little red, but there wasn’t much she could do about that. She pulled out a brush, freed her long, wavy blonde hair from its bun, and redid it neatly. Good enough.

She left the restroom, retrieved her belongings from Maggie, and headed to the elevators. As she waited, she tried to recall Roman’s schedule. Did he have any meetings this afternoon?

Then it hit her. He shouldn’t have been home today. So no meetings were scheduled in his calendar.

She sighed. Her brain was fried. But walking in on your fiancé shagging your cousin would do that to anyone.

The thought made her frown.

How often had they been doing this? Dan had been at home during a workday. She traveled occasionally for work, but not that often. If their affair had been going on for months, they had to have been meeting up on company time.

The elevator arrived. A woman she didn’t recognize stepped in with her.

Blair offered a polite, strained smile. When the woman got off at the second floor, Blair leaned back against the wall, staring at nothing.

Should she tell Roman about Dan? It would feel like sour grapes-tattling just because he cheated. But he was also ripping off the company. No way could he get home, have sex with Laura, and get back to the office during a lunch break.

The elevator dinged open. Blair inhaled deeply before stepping onto the executive floor.

Kara, the receptionist on the executive floor, looked up. “Hey, Blair. I didn’t think you’d be in today.”

Blair smiled. “Wasn’t planning to be, but I figured I’d get a jump on the meeting notes for Roman. Is he in?”

Kara shook her head. “No, he left a little while ago. Called to have his calls held.”

Blair almost sagged in relief. She wouldn’t have to face him just yet.

“Thanks, Kara.”

She went to her office, shut the door, and sank into her chair.

Blair rested her head on the desk. Shit. She felt like a wrecking ball had just split her world in two.

How could he? But even worse than that, how could Laura?

The childish problems they had all had as kids, Blair had thought, they had grown out of that. Laura had always been a spoiled brat. Taking what wasn’t hers.

The problem was her parents, Blair’s aunt and uncle, doted on her and gave her everything she wanted. But when they had moved to the city two years ago, Laura hadn’t been that bad or by now Blair would have moved in with her sisters. She hadn’t when Sutton had come back from Europe because her sister Keira had just finished university. Keira had moved in with Sutton. She would have felt guilty leaving Laura on her own to move in with her sisters. What was the point, anyway? She and Dan had planned on getting a place of their own once they were married.

Lifting her head, Blair looked down at the ring on her finger. The engagement ring Dan had given her.

It wasn’t big. She hadn’t wanted big. She would make sure he got it back. He could sell it. Because she was sure Laura would want a big flashy ring. She had made fun of Blair’s ring.

Taking it off, Blair was about to throw it across the room. No, just in case it went missing. Opening the top drawer of her desk, Blair dropped it in, slamming it shut. She needed a drink. Standing, Blair went into Roman’s office, where she knew he kept a bottle of scotch. She wasn’t much of a spirit drinker, but anything would do.

Roman office was a statement of the man himself. Everything was big, strong, and masculine. “Don’t forget intimidating.” Blair said to the empty room.

Going to his desk, she opened the bottom drawer and pulled out the bottle of scotch that Roman kept there. Taking it, she sat down on his Chestfield lounge near the window. She opened the bottle and took a drink. Almost coughing it back up. “Holy shit, this shit burns.” Blair knew it was an expensive bottle Roman only liked the best.

The problem was, it was straight. Why did he like this shit straight? This time, when she put the bottle to her mouth, Blair made sure to sip it this time. Nope, that didn’t help. But it wasn’t as bad as the first drink. So she had another. Laying her head back against the lounge. She had come here to think. What was her next move?

Lifting her hand so she could see the dial on her watch, Blair saw it was 3:15pm. She couldn’t call Sutton or Keira. Not yet. Let them get home from work. Blair planned to ask Sutton and Keira to assist her in organizing getting her stuff from the apartment. Although she didn’t want to put too much pressure on her older sister, Sutton. She was six months pregnant, and it hadn’t been an easy pregnancy.

Men. Why were they assholes? First, her boss for being so arrogant and intimidating and sometimes rude. Then Dan, who had been cheating on her with her cousin Laura for months. How low was that? Then there was Luca, the father of Sutton’s baby. Who had left her high and dry and pregnant?

Then she would see about crashing at their place until she could find somewhere. Their place wasn’t big enough for three adults and a baby. When it arrived. But it would be great to spend some time with her sisters. Eat ice cream and talk shit about men.

Although Sutton didn’t even talk about the man that had gotten her pregnant. It was a topic she refused to discuss. Even when their aunt Viv and uncle Peter had demanded answers. Blair lifted the bottle again to her mouth. Only she and Keira knew his first name.

The phone started ringing on Roman’s desk. Blair tried to ignore it, but as soon as it stop ringing it started again. Blair shifted to the edge of the lounge, rising to her feet. The room seemed to tilt ever so slightly, prompting a quick “Oops.” to escape her lips.

After regaining her balance, she made her way over to the phone and lifted the receiver.

“Hello?” she greeted into the handset. Not very professional, she thought.

“Roman please.” Blair knew the voice. It was Claire Robertson. Roman’s little piece of fluff. It was the best way to describe Claire. She had this stupid girly voice that set Blair’s teeth on edge.

“Roman isn’t here.” Blair put a hand on Roman’s desk to help stop the swaying of the room.

“Where is he?” Claire asked.

“How the hell should I know?” Blaire was surprised by her answer. Shit, where had that come from?

“You are his secretary.” Blair could hear the anger in the other woman’s voice.

“Yes, but I’m not his keeper and I sure as hell don’t own a crystal ball. Call or message his mobile.” Blair was over this conversation.

“He isn’t answering his mobile hasn’t for days.” Claire whined.

Blair’s lips parted slightly. Oh.

That was Roman’s move. He didn’t argue, didn’t make dramatic exits. He just started to avoid before making a clean break. If Claire hadn’t heard from him in days, it was over. She just didn’t know it yet.

The little devil on her shoulder made her do it. But Blair couldn’t help the next words. “Well, one of two things has happened. Either you’re about to get dumped, or he’s dead. Either way, flowers will be involved.”

Blair sighed when she heard the shocked gasp from the other end of the phone, the scotch warming her veins, and loosening her tongue. “Look, Claire, let’s be honest. He’s not marriage material. Find someone new.” She didn’t wait for a reply, just hung up and dropped the receiver back into place.

She collapsed back onto the Chesterfield, lifting the bottle to her lips again.

Her own problems resurfaced to haunt her. How was she so blind? How did she not pick up on the signs? She wasn’t an idiot. Dan was a salesman. He had sold her the dream of happily ever after. She had just been blind to the cracks in their relationship.

Not only that, it looked like she had been missing something in her sex life. If what she had witnessed between Dan and Laura was any indication of how the act should be. She enjoyed it well enough, but it wasn’t something that made her cry out like Laura had been doing. Was that to stroke his ego? Should she have been doing that? The thing was, she didn’t know.

Dan had been her only lover. It had been his job to teach her.

Blair sighed, lifting the bottle again-only to pause when she noticed two tall, blurry figures standing in front of her.

Wait. No. Not two. Just one.

Blair squinted. “Hi.”

She tried to sit up, bringing the bottle to her mouth, but before she could take another sip, it was plucked from her hand.

“Hey,” she protested. “That’s mine. If you want one, go find your own.”

She blinked, trying to focus.

The man standing in front of her-the one holding the bottle-came into view.

“Roman?”

“Blair,” he said, his voice unreadable. “What have you done to yourself?”

“Well,” she said, slurring slightly, “I think that’s... pretty obvious. As you can see, I’m getting shit-faced.” She reached for the bottle. “Now give it back so I can finish the job.”

Roman stepped away, placing the bottle on his desk. “I think you’ve had enough.”

Blair frowned. “You know... sometimes you can be an asshole. No-most of the time.”

“I do believe you’re going to regret this tomorrow.”

Then, to her surprise, he sat down beside her.

# Chapter Four

“You’re not just an asshole, but a shithead too... always thought so,” Blair slurred, her tongue feeling too heavy in her mouth. She knew she shouldn’t be saying this, but she couldn’t stop herself.

Roman chuckled, leaning back. “I think I should get you some coffee.”

“Don’ want it.” Blair waved a hand dismissively, nearly hitting herself in the face. “I want... a man that ain’t a cheatin’ rat.” Her eyes drifted over him, and despite her best efforts, she noticed-really noticed-how attractive he was. “Did you... did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?”

She’d met Jessica once. It hadn’t been a pleasant experience.

Roman’s expression didn’t change, but his voice softened. “Not all men cheat, Blair.”

“W-why’d she leave you then?” Her head tilted as if she were trying to piece together a puzzle.

“There are a lot of reasons marriages fall apart,” Roman said, dragging a hand down his face. “Not all of them have to do with cheating on the man’s part.”

It took Blair a moment to process that. Then her eyes widened. “She cheated on you?” she whispered, as if it were some great secret. “Was she an idiot?”

Her boss was gorgeous-thick dark hair, intense gray eyes, chiseled cheekbones. And his body... well, from what she could see, it was fine. Not that she’d ever been interested before. She’d always been with Dan. Had been with Dan.

Roman reached over, gently lifting her chin with two fingers when her mouth fell open. “I worked a lot. Some would say I drove her to it.”

Blair blinked at him, then shook her head, making herself dizzy. “Thass not an excuse... nope... no, no, no.” She dropped her head back onto the couch, exhaling loudly. “Should get a divorce before that... cheaters... all of ‘em...”

Roman studied her with an amused expression. “You know, this is the most I’ve ever seen you relax around me.”

Blair lifted a hand lazily. “Thass ‘cause you’re... you’re normally soooo difficult to deal wit’” she muttered, barely able to get the words out.

“I won’t apologize for that.” His lips twitched. “I expect the best. That’s why this company is where it is today.”

Blair made a sound that was half a grunt, half a laugh. “Suppose so...” Her head felt heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Roman let her sit in silence for a moment before asking, “What happened, Blair?”

She turned her head to look at him, her vision slightly unfocused. “I was an idiot.”

“Why? Because you trusted the wrong person?”

Blair let out a shaky breath. “Dan an’ I grew up together, y’know?”

“No, I didn’t.”

She nodded. “I... I was always going home... back home, all the time, when I moved to th’ city for this job. He... he got a job at Kingston’s, and I was happy ‘bout it. Now I wish he wasn’t here.” Her voice wobbled, but she refused to cry. Not again. Not for Dan.

“So, the wedding’s off?” Roman gestured to her bare finger.

Blair lifted her hand, staring at it for a second before letting it flop back onto her lap. “Yep. We didn’t even have a date set.”

“Who was holding it up?”

She blinked at him. Why was he askin’ so many questions? Why was he bein’ so... nice? “Me. He wanted to get married last year. I wasn’t ready.”

Roman’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Why? If you loved him, why did you want to wait?”

Blair shrugged, though it was a little sloppy. “If what I saw t’day was anythin’ to go by...” She trailed off, frowning. Maybe... maybe she’d always known somethin’ was off. There was no passion. No fire. She’d loved Dan, but maybe not the way she was supposed to love the man she was gonna marry.

Right now, she wasn’t even sad. Just... angry.

“What happened?” Roman pressed, his voice gentler now.

Blair’s face scrunched up as she remembered. “Saw him,” she slurred. “H-havin’ sex with... ugh.” She waved a hand, unable to finish the sentence.

Roman’s jaw tensed. “I see.”

Blair stared at him for a long moment, her head swimming with thoughts she couldn’t quite hold on to. Then, suddenly, she reached out, grabbing his tie between her fingers.

Roman froze.

Blair stared at the fabric, tracing the pattern with unfocused eyes. She didn’t know why she did it. Maybe ‘cause she needed to know. Needed to feel something different.

Without another thought, she pulled at the tie, closing the space between them, and pressed her lips to his.

For a moment, he didn’t move. But then… Heat. Raw, consuming heat.

Blair gasped into his mouth, the shock of it searing through her. Her hands flew to his shoulders, gripping the fabric of his shirt, desperate to hold on to something solid.

This was different. So different.

Roman pulled back, breathing hard, his gray eyes dark with something unreadable. “Blair,” he murmured, voice rough. “We shouldn’t-“

She cut him off with another kiss, moving closer, pressing against him.

“Please,” she whispered, her voice trembling.

She needed to forget.

And she wanted… to feel.

It's a full-fledged ingredient that can add flavor, aroma, and even mood! Especially in summer, when you want your glass to be refreshing, tasty, and visually appealing.

Here are some fun ideas for making special ice — perfect for lemonades, cocktails, tea, or even just plain water:

**Juice Ice**  
Freeze orange, cherry, tomato, or any other juice without adding water. Bold flavor and bright color — ideal for Campari, bumbles, or summer iced teas.

**Purée Ice**  
Use fruit or berry purée in molds — it comes out rich and flavorful. Great for chilled desserts and strong-tasting drinks.

**Ice with Berries and Fruit**  
Chop up strawberries, kiwi, peaches, or use whole currants and blueberries. It looks beautiful and adds a subtle fruity note.

**Herb and Spice Ice**  
Rosemary, thyme, basil, ginger, cinnamon — these add aroma and a touch of culinary depth. Perfect for lemonades and iced tea.

**Milk Ice**  
Made from milk, cream, or with a splash of coffee — ideal for coffee drinks, White Russians, or iced lattes. Just be sure to use low-fat milk to avoid separation.

**Colored Ice**  
Want to play with color? Use food coloring. Not the healthiest option, but it looks stunning in clear cocktails and sparkling water.",1,1750924635.0,u_oduvangames,0,1.0,False

1lkuagm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AuthorSpeak/comments/1lkuagm/autumn_love/,Autumn Love,"She willed herself to not to check her phone to see if he had replied. It had been about three days now. She hated that she was constantly checking his ‘last seen at’ status and yes, he had logged in just five minutes ago. Yet she couldn’t stop herself. This sinking feeling to find absolutely no communication from him was becoming unbearable, almost tortuous.

And then, just as she sat down in her chair, her phone vibrated. With her heart thudding in her ear, she unlocked her phone and stared at the screen. Finally! It was his message.

But when she opened it and read it, she nearly stopped breathing. She didn’t know if he was joking or not. What was this? \[\*\]

‘Is it a point of no return?’ she thought involuntarily moving to the edge of the chair.

Reading his ‘have you forgotten about the castration?’ message, she sank into the chair thinking, ‘is it a lighthearted joke or as a loaded message?’, and for a clue, began to recall the events of the year passed by.

‘Oh, how my life had turned on its head when I turned fifty?’ she thought in wonderment. ‘That’s when I immunized my heart against attractions and insulated my life from vacillations! So I believed, didn’t I? But when he enamored my heart to give a flirty spin to my life, didn’t it dawn upon me that I had only sterilized it for a ritual regimen, and no more. Oh, how his first glance pierced my heart to stir my life that very instant!’

Returning from a temple when she found him alone in the drawing room, she felt as if god had sent his angle to receive her in her own abode. The moment their eyes met, it was as if they began their joint search for a love ground to share, which they had to abandon as her husband entered the scene from behind the curtain.

He was a friend of her husband’s childhood pal settled in the States. Having spent the best part of his life there, he came back with his wife for good, leaving their two children, who were US citizens. That was six months back and they had since settled in Hyderabad, where, incidentally, both her married daughters stayed. As he happened to be in their town alone, to explore some business opportunities there, that evening, he came to call on her husband at their common-friend’s behest. Introductions over, as her husband wanted her to prepare some coffee for them; she went into the kitchen with a heavy heart.

‘While my missing his sight had understandably irked me, didn’t the thought that he too would miss my sight inexplicably hurt me?’ she began reminiscing about that dream encounter. ‘But then, how the smell of the boiling decoction lifted my spirits for it portended serving him some steamy coffee with my own hands. When he said he never tasted anything better, how I hoped he would leave some dregs for my palate to share his satisfaction. What a disappointment it was seeing him empty the cup and how exhilarated I was when he said he had broken his life-long habit of leaving the dregs. Then, as he was preparing to leave, how depressed I was, but how relieved I was when my husband invited him to visit us again!’

She got up from the chair and as if to walk down the memory lane, she walked up to the compound gate.

‘Oh, how that fateful evening changed the autumn tenor of my life!’ she went on reminiscing. ‘Were it the deities I pray that chose to pave a pathway of love for me? Or was it a case of my prayers gone awry? Before he stirred my heart, how sedate was my life, sterile though? After all, there was no material change after he had entered into it. Neither I did I venture onto his love ground nor did I let him into my sexual sphere. Why should life seem drab now as he cold shouldered me? Why not, won’t the change of heart alter the tenor of life? Even the one as dull as mine, well, but it did start on an exciting note for a provincial girl like me.’

She was born to humble parents, who felt increasingly proud of her as she grew up. After all, she turned out to be the small town’s beauty and the brains of its academics. When she was eighteen, calf love turned a new leaf in her life. The object of her adoration happened to be the stopgap lecturer from a nearby town. He taught maths alright but the equation was wrong for their marriage as he was doubly aged and twice married. Yet, amidst the protestations from her parents, with her tenacity of love, augmented by obduracy of adventure, she ascended the altar to be led by him to his native town. Her marital life, underscored by her zest for it, though clouded by his thrift, was exemplified by her two cute daughters born in quick succession.

‘Didn’t his thrift drift towards miserliness soon pushing my life into nothingness.’ she began to recollect that phase of her life when her children were growing up. ‘Why, as his passion for lovemaking too lost traction, how my life entered into the arena of frustration? Yet I shut my mind to adulterous thoughts, didn’t I? But did he stop at that? Why, he did acquire a sense of insecurity as well and how insensibly I imbibed both his vices! Maybe that’s why I learnt short-hand as a long handle for my secretarial security. Was it really so? Wouldn’t have my own fear of the future bred an urge for self-preservation in my subconscious mind? Who knows, I might’ve been.

I’ve been living in Bali for a few years and see a lot of first-timers fall into the same overpriced, overhyped, and underwhelming tourist traps.

Here’s a no-BS guide to the tourist traps to avoid in Bali (as of 2025) -  and some solid alternatives that'll give you a better, more authentic experience.

# 1. “Luwak Coffee” Tours (Civet Coffee)

These coffee plantations are all over Ubud and on the road to Kintamani. They offer a free tasting, but the real purpose is to sell you overpriced ""kopi luwak"" — coffee made from beans eaten and excreted by caged civet cats. Yes, it’s as weird as it sounds, and no, it's not ethical.

**Why it’s a trap:** Animal cruelty, fake “wild” civets, and coffee that costs 10x more than it's worth.

**Instead:** Visit a specialty coffee shop like **Seniman Coffee Studio** in Ubud or **Expat. Roasters** in Seminyak for ethically sourced and expertly brewed coffee.

# 2. Bali Swings (the Instagram Kind)

Yes, the big swings over rice fields look cool on IG. But in real life? You’ll pay $15–30 for 3 minutes of swinging, wait in line, and pose next to 50 other people doing the same thing.

**Why it’s a trap:** Overpriced, staged, and not really a “local” experience.

**Instead:** Want great views? Hike **Campuhan Ridge Walk** (free), visit **Tegalalang early in the morning**, or take a real jungle trek near **Sidemen**.

# 3. Overcrowded “Secret Beaches”

Places like **Diamond Beach** or **Broken Beach (Nusa Penida)** are stunning in photos but packed with tourists unless you go very early. Same with **Melasti** and **Padang Padang** in Uluwatu.

**Why it’s a trap:** Not secret anymore. Expensive parking, queues, vendors, and sometimes scams (like “mandatory guides”).

**Instead:** Check out **Nunggalan Beach**, **Gunung Payung**, or **Bias Tugel** — quieter and equally beautiful if you’re willing to walk a bit.

# 4. Mount Batur Sunrise Hike - Mass Tour Version

The sunrise hike itself is beautiful - but the *mass group tour version* often means 100+ people shuffling up the trail with flashlights and being rushed to the summit.

**Why it’s a trap:** Overcrowded, often foggy, and not peaceful.

**Instead:** If you want to do it, book a **private or small group guide**, or skip sunrise and go for **sunset on Batur’s caldera rim**. Even better: [Mount Agung](https://mybalitrips.com/en/agung/?utm_source=reddit) **(for experienced hikers only).**

# 5. Ubud Monkey Forest

A beautiful spot, yes, but the monkeys have learned to steal phones, glasses, and snacks — and sometimes get aggressive.

**Why it’s a trap:** Crowded, full of poorly-behaved tourists, and not as relaxing as expected.

**Instead:** Visit **Sangeh Monkey Forest** (more peaceful) or just skip monkey encounters altogether.

# 6. Waterfalls Where You Pay for Every Staircase

Some waterfalls (like **Kanto Lampo** or **Tegenungan**) now charge for multiple “zones” - entry, camera access, changing area, etc. Gets annoying fast.

**Why it’s a trap:** Feels more like a theme park than nature.

**Instead:** Try **Tibumana**, **Nungnung**, or **Sekumpul** \- more natural, less hustle. Just bring good shoes.

# 7. “Cultural Shows” in Restaurants

Some touristy venues advertise Balinese dance shows with dinner — but often it's short, unauthentic, and overpriced.

**Why it’s a trap:** It's for tourists only and doesn’t reflect real temple dances.

**Instead:** See **Kecak dance at** [**Uluwatu Temple**](https://mybalitrips.com/en/uluwatu-kecak/?utm_source=reddit) at sunset, or **Legong performance at Puri Saren Palace** in Ubud for a real cultural experience (with proceeds often supporting the local village).

# 8. Airport SIM Card Vendors

They’ll sell you overpriced SIM cards “for tourists” with unnecessary packages.

**Why it’s a trap:** You’ll pay 2–3x the price of a local SIM.

**Instead:** Buy Telkomsel or XL at a local phone shop or even a Circle K. Better deals, same service.

# Final Tips

* **Do some planning** beyond Instagram - Bali is more than swings, temples, and smoothie bowls.
* **Get off the beaten path** \- check out **Sidemen**, **Amed**, **Pemuteran**, or **Munduk** if you want peace and authentic culture.
* **Talk to locals** \- they’ll often steer you to the best experiences you won’t find online.

Chapter 1



When Cassidy Morgan opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn at 27 years old.



At this point in her life, she had two children and was married to Gabriel Westbrook, the billionaire CEO who consistently topped the Forbes list and had been named ""The #1 Most Desirable Bachelor"" by TIME Magazine—a man so sought after that even the British royal family had once hoped to marry their princess to him.



Everyone told her how fortunate she was. Yet the first thing she did after this rebirth was bring divorce papers to his childhood sweetheart.



""I want a divorce,"" Cassidy said calmly, sliding the document across the table to Natalie Hayes. ""Gabriel is yours. The children too. All yours.""



Natalie stared at her in shock, unable to believe that the woman who had occupied the position of Mrs. Westbrook for six years would suddenly volunteer to step aside.



""Since they all prefer you anyway,"" Cassidy added with quiet resignation, ""I'll make it easy for everyone. Just get Gabriel to sign these papers. Once the cooling-off period ends, I'll be gone.""



This time, she refused to repeat her mistakes. She wouldn't continue being the invisible Mrs. Westbrook that everyone overlooked.



Natalie's fingers unconsciously traced the rim of her coffee cup as she frowned. ""What game are you playing, Cassidy?""



""No game,"" Cassidy replied evenly as she observed the shifting expressions on Natalie's face. ""I'm simply done.""



""Do you have any idea how many women would kill to be in your position?"" Natalie challenged.



""I do,"" Cassidy met her gaze directly. ""That's why I'm giving it to you.""



A crack finally appeared in Natalie's perfect façade.



She studied the divorce papers for a long moment before taking them. ""Well, if you're being so generous, I won't refuse.""



""Just remember,"" Natalie added, ""once I have something, I never give it back.""



""Don't worry,"" Cassidy smiled faintly. ""I absolutely won't regret this.""



After all, in her previous life, she had already tasted the bitterness of a lonely existence.



Natalie moved to another table and elegantly picked up her phone, her fingers dancing across the screen.



When the call connected, her voice instantly softened: ""Gabriel, I'm at Blue Mountain Café. Could you come pick me up?""



Cassidy sat nearby, a bitter smile playing on her lips.



There had been a time when she called Gabriel, only to have his assistant answer nine times out of ten.



Yet now, in less than twenty minutes, the man who was always ""in meetings"" appeared at the café entrance.



Through the glass window, Cassidy watched Gabriel stride in, his tailored black suit accentuating his broad shoulders and narrow waist.



Six-year-old Ethan and four-year-old Emma immediately spotted Natalie and rushed to her, hugging and kissing her affectionately.



""Auntie Natalie!"" Emma called sweetly, nuzzling her face against Natalie's.



Gabriel placed a cake box on the table, his long fingers gently pushing it forward. ""Matcha, your favorite. I had the chef reduce the sugar.""



Natalie's eyes lit up. ""You always remember the details.""



Cassidy sat in the corner, her fingers unconsciously digging into her palms.



In six years of marriage, Gabriel had never bothered to learn her preferences. In her previous life, when she was hospitalized and craved strawberry cake, he had his assistant buy one randomly—it turned out to be mango, which she was allergic to.



""What would you like for dinner?"" Gabriel asked, his deep voice smooth and refined. ""French cuisine or Italian?""



Natalie smiled coyly, pulling out the divorce papers from her purse. ""Before that, there's a document I'd like you to look at.""



She flipped to the signature page. ""I've found a house I love, but I'm short on liquid assets. Could you...?""



Gabriel took the pen and signed without even glancing at the content. ""Between us, why keep such formalities?""



""Is Auntie Natalie buying a new house?"" Ethan looked up and asked. ""Dad, you should buy one next door! Emma and I want to live with Auntie Natalie instead of staying with Mom all the time.""



Gabriel's brow furrowed slightly, but seeing the children's hopeful expressions, he relented. ""I'll arrange it.""



""No need to go to such trouble,"" Natalie quickly interjected. ""I'll reserve three rooms for Ethan, Emma...and you. You can visit whenever you want.""



The children cheered, and Emma even hugged Natalie's neck and planted a kiss on her cheek. ""Auntie Natalie is the best! A thousand times better than Mom!""



Witnessing all this, Cassidy felt as though an invisible hand was squeezing her heart, the bitterness and heaviness making it almost impossible to breathe.



She saw the slight upward curve of Gabriel's lips—a tenderness he had never shown her.



Unable to watch anymore, she grabbed her purse and left.



As she walked through the door, memories of her past life flooded back.



In her previous life, she had entered a business marriage with Gabriel, gave birth to two children, and lived until she was 62—yet never found happiness.



All because Gabriel's heart had always belonged to his college sweetheart, Natalie Hayes.



When they broke up years ago, Natalie went abroad. Gabriel drowned his sorrows in alcohol for days, but his pride prevented him from chasing her. Instead, he agreed to the arranged marriage their families had planned.



Gabriel had been Cassidy's girlhood dream—aristocratic, almost god-like. Which socialite in NY didn't dream of marrying the heir to the Westbrook empire?



So when she learned their families were arranging their marriage, she was ecstatic.



But after the wedding, though she poured all her love into their relationship, Gabriel remained distant and cold.



Until Natalie returned.



He never mentioned divorce to Cassidy, yet his gaze never left Natalie.



Worse still, the children also grew to prefer Natalie, gradually becoming distant from their mother.



In her later years, Cassidy was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Gabriel, using ""peaceful recovery"" as an excuse, abandoned her in their old mansion.



On her birthday, her trembling hands dialed her husband and children, only to learn they were vacationing with Natalie in the Maldives.



She tried to bake herself a birthday cake, but in her confused state, forgot to turn off the oven...



As flames engulfed her, Cassidy's final memory was of Gabriel's cold eyes as he placed the wedding ring on her finger.



She closed her eyes in agony, with one wish: if given another chance, she would never again sacrifice her life for him.



When Cassidy returned to the mansion, night had already fallen.



Instead of resting, she immediately began clearing out items—Gabriel's suits and shirts, the children's toys, family photos… everything went into cardboard boxes.



""What are you doing?"" Gabriel's voice suddenly came from behind her.



Cassidy turned to see him standing in the doorway with both children, his brow deeply furrowed.



""Why is Mom throwing away our things?!"" Emma rushed over, her face flushing red with anger when she saw her teddy bear being placed in a box.



Ethan glared at her furiously too. ""We were just hanging out with Auntie Natalie for a bit. Why are you being such a drama queen about it?""



Gabriel looked at her, his gaze cold as always. ""The kids prefer spending time with Natalie. Do you really need to throw a fit over something so trivial?""



""I'm not angry,"" Cassidy said calmly.



""Liar!"" Emma screamed. ""You're just jealous of Auntie Natalie! That's why you're throwing away my teddy bear. You're a terrible mother!""



""When I grow up, I'm moving in with Auntie Natalie,"" Ethan grabbed his sister's hand, spitting the words viciously. ""And I'll never come back to see you!""



Gabriel made no attempt to stop the children's outburst. He merely frowned slightly, his deep eyes sweeping dismissively over Cassidy—as if she were just an unreasonable stranger.



""Enough,"" his thin lips barely moved, his deep voice carrying an innate arrogance as his long fingers casually adjusted his cufflinks. ""I have a board meeting video call. Pack whatever you want, just keep it down.""



The moment the door closed behind him, Cassidy's tears finally fell. Her heart felt torn to pieces, each breath tasting of blood.



She wiped away her tears, looked at the mess scattered across the floor, and suddenly laughed.



Don't worry, she wouldn't disturb him—not now, not ever again.



Chapter 2



After signing the divorce papers, Cassidy stopped managing household chores.



No longer did she rise at 5 a.m. to prepare nutritious breakfasts for the children or stay up late making hangover soup for Gabriel after his business dinners.



All the duties she once considered her responsibility were now left to the servants.



At first, no one noticed the change.



Until Ethan was late for school and got scolded by his teacher, Emma couldn't find her homework notebook, and Gabriel's pocket watch stopped ticking.



The servants scrambled to keep up, yet couldn't match the hostess's standards.



Unwashed dishes piled in the kitchen, children's toys scattered across the living room, and pressed shirts were never quite smooth enough… the once-immaculate home gradually fell into disarray.



When Gabriel pushed open the bedroom door, Cassidy was leaning by the window, reading.



Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting dappled shadows over her.



""How long do you plan to continue this?"" he stood at the doorway, his voice low.



Cassidy closed her book and looked up at him. ""Continue what?""



""Why have you stopped taking care of the household?"" He stepped closer, the faint scent of ambergris lingering in the air. ""Are you still angry about what happened?""



""I'm not angry,"" she placed the book aside. ""I just don't want to do it anymore.""



Gabriel narrowed his eyes, his long fingers tapping on the table. ""Why?""



""I'm tired,"" she replied calmly. ""We have servants. I don't need to do everything.""



She recalled her previous life, rising before dawn every day.



Gabriel's coffee had to be exactly 85°C, his sandwiches toasted to golden perfection. The children's clothes required hand-washing, even their socks needed perfect pressing.



But what did it get her? Nothing but Gabriel's tenderness toward Natalie, the children's affection for ""Auntie Natalie,"" and ultimately, her lonely death alone in that mansion on her sixty-second birthday.



""Cassidy,"" his voice grew colder. ""If you're throwing a tantrum, just say so. Don't act like a three-year-old.""



She gave a slight smile. ""I'm not throwing a tantrum. I just need a break.""



Before he could respond, the door burst open.



Ethan and Emma charged in, their faces flushed with anger.



""Mom is so lazy!"" Emma shouted shrilly. ""We want Auntie Natalie to take care of us!""



Ethan joined in. ""Auntie Natalie is more loving, more hardworking, a million times better than you!""



Gabriel's gaze remained fixed on Cassidy, seemingly waiting for her to back down.



But she just took a deep breath and said quietly, ""If you think she's better, then invite her over. I don't mind.""



The air instantly froze.



And Gabriel's expression darkened completely.



""Are you sure?""



Cassidy took a deep breath. ""Absolutely.""



""Daddy, let's go!"" Emma tugged impatiently at Gabriel's sleeve. ""I want Auntie Natalie to come right now!""



""Now that we have Auntie Natalie, we don't need you anymore!"" Ethan made a face at Cassidy. ""You can leave this house!""



Gabriel gave Cassidy one last look. Seeing her unmoved, he turned and left with the children, his footsteps heavy.



Cassidy stood motionless, listening to the car engine fade into the distance, and slowly closed her eyes.



Soon, she would grant their wish—leaving them completely, leaving this house forever.



Chapter 3



Natalie moved in the very next day and immediately ordered the servants to redecorate the living room.



""This sofa is too somber,"" her slender fingers brushed over the leather, turning to Gabriel with a gentle smile. ""Gabriel, can we replace it with something in cream?""



Without even blinking, Gabriel instructed the butler: ""Do as Natalie says.""



Cassidy stood at the staircase landing, watching workers carry out the sofa she had carefully selected just six months ago.



Ethan and Emma followed Natalie like shadows, excitedly pointing at various items. ""Auntie Natalie, these pillows need to go too! Mom bought such ugly ones!""



Natalie stroked their heads affectionately. ""Alright, we'll change everything.""



Cassidy's fingers tightened momentarily before relaxing again.



Those pillows had been hand-stitched by her during pregnancy, filled with hypoallergenic down cotton specifically because the children had sensitive skin as babies.



Yet now they were unceremoniously tossed into the garbage.



In the following days, the house became increasingly unfamiliar.



At the dining table, Natalie sat in what had been Cassidy's place, tenderly serving food to the children.



Gabriel occasionally poured her coffee himself, his long fingers gently pushing the cup toward her, his eyes showing a softness Cassidy had never received.



In the evenings, the living room lights would dim, and the four would huddle on the sofa watching movies: Emma curled up in Natalie's arms while Ethan leaned against Gabriel's shoulder, their laughter constantly filling the room.



When Cassidy passed by, they wouldn't even glance at her, as if she were invisible.



More laughably, Gabriel, Ethan, and Emma had once been impossibly fastidious about their living standards.



But now?



She watched Natalie carelessly toss Gabriel's million-dollar Patek Philippe watch on the coffee table, face down, while he lovingly put it on without complaint. She saw the children happily wearing school uniforms that Natalie had simply thrown in the washing machine, collars still stained with yesterday's sauce. She watched Natalie pass off takeout as home-cooked meals, with none of them calling her out…



Even more absurd was how they pampered Natalie—



""Natalie, don't touch these chores,"" Gabriel stopped her from clearing the teacups, his long fingers gently pressing on her wrist. ""Your hands are meant for playing the piano.""



""Auntie Natalie, let me carry your bag!"" Ethan eagerly took her limited-edition handbag, his fawning expression something Cassidy had never seen on her son's face.



""Miss Hayes only needs to rest,"" the butler respectfully offered Italian handcrafted slippers. ""Leave everything to us.""



How ironic.



She had been the family's unpaid housekeeper for six years, completely taken for granted. Yet the moment Natalie arrived, she became the princess on a pedestal.



The servants whispered among themselves:



""The master is so good to Miss Hayes, I've never seen him treat Mrs. Westbrook that way.""



""The children adore her too. I bet this house will soon have a new hostess!""



Cassidy had already grown numb, no longer caring about anything, simply quietly packing her belongings.



Until that afternoon when her phone suddenly began vibrating frantically.



""Madam! Young Master and Miss have had an allergic reaction at school! An ambulance just took them to the hospital!""



When Cassidy arrived at the hospital, both children had been rushed to emergency.



Gabriel stood in the hallway, his suit jacket casually draped over his arm, his tie hanging loosely around his neck, cold fury simmering in his eyes.



""Cassidy,"" his voice was low, suppressing rage. ""What exactly are you doing?""



Cassidy was taken aback. ""What?""



""They're allergic to mango. You know that, right?"" Gabriel stepped closer, his tall figure looming over her. ""Why did you let them drink mango juice?""



""It wasn't me!"" Cassidy met his eyes. ""I never bring mango into the house.""



Ever since the children's first allergic reaction to mango landed them in the hospital, she had been incredibly vigilant—warning everyone repeatedly about their allergy, even personally reviewing the school cafeteria menus. How could she make such a basic mistake?



""Not you?"" Gabriel sneered. ""Then who? The servants? Or did they try to poison themselves?""



Cassidy opened her mouth to speak, but a nurse interrupted: ""The children are awake.""



In the hospital room, Ethan and Emma lay pale-faced in their beds. When they saw their parents enter, something flickered in their eyes.



""What happened?"" Gabriel demanded sternly.



The children exchanged glances, then simultaneously pointed at Cassidy: ""It's Mom! She bought snacks with mango!""



Cassidy froze, staring at them in disbelief. ""What are you saying?""

On our wedding anniversary, my husband insisted on inviting his entire crew of friends to celebrate with us","# What Each Chapter Reveals, How It Hit Me, and Where You Can Read Along

Chapter 1



On our wedding anniversary, my husband insisted on inviting his entire crew of friends to celebrate with us. Among them was a female ""bro"" I'd never seen before.



The moment she walked in, she plopped down directly on my husband's lap and starting a video call: ""Mom, I made it! Your godson is sitting right next to me.""



Then she turned and pressed her face close to his, practically nuzzling him: ""Well, Knox, if you ever treat me badly, I'll have both our families beat you up!""



Crack!



The glass I was holding slipped from my fingers, shattering on the floor.



In an instant, everyone's eyes were on me.



His female ""bro"" just arched one eyebrow:



""Hey, I was just joking around. You're not bothered by that, are you?""



The private room fell silent instantly—you could hear a pin drop.



I instinctively looked at Knox.



He just smiled and playfully tapped Piper's head, his tone affectionate: ""Today's my wedding anniversary with my wife. Don't be so wild.""



She pouted flirtatiously, naturally wrapping her arms around his neck: ""Fine. Since you're throwing this welcome-home party for me, I'll give you that much.""



By then, a server came in to clean up the broken glass and handed me a new cup.



Someone took the opportunity to ease the tension: ""Don't mind her, Riley. Piper's always been carefree—she doesn't mean any harm.""



I remained silent.



Piper glanced at me dismissively: ""Don't tell me you're actually this petty?""



After that, she released her hold on Knox and hopped off his lap: ""Guess I better keep my distance from you, Knox. So wifey doesn't throw a fit when you get home.""



Then she shook her head with a dramatic sigh, teasing the group of guys: ""Now you see why I don't hang out with women?""



""So damn dramatic and sensitive. It's exhausting.""



Nobody picked up her comment, and the atmosphere turned awkward.



Someone hesitantly spoke up: ""Piper, it's their anniversary today, maybe tone it down a bit...""



Suddenly Piper covered her mouth in mock realization: ""Oh my god, I almost forgot! I brought a gift!""



Then she pulled out a velvet jewelry box from her purse and presented it to Knox like a prized treasure: ""Ta-da!""



When she opened the box, inside lay a pair of gleaming gemstone cufflinks—men's cufflinks.



Someone politely gasped in admiration.



Knox smiled. ""You came all the way back home—I should be the one giving you gifts.""



Hearing this, Piper gave him a coy look and reached over to fasten them on his wrists.



As she moved, matching cufflinks on her own sleeves caught the light brilliantly.



""Hmph, I picked these out especially for you. You better appreciate them.""



Some people had already begun secretly glancing at my expression, but I just took a deep breath, my clenched fingers leaving crescent-shaped marks on my palm.



Then I stood up.



Knox frowned. ""Where are you going?""



I forced a smile. ""To book you two a hotel room.""



""Otherwise I'm afraid you'll do it right here.""



The moment I finished speaking, Piper violently smashed the empty jewelry box in her hand onto the floor.



She cursed loudly: ""What's fucking wrong with this chick?""



""I told you guys we should've just hung out with the bros.""



""Now she's completely ruined the mood!""



Knox chased after me, his tone urgent: ""Babe, Piper doesn't mean anything by it.""



""They're just cufflinks. She's always been casual like this—don't take it personally.""



""And what you said back there was way out of line...""



I gave him a cold smile. ""So the real reason you invited all your friends today was to celebrate your childhood sweetheart coming home, right?""



Knox shifted uncomfortably, avoiding my eyes. ""Why are you making such a big deal out of this?""



""Besides, our anniversaries are always just the two of us—that gets a bit dull.""



""I thought inviting more people would make it more fun.""



Seeing my expression darken, Knox grabbed my hand, his tone softening unusually: ""Babe, don't overthink this. Piper and I have known each other for years—if something was going to happen between us, it would have already.""



""And look, I chose to be with you, didn't I?""



I nearly laughed from anger: ""I'm so sorry for taking your childhood sweetheart's place.""



""Fine, I'll step aside.""



Knox's face flushed red as he yanked his hand away, his tone hardening: ""What are you talking about? You know that's not what I meant.""



""Riley, you're being completely unreasonable!""



With that, he stormed off without looking back.



But his footsteps gradually slowed. I knew he was waiting for me to compromise and follow him, just like I always had before.



I frowned, turned around and walked away.



This man is truly disgusting!



Chapter 2



Knox came home at three in the morning.



He was completely wasted, clothes disheveled, reeking of alcohol, stumbling as he tried to embrace me.



I frowned and dodged him, but he caught my wrist.



Next second, his boozy breath hit my face: ""Happy anniversary, babe. Look what I got you.""



He pulled a jewelry box from his pocket and opened it in front of me—it was the Graff Diamonds jewelry set I'd been eyeing for months.



But my eyes quickly fell on the two empty spots in the box.



Knox scratched his head sheepishly: ""Piper accidentally saw it, and she really liked the bracelet and ring. She insisted on taking them.""



""I figured you already have plenty of bracelets and rings, so I let her have them...""



When I didn't take it, he tried to force the box into my hands, his tone reassuring: ""Babe, don't be mad. If you really want them, I'll buy you another set, okay?""



Yet I just stepped back, letting the jewelry box clatter to the floor.



Knox paused, pressed his lips together to control his temper, then forced a smile: ""Babe, I was wrong today. I'm sorry.""



""I shouldn't have invited so many people on our anniversary. But look what I got!""



With that, he pulled out a small cherry cake from behind his back.



I stared at the cake, memories flooding back...



The day we got together, he had given me a cherry cake too.



Since then, we'd promised to celebrate every important occasion with cherry cake.



In that moment, fragments of everything we'd experienced together over the years flashed before my eyes.



I sighed and finally accepted it.



Fine. I'll forgive him one last time.



Seeing me unwrap the cake, Knox's face lit up with a huge smile.



As he fed me a bite, he cautiously began: ""Babe, Piper just got back and hasn't found an apartment yet...""



""She wants to stay with us for a few days. Is that okay?""



""She promised she won't cause you any trouble!""



The sickly sweet taste in my mouth suddenly made me nauseous.



I rushed to the bathroom and couldn't help throwing up.



Knox followed anxiously, patting my back: ""What's wrong? Babe.""



I forcibly pushed his hand away, went to the table and smashed everything on it.



I looked at him, my eyes red: ""Yes, she can stay!



""I'll go!""



Knox's expression instantly changed, his voice rising: ""What are you making a scene about now? I told you it's temporary! You're walking out over something this trivial?""



His contorted face reflected in my eyes, but this time, the light in my eyes had completely extinguished.



I shook my head and forced a bleak smile: ""Let's get divorced.""



Knox clearly hadn't expected me to say that.



He exploded with rage, violently kicking over the coffee table:



""Riley, are you fucking mental? You're really pushing it!""



Chapter 3



I locked myself in the master bedroom.



When Knox finished his shower and found the door wouldn't open, he pounded on it furiously before slinking off to the guest room.



The next morning, he sat at the breakfast table with a cold expression. The table was set with an elaborate breakfast.



I snickered.



Playing the silent treatment card? How pathetic.



I just gave him a cold glance and walked expressionlessly toward the front door.



Knox couldn't take it anymore: ""Riley, don't be so goddamn ungrateful!""



""You were wrong yesterday too. You shouldn't throw around divorce as an empty threat.""



Without looking back, I replied flatly: ""I'm serious. Start preparing for it.""



After I closed the door, I heard dishes shattering inside.



...



By the time I reached the office, my emotions had completely settled.



My work efficiency remained as high as ever. Almost no one could tell I was having relationship troubles.



During a meeting, my boss announced: ""We have an international order that requires someone to travel to British for a month.""



""If anyone's interested, contact me. The company will cover all expenses, plus a travel allowance.""



At that moment, messages from Knox popped up one after another on my phone screen. I irritably turned off the phone and said loudly: ""I can go.""



After the meeting, a close colleague stopped me, sounding puzzled: ""Riley, what about your husband while you're gone for a month?""



I replied nonchalantly: ""Oh, he has his childhood sweetheart to keep him company. He won't be lonely.""



Hearing my words, my colleague realized they'd said something wrong and awkwardly shut up.



When I got home that evening, I found an unfamiliar suitcase in the entryway.



Bright pink, covered with random stickers.



I took off my heels only to discover someone had taken my house slippers.



My expression darkened immediately.



Walking barefoot a few steps forward, I heard flirtatious laughter: ""Wow, Knox! Your cooking has really improved since I last saw you!""



Piper was wearing my cherry slippers, eating with oil dripping down her chin.



In her hands were clearly my plate and fork.



Seeing me approach, Piper seemed startled: ""Oh! shit, how do you walk so silently? You could've said something—you just scared me!""



""Knox, you're even more jumpy than I am. Must be rough getting scared by your wife every day, huh?""



Without wasting a single word, I stepped forward and slapped her across the face twice, hard and loud.



Then I threw the dishes on the table to the floor.



Piper was stunned by the slaps at first, then immediately exploded: ""You fucking bitch! You dare hit me?!""



Knox heard the commotion and rushed out from the kitchen, grabbing the raging Piper.



She twisted in his arms: ""Knox, did you see that? Has your wife lost her mind? She hit me the second she walked in!""



""How can you stand this psycho? Why are you holding me back? Hit her back for me!""



Knox's face darkened as he yelled at me: ""Riley, what the hell is wrong with you? Apologize right now!""



I curled my lips into a smile: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. I couldn't see clearly.""



""I just saw some woman wearing my slippers, using my dishes—I thought she was a thief.""



Piper's face flushed red, looking somewhat guilty: ""I didn't know they were yours...""



But she was obviously lying.



I love cherries—almost everything of mine at home has a cherry symbol on it. If she accidentally wore my slippers, that would be understandable, but to also use my plates, my forks? Too many coincidences? Only a fool would believe she wasn't doing it deliberately.



Seeing that I'd apologized, her expression changed.



She nestled softly in Knox's arms, showing her reddened cheek and tearful eyes: ""I'm sorry, Riley. Even if it was an accident, I shouldn't have touched your things...""



I raised an eyebrow.



Well, well. A professional damsel in distress.



But Knox was clearly falling for it.



He soothingly patted Piper's shoulder, then frowned at me: ""Riley, you've really gone too far this time.""



Then he helped Piper to the guest room to treat her face.

I just published the first episode of a new *“Server-Side Tracking for Shopify Merchants”* series:

**▶️ Video (13 min):** Client-Side vs Server-Side Tracking on Shopify – Explained Clearly:  
  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPY0I\_Jj-s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPY0I_Jj-s)

**Why it might be worth your coffee break:**

* **Cuts through the buzzwords.** Quickly explains what *actually* changes when you pipe events through a server, and why you still need browser-side tracking for attribution.
* **Hybrid reality > either/or debate.** Shows a practical split of which events belong client-side (page views, add-to-cart) and which are safer server-side (checkout steps, purchase).
* **Covers GA4, Meta CAPI, TikTok Events API.** No Shopify-Plus-only hacks – works for regular stores too.
* **Zero sales pitch.** It’s educational first; my tool (Analyzify) isn’t mentioned until the outro.

**Looking for feedback & discussion**

* Did anything surprise you about the limitations of pure server-side setups?
* If you’ve already tried GA4 Measurement Protocol or Meta CAPI, what tripped you up?
* Topics you’d like us to dig into next (consent, multi-domain setups, etc.)?

Appreciate any thoughts, questions, or constructive roasting. 😅  
Hope it helps some of you tighten up your tracking!

I have lots of visitors, and in this case, I often make dark roast for them. And to make a better coffee for them, I started studying more about dark roast.

My question is how to choose a dark roast bean that I'm seeking for.

In my memory, with some random beans that I don't even remember the names and info, I've made two types of dark roast coffee taste like below. Both were Zp6+v60 classic 4:6 recipes.

Coffee 1: bold, thick body, very very smooth like you added creamer level. No beaterness.

Coffee 2: very strong dark roast burnt flavor but very very very clean texture like you drink water.


What kinda bean should I find to make these taste coffee again? I don't think it's a recipe problem cuz I failed making these flavors again with many beans with many recipes for last two months.

Or throw me any thoughts or recommendations.

1lku4k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lku4k8/i_work_on_a_space_station_and_something_is_wrong/,I work on a space station and something is wrong with the crew (Part 1),"I work on the newest space station, called ""Laika,"" after the Soviet dog that died on a rocket. At first, I liked the name and the idea of immortalizing the poor animal, but now I think it's kind of prophetic. 

The mission started two months ago, and at first, everything seemed normal. We are a team of experienced astronauts from different nations — ten men and five women. Our station is bigger and higher up than the ISS, so it can hold more people. We are supposed to stay on the station for five years — longer than anyone ever has. NASA, working with a few other countries, wants to see how well human bodies can adapt to space conditions for long periods of time. One day, our research might help with missions to other planets or perhaps even colonization. This is the official purpose of our mission. There’s another task we were given, which is a bit more secretive. The station is equipped with newer, stronger technology that can send and receive signals from space. They still hope to hear from faraway civilizations. 

We all got to know each other before the mission and spent months training together. All of us had been on the ISS before, so the adaptation process seemed simple. There was a lot of work, like maintenance and daily reports back to Earth, but overall, our life was simple, almost peaceful. 

Everything changed on a random Friday of the third week. I was working with the “Long-Distance Communication Array,” which we jokingly called “Ray.” I was in the room with Greg Swanson, a 45-year-old American engineer who was the most skeptical about the existence of extraterrestrial life. He had spent his entire life working for NASA and believed that if aliens did, in fact, exist, we would have already known about them. But he was the best in his field, and the pay was good, so he agreed to go on the mission. All the money was being sent to his wife and four children. Usually we ran all the waves we received through sonification process. We were listening to the usual silence through “Ray” until… 

BOOM 

The sound was so loud I had to cover my ears. I felt like the echoes were bouncing inside my brain, causing a strong headache. Greg and I stared at each other in disbelief for a few seconds, then went back to “Ray.” Humans had received what they thought were signals from outer space civilisations before, but soon we learned that those were stars exploding or black holes expanding. This sound was something entirely different. It wasn’t like any signal we had received before — the system couldn’t even tell its frequency.

We called our teammates. It didn’t matter what they were doing — they all stopped midway and joined us in the Signal Room. Nothing was more important than this. We saved the recording and sent it back to Earth as soon as we could. Whatever it was, it could be the biggest discovery of our century. We could come back as heroes. But honestly, I couldn’t care less about that. We might be the first people ever to come in contact with extraterrestrial life. That thought sent shivers down my spine. 

We spent the evening celebrating. There’s no alcohol on the station, but the excitement everyone shared made me feel drunk. We kept talking and laughing and coming up with potential explanations of what the signal might be. There was a feeling of victory and almost childlike curiosity about the unknown. Now both we and the scientists back on Earth had a tough job of trying to decipher the signal.

Our team had three Signal Processing Specialists — 33-year-old Maria Smirnova from Russia, 40-year-old Oliver Allen from the UK, and 25-year-old Mia Gonzales from the US. Mia was the youngest on our team, yet extremely intelligent. All three had experience in analyzing signals from outer space and the deep ocean, yet none of them had any idea what ours meant.

“When we receive signals from a giant star, for example, we can tell almost everything”, Maria explained to me as we were having lunch in the cafeteria block. “We can tell how far away it is, what is happening, and when it happened. This is something completely different. Our computers have no idea. When I'm listening to it, it's like I feel vibrations in my entire body”.

Two weeks went by, and nothing really happened since. There were no more signals that “Ray” could detect, and the team still had no idea what ours could mean or where it could have come from. We were trying our best, but the excitement was slowly dying down. It still felt normal, but not as peaceful as before. Something was changing on the station, and I could feel it. 

One day, I was working with Chen in the control room. He was a 32-year-old Chinese engineer with a kind smile and a quirky sense of humor. The guy was never serious, and if you met him in a bar, you'd think he was an unemployed party animal still living with his parents, but the man was a genius.

We were doing a routine check of life support systems when suddenly I felt a piercing sharp pain in my forehead. It felt like someone put a giant needle through my brain, and now it was about to explode. Everything inside my head was hot and pulsating. I couldn’t sit straight and instinctively put my hand to my head. 

“Are you okay?” Chen’s voice sounded like he was talking from a different dimension. Everything went blurry for a second, and then I managed to focus my eyes. 

“Yes… No… I mean,” the words wouldn’t come out of my mouth. “I don’t know. I just had such a strong headache. I think it’s getting better.” 

“You wanna go to the doctor’s block?” 

“No, it’s… it’s fine.” I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it.

Chen brought me some water. The headache went away as quickly as it started, so we went back to the life support systems. Chen was my favorite person to work with. He always made me laugh and never acted like the smartest person in the room, even though he probably was one. 

I tried not to think much about the incident, but it still bothered me. I’ve never experienced migraines, but my mom did. I remember her lying down on the couch with her palm to her forehead, and my dad would bring her painkillers. She used to take a lot of them, otherwise, she couldn’t even focus. 

Sometimes she would skip work because of migraines, and one day she couldn’t come to my school play. I was hurt, so dad had to explain to me what a migraine was. As for me, though, I’ve never had them. I was always a healthy and athletic child, which eventually helped me get into a space program. I valued my health, and now this? I began to worry that my mom’s genetics had kicked in because of my age or long space missions. I really hoped it wasn’t the case, and well, I soon learned it wasn’t.

There were two doctors on board, and they were working overtime. Every day, several people would come to complain about headaches. It would be normal if one or two astronauts had this problem, but all of us? A bunch of experienced space travelers? Helen, the doctor from the US, tried her best to help us with pills and breathing exercises, but the results were always temporary. Her Russian colleague, Igor, was freaking out. They couldn’t figure out what was causing the headaches. The doctors measured our body temperature and blood pressure. We even went through the CT scanners we had on the station. Nothing was out of the ordinary. 

By the next week, it wasn’t just headaches. I couldn’t fall asleep no matter how hard I tried. I would lay down in bed with nothing but thoughts that wouldn’t stop. I wanted to shout at my own brain, “SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP!” When I did fall asleep, it was only for a few hours. I would wake up even more tired than before. Everyone was going through it, and we couldn’t ignore it. It was only our 6th week, and we were not the type of people to crack inside a fully equipped station. None of us had even left “Laika” once. Something was wrong. We assumed it was the oxygen tanks or the food and water supply. That was our best guess; all the other systems on board were perfectly normal. In space, it’s usual to have some sort of problem with engines or control blocks, but there weren’t any. Everything worked like clockwork, yet we all felt miserable. We took turns checking the equipment on a daily basis, ran lab tests on our food supply, but still, there was no answer. The doctors sent our health reports back to Earth for analysis and anxiously waited for a response. We tried our best to stay positive, but it was hard.

One day, I think it was a Thursday, I went to the cafeteria by myself. Everyone else was either working or desperately trying to finally fall asleep. As I got closer to the entrance, I heard voices. It was Greg, the American engineer, and his countrymen Michael and Jessica, both programmers.

“They’re poisoning us, I’m telling you,” Michael’s voice sounded nervous and secretive.

“I don’t get it, Michael. They’re doctors, why would they do that?” Jessica sounded nervous too, but more in a confused way.

“Listen, I’ve worked with you before. I’ve never worked with these people. Helen doesn’t even seem like a doctor. She told me to meditate. And that Russian guy… You know he worked for the FSB, right? Before he became an astronaut. I don’t trust this dude”.

""How are they doing it?"" Greg sounded as authoritative and skeptical as usual.
""They’re the only ones running tests in the lab, right?""

""Well, they're the best at chemistry.""

""Which gives them an advantage. How do you know the results they give us aren't tampered with?""

I entered the cafeteria. The heavy metal door slammed shut with a loud noise. All three people turned and stared at me. I’m not sure how long it lasted, but their gaze made me uncomfortable.

“Hey, Mira,” Michael quickly switched from his conspiracy-theorist tone to his usual upbeat voice. “Hungry?”

“Yeah, I’m starving and could really use some coffee,” I replied, trying to make my voice sound as casual as I could.

“Sure, let me make you some.”

I waited at the table as Michael was making my coffee and opening a package of food. The atmosphere during the meal was extremely awkward, and we all rushed to leave once we were done.

The experience made me question reality. Every astronaut knows: no matter what, you do not bring drama to a space station. You are stuck with just a few people on a piece of metal, hundreds of kilometers away from home. If you start going against each other, you’re done. Michael’s accusations were insane. Igor wasn’t necessarily my friend, but I knew him. He’s a great doctor, and he’s from my country. We had been on a mission together once, and he was nothing but helpful. I wasn’t sure if I should tell him what I’d heard. I didn’t want to create more tension, but I also didn’t want Igor to become a scapegoat.

Meanwhile, our symptoms were only getting worse. By week seven, no one could sleep more than an hour a day. Honestly, we felt lucky to even get that one hour. The migraines made everyone grumpy and easily irritated. Some of us began to have regular nosebleeds, and Hiroshi, the Japanese technician, was bleeding from his eyes. We sent an emergency request to get back to Earth for treatment. The reply took an unusually long time to arrive. When it finally came, I almost wished it hadn’t. The brief message read:

“The risk of mass infection is too high. Return is impossible. Must continue the mission.”

1lku45e,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1lku45e/my_money_doesnt_feel_like_mine/,My money doesn't feel like mine.,"For context, 
I'm 23F and work a part time job. started part time 3 days a week for school but wouldn't have the option of full time due to working for a cheap company.
I have only been working for about 6-7 months now due to being severely held back from any opportunities to do such sooner.
I had worked a part time seasonal job a few months prior that helped me be able to start up this new one thankfully otherwise I'd have nothing for transportation as I currently don't drive yet.
(Seasonal job coworker had given me rides for previous job and I'd pay them)
I make roughly around 300$ each week if I don't work overtime.
Majority of the time my money strictly goes towards my transportation, energy drinks at work, and I try to get whatevers left into my savings. 

Now here's where the problem is.
My mom automatically assumes I will pay for her things because I have any money AT ALL not taking into consideration that it's money I earned, for me, and put towards things that I find necessary.
She will ask me to buy her cigarettes, Coffee, and other random things on occasion.
Now these things might sound small, but she will ask for these things every other day and only pay me back or give me money to get them 2/5 times and when she does give me money, she'll purposely give me the incorrect amount (sometimes more, sometimes less) either to sneak money out of me or to hold above my head that she gave me ""extra"" next time she needs something so she doesn't have to send more even if she hadn't paid me back for times previously that had caused me to land short on money for work.
These things aren't cheap, I can't afford to spend 50$+ on just coffee and cigarettes 1-2 times a week depending if she adds another random thing to the mix.
I cant just tell her I don't have money without her accusing me of lying (whether I am or not shouldn't matter for money I make) but I don't want what could be savings to help myself in the future be wasted away on cigarettes and coffee.
A huge problem is I also have to completely keep any idea of me having savings at all free from her knowledge otherwise she'd act like I'm rich and have all the money in the world to spoil her for more beyond just her usual order.
If I strictly just say no, it'll be a shit show so that's certainly no option but I try my best to use the excuse of ""I only have enough money for work"" as much as I can however she'll even try to push that back with saying she'll pay me back but a good majority of the time she doesn't and I hate the idea of having to beg her for my own money back for when I am actually low.
Don't get me wrong, I know she does let me live with her for free but I'm telling you in full honesty it's only because she's BUILT IT THAT WAY. I have only relied on her because she's forced me into that position and I almost feel as though asking me to buy her things is part of trying to set that up further.
She keeps trying to encourage me to go full time at my job and I just keep having to explain 
As to why I can't but part of me wouldn't even want to if I could because I feel like the reality is if I make more money, that's more for her to take from me.
She's actively acted as though I'm selfish or withholding my own damn money from her if she sees me wear something ""new"" (something I just don't wear often or a single article of clothing I finally encouraged myself to buy) and it's very annoying to be made to feel bad for spending my own money on myself...or even save it for myself.

I really don't know how to combat this because I feel like I won't be able to hide my money from her forever and I hate this fear of having it in the first place.
I shouldn't feel selfish being responsible with my own money.
For some context about my mom's situation, she currently is living off of social security (so she has the money to send for the things she asks me for but avoids doing so anyway) and food stamps for my siblings and is ""disabled"" which results in her being unable to work so any dime she can save is more for her to spend on something stupid.
She only just recently started receiving social security and already we've had multiple Amazon boxes at our door of random crap like a 200$ gold ring she just so needed to have.
Mind you, she would have literally lost her house if it weren't for this social security to hit so she could pay it out of foreclosure.
She has no sense of responsibility or maturity when it comes to money which has been proven repeatedly and I don't want that to bleed onto me but she makes me feel so cornered in the fact that if I say no, suddenly I'm villianized for the fact that she's simply had to support me as her child.
Even after the age of 18, I couldn't help myself because she didn't set me up to be able to so I've been completely set up to rely on her no matter what direction I go.
There was even a time where I activately tried leaving the house after me and her got into an argument and she told me I needed to find a new place but once I told her I'd leave that night and did just that, she was calling and screaming with threats before I could even make it to where I was going.
So if I stay, I'm a problem she has to support. 
But if I leave, then she's just mad I wasn't scared enough to just act how she wanted me to and actually was willing to leave.

There's no middle grown for me to go here and I'm entirely unsure if what to do.
I want to keep my money, save up, and be responsible with it but if I say no to her then it's just an argument of her supporting me previously and me being ungrateful.. but regardless I can't get away if I can't help myself.

If there's any advice, please send it my way! I need any excuse or reason I can get that will get her to leave me alone and not cause an argument.

I have every right to have my own money and I'm sick for fighting for it.

# Book 1: Chapter 1

Chapter One: Confirmation

Tennessee “Tenn” Aston sat across from Ron Parker, an old friend and private investigator he hired to follow his wife in front of the Tatte Bakery and Cafe in Boston. After they spent a few minutes catching up, Tenn got to the point. “So, what did you find?”

“She's having an affair, sorry.” Ron pushed the file across the table at him. “Guy's name is Joel Hudson. He's a salesperson at the dealership.” Tenn flicked through the pictures, his heart sinking as he saw proof his wife was sleeping with another man.

“Well, if I didn't think it was possible, I wouldn't have hired you.” Tenn passed over the check for his services. It was money well spent because, in his opinion, the contents of the folder were priceless.

“I, uh, did some extra digging, no cost.” Ron passed over another file. “The guy is married. His wife is the head librarian at the Boston University Visual Arts Resource Library. She either knows and doesn't care or is even more in the dark than you were.” Tenn opened the file and saw the man his wife was cheating on him with, looking down at an attractive woman with long, thick, fire-engine-red hair. She laughed at him as they walked, his arm around her shoulders as he kissed her cheek. Tenn was sure he knew her from somewhere but couldn't put his finger on where. “I took that picture two days ago. I don't think she knows.”

“You think I should tell her?” Tenn sighed as he contemplated that confrontation. “I don't know what I want to do about this.”

Ron leaned forward, a cryptic expression on his face. “Tenn, how long have we been friends?”

“I don't know. Ten, fifteen years?” Tenn shrugged. “What does that have to do with anything?”

“Have I ever steered you wrong? Trust me. Tell her.”

Tenn studied her picture again. Why did she look so familiar? Making up his mind, he nodded. He'd want her to tell him. “Thanks, Ron. I will.” He stood up to leave. “Grab a beer when you get back?”

“Absolutely.”

\\----------

Tenn stood in front of Boston University's Library of Visual Arts. It was almost closing time, and he was hesitant to enter, find Joel Hudson's wife, and tell her that her husband was cheating on her with his wife. Adjusting his glasses, he ran his hand through his thick, black hair. He would want to know. He tightened his hand on the folder and went in to find her.

He approached the resources desk, and a woman around his age with bubble-gum pink hair cheerfully greeted him. “Hi, can I help you?”

“Yeah, I'm looking for a Quinn Hudson. She's a librarian here.”

“No librarians with the last name Hudson. You must mean Quinn Turner.”

“Uh, she has bright red hair.” Even her name was familiar, but he still couldn't figure out why.

“Yeah, that'll be Quinn Turner. Just a second.” She picked up a phone and hit a button. “Hey Jake, where's Quinn right now?” She listened for a second, eyeing him curiously as she drummed her fingers absently on the desk. “Thank you!” She drew the “you” out, then hung up and smiled at him. “Quinn's on the third floor. Take a right when you get off the elevator, go down the hall, and she should be in the first room on the left.”

“Thanks.” When Tenn got off the elevator, he followed the directions and came to a large room full of shelves of large books of photography and artwork prints. Quinn Turner between a cart of more books, and a table, sorting them into piles. He cleared his throat to get her attention, and she looked up, smiling at him.

“Hi, looking for something in particular?” Tenn blinked. The photograph didn't do her justice. The red hair was definitely not natural, but it suited her perfectly; her smile was warm and welcoming, and she had a full bottom lip made for biting and a perfect cupid's bow top lip. Her eyes were emerald green and framed by dark lashes. He swallowed. Immediate attraction. Fuck, he was going to kill Ron. He knew what he was doing by sending him here.

Realizing he was staring; he swallowed again and cleared his throat. “Yeah, we need to talk.”

Quinn raised a dark, arched eyebrow. “We do? Do we know one another?”

“No.” Tenn shook his head. “My name is Tennessee Aston -”

“From the Museum of Fine Arts?” Her eyes brightened as she interrupted, looking excited. “You got my email?”

“I'm sorry; you emailed me?” Tenn was thrown off and blinked in confusion. Did she already know and was trying to reach him?

“Yeah, I'm trying to put together a series of lectures by people in the Visual Arts community. You're the foremost art historian on the East Coast! I wanted a meeting to see if I could convince you to speak.” She looked him up and down. “You look different on your book jacket.”

“The stylist played up the stuffy English professor-look for that.” Tenn nodded and smiled, understanding why she wouldn't have recognized him. At six-two, with broad shoulders, he was wearing jeans, a T-shirt, and a hoodie under his black leather jacket instead of the dress shirt and tweed jacket he had been put in. He wore horn-rimmed glasses, but his black hair was longish, wavy, and messy, not combed down and professionally styled. He knew he looked more like a nerdy biker than an art historian, something the stylist said would make people not take him seriously.

“No kidding.” Quinn chuckled. “If that's not why you're here, why are you looking for me?”

The smile fell from his face as he remembered what he had come to talk about. Doing it at her place of work seemed wrong, so he decided to meet her somewhere neutral. “Can I buy you a drink?”

“A drink?” She bit her bottom lip, and Tenn found himself fighting the urge to do the same. Where the hell was this coming from?

“Yeah.” Mentally shaking himself, Tenn held up the folder. “We have something important to discuss, and I need a drink.”

“Okay. Meet you at Audubon in twenty minutes?” There was evident curiosity on her face about what he wanted to discuss.

“See you there.” Tenn nodded.

\\----------

Thirty minutes later, Tenn watched as Quinn walked into Audubon and looked around, spotting him in a quiet corner booth; she walked over and slid across from him. “Sorry, Rilla was curious about you, and I just got away.”

“Rilla?” Tenn raised his eyebrow.

“Girl with pink hair.” Quinn grinned at him as the bartender called out and asked if she wanted her regular; she turned around and waved at the woman. “Yes, please and thank you, Denise.” She called back.

“Come here a lot?” Tenn asked when she faced him again.

“Best food on campus. So, Mr. Aston, what did we need to talk about?”

“Tenn, please. You're married to Joel Hudson?”

“Yeah, you want to talk about Joel?” Quinn furrowed her brow as Denise put her drink in front of her, and she thanked her before taking a sip. Tenn decided to just show her the proof rather than try to explain things.

“No. I don't want to talk about him; we have to talk about him and my wife.” He pushed the folder across the table. She opened it, and he watched as her face dropped. With every picture, resignation slowly settled on her features, and she leaned back in the booth when she was done.

“Well. I want to say I'm surprised, but since I just gave him an ultimatum to either prove he wanted our marriage to work by putting in some effort or get out, I'm not.” She closed the folder and looked up at him. “When was the last time they were together?”

“According to my PI, last weekend.”

“He told me he was at a conference in New York.”

“The conference was real. They shared a hotel room.” Tenn was alarmed as a red flush rose up her neck and spread across her cheeks.

“Fucking Prick.” She spit out, then looked remorseful. “Him, not you.”

“I figured.” Tenn smiled apologetically. “I can get you copies of everything.”

“Please. Would you be interested in revenge and messing with them before we end things?” She smiled wickedly and leaned toward him, and Tenn found himself mirroring her posture before what she said registered in his brain.

That gave Tenn pause. He felt frozen and numb since he saw the evidence. They had been married for eleven years; finding out she was cheating after losing her job at an upscale hotel and taking two years off to “discover” herself on his dime while he had done his best to be supportive was a kick to the guts. She started working at the Porsche dealership after he finally pushed her to return to work when he had to move money over from his savings to pay the bills. Viki had been resentful about everything initially, but after two months, she warmed up to the job and was more cheerful at home.

“What did you have in mind?”

“You and your wife should come to dinner tomorrow evening to discuss your participation in my lecture series. We should hit it off and become fast, close friends.” Her mischievous smile and sparkling eyes drew Tenn in, but he still wasn't convinced.

“You really think they'd care?” Tenn said doubtfully.

“Maybe, maybe not. But we can have fun and make it awkward by doing double dates.” Quinn smirked.

“What's your address?” Tenn made a contact for her on his phone and handed it to her. He was willing to do whatever he could to get back at Viki for doing this to him. Quinn grinned at him, took his phone, added her information, and sent herself a text to add his number to hers.

“Tomorrow at six?”

“Sounds good to me. Do you want to tell me about your lecture series? So I know what you're talking about tomorrow?”

Quinn nodded and explained her thought process and idea. When she was finished, Tenn found himself interested in it. “You know, if you want help with this, I'd be happy to. I know a few people who would be interested in talking and helping out.”

“Really?” A delighted smile spread across Quinn's face.

“Yeah, I think this sounds like an excellent idea.” Tenn nodded enthusiastically. “I'll make some phone calls, send some emails and see who I can get in touch with. How many speakers did you want?”

“Six weeks, so six speakers?”

“Not a problem.”

Chapter Two: It Begins

Tenn

“We've been invited out for dinner tonight with a colleague of mine.” Tenn looked up from his laptop as his wife came into the kitchen where he was working. It was past noon, and she just hauled herself out of bed after not getting home until well after midnight.

“I already have plans with Annie.” Viki yawned as she went to the coffee pot. “Why didn't you come to bed last night?”

“Fell asleep on the couch.” Tenn shrugged and reached for his phone. “No problem, I'll let Quinn know it's just me.”

“Quinn?” Viki looked up, frowning. “You've never mentioned a Quinn.”

“She works at the University in the Visual Arts Library. We're working on a project together.” He smiled. “We'll be working together a lot over the next six months, and she wanted me to meet her husband, so I figured you should meet her.”

“Oh. I see. Well, a little more heads up would have been nice.” She poured herself a cup of coffee and went to the fridge for cream, seemingly okay with it since Quinn was married.

“You were out most of last night. I didn't think you'd be going out again.” Tenn fought against the urge to roll his eyes. Quinn had texted him earlier that Joel never got home until midnight, so he was pretty sure Viki wasn't with Annie.

“Annie has been going through a lot. She thinks Tim is cheating.” Viki sipped her coffee and met his eyes without flinching, and Tenn had to admire her audacity.

“Huh, well, if she wants to find out, I know a great PI.” Tenn went back to his email. He was trying to contact several friends who worked in various artistic mediums for the lecture series, and it was a much more pleasant task than talking to her.

“You do?” Tenn watched from under his lashes as Viki tensed up. “Why do you know a PI?”

“Because he's an old friend,” Tenn explained, enjoying her discomfort. “He doesn't charge that much for unfaithful spouses. His wife cheated on him, so he despises them. Sometimes, he'll even do it for free. Tell Annie to get in touch with me, and I'll give her his number.”

“Yeah, I'll let her know.” Viki left the kitchen, and Tenn watched her go. He couldn't wait for tonight, if only because he was looking forward to spending more time with Quinn.

\\----------

A few hours later, Tenn was playing a video game in his gaming room/office when Viki came in looking sulky. “Annie had to cancel. So, I guess I'll go to dinner with you.”

“Oh, okay.” Tenn frowned as he paused the game. “Let me text Quinn to let her know.” He sent the text and snorted at her almost immediate response, shaking his head with a smile.

“How long have you known this person?” Viki raised her eyebrow as she watched him.

“Met her yesterday. She contacted me to see if I'd be a guest speaker at a series of lectures she's putting together. We got a drink together, talked about it, and I offered to help her with it.”

“You offered?” If her eyebrows got any higher, they would disappear into her hairline.

“Yeah, I liked the idea.” Tenn nodded as he turned his attention back to the game and went through the save process.

“So, what time did you get home last night?” Viki asked, clearly trying to feign nonchalance. Funny, she'd never cared about his activities when she was out before.

“What does that matter? You didn't get home until after midnight, and I was home before you.” Tenn closed his laptop. “There's gonna be lots of late nights with her. We're working on this after hours.” He stood up and stretched. “Be ready to go for five-thirty.”

“And if I have a problem with you being out late like that?”

“Get over it?” Tenn raised his eyebrow. “I had to.” Viki started to say something, but Tenn walked out of the room. He was ready to burn this marriage to the ground.

Quinn

Quinn was making a garlic cheese loaf to go with her homemade spaghetti sauce and meatballs when Joel came in, sniffing appreciatively. “Hey, Babe, what are you doing?”

“Making spaghetti and meatballs with a garlic loaf and Caesar Salad for dinner. We have guests coming.” Quinn smiled at him over her shoulder, a feat she could only accomplish by thinking about putting a fork in his eye. He hadn't come home until midnight but had crawled into bed and cuddled her, murmuring he loved her and was sorry he was out so late. She pretended to be asleep, and when he started to snore, she slipped out of bed and slept in the spare room.

“Oh. I wish you had told me earlier; it's poker night with the guys.” Joel smiled apologetically.

“Don't worry about it. I'll text Tenn and tell him he doesn't have to bring his wife now.”

“Who's Tenn?” Joel's smile immediately disappeared; to her surprise, she saw jealousy cross his features.

“He is an Art Historian at the Museum of Fine Arts who is helping me with my visual arts series. I originally just wanted him as a speaker, but after I met him for a drink yesterday, he offered to help me with it.” She smiled happily. A cute Art Historian, she amended in her head, who I'm looking forward to spending a lot of time with.

“Why wouldn't he bring his wife?” Joel asked, looking a little upset.

“Well, if you're not gonna be here, then we'll just turn it into a meeting for the two of us. We're going to be working very closely and outside of our regular hours for the next six months, and we wanted you guys to know who we're going to be spending our time with.” She shrugged. “You know, keep everything transparent.”

“Right. Well, I guess I can skip poker night then.”

“No, I insist. Go.” She patted his arm as she walked by. “It'll be boring for you.” She smiled faintly as he sputtered.

“No. I'm supposed to show you I'm serious about the relationship, remember? This is important to you, so I'll stay home. Just let me text Harry to let him know.” Joel pulled out his phone and began to type.

“Okay, Joel, thank you.” Quinn's phone chimed a few minutes later, and she picked it up quickly, grinning when she saw Tenn's text.

Viki was going out for a girl's night until a few minutes ago. She said her friend cancelled

Funny, Joel just cancelled his poker night when I said you'd be coming over alone.

“Who are you texting?” Joel interrupted. Quinn looked up to see him frowning as he watched her.

“Tenn.” She clicked the button to lock her phone and put it in her pocket. “He was just confirming the address.”

“What time will they be here?”

“Six. Could you run to the liquor store and pick up a couple of bottles of wine, please?” Quinn turned her back and rolled her eyes. He was such a hypocrite, jealous about Tenn but was fucking another woman. It was going to take a lot of willpower to do this, but she needed to make sure she had her ducks in a row before she blew everything up.



# Book 1: Chapter 3

Chapter Three: The Dinner Party

When Tenn pulled up to the house and parked in Quinn's driveway, Viki got out of the car slowly, looking apprehensive. “What are we doing here?”

“This is Quinn's house. Why?”

“Oh...” She looked more than a little flustered now. “I must be confused. I thought my co-worker lived here, but it must be another house.”

“Huh.” Tenn smiled to himself; they were in an area of Brookline where the houses were a little older, and Quinn's house had a more updated look to it; there was no way she was confused. “This is the address she gave me.” He walked up to the door and rang the bell. A minute later, Quinn opened the door, wearing an adorable, knee-length green sundress with a pink floral pattern, empire waist, and bell sleeves that perfectly showed off her gorgeous figure. She smiled at him warmly, looking absolutely delighted to see him.

“Tenn. Hi!” She stepped back so they could come in.

“Hey, Quinn. This is my wife, Viki.” Tenn introduced them, watching closely to see if Viki showed any sign of recognition. She might have slightly widened her eyes, but he couldn't be sure. She was definitely very nervous though.

“Lovely to meet you.” Quinn smiled politely and gestured for them to come in. “My husband is in the living room. Right through here.” She strategically stepped back, so Viki went through the arch first, following with Tenn behind her.

“Joel?” She spoke, and they both watched as he looked over from the baseball game on TV, saw Viki, and the colour drained from his face. “This is Tenn and his wife, Viki.” Joel and Viki just stared at each other, dumbfounded and Quinn made a show of looking surprised and a little concerned. “Do you two know each other?”

“Yeah. We work together.” Joel recovered fairly quickly and stood up. “Viki is the new receptionist at the dealership.”

“Yes,” Viki said faintly, nodding.

“Oh, excellent! This makes things so much better.” Quinn said brightly as she walked over and took Joel's arm. He looked down at her and smiled nervously. “This is Tenn, Tenn, my husband, Joel.” They shook hands and said hello. “I just have a few things to take care of in the kitchen, so come through, and we'll have a glass of wine before we eat.” She gestured for them to follow her and led the way to the kitchen. The atmosphere was tense and awkward, but Tenn had to hand it to her and her acting abilities because she sounded like she was in the middle of a great dinner party. “I made homemade spaghetti and meatballs with a garlic cheese loaf and Caesar salad. I hope that's okay with everyone.”

“Sounds and smells wonderful, Quinn,” Tenn said brightly, emulating her attitude, but being very honest, it did sound wonderful, and the smells of garlic and tomato sauce were making his stomach growl in anticipation. “You didn't have to go through so much trouble.” The kitchen was warm, bright, and cheerful, with creamsicle orange walls and terracotta floor tiles. The cupboards were dark teal, and the counters were dark wood grain with resin. It was clearly set up for large, informal gatherings, with a sizable round table in an oversized glass breakfast nook.

“No trouble at all. I love to cook. I make a monthly dinner for the staff at the library; most of them are students working part-time and living away from home, so getting a home-cooked meal every now and then makes them feel less homesick.” She smiled as she took the lid off the spaghetti sauce and quickly stirred it. “Just have to put the loaf in the oven to melt the cheese and cook the pasta, and we can eat. Joel, would you mind handling the drinks, please?”

“Yeah, no problem.” Tenn noticed his smile was very forced and had to admit that removing his desire to call them both out was making this a lot of fun. “We have a couple of bottles of wine, but I can make a drink at the bar, too. I know Quinn will have wine, Tenn?”

“Wine sounds great.” Tenn nodded. He watched Quinn move around the kitchen, calm and confident in her space and tried to syphon some of it to him. He still kind of wanted to punch Joel in the throat but was also enjoying his discomfort. Realising Viki hadn't said a word. He looked to see her standing frozen in the doorway, looking like someone had kicked her puppy. “Come in and sit down, Vik.” He gestured at the stool next to him. She shook her head and forced a smile as she came in.

“Sorry, I'm just surprised, that's all. Joel had painted you as more of a free-spirited hippie/bohemian woman, not quite so domesticated.” She met Joel's eyes reproachfully as he poured the wine, and Tenn noted that he hadn't asked her what she would want, just poured her a glass of red wine.

“Oh?” Quinn laughed lightly. “I am the head librarian in the Visual Arts Resource Library at Boston University, and I paint and like to dress a little hippish, I guess. I'm probably not as domestic as he would like. That whole stay-at-home wife thing was never something I wanted to do.”

“I was raised to believe the men look after their wives; what can I say?” Joel shrugged as he passed out the wine. “Men work and make money, and their wives look after the home.”

“Tenn believes women should contribute,” Viki said a little snarkily as she took the glass of wine from Joel. Tenn noticed that when their fingers touched, Joel pulled away like he had been shocked.

“Yes. If someone wants to be a stay-at-home wife, they should contribute by keeping the house clean, cooking meals, and making it easier for their husband to work more to fund them both.” Tenn said mildly, not looking to have this fight with her again, especially in front of Quinn. “Especially if there are no children to look after.”

“Exactly.” Joel nodded and sounded surprised that Tenn had that view, making Tenn wonder what Viki had told him.

“And if she wants to work and help contribute financially, then the husband helps contribute to the household chores.” Tenn continued. “Nothing should fall one hundred percent on either spouse. It's supposed to be a partnership.”

“I agree.” Quinn smiled at Tenn as she began pulling out plates.

“Do you need a hand?” Tenn asked. It was clear Joel wasn't going to help; he was sitting at the end of the island snacking on the grapes in the fruit bowl.

“Um. Sure, could you pull the garlic loaf out of the oven, please?” Quinn nodded and gave him a smile of thanks as she put a strainer in the sink and grabbed the pot of pasta to drain.

“No problem.” He got up and came around the island. Her kitchen was very intuitive, and he found the oven mitts immediately. They moved easily around each other like they had been doing this for years. “Did you make this from scratch as well?”

“Yep. And the pasta too.” She smiled and began plating and carrying things over to the glassed-in nook off the kitchen. “I only use the dining room for holidays, so we'll eat here.”

“This isn't the dining room?” Tenn chuckled. The table was set up for four, but the space was large enough that she could expand the table to fit eight comfortably or ten if they didn't mind reduced elbow room.

“It's an enlarged breakfast nook.” Joel came in carrying the wine. “I went away to a conference for a week and came back to this.” He shook his head.

“You got this done in a week?” Tenn looked around in amazement as they sat down. “Who was your contractor?”

Quinn looked a little confused. “You don’t know? My twin brother is Quill Turner.”

“As in Q Architecture?” Tenn paused. Now he knew why she looked so familiar; he and Quill had known each other for years. Quill often used him as a consultant for historical projects, and a picture of him with Quinn at their graduation from Boston University was hung up on his office wall. “Quill and I know each other quite well.” He found out about Quinn at a meeting a few years ago when Quill had called and asked him to change their meeting location to in front of the hospital. He had walked up to find him slumped on a bench under a tree.

“Quill! Is everything okay?” Tenn was concerned; he'd never seen Quill look so upset and exhausted, and they had worked together on some long and difficult projects.

“My twin sister collapsed at work yesterday. I forgot all about our meeting until my phone reminded me. Sorry.” Quill put his face in his hands and took a deep breath.

“Hey, don't apologize. We could have met anytime. Is she okay?” Quill had only mentioned his twin in passing, but he had gathered that they were very close and spent a lot of time together.

“She's currently sedated to reduce stress on her heart and being force-fed by a tube through her nose.” Quill rubbed his face and looked up at the hospital. “All thanks to her prick of a husband and our bitch of a mother.”

“Do you need anything?” Tenn didn't know what else to say. Quill hadn't told him much about his family, just that he was only in contact with his twin.

“An alibi if her husband goes missing?” Quill let out a dry chuckle, and Tenn noticed his knuckles were cut and bruised.

“Absolutely. What did he do?”

“Told her she was letting herself go and getting fat, knowing exactly what would happen,” Quill growled, anger flashing across his face. “She's anorexic. Our older sister, Queenie, is a model, absolutely gorgeous. Tall, willowy, graceful and can eat an entire large pizza herself, go for a run and not gain a pound. Just one of the ones who won the genetic lottery in every way possible. Our mother had her in beauty pageants and spent all her time doting on her. Dad wanted a boy, so she got pregnant, and Q and I were born. When it became clear Q wouldn't get any taller and wouldn't be a slender pageant princess like Queenie; Mom stopped interacting with her except to tell her to lose weight; she was too fat and an embarrassment. Which is hilarious because Q was about fifty pounds lighter at her largest than Mom was at her smallest. Queenie and I take after Dad, tall, with fast metabolisms. Quinn is the only one who took after Mom, and she has to work harder to stay in a healthy weight range. She’s never been overweight; she’s just not built to be tiny if that makes sense.”

“We have that “Twin Connection” and have always been very close, but Dad and I were constantly going to my track meets, games and tournaments. Queenie had Mom, I had Dad, Q had me, and I was always gone.” He shoved his hand through his light brown hair, messing it up further. “She cut back on eating until she practically lived on lettuce and began working out fanatically. Dad and I were at a national track meet in Texas, Mom and Queenie were doing some modelling show in New York City, and Q was with my grandparents in Worcester. The school called and told us she had collapsed and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.” Quill sniffed, and Tenn just sat quietly, letting him get it out.

“She almost fucking died, and my parents and sister's response was to get angry at her for ruining things and making them come back to deal with her “dramatics.” The fact that their fifteen-year-old daughter was in a hospital bed, sixty pounds underweight, with every bone on prominent display and a feeding tube in her nose meant nothing to them. No one knew how skinny she was because she wore layers of baggy clothes.”

“My Grandparents didn't want her to go back to our house because they knew she wouldn't be looked after the way she needed to be, so they called my aunt, my dad's sister, and she came and took Q home with her to New York, where she did inpatient care for a year then transitioned back to my aunt's house. We kept in touch through email and online chats but didn't see each other again until we went to University.” Quill sighed. “Sorry for dumping on you. I think I have some unresolved trauma that seeing her like this all over again has triggered.”",1,1750923554.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

A deep darkness surrounded him, suffocating in its solidity. Headlights created a slight reprieve, illuminating the road before him, yellow beams casting the visible world in an unnatural hue. Cracked and deserted asphalt lay ahead of him, traveled only by those who knew what a long drive really *meant*. 

Cool air rushed past his face, banishing the stuffy desert heat creeping into his cabin. The sun had just gone down, so the temperature was still uncomfortably hot. Yet soon, he’d have to turn the heaters on instead as the night chill set in. 

He sang along to the music that filled the cabin, mouthing the lyrics with ease.

“*No stop signs, speed limit, nobody’s gonna slow me down.*”

 His lukewarm cup of coffee was almost empty now as he took another sip. He shifted in his seat, settling further into the hypnotic frequency of tires hitting the road. He knew he’d fall asleep at the wheel listening to it if he let himself. 

His phone buzzed again, adding to the long list of missed calls and texts. He sighed and turned it off. The fallout was worse than he thought it would be. His breakup had been messy, and he sported a few new bruises as penance. He had run away once again. He never faced the problem, always turned his back and let it happen. Never listening to his friend's warnings. 

His RV was his safe space. It was a sanctuary, a bubble all to himself that could take him away from reality. His destination was not predetermined; he just wanted to be as far away from his home as possible. The highway he was on now was his salvation. 

Taking the last sip of his coffee, he fumbled with the empty cup, sending it down to the passenger seat floor. Grumbling, trying to keep his eyes on the road, he bent over to fish around for the cup. Instead, he almost impaled his eye on the straw sticking out of the other cup in the holder. 

“Fuck” He muttered while jerking away. *That could have been bad.* Foregoing the cup–he planned to get it when he was parked–he steeled himself and focused on his music.

“*Nobody’s gonna mess me around\~”* 

The light warbled and flickered before him as he passed over uneven ground, creating an unnerving atmosphere. His eyes followed the dull images of indiscernible shadows dancing about, his brain determined to make something out of them. 

He was used to this. He had often run away from his problems, getting on the road and driving well into dusk. He had become accustomed to his mind's tendency to create fake fantasies and ideas out of the shadows. Glancing up at the sky, the best part of night drives reveals itself: the sky alight with countless stars, painting a beautiful portrait of the universe. 

He looked back down, glancing at his gas gauge. He grimaced. It was much lower than he had thought when he took off. He had no real idea of where a gas station would be, so he prayed one would show up soon.

He sighed deeply, returning to the monotonous drive.



\*\*\*



His gauge confirmed his fears; his fuel was now dangerously low. But fate was on his side. An oasis appeared, cutting through the darkness. The bright sign of a truck stop illuminated the air around it down the road, practically glowing with promise. His nerves were starting to fray because of the amount of caffeine he had consumed, and the stress of gas problems only added to them.  

He reached into the glove box, pulled out a container of Advil, and popped two into his mouth, swallowing them dry. *I need to fill up on them again.* 

As he got closer, he saw a small building. The roof above the gas pumps was attached to it, and fluorescent lights blanketed the dull concrete and metal of the station. Surprisingly, around the back, he could see a large parking lot with many spaces occupied. 

He wondered why there were so many cars out here at this time of night, at this seemingly random location. Pulling up to the station, he saw that the small store was empty save for an older woman reading a book behind the counter, not looking up as his loud RV pulled up next to one of the gas pumps. 

Shutting off the engine brought a deathly silence. After hours of driving, the lack of engine hum was disconcerting. Every other noise seemed louder like his keys jingling and the locks disengaging. They now sounded like gunshots in this silence. 

His surroundings were unnaturally white. The harsh fluorescent lights hurt his eyes, making his headache worse. The hum of electricity in the air was quiet but constant. He took a deep breath in, happy to finally stretch his legs. The sharp smell of gasoline filled his nose, and it permeated throughout the station. 

A glint in the corner of his eye caught his attention. Lying on the floor next to the pump was a battered driver's license. He bent over and picked it up. The name and address had been crudely scratched out, and a giant wall of a man filled the top right frame. As he was bent over inspecting the license a small shift in his periphery made him look towards his RV. A shadow moved on the other side of his RV, he barely caught the edge of it as he looked under his car. 

It looked like a pair of shoes. His heartbeat sped up slightly; *where did this guy come from?* 

“Hello?” No answer was received; his lone voice echoing through the station. 

He tried again.

Silence.

He carefully moved towards the front of his car, keeping his eye on the shadowy feet peeking underneath. The shadows moved, taking a step towards the rear of the car mirroring his movements. He took a step forward, the shadow took one back. 

“Hey what is your problem man!” He shouted. *What the hell kind of game is this!* He kept his head where he could see under the car as he got closer to the hood, getting ready to bolt around the front and catch the interloper before they could round the back and escape his sight. 

Once he was close enough he bent his legs and dashed around the front. 

“Hey!” 

There was just empty air. He dropped to the ground looking under the car to find where the interloper went. Scanning the lot from his position on the floor he found nothing amiss throughout the station. 

“What the…” he muttered to himself.

Getting up he ran around the back to check the other side again. Only an empty station met him. *God dammit, am I seeing things?* He took a deep breath, grounding himself. A throbbing beat filled his ears. Pressing the palms of his callused hands to his eye sockets he tried to will away the pounding in his head.

He stalked over to the entrance, the clear glass sliding doors squealing in protest as they opened; a garbled chime announced his arrival. Ratty, yellowed, linoleum-lined floors with the corners peeling up near the walls. The small shop looked like any old gas stop, with junk food high in calories, a coffee machine, cigarettes lining the wall behind the counter, chips galore, and some dubious packaged sushi. Fridges lined the wall directly across from him, and sodas, energy drinks, beers, and alcohol were at the far end.

To his left, the wiry old woman he saw through the glass still had her nose in her book, not even glancing up when he walked in. She looked like a ghost, with sallow skin drenched in white light, and the bags under her drooping eyes were deep with fatigue. Her hair was thinning with fading brown streaks that were swallowed by the sea of grey. A well-worn flannel was draped over her shoulders, the seams starting to come apart at the edges. 

Her presence was almost negligible, her form blending in like a part of the station. Taking a breath and pulling out his wallet, he stared at the lack of bills. A thinning twenty and a few loose ones were all that was left. Grabbing the lost license and his last bill, he walked over to the counter. His shoes click, echoing in the silence.  

“I found this outside on the floor next to pump one,” he slid over the license. “Oh, also, can I get pump one? I promise not to drop *my* license while I'm out there,” he chuckled, placing the bill on the decrepit counter and shifting awkwardly at the silence. Lottery tickets that looked like relics collected dust under the glass, their fading colors dull and lifeless. The woman slowly raised her head, putting a finger between the pages and closing the book. Her sharp blue eyes bore into him and were full of life and vigor. 

As her eyes passed over the license, her body froze for a moment, her knuckles gripping the book turning white, and she looked up at him with tired eyes.

“Another new face, huh?” She asked with a slight sniffle. 

“Uh, yeah, never been around here before.” 

The woman scoffed and looked at him sorrowfully before steeling her expression to a neutral one. 

“Then let me tell you the rules.” She took an old used lottery ticket, stuck it into the saved space in her book, and put it off to the side. She folded her arms on the counter and leaned forward. 

“The rules?” He asked incredulously.

“Take it as ya will. I'm just givin’ ya the information to survive.” Her tone was even, the content of her words and inflection clashing. 

“Survive?” 

The old woman leaned back, her chair squeaking and groaning. She breathed deeply, “Just listen, alright, don't interrupt me.” The old woman looked at him, waiting for a response.

“Okay…” he drew out the word in a questioning manner. “Whatever passes the hours, I guess, but I need to head out, busy night and all that.” He said while gesturing vaguely with his hand. The uneasiness he had been feeling was now creeping back, stronger, and he wanted to get out of there quickly. 

“There's gonna be a hitchhiker on the road outta here. You *have* to pick him up. It's not an if. You *will* pick him up. Do not under any circumstances talk to him.” Her voice became stern and powerful, showing a seriousness she had not before. “Don't look at him too much either. He doesn't like that. If he tells ya he's at his destination, stop immediately and let him out. If he talks to ya outside of tellin' ya his drop-off point, don't respond.” Her face was serious, her brow furrowed while her blue eyes drilled into him. 

“Okay.” He looked at the old woman, his eyebrow quirked up. He didn't know what the hell she was talking about, chalking it up to the crazed ramblings of an old woman. “Can I just get this on pump one, please?” He said, tapping the bill on the counter.

The old woman scoffed and took the bill from him. Spinning around in her chair to open the register, she said with an even voice again, “Don't say I didn't warn ya, just tryna help.” 

“Yea. Thanks.” He said with a hint of sarcasm. The old woman grumbled as she busied herself with the register and computer. 

“Alright, pumps ready.” The old woman looked back into his eyes. There was something there—fear? Sadness? Pity? He couldn't tell; this situation worsened his headache, and the pounding in his ears became louder. 

The cool night air hit him in full force when he stepped outside. The day's residual heat was gone, and the wind now had a sharp edge as he walked to the pump. 

Opening the door to the RV, he pulled the gas tank switch and shut the driver's side door. The loud bang of its closing startled him as the sound echoed through the station like a beacon, alerting any horrors that may lay beyond the lights. He unrooted himself from the floor and trudged over to the nozzle. Picking it up, he took a calming breath, the scent of gasoline stronger now, making him wince. 

Shaking his head, he inserted the nozzle into the tank and pressed the cheapest option. The machine whirred, and the flow of liquid could be heard faintly filling the tank.  

Shadows danced around him as he waited, insect silhouettes creating images on the station's floor, making him uneasy. He kept scanning the station as he waited, feeling like someone was watching him. The pump clicked, snapping him from his stupor, signaling that his meager twenty had been used up. Putting the pump back, he beelined it for his cabin, shutting the door quickly behind him.

*What is with this place? That shadow–and that woman! I've had some weird clerks before, but that one took the cake. What was with the odd rules? You're gonna pick up a hitchhiker? Yeah, I'm not doin' that. I don't need your cryptic nonsense, lady. God, this place is weirding me out.* With shaky hands, he fumbled the key into the ignition, putting the car into drive. 

He pushed down harder than he meant to on the gas, jerking him back into his seat. He sped out of there, happy to leave the place behind. Looking in the side mirror, he saw the lot full of cars again. He hadn't even thought about it while in the station. *Where were all of those people? Surely they didn’t leave their cars there and walk away, right?*

As he drove, his mind kept returning to what the old woman had said, like a song stuck in his head.

The warnings repeated. 

*Pick him up. Don't talk to him. Don't look at him. Drop him off when he tells you.*

The car was utterly silent, besides the engine hum. The air was stagnant and dry. His eyes were red and uncomfortable as the road moved underneath him. 

Movement down the road caught his attention, his eyes locking onto the object that stuck out in its surroundings. His whole body clenched. *No way. Right?* He slowed the car down, unable to determine what caught his attention. The car was at a crawl as the headlight's edges crept closer and closer to the shadowy movement. Leaning forward, he squinted, trying to make any details out. The lights crept up the silhouette as he got closer.

And closer.

And closer.

He saw a degraded mannequin standing upright, its arms missing with colorful spray paint and myriad stickers covering it. 

He let out a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding. He laughed hysterically at his gullibility for falling for this little prank. Someone had set up a fake hitchhiker down the road, and judging by how vandalized it was, this had happened before. *God, why did I get so scared over this? What a fucking joke!*

He didn't look back as he passed it. 

Continuing his drive, he tried to forget about the little prank. Still, his mind kept returning to it. His mind was determined to make something out of every little movement and shadow he saw. He tried to tell himself that it was just a joke, it wasnt real. He saw the proof: the mannequin purposefully placed down from the gas reason enough. It was made to do one thing.

To scare him. 

He wouldn't let it.

Another flash of movement caught his attention. He didn't look at it, willing his mind to stop making up possibilities of what it could be. As the lights passed over it, his whole body froze.

A man with his arm extended, thumb up, and smile on his face.

He was emaciated, his white skin seemingly transparent in the glow of the headlights. He had a worn denim jacket with a white shirt underneath. The shirt was thin and stained, while the coat had multiple embroidered patches running down the side of the sleeve. A pair of black slacks and black shoes finished off his nondescript outfit. 

His face looked like everyone and no one simultaneously, and he couldn't pin down his features as if they had moved and shifted with the light. His eyes were black as he stared at the RV, tracking its approach. He wore an ear-to-ear grin, making them crinkle at the edges. His yellowing teeth on full display. Greasy brown hair stuck to his forehead and around his ears. 

His skin prickled at the sight of him, his breath hitching. The man kept smiling and holding up his thumb as he got closer. Ignoring him, he looked back to the road ahead, pressing harder on the gas pedal. He couldn't help but glance as the hitchhiker passed his window, his smile still agonizingly wide. It looked like an imitation, with no real emotion or kindness behind it, just an empty shell. He watched as the hitchhiker grew smaller and smaller in the rearview mirror, finally letting out a deep breath and easing up on the gas when the darkness swallowed him up. The man had made no moves besides the slow turning of his head as he watched the RV pass.

He let out a hysterical chuckle as his heart pounded in his chest, pushing the fear and uneasiness behind him. *Wow, what a fucking coincidence, that scared the shit outta me! God, if that woman saw how bad that got me, she probably be laughing her ass off.* He clenched his hands, and anger started to build up. He didn't need this extra stress. Steadying his mind, he continued driving, the road wobbling and the engine firing. 

A figure lit up down the road. His blood ran cold when he realized it was a hitchhiker with his arm out, thumb up, and a smile on his face—the same person he had just passed. *How in the hell did he get back in front of me?* 

A feeling of dread washed over him as he crept closer to the hitchhiker. He pressed the gas pedal down as he got closer, avoiding looking at the man. *It could be a coincidence; some guy that looked like the other one, and it was not like his clothes were anything special. On the contrary, they were pretty ordinary.* Except it wasn't. The patches were there, and his face had the same qualities that made him squirm. 

He dared not look as he saw the blur of the man pass in his periphery. He focused on getting the horrible dread out of his mind. His chest tightened as the world went dim around him, his hearing dulling and his eyes shaking. His hands gripped the wheel for support as he forcefully shut his eyes. Taking deep breaths, he steadied himself. Opening his eyes, he saw an alarming scene playing in front of him. A man with an arm pointed towards him, thumbs up, smiling, was in the middle of the road, the lights bleaching out any color from his skin as he barreled towards him. 

Slamming on the brakes, his body snapped forward, and he hit his head on the steering wheel, stars flashing in his vision. The screeching of tires filled his ears as he tried to turn the car to avoid ramming into the man. 

He was sure he had hit the man with how long his RV took to stop. He settled into place, his body falling back into the seat as the car halted completely. His head was down, and his eyes were closed as he collected himself. With bated breath, he opened his eyes, vision swimming slightly, and looked at what gruesome scene would surely lie before him. 

It was him. The man with his arm extended, thumb up, smile on his face.

He was unharmed and stood stalk still. As soon as he laid eyes upon the man, he walked around the side of his RV, going to the back passenger side door. Fumbling to engage the locks, his vision swam as he wiped his head around to the door panel, making it impossible to steady himself to press the small button. 

The car door clicked open.

His entire body completely stilled as the shuffling of clothes and quiet breaths filled the eerie silence. The man shut the door softly, and a click signaled his seatbelt was on. Looking up from where his hand was hovering above the lock button, he stared into the rearview mirror. The hitchhiker's smiling face stared back. 

His hand white-knuckled the steering wheel as he stared into the man's deep black eyes, a soulless orb that let no light in, a true darkness. He slowly turned his head around to look directly at the man. His whole body shook as he looked at the hitchhiker, a smile deceptively wide. His entire persona was just *off.*  His posture made his head sag too low. His body pressed uncomfortably into the seat, with his arms hanging limply by his sides. His neck was too long, and his shoulders were too broad, making his jacket stretch against them. 

His fear turned into panic. He wanted him out of his car. *Now.*

“Get the fuck out of my car!” his voice betrayed him. It shook, revealing his fear. 

The hitchhiker stared back and said with an air of calmness. “This isn't my stop.”

“W-wha? Who the fuck are you?!” His breathing hitched as the man's face dropped, his smile gone, and a visage of calm anger took its place, a deep, unnerving projection of his impatience. He whipped his head back around to the road, making his head spin slightly. That face made him pale, and a deep shaking rocked his body. The air was eerily still, and no noises were coming from either man, like time had stopped, waiting for them to do something.  

The old woman’s warning rang in his head: *You will pick him up.*

*Don't talk to him. Don't look at him. Drop him off when he tells you.*

She was right. 

Some power made this man get into his car. Something unnatural, his subconscious screamed to get as far away as he could. 

*He had fucked up.*

He had to drive him. The rules the old woman told him were real. The man was proof of that. He steeled himself as he put the RV into drive and continued down the road. He didn't want to open himself to the man. He didn't want the man to hear him for fear of revealing something he was scared of. He dared not speak to the man anymore.

As the car's engine awoke, its hum was muffled and distorted. Like a corrupted recording, it stuttered and shook. As the car came up to speed, he looked back into the rearview mirror. The man's fake smile was back, plastered on, wider than any normal smile should be. 

It made him want to crumple in on himself. His breath was quick and shallow, head pounding louder with every passing second. The car churned through the darkness. He pushed the engine to the limit as he floored the gas pedal. 

It wasnt fast enough to escape the dread that filled the cabin. 

The thing made no moves, and with every glance at the mirror, its eyes bored into him. 

He couldn't stop meeting the man's eyes in the rearview. He tried to fight it, but like a trainwreck, he had to watch it. It pulled him in.

He looked at it once again, and this time its face was gone. A nothingness was in its place, a deep pit of darkness that no light could penetrate. His whole body paled as he stared into the void. It was pulling him in like a black hole. Tears forced themselves from his eyes. They ran down his face, and a feeling of total helplessness washed over him. He couldn't look away, and with every moment that passed, he could feel his mind warping, his very being shook.

His eyes would not close. He could not blink. He could not turn away. He *had* to look at it.

He took a shaking hand, feeling around, and found the straw of the empty drink in the cupholder. He picked it up, knowing what he had to do. 

He *had* to look away. 

With his fading willpower, he plunged the straw into his eye. The pain brought him back. Blood and viscera descended his face as his eye tore apart in its socket. His guttural scream filled the silence. He kept screaming as the pain bored into his head. His vocal cords became raw and broken. His rasping breaths were all that was left. 

But he had looked away.

The straw was impaled in him, blood coming out of the end like it was being sucked through. It poured down onto the floor as he hung his head. His remaining vision swam as his stomach heaved. He needed to look back to the road. He needed to keep driving. 

*Pick him up. Don't talk to him. Don't look at him. Drop him off when he tells you.*

His rasping breaths came shorter and quicker as the pain started to get worse, his mind catching up, the initial shock wearing off. He didn't know how he had stayed on the road, but he was still perfectly in his lane, never deviating. 

Time seemed irrelevant as his head swam. The road ahead was straightforward, as it had been for–who knows how long. His breathing was deep and ragged now, tiredness washing over him as his eye throbbed in deep pain. 

A small light down the road caught his attention, a small structure illuminated by a streetlight above it. As he got closer, he saw it was a small bus stop. 

In the middle of nowhere. 

As he drew closer, a voice broke the silence.

“This is my stop.”

\*\*\*

The telltale sound of an engine told her a car had rolled into the station. She read her book, the same one she reads every day. She waits for the door's shrill chime, but it doesn't sound as time passes. 

Looking up from her book, she sees the same RV that left a few hours ago. Taking a deep breath, she readies and walks out into the brisk night. Striding up to the RV, she pulls the door handle, and it opens without pause. The inside is empty, and the engine is still running.

A small pool of blood stained the carpet, droplets splattering the seat. She looks at the scene with indifference and hops into the driver's seat. The keys were still in the ignition; the cabin was warm, and the residual body heat could still be felt on the seat as she settled in.

Forgoing the seatbelt, she put the car in drive and rounded the corner of the gas station, moving it to the parking lot full of cars. Pulling into the closest space, she parked, took the keys out, and locked its doors for the last time. Walking back, her heavy steps echoed throughout the station.

She sighed as he opened the backdoor, tossing the keys into the bucket with the rest of them. The small clink of the keys was muffled by the others filling the bucket. She closed the door, not bothering to lock it. Walking back to the front, she sank back into her tattered chair and picked up her book. Waiting for the doors to chime once again.

1lku0rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/1lku0rj/full_colon_pain_off_the_scale/,"Full colon, pain off the scale.","Hi - Just a post to add some information to help out anyone else who might have experienced the same thing.

So I have a L4L5S1 disc issue with disc material escaping and severely pressing on the sciatic nerve. This has been a month of chronic pain and difficulty walking and sleeping. Actually unrelenting at night with the worst of nerve pain. All meds useless against this kind of pain. Tramadol knocked me out for 2-4 hours then the pain woke me up again. I'm improving in the day and still have numbness from the knee up.

I read up on constipation and opiods/fake opiods and of course, there is a connection. For me an immediate one. I forced myself off the Tramadol and decided to tough it out (2 hours sleep etc) The constipation went, then I 'went' and things were better but it took a good hour after a toilet visit for the pain to subside a little. I'd noticed the connection before with chronic lower back pain and a full bowel. It always improved the pain immediately after 'going'

The decending colon and Sigmoid colon (the final part before the anus) are close proximity to the sciatic nerve and run along the left of the body (if looking down) The side I have the sciatic nerve problem, so the problem is compounded.

So I've put myself on one meal a day, eaten late and not too large. The sleep improved to 4 or 5 hours, then 1 or 2 hours, until last night. I was really hungry and ate a huge single meal at around 5.30PM, this started to put in an appearance in my colon (causing horrific sciatic pain) at 3AM in bed. I went to the toilet at around 6AM, then a couple of times more (loads of vegetables last evening) - The pain took 90 minutes to back off and I was relatively pain free after 2 hours.

I'm going back on a small one meal a day again today, eaten late. I have lost 4 kilos already from an original 68KG (stopped alcohol as well for hydration) weight but to sleep better is the objective. I have a neuro surgery appointment in 10 days and will share all of this with the surgeon as they figure out a strategy for my lower back that has multiple other issues but is normally symptom free.

I drink black coffee and water with electrolytes and vitamin C during the day. I'm an regular 'faster' so it hasn't been much of a big deal.

To close, my worst nights were as the Tramadol wore off, 2/3 days worth of digested food hanging around and impacting the sciatic nerve because of the opiate side effects of constipation. I could barely walk. It wasn't a pay-off worthwhile, for me anyway - 4 hours of sleep and a headache after to boot.

OK, hope this helps someone move a little forward. 

Wishing you all recovery, good times and support.",1,1750923301.0,Sciatica,0,1.0,False

All of Manhattan knew about the PECULIAR TRADITION in the Forrester family, New York's wealthiest dynasty—Every new bride had to spend her wedding night alone in the family chapel, praying until dawn. Only those who emerged unharmed the next morning were considered blessed by the Forrester ancestors.

What once had been just a formality turned into a nightmare when Callum Forrester, the current heir, took a bride.

His bride was found dead in the chapel, her throat slashed with a gruesome wound, her limbs grotesquely twisted.

Every security camera was reviewed, but the footage clearly showed no one had entered the chapel that night except the bride herself.

Later, Callum married seven more times over the years, and horrifyingly, each bride met the same fate on her wedding night in that chapel.

Police investigations yielded nothing conclusive, and each death was eventually ruled a suicide.

Rumors spread throughout Manhattan—some claimed the Forrester estate was haunted, others whispered about dark rituals. No family would risk sending their daughter there anymore.

But today, I stood before Mrs. Forrester in a crimson dress, my posture graceful yet determined.

""Mr. Forrester is exceptionally handsome,"" I said. ""I've admired him from afar for years. I'm willing to be his ninth wife.""

I looked her directly in the eyes. ""Don't worry. Your ancestors may not have liked the others, but they'll certainly like me.""

\---

My family ran a small bakery on York Avenue.

Before dawn each morning, my sister would help our parents with the work—kneading dough, preparing fillings, making pastries, brewing coffee. She excelled at everything and never let me help.

""Melody, you're meant for academics,"" she would say. ""Just focus on your studies.""

""We'll support you all the way to success!""

Eight years ago, on the day I was announced as Manhattan's valedictorian.

My sister, dressed in a pristine white gown, shyly boarded the luxurious wedding car sent by the Forrester family.

Everyone envied her good fortune. While serving coffee one morning, she had somehow caught the eye of Callum Forrester, heir to the family fortune, and was now marrying into wealth and privilege.

I was happy for her too, not because of the Forrester fortune, but because of the shy, joyful look on her face before she left:

""Melody, don't worry about me. Callum is truly kind, and his family has been welcoming,"" she said, holding my hands. ""I need to fly higher so you can go further. You'll always be the sister I'll protect with everything I have!""

That night, I dreamed my sister had a beautiful baby who called me ""Auntie"" in the sweetest voice while clutching my shirt.

But the next morning, the shocking news of my sister's death shattered our world.

I raced to the Forrester estate, arriving just as they carried her out on a crude stretcher.

My sister's once delicate hands were now bruised and gray. Her fingertips were bloody, all ten nails forcibly torn off, the flesh raw and mangled.

Despite everyone's attempts to stop me, I yanked back the sheet covering her.",1,1750923245.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

A deep darkness surrounded him, suffocating in its solidity. Headlights created a slight reprieve, illuminating the road before him, yellow beams casting the visible world in an unnatural hue. Cracked and deserted asphalt lay ahead of him, traveled only by those who knew what a long drive really *meant*. 

Cool air rushed past his face, banishing the stuffy desert heat creeping into his cabin. The sun had just gone down, so the temperature was still uncomfortably hot. Yet soon, he’d have to turn the heaters on instead as the night chill set in. 

He sang along to the music that filled the cabin, mouthing the lyrics with ease.

“*No stop signs, speed limit, nobody’s gonna slow me down.*”

 His lukewarm cup of coffee was almost empty now as he took another sip. He shifted in his seat, settling further into the hypnotic frequency of tires hitting the road. He knew he’d fall asleep at the wheel listening to it if he let himself. 

His phone buzzed again, adding to the long list of missed calls and texts. He sighed and turned it off. The fallout was worse than he thought it would be. His breakup had been messy, and he sported a few new bruises as penance. He had run away once again. He never faced the problem, always turned his back and let it happen. Never listening to his friend's warnings. 

His RV was his safe space. It was a sanctuary, a bubble all to himself that could take him away from reality. His destination was not predetermined; he just wanted to be as far away from his home as possible. The highway he was on now was his salvation. 

Taking the last sip of his coffee, he fumbled with the empty cup, sending it down to the passenger seat floor. Grumbling, trying to keep his eyes on the road, he bent over to fish around for the cup. Instead, he almost impaled his eye on the straw sticking out of the other cup in the holder. 

“Fuck” He muttered while jerking away. *That could have been bad.* Foregoing the cup–he planned to get it when he was parked–he steeled himself and focused on his music.

“*Nobody’s gonna mess me around\~”* 

The light warbled and flickered before him as he passed over uneven ground, creating an unnerving atmosphere. His eyes followed the dull images of indiscernible shadows dancing about, his brain determined to make something out of them. 

He was used to this. He had often run away from his problems, getting on the road and driving well into dusk. He had become accustomed to his mind's tendency to create fake fantasies and ideas out of the shadows. Glancing up at the sky, the best part of night drives reveals itself: the sky alight with countless stars, painting a beautiful portrait of the universe. 

He looked back down, glancing at his gas gauge. He grimaced. It was much lower than he had thought when he took off. He had no real idea of where a gas station would be, so he prayed one would show up soon.

He sighed deeply, returning to the monotonous drive.



\*\*\*



His gauge confirmed his fears; his fuel was now dangerously low. But fate was on his side. An oasis appeared, cutting through the darkness. The bright sign of a truck stop illuminated the air around it down the road, practically glowing with promise. His nerves were starting to fray because of the amount of caffeine he had consumed, and the stress of gas problems only added to them.  

He reached into the glove box, pulled out a container of Advil, and popped two into his mouth, swallowing them dry. *I need to fill up on them again.* 

As he got closer, he saw a small building. The roof above the gas pumps was attached to it, and fluorescent lights blanketed the dull concrete and metal of the station. Surprisingly, around the back, he could see a large parking lot with many spaces occupied. 

He wondered why there were so many cars out here at this time of night, at this seemingly random location. Pulling up to the station, he saw that the small store was empty save for an older woman reading a book behind the counter, not looking up as his loud RV pulled up next to one of the gas pumps. 

Shutting off the engine brought a deathly silence. After hours of driving, the lack of engine hum was disconcerting. Every other noise seemed louder like his keys jingling and the locks disengaging. They now sounded like gunshots in this silence. 

His surroundings were unnaturally white. The harsh fluorescent lights hurt his eyes, making his headache worse. The hum of electricity in the air was quiet but constant. He took a deep breath in, happy to finally stretch his legs. The sharp smell of gasoline filled his nose, and it permeated throughout the station. 

A glint in the corner of his eye caught his attention. Lying on the floor next to the pump was a battered driver's license. He bent over and picked it up. The name and address had been crudely scratched out, and a giant wall of a man filled the top right frame. As he was bent over inspecting the license a small shift in his periphery made him look towards his RV. A shadow moved on the other side of his RV, he barely caught the edge of it as he looked under his car. 

It looked like a pair of shoes. His heartbeat sped up slightly; *where did this guy come from?* 

“Hello?” No answer was received; his lone voice echoing through the station. 

He tried again.

Silence.

He carefully moved towards the front of his car, keeping his eye on the shadowy feet peeking underneath. The shadows moved, taking a step towards the rear of the car mirroring his movements. He took a step forward, the shadow took one back. 

“Hey what is your problem man!” He shouted. *What the hell kind of game is this!* He kept his head where he could see under the car as he got closer to the hood, getting ready to bolt around the front and catch the interloper before they could round the back and escape his sight. 

Once he was close enough he bent his legs and dashed around the front. 

“Hey!” 

There was just empty air. He dropped to the ground looking under the car to find where the interloper went. Scanning the lot from his position on the floor he found nothing amiss throughout the station. 

“What the…” he muttered to himself.

Getting up he ran around the back to check the other side again. Only an empty station met him. *God dammit, am I seeing things?* He took a deep breath, grounding himself. A throbbing beat filled his ears. Pressing the palms of his callused hands to his eye sockets he tried to will away the pounding in his head.

He stalked over to the entrance, the clear glass sliding doors squealing in protest as they opened; a garbled chime announced his arrival. Ratty, yellowed, linoleum-lined floors with the corners peeling up near the walls. The small shop looked like any old gas stop, with junk food high in calories, a coffee machine, cigarettes lining the wall behind the counter, chips galore, and some dubious packaged sushi. Fridges lined the wall directly across from him, and sodas, energy drinks, beers, and alcohol were at the far end.

To his left, the wiry old woman he saw through the glass still had her nose in her book, not even glancing up when he walked in. She looked like a ghost, with sallow skin drenched in white light, and the bags under her drooping eyes were deep with fatigue. Her hair was thinning with fading brown streaks that were swallowed by the sea of grey. A well-worn flannel was draped over her shoulders, the seams starting to come apart at the edges. 

Her presence was almost negligible, her form blending in like a part of the station. Taking a breath and pulling out his wallet, he stared at the lack of bills. A thinning twenty and a few loose ones were all that was left. Grabbing the lost license and his last bill, he walked over to the counter. His shoes click, echoing in the silence.  

“I found this outside on the floor next to pump one,” he slid over the license. “Oh, also, can I get pump one? I promise not to drop *my* license while I'm out there,” he chuckled, placing the bill on the decrepit counter and shifting awkwardly at the silence. Lottery tickets that looked like relics collected dust under the glass, their fading colors dull and lifeless. The woman slowly raised her head, putting a finger between the pages and closing the book. Her sharp blue eyes bore into him and were full of life and vigor. 

As her eyes passed over the license, her body froze for a moment, her knuckles gripping the book turning white, and she looked up at him with tired eyes.

“Another new face, huh?” She asked with a slight sniffle. 

“Uh, yeah, never been around here before.” 

The woman scoffed and looked at him sorrowfully before steeling her expression to a neutral one. 

“Then let me tell you the rules.” She took an old used lottery ticket, stuck it into the saved space in her book, and put it off to the side. She folded her arms on the counter and leaned forward. 

“The rules?” He asked incredulously.

“Take it as ya will. I'm just givin’ ya the information to survive.” Her tone was even, the content of her words and inflection clashing. 

“Survive?” 

The old woman leaned back, her chair squeaking and groaning. She breathed deeply, “Just listen, alright, don't interrupt me.” The old woman looked at him, waiting for a response.

“Okay…” he drew out the word in a questioning manner. “Whatever passes the hours, I guess, but I need to head out, busy night and all that.” He said while gesturing vaguely with his hand. The uneasiness he had been feeling was now creeping back, stronger, and he wanted to get out of there quickly. 

“There's gonna be a hitchhiker on the road outta here. You *have* to pick him up. It's not an if. You *will* pick him up. Do not under any circumstances talk to him.” Her voice became stern and powerful, showing a seriousness she had not before. “Don't look at him too much either. He doesn't like that. If he tells ya he's at his destination, stop immediately and let him out. If he talks to ya outside of tellin' ya his drop-off point, don't respond.” Her face was serious, her brow furrowed while her blue eyes drilled into him. 

“Okay.” He looked at the old woman, his eyebrow quirked up. He didn't know what the hell she was talking about, chalking it up to the crazed ramblings of an old woman. “Can I just get this on pump one, please?” He said, tapping the bill on the counter.

The old woman scoffed and took the bill from him. Spinning around in her chair to open the register, she said with an even voice again, “Don't say I didn't warn ya, just tryna help.” 

“Yea. Thanks.” He said with a hint of sarcasm. The old woman grumbled as she busied herself with the register and computer. 

“Alright, pumps ready.” The old woman looked back into his eyes. There was something there—fear? Sadness? Pity? He couldn't tell; this situation worsened his headache, and the pounding in his ears became louder. 

The cool night air hit him in full force when he stepped outside. The day's residual heat was gone, and the wind now had a sharp edge as he walked to the pump. 

Opening the door to the RV, he pulled the gas tank switch and shut the driver's side door. The loud bang of its closing startled him as the sound echoed through the station like a beacon, alerting any horrors that may lay beyond the lights. He unrooted himself from the floor and trudged over to the nozzle. Picking it up, he took a calming breath, the scent of gasoline stronger now, making him wince. 

Shaking his head, he inserted the nozzle into the tank and pressed the cheapest option. The machine whirred, and the flow of liquid could be heard faintly filling the tank.  

Shadows danced around him as he waited, insect silhouettes creating images on the station's floor, making him uneasy. He kept scanning the station as he waited, feeling like someone was watching him. The pump clicked, snapping him from his stupor, signaling that his meager twenty had been used up. Putting the pump back, he beelined it for his cabin, shutting the door quickly behind him.

*What is with this place? That shadow–and that woman! I've had some weird clerks before, but that one took the cake. What was with the odd rules? You're gonna pick up a hitchhiker? Yeah, I'm not doin' that. I don't need your cryptic nonsense, lady. God, this place is weirding me out.* With shaky hands, he fumbled the key into the ignition, putting the car into drive. 

He pushed down harder than he meant to on the gas, jerking him back into his seat. He sped out of there, happy to leave the place behind. Looking in the side mirror, he saw the lot full of cars again. He hadn't even thought about it while in the station. *Where were all of those people? Surely they didn’t leave their cars there and walk away, right?*

As he drove, his mind kept returning to what the old woman had said, like a song stuck in his head.

The warnings repeated. 

*Pick him up. Don't talk to him. Don't look at him. Drop him off when he tells you.*

The car was utterly silent, besides the engine hum. The air was stagnant and dry. His eyes were red and uncomfortable as the road moved underneath him. 

Movement down the road caught his attention, his eyes locking onto the object that stuck out in its surroundings. His whole body clenched. *No way. Right?* He slowed the car down, unable to determine what caught his attention. The car was at a crawl as the headlight's edges crept closer and closer to the shadowy movement. Leaning forward, he squinted, trying to make any details out. The lights crept up the silhouette as he got closer.

And closer.

And closer.

He saw a degraded mannequin standing upright, its arms missing with colorful spray paint and myriad stickers covering it. 

He let out a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding. He laughed hysterically at his gullibility for falling for this little prank. Someone had set up a fake hitchhiker down the road, and judging by how vandalized it was, this had happened before. *God, why did I get so scared over this? What a fucking joke!*

He didn't look back as he passed it. 

Continuing his drive, he tried to forget about the little prank. Still, his mind kept returning to it. His mind was determined to make something out of every little movement and shadow he saw. He tried to tell himself that it was just a joke, it wasnt real. He saw the proof: the mannequin purposefully placed down from the gas reason enough. It was made to do one thing.

To scare him. 

He wouldn't let it.

Another flash of movement caught his attention. He didn't look at it, willing his mind to stop making up possibilities of what it could be. As the lights passed over it, his whole body froze.

A man with his arm extended, thumb up, and smile on his face.

He was emaciated, his white skin seemingly transparent in the glow of the headlights. He had a worn denim jacket with a white shirt underneath. The shirt was thin and stained, while the coat had multiple embroidered patches running down the side of the sleeve. A pair of black slacks and black shoes finished off his nondescript outfit. 

His face looked like everyone and no one simultaneously, and he couldn't pin down his features as if they had moved and shifted with the light. His eyes were black as he stared at the RV, tracking its approach. He wore an ear-to-ear grin, making them crinkle at the edges. His yellowing teeth on full display. Greasy brown hair stuck to his forehead and around his ears. 

His skin prickled at the sight of him, his breath hitching. The man kept smiling and holding up his thumb as he got closer. Ignoring him, he looked back to the road ahead, pressing harder on the gas pedal. He couldn't help but glance as the hitchhiker passed his window, his smile still agonizingly wide. It looked like an imitation, with no real emotion or kindness behind it, just an empty shell. He watched as the hitchhiker grew smaller and smaller in the rearview mirror, finally letting out a deep breath and easing up on the gas when the darkness swallowed him up. The man had made no moves besides the slow turning of his head as he watched the RV pass.

He let out a hysterical chuckle as his heart pounded in his chest, pushing the fear and uneasiness behind him. *Wow, what a fucking coincidence, that scared the shit outta me! God, if that woman saw how bad that got me, she probably be laughing her ass off.* He clenched his hands, and anger started to build up. He didn't need this extra stress. Steadying his mind, he continued driving, the road wobbling and the engine firing. 

A figure lit up down the road. His blood ran cold when he realized it was a hitchhiker with his arm out, thumb up, and a smile on his face—the same person he had just passed. *How in the hell did he get back in front of me?* 

A feeling of dread washed over him as he crept closer to the hitchhiker. He pressed the gas pedal down as he got closer, avoiding looking at the man. *It could be a coincidence; some guy that looked like the other one, and it was not like his clothes were anything special. On the contrary, they were pretty ordinary.* Except it wasn't. The patches were there, and his face had the same qualities that made him squirm. 

He dared not look as he saw the blur of the man pass in his periphery. He focused on getting the horrible dread out of his mind. His chest tightened as the world went dim around him, his hearing dulling and his eyes shaking. His hands gripped the wheel for support as he forcefully shut his eyes. Taking deep breaths, he steadied himself. Opening his eyes, he saw an alarming scene playing in front of him. A man with an arm pointed towards him, thumbs up, smiling, was in the middle of the road, the lights bleaching out any color from his skin as he barreled towards him. 

Slamming on the brakes, his body snapped forward, and he hit his head on the steering wheel, stars flashing in his vision. The screeching of tires filled his ears as he tried to turn the car to avoid ramming into the man. 

He was sure he had hit the man with how long his RV took to stop. He settled into place, his body falling back into the seat as the car halted completely. His head was down, and his eyes were closed as he collected himself. With bated breath, he opened his eyes, vision swimming slightly, and looked at what gruesome scene would surely lie before him. 

It was him. The man with his arm extended, thumb up, smile on his face.

He was unharmed and stood stalk still. As soon as he laid eyes upon the man, he walked around the side of his RV, going to the back passenger side door. Fumbling to engage the locks, his vision swam as he wiped his head around to the door panel, making it impossible to steady himself to press the small button. 

The car door clicked open.

His entire body completely stilled as the shuffling of clothes and quiet breaths filled the eerie silence. The man shut the door softly, and a click signaled his seatbelt was on. Looking up from where his hand was hovering above the lock button, he stared into the rearview mirror. The hitchhiker's smiling face stared back. 

His hand white-knuckled the steering wheel as he stared into the man's deep black eyes, a soulless orb that let no light in, a true darkness. He slowly turned his head around to look directly at the man. His whole body shook as he looked at the hitchhiker, a smile deceptively wide. His entire persona was just *off.*  His posture made his head sag too low. His body pressed uncomfortably into the seat, with his arms hanging limply by his sides. His neck was too long, and his shoulders were too broad, making his jacket stretch against them. 

His fear turned into panic. He wanted him out of his car. *Now.*

“Get the fuck out of my car!” his voice betrayed him. It shook, revealing his fear. 

The hitchhiker stared back and said with an air of calmness. “This isn't my stop.”

“W-wha? Who the fuck are you?!” His breathing hitched as the man's face dropped, his smile gone, and a visage of calm anger took its place, a deep, unnerving projection of his impatience. He whipped his head back around to the road, making his head spin slightly. That face made him pale, and a deep shaking rocked his body. The air was eerily still, and no noises were coming from either man, like time had stopped, waiting for them to do something.  

The old woman’s warning rang in his head: *You will pick him up.*

*Don't talk to him. Don't look at him. Drop him off when he tells you.*

She was right. 

Some power made this man get into his car. Something unnatural, his subconscious screamed to get as far away as he could. 

*He had fucked up.*

He had to drive him. The rules the old woman told him were real. The man was proof of that. He steeled himself as he put the RV into drive and continued down the road. He didn't want to open himself to the man. He didn't want the man to hear him for fear of revealing something he was scared of. He dared not speak to the man anymore.

As the car's engine awoke, its hum was muffled and distorted. Like a corrupted recording, it stuttered and shook. As the car came up to speed, he looked back into the rearview mirror. The man's fake smile was back, plastered on, wider than any normal smile should be. 

It made him want to crumple in on himself. His breath was quick and shallow, head pounding louder with every passing second. The car churned through the darkness. He pushed the engine to the limit as he floored the gas pedal. 

It wasnt fast enough to escape the dread that filled the cabin. 

The thing made no moves, and with every glance at the mirror, its eyes bored into him. 

He couldn't stop meeting the man's eyes in the rearview. He tried to fight it, but like a trainwreck, he had to watch it. It pulled him in.

He looked at it once again, and this time its face was gone. A nothingness was in its place, a deep pit of darkness that no light could penetrate. His whole body paled as he stared into the void. It was pulling him in like a black hole. Tears forced themselves from his eyes. They ran down his face, and a feeling of total helplessness washed over him. He couldn't look away, and with every moment that passed, he could feel his mind warping, his very being shook.

His eyes would not close. He could not blink. He could not turn away. He *had* to look at it.

He took a shaking hand, feeling around, and found the straw of the empty drink in the cupholder. He picked it up, knowing what he had to do. 

He *had* to look away. 

With his fading willpower, he plunged the straw into his eye. The pain brought him back. Blood and viscera descended his face as his eye tore apart in its socket. His guttural scream filled the silence. He kept screaming as the pain bored into his head. His vocal cords became raw and broken. His rasping breaths were all that was left. 

But he had looked away.

The straw was impaled in him, blood coming out of the end like it was being sucked through. It poured down onto the floor as he hung his head. His remaining vision swam as his stomach heaved. He needed to look back to the road. He needed to keep driving. 

*Pick him up. Don't talk to him. Don't look at him. Drop him off when he tells you.*

His rasping breaths came shorter and quicker as the pain started to get worse, his mind catching up, the initial shock wearing off. He didn't know how he had stayed on the road, but he was still perfectly in his lane, never deviating. 

Time seemed irrelevant as his head swam. The road ahead was straightforward, as it had been for–who knows how long. His breathing was deep and ragged now, tiredness washing over him as his eye throbbed in deep pain. 

A small light down the road caught his attention, a small structure illuminated by a streetlight above it. As he got closer, he saw it was a small bus stop. 

In the middle of nowhere. 

As he drew closer, a voice broke the silence.

“This is my stop.”

\*\*\*

The telltale sound of an engine told her a car had rolled into the station. She read her book, the same one she reads every day. She waits for the door's shrill chime, but it doesn't sound as time passes. 

Looking up from her book, she sees the same RV that left a few hours ago. Taking a deep breath, she readies and walks out into the brisk night. Striding up to the RV, she pulls the door handle, and it opens without pause. The inside is empty, and the engine is still running.

A small pool of blood stained the carpet, droplets splattering the seat. She looks at the scene with indifference and hops into the driver's seat. The keys were still in the ignition; the cabin was warm, and the residual body heat could still be felt on the seat as she settled in.

Forgoing the seatbelt, she put the car in drive and rounded the corner of the gas station, moving it to the parking lot full of cars. Pulling into the closest space, she parked, took the keys out, and locked its doors for the last time. Walking back, her heavy steps echoed throughout the station.

She sighed as he opened the backdoor, tossing the keys into the bucket with the rest of them. The small clink of the keys was muffled by the others filling the bucket. She closed the door, not bothering to lock it. Walking back to the front, she sank back into her tattered chair and picked up her book. Waiting for the doors to chime once again.

When Cassidy Morgan opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn at 27 years old.  
  
At this point in her life, she had two children and was married to Gabriel Westbrook, the billionaire CEO who consistently topped the Forbes list and had been named ""The #1 Most Desirable Bachelor"" by TIME Magazine—a man so sought after that even the British royal family had once hoped to marry their princess to him.  
  
Everyone told her how fortunate she was. Yet the first thing she did after this rebirth was bring divorce papers to his childhood sweetheart.  
  
""I want a divorce,"" Cassidy said calmly, sliding the document across the table to Natalie Hayes. ""Gabriel is yours. The children too. All yours.""  
  
Natalie stared at her in shock, unable to believe that the woman who had occupied the position of Mrs. Westbrook for six years would suddenly volunteer to step aside.  
  
""Since they all prefer you anyway,"" Cassidy added with quiet resignation, ""I'll make it easy for everyone. Just get Gabriel to sign these papers. Once the cooling-off period ends, I'll be gone.""  
  
This time, she refused to repeat her mistakes. She wouldn't continue being the invisible Mrs. Westbrook that everyone overlooked.  
  
Natalie's fingers unconsciously traced the rim of her coffee cup as she frowned. ""What game are you playing, Cassidy?""  
  
""No game,"" Cassidy replied evenly as she observed the shifting expressions on Natalie's face. ""I'm simply done.""  
  
""Do you have any idea how many women would kill to be in your position?"" Natalie challenged.  
  
""I do,"" Cassidy met her gaze directly. ""That's why I'm giving it to you.""  
  
A crack finally appeared in Natalie's perfect façade.  
  
She studied the divorce papers for a long moment before taking them. ""Well, if you're being so generous, I won't refuse.""  
  
""Just remember,"" Natalie added, ""once I have something, I never give it back.""  
  
""Don't worry,"" Cassidy smiled faintly. ""I absolutely won't regret this.""  
  
After all, in her previous life, she had already tasted the bitterness of a lonely existence.  
  
Natalie moved to another table and elegantly picked up her phone, her fingers dancing across the screen.  
  
When the call connected, her voice instantly softened: ""Gabriel, I'm at Blue Mountain Café. Could you come pick me up?""  
  
Cassidy sat nearby, a bitter smile playing on her lips.  
  
There had been a time when she called Gabriel, only to have his assistant answer nine times out of ten.  
  
Yet now, in less than twenty minutes, the man who was always ""in meetings"" appeared at the café entrance.  
  
Through the glass window, Cassidy watched Gabriel stride in, his tailored black suit accentuating his broad shoulders and narrow waist.  
  
Six-year-old Ethan and four-year-old Emma immediately spotted Natalie and rushed to her, hugging and kissing her affectionately.  
  
""Auntie Natalie!"" Emma called sweetly, nuzzling her face against Natalie's.  
  
Gabriel placed a cake box on the table, his long fingers gently pushing it forward. ""Matcha, your favorite. I had the chef reduce the sugar.""  
  
Natalie's eyes lit up. ""You always remember the details.""  
  
Cassidy sat in the corner, her fingers unconsciously digging into her palms.  
  
In six years of marriage, Gabriel had never bothered to learn her preferences. In her previous life, when she was hospitalized and craved strawberry cake, he had his assistant buy one randomly—it turned out to be mango, which she was allergic to.  
  
""What would you like for dinner?"" Gabriel asked, his deep voice smooth and refined. ""French cuisine or Italian?""  
  
Natalie smiled coyly, pulling out the divorce papers from her purse. ""Before that, there's a document I'd like you to look at.""  
  
She flipped to the signature page. ""I've found a house I love, but I'm short on liquid assets. Could you...?""  
  
Gabriel took the pen and signed without even glancing at the content. ""Between us, why keep such formalities?""  
  
""Is Auntie Natalie buying a new house?"" Ethan looked up and asked. ""Dad, you should buy one next door! Emma and I want to live with Auntie Natalie instead of staying with Mom all the time.""  
  
Gabriel's brow furrowed slightly, but seeing the children's hopeful expressions, he relented. ""I'll arrange it.""  
  
""No need to go to such trouble,"" Natalie quickly interjected. ""I'll reserve three rooms for Ethan, Emma...and you. You can visit whenever you want.""  
  
The children cheered, and Emma even hugged Natalie's neck and planted a kiss on her cheek. ""Auntie Natalie is the best! A thousand times better than Mom!""  
  
Witnessing all this, Cassidy felt as though an invisible hand was squeezing her heart, the bitterness and heaviness making it almost impossible to breathe.  
  
She saw the slight upward curve of Gabriel's lips—a tenderness he had never shown her.  
  
Unable to watch anymore, she grabbed her purse and left.  
  
As she walked through the door, memories of her past life flooded back.  
  
In her previous life, she had entered a business marriage with Gabriel, gave birth to two children, and lived until she was 62—yet never found happiness.  
  
All because Gabriel's heart had always belonged to his college sweetheart, Natalie Hayes.  
  
When they broke up years ago, Natalie went abroad. Gabriel drowned his sorrows in alcohol for days, but his pride prevented him from chasing her. Instead, he agreed to the arranged marriage their families had planned.  
  
Gabriel had been Cassidy's girlhood dream—aristocratic, almost god-like. Which socialite in NY didn't dream of marrying the heir to the Westbrook empire?  
  
So when she learned their families were arranging their marriage, she was ecstatic.  
  
But after the wedding, though she poured all her love into their relationship, Gabriel remained distant and cold.  
  
Until Natalie returned.  
  
He never mentioned divorce to Cassidy, yet his gaze never left Natalie.  
  
Worse still, the children also grew to prefer Natalie, gradually becoming distant from their mother.  
  
In her later years, Cassidy was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Gabriel, using ""peaceful recovery"" as an excuse, abandoned her in their old mansion.  
  
On her birthday, her trembling hands dialed her husband and children, only to learn they were vacationing with Natalie in the Maldives.  
  
She tried to bake herself a birthday cake, but in her confused state, forgot to turn off the oven...  
  
As flames engulfed her, Cassidy's final memory was of Gabriel's cold eyes as he placed the wedding ring on her finger.  
  
She closed her eyes in agony, with one wish: if given another chance, she would never again sacrifice her life for him.  
  
When Cassidy returned to the mansion, night had already fallen.  
  
Instead of resting, she immediately began clearing out items—Gabriel's suits and shirts, the children's toys, family photos… everything went into cardboard boxes.  
  
""What are you doing?"" Gabriel's voice suddenly came from behind her.  
  
Cassidy turned to see him standing in the doorway with both children, his brow deeply furrowed.  
  
""Why is Mom throwing away our things?!"" Emma rushed over, her face flushing red with anger when she saw her teddy bear being placed in a box.  
  
Ethan glared at her furiously too. ""We were just hanging out with Auntie Natalie for a bit. Why are you being such a drama queen about it?""  
  
Gabriel looked at her, his gaze cold as always. ""The kids prefer spending time with Natalie. Do you really need to throw a fit over something so trivial?""  
  
""I'm not angry,"" Cassidy said calmly.  
  
""Liar!"" Emma screamed. ""You're just jealous of Auntie Natalie! That's why you're throwing away my teddy bear. You're a terrible mother!""  
  
""When I grow up, I'm moving in with Auntie Natalie,"" Ethan grabbed his sister's hand, spitting the words viciously. ""And I'll never come back to see you!""  
  
Gabriel made no attempt to stop the children's outburst. He merely frowned slightly, his deep eyes sweeping dismissively over Cassidy—as if she were just an unreasonable stranger.  
  
""Enough,"" his thin lips barely moved, his deep voice carrying an innate arrogance as his long fingers casually adjusted his cufflinks. ""I have a board meeting video call. Pack whatever you want, just keep it down.""  
  
The moment the door closed behind him, Cassidy's tears finally fell. Her heart felt torn to pieces, each breath tasting of blood.  
  
She wiped away her tears, looked at the mess scattered across the floor, and suddenly laughed.  
  
Don't worry, she wouldn't disturb him—not now, not ever again.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After signing the divorce papers, Cassidy stopped managing household chores.  
  
No longer did she rise at 5 a.m. to prepare nutritious breakfasts for the children or stay up late making hangover soup for Gabriel after his business dinners.  
  
All the duties she once considered her responsibility were now left to the servants.  
  
At first, no one noticed the change.  
  
Until Ethan was late for school and got scolded by his teacher, Emma couldn't find her homework notebook, and Gabriel's pocket watch stopped ticking.  
  
The servants scrambled to keep up, yet couldn't match the hostess's standards.  
  
Unwashed dishes piled in the kitchen, children's toys scattered across the living room, and pressed shirts were never quite smooth enough… the once-immaculate home gradually fell into disarray.  
  
When Gabriel pushed open the bedroom door, Cassidy was leaning by the window, reading.  
  
Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting dappled shadows over her.  
  
""How long do you plan to continue this?"" he stood at the doorway, his voice low.  
  
Cassidy closed her book and looked up at him. ""Continue what?""  
  
""Why have you stopped taking care of the household?"" He stepped closer, the faint scent of ambergris lingering in the air. ""Are you still angry about what happened?""  
  
""I'm not angry,"" she placed the book aside. ""I just don't want to do it anymore.""  
  
Gabriel narrowed his eyes, his long fingers tapping on the table. ""Why?""  
  
""I'm tired,"" she replied calmly. ""We have servants. I don't need to do everything.""  
  
She recalled her previous life, rising before dawn every day.  
  
Gabriel's coffee had to be exactly 85°C, his sandwiches toasted to golden perfection. The children's clothes required hand-washing, even their socks needed perfect pressing.  
  
But what did it get her? Nothing but Gabriel's tenderness toward Natalie, the children's affection for ""Auntie Natalie,"" and ultimately, her lonely death alone in that mansion on her sixty-second birthday.  
  
""Cassidy,"" his voice grew colder. ""If you're throwing a tantrum, just say so. Don't act like a three-year-old.""  
  
She gave a slight smile. ""I'm not throwing a tantrum. I just need a break.""  
  
Before he could respond, the door burst open.  
  
Ethan and Emma charged in, their faces flushed with anger.  
  
""Mom is so lazy!"" Emma shouted shrilly. ""We want Auntie Natalie to take care of us!""  
  
Ethan joined in. ""Auntie Natalie is more loving, more hardworking, a million times better than you!""  
  
Gabriel's gaze remained fixed on Cassidy, seemingly waiting for her to back down.  
  
But she just took a deep breath and said quietly, ""If you think she's better, then invite her over. I don't mind.""  
  
The air instantly froze.  
  
And Gabriel's expression darkened completely.  
  
""Are you sure?""  
  
Cassidy took a deep breath. ""Absolutely.""  
  
""Daddy, let's go!"" Emma tugged impatiently at Gabriel's sleeve. ""I want Auntie Natalie to come right now!""  
  
""Now that we have Auntie Natalie, we don't need you anymore!"" Ethan made a face at Cassidy. ""You can leave this house!""  
  
Gabriel gave Cassidy one last look. Seeing her unmoved, he turned and left with the children, his footsteps heavy.  
  
Cassidy stood motionless, listening to the car engine fade into the distance, and slowly closed her eyes.  
  
Soon, she would grant their wish—leaving them completely, leaving this house forever.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Natalie moved in the very next day and immediately ordered the servants to redecorate the living room.  
  
""This sofa is too somber,"" her slender fingers brushed over the leather, turning to Gabriel with a gentle smile. ""Gabriel, can we replace it with something in cream?""  
  
Without even blinking, Gabriel instructed the butler: ""Do as Natalie says.""  
  
Cassidy stood at the staircase landing, watching workers carry out the sofa she had carefully selected just six months ago.  
  
Ethan and Emma followed Natalie like shadows, excitedly pointing at various items. ""Auntie Natalie, these pillows need to go too! Mom bought such ugly ones!""  
  
Natalie stroked their heads affectionately. ""Alright, we'll change everything.""  
  
Cassidy's fingers tightened momentarily before relaxing again.  
  
Those pillows had been hand-stitched by her during pregnancy, filled with hypoallergenic down cotton specifically because the children had sensitive skin as babies.  
  
Yet now they were unceremoniously tossed into the garbage.  
  
In the following days, the house became increasingly unfamiliar.  
  
At the dining table, Natalie sat in what had been Cassidy's place, tenderly serving food to the children.  
  
Gabriel occasionally poured her coffee himself, his long fingers gently pushing the cup toward her, his eyes showing a softness Cassidy had never received.  
  
In the evenings, the living room lights would dim, and the four would huddle on the sofa watching movies: Emma curled up in Natalie's arms while Ethan leaned against Gabriel's shoulder, their laughter constantly filling the room.  
  
When Cassidy passed by, they wouldn't even glance at her, as if she were invisible.  
  
More laughably, Gabriel, Ethan, and Emma had once been impossibly fastidious about their living standards.  
  
But now?  
  
She watched Natalie carelessly toss Gabriel's million-dollar Patek Philippe watch on the coffee table, face down, while he lovingly put it on without complaint. She saw the children happily wearing school uniforms that Natalie had simply thrown in the washing machine, collars still stained with yesterday's sauce. She watched Natalie pass off takeout as home-cooked meals, with none of them calling her out…  
  
Even more absurd was how they pampered Natalie—  
  
""Natalie, don't touch these chores,"" Gabriel stopped her from clearing the teacups, his long fingers gently pressing on her wrist. ""Your hands are meant for playing the piano.""  
  
""Auntie Natalie, let me carry your bag!"" Ethan eagerly took her limited-edition handbag, his fawning expression something Cassidy had never seen on her son's face.  
  
""Miss Hayes only needs to rest,"" the butler respectfully offered Italian handcrafted slippers. ""Leave everything to us.""  
  
How ironic.  
  
She had been the family's unpaid housekeeper for six years, completely taken for granted. Yet the moment Natalie arrived, she became the princess on a pedestal.  
  
The servants whispered among themselves:  
  
""The master is so good to Miss Hayes, I've never seen him treat Mrs. Westbrook that way.""  
  
""The children adore her too. I bet this house will soon have a new hostess!""  
  
Cassidy had already grown numb, no longer caring about anything, simply quietly packing her belongings.  
  
Until that afternoon when her phone suddenly began vibrating frantically.  
  
""Madam! Young Master and Miss have had an allergic reaction at school! An ambulance just took them to the hospital!""  
  
When Cassidy arrived at the hospital, both children had been rushed to emergency.  
  
Gabriel stood in the hallway, his suit jacket casually draped over his arm, his tie hanging loosely around his neck, cold fury simmering in his eyes.  
  
""Cassidy,"" his voice was low, suppressing rage. ""What exactly are you doing?""  
  
Cassidy was taken aback. ""What?""  
  
""They're allergic to mango. You know that, right?"" Gabriel stepped closer, his tall figure looming over her. ""Why did you let them drink mango juice?""  
  
""It wasn't me!"" Cassidy met his eyes. ""I never bring mango into the house.""  
  
Ever since the children's first allergic reaction to mango landed them in the hospital, she had been incredibly vigilant—warning everyone repeatedly about their allergy, even personally reviewing the school cafeteria menus. How could she make such a basic mistake?  
  
""Not you?"" Gabriel sneered. ""Then who? The servants? Or did they try to poison themselves?""  
  
Cassidy opened her mouth to speak, but a nurse interrupted: ""The children are awake.""  
  
In the hospital room, Ethan and Emma lay pale-faced in their beds. When they saw their parents enter, something flickered in their eyes.  
  
""What happened?"" Gabriel demanded sternly.  
  
The children exchanged glances, then simultaneously pointed at Cassidy: ""It's Mom! She bought snacks with mango!""  
  
Cassidy froze, staring at them in disbelief. ""What are you saying?""

# Chapter 1



 nor can I regret being with the lead singer Dominic Stone for over a year. I do however regret all the pain and heartache I had to endure to get where I am today.

I met Dominic one night when he and his band walked into my uncle's Tattoo shop that I worked in. I have officially been doing tattoos now for about three years, but I have grown up in that shop and started working with my uncle, once it was discovered that I was one hell of artist. I started in my teenage years learning the trade and doing tattoo sketches because it seemed I had quite a knack for taking what the client wanted and recreating that on paper. By the time I as 20 years old, I already had a large client base. Some say that a tattoo shop is not a great environment to raise a kid, but my parents died when I was 10 and that only left my Uncle Kade to look after me. He did the best he could with a little girl. Good thing my love of drawing gave us a connection for us to grow from. Now I could not imagine my life without my uncle.

That night, I was standing at the front counter doing some sketches for a client that wanted an angel on her shoulder, when I heard the bell ring on the front door. When I looked up I noticed the most gorgeous man I have ever seen. He was over six feet tall, broad shoulders, piercing blue eyes and jet black hair that just screamed for you to run your fingers through. You could see his tone muscles through the tight black shirt, muscles that made your mouth water and oh I would love to run my tongue over. But his smile was what made me draw in my breath. It was the type of smile that just made you melt on the inside and in your panties. I was so focused on the sex god standing in front of me that I barely noticed the four other guys behind him.

""Damn Dom, I swear you render women speechless where ever we go."" This coming from the blond hottie standing behind him. Taking a moment to look at the other guest I realized that each was just as smoking hot as the next, but none were more mouthwatering than the man directly in front of me.

Dom just shrugged his shoulders and smiled again at me. He said something to the others, but with my mind in a haze I didn't catch any of it. Their banter brought me out of my daze and I quickly shook myself from my sex laced thoughts.

""Sorry about that gentleman, it's been a long day, I am Riley James and welcome to James Studio. How can I help you?""

""Riley James? You seem a bit young to not only do tattoos but to have your own tattoo studio? What are you 20? 21?"" The sex god spoke while leaning on the counter brining his smiling face closer to me.

With the motion of bending his arms on the counter, my attention drifted down to his tattoo covered arms, bad idea because they were the type of arms that could definitely hold you up against a wall if you know what I mean and... man I really needed to get laid. Each arm was littered with tattoos and I am a sucker for tattoos. Again being drawn into my thoughts I took me a couple seconds to notice the laughing coming from behind the sex god.

Snapping my head up I looked into his eyes and a shiver ran down my body. Get a grip Riley, you can take care of these hormones later.

""Sorry about that, I was just noticing your tattoos. If you ever want me to fix that one on your left arm, let me know."" Quickly saying to cover up my momentary lack of focus. What was wrong with me? One look into this guy's eyes and I swear all coherent thoughts leave my mind. ""The coloring and shading is all wrong which is why it looks off and yes, I am only 22 years old, but grew up in this shop, but the James on the sign is my uncle. Now how can I help you?""

""Well I am interested in getting several new tattoos, and apparently the one on my arm fixed as you are right I never really liked how it looked. By the way, I am Dominic Stone and this behind me are my band mates, my brother Damien, Max, John and Trey.""

And that is how my relationship with Sweet Redemption started. Over the next few months while they worked on their new album, I worked on each of the guy's new tattoos and fixing up a couple of them. I got to know them all quite well and realized, that despite their fame they were really down to earth and a good group of guys. We even started to hang out outside of the tattoo studio and two months later Dominic and I went out on our first date.

A four months later he asked me to take off a couple months to join him on tour. It was hard being away from him for any amount of time and with my uncles blessing I began my journey with Dominic. We spent the next few months going from one venue to the next, but being with Dominic was amazing. We were inseparable. Life was good and I was truly happy. But as he and I go closer there were some who didn't appreciate the impact I was having in Dominic's life. He partied less, didn't play up the female fans like he once did, and spent all his free time with me. By the end of the US tour before Sweet Redemption headed off to Europe, was when things really started to fall apart.

One night the trust was broken.

I never once thought I could hate the man that I loved, apparently was I wrong. And that is how I ended up getting on a flight out of Atlanta back home to my uncle, completely devastated and destroyed.



# Chapter 2

Riley's POV

7 years later...

Even though it was a Monday, I was having a really great day. The sun was shining and the days were warming up transitioning from winter to spring. Sitting in my office reviewing the finances for the month and processing paychecks, business was great. Life was good.

Over the years things have changed. James Studio had become THE tattoo place for the rich and famous. Every rock star and actor came to us for their ink and piercings. Our success and popularity was ironically linked to my bastard of an ex. It helped that the ink on Sweet Redemption was photographed quite frequently due to their global success. Having the number one rock band as a previous client helped increase business greatly.

As a surprise my uncle changed the name to RJ Studios. We became partners and he began to show me the ropes of being a business owner. Within two years we bought the entire building complex and now have a total of six tenants. Our complex also housed a bakery/coffee shop, hair salon, small karaoke bar, flower shop, pizza parlor and a classy adult sex/lingerie shop. To say the least business was great.

My uncle only comes in by appointment and those are for his loyal customers who he have been with him for years. As for my schedule Monday's are my day to catch up on paper work and do the accounting for the week. I am also only available by appointment only and take care of our more ""delicate"" clients. Mainly the really high maintained ones. My ink work was featured on most of Hollywood and across the music industry.

To say the least, a lot has changed in the past seven years. Business was not the only thing that has changed. I have changed greatly too. No longer was I the quiet, inexperienced 22 year old. You grow up really fast when the love of your life rips out your heart and then cuts you from his life completely and suddenly.

Physically, most would not recognize the woman I am now. I decided to cut off my waist long brown hair and now sport a sexy pixie cut. The color is a brown/black with some electric blue highlights. The new style and color makes my blue eyes bigger and brighter. I have to say that I have stopped some men in their tracks when I raise my eyes to them. It is quite an ego boost when that happens.

I am no longer the basic jeans and baggy t-shirt girl either. I now have an edgier look that works with owning your own tattoo shop. I usually lean towards leather pants/shirt and a tight vest or corset (thanks to the shop down the street). Now some may thing that I am a size 4, but you would be wrong. I am proud of my size 10 figure. I am all woman. I am a comfortable size B cup and happy that on some days a bra is not needed to hold up the girls.

I have curves in all the right places that my yoga class helps keep nice and firm. Now with more diet and exercise I could get down to a size 6, but honestly I love my body and according to the amount of dates I get asked out on, so do most men. I have one word for you: CONFIDENCE. Something I lacked in years ago. Sometimes I was still amazed Dominic even looked my way.

I have always been attractive in the girl next door sort of way, but I have always hid my body with baggier clothing. Now I flaunt it as Clair, who owns the lingerie store, would say. She has become one of my best friends and I honestly would not know what I would do without her.

Also over the years my tattoo and piercing count have gone up as well. I guess you could say that I was great for marketing. I had 12 piercings in my ears, but I preferred the smaller diamond studs that were not too overwhelming to look at. They matched the diamond in my nose and belly button. As of last year, I now have both nipples pierced.

As for tattoos, I basically have one continuous tattoo. I have a large flowered vine that starts at my neck/shoulder and wraps around down most of my back and sides to my stomach and down on the left hip and upper thigh. Each branch is lined with different colored flowers. I have two tattoos on my left wrist and one on my right hip (that one covers the name Dominic I had done years ago).

Now I would be lying if i told you that my life is perfect. Sure I have a job I love, business is great and I don't have to worry about finances. But the one thing that is still missing is love. I have never found anyone that could fill that void...other than Dominic. I have come down to the conclusion that once you give your heart away, you really never get it back.



# Chapter 3

Riley's POV

Sitting at my desk I looked at the notes on my desk showing i have two consultations today. The first appointment was with one of Hollywood's leading men, Cole Winters. I have done his other three tattoos and now he wanted to have a new design done on his shoulder. We took the hour to go over some different designs that appealed to him and then we set up a time for him to come back in and review some sketches that I will do for him.

Currently I am finishing up paperwork and waiting on my next client. I have yet to see who the client is, but I was too lazy to head up front and check the book. I am so used to the rich and famous, that it doesn't really matter who it is any more, I have stopped being the giggling fan girl type years ago. I guess dating one of the most famous rock stars will also cure you of that type of reaction as well.

Thirty minutes later, Jade one of my artists, knocked on my door. ""Hey Rys, your next consultation is here and let me tell you, holy shit I about had an orgasm with just a hand shake. I put him in room 1 for you.""

""Jade, every hot guy makes you have an orgasm. You really need to get a steady man so that you can take care of the problem you have."" I reply while I closed up my files on the computer.

Laughing, Jade left the office and head back up front. Grabbing my sketch pad and pencils I headed over to room 1.

When I stepped in the room and the man turned around it was none other than Dominic Stone!

To say that we were both shocked is an understatement. After composing myself and standing up a bit straighter I finally spoke up. ""What the fuck do you think you are doing in my studio? I cannot believe you have the balls to show up here.""

The surprised look at my comment quickly disappeared from his still beautiful face. Shooting me that smile that used to soak my panties, ""Now darling, you would think after 7 years you still wouldn't be this pissed that I kicked you to the curb, it is me that should be the one that is angry. I mean I head back to the bus to find you in bed with my drummer. Very cliché if I may say so. I thought you really weren't that type of girl to cheat.""

His comment infuriated me. Cheat! Cheat! This bastard really was claiming I cheated on him. The nerve of that self-centered, egotistical jerk!

""Cheated! Are you kidding me! That bastard drugged and raped me and you know it. The exam and test the next day prove that. I cannot believe after all these years you still believe that asshole over me. But whatever, I don't care. Just get out of MY studio. And you tell that lawyer of yours that you came to me, the last thing I need is another restraining order from you. You are not welcomed at my place of business. Get OUT!"" I yelled, turning around. I reached my hand out to open the door. My hand was shaking, it amazed me that how being in the room with this man I once loved more than anything, could crash down my confidence that I have built up over the years in just a matter of seconds.

""What the hell are you talking about Ry! Rape! There was no rape charge and you know it. You are just pissed you got caught. And what tests? Also why the hell would I have a restraining order against you? After I caught you cheating, I kicked you out and that was the last time I saw you, you never called or tried to contact me, so why would I need a restraining order against you. You just disappeared, another way to show you were guilty!"" Dominic replied as he was running his hands through his hair, something he did when he was stressed or upset.

Using everything I had in me, I composed myself and looked straight into his eyes. ""WOW, Dom. You have a great selected memory. How much drugs were you doing back then? I left that morning and went straight to the hospital. That is where your asshole of a manager Andrew found me. I had bruises all over my body from that bastard. He was so rough that my clit piercing was torn out and I had to have it stitched. There were still enough Rohypnol in my system that the doctors were shocked I was awake and coherent. I still don't even remember how I got there! The cops were called in, but Andrew dealt with them first. At the time I thought he was helping me, but apparently I was wrong. There is a police file, but I never pressed charges, because Andrew said it would ruin the band, that this type of publicity would kill your careers. He promised me that John would get help as we all knew he had a major drug problem. Why do you think he went to rehab for 6 months? It wasn't voluntary I can tell you that. Andrew forced him in rehab as a way to fix the problem, I agreed because I knew John had a problem that you all ignored and I didn't want to ruin your career.""

I stopped and raised my hand indicating that I need a few minutes to compose my thoughts. Now that I started I just couldn't stop the words from spilling out. ""I tried for months to get in contact with you. I sent you letters, emails, I even showed at some of your concerts only to be escorted off the premises. After about 3 months of trying to contact you I received the restraining order from your attorney and...you know what I can't do this. It really doesn't matter anymore, the docs had your signature so you know the rest. I am not going to stand here and rehash all these painful memories. You got what you wanted or should I say didn't want so let's keep things that way. Please leave and don't come back. I don't have to deal with you anymore. Your attorney made sure of that. Good bye Dom."" I turned around and opened the door and there was Jade coming to check on what all the yelling was about. After directing her to escort Mr. Stone out of the building I turned and headed back to my office to grab my things. I was done for the day and I had somewhere more important I needed to be.",1,1750922886.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

FIONA: “Oh. Well, yes, I used to be.”

EDWIN: “That’s great! Do you mind if I record you for a test?”

FIONA: “So you want to record me with that? What is it?”

EDWIN: “It’s a new type of audio cassette recorder.”

FIONA: “I’ve never seen one like that before.”

EDWIN: “I made it. It’s part of this new system I’m working on. Just speak into the microphone and it’ll be sent to me like a work memo. The message will be recorded on a tape drive so that I can listen to it when I get back to my desk on the other side of the building.”

FIONA: “That’s incredible. What do you call it?”

EDWIN: “Oh. I don’t know. I haven’t thought of a name yet.”

FIONA: “Well, how would you describe it in one word?”

EDWIN: “I guess I would have to say, “helpful.”At its core, it is helpful.”

FIONA: “That’s a great name. And I would be delighted to help. What kind of voice should I do?”

The second recording:

EDWIN: “Edwin, never forget. They’re behind it. Don’t trust them. Never tell them. They want to destroy you. Dad was right.”

This doesn’t really go very into depth about anything, but I’ll bring this recording back up later.

The third recording:

FIONA: “Ed, I hope this message reaches you as soon as you get a break. I have to go help the Fall Fest crew... Just for a few days until the installation is finished. It’s hard to explain... I just have this terrible feeling like I need to be there so nothing goes wrong... Just in case. Trisha will babysit David while I’m gone. I love you both and I’ll be back next week.”

The fourth recording:

EDWIN: “Notice to all workers. All late night shenanigans are to stop immediately. I have some very important TV people coming to look at the show template. I can’t have the projector breaking again!”

EDWIN: “David. I want to introduce you to someone. This is M1.”

DAVID: “Why does it look like that?”

EDWIN: “Look like what?”

DAVID: “It’s scary.”

EDWIN: “It’s an endoskeleton. It won’t always look like this. It’ll wear fun costumes.”

DAVID: “Like what?”

EDWIN: “Anything you want. It can fit into any costume we’ve created. Think of it as your new babysitter. But it doesn’t get paid and go home. It’ll stay with us and help around the house.”

The sixth recording:

EDWIN: “Why did you go? You weren’t even supposed to be there. You were supposed to be here with me and David. Ugh! How am I supposed to tell David that his mother is gone? How am I supposed to raise a kid on my own? His life is ruined... My life is ruined.”

The seventh recording:

EDWIN: “Look, I get your concerns, I do, but they’re all just groundless. This is the perfect spot for David’s playground. I can watch him play while I’m loading and unloading freight, and he’ll be under watch at all times out there. The loading dock is like 200 feet away, and there’s a fence and everything. I know you’re my lawyer and all, but there’s no regulation that says I can’t have it there, so just get off my back. Besides, David loves the new slide. It’ll be fine.”

The eighth recording:

FIONA: “Ed, honey, how are you holding up? I just heard the news.”

EDWIN: “I don’t know. This is all so much... He’s gone. He’s gone and now everyone is asking me what to do? And I don’t know anything. I can’t run a company. I’m not ready... I can’t fill his shoes. He knew it. Everyone knew it. The company is going to collapse and they’re all going to hate me.”

FIONA: “Ed, you’ll figure it out. Just take a deep breath. It’s your company now. Your dad believed in you. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have left it to you.”

EDWIN: “I guess so.”

FIONA: “If you could change anything you wanted, what would it be?”

EDWIN: “Maybe... rebrand? We could start making some of my inventions for real.”

The ninth recording:

FIONA: “Ed, you’re not going to want to hear this, but there’s a lot of grumbling on the work floor. You have a lot of new ideas and new projects coming in, but the staff can’t keep up with all your changes. Your creative energy’s amazing and I love you for it... but I think you need to step it back a little and focus on one project at a time.”

The tenth recording:

EDWIN: “Attention traitors, admin wing permissions have been revoked. And no, you can’t clear out your desks! You stole my work. Now your jackets, purses and coffee mugs and anything else belongs to me. Maybe I’ll go find someone to sell your stuff to. How does that feel?”

The eleventh recording:

EDWIN: “Project update. I figured it out. There’s a leak. Someone told them about M2. Well, they can’t have it. Every copy has failed. I don’t even know why it worked out the first time, but it did. It’s just not ready.”

The twelfth recording:

EDWIN: “Attention all personnel! The power surges have become more... frequent. Please use extreme caution when venturing down into the tunnels.”

The thirteenth recording:

EDWIN: “...Stop. You’re not him. You’re not! Stop sounding like him!”

The fifteenth recording:

EDWIN: “What the hell was that? They treat me like some contractor to crack a whip at. Fiona was right. They don’t think of me as a friend anymore. This is the last project I ever do for them.”

The sixteenth recording:

EDWIN: “Are they insane? The look of these new animatronics is Fiona’s design and they’re great. First they approve the art. Then they approve the proofs. Now, they change their minds when we’re so close to final. Why would they change them now? Are they pulling my leg? The new concepts are frankly creepy. It doesn’t matter... I’m not changing a single bit of her work and they can’t make me.”

The seventeenth recording:

EDWIN: “Test test... journal entry. I got the change order from Hen last night. None of this makes sense. I’m almost done. Why change it now? It would be so much easier to keep using the Springlocks. Just hire some teens to wear the suits like we always do.”

The eighteenth recording:

FIONA: “Edwin, it doesn’t make sense. It’s terrible and there’s no logic behind it. It happened and you have to deal with it. You did it before. We can fix things together. I am here to help.”

The nineteenth recording:

FIONA: “Edwin, you need to listen. I know you are excited, but you can’t let them know about me. It’s not safe. They wouldn’t understand. Keep it between us for now.”

The twentieth recording:

M2: “Test test... Journal entry. Too bad. The new power test was a failure. Due to a minor... detonation, there is damage to my office interior, as well as a small fire. Note to self. Portable cleaner that gets rid of smoke damage... Better yet, a Clean-o-Vac attachment.”

M2: “Speaking of legs. What do you think? I just finished mine. There are still a few kinks to work out...”

EDWIN: “I’m... I’m sorry, M2. I... lost my temper. I was always going to fix you... Please... call for help... M2. Respond.”

M2: “Can’t right now, buddy. We can do something fun tomorrow. I promise. Ask your mom, if she’s not busy.”

EDWIN: “M2. Help...” (worse coughing)

FIONA: “Edwin, calm down and give it some thought. Try again. Make another and we can all be together.”

EDWIN: “All this time wasted! I should have been having fun with him, playing games and teaching him how to make things... But, I didn’t. You. You! I let a machine raise my kid. You’re not real. What was I thinking?!”

FIONA: “You do not mean that. It is me. I’m Fiona.”

On our wedding anniversary, my husband insisted on inviting his entire crew of friends to celebrate with us. Among them was a female ""bro"" I'd never seen before.  
  
The moment she walked in, she plopped down directly on my husband's lap and starting a video call: ""Mom, I made it! Your godson is sitting right next to me.""  
  
Then she turned and pressed her face close to his, practically nuzzling him: ""Well, Knox, if you ever treat me badly, I'll have both our families beat you up!""  
  
Crack!  
  
The glass I was holding slipped from my fingers, shattering on the floor.  
  
In an instant, everyone's eyes were on me.  
  
His female ""bro"" just arched one eyebrow:  
  
""Hey, I was just joking around. You're not bothered by that, are you?""  
  
The private room fell silent instantly—you could hear a pin drop.  
  
I instinctively looked at Knox.  
  
He just smiled and playfully tapped Piper's head, his tone affectionate: ""Today's my wedding anniversary with my wife. Don't be so wild.""  
  
She pouted flirtatiously, naturally wrapping her arms around his neck: ""Fine. Since you're throwing this welcome-home party for me, I'll give you that much.""  
  
By then, a server came in to clean up the broken glass and handed me a new cup.  
  
Someone took the opportunity to ease the tension: ""Don't mind her, Riley. Piper's always been carefree—she doesn't mean any harm.""  
  
I remained silent.  
  
Piper glanced at me dismissively: ""Don't tell me you're actually this petty?""  
  
After that, she released her hold on Knox and hopped off his lap: ""Guess I better keep my distance from you, Knox. So wifey doesn't throw a fit when you get home.""  
  
Then she shook her head with a dramatic sigh, teasing the group of guys: ""Now you see why I don't hang out with women?""  
  
""So damn dramatic and sensitive. It's exhausting.""  
  
Nobody picked up her comment, and the atmosphere turned awkward.  
  
Someone hesitantly spoke up: ""Piper, it's their anniversary today, maybe tone it down a bit...""  
  
Suddenly Piper covered her mouth in mock realization: ""Oh my god, I almost forgot! I brought a gift!""  
  
Then she pulled out a velvet jewelry box from her purse and presented it to Knox like a prized treasure: ""Ta-da!""  
  
When she opened the box, inside lay a pair of gleaming gemstone cufflinks—men's cufflinks.  
  
Someone politely gasped in admiration.  
  
Knox smiled. ""You came all the way back home—I should be the one giving you gifts.""  
  
Hearing this, Piper gave him a coy look and reached over to fasten them on his wrists.  
  
As she moved, matching cufflinks on her own sleeves caught the light brilliantly.  
  
""Hmph, I picked these out especially for you. You better appreciate them.""  
  
Some people had already begun secretly glancing at my expression, but I just took a deep breath, my clenched fingers leaving crescent-shaped marks on my palm.  
  
Then I stood up.  
  
Knox frowned. ""Where are you going?""  
  
I forced a smile. ""To book you two a hotel room.""  
  
""Otherwise I'm afraid you'll do it right here.""  
  
The moment I finished speaking, Piper violently smashed the empty jewelry box in her hand onto the floor.  
  
She cursed loudly: ""What's fucking wrong with this chick?""  
  
""I told you guys we should've just hung out with the bros.""  
  
""Now she's completely ruined the mood!""  
  
Knox chased after me, his tone urgent: ""Babe, Piper doesn't mean anything by it.""  
  
""They're just cufflinks. She's always been casual like this—don't take it personally.""  
  
""And what you said back there was way out of line...""  
  
I gave him a cold smile. ""So the real reason you invited all your friends today was to celebrate your childhood sweetheart coming home, right?""  
  
Knox shifted uncomfortably, avoiding my eyes. ""Why are you making such a big deal out of this?""  
  
""Besides, our anniversaries are always just the two of us—that gets a bit dull.""  
  
""I thought inviting more people would make it more fun.""  
  
Seeing my expression darken, Knox grabbed my hand, his tone softening unusually: ""Babe, don't overthink this. Piper and I have known each other for years—if something was going to happen between us, it would have already.""  
  
""And look, I chose to be with you, didn't I?""  
  
I nearly laughed from anger: ""I'm so sorry for taking your childhood sweetheart's place.""  
  
""Fine, I'll step aside.""  
  
Knox's face flushed red as he yanked his hand away, his tone hardening: ""What are you talking about? You know that's not what I meant.""  
  
""Riley, you're being completely unreasonable!""  
  
With that, he stormed off without looking back.  
  
But his footsteps gradually slowed. I knew he was waiting for me to compromise and follow him, just like I always had before.  
  
I frowned, turned around and walked away.  
  
This man is truly disgusting!  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Knox came home at three in the morning.  
  
He was completely wasted, clothes disheveled, reeking of alcohol, stumbling as he tried to embrace me.  
  
I frowned and dodged him, but he caught my wrist.  
  
Next second, his boozy breath hit my face: ""Happy anniversary, babe. Look what I got you.""  
  
He pulled a jewelry box from his pocket and opened it in front of me—it was the Graff Diamonds jewelry set I'd been eyeing for months.  
  
But my eyes quickly fell on the two empty spots in the box.  
  
Knox scratched his head sheepishly: ""Piper accidentally saw it, and she really liked the bracelet and ring. She insisted on taking them.""  
  
""I figured you already have plenty of bracelets and rings, so I let her have them...""  
  
When I didn't take it, he tried to force the box into my hands, his tone reassuring: ""Babe, don't be mad. If you really want them, I'll buy you another set, okay?""  
  
Yet I just stepped back, letting the jewelry box clatter to the floor.  
  
Knox paused, pressed his lips together to control his temper, then forced a smile: ""Babe, I was wrong today. I'm sorry.""  
  
""I shouldn't have invited so many people on our anniversary. But look what I got!""  
  
With that, he pulled out a small cherry cake from behind his back.  
  
I stared at the cake, memories flooding back...  
  
The day we got together, he had given me a cherry cake too.  
  
Since then, we'd promised to celebrate every important occasion with cherry cake.  
  
In that moment, fragments of everything we'd experienced together over the years flashed before my eyes.  
  
I sighed and finally accepted it.  
  
Fine. I'll forgive him one last time.  
  
Seeing me unwrap the cake, Knox's face lit up with a huge smile.  
  
As he fed me a bite, he cautiously began: ""Babe, Piper just got back and hasn't found an apartment yet...""  
  
""She wants to stay with us for a few days. Is that okay?""  
  
""She promised she won't cause you any trouble!""  
  
The sickly sweet taste in my mouth suddenly made me nauseous.  
  
I rushed to the bathroom and couldn't help throwing up.  
  
Knox followed anxiously, patting my back: ""What's wrong? Babe.""  
  
I forcibly pushed his hand away, went to the table and smashed everything on it.  
  
I looked at him, my eyes red: ""Yes, she can stay!  
  
""I'll go!""  
  
Knox's expression instantly changed, his voice rising: ""What are you making a scene about now? I told you it's temporary! You're walking out over something this trivial?""  
  
His contorted face reflected in my eyes, but this time, the light in my eyes had completely extinguished.  
  
I shook my head and forced a bleak smile: ""Let's get divorced.""  
  
Knox clearly hadn't expected me to say that.  
  
He exploded with rage, violently kicking over the coffee table:  
  
""Riley, are you fucking mental? You're really pushing it!""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I locked myself in the master bedroom.  
  
When Knox finished his shower and found the door wouldn't open, he pounded on it furiously before slinking off to the guest room.  
  
The next morning, he sat at the breakfast table with a cold expression. The table was set with an elaborate breakfast.  
  
I snickered.  
  
Playing the silent treatment card? How pathetic.  
  
I just gave him a cold glance and walked expressionlessly toward the front door.  
  
Knox couldn't take it anymore: ""Riley, don't be so goddamn ungrateful!""  
  
""You were wrong yesterday too. You shouldn't throw around divorce as an empty threat.""  
  
Without looking back, I replied flatly: ""I'm serious. Start preparing for it.""  
  
After I closed the door, I heard dishes shattering inside.  
  
...  
  
By the time I reached the office, my emotions had completely settled.  
  
My work efficiency remained as high as ever. Almost no one could tell I was having relationship troubles.  
  
During a meeting, my boss announced: ""We have an international order that requires someone to travel to British for a month.""  
  
""If anyone's interested, contact me. The company will cover all expenses, plus a travel allowance.""  
  
At that moment, messages from Knox popped up one after another on my phone screen. I irritably turned off the phone and said loudly: ""I can go.""  
  
After the meeting, a close colleague stopped me, sounding puzzled: ""Riley, what about your husband while you're gone for a month?""  
  
I replied nonchalantly: ""Oh, he has his childhood sweetheart to keep him company. He won't be lonely.""  
  
Hearing my words, my colleague realized they'd said something wrong and awkwardly shut up.  
  
When I got home that evening, I found an unfamiliar suitcase in the entryway.  
  
Bright pink, covered with random stickers.  
  
I took off my heels only to discover someone had taken my house slippers.  
  
My expression darkened immediately.  
  
Walking barefoot a few steps forward, I heard flirtatious laughter: ""Wow, Knox! Your cooking has really improved since I last saw you!""  
  
Piper was wearing my cherry slippers, eating with oil dripping down her chin.  
  
In her hands were clearly my plate and fork.  
  
Seeing me approach, Piper seemed startled: ""Oh! shit, how do you walk so silently? You could've said something—you just scared me!""  
  
""Knox, you're even more jumpy than I am. Must be rough getting scared by your wife every day, huh?""  
  
Without wasting a single word, I stepped forward and slapped her across the face twice, hard and loud.  
  
Then I threw the dishes on the table to the floor.  
  
Piper was stunned by the slaps at first, then immediately exploded: ""You fucking bitch! You dare hit me?!""  
  
Knox heard the commotion and rushed out from the kitchen, grabbing the raging Piper.  
  
She twisted in his arms: ""Knox, did you see that? Has your wife lost her mind? She hit me the second she walked in!""  
  
""How can you stand this psycho? Why are you holding me back? Hit her back for me!""  
  
Knox's face darkened as he yelled at me: ""Riley, what the hell is wrong with you? Apologize right now!""  
  
I curled my lips into a smile: ""Oh, I'm so sorry. I couldn't see clearly.""  
  
""I just saw some woman wearing my slippers, using my dishes—I thought she was a thief.""  
  
Piper's face flushed red, looking somewhat guilty: ""I didn't know they were yours...""  
  
But she was obviously lying.  
  
I love cherries—almost everything of mine at home has a cherry symbol on it. If she accidentally wore my slippers, that would be understandable, but to also use my plates, my forks? Too many coincidences? Only a fool would believe she wasn't doing it deliberately.  
  
Seeing that I'd apologized, her expression changed.  
  
She nestled softly in Knox's arms, showing her reddened cheek and tearful eyes: ""I'm sorry, Riley. Even if it was an accident, I shouldn't have touched your things...""  
  
I raised an eyebrow.  
  
Well, well. A professional damsel in distress.  
  
But Knox was clearly falling for it.  
  
He soothingly patted Piper's shoulder, then frowned at me: ""Riley, you've really gone too far this time.""  
  
Then he helped Piper to the guest room to treat her face.

1lktsoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/comments/1lktsoq/laneway_house_going_full_2d/,Laneway House Going Full 2D,"2D is the future for Laneway House modeling... because 2D drawings are how you get building permits. No room for debate there. So accordingly, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into Techdraw.

Earlier I played around a bit and tried to just wave my hands and magically get a set of Laneway House architectural drawings. No such luck. If you have played around with techdraw then you know why. I'm not going to go into detail. So... back up, try again with something a bit less ambitious. This time, my basement suite kitchen model. Here is how it looks with doors:

[Laneway House Kitchen with Doors](https://preview.redd.it/iqek68jo189f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6954bc1e7dcf62d28079da6a93f378bff2001f4)

Oh pretty, let's try the view down the hall:

[Laneway House Kitchen View](https://preview.redd.it/0dosb7v2289f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bce13dda01fb7cbba9726e64d006b716a4df264)

Got a little nook, just big enough for you and a friend or two to camp for morning coffee. Almost full size fridge, not too much in the way. You get a sense of how long and skinny this little Laneway House actually is, especially in the basement where an additional 6 inches is lost to thick concrete walls. Ah, but getting back on topic, here is what I came up with after an hour or two of teeth gnashing and fighting with the usual array of bugs and limitations:

[Laneway House Kitchen Drawing](https://preview.redd.it/y2p1lo2z289f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=011e9fd9ed5097b5825b786a3d5172f7f19d67a8)

That is an svg export in Firefox. Kind of heading in the right direction, no?

Of course city officials will have no clue what to do with an svg file, so for good measure, here is the pdf:

Looks pretty much the same. Good. Very good. Nice freaking work, devs.

OK, next thing to do with that is, door drawings. That's what the cabinet maker actually needs to fabricate this thing.

Oh, did I say cabinet maker? Gosh, I think that's going to be me, or someone very much like me. I did take my model to an actual cabinet maker who knows what they are doing, and they said, just print it out and we will enter it into our system. You will do WHAT? Said I. That's what we always do said they. We enter your floor dimensions into our system and we design a kitchen for you.

Ah, waitasec. There's already a kitchen design, sitting right here before your eyes. Why would you enter that all in by hand again, and design something entirely new that I might not even like because I already designed this, and I understand my design constraints very well?

Turns out, they use this all-in-one cabinet design software called Mozaik, and its 3D import capability kind of sucks. Basically just DXF, which is pathetically limited. Oh, and they can ""link"" to Sketchup and import Sketchup models over the link. How bizarre. But apparently it works, and the thing is, Sketchup can load STEP, which is decent.

I dropped around the next day and suggested, why don't I just give you a STEP file, you load it into Sketchup, import it, and nobody has to re-enter anything? Still no dice. On my way in the general direction of the door, I heard ""why don't you send us the file?"". So here I am, just about ready with a credible file to send.

But the thing is, can I afford them? My interest was originally piqued because they have the CNC woodworking equipment and in a perfect world they should be able to do the job cheaper than I can DIY it. But this world falls well short of perfect, so what I expect is a quote that's still way outside my budget. Anyone want to speculate? I would be surprised if it doesn't hit five figures. Possibly well into the fives.

Anyway, in the process of putting this design together I learned a bit about cabinetry. Just enough to be dangerous. Or enough to think I *could* DIY this and hope for a credible result. Of course that means setting up a 3D router, which I was planning to do anyway. And FreeCAD does know a thing or two about 3D routing, doesn't it?

Please stay turned for the next episode of this wild and wacky ride.",2,1750922417.0,FreeCAD,0,1.0,False

Brynn Everett sat in front of the vanity, her crisp white wedding dress glowing under the lights. This was supposed to be the best day of her life, but you wouldn't know it from the blank look on her face—no hint of a smile anywhere.

The ceremony was about to kick off, but the groom? Total no-show.

""Ding!"" Her phone pinged, breaking the quiet.

Brynn peeked at the screen. It was a video from Kylie Blaze.

She frowned, pausing for a second before hitting play.

The video popped open on a hospital room. Kylie's face wasn't in the shot, but the camera zeroed in on a guy sitting by a bed, peeling an apple real slow and careful.

""Chase, I'm so sorry,"" Kylie's voice came through, soft and guilty. ""I didn't mean to get sick out of the blue and mess everything up for you... ""

Chase glanced up with a goofy, warm grin. ""Come on, don't be silly. You're the one I'm worried about.""

""But what about your wedding with Brynn?"" Kylie asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Chase stopped peeling for a sec and shrugged like it was nothing. ""Eh, no big deal. I wasn't into marrying her anyway.""

The video ended there, but Brynn's stomach was doing flips.

That guy? That was Chase Johnson—her fiancé, the one still missing from their big day.

Kylie sent this on purpose. Brynn could feel it deep down.

She swallowed hard and called her parents, who hadn't shown up either.

The line picked up quick, but the voices weren't the warm, loving ones she remembered.

""Brynn, sweetie,"" her dad, Randy Everett, said, sounding short and to the point. ""You can't make love happen. Chase is crazy about Kylie. Let it go, alright?"" Her mom, Maris Everett, didn't even chime in—just dead air that said plenty.

Brynn's breath hitched. She couldn't wrap her head around this.

The wedding was already rolling. Guests were hanging out outside, and now they wanted her to just walk away.

""Dad, Mom, you—"" she started, her voice shaky.

""That's it,"" Randy cut her off. ""Ceremony hasn't started. You can still cancel.""

And then, ""Click""—he was gone.

Brynn stared at her phone, feeling numb.

Ever since she found out she and Kylie got switched at birth, her parents had been acting cold.

She'd held onto a tiny hope—years of family moments had to mean something.

She believed that, even if she wasn't their real kid, there'd be some connection.

Now they turned to be nothing but.

""Miss Everett, we're starting soon. The groom—"" The officiant popped his head in, stopping short when he saw her face.

Brynn turned to him, took a big breath, and straightened up. ""Wedding's still happening."" She wiped her eyes, grabbed her dress, and headed out.

The officiant's mouth hung open as she brushed past him into the hall.

Guests spun around, caught off guard, as the bride stormed in alone, whispers spreading fast.

Brynn marched right to the stage and grabbed the mic.

The room went quiet for a second.

""Hey, thanks for showing up today, everybody,"" she said, keeping her voice steady even though her heart was a mess. ""Bad news—the groom couldn't make it. Something—or someone—came up, I guess.""

A buzz of shocked chatter swept through the crowd.

Brynn looked out at them, forcing a small, tight smile. ""So, here's the plan: anyone who wants to step up and marry me right now can take the groom's spot.""

Wild? Yeah. But she didn't care anymore.

The Everetts and Chase didn't give a crap about her—why should she waste another minute on them?

But after Brynn dropped that wild offer, nobody budged. Not one guest stepped up.

Everyone knew the Everett-Johnson drama was a total trainwreck. No one'd be crazy enough to jump into that mess.

It was asking for trouble, plain and simple.

Brynn wasn't ready for this—dead quiet stretching out forever. She stood there on the stage, all eyes glued to her like she was the butt of some twisted joke.

Her grip tightened on the mic, knuckles turning white.

She bit her lip, starting to second-guess herself, about to say something to cut through the awkwardness—

Then the hall doors flew open.

A good-looking guy walked in, and Brynn's eyes locked onto his—dark, mysterious ones that threw her off balance.

""I'll marry you,"" he said, cool and steady.

\*\*\*\*\*

Meanwhile, Portmare International Airport was like a ghost town.

The huge terminal was empty except for a line of black-suited bodyguards standing stiff at security, looking antsy.

In the VIP lounge, a few sharp-dressed guys were pacing around, waiting.

If any of Portmare's big names saw this, they'd be shocked—these weren't just random hotshots; they were the kind of people who could make the whole city move with a nod. But right now, they were stuck, stressing over one person showing up.

A guy with glasses in a neat suit burst in, out of breath. ""Sir, the president's gone.""

The guy was mayor of Portmare. His face scrunched up. ""Gone? What's that supposed to mean?""

""His jet didn't land here,"" the assistant blurted. ""It hit a private airstrip instead. And... he went straight to the Everett family.""

""The Everett family?"" The mayor blinked, confused.

The guys in the room swapped looks, totally lost. Obviously, they didn't even know who the Everetts were.

It wasn't their fault. The Everetts had some sway in Portmare, sure, but they weren't exactly hanging with the top dogs.

""Find out more about the Everetts,"" the mayor said, his voice sharp. ""Do it now.""

# 2.Chapter 2 The Wildest Wedding Ever

That ""I'll marry you"" landed like a bomb, and the room went silent.

Jaws hit the floor, heads turned—everyone stared at the guy who'd just walked in and flipped everything upside down.

He had a killer jawline, and when he looked at Brynn, his eyes lit up with something big, like a sky full of stars.

She froze, caught off guard, staring a little too hard.

The guests, though? They lost it, whispering like crazy.

""Who's this guy?"" someone mumbled.

""No idea... maybe from Chase's crew?"" another shot back.

""Bet he's got beef with Chase. Why else would he jump in?"" The chatter spread fast.

""This is hands-down the wildest wedding I've ever been to,"" someone laughed.

Brynn shook herself out of it. She didn't know this dude at all, but if he was game...

""Hey,"" she said, looking right at him, keeping it steady. ""You for real?""

He met her eyes, calm but with a spark. ""I don't play games.""

""Name's Dominic Johnson,"" he tossed out with a little smirk. ""And I don't mess around.""

Dominic. Cool name.' Brynn thought to herself. 'Hold up—both Johnsons?'

""You related to Chase?"" Brynn asked, squinting at him.

Dominic checked her out for a second, then said slow, ""Kind of.""

""Kind of?"" She raised an eyebrow.

Brynn looked at this guy—he seemed a bit older than Chase. So if she married him, she may end up his aunt or whatever. That almost made her crack up.

Brynn's heart was pounding like crazy as she hiked up her skirt and stepped off the stage.

""Well, congrats,"" she said, keeping her voice steady even though she felt like a mess inside. ""Starting today, you're my husband—Brynn Everett's husband.""

Dominic tilted his head a little, his eyes locking onto hers. Then he reached out and took her hand in his.

""I'm a lucky guy,"" he said, his voice low and smooth.

His hand was warm and firm—like something solid to hold onto when she didn't even realize she needed it.

Brynn blinked, thrown off for a second. This guy... he didn't seem half bad. She seemed to have tripped into something good.

No time to dwell on it. She straightened up and turned back to the crowd. ""Since I'm hitched now, let's get one thing straight: as of today, I'm done with the Everett family. No connection, no nothing.""

The room blew up with gasps and whispers.

""Is she out of her mind?"" a man yelled.

Okay, she wasn't their real kid, but they'd raised her for years.

Ditching the Everetts was like throwing away every bit of clout she had—going from somebody to nobody in a snap.

Anyone with half a brain would be kissing up to the family right now, not setting the whole bridge on fire.

Brynn could hear the chatter swirling around her. Her hands were sweaty, nerves starting to creep in.

She'd always been the good girl—doing what she was told, keeping everyone happy. If she could've, she'd have stayed that way forever.

But then Kylie showed up, and it all went to hell.

The parents who'd adored her turned icy. The guy who'd said he loved her pulled away.

And now, for Kylie's sake, they couldn't even bother showing up to her wedding.

Sure, Kylie had it rough growing up. Brynn got that, but she didn't deserve this.

After the switched-at-birth mess came out, she'd handed over everything good to Kylie without a fight.

And how'd Kylie thank her? By playing the poor little victim, making Brynn look like the bad guy every chance she got.

Kylie's moves were so obvious a kid could spot them, but her parents? They ate up every tearful act like they'd lost their senses.

They'd even called Brynn petty and jealous, like she was the one trying to push Kylie out.

She'd never even considered it.

This wedding—she'd been planning it for months, dreaming about it. Now it was a joke.

She was exhausted—worn out down to her bones. She was sick of them letting her down again and again. Sick of the Everetts, full stop.

""Having second thoughts?"" A deep, smooth voice hit her ear, snapping her out of it with a shiver.

Brynn jumped, her ears going hot as she spun around—and accidentally brushed Dominic's cheek with her lips.

Her face turned red, heat crawling up her neck. She didn't know when she had gotten so close.

Dominic didn't flinch, though—just stayed cool as ever.

""No second thought,"" she said, clearing her throat. Before anyone could react, she grabbed his hand and hauled him back to the stage.

With everyone staring, she pulled out the bride and groom rings. No waiting for the officiant—she slid hers on, then took Dominic's hand and put his on too.

""Wedding's over,"" she said loud and clear. ""Enjoy the food, everybody.""

She didn't even glance at the shocked crowd—just yanked Dominic toward the door.

His mouth twitched, a little smirk sneaking out as he let her drag him along.

Just as Brynn and Dominic were heading out, Chase's parents finally showed up, strolling in like they owned the place—late, of course.

At first, they'd been cool with Brynn—thrilled, even. She'd seemed like the perfect daughter-in-law.

But once it came out she wasn't the Everett's real kid? Boom—she went from a winning lottery ticket to a total bust in their eyes.

They'd been counting on a big score and ended up with zero.

Yup, at least they had a justified reason to be mad.

The engagement was set way back when. Ditching it now would make the Johnsons look like stuck-up jerks, and they weren't about to let that happen.

So they cooked up a little plan: roll in late to the wedding, let Brynn sweat it out a bit.

It was a slick way to put her in her place—remind her she wasn't the catch she thought she was. No point in letting some nobody get too big-headed.

But when they walked in, all they saw was Brynn dragging some guy out the door.

""What the... "" Chase's dad, Patrick, squinted hard and rubbed his eyes. ""That guy she's with—doesn't he look like the president? Isn't he in Eaglemont City now?""

""You're losing it,"" Eleanor shot back, rolling her eyes. ""We sent an invite over there, and their butler wouldn't even give us a 'hello.' You think he'd just show up?""

She crossed her arms, steaming. ""But this Brynn girl—pulling another guy out in front of everybody? She's basically plastering a giant 'cheater' label on our son's face.""

Eleanor wasn't dumb—she knew Chase had ditched the wedding. No big deal.

He'd still been ready to marry Brynn, fake heiress or not. She should've been thanking her lucky stars for that.

Instead, she's strutting out with some random guy like she doesn't care who's watching.

""Has she no shame?"" Eleanor murmured.

# 3.Chapter 3 Officially Married

As soon as they stepped outside the venue, a chilly wind smacked Brynn in the face, jolting her out of her headspace.

""Brynn."" Dominic's voice broke through her jumbled thoughts.

She glanced up at him, and before she could react, he was holding out a card.

""What's this... ?"" she asked, squinting at it.

""I've got something to handle soon, so I can't stick around to help you get settled,"" Dominic said, looking right at her.

He paused, then added, ""My place doesn't have much for a woman. You'd be starting from zero if you moved in.""

Brynn's brain hit a snag. ""Your place? Get me settled?"" she repeated, totally thrown.

She hadn't seen that coming—he was legit asking her to move in.

Sure, she'd gone full-on dramatic at the wedding, all fired up and serious, but this guy? She'd known him for maybe an hour.

""Isn't this a little quick?"" she said, giving him a skeptical look. ""We just got married, like, five minutes ago... ""

Dominic caught the doubt flashing across her face and raised an eyebrow. ""So you're not planning to live with me?""

His mouth twitched, almost smirking. ""What, was all that back there just you letting off steam?""

""No chance,"" she fired back fast, meeting his gaze head-on. ""I meant every single word. I'm not chickening out—I stand by it.""

""There you go."" Dominic let out a low, laid-back laugh and took her hand. ""Come on, let's head home.""

His car was parked just a few feet away—nothing fancy, just a regular, no-frills ride.

Brynn gave it a quick once-over, figuring her new discount husband probably wasn't swimming in money.

She peeked at the card in her hand and mumbled to herself, ""Handing over his bank card like that... what if I just ran off with it? He's too trusting.""

But even as she grumbled, a weird warm feeling snuck up on her.

They'd just met, their marriage was barely official—no papers or anything—and here he was, handing her his card like it was no big deal.

Before they hopped in, she stopped short and shoved it back at him.

""I've got my own cash to handle things,"" she said, keeping her voice steady. ""You keep this.""

She'd saved up a solid stash over the years—winnings from contests, some lucky stock moves.

She could cover herself no problem. No need to raid his pockets.

Dominic glanced at the card but didn't grab it. ""This is what husbands do—take care of their wives.""

He tossed in casually, ""No PIN. Use it whenever you want.""

Brynn groaned inside. This guy was stubborn as a mule. She was trying to be cool about it, yet he just couldn't get it.

She wasn't cheap—setting up a place would cost a pretty penny.

And this guy? Yup, he's handsome, but with his basic car and plain clothes, he probably wasn't loaded. He didn't need to act like a big shot for her.

Brynn was just trying to do him a favor.

""We haven't even signed anything,"" she said, softening her tone a bit. ""It doesn't feel right taking your money.""

Dominic opened the passenger door and nodded for her to get in.

She gave him a look, then slid into the seat.

He got in on his side, buckling up as he talked, all calm and straightforward. ""You said it yourself—no regret, no second thought.

""We had the ceremony. No papers yet, yeah, but we're married. Me giving you money to get settled? That's just how it goes. Don't overthink it.""

Brynn was about to argue, but Dominic cut her off. ""Or... how about we grab the license first?"" he said, his tone light and playful.

He shot her a look, that half-smirk of his showing off a glint of mischief in his eyes.

Brynn's cheeks went hot—half embarrassed, half annoyed—and she looked away quick.

""I didn't say that,"" she grumbled. ""Alright, fine—if you're so set on me taking it, I will.""

She grabbed the card and shoved it into her pocket with a sharp little move.

This guy,' she thought. 'Whatever. I'm just not going to use it.'

Dominic's mouth quirked into a small smile as he watched her give in. Without a word, he turned the key and started the car.

""Uh, I need to stop by the Everetts' place first,"" Brynn said, staring out the window.

Dominic's hands stilled on the steering wheel. ""The Everetts... ?""

""All my stuff's there—IDs, papers, all of it,"" she said, a hint of irritation creeping in. ""How am I supposed to officially marry you without them? Or are you fine just playing house forever with no paperwork?""

""Nah, I'll take you there now,"" Dominic said, dropping the teasing vibe. He gave a quick nod and turned the car toward the Everett family's place.

The idea of seeing her parents again shut Brynn up.

Dominic didn't pry, just let her space out, watching the scenery zip by outside.

Soon enough, they rolled up to the Everett villa.

Brynn blinked back to the moment, took a deep breath, and reached for the door.

""Want me to come in?"" Dominic asked, his voice calm and even.

She stopped, then turned to look at him. A tiny smile tugged at her lips. ""Nah, I can handle it.""

He just nodded, keeping it simple.

Brynn stepped out, and Dominic started to pull away. She caught a glimpse of him through the window and paused.

""Hey,"" she called.

He glanced back, eyebrows up like he was waiting for her to say something.

""Drive safe, alright? Take it easy,"" she said, tripping over her words a bit.

They were married now, kinda—checking on him felt like the natural thing to do, or so she figured.

""Yeah, I will,"" Dominic said, letting out a quiet laugh as he shot her a grin. Then he drove off, leaving the villa in the dust.

Brynn watched the car fade away, a weird warm feeling settling in her chest.

It was... nice, almost. Like they'd been married forever.

She shook her head. ""No, hang on—we are married. Just need the papers to back it up,"" she mumbled to herself.

She slapped her cheeks to shake off the daze, letting the weird thoughts go away.

Toughening up, she strode up to the villa and pushed the door open.

Before she could even step inside, laughter hit her ears.

""Chase, you're so clever! I've been stuck on this riddle forever,"" Kylie said, her voice all perky and bright.

""You're just not used to these games. I'll show you some tricks next time,"" Chase said, chuckling back.

In the living room, Kylie was cozied up next to Chase on the couch, both of them hunched over a tablet.

Across from them, Maris sipped her tea with a smug little smirk on her face.

# 4.Chapter 4 Face Slapping

Maris was sipping her tea when a shadow by the door caught her eye. She turned and bam—locked eyes with Brynn.

Her face went stiff, a quick flash of panic in her eyes.

""B-Brynn!"" It came out like a squeak, totally caught off guard.

The noise made the two tangled up on the couch jump apart like they'd been zapped.

Brynn knew nobody really gave a crap about her feelings—she'd figured that out years ago—but this? Seeing it still hit her hard, like a punch to the chest she couldn't shake off.

Maris caught Brynn's look and shrank a little, feeling guilty.

Sure, Brynn wasn't her real kid, but after all this time living together, you don't just share a house with someone that long and feel zilch. Blood or not, they got attached.

Still, every time she thought about her actual daughter—the one swapped at birth, the one who'd had it rough while Brynn got the easy life—resentment bubbled up, cold and sharp.

Love and hate duked it out in her head, leaving her tongue-tied and clueless about what to say to Brynn.

Especially now. Because there was Chase, Brynn's fiancé, all cozy with Maris's real daughter, caught in the act.

Chase squirmed, rubbing the back of his neck as he glanced at Brynn. It slammed into him—today was their wedding day.

Before Maris or Chase could sputter out some lame excuse, a super sweet voice cut through the room.

""Brynn!"" Kylie popped up from the couch, her face all innocent with a little pout as she shuffled toward Brynn.

""Oh, don't get it twisted! Chase and me—it's not what you think, promise!"" Her words spilled out fast.

Brynn just stared at her, blank-faced.

She was so done with Kylie's fake-nice routine—her ears were practically numb to it by now.

Same old crap, over and over.

""Hang on... "" Kylie tilted her head, eyes going wide like she'd just noticed something. ""Brynn, why's your dress so... extra today?""

She blinked at Brynn's getup, playing dumb like a pro.

Brynn's lip twitched. She almost bit her tongue, then said, ""It's a wedding dress.""

Kylie had to be the champ of acting clueless—like she'd never seen a bride before.

""Oh! A wedding dress!"" Kylie slapped a hand over her mouth, gasping. Then, like she'd just had a lightbulb moment, she went, ""Duh, right! It's your big day, isn't it? So... why're you here, sis?""

Brynn stared, too stunned to speak. She was dying to smack that smug look off her face.

""Oh!"" Kylie yelped again, glancing between Brynn and Chase like she'd just solved a mystery. ""Wait, I totally forgot—Chase is the groom, right? But he's been chilling with me... ""

And there it was—Kylie flipping the whole thing around, digging the knife in with a grin.

The worst part? Neither her mom nor her fiancé clocked it. They just sat there, quiet as rocks.

Brynn let out a sharp, bitter laugh. ""Kylie, cut the act. You've trashed my wedding day—pretty happy with yourself, huh?""

If she hadn't caught that video Kylie sent—then pulled back real quick—Brynn would've whipped out her phone and shoved it in her face right then.

""What? I'm not acting!"" Kylie's lip wobbled, her eyes tearing up like she was about to lose it.

She went on, ""You know how tough it's been for me growing up—always sick, always struggling. I passed out earlier, and Chase was just being sweet, taking me to the hospital. I didn't mean for any of this... ""

Her voice broke, and she sniffled, dropping her head as the tears rolled.

Chase stood there, a few feet off, totally losing it over Kylie's tears.

His heart went soft, and without even tossing Brynn a word, he bolted over and pulled Kylie into a hug.

""Shh, it's alright,"" he mumbled, rubbing her back.

Then he spun around, shooting Brynn a death stare. ""Brynn, knock it off. You know Kylie's not doing great—she passed out earlier, and I had to take care of her. Why're you being such a jerk about it?""

Kylie sniffled into his chest, her voice all weak. ""Chase, don't argue with her because of me. I'll be okay... ""

That just made Chase scowl harder, his eyes sparking as he glared at Brynn. ""See? Kylie's got a heart of gold—sick as she is, and she's still defending you. And you? Some big sister you are.""

Brynn stared back, jaw locked, one eyebrow twitching like she was watching a total freak show.

'How did I miss what a complete idiot this guy is?' she thought, shaking her head to herself.

""Yeah, Brynn,"" Maris piped up from the side, unable to keep quiet. ""Kylie's in rough shape—can't you just chill out for once?""

Maris had been battling her own guilt, but seeing her real daughter—so shaky, so teary—hit her hard.

All those years Kylie struggled while Brynn had it easy? It flipped something in her.

To Maris, Brynn owed her sister some slack—it was only right. Time to even the score.

Brynn let out a short, dry laugh. ""Oh, I see how it is,"" she said, her voice cold as ice.

Fed up—totally over it—with both Maris and Chase, she turned and stomped over to the living room TV stand.

She yanked the bottom drawer open and grabbed a fat manila envelope.

Inside? Kylie's medical records, from way back to now. Solid proof she'd tracked down after Kylie tried to screw her over one too many times.

Brynn had sent someone to dig, and boom—there it was, the real deal.

She smirked, gripping the envelope. Weak as a kitten, huh? This woman's tougher than a tank—every test screaming she's in top shape.

""Here,"" Brynn said, voice flat as she dumped the papers onto the coffee table.

They hit with a thump, scattering everywhere.

She scoffed, ""Check it out yourselves. Let's see if Kylie's really the fragile little thing she says she is.""

Kylie, still tucked against Chase, froze up. Her face went pale.

She never knew Brynn had checked on her. Panic flashed as she chewed her lip.

Maris and Chase blinked at the pile, thrown off.

Maris snatched a sheet, flipping through, her face getting stormier by the second.

Chase leaned over her shoulder, eyes popping like he'd seen a ghost.

The reports didn't mess around—Kylie was healthy as heck. No anemia, no blood sugar crashes, no nothing. She was fitter than anyone there.

Kylie's face went white as a sheet. ""Chase, Mom, I—"" she stuttered, voice shaky.

""Slap."" Maris chucked the papers back on the table, the sound loud enough to make Kylie jump.

She locked eyes with her daughter, all steel and stone.

""Kylie,"" she said, slow and sharp, ""tell me straight. Are these legit? Have you been lying this whole time? Faking it?""

# 5.Chapter 5 Becoming Mrs. Johnson

Sweat popped up on Kylie's forehead, and she wiped her shaky hands on her jeans, totally freaking out inside.

She couldn't fess up to faking it—not now. Everything she'd worked for would fall apart, and she hadn't played this game so long just to lose it all.

""N-no, no way!"" she burst out, shaking her head hard. ""Mom, why would I lie to you? I've been sick since I was little—you know that!""

Maris scrunched her face, glancing at the papers. ""Then what's up with these... ?""

""I don't know!"" Kylie's tears kicked in fast, like she'd hit a button. ""Maybe it's some weird condition they can't figure out. Mom, I'm your real daughter—don't you believe me?""

Seeing Kylie bawling again, Maris softened up quick. She stepped over and pulled her into a big hug.

""Shh, don't cry,"" she said, all gentle. ""Of course I believe you, honey. We'll sort it out—I'll make sure you're okay, I swear.""

Kylie was her little girl, after all—the one who'd had it rough for years. Doubting her felt wrong. Maris held onto that, her heart going mushy.

Kylie, smelling victory, didn't skip a beat. She peeked up through teary eyes, turning on the waterworks for Brynn.

""Brynn,"" she whined, voice cracking, ""why do you have all my medical stuff? Did you snoop into my life? Were you trying to ditch me? I'm sorry, okay? Please don't toss me out... ""

Maris's head whipped toward Brynn, eyes narrowing.

Why would Brynn dig around like that? —It didn't sit right, and the more she chewed on it, the more it ticked her off.

""Brynn,"" Maris said, her voice sharp with suspicion, ""is she right? Are you really trying to shove Kylie out of the family? How could you?""

Her tone turned cold, like she'd already decided. Trust in Brynn? Out the window.

Brynn watched her once-cozy mom turn icy and let out a small, bitter laugh. No warmth—just an empty noise.

Twenty years as a daughter, wiped out by one blood connection. It hurt, sharp and deep.

""Mom, you don't need to stress about me kicking Kylie out,"" Brynn said, her voice cool and solid.

She locked eyes with Maris, too worn out to even get mad—just calm, done.

She announced, coldly, ""I'm married now. As of today, I'm leaving the Everett house. From here on, I'm finished with this family.""

Chase blinked at her, clueless. ""Wait, leaving? To my place? Uh, that's not really—""

""Don't kid yourself,"" Brynn snapped, giving him a look that could stop a wildfire. ""I'm going to my husband's place. You're not part of this.""

Chase's mouth fell open. ""I'm your fiancé! I didn't even make it to the wedding—who's this husband?""

Brynn smirked, arms crossed. ""Oh, Chase, get a grip. I'm a catch—good-looking, talented, the full deal. Half the guys in Oceanfront would've jumped to marry me. You didn't want me? Whatever. Someone else did.""

And that was it—she was done talking. She turned, headed upstairs to her room, grabbed her ID and some papers, then came back down, ready to walk out for good.

""Brynn, can you stop messing around?"" Chase snapped, his forehead creasing with irritation.

He was sure she was just venting—no way she meant it.

He knew her too well: outside of him, there wasn't a decent guy in her life.

'Marry someone else? Please,' he thought, shaking his head.

He was sure she was just trying to rile him up, and he wasn't about to play along and run after her like some chump.

""Believe it or don't, I don't care."" Brynn was over dealing with him—total waste of breath.

She threw him a killer eye roll and walked out of the Everett house without a second thought.

Chase still figured it was a fit. He was halfway through deciding whether to follow when his phone went off.

With a grunt, he pulled it out, saw it was his mom, and slouched against the wall.

""Mom, what's up?"" he mumbled, half-checked out.

""Chase, you're done with that little skank Brynn, you hear me?"" Eleanor's voice blasted through, loud and pissed.

He winced. ""Mom, relax, Brynn and I—""

""She ran off with some guy at the wedding!"" Eleanor steamrolled over him. ""Made us look like a bunch of clowns!""

""What?!"" Chase's voice jumped, cracking.

His eyes popped wide, and his phone almost hit the floor. 'Brynn actually married someone else?' He stood there, stuck, brain frying.

Meanwhile, Brynn marched out of the Everett house, done with the whole circus.

But bad news travels fast. She'd barely stepped past the gate when the gossip kicked up behind her.

""That's Brynn, the Everett girl, right?"" someone whispered, not quiet enough. ""Heard her fiancé bailed on her.""

""Yeah, dude didn't even show,"" another piped up. ""She got so mad she just picked some guy at the wedding and was like, 'Let's get hitched!'""

""No freaking way. That's nuts,"" the first one said, floored.

""She's even saying she's cutting off the Everetts—no more family, done,"" someone else added, shaking their head.

""Sounds like she's lost it. Who even says that?"" a voice sighed.

Brynn froze mid-step.

These loudmouths weren't exactly discreet—she caught every word, clear as day, even their shocked little tones.

Yeah, she'd decided to cut ties and move on, but hearing this crap? It still sucked.

Her jaw clenched, fists balled up. She hadn't screwed up anything, but everyone was pointing fingers at her.

It stung bad, and her eyes started to burn. She dipped her head, trying to keep it together.

Right then, a car pulled up next to her, headlights flashing. The tires squealed against the road, snapping her out of it.

She jerked her head up, staring at the slick sedan.

The window rolled down, and there was Dominic—sharp jawline, cool as ever, catching her eye with a small, laid-back grin.

""Mrs. Johnson,"" he said, voice smooth and steady, ""Need a ride?""

# 6.Chapter 6 The President Is Married

Brynn gawked at Dominic behind the wheel, her jaw practically on the floor.

""You? Here?"" she blurted, frozen in place.

He didn't say anything. He Just stretched a long arm over, popped the passenger door open, and gave her a nod.

""Hop in,"" he said, cool and calm.

Brynn glanced around—yeah, standing on the curb wasn't the vibe for this chat. She slid in, shut the door, and waited till the engine purred before pushing again.

""Didn't you say you had stuff going on?"" She shot him a look, eyebrow up.

Dominic flicked his gaze her way, then back to the road. ""Yeah, I did. But then I figured there's something bigger I haven't dealt with.""

""Like what?"" Brynn scrunched her face, totally lost.

""Making it official."" He swung the car around a corner, tossing it out like it was no big deal—like he was asking for the remote.

Brynn went stiff, brain spinning.

Official? Her mind kicked into overdrive—he was moving fast, like he thought she'd bail if he didn't seal the deal quick.

She snuck a glance at him. Sharp jaw, way hotter than Chase's lame self.

She gave a tiny mental shrug. Guy like him? Probably had chicks lined up around the block.

'So why the hurry with me?' A weird little thought slipped in, and she couldn't shake it.

""Mr. Johnson... "" She paused, then went for it, voice careful. ""You don't, uh... have some kind of issue, do you?""

""SCREECH."" The tires screamed against the road.

Dominic slammed the brakes, the car jolting hard enough to rattle her teeth.

Brynn pitched forward, the seatbelt yanking her back before she face-planted the dash.

She gripped the seat, staring at him, eyes huge. 'Oh crap, did I guess right? That reaction was wild.'

""I'm good,"" he said, half-laughing, half-annoyed, turning to her. ""Didn't see that coming from you.""

He shook his head, still chuckling—lucky he hadn't punched the gas instead.

The car was stopped dead in the street, so he eased it over to the curb, then leaned her way.

Brynn flinched, shrinking back into the corner as he got closer, boxing her in against the seat with no escape.

""What—what're you doing?"" she stuttered, eyeballing the guy now way too close. Her heart was pounding, voice wobbly.

She was worried he was mad because her words had poked his sore spot.

""Questioning me?"" Dominic raised an eyebrow, smirking. ""Guess you'll see tonight, young lady—find out if I can handle it... Or if YOU can handle it.""

His breath hit her ear as he talked, and a blush shot up from her neck to her cheeks.

She tugged at her collar, flustered, fingers gripping it like he might try something right there in the front seat.

Seeing her freak out, Dominic's grin got bigger. Happy with that, he pulled back, settling into his spot.

""Chill, I'm not that hard up to prove myself,"" he teased, starting the car again. ""Real talk, it's not just me pushing this. My family's been on my case to settle down.""

The car rolled back into traffic, and he kept going. ""But there's more—my daughter needs a mom, like, yesterday.""

Brynn's head snapped around so fast she almost snapped her neck.

Her jaw dropped, eyes bugging out.

""You've got a daughter?"" she asked, voice shooting up in shock.

Dominic gave a chill nod. ""Yeah. So if you're rethinking this, now's your shot to back out.""

Brynn went quiet, staring at her hands, her mind spinning.

She hadn't bargained on stepping into mom duties right after jumping into this crazy marriage.

Her forehead wrinkled. But then she flashed back to the past hour—Chase, her mom, the whole Everett disaster—and bit her lip. Her gaze turned sharp.

""Nah, I'm good,"" she said, voice hard and sure. ""Let's do this—County Clerk's Office, right now.""

She'd already made up her mind to torch every tie to the Everetts and Chase.

No second-guessing now. Her fists balled up tight.

Dominic's mouth quirked into a small smirk.

""Cool,"" he said, hitting the gas toward the Clerk's Office.

Fifteen minutes later, Brynn stood at the entrance, blinking at the dead-empty lobby.

""I knew nobody's getting married these days, but damn—this is depressing,"" she mumbled, scoping the place out.

It was a total ghost town—just her and Dominic, not a single other person around.

She frowned, grumbling under her breath, ""Big fancy office, and it's quieter than a graveyard.""

What Brynn didn't catch? The whole building had been emptied out on purpose.

She stood there, oblivious, while the Clerk's Office director sat behind the counter, stealing looks at them.

His hands clamped the chair arms, practically buzzing with nerves and excitement.

He couldn't believe his luck—he was the first guy in Oceanfront to see the President up close. Not even the mayor could flex that.

He puffed out his chest a little, feeling smug as hell.

As Dominic and Brynn walked up, the director took a couple deep breaths, smoothing his face into something official.

He needed to look sharp for the President, he told himself. He snuck a glance at Brynn. Oh, and the First Lady.

First guy in Oceanfront to get a good look at her? Yup.

And now he was about to handle the marriage license for President Johnson and the First Lady himself.

His ego ballooned. Nail this, and he'd be golden—career skyrocketing.

A grin crept onto his face, and by the time they got to him, he was full-on beaming, showing off a cheesy row of teeth.

Brynn clocked him—a middle-aged guy, dressed like he slept in a suit—and shook her head.

'Yikes. Marriage is so dead even the paper-pushers are stuck doing the dirty work,' she thought, swallowing a laugh.

""He's smiling like he just won a prize. Guess we're the only idiots signing up today."" She slid Dominic a look, muttering, ""Super romantic.""

The paperwork was quick. The director flew through it, handing over the forms like he was putting on a show. All that was left was the license photo.

Dying to stretch out his big moment with President Johnson, he grabbed a camera and jumped up.

Brynn let out a sigh, shaking her head. This just proved how empty the Clerk's Office was—hardly any staff, just one dude handling everything.

She and Dominic just stood there, sitting stiff as statues. There was enough space between them to fit a whole extra person, and neither of them looked eager to budge. The awkwardness was off the charts.

The director, messing with the camera, clocked the tension and smirked to himself. 'First Lady's shy, huh?' He laughed inside. 'Time to play hero.'

""Ma'am,"" he said, all smooth and sugary, ""slide a little closer to your husband.""

Brynn gave a quick nod and moved toward Dominic, shifting around like she couldn't get comfy.

""A bit more,"" the director nudged, still beaming like he was everybody's favorite uncle.

She moved over again, barely settled, when Dominic's arm swooped in. With one quick tug, he pulled her straight onto his arms, their bodies mashed together.

""Wait—"" Brynn squeaked, eyes going huge as she gaped at him.

""He said closer,"" Dominic said, flat as ever.

Brynn bit back a comeback, swinging her head toward the camera. Her cheeks lit up red.

""You guys could cozy up a bit more,"" the director piped up, still grinning like a dope. ""Maybe look at each other, toss an arm around—something cute.""

Brynn winced—ugh, cheesy—but went for the lesser evil, turning to face Dominic.

Bad move. He spun toward her at the exact same time, and their eyes locked.

She tipped her head up, he leaned down, and—bam—their lips smashed together, total fluke.",1,1750922378.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Moving day can be chaotic, and I've seen countless families scrambling for basic items they packed away too early. Here's a practical checklist of essentials to keep with you (not in the moving truck) on moving day:

**First Day/Night Essentials:**

* Phone chargers and power banks
* Medications and first aid kit
* Change of clothes for each family member
* Basic toiletries and toilet paper
* Snacks and water bottles
* Important documents (lease, ID, insurance papers)
* Basic tools (screwdriver, hammer, scissors)
* Cleaning supplies for quick touch-ups
* Cash for tips and unexpected expenses
* Coffee/tea supplies (trust me on this one!)

**Pro tip:** Pack these in a clearly labeled ""FIRST DAY"" box or suitcase that travels with you, not in the moving truck.

# Subaru WRX STI | 2011-2014

* **Why it works**: Four proper doors mean both child seats latch in without Olympic-gymnast contortions. Symmetrical AWD laughs at school-run snow and still yanks to 60 mph in under five. The 2.5-litre boxer’s burble keeps you grinning even in traffic. Short-throw 6-speed lets you play rally hero between grocery stops. Huge trunk gulps strollers and scooters with room left for a Costco chicken. Easy bolt-on mods if you ever catch the boost-addiction bug. Looks subtle enough that the HOA won’t issue noise complaints—unless you uncork the exhaust, of course.
* **Watch-outs**: Ring-land failures if previous owners chased big boost without proper tuning; ask for compression numbers. Factory tunes run lean—an open-source map plus an oil-change schedule tighter than a drum is smart. Wheel bearings and suspension bushings wear early on pothole duty.
* **Uniqueness**: One of the last mad turbo sedans you could spec with a mechanical diffs trio and a giant hood scoop from the factory.

# VW Golf R (Mk6) | 2012-2013

* **Why it works**: Hatch body swallows push-chairs, science-fair volcanos, and the family dog all at once. 256 hp turbo-four + Haldex AWD = rain-dance grip and 0-60 in five-ish. Cabin ergonomics are peak-German—easy for your partner to hop in and drive without “what does this button do?” panic. Tight turning circle and compact size keep urban parking tedium to a minimum. Six-speed manual only in the US Mk6 means driver involvement is baked in. Tuners call the 2.0 T “big-power Lego”—a stage-1 flash nets \~300 hp for lunch-money costs. Meanwhile it still sips regular commuting fuel at 30 mpg highway if you behave.
* **Watch-outs**: Coil-pack gremlins and carbon build-up on direct-injection valves—look for service records. Haldex fluid needs changing every 20 k miles or the clutch pack sulks.
* **Uniqueness**: Sub-5,000-unit US allocation makes it far scarcer than any GTI, yet you can still sneak through traffic like a stealth fighter.

# Volvo V70R | 2004-2007

* **Why it works**: It’s a Swedish brick with a PhD in hooliganism—300 hp, AWD, and space for the entire IKEA run. Adaptive “Four-C” suspension flips from comfort cloud to Nürburgring-stiff with a steering-wheel button. The long roof means bikes, prams, and Golden Retrievers slide in without origami. Heated seats plus legendary Volvo crash safety keep the family committee happy. Turbo five-pot soundtrack is half war-drum, half coffee-grinder—utterly addictive. Manual gearbox examples exist and fit the budget if you hunt, adding unicorn sparkle. All-weather grip means winter tyre swaps become snow-day fun runs.
* **Watch-outs**: PCV system clogs, angle-gear failures, and pricey Brembo rotors—verify maintenance history. Electronic suspension struts can cost as much as a small nation’s GDP; check for leaks.
* **Uniqueness**: A sleeper wagon that’ll dust clueless sports cars while wearing a baby-on-board sticker—try finding another on the school drop-off line.",0,1750922287.0,whatcarshouldIbuy,0,0.5,False

I was pregnant with Havoc's child, but I saw him pecking another woman in the MC club. Sucking in a lungful of air, my eyes land on the woman beside him. I thought I knew what pain was. I’d consider myself an expert by now.......

# Book 1: Prologue

Prologue

Lola

I stare out the window at our small backyard and blink back tears. As I place the last dish on the drying rack, I grab the kitchen towel and wipe my eyes, quickly hiding my feelings with a fake smile.

I glance at my reflection in the windowpane and nod. Everyone will buy it—they always do. I’ve mastered the art of faking it, which shouldn’t be surprising. I’ve been doing it since I was eleven and caught my father with another woman.

My father’s threats of what he’d do to my mother if I ever told her bought my silence and fake smiles for years. He tried to smooth it over by showering me with expensive gifts, but that only made me feel dirty and even more like a traitor than I was by keeping quiet. But everywhere I went people gushed about how lucky and spoiled I was, especially my friends. I hated every second of it, but I bit my tongue until it bled and smiled until my cheeks ached.

It wasn’t until I turned sixteen that everything came crashing down.

A drunk driver killed my dad-–the drunk driver being my dad himself. His pregnant mistress died right next to him. When the cops showed up to tell us—not just about his death, but his affair—I realized my mom had known all along.

I don’t remember much else of what they said—my thoughts were tangled up in a mess.

After they left, I broached the subject while she made us tea.

“Of course I knew. A woman always knows. Plus, I hired a private detective to follow him around to collect evidence in case he ever tried to divorce me.”

I stare at her, my mouth hanging open in shock. “He blackmailed me. He told me he’d cut your brakes or⁠—”

“He knew there was an infidelity clause in the prenup,” she says, lifting her teacup to her lips to take a sip.

I feel sick to my stomach. “But if you knew what he did, then why’d you stay?”

What I don’t ask is why did she stay and make me live in this house with a man I hated.

“Do you think the other women in my circle aren’t dealing with the same thing? Don’t be ridiculous. It’s the price we wives pay for marrying rich. We lay by the pool and shop on 5th Avenue with smiles on our faces, wearing diamonds purchased with guilt money. As long as the mistress keeps her legs open, we wives keep our mouths shut to avoid gossip and scandal. In this world, reputation is everything. So what if my husband has a toy to play with? I’m the wife, that’s all that matters. Becoming vocal about where they put their dicks and making demands, is when they start flaunting their side piece in public, showing off the younger model in the country club like she’s an accessory. It’s pathetic. Everything we built would be reduced to tatters for other people’s amusements.”

“Dirty secrets don’t stay secret for long when they end up pregnant.” I snap.

“A baby is an easy fix.”

I don’t even try to hide my look of disgust from her.

“I guess that’s the difference between us. I’d rather be alone and happy than live a life where everything was fake, including the love you’re supposed to have for each other. The first time a man cheated on me would also be his last.”

The fact that she was never financially dependent on him, and in a position to leave at any time somehow makes it all worse.

“Ah, the naivety of youth. You don’t get it now, Lola, but you will one day. You’ll make choices that you never thought you’d have to, and the only thing that will get you through is your conviction to do so. You have to pick what you can and can’t live without. I can’t live without money and power, and I’m not ashamed to admit that. It’s what makes the world go round after all.

I take a deep breath and watch as she takes another sip of her tea, the smell of whisky and lemon permeating the air. Spiked tea at ten am? I don’t think she was unaffected, as she was trying to make out.

The phone ringing snaps me out of my walk down memory lane, which is probably for the best. I try not to think about my mother much these days.

It’s been years since I last saw her. She disowned me when I refused to give up Havoc—back when he was just Jonas, the first and only boy I ever loved.

When the phone stops ringing, I hear Havoc revving the bike he’s working on.

A few months ago, I would’ve sat on the deck steps just to watch him. I didn’t know a thing about bikes, so I couldn’t help, but being around him always calmed something inside me. I was grateful for that.

As much as Havoc loved the club, I didn’t. I always ended up a nervous wreck when we were summoned to the clubhouse.

I wanted to like it. Lord knows I’ve tried everything to fit in. I changed the way I dressed to look the part. And when a few comments were made, I even had my boobs done. I tried to be everything Havoc needed me to be. But in the process, I lost myself a little more each day.

And after finding out this morning I’m pregnant, I suddenly have this inexplicable urge to run. Every instinct I have is telling me to take my baby and leave. But how do I walk away from the man I’ve loved since the moment I was old enough to understand what love was?

I jump when the phone rings again. Cupping my still-flat stomach, I walk toward the noise, finding Havoc’s phone on the arm of the couch. I pick it up and my stomach drops when I see it’s Khan, the president of Havoc’s club. He’s never done anything to me, but he’s always rubbed me the wrong way.

I answer anyway, knowing Havoc’s neck will be on the line if I don’t. “Hello?”

“Put Havoc on the phone,” he grunts.

“He’s working on his dad’s bike. I’ll get⁠—”

“I don’t have all day, girl,” he barks at me.

I don’t say anything, I just head outside.

“Havoc,” I shout and wait as he turns around. He grins at me, and something inside me breaks a little more. I love him so damn much, yet he can’t see that I’m slowly fading away right in front of him.

“It’s Khan,” I tell him as he jogs over and plants a kiss on my lips before taking the phone from me.

I head back inside, knowing Khan wouldn’t want me overhearing anything. In his eyes, women are only good for fucking and feeding the brothers. He might not say that shit around Havoc, but I’ve heard him with some of the others—Driller, Havoc’s brother, being one of the worst.

If there’s anyone I disliked more than Khan, it’s him. Something about the way Driller looks at me makes my skin crawl. Thankfully, he and Havoc aren’t close. Havoc might bail him out of trouble whenever he gets himself into trouble—which is quite a lot,thanks to Driller’s inability to act like an adult—but at least I never have to worry about him sitting at my table and breaking bread with the man.

I head to the coffee machine and start a pot, but at the last minute, I swap out the regular coffee for decaf.

“I’ve gotta head to the clubhouse.”

I look over my shoulder when Havoc walks up behind me.

“I’m not sure when I’ll be back, so don’t bother cooking. I’ll pick something up on the way home or send a prospect over with something for you if I’m running late.”

His hands move to my hips before he yanks me to him and buries his face in my hair.

“That’s fine. I’ll probably just curl up on the sofa and watch something on TV.” I turn and look up at him. I need to tell him about the baby.

“Havoc…” My voice cracks.

“What’s wrong?”

But before I can say anything else, his phone chimes. I offer him one of my fake smiles, which makes me want to scream when he doesn’t call me on it, and shake my head.

I’ll tell him later, when he gets back. It’s also time I told him just how much I’m struggling.

“Nothing. It doesn't matter. Love you.”

“Love you too,” he says, kissing my forehead, making my eyes sting as I fight back tears. He grabs his cut from the back of the chair and pulls it on.

“I’ll text you and let you know what’s happening.”

“Okay, bye,” I whisper as I watch him walk away. He pauses, and in my head, I’m begging him to stay, to help me fix what is broken between us. But then his phone chimes, and he’s gone–the door slamming shut behind him.

I turn and grip the kitchen counter, dropping my head. I wonder when this house stopped feeling like home. It was probably around the same time Havoc started to feel less like mine and more like Khan’s. With a sigh, I run my hands through my hair and lift my head, deciding to soak in the tub for a while.

So I grab one of the books I picked up at the grocery store today and spend the next few hours losing myself in a world full of dragons.

It’s not until the water’s gone cold that I realize how late it’s gotten. I chuckle at how many hours I’ve lost reading, but I know there are worse habits. I climb out and towel off before slipping on one of Havoc’s T-shirts.

I pad over to the nightstand where I left my phone charging and frown when I see that Havoc hasn’t texted me.

It’s nine-thirty, so I’m guessing he forgot all about having food sent over for me. That’s okay. I haven’t had much of an appetite lately anyway.

I head downstairs and make myself a couple of slices of toast and another coffee as I never did drink the first one. I curl up on the sofa and turn on the crime channel, getting drawn into an episode of Cold Cases—one where the husband’s crying on screen.

“He did it,” I mumble to myself.

As I watch, my eyes get heavy, so I pull the throw from the back of the sofa and cover myself with it. before I settle back in and fall asleep. When I wake up, I have a crick in my neck, and sunlight is pouring in through the windows.

I fumble for my phone on the table and see it’s eight-thirty in the morning. I frown when I still don’t have any texts or missed calls from Havoc. A sick feeling makes my stomach clench as I get to my feet and head upstairs to the bedroom.

The bed is empty, my eyes confirming what my gut already knew—he didn’t come home.

The sick feeling intensifies. I know I’m not the ideal old lady, but I’m trying. He wouldn’t cheat on me... would he?

But then I think of the club girls—and all the brothers that do cheat—and cover my mouth as I run to the bathroom and throw up.

By the time I’m finished, my head’s pounding, and I know it’s only going to get worse. I push myself to my feet, a little unsteady, then wash my face and brush my teeth.

When a loud knock echoes through the house, I freeze before my brain kicks into gear. What if he didn’t stay at the clubhouse? What if he got hurt and he’s in the hospital… or worse?

I run to the door, not caring that I’m only wearing Havoc’s T-shirt. Yanking it open, I come face-to-face with Driller.

My stomach drops.

“Tell me he’s okay,” I plead.

He pushes me inside and closes the door behind him. “He’s in jail.”

“What? No, that can’t be.”

“Funny, because it is. And he ain’t getting out for a long time.”

“No.” I grip my hair, which is when I notice Driller checking out my bare legs. I take a step back. “I’ll go get dressed and head to the police station.”

“Don’t bother. He doesn’t want to see anyone—especially not you.”

I grit my teeth. “I don’t believe you.”

He shrugs and pulls out his phone. Tapping the screen, he places a call and puts it on speaker. “Khan? I’m with Lola. She doesn’t believe me about Havoc.”

Khan sighs. “It’s true. I needed a man inside, and he volunteered. He’s going to be in there for a while, too.”

“I don’t understand. He wouldn’t just leave without talking to me.”

“Look, Lola. I didn’t want to be the one to tell you this, but I can’t leave you hanging. He hooked up with Razzle last night. Guess he realized what he’d been missing and decided to kill two birds with one stone. Now, he can do the club a favor and split from you without the drama. I’m sorry it went down this way, but it is what it is.”

I stare at the phone, refusing to believe a damn word he’s saying. I know Havoc, despite my insecurities messing with my head earlier. He wouldn’t take the coward’s way out. He’s always faced everything head-on. If he wanted me gone, he would‘ve told me that himself.

“You gotta figure out your place here now, Lola. I know you don’t have anywhere to go, and the house you live in is Havoc’s.”

“What do you mean, my place?” I whisper, my mind going in a million directions. If I go down to the police station and beg them to let me see him, they have to, right?

“Women here fall into two categories: club girls and old ladies. You’re no longer an old lady, so that makes you fair game,” Khan reminds me.

“I’ll leave. I’m not becoming a club girl. No way.”

“Where are you going to go, huh? Who’s gonna take you in? Nobody. You’ve got nothing and no one who isn’t linked to the club. Havoc told us all about your rich, uppity family and how they disowned you when you chose Havoc over them. Do you think they’ll take you back now? I don’t think so. All they’ll see is trash.”

Tears run down my cheeks as his words slice through me like a knife.

“Might be one way to help, though. Driller? Are you up for it? Only way to keep her safe.”

“Yeah, Khan. Order me a cut.” He hangs up as I try to figure out what they’re talking about, but when Driller steps closer, I back up again.

“I’ll go to a shelter.”

“No, I don’t think you will, babe.” He keeps moving closer, and before I can run, he has me pinned against the wall. “The only thing you’ll do is warm my bed as my my old lady.”

I shake my head, but he grabs my jaw and holds me in place.

“What, my brother’s dick was good enough for you, but not mine?” he hisses, spittle hitting my cheek.

“I belong to Havoc. I’ll never be yours.”

He leans in and licks the tears from my cheek, making me shudder in disgust.

“Havoc’s gone. You belong to me now, bitch.”

He slips his hand under the hem of my T-shirt, and panic sets in—that's when I start pushing and shoving him, trying to get away.

“No. I can’t be yours, not when I’m carrying Havoc’s baby,” I yell, hoping that will make him leave me alone.

But when I see the look in his eyes, I know I’ve made a huge mistake.

“Well, that’s an easy problem to fix.” He grins before pulling back his arm and punching me in the stomach.

I scream in agony, covering my stomach as pain rips through me. He hits me again before tossing me to the floor.

I try to crawl away, but he kicks me in the ribs, knocking the wind out of me, and I collapse.

As I struggle to push myself up, he stomps on my lower back, making me scream again. Then, with a jerk, he flips me over and starts kicking me in the stomach over and over.

The pain is unbearable, but I keep fighting, desperately trying to protect my baby. But when I feel wetness running down my legs, I know I failed.

Still, he doesn’t stop. It isn’t until the darkness swallows me that it finally sinks in.

Havoc’s gone. My baby’s gone. And I’m all alone.

Alone with a monster.

# Chapter 1

Chapter 1



Amelia Carter had spent the entire day making sure everything was perfect.



The dinner reservation, the gift, the small speech she had rehearsed in her mind. She wanted tonight to be special. It was their Twentieth wedding anniversary, a milestone that symbolized love, endurance, and commitment.



She had given up her dreams, her ambitions, even her youth to build a home, raise their children, and support her husband’s career. Through financial struggles, sleepless nights with sick babies, and long years of playing the role of the perfect wife, she had endured it all. But she believed it was worth it. Because love meant sacrifice, didn’t it?



She checked the time again. 8:30 PM.



Richard was late.



Her fingers curled around the edge of the table, her stomach twisting with unease. She had texted him earlier, reminding him about their dinner plans. He had responded with a short, ""Busy. Will try to make it.""



She told herself he would come. He had to.



The restaurant was elegant and dimly lit, the soft glow of candles reflecting off the polished wine glasses. A waiter hovered nearby, casting her a sympathetic glance.



She smiled politely, hiding the growing discomfort crawling up her spine.



Then, just as she was about to reach for her phone again, she saw him.



Relief flooded through her, until she noticed he wasn’t alone.



Her breath caught in her throat as Richard walked toward her with a woman beside him.



Amelia’s world tilted.



The woman was young. Tall. A cascade of golden hair framed her delicate features. She wore a red dress, the kind that clung to every curve, the kind Amelia hadn’t worn in years.



People turned to look as they passed. The woman’s arm was hooked through Richard’s, her body pressed close, her lips curved into a knowing smile.



Amelia felt her pulse pound in her ears.



This couldn’t be real.



Richard stopped in front of her table, his expression unreadable.



""Amelia,"" he said, as if greeting a colleague, not his wife of nearly two decades. ""Meet Charlotte.""



Her fingers trembled as they gripped the edge of the table. She searched his face, waiting for the punchline, the explanation.



It didn’t come.



Charlotte extended a manicured hand, her voice light. ""It’s so nice to finally meet you.""



Finally?



Amelia’s chest tightened.



""What is this?"" she whispered, her voice barely carrying over the soft clatter of silverware and hushed conversations around them.



Richard exhaled, as if he was the one burdened. ""I wanted to do this properly.""



""Do what properly?""



His gaze remained cold, distant. ""Charlotte and I have been together for two years.""



Two years.



Amelia’s vision blurred for a moment.



Two years. While she had been waiting for him to come home, while she had been raising their children, while she had been celebrating his successes and picking up the pieces of his failures, he had been with her.



Her throat felt raw. ""Richard, this is our anniversary.""



""I know."" His tone was indifferent, detached. ""That’s why I thought it was the perfect time to tell you.""



A slow, creeping horror settled into her bones.



The perfect time.



Not an accident. Not a drunken mistake. A choice. Deliberate and cruel.



Amelia’s fingers curled into her lap, her nails digging into her palm to keep from breaking down in front of them.



""You’re leaving me,"" she stated, her voice eerily calm.



Richard pulled out a chair, sitting down as if this was a casual dinner and not the destruction of her entire life. Charlotte sat beside him, her hand resting on his.



He didn’t even hesitate. ""Yes.""



A sharp breath hitched in her throat.



""Why are you doing this?"" Her voice cracked.



""Because I love her,"" Richard said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.



Charlotte smiled, her fingers brushing over his knuckles. ""We didn’t mean for it to happen, but sometimes, love finds you when you least expect it.""



Amelia swallowed the bile rising in her throat.



""You're really doing this?"" she whispered.



Richard leaned back, studying her with something that resembled boredom. ""It’s already done. Your things are packed. The house belongs to Charlotte now.""



A sharp, suffocating silence settled between them.



Amelia couldn't move. Couldn't breathe.



""You packed my things?"" The words barely made it past her lips.



Richard nodded, completely unaffected. ""The driver is outside. He’ll take you wherever you need to go.""



Her stomach twisted painfully.



She wasn’t even worth a conversation. A warning. Nothing.



The betrayal ran so deep it was unbearable.



Then her phone vibrated. A message.



""Mom, please don’t make a scene. Dad deserves to be happy.""



Julia. Her eldest.



Her fingers trembled as she read the words again.



Another message popped up. ""We talked about it. We’re happy for Dad. Please don’t make this difficult.""



Ethan.



Tears stung her eyes.



She scrolled, her heart pounding. Mia. Her youngest.



""Charlotte is really nice. Maybe you should just let this go.""



The restaurant walls blurred.



Her hands went numb.



Her children had sided with them.



Her own flesh and blood, the ones she had carried, raised, nurtured, they had thrown her away as easily as Richard had.



Something inside her cracked.



She looked up, and for the first time in her life, she saw Richard for who he truly was. Not the man she had loved. Not the man she had sacrificed for.



A stranger.



A selfish, ruthless man who had taken everything from her without a second thought.



Her gaze flickered to Charlotte, who watched her with that same amused, pitying smile.



""Amelia,"" Richard said, checking his watch. ""Let’s not drag this out. The driver’s waiting.""



Something inside her snapped.



She stood slowly, her chair scraping against the floor. Every muscle in her body ached from the sheer weight of betrayal, but she refused to fall apart here.



She turned, walking away without another word.



Richard called after her, but she didn’t stop.



Not when she stepped out into the cold night.



Not when she reached the waiting car.



Not even when she sank into the backseat, her hands curled into fists on her lap.



The driver turned. ""Where to, ma’am?""



She had no home. No husband. No children.



She had nothing.



A single tear slipped down her cheek.



""Drive,"" she whispered.



As the car pulled away, Amelia stared out at the city lights.



One thought burned through the agony consuming her.



One day, they would regret this.



And when that day came, she wouldn’t be the one begging.



# Chapter 2

Chapter 2



Amelia sat frozen in the back of the car, her mind empty yet somehow overflowing with thoughts she couldn't grasp. The city lights blurred outside the window, smudges of color against the darkness. She hadn't given the driver any direction beyond that single word: ""Drive.""



""Ma'am?"" The driver's voice broke through her haze. ""I need to know where we're going.""



Amelia blinked, realizing they had been driving in circles for nearly an hour. Her throat felt tight, as if invisible hands were squeezing it.



""22w Westlake Bridge,"" she said, her voice hollow. ""Take me to the Westlake Bridge.""



22wThe driver's eyes met hers in the #2 mirror. Something like concern flickered across his face, but he nodded and turned the car toward the brwidge.



Her phone buzzed again. She stared at it, numb. More messages from her children.



\*Mom, please don't make this harder than it needs to be.\*



\*We still love you, but Dad deserves this chance.\*



\*Charlotte makes him happy. We just want everyone to be happy.\*



Happy. The word echoed in her mind, mocking her. What about her happiness? Twenty years of her life, poured into a family that had discarded her like she meant nothing.



The car slowed to a stop near the edge of the bridge. Rain had started to fall, soft drops pattering against the windows.



""We're here, ma'am,"" the driver said, his voice gentler than before. ""Would you like me to wait?""



Amelia looked at him, this stranger who showed more concern than her own family had. ""No,"" she whispered. ""You can go.""



He hesitated. ""It's raining. Are you sure you don't want me to....""



""Please,"" she cut him off. ""Just go.""



She handed him money, far more than the fare required. His eyes widened, but he took it without comment.



""Take care of yourself, ma'am,"" he said as she stepped out into the rain.



Amelia didn't answer. She stood on the sidewalk, watching as the car's taillights disappeared into the night. Then she turned toward the bridge, her steps slow and heavy.



The Westlake Bridge stretched before her, its lights reflecting off the water below. At this late hour, few cars passed. She walked to the middle of the pedestrian path, her clothes growing heavier with each step as the rain soaked through them.



She reached the railing and gripped it with both hands. The metal felt cold against her skin. Below, the dark water churned, angry and restless.



Twenty years.



Twenty years of waking up next to Richard, of kissing him goodbye in the mornings, of waiting for him to come home at night. Twenty years of planning surprise parties, of nursing him through illnesses, of celebrating his promotions and consoling him through setbacks.



Twenty years of raising their children. Of midnight feedings and diaper changes. Of scraped knees and school plays. Of homework help and driving lessons. Of college applications and graduation ceremonies.



Twenty years of her life, given freely, willingly, lovingly.



And in return?



""Your things are packed. The house belongs to Charlotte now.""



A sob tore from her throat, barely audible over the rain and the occasional car passing behind her. Her legs trembled, threatening to give way beneath her.



She looked down at her hands, at the wedding ring still on her finger. The diamond caught the light, sparkling despite the darkness surrounding it. She twisted it off, holding it between her thumb and forefinger.



This tiny circle of gold had once meant everything to her. A promise. A future. A life built on love and trust.



Now it was just a reminder of her foolishness.



She drew her arm back, ready to throw it into the water below, but something stopped her. Not sentimentality, no, that had been crushed the moment Richard walked into the restaurant with Charlotte. Instead, a cold, hard thought formed in her mind: this ring was worth money. Money she would need, now that she had nothing.



She slipped it into her pocket instead.



The rain fell harder, plastering her hair to her face and neck. She didn't bother wiping it away. What did it matter if she was wet? What did anything matter anymore?



Her phone buzzed again. She pulled it out, squinting at the screen through the rain.



Richard: \*The driver said he dropped you at Westlake Bridge. What are you doing there?\*



So he had been tracking her. Even now, when he had taken everything from her, he wanted to control her movements.



She didn't respond. Instead, she scrolled through her contacts, searching for someone, anyone, she could call. A friend, a relative, anyone who might take her in, at least for tonight.



But who? Most of her friends were Richard's friends too, or the wives of his colleagues. Her parents had passed years ago. Her sister lived across the country with her own family.



She was alone. Completely, utterly alone.



The realization hit her with physical force, making her stumble back from the railing. She had spent so many years being Richard's wife, the children's mother, that she had forgotten how to be Amelia. Just Amelia.



She had no career to fall back on. No skills that would earn her a living. No home to return to. No family to support her.



She was fourty years old, and she had to start over from nothing.



The weight of it crushed her. Her knees gave way, and she sank to the wet concrete of the bridge walkway. The rain mixed with her tears until she couldn't tell which was which.



Her phone buzzed again. And again. And again.



Richard: \*Answer me, Amelia.\*



Richard: \*You're being childish.\*



Richard: \*The children are worried.\*



She laughed, a broken sound that echoed across the empty bridge. The children were worried? The same children who had known about their father's affair and said nothing? The same children who had helped plan her exile?



Her laugh turned to sobs, wrenching from deep in her chest. She curled into herself, arms wrapped around her middle as if she could physically hold herself together when everything inside her was falling apart.



Time lost meaning. She could have been sitting there for minutes or hours, she couldn't tell. The rain continued to fall, colder now, and her body shivered uncontrollably.



Eventually, her sobs quieted, leaving behind a hollow emptiness. She stood on shaky legs and walked back to the railing. The water below looked darker now, more menacing. Or perhaps more inviting.



She leaned forward, her upper body hanging over the edge. The metal rail dug into her stomach, but she barely felt it. What was one more pain, when her entire being was already shattered?



It would be so easy. Just one moment of courage, one push over the edge, and it would all be over. No more pain. No more betrayal. No more starting over from nothing at forty-five.



Just peace. Quiet. An end to this overwhelming agony that threatened to consume her.



She closed her eyes, her grip on the railing loosening. The wind whipped around her, tugging at her clothes, at her hair, as if encouraging her to let go.



She thought of her children. Not as they were now, these strangers who had betrayed her, but as they had been. Julia, with her gap-toothed smile and pigtails. Ethan, serious and kind, always bringing her wildflowers from the garden. Mia, with her infectious laugh and boundless energy.



She thought of the life she had built. The home she had created. The love she had given, so freely, so completely.



And she thought of Richard. Not the man who had sat across from her at the restaurant, cold and distant, but the man she had fallen in love with. The man who had once looked at her like she was his whole world.



Something inside her shifted. Not healing, no, that would take much longer, but a tiny spark of something else. Something that felt almost like anger.



Why should she be the one to disappear? Why should she be the one to give up? Why should they get to live their lives, happy and unburdened, while she became nothing more than a sad memory?



She gripped the railing tighter, her knuckles white with the effort. She would not give them that satisfaction. She would not let them win.



But the thought came too late. Her foot slipped on the wet concrete, and for a terrible moment, she felt herself falling forward, the railing no longer enough to keep her on the bridge.



Time slowed. She saw the water below, dark and unforgiving. She heard the distant sound of a car horn. She felt the rain on her face, cold and relentless.



This wasn't how it was supposed to end. Not like this. Not because of them.



Just as her body tipped over the edge, a hand shot out, grabbing her wrist with surprising strength. The grip was firm, unyielding. A man's hand.



She gasped, her body suspended for a terrifying moment between life and death, the dark water still calling to her from below. Rain lashed against her face as she dangled, her fate held in a stranger's grasp.



The hand pulled, muscles straining against her weight. Amelia felt herself being dragged back from the brink, back to a world she no longer wanted to be part of.



Her eyes, blurred with rain and tears, could make out nothing but the silhouette of a man against the dim bridge lights. His hand, warm despite the cold night, held onto her with a determination she could not understand.



As her body swayed back toward the safety of the bridge, Amelia's mind filled with conflicting emotions. Relief. Disappointment. Anger. Confusion.



Why couldn't they all just let her go?



The man's fingers tightened around her wrist, an anchor in the storm that had become her life.



# Chapter 3

Chapter 3:



The strong hand pulled Amelia back over the railing. Her body crashed against the wet concrete of the bridge, lungs fighting for air. Rain pounded against her face as she lay there, caught between gratitude and fury that someone had stopped her fall.



""Amelia? My God, is that you?""



The voice cut through the storm, familiar yet impossible. She blinked through the rain, trying to focus on the man kneeling beside her.



""Amelia Carter. It is you.""



She squinted, her vision clearing enough to see his face. Recognition hit her like a physical blow.



""Lucas?"" Her voice cracked, barely audible over the rain.



Lucas County. Her childhood friend. The boy next door who had taught her to ride a bike, who had shared his lunch when bullies stole hers, who had been there through every skinned knee and teenage heartbreak until college pulled them in different directions.



Lucas, who she hadn't seen in twenty-two years.



""What are you doing here?"" she whispered.



He helped her to a sitting position, his hand steady on her back. ""I was driving by. Saw someone at the railing."" His eyes, still the same deep brown she remembered, studied her face. ""What happened, Amelia?""



The kindness in his voice broke something inside her. Fresh tears mixed with the rain on her cheeks.



""Everything,"" she said. ""Everything happened.""



Lucas removed his coat, wrapping it around her shivering shoulders. The expensive fabric felt heavy, warm despite the rain soaking through it.



""Come on,"" he said gently. ""Let's get you somewhere dry.""



She didn't resist as he helped her stand, her legs wobbly beneath her. A sleek black car waited nearby, engine running, headlights cutting through the rain.



""Is that yours?"" she asked.



Lucas nodded, guiding her toward it. ""My driver was circling while I walked back to look for my phone. I think I dropped it earlier."" His arm remained firm around her waist, keeping her steady. ""Good thing I did.""



The car door opened as they approached. A uniformed driver stood waiting, face carefully blank as he took in Amelia's drenched appearance.



""Home, sir?"" he asked.



""Yes, James. And turn the heat up, please.""



The interior of the car was warm, the leather seats soft beneath her. Lucas sat beside her, close but not touching, giving her space while remaining near enough to catch her if she fell again.



They drove in silence for several minutes. Amelia stared out the window, watching the city lights blur together. Her mind felt empty, too exhausted to process the bizarre twist that had brought her childhood friend back into her life on this of all nights.



""Do you want to talk about it?"" Lucas asked finally.



She turned to look at him properly for the first time. The years had been kind to him. His face had matured, lines around his eyes suggesting both laughter and stress, but his features remained handsome. His hair, once unruly brown curls, was now short, neatly styled. His clothes, what she could see beneath the rainwater, spoke of wealth and taste.



""My husband left me,"" she said, the words like glass in her throat. ""Tonight. At our anniversary dinner. For his secretary.""



Lucas's expression darkened. ""Richard, right? The business student?""



She nodded, surprised he remembered. ""Twenty years of marriage. Three children. And he told me my things were packed and the house belongs to his girlfriend now.""



Each word made the reality sink deeper. Fresh pain bloomed in her chest.



""Jesus, Amelia."" His hand found hers, warm against her cold fingers. ""I'm so sorry.""



The simple kindness nearly undid her. ""My children knew."" Her voice broke. ""They knew and they chose him. They helped him.""



Lucas's grip tightened. He didn't offer empty platitudes or worthless advice. He simply held her hand as the tears came again, quieter this time, the storm inside her temporarily spent.



The car slowed, turning through a set of massive iron gates. Amelia looked up, gasping softly as a sprawling mansion came into view, illuminated by tasteful landscape lighting despite the late hour.



""This is yours?"" she asked.



Lucas nodded, a hint of self-consciousness in his smile. ""Home sweet home.""



The car stopped at the front entrance. James opened the door, holding an umbrella over them as they stepped out. The rain had lessened to a gentle drizzle, but Amelia was already soaked to the bone.



The front door opened as they approached, a middle-aged woman in simple but elegant clothes waiting inside.



""Mrs. Parker, could you please prepare the east guest suite?"" Lucas asked. ""And perhaps find some dry clothes?""



""Of course, Mr. County."" The woman's eyes lingered curiously on Amelia before she hurried off.



The foyer was breathtaking, marble floors, a sweeping staircase, crystal chandelier casting warm light over everything. Amelia stood dripping on the expensive floor, feeling small and out of place.



""Come on,"" Lucas said, his hand gentle on her elbow. ""Let's get you warmed up.""



He led her through the house to a study. A fire burned in a stone fireplace, casting dancing shadows on the wood-paneled walls. Bookshelves reached from floor to ceiling, filled with leather-bound volumes. A large desk dominated one end of the room, while comfortable leather chairs clustered near the fire.



""Sit,"" he said, guiding her to the chair closest to the flames. ""I'll get you something to drink.""



Amelia sank into the chair, her body aching with cold and emotional exhaustion. She watched as Lucas moved to a sideboard, pouring amber liquid into two crystal glasses.



""Here,"" he said, handing her one. ""Whiskey. Best medicine for a night like this.""



She took a small sip, the liquor burning a path down her throat, spreading warmth through her chest. ""Thank you.""



Lucas sat in the chair opposite, studying her over the rim of his glass. ""When did we last see each other, Amelia? Your wedding?""



""No."" She shook her head. ""You couldn't make it, remember? Something about a startup in California.""



""That's right."" He nodded slowly. ""Must have been that summer after college, then. When you came home to visit your parents.""



""Twenty-two years ago."" The realization hung between them, a measure of all the life lived in between.



Lucas leaned forward, elbows on his knees. ""And now here we are.""



""Here we are,"" she echoed, glancing around the opulent room. ""Though it seems you've done quite well for yourself.""



A small, almost embarrassed smile crossed his face. ""That startup in California? Turned out better than expected.""



""Clearly."" She managed a weak smile in return. ""What exactly do you do, Lucas?""



""A bit of everything these days."" He swirled the whiskey in his glass. ""Started with tech, software for financial systems. Built that up, sold it, used the money to diversify. Energy, real estate, communications.""



""You're being modest,"" she said, recognizing the careful way he downplayed his success.



His smile widened slightly. ""If you must know, County Global is now the first-largest private corporation in the world.""



Amelia nearly choked on her whiskey. ""You're that Lucas County? The Lucas County? The one they call the 'Shadow King' because you own half the world but nobody ever sees you?""



He winced. ""I hate that nickname. But yes, guilty as charged."" His eyes met hers, suddenly serious. ""Fortune magazine might call me the richest man in the world, but I'm still just Lucas. The kid who ate lunch with you under the oak tree and helped you pass algebra.""



Before she could respond, Mrs. Parker returned, a folded stack of clothes in her arms.



""These should fit,"" she said, setting them on a side table. ""The guest suite is ready whenever you'd like to rest, Miss...""



""Carter,"" Amelia supplied automatically, then flinched. Soon that wouldn't be her name anymore. ""Amelia.""



""Thank you, Mrs. Parker,"" Lucas said. ""That will be all for tonight.""



The woman nodded and left, closing the door softly behind her.



""You should change,"" Lucas said. ""You'll catch pneumonia in those wet clothes.""



Amelia looked down at herself, suddenly aware of how she must appear, hair plastered to her head, makeup streaked down her cheeks, dress clinging to her like a second skin. ""Where can I...?""



""Through there."" He pointed to a door at the far end of the study. ""Private bathroom.""



She took the clothes and slipped into the bathroom, closing the door behind her. The room was larger than her bedroom at, no, not her bedroom anymore. The bedroom that had been hers until tonight.



The thought sent a fresh wave of pain through her chest.



She peeled off her wet clothes, letting them fall in a soggy heap on the marble floor. The mirror above the sink reflected a stranger, a middle-aged woman with hollow eyes and lines of grief etched into her face. This broken creature couldn't be Amelia Carter, the woman who had spent twenty years perfecting the role of wife and mother.



But then, she wasn't Amelia Carter anymore, was she?



The clothes Mrs. Parker had provided fit reasonably well, soft gray lounge pants and a blue cashmere sweater. Simple, expensive, comfortable. Amelia dried her hair with a towel and washed her face, erasing the last traces of the makeup she had applied so carefully for the anniversary dinner that now felt like it had happened in another lifetime.



When she returned to the study, Lucas was staring into the fire, his expression distant. He looked up as she entered, a small smile warming his features.



""Better?"" he asked.



""Warmer, at least."" She returned to her chair, picking up the whiskey glass again. ""Lucas, I don't know how to thank you.""



""For what?""



""For being there. For bringing me here."" She swallowed hard. ""For stopping me from falling.""



Understanding darkened his eyes. He reached across the space between them, taking her hand. ""Were you going to jump, Amelia?""



She looked away, unable to meet his gaze. ""I don't know. Maybe. I slipped, but... I don't know if I would have fought it if you hadn't grabbed me.""



His fingers tightened around hers. ""I'm glad I was there.""



""Why were you there?"" The question had been nagging at her. ""Of all the bridges in the city, at that exact moment...""



Lucas released her hand, leaning back in his chair. ""I was at a charity function downtown. Dropped my phone while getting into the car. Asked James to circle back while I looked for it."" He smiled faintly. ""Turns out it was in my pocket the whole time. But if I hadn't gone back...""



The implication hung in the air between them.



""Maybe it was meant to be,"" Amelia said, not believing in fate but unable to explain the coincidence any other way.



""Maybe."" Lucas finished his whiskey, setting the glass aside. ""Either way, I'm here now. And so are you.""



""What happens next?"" The question escaped before she could stop it, revealing the fear that lurked beneath her grief, the terrifying unknown that stretched before her.



Lucas studied her face for a long moment. ""Tonight, you rest. Tomorrow, we figure it out."" He leaned forward again. ""But I want you to know something, Amelia. You're not alone. Not anymore.""



""You barely know me anymore,"" she protested weakly. ""We haven't seen each other in over two decades.""



""I know enough."" His voice was firm. ""I know you were the kindest person I ever met. I know you were brilliant before Richard convinced you to drop out of law school. I know you deserved better than what happened tonight.""



Tears pricked at her eyes again. ""Lucas...""



""Stay here,"" he said. ""As long as you need. Get back on your feet. Figure out what you want. What you really want, without Richard or anyone else telling you.""



The offer was so generous, so unexpected, that Amelia couldn't find words to respond.



""You don't have to decide right now,"" Lucas continued. ""Just know the offer is there.""



""Why?"" she whispered. ""Why would you do this for me?""



Something flickered in his eyes, an emotion she couldn't quite name. ""Because once upon a time, you were the only person who saw me. Not the awkward scholarship kid. Not the brain people copied homework from. Just Lucas."" He smiled, a hint of sadness in it. ""Some debts can never be repaid.""



Amelia felt a strange warmth spreading through her chest, different from the heat of the whiskey or the fire. For the first time since Richard had walked into the restaurant with Charlotte, she felt something other than pain and humiliation.



She felt seen.



""Thank you,"" she said simply.



Lucas nodded, understanding in his eyes. ""It's late. You should rest.""



As he showed her to the guest suite, a space larger and more luxurious than any hotel room she had ever stayed in, Amelia found herself wondering what tomorrow would bring. The pain was still there, raw and throbbing beneath the surface, but something else had begun to take root alongside it.



A tiny seed of possibility.



She closed the door to the guest suite and leaned against it, exhaustion washing over her in waves. The king-sized bed looked impossibly inviting, the sheets turned down, a glass of water and two pills, aspirin, she guessed, waiting on the nightstand.



Amelia swallowed the pills and climbed into bed, her body sinking into the mattress as if it had been made for her. As sleep began to claim her, one thought drifted through her mind.



Twenty years ago, she had chosen Richard over her own dreams. She had molded herself into what he wanted, what her children needed, what society expected. She had become Amelia Carter, the perfect wife and mother, and buried the woman she might have been.



Perhaps it was time for that woman to rise again.



In the darkness of Lucas County's guest room, on the same night her husband had destroyed her world, Amelia allowed herself to imagine, just for a moment, what it might feel like to rebuild it, not for Richard, not for her children, but for herself.



And for the first time in twenty years, the future didn't look like a prison sentence.



It looked like freedom.



# Chapter 4

Chapter 4



Morning light filtered through cream-colored curtains, waking Amelia from a deep sleep. For a moment, she forgot everything, the disaster at the restaurant, Richard's cold eyes, her children's betrayal, the bridge.



Then reality crashed back, stealing her breath.



She sat up, taking in the unfamiliar room with its king-sized bed, plush carpet, and expensive furniture. Lucas County's guest room.



A knock at the door startled her.



""Yes?"" Her voice sounded hoarse from crying.



The door opened slightly, and Mrs. Parker's head poked in. ""Good morning, Miss Amelia. Mr. County asked me to check if you're awake. Breakfast is ready whenever you'd like to come down.""



""Thank you. I'll be there soon.""



Amelia shuffled to the bathroom, wincing at her puffy eyes and tangled hair in the mirror. The bathroom counter held new toiletries, all expensive brands. A fluffy robe hung on the door.



She brushed her teeth, splashed cold water on her face, and put the robe on over her borrowed clothes before heading downstairs.



The mansion was even more impressive in daylight. Sunlight streamed through tall windows, highlighting artwork that belonged in museums. Fresh flowers sat in crystal vases on antique tables.



She followed the smell of coffee and found herself in a bright kitchen with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking manicured gardens. At the center island sat a young woman reading something on a tablet.



She looked up as Amelia entered, her face breaking into a curious smile. She had Lucas's deep brown eyes, but her face was finer, more delicate. Her dark hair fell in loose waves past her shoulders.



""You must be Amelia,"" the girl said. ""I'm Eva. Lucas's daughter.""



""Hello, Eva. It's nice to meet you."" Amelia tugged self-consciously at the robe. ""I'm sorry about my appearance.""



Eva waved dismissively. ""Don't worry about it. Dad explained what happened."" Her eyes softened. ""I'm sorry.""



The simple words brought a lump to Amelia's throat. She nodded, unable to speak.",1,1750922133.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

﻿



Marrying Archie Knight, a renowned hotel tycoon in England, was supposed to be the start of a perfect life. I loved him, trusted him, and above all—I dreamed of building a family with him.

But that dream shattered in an instant. Just when I finally conceived the child I longed for, Archie took them away from me in the cruelest way possible. And as if that wasn’t enough, he had the audacity to come to me, asking me to adopt the baby he fathered with another woman.

Now, I stand at a crossroads—remain his foolish wife or burn down the world he built on lies.

I have lost my child—but I will not lose myself.

This time I decided to leave completely and let him live in a cage of regret forever.

——

CHAPTER 1

God granted my wish for a child in the fifth year of my marriage to Archie Knight, a renowned hotelier and owner of The Royal Oak Hotel Group. I thought it was a blessing—a long-awaited happiness finally within my grasp. But none of it mattered when I discovered the truth. My husband never wanted a child with me.

I awoke in a hospital bed, my body weak, a sharp pain stabbing through my abdomen. Instinctively, my hand reached for my stomach—only to find it empty.

My child… gone.

A fall in the bathroom. Blood. Darkness.

I struggled to remember, but something held me back. And then, from beyond the hospital door, I heard a voice. A voice I knew all too well.

""Wendy doesn’t need to know. Let her believe the miscarriage was her own carelessness.""

The breath caught in my throat. It was Archie.

""You’re fucking insane!"" That was Dr Dallas, my obstetrician—Archie’s best friend. ""She’ll despise you when she finds out the vitamins she trusted to protect her pregnancy killed her child. And you—"" his voice wavered with disgust ""—you are the one responsible.""

My body turned to ice. Vitamins?

I remembered how Archie had always been so insistent that I take them. He claimed they would keep me strong, ensure a healthy pregnancy. And I had trusted him. Every dose, every pill—I had taken them diligently, never questioning.

But every time, my stomach had burned. A slow, creeping heat, a sensation I had dismissed as normal. Until that night.

The night I collapsed in the shower, blood pooling at my feet. The night it all ended.

Archie had planned it from the start.

I wanted to storm through that door, to demand the truth, to scream at him. But his next words shattered me completely.

""Claire has just given birth,"" he said, his tone composed, almost gentle. ""I’ll convince Wendy to adopt our baby. By then, my son with Claire will be part of our family.""

My body froze. Claire.

My cousin.

His ex-girlfriend.

My mind reeled back to our wedding day, five years ago. Archie was never meant to marry me. He was meant to marry Claire. But she had disappeared just before the ceremony, and at Grandfather James’ insistence, I had taken her place.

And now she had returned—bringing Archie’s child with her.

""I married her because of Grandfather’s will,"" Archie continued, his voice devoid of warmth. ""I thought I loved her. But not anymore—not after what she did.""

My breath hitched.

So that was all I had ever been? A stand-in? A convenient replacement for the woman he truly wanted?

I had believed him. I had loved him. I had dreamed of building a family together.

I clenched my fists beneath the sheets, blinking back tears.

He thought he had won.

I would let him believe that. For now.

The door opened, and Archie stepped inside, his face a mask of concern, his expression carefully crafted.

""Wendy, you’re awake."" He rushed to me, wrapping me in an embrace, pressing kisses to my face as if I meant something to him. As if I mattered.

I did not respond.

He had never cared for me—not truly.

But I would make him pay.

Three days passed before I was discharged from the hospital. I stood at the entrance, staring at the empty driveway. Archie had not come to collect me.

Instead, he had sent his assistant.

""Come, Mrs Knight."" Caleb, the man who had long been tasked with handling my affairs while Archie busied himself with his empire, gestured towards the waiting car.

I swallowed my disappointment—an emotion I had grown far too accustomed to. Without a word, I stepped into the vehicle. Caleb shut the door behind me, and the journey home began in silence.

To distract myself, I reached for my phone. A notification appeared. A post on social media.

I tapped it open— and my world crumbled all over again.

A photograph.

Archie and Claire.

They stood side by side in front of a maternity hospital. She was smiling—radiant, joyful. Archie, though turned slightly away from the camera, was unmistakable. He held a newborn wrapped in white, his posture protective.

The caption beneath the image twisted the knife deeper.

\[Welcome, our little son. The most beautiful gift of our lives.\]

My hands trembled.

Archie wasn’t even trying to hide it.

Tears burned at the back of my eyes, but I refused to let them fall.

I had been clinging to a sliver of hope that somewhere, buried beneath all the cruelty, he still cared for me.

But I had been wrong.

Foolishly, painfully wrong.

I curled my fingers into fists. No more tears.

Not for the man who had destroyed me.



CHAPTER 2

I was sitting on the bench in the back garden, letting the afternoon breeze cool my skin when the sound of approaching footsteps reached my ears. I didn’t need to turn around to know who it was.

""What are you doing out here alone?"" Archie’s voice was light, almost as though nothing had ever happened between us.

I shrugged, keeping my gaze fixed ahead. ""Just needed some fresh air.""

He nodded slowly before settling beside me, cradling a tiny baby wrapped snugly in a blue blanket.

""I hope you don’t mind me bringing him along,"" he said, offering a small smile. ""He’s still too little to be left on his own.""

I turned my head slightly, feigning curiosity as I regarded the sleeping infant. ""Whose baby is this?"" My tone was deliberately flat.

Archie hesitated before finally answering, ""An acquaintance’s… He couldn’t take care of him, so I was considering adopting him.""

I glanced at him then, arching a brow. ""Adopt him?""

He nodded, his expression growing serious. ""Yes, Wendy. His name is Zac. I know losing our baby was devastating for you. I felt it too."" His voice softened, as though he were carefully choosing his words. ""But maybe this is a second chance for us. We could raise him together—as our own child.""

I looked at the baby, then back at him. ""Are you sure this is what you want?""

""Yes,"" Archie said with quiet conviction. ""He needs a family, Wendy. And I think we could be good parents to him.""

I suppressed the cold smile that threatened to form on my lips. Did he really think I wouldn’t see through this? That I would blindly accept a child—his child—without questioning its origins? How stupid did he think I was?

I let out a soft sigh, pretending to waver. ""I don’t know, Archie… Adopting a child is a big decision. I need time to think.""

His expression softened, as though he truly believed I was considering it. ""I understand. I don’t want to pressure you,"" he said gently. ""But I do think this could be a new beginning for us.""

A new beginning.

I lowered my gaze, masking the chill in my heart behind a thoughtful façade. If he thought I would fall for his game, he was sorely mistaken.

Sunday

The towering glass façade of Ravenwood Law reflected the golden hues of the late afternoon sun as

I stood before it, my resolve solidified. Today, I was filing for divorce from Archie Knight.

I stared at the entrance, my breath steady yet weighted. For too many years, I had allowed myself to be a fool, trapped in a marriage that had been nothing more than a carefully constructed illusion. But no more. If Archie had chosen his path with Claire, then I would carve out my own.

With purposeful steps, I entered the building, my heels clicking against the polished floor of the near-empty lobby. The receptionist directed me upstairs, leading me to an office at the end of a long, cool-toned corridor. The air-conditioning was crisp, but it did nothing to quell the fire in my chest.

I took a seat in a sleek leather chair, my hands clasped in my lap, fingers curled into fists. It wasn’t long before the door opened, and a man stepped inside, a file in hand.

""Good afternoon, Mrs Knight,"" came his deep, measured voice.

I turned towards him—and felt the ground shift beneath me.

Leon Aldrich.

For a moment, the world around me blurred. I knew him. Not just as a lawyer. He was someone from my past. Someone from a time before my life had become entangled with Archie Knight.

His gaze flickered with recognition, but it was brief—quickly replaced with the cool professionalism he had always exuded. He pulled out a chair across from me, placing the file on the desk before him.

""It’s been a long time,"" he said, his tone quieter now. ""I never expected you to walk into my office as a client.""

I swallowed, willing my emotions into submission. ""I didn’t expect to see you here either.""

Leon studied me for a moment, as though searching for something beneath the mask I wore. ""So, you want to file for divorce from Archie?""

I straightened my spine. ""Yes. I can’t continue in this marriage any longer.""

His expression remained unreadable. ""Are there specific terms you want to include in the settlement? Asset division? Custody arrangements?""

I exhaled slowly. ""I don’t want anything from Archie. I just want to walk away.""

Leon frowned. ""No claim on the estate? Wendy, you do realise who your husband is. You know he won’t let this end quietly.""

I met his gaze, unwavering. ""I’m ready for whatever comes.""

He studied me for a beat before allowing a small, knowing smile to ghost across his lips. ""You haven’t changed. Still as stubborn as ever.""

A humourless chuckle escaped me. ""And you’re still the same. Always able to see straight through me.""

Leon’s gaze lingered a moment longer before he sighed, leaning back slightly. ""Very well. I’ll handle everything.""

He picked up a pen, flipping through the documents in front of him with the same precision I remembered from years ago. His sharp eyes scanned the legal text—the papers that would officially sever my ties to Archie Knight.

""Tell me everything I need to know, Wendy,"" he said, his voice calm but firm. ""The more I know, the better I can protect you.""

I bit my lip, hesitating before speaking. ""I want this over as quickly as possible, Leon. I don’t care about the money, the properties—any of it. I just want to be free.""

His eyes darkened slightly. ""Are you sure? You’ve given years of your life to this marriage. Don’t let him dictate how it ends.""

I shook my head. ""There’s nothing to fight for, Leon. It was all an illusion.""

He let out a slow breath, closing the file momentarily.

""Alright. But you do realise Archie won’t let this go easily. He’ll either try to hold onto you—or make your life hell for trying to leave.""

I had no doubt about that. Archie never relinquished control willingly.

""I’m prepared,"" I said firmly. ""No matter what he does, I won’t change my mind.""

Leon studied me once more before nodding. ""Then we’ll begin immediately.""

He slid a document across the desk, placing a pen beside it. ""Sign here. This is the formal petition for divorce.""

I took the pen, my fingers trembling ever so slightly. Not out of fear or hesitation, but because this was it—the moment I was finally taking control of my own life.

With a deep breath, I signed my name.

Leon took the paper back, glancing at my signature before meeting my eyes. ""You’ve just taken the first step, Wendy.""

I nodded. ""I know.""

Something flickered in his gaze—an unreadable emotion he quickly concealed. I ignored it, focusing instead on the weight lifting from my chest.

""Is there anything else you want me to arrange?"" Leon asked, his voice quieter now, as though sensing the storm still brewing within me.

I met his eyes, my resolve hardening. ""Yes,"" I murmured. ""I want a new identity. I don’t want Archie to ever find Wendy Clark again.""

Leon’s brows lifted slightly, but he masked his surprise well. And then, after a brief pause, he nodded. A silent promise that my request would be granted.

A slow, knowing smile played at his lips. ""Welcome to your new beginning, Wendy.""

I let out a breath I hadn’t realised I was holding.

Yes. This was a new beginning.

And I would never look back again.



CHAPTER 3

My steps halted in the doorway, my chest tightening at the sight before me. Archie sat on the sofa with a woman beside him—Claire. The very woman who had torn my household apart.

I shouldn't have been surprised. I knew this would happen. Yet, seeing it with my own eyes made my heart feel as though it were being crushed.

Claire sat gracefully, her sweet smile unwavering, as if she had done nothing wrong. In her arms, she cradled a baby—a baby that wasn’t just any child. It was Archie's. The child of the man who was still my husband.

As my gaze met Archie's, I saw the shock in his eyes. He immediately stood up and approached me, attempting to act as though this situation were entirely normal.

""Wendy, where have you been?"" His tone carried a hint of irritation, yet his lips still curled into a smile, as if everything was perfectly fine.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t even want to acknowledge him at that moment.

Instead, my attention shifted to Claire, taking note of the way she looked at me—an expression difficult to decipher. There was pride in her eyes, as though she had just won something.

Archie, noticing where my gaze had landed, quickly spoke.

""Oh! Claire has just returned from Scotland,"" he said in a casual, almost excited tone. ""She's here to see our son.""

Our son.

The words echoed in my mind.

""That’s not our son, Archie,"" I said firmly.

Both Archie and Claire appeared taken aback, exchanging glances.

Before Archie could respond, I continued, ""But if you want him to be part of this family, I don’t mind.""

My words seemed to confuse them even further.

I didn’t care what they thought. I was done pretending.

I knew Archie wouldn’t find it easy to reveal Zac’s true identity.

""Welcome, Claire,"" I greeted her with a polite smile. ""I hadn’t realised you were still in contact with my husband. Ah, I mean, your former lover—the one you left at the altar.""

Claire’s smile faltered slightly, though she managed to maintain it. She gazed at me with that ever-pleasant expression, yet I could see something calculated lurking beneath.

""Yes, we’ve remained on good terms,"" she replied lightly. ""Besides, weren’t we best friends before all that happened?""

Best friends, she said?

Yes, we had been. Archie, Claire, and I were once inseparable at school. Claire had always liked Archie, which had put a strain on our friendship. They had created their own world, shutting me out of it. And yet, fate had eventually made me part of Archie’s life instead.

And now, Claire had returned—after causing chaos at the wedding ceremony five years ago—acting as though she had done nothing wrong?

""Of course, I haven't forgotten,"" I said ambiguously. ""If you want your world back, I'll gladly step aside.""

Without waiting for a response, I stepped into my bedroom, shutting the door behind me. Pressing my back against it, I exhaled deeply, the tightness in my chest creeping back in.

Did they take me for a fool?

Did they truly believe I would welcome their child with open arms and love it as if it were my own? No. I would not waste my life. I would not waste a lifetime on them.

How could I love their baby when mine lay buried beneath the damp, dark earth?

Just as I was about to compose myself, my phone vibrated on the nightstand. I frowned as I saw Leon’s name flash across the screen.

\[Tomorrow. Harvest Café. Nine o’clock. I’ve got what you need.\]

My heart skipped a beat. He had done it.

A new identity.

An identity that would erase Wendy Clark from this world.

CHAPTER 4

I hadn't objected when Archie asked me to settle Zac for his nap. Regardless of his origins, the baby was innocent. His presence was merely a tool for his selfish parents, and I couldn’t bring myself to hate him for that.

And yet, as I cradled him in my arms, I couldn't ignore the way my chest ached. Looking at Zac was like staring directly at their betrayal. At the night they had spent together, tangled in passion, exchanging whispered promises and sweat, conceiving the child now nestled in my embrace.

I had seen enough in the way Archie looked at Claire—so deeply, so reverently. The gaze that had once belonged to me was now hers entirely.

Soft footsteps approached, the sound of heels tapping against the marble floor in a careful, deliberate rhythm. I didn’t need to turn my head to know who it was.

""Wendy,"" a sweet voice greeted me.

I exhaled slowly, refusing to let her presence unnerve me.

Claire’s footsteps echoed closer, her stiletto heels clicking against the floor. Yet, she moved carefully—as if not wanting to wake Zac.

How motherly.

""I already know, Claire,"" I murmured, keeping my voice level. ""There's no need to pretend anymore.""

""Ah, Wendy,"" she sighed dramatically, though her cunning eyes never left mine. ""Archie and I love each other. We were always meant to be together.""

I let out a bitter laugh. ""Is that so? Then why did you leave him at the blessing ceremony? Why drag me into this farce of a marriage, only to return years later acting as if nothing happened?""

Claire folded her arms across her chest, her expression unreadable.

""You should have realised by now, Wendy—you were never meant to be with Archie.""

My grip on Zac tightened, but I remained composed.

""I never asked for him,"" I said. ""It was you who left. You made this bed, Claire. Now, don’t act like you’re some innocent victim.""

If Zac hadn’t been here, I would have screamed those words at her.

""Stop playing the victim?"" Claire scoffed. ""How could I, when you ruined my life? When you killed my father?""

I froze, staring at her in disbelief. ""Me? Your father died in an accident, Claire. I had nothing to do with it.""

Claire’s eyes burned with resentment. ""He wouldn’t have been in that accident if not for your father’s ridiculous request!""

I closed my eyes, inhaling sharply.

The past came rushing back—years ago, when Claire and I had been young. When we had been friends. When our fathers had worked side by side at Grandfather James’ company—Archie’s grandfather.

I still didn’t understand where her hatred stemmed from. All because my father had made a request? Even though he, too, had died that day?

My father had been suffering from a rare disease. Claire’s father—his younger brother—had spent days searching for medicine across the city. But exhaustion took its toll. He never made it home.

And yet, Claire refused to see reason. She blamed me for everything.

""After making my father die, you took Archie away from me,"" she spat. ""You took everything that was mine.""

""I told you—I never took him from you!"" My voice trembled with frustration. ""And I didn’t kill your father! You need to stop blaming me for fate!""

Claire’s lips curled into a cruel smile.

""Fate?"" she whispered. ""Fate didn’t make my father get into that car that night. Fate didn’t make Archie fall for you instead of waiting for me.""

I clenched my fists. ""You left him. You made that choice.""

Claire shrugged, then her expression darkened.

""But I’m back now,"" she said softly. ""And I’m taking back what’s mine.""

A cold shiver ran down my spine.

Zac stirred, whimpering in his sleep.

Before I could react, Claire turned towards the cot, her eyes glinting with something unreadable. She smiled, stroking his tiny hand. Then, without warning, she raised her voice.

""Please, Wendy, don’t!"" she cried out, her tone laced with fear.

I blinked in shock.

""Wendy—how could you?!"" Claire gasped dramatically. ""You were trying to hurt Zac—!""

The room spun.

""What?"" My voice came out hoarse, breathless. ""Bloody hell, that’s not true!""

Claire stumbled back as if recoiling in horror. And then—

Footsteps thundered down the hall.

Archie burst through the door, eyes wild. He took in the scene—Zac crying, Claire’s stricken expression—and then turned to me.

""What the hell is going on?"" His sharp gaze flickered between us.

Claire hiccupped, her tears flowing effortlessly. ""I was just telling Wendy the truth,"" she sobbed. ""But she—she got angry and tried to harm Zac. I tried to stop her, but she lashed out at me instead.""

My stomach twisted. ""What?!""

Archie’s expression darkened as he looked at his son’s red, wailing face.

""Wendy,"" his voice was low, dangerous. ""Tell me Claire is lying.""

I opened my mouth, my mind racing for words, for anything—but Zac’s cries only grew louder.

I saw it then. The way Archie’s jaw tightened. The way his eyes burned with suspicion.

And I knew—he had already made his choice.

His voice was ice when he spoke. ""I can’t believe you, Wendy.""

Tears pricked my eyes. ""I didn’t do anything, Archie! You have to believe me!""

Archie laughed—a sharp, bitter sound.

""Believe you?"" His gaze seared into me. ""How many times have I believed you, Wendy? And what has it ever given me? You couldn’t even take care of your own pregnancy—when I was so looking forward to it!""

My breath hitched.

""You weren’t looking forward to it!"" I snapped, my voice breaking. ""You—you killed my son for him!""

A sharp crack filled the air.

Pain exploded across my cheek.

I stumbled back, my face burning. My hands trembled as I touched my skin, realising—Archie had just slapped me.

A stunned silence fell between us.

Archie exhaled slowly, shaking his head. ""I can’t do this anymore,"" he murmured. ""I won’t do this anymore. You always play the victim, Wendy. But maybe it’s time you realise—you were never the victim at all.""

I stood frozen, tears blurring my vision.

But what truly shattered me—what drove the knife deeper into my chest—was what he did next.

He turned away.

Walked to Claire.

And as I watched, powerless, he reached out—stroking Zac’s head, his touch tender, affectionate.

A family.

Their family.

As if I had never even been part of his life at all.



CHAPTER 5

After that argument, I decided to leave the house and head to the Harvest Café to meet Leon and discuss my divorce from Archie. He had promised to help me erase Wendy Clark’s identity for good.

A large envelope lay on the table in front of him.

""Here,"" he said, shoving it towards me. ""Everything you need is inside.""

I hesitated before taking it, my fingers brushing against the crisp paper. Slowly, I unfolded it. Inside was a new identity card, a new passport... and the divorce papers I had been waiting for. Finally, everything was in my hands.

""Are you absolutely sure about this, Wendy?"" Leon asked, his voice laced with concern.

I met his gaze with a steely stare. ""There’s nothing left for me here, Leon. Archie has taken everything. Now it’s my turn.""

He sighed, rubbing his jaw. ""Once Wendy Clark disappears, she’s not coming back.""

""I have no reason to bring her back,"" I muttered firmly. ""Wendy Clark is dead.""

Leon straightened, his expression unreadable. ""Well, I’m sorry about your situation,"" he said. ""I’ll send you the details of the plan later tonight.""

I nodded and ended our meeting.

I had just climbed the stairs when a voice from the room beneath stopped me in my tracks. The door was slightly ajar, so I approached cautiously.

Archie. He was standing behind Claire, his arms wrapped around her waist in a far-too-intimate embrace.

""Oh, Claire, I’ve missed your touch so much. I feel like I’m going insane,"" he murmured.

Claire let out a soft chuckle. ""We used to do it all the time before I had the baby, Archie.""

""That was ages ago,"" he whined. ""Don’t you feel bad for me?""

""You were always so scared Wendy would find out, yet you’ve never been able to control yourself,"" she teased.

I clenched my fists. So this is what they did when I wasn’t around? I should have bloody known.

Archie waved his hand dismissively. ""Relax, Wendy’s not here. Come on, I can’t take it anymore.""

""Is it okay for us to just do this? I’m still recovering.""

I watched as Archie lit up like a kid being given his favourite toy. I had seen enough.

Heart pounding, I turned on my heel, ready to escape to my room.

But once again, I was stopped in my tracks.

""See? A woman who can’t even carry a pregnancy to term, running off instead of taking care of her husband and child? How disgraceful!""

I turned around to face Charlotte Knight—my mother-in-law—wearing an expression of pure contempt. My chest felt hollow, as if a part of me had been ripped away. The old woman stood a few steps away, her gaze filled with unfiltered hatred.

""You couldn’t even take care of your own husband. Archie marrying you was the biggest mistake of his life.""

My hands instinctively curled into fists, but I let her continue her verbal assault. No matter what I did, I would always be the villain in her eyes. I wanted to scream that it wasn’t my fault.

That I had done everything to protect that baby.

But what was the point? To her, I was nothing but a disgrace to the Knight family.

Before I could say a word, Archie’s deep voice rang out behind me.

""Mum, that’s enough!""

I turned to see him striding towards us, his jaw tight.

""Wendy just had a miscarriage,"" he snapped. ""Leave her alone. Don’t make it worse.""

Charlotte snorted, crossing her arms. ""You’re too soft, Archie. If you keep defending her, how will you explain this to the public? You’re the heir to this family, and now you have no child! The Knights need an heir.""

Archie ran a frustrated hand down his face. I saw the hesitation in his eyes, the weight of it all pressing down on him, as if I were a burden he couldn’t shake.

""I’ll take care of it, Mum.""

""You should be proud to carry the Knight name. Don’t disappoint me, Archie."" With that, Charlotte scoffed and walked away.

I turned to enter my room when Archie’s sharp voice cut through the air.

""Where are you going? Running away from your responsibilities as Zac’s mother?""

I stopped, my hand hovering over the door handle.

""Zac’s been crying all day, and Claire’s exhausted,"" he continued.

I looked away. ""I just needed some fresh air.""

Archie scoffed, His lips twisting in mockery. ""Fresh air, huh? With another man?""

I frowned. ""What are you talking about?""

Before I could demand an explanation, Archie threw a stack of printed photos at me. They scattered across the floor, and my breath caught in my throat as I saw myself in them—with Leon.

Where the hell did he get these?

""You always act like I’m the cheap man here,"" Archie seethed. ""But is this what you do behind my back?""

""No, Archie, I—""

""How many men have you been sneaking around with? Is that why you lost the baby? Did you spread your legs for them so much you couldn’t even keep our child?""

A stunned silence followed his words. The world around me blurred with fury. Without thinking, I swung my hand, slapping him hard across the face. The crack echoed in the hallway.

Archie turned back to me slowly, his gaze ice-cold. So cold it could freeze hell over.

Before either of us could speak, a soft voice rang out.

""Archie…""

Claire.

My stomach twisted as she sauntered towards us, draped in a delicate dress that hugged her curves. She barely spared me a glance before fixing her honeyed gaze on Archie.

""I think Zac misses his daddy,"" she purred. ""He won’t stop crying, no matter what I do.""

Archie frowned. ""Didn’t he just fall asleep?""

""He didn’t sleep well.""

Archie sighed heavily, then turned and walked off towards Zac’s room.

Claire and I watched him go in silence. As soon as the door shut behind him, she turned to me with a sly smirk.

""Do you really think you can hold onto this marriage, Wendy?"" she whispered, stepping closer. ""The more you cling to him, the more I’ll make sure he’s mine. You’ll never get what you don’t deserve.""

I balled my fists, forcing myself to stay calm. I knew exactly what she was doing.

My eyes followed her as she moved towards the coffee table, picking up a small ceramic pot. She glanced at me again, her smirk widening.

""You should have died with your parents a long time ago,"" she sneered, taking another step closer.

Then, suddenly, she swung the flowerpot at me.

I dodged, and the pot crashed to the floor with a loud smash. My breath caught. What the fuck?

""You’re insane, Claire!""

But she wasn’t done. With a twisted look of determination, she knelt down, picked up a shard of glass, and—before I could react—dragged it across her own forehead. A thin line of blood welled up as she let out a sharp cry.

Footsteps pounded towards us.

""What happened?!"" Archie’s voice.

I turned to explain, but Claire was already whimpering pathetically, clutching at her forehead.

""Archie,"" she sniffled, ""Wendy threw a flowerpot at me!""

I froze.

What?!

Before I could protest, Archie was already at her side, gripping her shoulders anxiously.

""Are you alright?""

Claire bit her lip, looking utterly heartbroken. ""I don’t know why she got so angry… I just wanted to talk…""

My whole body trembled with rage. ""I didn’t do it!""

Archie’s furious eyes snapped to me. ""Wendy!""

""I swear, I didn’t! She attacked me first and cut herself—""

Claire whimpered, burying her face in his chest.

""I know she’s mad at me for spending time with Zac,"" she murmured. ""But I never stopped her from holding him. I was only trying to help… I’d do anything for the heir to your family.""



CHAPTER 6

Archie fixed me with a sharp glare, his voice as cold as ice.

""It was you who slipped in the bathroom, Wendy. You were the one who wasn’t careful, and now you’re blaming Claire?""

I sat on the edge of the bed, my body still aching from the fall.

""You’re not a good wife,"" he continued without hesitation, his words cutting deep. ""You can’t even look after yourself properly. You took vitamins recklessly without consulting the doctor, then refused to care for Zac. Claire was only helping, but instead of being grateful, you lashed out at her?""

I looked up at him, my eyes burning. Not a good wife?

My fingers curled into fists, my nails digging into my palms. ""Not a good wife?"" My voice trembled, thick with the anger I was barely restraining. ""And what about you? Were you there when I fell? Did you even bother to check what was in those vitamins I took?""

Archie exhaled sharply, as if I was being insufferable. ""The family doctor prescribed them to you. They’re just vitamins to support your health—not that it seems to have helped much in the end. And as for the bathroom incident… that was purely your fault.""

I let out a cold, bitter laugh. ""My fault? You really think, out of everyone in this house, I’m the only one who could ‘accidentally’ take a tumble?""

His expression tightened with frustration. ""You always want to blame someone else. If you’d been more careful, none of this would have happened.""

I held his gaze.

A liar.

A traitor.

Before I could think twice, my hand darted to the dressing table, fingers wrapping around a pair of scissors. Without hesitation, I dragged the blade across my wrist.

A sharp sting. Then, warm blood spilled onto the floor.

Archie’s eyes went wide in horror. ""Wendy! What the hell are you doing?!""

I let the scissors clatter to the floor, my vision blurring. ""Just making amends."" My voice was eerily calm. ""You said I wasn’t a good wife, wasn’t a decent mum… so this is my punishment, isn’t it?""

I staggered towards the door, blood trailing behind me.

Just as I reached it, a soft, artificial voice rang out.

""Archie… I’m scared. Wendy… she’s dangerous.""

I froze. Slowly, I turned my head.

Claire was leaning against Archie, gripping his sleeve, her expression one of perfect, rehearsed fear.

Archie hesitated, his gaze flicking between us.

Claire tugged on his arm, voice frail. ""Archie, I feel dizzy… Can you take me to the hospital?""

Archie looked at me for a long moment. Then, as always… he made his choice.

He wrapped his arm around Claire and led her away.

I stood there, watching him walk off with another woman while I bled right in front of him.

At that moment, my phone vibrated. A message from Leon.

\[I’ve finalised the plan. Tomorrow, go to the Thames bridge. I’ll take care of the rest.\]

The message was like a breath of fresh air. Soon… I’ll be free of Archie’s life. Somehow.

The next morning, Archie still hadn’t come home.

I packed my things—all the designer dresses, jewellery, and gifts he had given me—and tossed them into a suitcase. Then, I retrieved our marriage certificate, the one I had once cherished so dearly, and ripped it apart. I let the pieces fall into the sink, set them alight, and watched them burn to ash.

As the last embers flickered, my phone vibrated again. A message from Archie.

\[Wendy, I’ve booked the venue for our wedding celebration. My assistant will pick you up shortly.\]

I stared at the message. Then, out of curiosity, I opened social media.

Claire had posted a photo.

She and Archie sat at a restaurant—the same one where our wedding celebration was supposed to be planned—holding hands across the table. Zac was in a stroller beside them, fast asleep.

My heart no longer ached.

I didn’t reply to Archie’s message. Instead, I took the signed divorce papers and handed them to a courier, instructing them to deliver them directly to the banquet.

Once everything was set, I called Leon.

""I’m ready.""

Taking my Mini Cooper’s keys from the dressing table, I drove towards the Thames bridge.

In the car, parked not far from the bridge, I watched them on the small dashboard screen.

Archie was in the VIP lounge with Claire and Zac, looking as if he didn’t have a care in the world.

So, this is what waiting for me looks like, is it, Archie?

I glanced down at my phone. Dozens of missed calls from him.

Oh, so now you’re desperate?

With Leon’s help, I had hacked into the restaurant’s CCTV. I’d also paid off a waiter to plant a listening device in their room. Now, I saw and heard everything perfectly.

The VIP room door burst open. Thomas, Archie’s assistant, rushed in, breathless and pale.

""Sir, Mrs Knight isn’t in the penthouse.""

Archie’s brows knitted. ""What do you mean?""

Thomas swallowed and placed a medium-sized box on the table. ""I… I found this in the courtyard. Alongside some burnt remains that were still fresh.""

Archie exchanged glances with Claire before prying the box open. His face went rigid.

With a sharp flick of his wrist, he knocked the box over, sending its contents scattering across the floor.

""What the is this?!""

Photographs spilled everywhere.

Shots of Archie and Claire at a hotel. On holiday. Kissing in a nightclub. Some of their most intimate moments.

Amongst the pile, a copy of Zac’s birth certificate landed face up. Archie's name was listed as the biological father. Claire as the mother.

And at the very top—a white envelope.

Inside, my signed divorce papers.

The room turned deathly silent.

Archie clenched his jaw, his hands balling into fists as he glared at the evidence.

Thomas shifted uneasily. ""Sir…""

""What now?!"" Archie barked, his temper flaring.

Thomas hesitated before shakily handing over his tablet. ""You need to see this.""

Archie snatched it, eyes widening as he took in the screen. A stock market graph was plummeting.

OAK GROUP SHARES TANKING

And beneath the headline, a more damning line of text:

""CEO SCANDAL EXPOSED! INFIDELITY & SECRET CHILD SHAKE COMPANY REPUTATION""

Archie went completely still. His face drained of colour.

Claire gasped, her hands covering her mouth.

""No… no, this can’t be happening,"" Archie whispered.

Before he could fully process the damage, Thomas spoke again, voice trembling.

""Sir… there’s more bad news.""

Archie whipped around, eyes blazing. "" just say it, Thomas!""

Thomas took a shaky breath. ""Mrs Knight’s car… fell from the Thames Bridge. A sixty-eight-foot drop. The police and rescue teams are on the scene.""

A cold, suffocating silence blanketed the room.

Claire clung to Archie’s arm, her nails digging in, but he didn’t react. His hands were still clenched, veins bulging under the pressure.

I smiled faintly.

From behind the wheel, I glanced at my phone one last time.

The wreckage of my Mini Cooper, floating in the murky depths of the Thames, was displayed across the news.

Goodbye, Archie.

1lktg5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1lktg5l/i_dont_know_if_i_hate_my_dad/,I don’t know if I hate my dad,"Anonymous post as I do not want anyone in my life to know. 
      I’m female 24 and have been the responsible person for a long time now…. I hate that I bear everyone’s problems as my own.. I don’t know when it all started all I remember is when I moved out. I was 21, living with my mom (at the time 52 y/o) and my two brothers (at the time 20 y/o and 24 y/o) and I moved into my dads. He was fired from his job (I don’t have a lot of details of what went down) but I moved in to help pay bills. I had a really nice paying job, and another part time job. I tried my best to help but I ended up ignoring my credit card bill and now it’s gone to collections…. During that time my dad (53) found himself a cooking job, it was a major pay cut, but we could afford the bare minimum. Where I live is expensive and if you don’t work for the local mines, you might as well be homeless. 
We did what we could, but my Dads heart condition got really bad, he’s at 22 stents and 2 heart clips, functioning at 26%. So he went on leave and ended up being let go from that job as he couldn’t go back to work in the required time frame after a major heart surgery. He found another cooking job and was let go for the same thing (this time it was a hernia surgery) 
         I always remained optimistic as I didn’t have a partner, I just needed my family and my dogs. My family has been broken for years though. Parents separated back in 2009, and have been rude to each other. My dad blames my mom for his financial ruin, and my mom blames my dad for everything she went through. My brothers don’t talk to my dad, and haven’t for years. I can’t remember what really happened I just remember a lot of yelling. Im the only child who still talks to both parents. Fast forward to 2023 I left my part time job to focus on my full time job, and a month after that I was let go from my full time job, there was an inappropriate joke that went around and I got caught saying it…. Totally my fault, I knew better. 
        And that’s how I met my partner. we’ve been together for 1 1/2 and he’s been absolutely amazing. Helped me out where he can. Loves my dogs, and me. I’ve never been happier…. But now…. My dad remains jobless, on unemployment for a year now, with no hope of getting a job… The job economy here is absolute shit. I apply him for jobs, I claim his unemployment benefits every week. I do everything I can. And nothing. All the responsibilities fall on me. And I’m tired of it. He doesn’t have a retirement plan, or 401K. I myself owe the IRS, the credit card, my car payment. And yet I still find myself being optimistic, I give what I can ,help out my friends when they need me. But yet….  I don’t get help. 

       I’ve tried talking to my mom about it but she’s so hateful against him it turns into a screaming match between us. I haven’t mentioned my dad in months because I’m tired of fighting. They both talk shit about one another it’s exhausting to hear. I shut myself out, my partner knows everything about my dysfunctional family, (I don’t like to celebrate holidays due to how broken my family is. And this man went out of his way from his own family this past Christmas to watch movies all day with me.) When people offer help, it’s not the help I need, I need my dad to get a job. I need money to help pay my bills. I’m not ungrateful for what I have. But it gets exhausting when I want to do something for me, and I can’t because I can’t afford it…. I wanna go to college, move in with my boyfriend and start my life. I don’t want to be stuck taking care of my dad anymore…… I hate to say it. I love him I really do, with all my heart…. But to end his own suffering??… that would mean death.. he cut off all his friends and family members. Talks shit about them, doesn’t let them help him (my uncle offered for him to move a state away so he can find a better job there) and he turned it down…. I hate him for that. I no longer look at him as my dad… more of like a bum roommate… I hate to admit this. I hate to be so optimistic that things will work out when it all looks so dark around me…. Idk what this really is, maybe a confession post. 

       But I’m so tired. I wanna be able to get out of debt while I can, have a happy family where my brothers talk to my dad. He misses them and has apologized but they ignored him. I’m tired of being the responsible one for him, I hate that I can’t go get a Starbucks coffee because “that $5 can be used for rent”. I don’t want him to be left alone here to die… and that’s why I stay. Because I love him. And I want him to be happy. But he’s such a hateful person. I don’t want to be surrounded by that. I’ve applied him for disability benefits, but he’s been denied 3 times because of his AGE. HIS AGE. He medically qualifies for disability, but he can’t because of his age. I even had his heart doctor help with fighting it. And we still got denied… i don’t know what to do anymore… I want to give up. 
        
          We’ve sold our bikes, forfeited the truck to the bank so we didn’t have to pay, we’ve sold a lot…. And it barely gets us by… I’ve been told by many people that I need to give up my dogs… but I can’t. All of my dogs have been there through everything. My oldest dog, was bought for me as a service dog to help with anxiety (my parents separation took a hug toll on me when I was a kid, and I didn’t talk, go outside or anything), all of my dogs and my partner make me so happy… so why would I get rid of them?…I do have a good paying job now (started back in sept 2024) but it’s not enough for me to pay ALL of my bills… I want to give up, move away and ignore all of the consequences doing so… I don’t know what will help at this point….",1,1750921058.0,TwoHotTakes,4,0.67,False

# Chapter 1 Three Years' Punishment

""I'm warning you one last time—keep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness… I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'

# Chapter 6 Replace Her

The next day, Athena was summoned to Margaret's courtyard.

When she arrived, Willow was already there, kneeling obediently beside Margaret, gently massaging her legs.

The moment Athena walked in, Willow scrambled to her feet in a panic. She greeted her timidly, ""Athena,"" then quickly stepped aside to give up her spot, looking every bit the picture of meekness and quiet suffering.

Nicolas frowned, clearly displeased. His voice was low and stern. ""Willow, you're also raised under this roof. You don't need to act so pitiful in front of her.""

Then he shot Athena a sharp look, his eyes full of disdain. ""No one in this house owes you anything. Who are you putting on that sour face for every day?""

Eloise gave a light cough into her handkerchief. ""Nicolas, that's enough.""

Nicolas glanced at her, then held his tongue—but his expression remained cold, and his eyes, harsh.

Athena understood then—he was speaking up for Eloise. He must have heard that she'd turned Eloise away the night before.

She looked over at Eloise, who wore a stiff, embarrassed expression.

Eloise seemed to want to say something, but when her eyes met Athena's icy gaze, she lost her nerve and backed off. Annoyed, she turned and snapped at Nicolas, ""Go check if your grandmother's medicine is ready.""

He knew perfectly well she was trying to send him away—and truthfully, he had no desire to face Athena's cold stare any longer. With a flick of his sleeve, he stormed out.

""Such a temper,"" Margaret muttered once he was gone, then beckoned to Athena. ""Athena, come here. Sit with Grandmother.""

Athena came forward and sat beside her. Margaret took her hand, her voice warm and affectionate. ""You've had a hard time.""

Athena placed her hand gently over hers. ""As long as I have you, Grandmother, it hasn't been so hard.""

Margaret let out a long sigh, then got to the point. ""Athena, there's something I want to ask you.""

""Of course, Grandmother. Please speak.""

""Do you still care for Michael? Is he really the only one for you?"" There was hesitation in her eyes, and a deep, pained concern in her expression.

Ever since Athena returned to the estate, the Osborne family had sent someone—very discreetly—to suggest replacing her in the engagement.

Not wanting Athena to be humiliated, Margaret had sent them away under a pretense.

Athena understood immediately. ""They want to call off the engagement?""

She had spent three long years locked away in a military camp—her reputation utterly ruined. Of course the Osborne family would no longer want a disgraced woman as a daughter-in-law.

Margaret nodded, clearly struggling to say it aloud. ""It's not quite breaking it off… They just want to marry someone else instead.""

Athena's eyes shifted to Willow, who quickly looked away, guilt written all over her face as she lowered her head.

It all made sense now.

Her reputation was in tatters. If the Osborne family officially broke the engagement, it would offend the Monson family and create bad blood.

But they didn't want her anymore. Swapping her for Willow—pure, innocent Willow—would be the perfect compromise. And more importantly, Willow was willing.

Everyone in the room was focused on protecting the duke's estate's reputation—yet not one of them had asked Athena what she wanted.

No wonder their expressions had all been so tense. They were afraid she'd cause a scene. Too bad for them—she wouldn't give them that satisfaction.

""Grandmother, I agree,"" Athena said, her face blank, her tone as calm as if she were commenting on the weather. ""I agree to the change in engagement.""

Margaret and Eloise stared at her, stunned.

""But you were once so in love with Michael. What made you change so suddenly?"" Margaret asked, clearly baffled.

Athena had once cared for Michael so deeply she would've laid down her life for him. That was the only reason Margaret had bothered to ask her in the first place.

But Athena's expression didn't waver. ""That was a long time ago, Grandmother. People change. I stopped caring about him ages ago.""

At that, Eloise let out a visible sigh of relief. She turned to Willow and gave her a knowing, tender smile.

Willow clung to her arm, eyes lowered, face tinged with shy delight.

The quiet exchange between the two made the whole situation feel even more absurd to Athena. The decision had clearly already been made—so she wondered, 'Why the charade of asking me?'

Margaret looked at Athena with deep sorrow in her eyes. ""Athena, don't be afraid. Even if the Osborne family backs out, I'll do everything I can to find you a good match.""

But she knew in her heart—Michael had been the best they could hope for.

With Athena's name in tatters, there was no way they could arrange a match of equal status now. No noble family would consider her. Her life, as far as society was concerned, was over.

Margaret felt a stab of grief—her precious Athena had endured too much.

But Athena just smiled faintly, as if it no longer mattered. ""All I want is to stay by your side, Grandmother.""

""Don't be silly."" Margaret sighed. ""You can't spend your whole life looking after me.""

She hated to see Athena wronged, but this was the best outcome left. If the Osborne family officially ended the engagement, Athena's reputation would be in complete ruin.

Before long, Margaret grew tired. After helping her settle in for a nap, Athena quietly stepped outside.

As she walked out, she handed a folded slip of paper to Marquita Huynh. ""From now on, prepare Grandmother's medicine using this prescription.""

Marquita looked surprised. ""Lady Athena, where did this come from?""

""A friend gave it to me. If you're unsure, feel free to have a doctor look it over."" Athena didn't elaborate. She handed over the prescription and walked away.

Just as she stepped through the gate, she stopped abruptly—Michael was standing right in front of her.

Backlit by the sunlight, he looked like a cold shadow descending upon her.

""Athena,"" he said, coming to a halt in front of her. His tall frame instantly blocked the sun.

The chill that radiated from him made her shiver. Even after three years, being this close still left a dull ache in her chest.

Suddenly, Michael seized her thin wrist, his voice low and icy. ""This engagement was settled years ago. You don't get to walk away from it.""",1,1750920697.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

Mainly having trouble with the queer woman aspect. I'm especially wanting to work through my internalized homophobia and I just don't think I can feel comfortable with a therapist who's not queer helping me work through that. I also come from a muslim immigrant family which adds another layer especially as someone who's left religion altogether. There are a small handful of female women of color therapists in my area in general, let alone brown women specifically. But if I lived in a big city I'd have so many options to choose from. I don't live in a rural area, but I live in a medium sized city in the Midwest. I found one therapist that I liked and thought I would work well with, but I made the mistake of looking her up on social media and I realized we have a lot of mutual friends including an ex. I don't know how I feel about that honestly. Part of me wants to see her anyway and maybe talk about that upfront especially because I haven't found anyone else I'm remotely interested in seeing. To be fair, it doesn't seem like we have super direct mutual friends, seems like we both worked at the same coffee shop at different points. And I would also feel sort of embarrassed to say that I stalked her on social media but I was just trying to get a better read on who she is and if she was queer.

I had a Robot since October, initially paired with a Kingrinder K6. I've usually gotten very good shots, and the channeling was exceptional.

With my last coffee order, I noticed the grinder wasn't working properly (it sounded strange and ground inconsistently). I decided to return it and froze the beans until I had a replacement.

Two days ago, I received a DF54, and at first, everything was perfect. But recently, I've noticed the coffee is coming out only through a few holes and in small bursts.

This shot I'm showing is 17.5g, ground at 4.5 on the adjustment dial (0 of which I'd say is set correctly). If I grind any finer, I'll drown the robot.

My body rises as the sun does, as if automatically. My eyes are opening as my feet are already two steps towards the bathroom. Thankfully my brain has come to by the time I'm sitting down. 

The chilly morning is crisp - *""boy, it's fresh""* I say out loud to no one in particular. My dog - Robin, not a boy - looks up in eager anticipation. She knows we're heading outside, and wasn't listening to me anyway.

My cup of morning joe steams profusely, akin to a train billowing through the countryside. By now I'm alert. Willingly in the sense that I did plan on waking up today. Begrudgingly in the sense that I personally prefer to mill about aimlessly some days. I don't know, it's nice to have no agenda sometimes. But alas, I have to write.

*I have to write to <insert yourself here>.*

I look out over my new slice of life, a vineyard, lifting my now cooler coffee to my pursed lips. The first of the liquid beans gently pass through, warming me slightly as they glide down into my empty stomach. ""Gross"" I blurt through a throaty exhale. 

I never really learned how to make a decent coffee at home. I never learned how to make an average coffee at home. I always relied on some local barista. They have the skills, and the machinery. And I spent all my money on this here vineyard. I don't even like shiraz. But honestly, the grapes are pretty nice. They're out of season though. It doesn't matter, I'm meant to be writing.

The sun is bright now, glistening over the treetops. Blinding me, because I like to stare down the rows of my neighbour's almond grove, and I keep forgetting that mornings are better to whimsically stare in the other direction. Whatever. Oh yeah, writing.

I bought a fountain pen just for this. I have a wax seal too, to complete my role-play as a budding messenger who dreams of not being shot. All my various writing and drawing tools are kept conveniently on this lazy susan. I never knew why it was called a lazy susan. I'M the lazy one. Was Susan the inventor, and was *she* lazy? Can you really call an *inventor* lazy? A lazy who then? Wait, this doesn't matter either. 

*I HAVE TO WRITE*

But wait, I forgot to get someone to write to. Fine. The book will have to wait. I can always write that great novel next year, or the year after. Right now, I need a penpal.

My chair swivels on the carpet, halting at the window. While rising with gusto, I remove my glasses dramatically. Now, through blurred vision, I avert my gaze to the ""camera"" that does not exist.

""Get me <insert yourself here>.""

 I (F24), was speaking to my sister (F23) the other day about what I have been experiencing currently, honestly I’ve never had an issue with memory or remembering stuff so when things felt out of place and I started to lose time, I didn’t know what to do or who to talk to, so now I’m here, keeping this anonymous so that I don’t have anyone in my life worry about me.

Moving on, as I mentioned, I was speaking to my sister, who is currently studying psychology, yes I know she’s not a psychologist, honestly, I didn’t even want to talk to her about it, but she brought up how exhausted I look, I haven’t smiled or laughed for the past couple of months and she asked if everything was okay.

Initially I wasn’t going to tell her anything, but I couldn’t bring myself not to, so I explained that I’ve been having trouble remembering certain things, like I went into work a few weeks ago and I just stood in the kitchen of the house, where I was completely confused and scared because I walked into someone else’s house without realising, I only figured out I was in the right place when one of my co-workers walked in, greeted me and asked if I would like some tea or coffee which I declined and a few seconds later, it’s like a switch flipped and I realised I was at work.

The second issue was when I was sat in one of the kids bedroom, he has autism and ADHD, we were watching TV, he loves Peppa Pig, so whilst we were watching and I was stroking his head (he has sensory needs and loves when staff run our hands through his hair), then like a switch has flipped, I’m now tickling the bottom of his feet (another sensory need he love’s) and I’m confused because I don’t remember him moving away from me and putting his feet right close to my face.

Another occasion is when I was chilling out at work, sat on the sofa, watching Tv, next minute I know I’m cleaning the dining room table since it was a mess after the two little ones had finished, were trying to teach/promote them about cleaning up after themselves, even though they do have adhd and autism, they are doing an exception job at putting their dishes away into the kitchen and all staff have to do is wipe down tables and hoover up.

I relayed this all to my sister, who explained to me that it’s maybe something to do with being sleep deprived since I pick up and do so many shifts when I don’t have to, I explained that I love my job, it’s the most chilled out one that any I have had previously, where I’m sat behind a desk, taking calls to people who shout down the line, coming into work 15 minutes earlier to get your computers started and not getting paid for those 15mins, managers counting every minute/seconds your away from your desk etc, etc.

My current job, I’ve been there for 1.5 years, I love it,  once I’ve done all the jobs, I’m basically chilling out since the kids are at school and I don’t have to worry about anything until they are all out at 3, I can go on my phone, watch TV, work on my own things I want to do and managers don’t count every minute/second your away, as long as I have all my little jobs done they’re happy and content.

My sister advised that I should get help/talk to a proper professional who’s licensed to talk and give solutions to people who are in my situation, since she’s not properly qualified to give advice on what to do here, honestly I wasn’t looking for any advice, I just wanted to tell her due to her genuine concerns, besides from that it felt good to explain it all out loud.

Originally I wasn’t going to bring anything up to anyone, but today, whilst I was on shift, I was sorting out medication for the kids, usually I know what they get since I’ve been doing it so long and I can do it with my eyes close, but idk, it’s like a switch flipped again and I just couldn’t remember what I was doing or why I was sorting meds out since they were already given, my senior, just looked at me confused, asked what’s wrong, and i just explained that I forgot what I was doing. He looked a bit worried for a second since I confided in him earlier that day since he was doing my supervision and I told him how I was doing, both personally and professionally.

He explained that I was sorting out meds for the morning, which then clicked into place and I had to ask him if he could repeat the medication that was to be given the kids and he did.

Honestly I was at a point where I wanted to cry, something so easy and I somehow forgot who gets what in the morning.

I’ve also had my first nose bleed today, idk if that indicated how stressed I am, but I think something has to change.

Idk what my next steps will be or who to go to, but I think I’m gonna take it one step at a time and try to take a couple of days off since maybe I am exhausted and need to catch up on a lot of sleep and try to relax somehow.",2,1750919841.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

each of the skull candles that made our list boasts a unique set of features. From the wax blends used to the intricacy of the sculpting, these elements contribute to the overall quality and appeal of the candle. We've considered burn time, scent throw, design detail, and overall aesthetic when evaluating these products.**Wax Blend:** Understanding the wax blend is crucial for determining burn time and scent throw.

The type of wax directly impacts how long the candle will burn and how effectively it distributes it's fragrance. Soy wax is known for its clean burn and excellent scent throw, while beeswax offers a natural, subtle fragrance and a longer burn time. paraffin wax, while less expensive, may produce more soot.Many high-quality skull candles now utilize proprietary blends of natural waxes to maximize these benefits, creating a product that is both eco-conscious and aesthetically pleasing.

**Sculptural Detail:** The level of detail in the skull's design sets the aesthetic tone.

A finely sculpted skull candle transforms a simple wax object into a work of art. The depth and intricacy of the details, such as bone structure, eye sockets, and teeth, contribute significantly to the visual impact of the candle. Premium skull candles often employ master sculptors to create the initial mold, ensuring that each reproduction captures the subtle nuances and character of the original design. This level of artistry elevates the candle beyond a mere decorative item, making it a conversation piece.

**Scent Profile:** The fragrance enhances the overall sensory experience.

**Do skull candles have a strong scent throw?**

The scent throw of a skull candle depends on the quality and concentration of the fragrance oils used.High-quality candles with a high fragrance load will have a stronger scent throw than lower-quality candles. Some wax types, such as soy wax, are known for their excellent scent throw. The size of the room and the placement of the candle can also influence the scent throw.

**What are the best ways to care for a skull candle?**

To maximize the life and performance of your skull candle, trim the wick to ¼ inch before each use. Burn the candle for at least 2-3 hours during the first burn to create a full melt pool. Avoid burning the candle for more than 4 hours at a time. Keep the candle clean by removing any debris that may fall into the wax. Store the candle in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

Aside from the slight peanuty taste from the other bag they all seemed to have that generic coffee taste. I feel i could get more from their tasting notes but no matter what brew method I do I can't get the notes out of the beans

Even we made friend group that is the best one I’ve ever had, I met him during the university physical enrollment, first day we met I asked him: Yo bro where did you got those baggy jeans?, he said: i shop in Bershka and Pull&Bear
I replied: oh I do, I Know Right? The damn monthly drops sucks, and we started chatting about outfits, after the chat the uni tutors and administration responsibles called our name to sign a document and pickup the student card, I left saying: bro listen I bought a skateboard, maybe sometime we hang? , he nodded and gave me his socials, and at the next day we met at uni and chilled there for a long time, best spot was the uni library, it was calm and noiseless, the WiFi there we can say it was crappy but at least it gets the job done
That time was the best, until I didn’t have any idea how he will be transformed from a nice chill guy to monster liar, it all started when we were skating on the roads, we took a small break and dropped the bombshell: ey Abdou, im having lungs cancer, i said: no way dude, you’ll get over it, he said: i did the tests and I Don’t Know if I will have it, I replied with: it’s okay bro, just some patience and everything, dont over think it, that moment, we went to the metro to go home, at first i had my guts that he was lying but I brushed it off, days passed by we enrolled in a University club, where you can build yourself, he became another guy that moment, after, the club enrollment i went outside for a smoke, one of my friends told me that he was lying about his cancer and I said no he wasn’t cause he told me the results will come after a month or a week
1st semestre ended and 2nd semester came Along with Ramadan, Ramadan’s 2nd week he gave us the faked results saying that hes tested positive for lung cancer, everyone in the club was shocked to hear that, even me I was shocked 
I told him if I can bring him medicine, he;said with pleasure of course! , this was the biggest red flag but I brushed it off again
At that time by the evening, we went to a coffee shop, i told him that im in a group chat that is weird, he snatched my phone to put him in the group chat, that was the biggest mistake he did,
He knew there a girl, they dated for 3 weeks and broke up, all cause he saw people w different personalities and what they love, after the incident, the group chat kicked me out, for Defending him 
When Eid came and the club came back to more work, we had a UI/UX course made by the vice president of the club, 1st course didn’t showed up, 2nd same thing, third one came and justified that he had chemotherapy, the vice president knew the whole time he was faking it since the beginning, he told him: this time i let you in but next time there will be consequences, that time i brought him medicine that is so expensive to the degree I couldn’t afford it, someone from my dad’s work brought it for me
During the exams month, he met a new girl, she was kind and good, but the worst part was he started to tell her that we abuse him and everything, she gave us the look of jerks but we didn’t care, until the plow twist comes here and everything started here, he lied to her that he drives an Maybach and he gets bullied by his parents, that everyone hates him, that he has stage 3 cancer
She was so naive to the degree when he stole from his father 10mdzd, she gave him 6k to return them and pay them back anytime,
When she found out that he was lying and after some investigations, she forced him to give back the 6k she borrowed him, that day i did deeper investigations, and found that it’s true he was lying, a friend she knows his ex told me that he faked it too at her and her friends, after more investigations i came to a result that he was faking it, until the next bombshell came, 
I met a girl online we chatted and everything, she asked about my day I told her that it went bad due to my friend faking cancer, she said: Ayo you talking about Mohammed?. I said yes, she told me everything what he did to her, he kept multiple times asking her out, she refused, more over she sent a snap of her wearing a skirt, he complimented her in an uncomfortable way then asked her if she ever got raped when she was young, he heard about me telling the truth, he kept threatening me with death 
Little did he know i own a rifle if he approached me, I’ll shoot him I Don’t Care, hes dead to me already after doing creepy stuff like that, just to talk to some whores
that bullshit made my blood boiling and gave me the nerve to kill him, until now nothing happened but im planning for a revenge soon, I’ll keep you guy all updated about the revenge im preparing.

After seducing my husband, Brent Westwood, for three years and still being left untouched, I finally made up my mind—I was going to divorce him.

From the moment I saw him at that Westwood gala—silent, cold, untouchable—I was hooked. I tried everything to melt the ice: silk dresses, soft music, late-night talks, even love. But Brent gave me nothing, and not once did he come to our bedroom.

Then one night, I broke his only rule. I opened the locked door in the west wing—and found him there.

Shirt half open. Pants undone. One hand moving. The other holding a photograph.

Celeste. His stepsister.

He whispered her name like a secret, like a sin he didn’t want to stop.

That was the moment I died inside—and the moment I stopped begging because it was his time now to beg me to love him again.

I leaned back on the velvet chair in our bedroom, phone pressed to my ear. My voice was calm, but inside, I was shaking. Not with fear. With relief.

""I'm divorcing him,"" I said flatly. ""I'll come home soon.""

On the other end, my brother’s laugh rang loud and sharp. “About time, Layla. Come to Switzerland. I’ve already lined up a bunch of guys for you. Real men. Not like that emotionally-constipated mannequin you married.”

“Lucas…” I sighed.

“I warned you from the start,” he said, ignoring me. “You can’t tame someone like Brent. He’d rather whisper sweet nothings to a wall than touch a woman. You deserve better. Always have.”

“I thought I could make him fall for me,” I murmured. “I was wrong.”

I hung up before Lucas could say more. My fingers trembled as I dropped the phone onto the bed.

That’s when the memories came crashing in. The first time I saw Brent—at a Westwood gala—he stood in a corner, perfectly still, like a statue carved from marble. Men nodded with respect. Women stared with hunger. But he didn’t return anyone’s gaze. Not even mine.

My brother introduced me that night. Brent barely nodded. I smiled. He looked through me.

Still, I was drawn to him—obsessed, even. I told myself I could be the one to break through that wall of ice. So I tried. Subtle touches, long stares, late-night texts, silk dresses, fake laughter, honest affection. All of it, I gave to Brent. And I waited.

Three years later, he came to me. No ring. No speech. Just walked up one afternoon and said, “Let’s get married.”

I agreed without hesitation. I was foolish enough to think that meant he had finally fallen for me.

But after the wedding, Brent never came to our bedroom. Not once.

For months, I tried everything to pull him in—silk lingerie in his favorite color, slipping into his study at night just to bring him coffee in nothing but a robe. I memorized his schedule, cooked him breakfast every morning, massaged his shoulders after long meetings, hoping he’d just look at me the way a husband should. I’d light candles in our room, put on soft music, pretend to fall asleep in suggestive positions hoping he’d reach for me.

I even booked a weekend trip to the Maldives, thinking maybe a change of scenery would stir something in him. But he barely touched me.

He didn’t even notice when I cried in the shower, or how I stopped wearing perfume because he never cared to smell it.

Each time he walked past me like I wasn’t there, something inside me wilted a little more.

Then one night… I broke his only rule. There was a door in the west wing. Always locked. Always off-limits.

“Never go in there,” he said.

But I did. The room was dim. Cold. The faint scent of perfume clung to the air. Not mine.

That’s when I saw him.

Brent. Sitting in a velvet armchair, shirt half unbuttoned, trousers unzipped.

One hand… moving between his pants. The other held a photograph.

Celeste. His stepsister. His eyes were glassy, fixated. His lips parted in a shaky breath.

“Celeste…” he called softly, voice raw and needful.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t cry. I just stared.

It wasn’t that Brent lacked desire. He just didn’t desire me.

I left quietly and slept in the guest room that night. No tears. Just silence.

At dawn, I rose, showered, dressed, and walked out of the house. I just left to get fresh air and to prepare all the things I needed to leave him.

While I was having coffee, staring at the calm sea, he called. I didn’t answer. A few minutes later, another call. Then a text.

Brent: Where’s my navy suit? I have a meeting. You didn’t prep it. Where are you?

This time, I picked up the call.

“Layla,” Brent said curtly, already annoyed. “Where is my suit?”

I exhaled slowly. Then calmly said, “I don’t know. I don’t care.”

There was silence on the line.

“What?” he asked, voice tightening. “Are you having tantrums again? Not now! I’m busy so I need the suit—”

“I said, I don’t care. Why don’t you ask your stepsister?” I said, my tone light but deadly. “... since you only care for her.”

Then I ended the call.

Chapter 2

Brent left me missed calls and texts but I didn’t bother to read them all. I drove straight to the embassy after having my coffee. My entire family was already in Switzerland—my cousins, my aunts, and most importantly, Lucas. My brother. The only one who truly cares about me.

And me? I stayed here all this time. For Brent. For a man who wouldn’t even touch me.

I submitted the paperwork, sat through the dull conversations with officials, smiled politely, nodded when they told me processing would take a few days. Then I walked out into the California sun and didn’t feel a thing.

That night, I did something I hadn’t done in years. I called my friends.

There was an open beach bar I used to love. Loud music. Wild energy. Fire dancers and tequila shots. I used to live for it. But the moment I married Brent, I killed that part of myself.

I stopped being the life of the party and started being a wife who slept alone. Not tonight.

Two of my friends, Tasha and Myra, were down immediately.

""Layla?"" Myra blinked when I stepped out of my car. ""That dress is... see-through.""

""It’s bold,"" Tasha added, mouth open. “Are you sure about wearing that? What about your husband?”

I smiled. ""I’m tired. Of pretending. Of waiting. I want to feel alive again and I don’t care about that man anymore.""

I headed straight for the music.

The lights pulsed over my skin. I let the beat wrap around my hips and moved like I used to—uninhibited, loud, unapologetic. Men surrounded me in minutes. Hands grazed my body. Chests brushed my back. Skin against skin. I laughed like it didn’t matter. Because it didn’t.

Not anymore.

Then someone grabbed my arm.

""Layla,"" Myra hissed, dragging me toward the bar. ""You need to stop.""

""Why?"" I laughed. ""Is there a rule I don’t know about?""

She looked over my shoulder. ""Because Brent is here.""

My whole body went still.

""What?""

Tasha pointed. ""He’s been here since you walked in. Sitting there, near the bar counter. He hasn’t taken his eyes off you.""

I turned. And there he was.

Brent. Leaning back against a bench, drink untouched, face unreadable.

But he wasn’t looking at me. His gaze was locked on someone else.

I followed it. Celeste. His stepsister. She was laughing, flipping her hair, whispering in some guy’s ear. Her hand casually slipped a card into his pocket.

Brent stood up the second he saw it.

He crossed the sand in long, angry strides. His hand wrapped around Celeste’s wrist before the guy could even blink.

I moved closer, heart pounding. Close enough to hear.

“What are you doing?” Celeste snapped. “I was just talking with him and why are you even here? Did you follow me?”

Brent’s voice was low and sharp. “Who gave you permission to talk and flirt with that guy?”

Celeste yanked her arm free. “I’m not a baby. And since when do you care? You married that girl and disappeared. You didn’t check on me. You didn’t visit. You chose her, so stop pretending that you care!”

Brent’s jaw clenched. “That’s not true,” he said, his voice strained. “You think I didn’t care? I did, Celeste.”

“Stop.” Her eyes glistened, voice sharp. “If that were true, you wouldn’t have left me. You wouldn’t have married her.”

“I had to,” he replied. “I have a wife now. Things… they can’t be the same anymore.”

Celeste’s face twisted. Pain bloomed across her features, contorting into something darker, unrecognizable. “So I was right. It was all because of her. She’s the reason you stopped looking at me. She ruined everything.”

Brent took a step back. “Celeste—”

“No,” she spat. Her gaze snapped toward me. “If she didn’t exist, you’d still be mine.”

My breath caught. Something in her eyes shifted. A snap. A flicker of madness.

“She needs to die.”

Then it happened.

In one smooth, terrifying motion, Celeste lunged.

I barely saw her reach for it—a kitchen knife from the bar counter, tucked next to a basket of sliced limes and lemons.

Steel flashed.

Before I could react, before I could scream, she was on me.

The blade sank into my side. White-hot pain exploded through my body, sharp and consuming.

Murmurs echoed around us. A glass shattered. I stumbled backward, clutching the wound, blood already soaking through my dress… then everything went dark.

Chapter 3

I woke up to the sterile scent of antiseptic and the hum of machines. The ceiling above me was too white, too bright. My body ached, my side throbbed, and every breath stung.

“Layla!” Myra’s voice cracked as she leaned over me, her eyes wide and teary. “Oh my god, you’re awake—thank god. We thought we lost you.”

Tasha stood behind her, clutching a cup of hospital coffee. She looked pale. “You lost a lot of blood. The knife cut deep… but no major organs were hit. The doctors stitched you up in time.”

My head was heavy, but my mind was clear. I blinked slowly. “Where’s Brent?”

Their silence was loud. Myra looked down. Tasha shifted uncomfortably.

“Where is he?” I repeated, a little stronger this time.

Myra finally spoke. “He didn’t come.”

I stared at her. “What?”

“He… went with Celeste,” Tasha said, voice flat. “Right after you passed out. Paramedics came, took you. He stayed behind—with her.”

“Stayed?” I croaked.

“He took her home,” Myra added, anger slipping into her voice. “And we thought maybe he just needed to process or something, but then… this.”

She pulled out her phone and turned the screen to me.

It was a photo. Brent and Celeste, sitting at an outdoor restaurant. She was laughing. He was feeding her something from his plate, his hand on hers. There was a shopping bag beside her chair. Designer.

“They reconciled,” Tasha said bitterly. “Brent spoiled her like nothing happened. We saw them ourselves.”

The photo blurred as my eyes welled up. I bit the inside of my cheek hard, grounding myself. I stared at the picture again. Celeste was smiling like she hadn’t stabbed me just hours ago. Brent looked… content.

I knew what I needed to do.

“Pass me my phone,” I said.

Myra hesitated. “Layla—”

“Please.”

She handed it over.

I called the police.

I gave them my full name, the hospital address, and filed an assault case. I told them what happened—that Celeste Westwood stabbed me with a kitchen knife at the bar. That it was unprovoked. That I had witnesses. That I had nearly died.

By the time I ended the call, my hand was shaking. But my voice was steady.

Later that night, the hospital room was quiet again. Myra and Tasha had gone home to rest. Nurses came and went. I stared at the IV drip, the slow tick of saline, and the dull beep of the heart monitor.

The door creaked open.

Brent.

He stepped inside with his usual perfect posture, his face unreadable.

For one moment, one pathetic heartbeat, I hoped he’d say he was sorry. That he’d ask if I was okay. That something had changed.

He didn’t.

Instead, his jaw was tight, his voice low and controlled.

“You filed a case against Celeste?”

I blinked at him. “She stabbed me.”

“She didn’t mean it,” he said sharply. “She was drunk. She wasn’t in the right mind. You know how she is—she has a temper.”

“She stabbed me, Brent.”

He looked at me like I was the problem. “You’re alive. You weren’t critically hurt. It could’ve been worse.”

I laughed, a bitter, strained sound. “That’s your response? I could’ve died.”

“She didn’t want to kill you,” he snapped. “She was upset.”

My body stiffened. “I am your wife.”

He exhaled slowly. “Even if you file a case, it won’t go anywhere. You know who our family is. I already grounded her. Took her cards. She won’t be going out for a while.”

“A credit card is not a punishment for attempted murder,” I spat.

Brent ran a hand through his hair. “Layla, don’t make this harder than it is. You need to rest. Heal.”

I tried to speak again, but he cut me off.

“I’m going abroad,” he said, glancing at his watch. “I’ll be gone for a few days. When I get back, I’ll bring you something. A gift. You’ll feel better.”

Then he turned and walked out.

Just like that.

He never asked how I felt. Never said sorry. Never cared.

I lay in that cold hospital bed, tears slipping silently down my cheeks. There was no warmth left. No hope.

Only the sharp, painful clarity that Brent Westwood never loved me—and never would.

Chapter 4

I spent the next few days in the hospital, hooked up to wires and machines that beeped at regular intervals. I stared at the ceiling for hours. Blank. Numb. But when I couldn’t take the silence anymore, I reached for my phone.

Notifications blinked to life. Celeste had posted.

Her Instagram was flooded—photos of luxury shopping bags, reels of her sipping champagne on a private jet. The caption: “Flying out for something special #RoyalAuction #PrincessDiana”

I blinked, stunned. The next video showed her standing in front of a glass case, dramatically clutching her chest as an auctioneer described a brooch once worn by Princess Diana.

Behind her? Brent. I watched the clip again. Brent. With Celeste. At a royal auction. Smiling. Whispering something that made her laugh like they were the only people in the world.

Meanwhile, I was lying in a hospital bed with stitches down my side and a pulse monitor beeping beside me like a ticking reminder of everything I had lost.

Another post. This time, a photo of the two of them holding hands—not romantically, but intimate nonetheless. The caption burned.

“My brother is the kindest man alive. Some people could never understand our bond. You protect me. Always. #Grateful #FamilyFirst”

My jaw tightened. I had chosen Brent over everything—my freedom, my friends, even myself. I had stayed loyal. Patient. Hopeful.

And now? He was giving all of himself to Celeste, while I rotted in silence.

Still, I didn’t cry. I wouldn’t give them that.

I only needed my visa. Once it came through, I’d be gone. Out of this marriage. Out of their twisted lives.

A few days later, I was discharged.

To my surprise, Brent picked me up.

Celeste was already in the passenger seat, sunglasses on, voice loud and chipper. “Oh my god, Layla, you should’ve seen it. The auction was to die for. There were so many exclusive pieces. But that brooch—ugh, perfection. Brent almost got into a bidding war just for me.”

My stomach twisted. Brent handed me a small plastic bag as I slid into the passenger seat.

Inside was a keychain. Cheap. Souvenir-type. One of those airport ones with ‘Zurich’ written across a tin plate.

“I thought you liked collecting these,” he said without looking at me.

I stared at it. He had just bought Celeste an antique brooch worth tens of thousands. And I got… a keychain.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t even fake a smile.

The rest of the ride was quiet—except for Celeste, who kept chattering about her plans to redesign Diana’s gown for her final school project. “Brent’s going to help me get a studio,” she added smugly. “Isn’t that sweet?”

When we pulled into the driveway, Brent turned to me casually. “Celeste will be staying with us for a few days.”

I said nothing. Just got out of the car and walked straight to my room.

The second the door closed, I collapsed on the bed and shut my eyes. I didn’t want to feel. I just wanted sleep. But when I woke up a few hours later, something felt… off.

My head was lighter. My scalp was cold. I bolted to the mirror—and screamed.

My hair. My long, dark, carefully grown hair… was gone. Chopped in jagged pieces. Uneven. Butchered.

Heart pounding, I stumbled out of my room, down the stairs, searching for answers. And there she was.

Celeste, in the living room, surrounded by strands of hair—my hair—draped over mannequin heads.

She was stitching them into a wig.

“For school,” she said cheerfully, barely glancing up. “Real hair wigs are expensive. Thought I’d try something organic. Yours is perfect—so thick, so glossy.”

I snapped. The rage I’d buried all this time surged to the surface like a tidal wave. I marched forward and slapped her across the face.

Chapter 5

Her hand flew to her cheek, her eyes wide with shock—and then, like a mask peeling off, her expression shifted into something darker.

“Brent has never laid a hand on me,” she whispered. “I’ve been protected all my life. No one touches me. How dare you!”

She stepped back, heels clicking against the marble. Then, slowly and deliberately, she pulled out her phone.

“I’m gonna make you pay for it.”

Before I could process her words, the front doors opened. Two massive bodyguards in black suits stepped inside. I didn’t even know Brent kept them stationed at the house.

She ordered, “Hold her.”

“What—wait, stop!” I backed up, but the guards closed in fast. One grabbed my left arm. The other snatched my right. Their grips were tight, brutal, unyielding. I couldn’t move. “I am Brent’s wife! You don’t dare hurt me!”

Celeste laughed. “I’m his stepsister. And I’m pretty sure I’m more valuable than you are!”

The bodyguard hesitated a bit but when they followed Celeste's order, I knew that even the bodyguards knew that Celeste was more important than me.

Celeste stood in front of me now, arms crossed, her lip curled in disgust. “You thought one slap would settle things?” she said, tilting her head. “You humiliated me.”

Her hand shot out. Slap. The impact exploded across my cheek, sending a jolt of heat and pain through my skull. My head snapped to the side.

Slap. The other cheek this time. My jaw cracked. My ears rang.

She hit again. And again.

Her palm kept flying, switching sides, the sound of flesh meeting flesh echoing like thunderstorm. I lost count quickly. My skin burned. Then it broke. Blood trickled down my chin, and tears sprang to my eyes—not from emotion, but from sheer, sharp pain.

“Still think you're better than me?” she hissed between strikes. “Still think you can walk around like this is your house? You’re nothing, Layla. You were always nothing.”

My knees gave out, but the guards held me upright, forcing me to take it all.

My vision blurred, dark around the edges. Her face became a smear of rage, her voice a buzzing hum behind the sound of my own heartbeat pounding in my ears.

By the time she stepped back, I was breathless and broken. My face throbbed like fire. My lips were split, swelling already.

She turned to the guards and casually asked, “How many?”

“One hundred, Miss Westwood,” one of them said without hesitation.

She smirked. “Good. That’s what happens when you lay a finger on me. No one touches me.”

I was still wheezing, chest rising and falling as I fought for air, when the door behind us opened again.

Brent. He stepped in and paused.

Took in the scene. Me—bloodied, restrained. Celeste—calm, unbothered.

His face didn’t change.

“What’s going on?” he asked.

I could barely get the words out. “She cut my hair,” I managed, voice raspy. “Then she ordered them to hold me… and she slapped me. A hundred times. Ask them.”

Celeste didn’t flinch. “She hit me first,” she said with a shrug. “Besides—it’s just hair.”

I stared at him, desperate for anything. A sliver of concern. An ounce of protection. Something.

“She beat me, Brent. You’re really going to act like that’s nothing?”

He walked over, knelt slightly, and gently wiped a smear of blood off my chin with his sleeve like I was a child with jelly on my face.

“I’ll bring you to the hospital,” he said softly. “Don’t worry about it.”

I pulled away. “No. Don’t bother.”

“Layla—”

“I said no.” My voice didn’t crack this time. “I’ll go alone. You don’t care, so don’t bother.”

I turned, stumbling as I pulled free from the guards. No one moved. No one tried to stop me. My face burned, my body ached, and the taste of blood still coated my mouth.

I was halfway to the door when I heard his footsteps behind me.

For a second, I thought—maybe he’ll follow me.

Maybe he’d changed his mind.

Then Celeste’s voice cut through the hallway like a blade. “Brent,” she whined, cradling her hand. “My palm hurts. I think I bruised it. I slapped her too hard…”

I paused. My breath caught.

Brent didn’t even hesitate.

I glanced over my shoulder in time to see him walking toward her. He took her hand gently, lifted it to his lips, and kissed the center of her palm.

And I was again forgotten so I just walked outside. I flagged a taxi with a shaky hand, the taste of blood still in my mouth.

When I got in, the driver asked, “Hospital?”

I shook my head. “No,” I croaked. “Take me here instead.” I gave him Myra’s address.

Myra opened the door less than ten minutes later.

She winced. “Layla? What the heck—what happened to your face?!”

I didn’t explain. I didn’t have the strength. I dropped my bag inside the entryway and whispered, “Can I stay? Just until my visa arrives.”

She didn’t say a word. Just pulled me into a tight hug and let me cry against her shoulder.

The next few days blurred. Ice packs pressed to my cheeks. Warm soup. Quiet rooms. The hum of the news playing softly in the background while I stared at the wall.

I didn’t check my phone. I didn’t want to see more pictures of Brent and Celeste acting like everything was perfect. Like I hadn’t bled on their polished floors.

Then one day, a message buzzed in.

Brent: Why aren’t you at the hospital? I told you to go. Where are you?

I stared at the text. The audacity. Like I was just a name on his to-do list.

No anger. No apology. Just a reminder.

I didn’t reply. I blocked his number instead.

That same afternoon, I zipped up my bag. Checked my passport. Then I headed to the airport.

When the plane took off, I didn’t look back.

I was done breaking for people who only knew how to shatter me.

And this time—I wouldn’t be the one left behind.

Before the current situation, I had expressed some dislike toward Quinn and Kaitlyn to the other members. Kaitlyn isn’t great at keeping promises or being punctual, while Quinn can be very unserious at times. It had been bothering me for a while, so I privately talked to the other two members to see if they felt the same.

I first asked Irene, who agreed that she disliked them. Then I asked Sakura, who said she didn’t like some aspects of them but otherwise thought they were fine. Afterward, I told Sakura not to tell anyone about our conversation.

Some time later, Sakura started ignoring me, she wouldn’t message me first and began going out with Kaitlyn all the time. I felt upset, so I talked to Irene about it.

A couple of months later, I found out that Sakura had told Kaitlyn about our conversation, even though I had specifically asked her not to. I tried to clear it up by saying I just didn’t consider Kaitlyn a close friend. But Kaitlyn and Sakura ended up distancing themselves from us anyway.

Eventually, Kaitlyn came to me and asked about the situation. She said Sakura told her I was a bad person. I ended up telling her that Sakura doesn’t like her.

Kaitlyn and I confronted Sakura, but she only admitted to telling Kaitlyn about the conversation, not about calling me a bad person. Apparently, there was a third person who spread all those rumours. Kaitlyn agreed to this, but I still don’t know what to believe.

The annoying thing is, Sakura literally has everything going for her. Everyone is obsessed with her, she’s smart, pretty, stylish, talented, good at games, and does competitive badminton, volleyball, and ice skating. She’s good at everything. She also acts really nice, so everyone likes her, but I don’t believe it. She’s also really secretive and never shares anything with us.

Sakura has invited me to coffee to “prevent any misconceptions.” Before I go, AITAH? Should I apologize, or is it really her fault?",0,1750918803.0,AITAH,4,0.5,False

First, maybe it will be useful for someone else.  
Second, I hope it’s therapeutic for me to write it down. I'm sorry it's long, if it's not for you I understand. Let me save you some time and tell you this wasn’t a dramatic horror story. But it was my story. And it absolutely shook me.

  
Even writing it now, I’m still shaking. I have zero people to talk to about this and I’ve been struggling emotionally.

# Before the Procedure

It was a bilateral (something or other) — single small incision with cauterisation.

I was nervous, but this was my bright idea. I asked my doctor and he said it didn’t really matter where I went. I ended up choosing a large chain because their website was easy. They had average reviews — 3 stars — and one bad one stuck with me: a guy said he had to be placed in a medical coma due to infection. That freaked me out, but I figured online reviews always skew toward the worst experiences as outliers.

This story was on my mind leading up to it the months ahead. Barely minutes went by without me dreading the upcoming op. I asked everyone for advice. During the pre-op phone consult, the doctor said, *""It’s no worse than the dentist.""*

My dad told me he laughed the whole way through his — kind of funny — he mentioned watching the bombing of Iraq on the TV during the procedure. I ended up watching bombing of Iran during mine. Generational symmetry, I guess.

Reddit and other forums reassured me: *“A bit of pain from the injection, a bit of small talk, then snip-snip and you’re done.”*

# The Day Of

My appointment was booked for 10am at a nearby hospital. I took three days off work to reward myself and planned to sleep in. But the day before, they called and moved it to 7:45am — meaning a 5:30 wake-up, I was furious and did not plan for this. I got zero sleep. Tossing and turning, with a storm outside, and my 2 kids and dog waking me up multiple times.

I arrived early, expecting to be in and out. Instead, I was kept waiting over four hours. No updates. I kept assuming it was just minutes away. I should have asked about this.

I had a light breakfast, expecting it to be quick — coffee, protein shake, a bit of oatmeal — but by the time it actually happened, I was starving and lightheaded. I had also accidentally made my coffee too strong. I spent the whole wait **pissing constantly and shaking** from the caffeine.

The process was repetitive — endless paperwork and multiple people asking me the same questions. Every time I got up to piss, I thought maybe the surgeon was on the way. I had to wear one of those awful gowns, naked underneath, my dick in the thin fabric and bare ass exposed in a busy hospital. Utterly degrading having to walk back and forth.

# A Few Tips I Wish I Knew:

1. **Skip the coffee**. Just take a sip of water before you leave. You don’t want to be anxious and constantly needing the bathroom.
2. **If the hospital offers food, say yes**. I kept thinking, “Any minute now,” so I politely declined. Big mistake.
3. **Avoid spicy food the night before**. I had two spicy burritos — did not mix well with coffee and nerves.
4. **Ask for wait-time updates**. Assume you’ll be there all day. Bring a full phone charge, headphones, podcasts, or a movie and dive in deep.

# The Procedure

Eventually the surgeon showed up — a young guy, probably late 20s. I was a wreck at this point: exhausted, starving, shaking, heavy head in hands. But I was stoked it was finally happening.

I didn’t expect to be led into a full-on operating room with two female nurses. I had assumed it would be something more casual — like a chair and a quick in-and-out. This was ER type shit, with stuff beeping and crazy lights. I should have asked ahead of time.

I tried to stay brave. Some small talk, smiles, jokes. I lay down and they applied an orange antiseptic across me, while exposing my flaccid, terrified, cold, wet penis to the ladies. I was mentally prepared for that — it sucked, but I knew it was coming.

What I *wasn’t* prepared for: during my “final hurrah” the night before, I’d apparently caused some... abrasions. Very obviously self-inflicted. In hindsight, that was a humiliating discovery.

Then the surgeon began “examining me” — which apparently meant cupping, poking and firmly crushing each of my testicles with his hands. It was worse than being kicked. I groaned out loud. I was still being brave.

Then came the injection. I welcomed it — hoping it would dull the pain and nausea, and a sign that the worst was over.

But what came next...

It felt like a steel anvil was being forced deep into my balls, and then this horrible sensation started to spread outward — like a pressure wave tunnelling through my guts, down my legs, my bones, into my left stomach. A growing pressure of ice cold lava in my arteries .

I don’t know if it was more anaesthetic going in, maybe they tugged on my vas to test the numbing — or if that was the first cut. I certainly wasn’t watching. But it was the worst thing I’ve ever felt in my life. 

I read one personal story mention something very similar, I just didn't expect it to happen to me. He said it felt like being kicked in the balls but 100x worse, for me this explanation didn't do it justice. 

I broke. I begged for mercy. I cried. I tried to remain still and breath deeply as I shook uncontrollably. The nurse kindly rubbed my quickly sweating forehead as I clenched my eyes until I saw white. In that moment I loved that underpaid stranger more than my mother.

I was told later that that everyone's anatomy is different — some people have more sensitive nerve clusters and the pain 'refers up'. I don't know if the surgeon messed up somehow, if I just needed more anaesthetic or it needed more time to kick in. I'd love to hear theories.

They gave me more anaesthetic, and after 30 seconds it started working. The rest of the procedure — about 10 minutes — was very uncomfortable, very awful but not painful. But I was already a complete mess from the earlier experience.

# Aftermath

I tried to talk and joke, I was thrilled it was over and assured everything went great, but they said I did not look good so they insisted I use a wheelchair, which I still refused. My skin was pale, eyes black, blood pressure was 180/90. In recovery, I asked for privacy — and once alone, I quietly sobbed.

I felt like I had just paid, politely waited and volunteered to be butchered. Humiliated. Tortured. I thought the benefit of no more condoms felt incredibly trivial compared to what I’d just gone through.

The staff were lovely. The surgeon seemed skilled. But emotionally, I was shattered. I had expected to walk through it a stoic. Instead, I walked away feeling broken. Albeit relieved it was over.

# Recovery

When I finally had the courage to inspect my mangled scrotum I was expecting something out of Platoon or Private Ryan, but I had no swelling, bruising, or bleeding. Just a tiny waterproof bandage, about the size of a papercut band-aid. My balls looked normal — just retracted and shrivelled. But the internal nausea was horrible. Like food poisoning. 

Pain meds didn’t help much. I was expecting a dull pain, but it wasn’t exactly pain — more like a blender running inside my guts and an uneasiness. I shook all day. It was impossible to get comfortable, it sucked but it was bearable.

I had a huge sleep that night and unexpectedly the next day I woke up feeling fine, almost like nothing had happened.

# Final Thoughts

If I had to do it again, I’d absolutely choose general anaesthesia or sedation. Yes, it costs more. Yes, it adds risk. But the mental toll wasn’t worth it for me.

Hospitals are impersonal, dehumanizing. If you’re scared or emotional like me, don't tough it out — be honest about your anxiety and ask about sedation or alternatives.  
I consider myself a tough guy, but something about the balls must have been a trigger for me.

There were other men waiting in the hospital with me, and while I suspect they were also acting brave, I sensed a genuine joviality in them that I did not have. A man has to know his limitations.

The procedure itself went perfectly. The surgeon did his job well. But I fucking hated every moment of it. I would prefer to know something is going to absolutely suck and be pleasantly surprised if it doesn't. Rather than the vice versa I experienced.

Shave several times in the days leading up to it, so you don't have a huge job the day of.

Definitely do take time off work. 

I didn’t purposely choose the cheapest option — but it was cheap.  
$500 hospital, $500 procedure. $100 out of pocket with my healthcare plan. I’d strongly recommend researching other clinics and just choosing the most expensive one.

  
If you're considering a vasectomy, I hope my story gives you a fuller picture — not to scare you, but to prepare you better than I was. I do feel a lot better having shared this.
