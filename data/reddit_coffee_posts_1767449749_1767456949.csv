1q2yi7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstantCoffee/comments/1q2yi7e/coffee_powder_prepared_fresh_only_after_you_place/,Coffee Powder Prepared fresh only after you place your order in one hour,"Hi coffee lovers ☕

We’re exploring the idea of coffee that’s **prepared fresh only after you place your order** — not stored for weeks, and with **no preservatives added**.

The goal is better **freshness, stronger aroma, and enhanced taste in every sip**.  
This would likely come at a **premium price (around 2× regular packaged coffee)**.

We’re curious:

* Would this level of freshness and taste improvement be worth paying extra for?
* Is this something you’d enjoy **every day**, or only occasionally?
* What kind of customization would matter most to you (coffee–chicory ratios, roast level, grind size, etc.)?

Honest feedback—positive or critical—is really appreciated 🙏

I am curious if others have any other species of succulents or others to suggest for beginners? The most resilient I have tested so far (a bit atypical species) are jade, stonecrop, & holiday cacti.

I just wanted to know if anyone has been in a similar situation to me or if they have any advice for me.



So, I (20F) was diagnosed with OAB a few years ago. My doctor prescribed Betmiga 50mg and Solinco 10mg. During the two years I took them, I went from going to the bathroom over 20 times a day to going to the bathroom only 9 times a day, which was a huge improvement (although there were often days when, despite taking the medication, I still had severe symptoms, lol). My urologist, seeing the improvement, recommended I stop taking the medication to see how my body would react. And so I did, and within a month of stopping the medication, I went from going to the bathroom 9 times a day to going to the bathroom almost 20 times a day. After consulting with my doctor, I was offered the option of having an Interstim implant. I agreed. I completed the trial period, and it was permanently implanted. Compared to taking the medication, the neurostimulator really made me feel like I was back to normal (I was going to the bathroom 8-9 times a day, with no bad days). 



Unfortunately, after two months of using Interstim, I noticed that it gradually became less effective than it was at the beginning. I turned the device off for extended periods, switched to different programs, and even had new programs added by the Interstim representative, but unfortunately, nothing changed. Besides gradually getting worse, my bladder pressure/feeling of not emptying after urinating increased (even though it is empty, as confirmed by doctors themselves), which led to me spending very long periods of time on the toilet (currently, I can sit for over 1.30 hours and still feel like I need to pee. I don't know if this is significant, but I constantly have to apply pressure to my bladder and even manage to pee, which is strange because I'm supposed to have an empty bladder). After reporting the problem to my urologist, I went back on medication (Betmiga and Solinco) and even had a urodynamic test, which showed that my bladder had shrunk (it has a capacity of 150ml, and the urge to go to the toilet starts at 30ml). Since starting to take medication again, there was a A minor change after a while, but for unknown reasons, the medication stopped being effective.



At this point, neither Intersim nor the medication are working for me, and it's getting worse from week to week, my doctors don't know why it doesn't work, and it's driving me crazy. As I mentioned, my bladder urges have become so intense that I'm spending a lot of time on the toilet, and I honestly don't know what I can do to reduce them. Has anyone been in a similar situation and knows what might have caused the lack of results from the medication and Intersim? Or does anyone know what I can do to even slightly reduce my symptoms?



(I would also like to mention that I don't drink coffee or alcohol. I went to a physiotherapist for my pelvic floor, but there were no visible effects after several months of use. I started doing exercises for them again over a month ago, but I still don't see any effects or feel any relief. I can't take other medications because the ones I'm currently taking are the strongest. I'll have Botox, but that won't happen for a few months. I had an MRI, which showed something, and I'm supposed to go to a neurologist to see if that's the cause of my illness, although I doubt it is.

Unfortunately, while playing BF6 without undervolting my GPU, the game would sometimes suffer a transient power spike ( my most likely suspicioun, as the game runs fine with a GPU undervolt ) which could case my PSU to shut the PC down. When this happens, you can't do anything but hold the power button for a forceful PC shutdown.

This resulted in me pressing the button a little too hard, which broke it in, jammed the plastic down onto the railing where the switch is, and the button is broken.

Extremely important info: To fix this; i turned my PC on via the power switch pins on the motherboard, by connecting them via screwdriver. However, the pins were initially hidden by the front-panel connector cable, which had pins like power\_sw ( 2 pins ), power\_led, hd\_led etc:

\-  I unplugged all 6 of those pins, turned my PC on via screwdriver, went into BIOS and enabled the ""turn on after power restored setting"". So now when i turn my pc off, i just switch the power off, and when i turn the switch back on, PC starts up, everything works fine.

Untill yesterday, and today when my PC would randomly instantly shutdown and re-boot, as if something was touching the power switch pins or the reset pins. No idea how, as i remove the cable which connected them to the front buttons. Here's Windows event log viewer of it happening twice today: [https://imgur.com/a/UNguS91](https://imgur.com/a/UNguS91)

You can see the 2 critical kernel level errors about the PC ""suddenly losing power"". This happened once yesterday while i was playing KCD2. At first i thought it was the game heating up my CPU or something so i reduced the settings. But it's clearly not it, as it happened today while i was out drinking coffee:

\- Which had me thinking, my sleep / monitor off / and hibernate are set to kick in after 35 mins of inactivity. Could this be caused by hibernation or something?

In any case, the only thing i did today was open up my pc, tape off the heads of the old plastic front-panel connector with electrical tape which i disconnected just to make sure it's not touching anything on the motherboard.

What do i do if a random reboot happens again? What else do i do and check? I'm so confused as my front-panel cable which connected the button and reset button to the motherboard are disconnected, i'm not using them, so how the hell is my pc randomly rebooting?

I'll provide additional screenshots of the motherboard and the cable i disconnected, and the broken railing under the front-panel where the plastic of the button went:

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

Maybe you all need the tourism money but no one was gruff except one dude at an airport coffee shop, everyone was warm, even those who didn't speak English tried to help. The last time I saw this was in Japan. 

I've a few questions and please understand my context as an Indian who identifies as a left wing liberal. We don't have a socialist government or parties except in two states of Kerala and West Bengal and the former exceeds per capita income, cleanliness and literacy on all counts than other states. Any form of socialism is despised and looked down upon and what we have is a democracy that isn't exactly working for the masses. The standard of living is very low, universal healthcare doesn't exist in a functional manner and free education is only for girls and even after 78 years, we don't have hundred percent electricity or literacy. What's funny is that majority of news outlets are now owned by pro-goverment corporates. So it's not like we have free media. My feeling is that Vietnam was badgered by war and yet you're miles ahead of us.

And I wish more people would visit and see that India is ravaged by corruption and instead of religion and capitalism, MAYBE giving socialism a chance would be good. The locals and guides I interacted with loved the government and Ho Chi Minh.

Apart from this, stray questions: 

- why does marou chocolate slap so hard? How do we destroy toblerone with it?
- why do only adults are seen playing hackysack/soccer with that keychain thing and never kids?
- why are school hours so long? I didn't see any kids playing ever
- why is the last two years of school so hard/the last exam so important? Is it that if you do bad in it, your entire career Goes South? 
- how high or low is the corruption there?

1q2y4v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1q2y4v3/why_just_be_consistent_is_terrible_advice_the/,"Why ""Just Be Consistent"" Is Terrible Advice: The Psychology That Actually WORKS","Everyone tells you to ""just be consistent"" like it's some magic spell. Wake up at 5am. Hit the gym. Journal daily. Meal prep on Sundays. But here's what nobody mentions: consistency without strategy is just exhausting yourself in the wrong direction.



I spent months being ""consistent"" with habits that drained me, wondering why I felt burned out instead of better. Then I dove deep into behavioral psychology research, listened to countless hours of James Clear and BJ Fogg talking about habit formation, and realized the whole conversation around consistency is fundamentally broken.



The real issue? We're taught that willpower and discipline are enough. They're not. Your brain isn't wired to suddenly become a different person overnight. There are actual neurological reasons why you fail, and once you understand them, you can work WITH your biology instead of it.



Here's what actually works:



 Start absurdly small, like embarrassingly small. BJ Fogg's research at Stanford shows that tiny habits create lasting change because they don't trigger resistance. Want to read more? Start with ONE page. Not a chapter. One page. Your brain won't fight something that takes 30 seconds. I started with literally opening a book each night. That's it. Six months later I'm reading 2-3 books monthly because the behavior became automatic. The book Atomic Habits by James Clear (sold over 15 million copies, this guy literally changed how we think about behavior change) breaks this down brilliantly. He shows how 1% improvements compound into massive results. Not through motivation, but through systems. The chapter on habit stacking alone will rewire how you approach your entire day. Best behavior change book I've ever read, no contest.



 Anchor new habits to existing ones. Your brain already has established neural pathways. Use them. I started doing pushups while my coffee brewed because that routine already existed. The podcast Huberman Lab did an incredible episode on dopamine and motivation that explains why this works neurologically. Andrew Huberman is a Stanford neuroscientist who makes complex brain science actually digestible. He talks about how our reward systems get hijacked and how to reclaim them. The dopamine episode specifically will make you rethink everything about motivation.



 Track behavior, not outcomes. This shift is HUGE. Don't track ""lost 5 pounds"" or ""read 20 pages"". Track ""went to gym"" or ""opened book"". The app Finch is insanely good for this. It's a self-care pet app where you complete daily goals to take care of a little bird. Sounds childish but the gamification actually works because it focuses on showing up, not perfecting. Your brain gets the dopamine hit from the check mark, not from some distant goal.



Another one worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans around your specific goals. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, it transforms knowledge sources into customized podcasts you can adjust for length and depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The adaptive plan feature is particularly useful because it structures learning based on your unique challenges and keeps evolving as you progress. Plus there's a virtual coach you can chat with for recommendations or to work through specific struggles.



 Build in failure days. This sounds counterintuitive but hear me out. Research shows that people who expect perfect consistency quit faster. I have ""minimum viable"" versions of every habit. Can't do a full workout? Ten squats counts. Too tired to journal? Three bullet points about my day. The book Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg (he runs the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford and has spent 20+ years studying this) teaches you how to celebrate tiny wins and why that matters more than you think. He literally shows you how to rewire your brain's reward system. This book made me realize I'd been approaching habits completely backwards my entire life.



 Use implementation intentions. Fancy term for ""if-then"" planning. ""If it's 7am, then I put on workout clothes."" Research by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer shows this doubles your success rate because you remove decision fatigue. Your brain doesn't have to choose in the moment when it's tired or stressed.



 Create environmental cues. Your environment is stronger than your willpower. I put my running shoes by my bed. Books on my pillow. Healthy snacks at eye level. The YouTube channel HealthyGamerGG (run by Dr. K, a Harvard psychiatrist who specialized in addiction) has brilliant content on how your environment literally shapes your neural patterns. His videos on gaming addiction apply to any compulsive behavior, and he breaks down the neuroscience of why changing your space changes your brain.



The truth is, you're not failing because you lack discipline. You're failing because you're using a broken system. Your brain has built-in mechanisms that resist sudden change. It's literally trying to protect you from wasting energy on behaviors that might not matter for survival.



But once you understand the science, you can hack those mechanisms. Small wins create neural pathways. Those pathways become automatic. Automaticity becomes identity. That's not inspiration talk, that's neuroscience.



Stop forcing consistency through pure willpower. Start building systems your brain actually wants to follow.",1,1767455971.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

1q2y3cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersuasionExperts/comments/1q2y3cw/the_cia_manual_to_manipulate_anyone/,The CIA Manual to Manipulate Anyone,"Every country worth their salt has spies.

These spies are used to steal technology or finance secrets, and to predict what their enemies are going to do.

But every country also has counter-intelligence. Their job is to hunt down those spies and neutralize them - Meaning you throw them in prison, send them to meet their maker, or my favorite... convince them to betray their own country.

Now, how do you do that? Do you blackmail them? Or use some secret brainwashing method developed in a CIA black site.

Well, no. (as far as the general public knows)

You buy them a coffee.

You talk about family, stress, and the everyday bs. 

The more they hang out with you, the more likely you are to earn their trust and loyalty.

And that’s how you can turn a stranger or even an enemy into an ally.

It sounds simple, but it’s not easy.

Here’s how you actually do it.

**1. Deactivate the Alarm**

When dealing with people, we are taught to be bold, to act with confidence and enthusiasm.

And that’s good advice in most cases, but it might backfire when you’re dealing with strangers or people who are suspicious of you.

Because when you approach a stranger, they are making a simple calculation in their mind... Is this person dangerous? Do they want something from me? How long am I going to be stuck here?

If you come in strong, then you validate those concerns, and they’ll be less likely to trust you.

That’s why when a special agent approaches a foreign spy or a potential crime informant, they’re restrained. You mention indirectly how long it’s going to take; maintain open body language; You don't act as if you know them; and you don’t ask for favors (even small ones) until you have built a strong rapport with them.

Another important thing is to be predictable during the interaction. This means if they are cold, you don't overcompensate by being extra nice. Or if they’re rude, you don’t argue with them. 

So you try to be consistent with your emotions.

This was the key to handling Oleg Gordievsky, a high-ranking KGB officer who became one of the most valuable assets for British intelligence. When asked why he trusted MI6 over his own people, he was like, “They were **boringly consistent.”**

He added that the KGB relies on a volatile approach. If you're dealing with them, they'll make you feel like the most important person in the world, then they'll shift to treating you like a servant or a criminal.

They will also guilt-trip you and constantly judge you for your beliefs.

Basically, they’re like a toxic partner.

But this emotional volatility keeps you on your toes. You don't know if they're going to hug you or threaten your family. You're always on high alert.

That's what Gordievsky meant by boringly consistent. When he interacted with the British agents, he knew they wouldn't judge him or suddenly turn on him. He felt safe enough to give them the truth.

**2. Suspend Your Ego**

When people express opinions or beliefs we disagree with, we instinctively try to correct them. This sends the message that we don’t have a good perception of them, and no matter how polite we are, they’ll sense they’re being judged and close off.

But if you want people to stay loyal to you for a long time, you need to stop trying to change who they are.

Your only goal is to understand who they *believe* they are. This doesn’t mean to agree with those beliefs. You are simply acknowledging their point of view.

A perfect example is Dmitri Polyakov, a Soviet General and one of the most important double agents in US history.

When the CIA approached him, they had an ordinary conversation where he talked more than they did.

Through those conversations, they understood that in his mind, he was a Soviet patriot.

But he was cooperating with the Americans because he was deeply disappointed by the party's corruption. He believed that by helping the Americans, he was actually saving his country from the people destroying it from within.

So the US agents never attacked or attempted to change his identity or to convince him to embrace Western values. 

They always worked within his moral framework.

What does this mean for you?

In everyday life, you let someone explain their position without interrupting it with your own.

You don't rush to show where you disagree. You don't try to guide them toward a ""better"" conclusion. 

You simply focus on understanding how their story fits together - what they value, what they hate, and what they believe is justified.

**3. The MICE Framework**

Every person you meet, whether they're a foreign spy, a businessperson, a leader of a country, or your average Joe, is driven by one of these 4 levers. Once you understand them, you'll know how to reach them.

The first lever is, surprise surprise… **money**.

It is the most common, but also the weakest. In the sense that if you bond with someone over money, you have a transaction, not a relationship. They'll abandon or betray you once the financial interest is over.

In addition, high-ranking officials sometimes have a significant weakness... They might be addicted to alcohol, gambling, drugs, or a luxurious lifestyle. This makes them a huge liability because they could be recruited by organized crime or an enemy country.

For example, Charles McGonigal was the former Special Agent in Charge of Counterintelligence for the FBI in New York. It is one of the highest positions you can hold as an agent.

But more than his title, he loved the paper. So he ended up taking secret payments from a Russian oligarch.

The second lever is **Ideology** \- When you’re aligned with someone’s beliefs or values, you create a powerful bond.

And this brings us back to Dmitri Polyakov.

During the conversation, the agent noticed that he spoke passionately about Russian history but hated the leadership. They had also noticed that, despite being a Major General, he lived a modest life.

To truly confirm he was an ideologue, the CIA offered him money for the information. But he refused because it clearly contradicts his identity. It would mean that he’s not doing it for the country… He’s in it for the money.

Now, people like him are rare. What's more common in this category are people who hate the party and need the money. We have a mix of two levers.

This is why Mossad has had and will have success in recruiting spies in countries like Iran and Palestine. Plenty of people despise those regimes and are willing to do anything to hurt them.

If Maduro is really in the hands of Americans, it’s clear that the CIA has had spies in his inner circle.

Next we have **coercion,** or to put it another way, blackmail.

In the movies, spies seem to love it. But in reality, they try to avoid it because it breeds hatred. If I have to force you to help me, I have to watch my back every second.

The final lever is **the Ego.**

These people will usually tell themselves three narratives.

First, you have *the underappreciated genius* narrative\*.\* They believe they're better than the rest, but they’re not getting the respect and recognition they think they deserve.

To influence them, you tell them they're unjustly ignored. You frame yourself as the only person who truly sees their value.

Second, you have *the insider.* These people love the status of a kingmaker - kinda like McGonigal. To influence them, give them exclusive access or make them feel like a decision-maker.

Third, you have *the wounded ego.* This is the most dangerous form. When a narcissist is humiliated, they don't want to be the smartest person in the room anymore; they want to burn the house down to show everyone what they lost.

The beauty is that it doesn't have to be something big.

It could be a series of small things, like people not recognizing the effort, being constantly corrected, left out, judged, disrespected, humiliated, etc. So you have all the little attacks on their ego that compound over time and drive them to destroy the organization, their family, or their country.

Manipulating these people is not difficult. You recognize they were wronged, then you twist the knife by amplifying their anger, and finally, you give them a way to take revenge.

We’ve talked about the Western spies, Mossad, and KGB, but what about the Chinese?

They’re very active, especially when it comes to stealing tech secrets.

And one of their most effective strategies is the…

**4. Thousand Grain of Sand**

Imagine intelligence agencies targeting a beach.

*Russia* would likely surface a submarine off the coast, send a few scuba divers, collect some sand, and then escape. It’s loud and risky but they usually go after highly valuable targets so it’s worth it.

*The US* would send one of its top spies at night to steal a bucket of sand or use its satellites to determine its composition.

So both of them will spend a great deal of money and put their spies or elite soldiers at great risk to get that bucket of sand.

But *China* would likely send 1,000 tourists, and each would bring back 1 grain in their pocket.

Individually, each grain is useless. But when you have all of them in Beijing, then you can reverse engineer the entire composition of the beach.

Now why should you care?

In this case, the grain of sand is not some scientist or Chief Technology Officer... It's you.

Someone will reach out to you for consultation work. They just want your expert opinion on one small project. (this work can last months).

They use the **MICE** framework to find your lever, and they use **Ego Suspension** to make you feel great for helping them. And of course, you make some money. Nothing harmless.

The problem is that without knowing, you've given them some sensitive information about your company or government institution.

You might say, ""Ok, so what? I gave this information unintentionally. It's not my fault.""

Well, the prosecutor might not see it that way.

But even if the law doesn't get to you, the relationship with your friend will change.

They will threaten to make it public, forcing you to do more and more for them.

In other words, the same person who made you feel like the most important person is holding a leash around your neck.

Do you think I'm being overly dramatic?

For many people reading this, I might.

But if you live in the Western World, [especially in the US](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches-and-testimony/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states), you bet I'm not. Because the Chinese fully understand the importance of ordinary people.

And this leads us to one of the most vicious threats in the world of intelligence:

**5. The Gray Man**

We all tend to focus on the sharks - The ambitious, charismatic people. And we ignore the quiet or the mediocre ones.

If you were a CIA agent in the 1980s and you met Aldrich Ames, you wouldn't have looked twice. He was a middle-aged, boring officer who was drunk half the time.

One day, he walked into the Soviet embassy and offered them the names of Russians who were spying for the CIA.

Happily, they paid him big sums of money, over and over and over... then, one by one, the most valuable double spies were dropping like flies.

Dmitri Polyakov, Adolf Tolkachev, and Valery Martynov were executed. Oleg Gordievsky barely escaped with his life.

The beauty was that Ames wasn't even hiding. He was living a luxurious life on a government salary.

You would think in a building full of spies, he would be caught in a month. But his colleagues explained it away. They might have thought that he inherited that money or had a rich wife.

I think they didn't respect him enough to suspect him.

It took the CIA nine years to figure it out.

But during that time, he gave up the identities of over 100 US and Allied assets.

So when you ignore the quiet people, you leave yourself open to the biggest betrayals.

Whether it's a disgruntled employee, a partner, or a family member you've stopped paying attention to... that indifference will likely cost you a lot in the long run.

I had a woman move in with me 2 weeks ago around the same age. I never ever dreamed I would going through this in my whole life! 
She told me she was an Uber driver which was fine. I never had her sign any agreements and she paid me for the rest of December (pro rated) 
The next day after she moves in I knew something bad was going to happen. Her behavior right off was paranoid schizophrenia. I live in a small gated nice safe condo community. She proceeds to put up a ring camera at the front door. Did not give me access to it. Being the nice naive person I am I didn’t say anything for a day or so. Then she puts up a camera in the living room. At this point I’m getting SUPER uncomfortable with her being in my condo. 

All of this is going on while I’m trying to work and see 40+ patients at the hospital I work at. I text her while I was at work and asked her to take the cameras down. When I get home from work I saw that she had taken the living room cam down but not the ring door cam. 
After this incident. Things get weird. She asked me “did you have people over last night?” I said no why— the door ring cam is still up— wouldn’t she know if I had people over? I never have anyone over. All i do is work and come home, eat and go to bed. 
I said no why? She said some of my coffee pods were missing. I was thinking WTF?!? She had been counting my coffee pods??!! 
I told her I have a Keurig at work (which I do) and took some to work with me. I’m wondering why I have to explain everything to this woman. She is making me super uncomfortable in my own home. 
Then she starts avoiding me and not being home when I get home from work. Like it’s obvious. She keeps her door closed at all times. My landlord had me do a background check on her the day she moved in which came up “clear” but he said sometimes there will be pages missing and that’s where the trouble starts. 
The day she moved in I asked her why she needed to leave her current dwelling and asked how long she had lived there. She told me her roommate was putting “something” in her shampoo to make her hair fall out and she is suing her. Hmm this is a strange story I thought. She also told me her roommate was doing cocaine. I said did you see her doing coke? She says no she could just tell. Hmmm. Weird. After the camera incident I wanted her GONE. 
I do not have  time for this childish bullshit. 

She told me she lived with that roommate for 2 weeks. 
After about a week or little more. I’m done with this. I ask her to leave and she doesn’t. She is sending me paragraphs of texts messages while I am at work threatening to call the police. I’m so busy at work I don’t have time nor I want to respond to this shit. All I said was please do. 

After a couple of days with no police coming to take me away, I see she had move some boxes out while being on the phone with someone so she doesn’t have to confront me. Thank God I was thinking. I have never in my life had to deal with someone like this. The next day she is still here. 
I come home from work and put the rest of her things outside and have a locksmith come change the locks. 
I hear someone knocking at my door. It’s her and the police. 
I invited them in but not her. I can see the officer is seeing just how dumb this situation is. He let her get some clothes out of the dryer and I thought it was over. NOW an office has called me while I was at work and says she has put a restraining order on ME but it got denied. Yesterday I got served to go to court THURSDAY. I am having an out of body experience right now. How can someone be this crazy? Has she done this to other  people? 
On the papers they served me , she is accusing me of stealing her clothes, coming at her with a “knife or blunt object” and stealing her shampoo and being on drugs so bad that I was drooling in my drink?? WTF!? 
All false accusations. Her clothes would be way too big for me. I have special expensive shampoo for MY hair. My things are MUCH nicer than her things. I wish I had more time to find an attorney and I can’t believe this. I went to 4 law office’s yesterday and they were all closed. I’m just dumbfounded at this point and NO she doesn’t have ANY proof of any of these allegations against me. Thanks for letting me vent and sorry this is so long but I’m almost about to break.

So as you may know Mormons have the WOW (WORD OF WISDOM) which tells them not to drink coffee, tea, etc.. as well as no cursing. 

Well because of how I am I express myself sometimes through cursing.. mostly to my wife or friends. But sometimes I let a few slip here and there... 

Well I was recently at my in laws house and let a few slip. Nothing bad (I think) I said like shit or bitching.. and I did call someone out saying what they were doing was bullshit (long story) 

But that's about it.. and now my fil is messaging my wife telling her that he needs to have a talk with me because of my cursing. 

From my experience cursing is just a way to express yourself. It's just words and nothing more. 

But they see cursing as the ultimate sin (which tbh I think they're pride in themselves is more of a sin but okay) 

They won't watch r rated movies and will even turn off pg-13 movies because of the cursing. 

And tbh i think it's very very childish that they act that way. And I told my wife that I won't be going over there anymore because if they're so sensitive over that then I can't guarantee I won't cuss. 

So am I the asshole to be like that? To distance myself from them because they don't like the way I express myself?

I keep thinking about what love actually is. And it’s Infuriating. It’s not fireworks or drama. It’s choosing someone even when they’re ""boring"", sick or when life is falling apart. It’s looking at them and feeling peace. People confuse this quiet kind of love for boredom. It drives me nuts. Real love doesn’t shout. It’s steady. Persistent. Stubborn. 

It’s in the little things. Making coffee just the way they like it. Or not at all if they dont. Listening to the same stories again and again without sighing. The hugs. The little hand holdings. Laughing at their disgustingly dumb jokes in the middle of the night. loving them when they're sick. Loving them when they fail at things They were sure theyd win. And especially when They start to think that Theyre not impressive anymore and their energy drops and life keeps asking anyway. 

Its the quiet mornings. Shared silences. Grocery runs. Folding laundry together. Planning nothing but feeling everything. Seeing them at their worst. When theyre exhausted, Grumpy, unsure, and still thinking they’re the most important person in the world. Because they are.

I keep seeing people chase excitement, confuse chemistry for love. I want the messy, imperfect stay-with-me-even-when-its-hard kind of love. The kind that burns quietly, keeps you awake at night. That kind of love doesn’t need to roar. It sneaks into your chest. Makes ordinary life feel sacred. Makes you want to be better, not because they ask you to, but because you can’t imagine life without them. So you step up. Choose them everyday even when its hard. How beautiful and rare is that

It’s not the kind that burns fast and leaves a pile of ashes. It’s the kind that quietly grows roots, unshakable, even when the wind tries to knock it down. Realizing it exists (that it can exist) is almost too beautiful to hold. 

Love isnt loud, but everyone acts like it has to be. To whoever is reading this, I know you’re thinking of someone specific right now. Go tell them you love them. ",2,1767455251.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I’m a 32-year-old woman in the Boston area who recently escaped a long-term relationship (RIP, you taught me things). 

I’m not trying to sprint into another relationship, but I am very much interested in fun, connection, and not being a hermit during this transitional era of my life.

I’m open to meeting all genders and people of all orientations. Mostly I’m looking for emotionally decent humans who want friendship, community, and maybe some light chaos (the good kind). 

To be clear, I’m not looking to jump into a relationship right away. Strictly looking for friends. 

Bonus points if you’re:

	•	Newly single, happily unattached or practice ethical non-monogamy (ENM). 

	•	Down for yoga classes, dance studios, or pretending we’re flexible

	•	Interested in being wingpeople for each other (IRL or on dating apps. Let’s gas each other up respectfully)

	•	Comfortable with clearly communicated, consensual, platonic affection like hugs, cuddles, and general wholesome touch (boundaries = sexy, always)

The dream?

A small crew to grab coffee/wine, try new spots, hype each other up, flirt responsibly, and remind each other that we’re hot, interesting, and doing our best.

If enough folks are into this, I’d be totally down to start a Discord so we can organize chaos… I mean, hangouts.

I do not have a history of pancreatitis and it took a while to determine that my misbehaving mast cells were causing the issue with my pancreas. I am very thankful that my GI is also an expert in MCAS or I might be still suffering.  

I determined early on that I needed a higher dose of creon when eating dairy especially anything full fat.  I also just need a higher dose than the starting dose in general.  I take 3 creon 36,000 with meals and 1-2 with snacks depending on the size/type.  

So here is where adhd comes in.  I generally use oat creamer in my coffee.  I don’t seem to have any trouble with digesting it and don’t need to worry about taking creon with it.  I have had a terrible flare of symptoms the past few days and just this morning realized it may be because I ran out of my oat creamer and have been using egg nog in my coffee as a holiday treat.  I tend to drink my coffee over the course of the day so I’m not sure when I would even take the creon with it.  ADHD means I tend to set the cup down and get sidetracked and then come back to it later, rinse and repeat till I stop drinking coffee mid afternoon.  (Usually just a total of 1-2 cups).  I will need to switch back to oat creamer obviously but the bigger question is how to manage that sort of ""grazing"" Behavior.  Like at a party.  Or if you, like me, can get distracted mid task (meal)?

1q2xosu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1q2xosu/how_to_focus_12_hours_a_day_the_sciencebased/,How to Focus 12 Hours a Day: The Science-Based Strategy That Actually Works,"Most people think deep focus is some superhuman trait reserved for tech bros chugging energy drinks or productivity gurus with perfect morning routines. But here's the thing: our brains aren't wired for the shallow, fragmented attention modern life demands. We're exhausted because we're constantly context-switching, not because we're actually doing deep work.

I spent months studying how high performers maintain focus, from neuroscience research to Dan Koe's frameworks on attention management. What I found changed everything about how I work. The best part? It's not about willpower or discipline. It's about designing your environment and energy correctly.

Here's what actually works:

Your brain needs ONE priority, not ten

 Stop treating your to-do list like a buffet. Your prefrontal cortex, the part responsible for executive function, gets depleted with every decision you make. When you're juggling multiple priorities, you're burning through mental energy before noon.

 Research from Cal Newport's Deep Work shows that the most productive people protect 3-4 hour blocks for singular focus. Not ""I'll work on three projects today."" ONE thing. ONE outcome. The rest is just noise.

 Dan Koe calls this ""ruthless prioritization."" Pick the ONE project that moves the needle. Everything else gets scheduled for later or deleted entirely.

Energy management beats time management every single time

 We're obsessed with ""managing time"" when really, we should be managing energy states. Your focus isn't consistent throughout the day, it follows ultradian rhythms (90-120 minute cycles).

 Dr. Andrew Huberman's podcast breaks this down perfectly: your brain operates in 90-minute focus windows followed by 20-minute recovery periods. Push past this? You're just grinding with diminishing returns.

 Track when YOU focus best. For me, it's 6am-10am and 2pm-6pm. I schedule deep work there and meetings/admin during my energy dips. Sounds obvious but most people do the opposite, wasting peak hours on emails.

Your environment is sabotaging you (fix this immediately)

 Notifications are attention cancer. Every ping fragments your focus and it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully recover, according to UC Irvine research. That ""quick check"" on your phone? You just nuked 30 minutes of productive time.

 Freedom app blocks distracting websites and apps during work sessions. Set it for your focus blocks and suddenly, Instagram doesn't exist. It's aggressive but necessary.

 Physical environment matters too. Clear desk, noise-canceling headphones, specific ""focus music"" (I use [Brain.fm](http://Brain.fm) which uses neuroscience-based audio to enhance concentration). Your brain learns to associate these environmental cues with deep work.

Boredom is the secret weapon nobody talks about

 We've trained ourselves to reach for stimulation the second things feel uncomfortable. Waiting in line? Phone. Between tasks? Scroll Twitter. This kills your ability to sustain attention on hard things.

 Insight Timer has excellent boredom tolerance meditations. Start with 10 minutes of doing literally nothing. No phone, no book, nothing. Just sit. It's painful at first but it rewires your dopamine system to tolerate less stimulation.

 BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns high-quality knowledge sources like books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio podcasts. Built by a team from Columbia University, it creates adaptive learning plans based on your goals. You can customize each session from a quick 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The depth control means you can match your learning to your current energy state, which fits perfectly with the ultradian rhythm approach. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that you can talk to anytime, pause mid-podcast to ask questions, or get book recommendations. The voice options are actually addictive, from calm and soothing for evening sessions to energetic styles when you need a boost during low-energy windows.

 The book Dopamine Nation by Dr. Anna Lembke explains this perfectly: constant stimulation raises your dopamine baseline, making focused work feel impossibly boring by comparison. You need to reset this.

Recovery is non-negotiable

 You can't focus 12 hours if you're running on 5 hours of sleep and three coffees. Sleep research from Dr. Matthew Walker shows that even slight sleep deprivation tanks cognitive performance by 20-30%.

 Whoop strap tracks recovery metrics (HRV, sleep quality, strain). It'll tell you objectively if you're recovered enough for deep work or if you need to ease up. Data removes the guesswork.

 Active recovery matters too. Walking breaks between focus sessions, proper meals (not just snacks at your desk), and actual downtime where you're not consuming content. Your brain needs white space to consolidate learning.

The 12-hour myth needs reframing

 It's not 12 hours of grinding. It's 6-8 hours of actual deep work spread across 12 hours with proper breaks, meals, movement. The difference is massive.

 Most people spend 12 hours ""working"" but maybe 3 hours actually focused. You're just performing busyness. Real focus is intentional, bounded, and followed by real rest.

 Start with ONE 90-minute deep work block. Master that before adding more. Quality over quantity always.

The truth is, most people never experience what real focus feels like because they're trapped in reactive mode. Checking notifications, responding to messages, context-switching between tasks. That's not work. That's just being busy.

Focus is a skill. It requires intentional practice, proper rest, and an environment designed for deep work. But once you dial it in? Everything changes. You get more done in 4 focused hours than most people do in a week of ""hustle.""",1,1767454898.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False

It's gotten absolutely ridiculous. After getting quotes to furnish my investment property last year and nearly choking on the numbers, I decided to do something about it.

The result? I imported an entire 40ft container of custom furniture from Foshan, China for around $60,000 AUD landed cost. The same pieces from Australian retailers? Easily $180,000+.

Here's exactly how I did it and everything I learned along the way.

The Challenge I needed to furnish a complete 4-bedroom house plus outdoor areas:

* Custom modular sofas (specific dimensions for my awkward living room layout)
* Full kitchen cabinets (non-standard measurements)
* Complete bedroom furniture sets for 4 rooms
* Outdoor pergola with custom specs
* Dining sets and misc furniture
* Storage solutions throughout Getting quotes from Australian suppliers was genuinely depressing:
* Lead times: 16-24 weeks minimum
* Zero flexibility on measurements
* ""Custom"" meant picking from 3 preset options
* Prices that made absolutely no sense

The breaking point? A kitchen quote for $42,000. For cabinets. Just cabinets.

Why I Went With Agent in China

Look, I'll be honest - I spent about two weeks trying to do this myself. Researching Alibaba suppliers, getting quotes, trying to coordinate everything.

Then I had a moment of clarity: The complexity wasn't worth the 8-9% I'd save by going direct.

Here's what changed my mind:

* Language barriers (my Mandarin is non-existent)
* Quality control nightmares waiting to happen
* No clue how to verify factory credentials properly
* Coordinating 10+ different manufacturers
* Making sure everything arrived at the same time
* Biosecurity compliance (this is MASSIVE in Australia)
* One mistake could cost me thousands Finding my agent I found my agent through a recommendation in an expat business group on Facebook. He's based in Foshan, been doing furniture exports for 4 years, and specializes in Australian shipments (which was crucial for biosecurity compliance).

What he charged: 8-9% commission on the total order value. No flat fees, no hidden charges, no coordination fees.

What he handled:

* Factory sourcing and vetting
* Quality inspections at each factory (with detailed photo reports)
* Price negotiation (saved me about 25% off initial quotes)
* Coordinating production timelines across multiple factories
* Managing all biosecurity compliance
* Container loading supervision
* Export documentation
* Being my single point of contact for everything

Total agent fees: \~$5,580 Worth every single cent.

The Furniture Breakdown

Custom Modular Sofas (3 Complete Sets) The Challenge: My living room has this weird alcove that makes standard sofas look absolutely ridiculous. Needed L-shaped configurations with very specific measurements to make it work.

What I ordered:

* 3 custom modular sofa sets
* Main living: 4.2m x 2.8m L-shape
* Rumpus room: 3.6m x 2.4m L-shape
* Media room: 2.8m x 2.2m compact L-shape
* Fabric: Performance linen (spill-resistant - important for investment property)
* Colors: Neutral grey and warm beige

The Process:

1. Sent detailed measurements and room photos to Vinay via WhatsApp
2. He connected me with 3 manufacturers who specialize in modular sofas
3. Got CAD drawings back within 48 hours
4. Had video calls where Vinay showed me fabric options in the factory showroom
5. Reviewed high-res photos and videos of fabric textures, colors in different lighting
6. Made adjustments to cushion depth and arm height based on what I saw
7. Approved final designs with material specifications

Cost: $8,400 AUD (Australian retail equivalent: $28,000+)

Quality Control: Vinay sent me photos at 3 production stages:

* Frame construction (solid hardwood, not particle board - he verified with close-up shots)
* Cushion filling (high-density foam, not the cheap stuff - he literally cut one open to show me)
* Final assembly and fabric application before packaging

The attention to detail here was insane. He caught that one manufacturer tried to substitute a cheaper foam and made them redo it. Didn't cost me anything extra.

Kitchen Cabinets (Complete Kitchen)

The Challenge: Australian kitchen quotes were $35,000-$45,000 for a standard kitchen. Mine had non-standard ceiling heights (2.7m) and I wanted soft-close everything, plus specific internal configurations.

What I ordered:

* 12 base cabinets (custom heights for appliances)
* 8 wall cabinets (extending to ceiling - no wasted space)
* Island bench unit (2.4m x 1.2m with storage)
* Floor-to-ceiling pantry unit
* All hardware: soft-close hinges, drawer runners, handles
* Benchtop: Didn't ship this - got quartz locally (too risky) Materials Specified:
* Cabinet boxes: 18mm plywood (NOT MDF - this was important)
* Doors: 2-pack polyurethane finish in matte white
* Hardware: Blum soft-close (specified the actual brand, not knockoffs)
* Internal fittings: Pull-out drawers, spice racks, corner solutions

The Process:

1. Hired a local kitchen designer in Australia ($800) for detailed plans
2. Sent complete CAD drawings with measurements to Vinay
3. He found a manufacturer in Foshan specializing in export kitchens
4. They modified designs for Australian standard appliance sizes
5. Got 3D renders for approval via email
6. Had video calls where we walked through the factory showing me door samples, hardware options
7. He sent videos of the polyurethane finish being applied and curing
8. Made changes to handle styles and internal drawer configurations
9. Approved materials and finishes after seeing everything on video Cost: $12,600 AUD (Australian equivalent: $38,000+)

Critical Detail: We were ensured all cabinets were:

* Flat-packed (saves massive shipping space and costs)
* Numbered with detailed assembly diagrams in English
* Treated for Australian biosecurity (heat treatment + certification)
* Pre-drilled for easy assembly
* Packaged with all hardware separated and labeled The manufacturer even included extra hinges and drawer runners. That attention to detail was impressive.

Outdoor Pergola (Custom Design) The Challenge: Wanted a 6m x 4m pergola for the backyard entertaining area. Australian quotes were $15,000-$22,000 for aluminum structures. Insane. What I ordered:

* Powder-coated aluminum frame (marine-grade, rust-resistant)
* Adjustable louvre roof system (can control sun/shade)
* Integrated LED lighting strips in the beams
* All mounting hardware and detailed installation guide
* Custom dimensions: 6m x 4m x 3.2m height
* Color: Dulux Monument (matched to house exterior)

The Process:

1. Sent backyard photos, measurements, and design inspiration images to Vinay
2. He connected me with an outdoor structures manufacturer
3. They provided engineering drawings (important for council approval)
4. Had a video call where they showed me the aluminum profile samples, louvre mechanism
5. Vinay filmed the powder coating process so I could see the color match
6. Specified powder coat color with RAL code
7. Reviewed videos of the LED system being tested
8. Made adjustments to LED placement and louvre angle range Cost: $8,900 AUD (Australian equivalent: $19,000+)

The pergola came with the most detailed installation manual I've ever seen. Every bolt numbered, every step photographed.

Bedroom Furniture (4 Complete Sets)

What I ordered for each bedroom:

* Queen bed frame with under-bed storage drawers
* 2 x matching bedside tables with soft-close drawers
* Wardrobe (different sizes per room - 2m, 2.4m, 2.8m, 3m widths)
* Dresser with mirror

Materials:

* Solid oak frames and oak veneer panels
* Soft-close drawer runners throughout
* Dovetail joints (sign of quality construction)
* Matching handles across all pieces
* Natural oil finish (not the cheap spray lacquer)

The Process:

1. Selected style from manufacturer's catalog
2. Customized dimensions for each room
3. Had video calls where Vinay showed me wood samples, finish options
4. Specified internal wardrobe configurations (shelves vs hanging space)
5. Reviewed videos of drawer construction, dovetail joints being cut
6. Chose handle style and finish after seeing them on video
7. Approved wood samples and finish samples based on high-res photos and videos Cost: $14,200 AUD total for all 4 rooms (Australian equivalent: $48,000+)

Quality Check: Vinay inspected drawer construction, joint quality, and finish consistency. He rejected one dresser that had a slight color mismatch and they remade it. Didn't cost me anything extra. He sent me before/after videos showing the issue and the corrected version. Dining Sets & Miscellaneous Furniture

What else went in the container:

* 2 x dining tables (8-seater solid oak, 6-seater for breakfast nook)
* 16 x dining chairs (mix of upholstered and solid wood)
* 3 x coffee tables (different styles for different rooms)
* 2 x TV units with cable management
* 3 x bookshelf units (floor to ceiling)
* Outdoor dining set (aluminum table + 8 chairs, weather-resistant)
* Various side tables and console tables Cost: $7,600 AUD

My agent helped me maximize the container space by suggesting a few additional pieces that would fit perfectly in the remaining space. Smart thinking. He literally measured out the container space and sent me a diagram showing what else could fit.

The Quality Control Process

This is where Vinay absolutely earned his commission. He personally visited each factory during production:

Inspection Points:

1. Material Verification - Confirmed actual wood species, hardware brands matched specs. He sent close-up photos of wood grain, hardware brand stamps
2. Construction Check - Joint quality, structural integrity, finish consistency. Videos of drawers being opened/closed, doors swinging
3. Functionality Test - Every drawer, door, moving part tested. He literally tested every single drawer and hinge
4. Finish Inspection - Paint/stain quality, no defects, color matching. Photos in different lighting conditions
5. Packaging Verification - Proper protection for shipping, labeling correct

He sent me detailed photo and video reports at each stage via WhatsApp. Found issues with 3 items:

* Dining chairs had wrong fabric initially (caught before production started - showed me fabric swatches on video)
* One wardrobe had a scratch on the door (they remade just the door - he sent before/after photos )
* Sofa cushions were slightly wrong density (caught during inspection, remade - he literally sat on them and showed me the difference)

Without Vinay, I would have received all of these with problems. That alone justified his fee. Biosecurity Compliance (THIS IS CRITICAL FOR AUSTRALIA)

Australia doesn't mess around with biosecurity. Vinay handled all of this, which was honestly the most stressful part for me to think about:

Wood Treatment Requirements:

* All solid wood: Heat treated to 56°C for minimum 30 minutes
* ISPM 15 certification for all wooden components and packaging
* Fumigation certificates where required
* Treatment stamps on all timber Packaging Requirements:
* Absolutely no straw or hay packing materials (prohibited)
* Plastic wrap and cardboard only
* Clean, new packaging materials only
* No soil, seeds, or organic matter

Documentation Required:

* Manufacturer's Declaration (stating all materials used)
* Heat treatment certificates for each wooden item
* Phytosanitary certificate from Chinese authorities
* Detailed packing list with material specifications for every item
* Photos of treatment stamps Cost of compliance: Included in agent's coordination, but he said it typically costs $600-800 if done separately.

The documentation was perfect. Not a single issue at Australian customs. Vinay sent me scanned copies of everything before shipping so I could review it.

Container Loading Day

Vinay supervised the entire loading process in Foshan. This was absolutely crucial because: Strategic Loading Order:

1. Heavy items first (pergola, kitchen cabinets) at the bottom and front
2. Sofas and upholstered items in the middle
3. Fragile items (mirrors, glass) at the top
4. Everything strapped, secured, and braced
5. Gaps filled with smaller items to prevent shifting Container Specifications:

* 40ft High Cube container
* Internal dimensions: 12.03m x 2.35m x 2.69m
* Total cubic meters: \~76 CBM
* Maximum payload: 26,300 kg

What Actually Fit:

* All furniture listed above
* Still had about 7 CBM of space left
* Vinay suggested adding some extra outdoor chairs and side tables
* Final weight: \~8,200 kg (well under limit) Vinay sent me a complete video walkthrough of the loaded container before sealing. I could see everything was properly secured and protected. That peace of mind was priceless. The video was like 15 minutes long, showing every section of the container.

Shipping & Logistics

The Real Cost Breakdown Furniture FOB (Free On Board) Price:

* Sofas: $8,400
* Kitchen cabinets: $12,600
* Pergola: $8,900

* Subtotal: $920 AUD Grand Total: $68,507 AUD Australian Retail Equivalent: $185,000+ (conservative estimate based on actual quotes I received) Actual Savings: $116,493 ROI: 170% savings

Even accounting for my time (maybe 50 hours total), this was an absolute no-brainer. The Freight Forwarder Experience Vinay recommended a freight forwarder he works with regularly (they handle his shipments weekly). They were excellent:

In China:

* Container pickup from Foshan factories
* Transport to Guangzhou port
* Export customs clearance
* Bill of lading preparation
* Container tracking

In Australia:

* Import customs declaration lodgement
* Biosecurity inspection coordination
* Communication with Department of Agriculture
* Port to door delivery arrangement
* Unpacking at my property (I paid extra $180 for this)

Communication: They had an Australian office in Sydney, so I could call during business hours. Made a huge difference compared to dealing with time zones.

Australian Customs & Quarantine Process What Actually Happened: Day 1: Container arrived at Port Botany, Sydney Day 2: Freight forwarder lodged import declaration electronically Day 3: Biosecurity inspection scheduled (mandatory for wooden furniture) Day 4: Inspector physically checked:

* Treatment certificates matched items
* Random physical inspection of items
* Packaging materials inspection
* No signs of pests, soil, or contamination
* Treatment stamps visible on timber

Day 5: Clearance granted, container released for delivery

Pro Tip: Having all documentation absolutely perfect meant zero delays. I've heard horror stories of people waiting 3-4 weeks because of missing paperwork or incorrect treatment certificates.

Delivery Day

Container truck arrived at my property at 8:00 AM sharp. Two guys unloaded everything into my garage in about 2.5 hours.

Condition Check:

* 99% perfect condition
* 2 dining chair legs had very minor scratches (not visible when assembled)
* 1 cabinet door had a tiny dent on the back panel (not visible when installed)
* Everything else: flawless Packaging Quality:
* Everything wrapped in thick cardboard and multiple layers of plastic
* All corners protected with foam edge protectors
* Fragile items double-boxed with ""FRAGILE"" stickers
* Assembly hardware in clearly labeled bags (in English!)
* Instruction manuals for everything Honestly, the packaging was better than most Australian furniture I've bought. Assembly & Installation

What I Did Myself:

* Assembled all bedroom furniture (pretty straightforward with the instructions)
* Put together dining tables and chairs
* Installed TV units and bookshelves
* Assembled outdoor furniture

Total time: About 3 full days spread over 2 weeks What I Hired Out:

* Kitchen installation: $2,800 (local carpenter, took 3 days, excellent work)
* Pergola installation: $1,800 (took 2 days, needed 2 people for safety)
* Sofa assembly: $400 (they're heavy and awkward, worth paying)

Total Installation Costs: $5,000

Installation Experience: The carpenter who did my kitchen was impressed with the quality. He said the cabinets were better than most Australian-made ones he's installed. The pre-drilling was perfect, everything lined up, hardware was quality.

Problems I Encountered (And How They Were Solved)

Problem 1: Communication Time Zones

* Vinay was 2-3 hours ahead (depending on daylight saving)
* Solution: Used WhatsApp for async communication, scheduled video calls for important decisions. Worked perfectly.

Problem 2: Seeing Samples Without Visiting

* Couldn't physically touch fabrics and finishes before ordering
* Solution: Vinay did detailed video calls from factory showrooms, showing me everything in different lighting. He'd literally walk around with his phone showing me samples from every angle. Also sent high-res photos and videos of materials

. Problem 3: Minor Hardware Substitution

* Some drawer runners weren't Blum as specified (cheaper Chinese alternatives)
* Solution: Vinay caught this during inspection, negotiated a $420 refund. I replaced them locally for $280. Net positive

. Problem 4: Pergola Engineering Documentation

* Australian council wanted specific wind load calculations
* Solution: Vinay got the manufacturer to provide detailed engineering specs with calculations. Took an extra week but council approved it.

Problem 5: Container Delivery Timing

* Original delivery date changed due to port congestion (not Vinay's fault)
* Solution: Freight forwarder kept me updated daily. Only delayed 4 days total. Not a big deal.

Problem 6: One Wardrobe Door Slightly Off

* During assembly, one wardrobe door didn't align perfectly
* Solution: Local carpenter adjusted it in 10 minutes. Minor issue, easily fixed. What I'd Do Differently Next Time

1. Schedule More Video Calls Earlier Start video calls with Vinay at factories 2-3 months before ordering. I was too eager and rushed this part. The video calls were incredibly valuable.
2. Get Multiple Agent Quotes I went with the first agent recommended to me. Should have interviewed 2-3 to compare services, fees, and communication styles.
3. Budget More for Local Installation I underestimated local installation costs. Budget at least 8-10% of furniture cost for assembly/installation.
4. Request More Progress Videos I relied on photos and videos. Should have asked for even more detailed videos during production, especially of internal construction.
5. Plan Delivery Timing Better I had the container delivered when I was still doing other renovations. Should have coordinated better so I could install everything immediately.
6. Get Benchtops Quoted Earlier Waiting until after cabinets arrived to get benchtop quotes was stressful. Should have had this organized beforehand.

Why Using Agent Was Worth It

Time Saved:

* No factory hunting (he had vetted suppliers ready)
* No back-and-forth with multiple manufacturers in broken English
* No translation issues or miscommunications
* Single point of contact for everything
* He handled all the stressful parts Money Saved:
* Negotiated 18-25% off initial factory quotes (saved \~$9,300 - $12,900)
* Caught quality issues before shipping (saved potential thousands in replacements)
* Ensured proper biosecurity compliance (avoided potential fines/delays)
* Coordinated production timing so everything was ready together (saved on storage fees) Stress Saved:
* Didn't have to worry about getting scammed
* Professional quality control at every stage
* Proper documentation handled correctly
* Insurance claims support available (didn't need it, but good to have)
* Someone who understood both Chinese manufacturing and Australian requirements What 8-9% Commission Got Me:
* Factory vetting and selection
* Price negotiation with manufacturers
* Custom design coordination via video calls
* Quality inspections (3 stages per item with photo/video reports)
* Production timeline management across 5 factories
* Complete biosecurity compliance handling
* All export documentation
* Container loading supervision with video walkthrough
* Shipping coordination
* Problem resolution throughout
* Peace of mind Would I Do It Without an Agent? For a single item? Maybe. For $60K+ of custom furniture across multiple manufacturers? Absolutely not. The risk is too high, the complexity too great, and the potential for costly mistakes too real. Vinay's 9% was the best money I spent on this entire project. Is This Actually Worth It? The Math: Total Investment:
* Furniture landed cost: $68,507
* Installation: $5,000
* Kitchen designer: $800
* My time (design, coordination, assembly): \~50 hours
* Total: $74,307 Australian Retail Equivalent:
* Conservative estimate based on actual quotes: $185,000
* Savings: $110,693 ROI: 149% savings Break-Even Analysis: Even if I valued my time at $150/hour (which is high), I still saved $103,193. Per-Item Savings:
* Sofas: Saved $19,600
* Kitchen: Saved $25,400
* Pergola: Saved $10,100
* Bedrooms: Saved $33,800
* Everything else: Saved $21,793 Every single category had massive savings. Who Should Consider This? This Makes Sense If:
* You need $30K+ of furniture (container economics work better)
* You want custom sizes/configurations not available locally
* You're furnishing multiple rooms or properties
* You're okay with 3-4 month timeline
* You can handle or pay for assembly/installation
* You're comfortable with video calls and photos instead of physically seeing samples Skip This If:
* You need furniture urgently (under 1 month)
* You're only buying 1-2 pieces
* You can't handle the coordination effort (even with an agent)
* You absolutely must see and touch everything in person first
* You're extremely risk-averse
* You don't have space to receive a container delivery The Foshan Furniture Market For those curious about Foshan: What's There:
* 3,000+ furniture manufacturers
* Everything from budget to luxury tier
* Specializations: Modern, classic, outdoor, commercial, custom
* Entire districts dedicated to specific furniture types
* Massive wholesale markets
* International buyer services Quality Range:
* Budget tier: IKEA-equivalent quality
* Mid-tier: Freedom/Fantastic Furniture quality
* High-tier: King Living/Jardan quality (what I ordered)



* Luxury tier: Custom designer level What I Ordered: Mid-to-high tier. Solid construction, quality materials, excellent finishes. Not luxury designer pieces, but way better than flat-pack and comparable to high-end Australian brands. Tips for Finding Your Own Agent Where to Look:
* Expat business groups (Facebook, LinkedIn, WeChat)
* Trade show contacts (if you can visit Foshan)
* Referrals from others who've imported (best option)
* Alibaba (some agents have profiles, but verify carefully)
* Furniture industry forums What to Ask Potential Agents:
* How long in business?
* Specialization? (furniture specifically, not general goods)
* Commission structure? (percentage vs flat fee)
* Detailed quality control process?
* How many Australian clients? (biosecurity knowledge crucial)
* Can they provide references?
* What's included in their service?
* How do they handle quality checks? (photos, videos, in-person?)
* Do they do video calls from factories? Red Flags:
* Asking for full payment upfront
* No physical office address in China
* Can't provide verifiable references
* Vague about QC process
* Promises unrealistic timelines
* Unclear fee structure
* Poor English communication (you'll struggle throughout)
* Won't do video calls or factory visits Green Flags:
* Established business (5+ years)
* Clear, transparent fee structure
* Detailed QC process with photo/video documentation
* Multiple Australian client references
* Responsive communication
* Transparent about challenges and timelines
* Understands Australian biosecurity requirements
* Has relationships with freight forwarders
* Willing to do video calls from factories Resources That Helped Me Australian Side:
* Australian Border Force website (biosecurity requirements)
* Department of Agriculture (wood treatment standards)
* ChAFTA agreement details (for duty-free confirmation)
* Local council (for pergola approval requirements) Chinese Side:
* Vinay (my agent - happy to share contact if people DM me)
* Foshan Furniture Fair information (if you want to visit in person) 



* Tools I Used:
* WhatsApp / wechat (communication with Vinay - video calls, photos, messages)
* Google Sheets (tracking everything - costs, timelines, specifications)
* Shipment tracking apps
* Currency converter (AUD/CNY rates fluctuate)
* Google Drive (storing all documentation, photos, and videos) Final Thoughts Importing furniture from Foshan using Vinay as my agent was genuinely one of the best decisions I made for this property. The savings were massive ($110K+), the quality exceeded my expectations, and I got exactly what I wanted in terms of customization. The key was absolutely using an agent. Agent commission was worth every cent for the time saved, stress avoided, quality ensured, and problems prevented. The video calls from factories were game-changers - I could see everything without flying to China. Trying to do this myself would have been a complete nightmare and likely would have cost me more in mistakes. Timeline Reality: This isn't quick. From first contact with Vinay to delivery was about 2-3 months. But for $110K+ in savings? I'd wait twice as long. Quality Verdict: Everything arrived in excellent condition. The furniture is solid, well-made, and looks fantastic. A few very minor issues (scratches, tiny dent) but nothing that affected functionality or appearance. Quality is genuinely better than most Australian furniture I've bought at similar price points. Would I Do It Again? 100% yes. Already planning to import outdoor furniture and some additional pieces for another property. Now that I know the process and have Vinay, it's even easier.

I (30F) met my best friend Phoebe (30F) in kindergarten, and we’ve been close for 25 years. Before this, we spent time together almost daily. I’m her daughter’s godmother, close with her family, and despite normal ups and downs, we always worked things out... until now.

A few years ago, my husband (35M) and I faced unexplained infertility. Most of our friends, including Phoebe, already had kids, and I never imagined we’d struggle.

We started trying in early summer 2022, shortly after I was the MOH in Phoebe’s wedding. Years earlier, she was my MOH but skipped fittings, tastings, and other responsibilities, often leaving me scrambling. It hurt, but I still took my role seriously for her wedding. She was very hands-off, so I handled most things. After her wedding, I created some distance, and we reconnected that fall.

Around that time, my normally regular cycle was off. I was two weeks late, testing negative, but experiencing pregnancy symptoms. I confided in Phoebe, but she brushed it off and instead announced her positive pregnancy test, which felt invalidating. Later that week, she called to share she was pregnant with twins. I congratulated her, but I wasn’t feeling well and didn’t have much emotional capacity.

That weekend, I began bleeding heavily. My doctor couldn’t see me for a few days, so I waited anxiously. During that time, Phoebe texted saying she was hurt that I wasn’t excited enough for her and suggested my reaction came from jealousy. Already overwhelmed, I became defensive. The conversation escalated into a major fight, and I asked for space. My husband urged me to block her, and I did.

At my appointment, doctors confirmed I’d had a chemical pregnancy. My hCG levels had been too low for home tests to detect.

While we weren’t speaking, I learned Phoebe had told mutual friends that my husband and I were “racing” her to get pregnant. This was humiliating, as infertility is deeply personal and not something I was ready to share.

Weeks later, we met for coffee. I shared what I'd learned, took responsibility for my mistakes and tried to talk things through. She doubled down, accused me of jealousy, and even claimed I faked my chemical pregnancy based on a coworker’s experience.

Now, I have an almost two-year-old daughter, and while I’ve physically moved on, I’m not emotionally over that time. Without accountability or an apology, our friendship feels permanently damaged. I miss what we once had, but every interaction reminds me of how she treated me during the hardest period of my life.

This has been eating me alive for months, and I would genuinely like to know if I am in the wrong. So please, be honest... AITA?",3,1767454817.0,AITA_Relationships,2,1.0,False
1q2xn1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingleMenDatingAbroad/comments/1q2xn1q/need_some_advice/,Need some advice.,"I met this gorgeous woman while back. We got coffee, got intimate etc when I was there. We called everyday, video call played PUBg. She even told me she loved me. Then I had to go another work project that took longer than expected and internet was bad. Lost most contact due to work and message her every chance I could get. Anyways I finally was coming back a year later but she got a new boyfriend. It was because of my absence led to it. We were secretly talking, video calling. Planning to meet me for ""coffee"" once I was there. 

I messed up I texted her made her ping go off while he was there. It freaked her out, got stressed. She almost got caught. She told me to text her the next following night. I did. Then she blocks me on WA, unfollows me on IG. It's very disheartening since so much we been through. She finally got back to me on her business page. Telling me very quick she understands, she is serious about him, don't text her please. 

I'm like okay,  is she keeping me as an ""option"" if her new boyfriend it doesn't work out with her? If she was serious about him why she kept secretly talking to me. Which tells me he isn't fulfilling something that she wants/needs. She only acted this way because she almost got caught. I know she is testing me on some bs girls do. I'm like do I continue to text her telling her which I don't care about her bf or wait it out, just go no contact for a while? ",1,1767454785.0,SingleMenDatingAbroad,0,1.0,False

I was so exhausted that not even cocaine could keep me awake. There was no life outside of alcohol anymore. Drinking was my breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The further I step back and look at my life as a drunk, the sadder it is to reflect on. How did something that started out as “fun” turn into this?

I miss the version of me who woke up excited for coffee and a healthy breakfast before the gym. Who ate well, moved her body, and had drinks sometimes, not every day. Who never blacked out. Who didn’t need vodka just to feel normal.

Where did she go?

I’m scared she might be gone forever… but I want to believe she’s still in there somewhere, waiting for me to come back.

And also, FUCK COCAINE!!! Seriously. Don’t do it. It makes everything so much worse. I started in 2022 and it completely changed me as an addict. I don’t even crave coke on its own (thank god) I just don’t want a drink without it. That realization alone feels insane.

I’ve gained THIRTY SIX pounds!!!! It’s because I’ve been drinking 1500 calories a day for the past fucking year. My GOD I look like shit. Might be the biggest reason I want off this fuckin marry go round ride with these drugs. Ughhhhh

I slept pretty good and it was much needed. I am still feeling a bit tired now, but I have to edit the YouTube video still and finish this journal.

It has been a pretty good day though I would say. George and I went to the mall to return the blender that wasn't working so we went to Garden City. I had some coffee again today, but it made me feel pretty good so I was happy. I don't want to make this a habit.

While at the mall I did an approach with Gretta. She is a single mom and was just walking the mall to get out of the house. We had a good vibe and she was very friendly. I felt like I was fun and flirty and was building some good attraction. I gave her my number since I didn't have my Australian phone and I never heard from her. It is good though because I wasn't all that into her.

Feels good just going into sets now and not really hesitating. I am now actively looking for sets now that I know I need to get 10 approaches done a day. It has really changed how I approach the day knowing I have to get so many done.

After the mall George and I went to South Bank. I kept the momentum going and while we were walking I opened a girl sitting alone at a restaurant. Her name was Tiffany and she was eating before she performed at the park. She is a singer and is very creative. We seemed to have a good vibe and she was pretty happy that I approached her. I got her number, but haven't heard anything from her yet. In the set I felt a bit nervous, but I also felt like I was being playful and giving her a good experience. I felt pretty comfortable.

As we were walking along I saw another girl I thought was cute. Because I am actively looking for these girls I didn't hesitate. Her name is Alice and she is from Italy. She has been living in Brisbane for a few months and broke up with her boyfriend a few months ago. She was actually on her way to meet a Tinder date. She was on the phone when I was talking to her and her friend was laughing because of how random it was. I told her she would call her back and then continued to talk to Alice. We talked about somethings she likes to do and I think I did a decent job qualifying her and she was pretty excited to exchange details. I messaged her and then left my phone at home and she blew me up haha. My approach really had an effect on her. She left a voice note and was a bit drunk, but I could see how impressed she was with the approach. It felt like a movie moment for her. It will be interesting to see what happens tomorrow. I actually matched with this girl on Tinder, but didn't message her in time I guess. She did say her date was boring so I think that helped me out even more.

I approached another girl who was also on her way to a date. She was from Australia and was pretty cute. I didn't think she would stay, but she kept talking to me. She sent me a message saying I made her day which is always great to hear. I can't remember much else of the of the conversation.

I also got a number from a girl who was working at Felon's. Her name is Gemma and she is from Scotland. I asked her what a cute girl from Scotland is doing in Australia and she seemed to really like it. I felt like I was doing a decent job with attraction and she was asking me questions, but the close seemed a bit shaky. Still good to get her number too.

Overall it was a pretty great day for approaching and I felt like I am getting to be just a social guy. I can really see the improvements and can tell that if I keep this up that I will be dating very attractive women consistently. It is 1:30am now and I still need to edit the YouTube video. I am hoping that it turns out well since I was sitting on the microphone. I really don't want to shoot a new video.

My brain isn't really working anymore and I need some sleep. This challenge is getting pretty tough so far.

**Approaches:**

|I was sitting at the coffee shop with George. I saw a girl walk by. I could not tell if she was that cute or not, but I went in anyways. She was a little bit startled when I approached, and I acted like she scared me, and she was very receptive. The conversation went very well. She is from Brisbane. She has a child. She said she did not want anything casual, but the interaction was good. It was flirty. It was fun. I felt like I was being myself and building attraction. I got her number. We will see if I follow up. Not quite sure yet.|
|:-|
|I was walking with George in Southbank, saw a girl eating alone at a restaurant, so I went in and said she looked nice. She was very receptive right away and said her name was Tiff. She is a singer and has been living in Brisbane for a few months now. She was about an hour away from performing. The conversation was pretty fun and flirty. I might have been a bit too serious, but overall, it was a good set. She is 21. I did get her number. I have not heard a response yet from the feeler text.|
|While in Southbank, I saw a girl who was walking, and she was on the phone. I had to front stop her. I told her she looked very nice. She was very receptive and thought it was pretty random, so I acknowledged that a few times. She was on her way to her Tinder date. She said I looked very familiar. It turns out I matched with her last night on Tinder and never responded back, but she was very receptive. She got off the phone with her friend. Her friend was actually laughing because of the situation, and I think it was a very strong indicator that I am different because she has been in Brisbane for about a year. She broke up with her boyfriend five months ago. She was feeling a bit lonely the last couple days, so she said she would give Tinder a try. I think I stood out.

1q2xlbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q2xlbp/im_tired_of_love_being_mistaken_for_excitement/,I’m tired of love being mistaken for excitement,"I keep thinking about what love actually is. And it’s Infuriating. It’s not fireworks or drama. It’s choosing someone even when they’re ""boring"", sick or when life is falling apart. It’s looking at them and feeling peace. People confuse this quiet kind of love for boredom. It drives me nuts. Real love doesn’t shout. It’s steady. Persistent. Stubborn. 

It’s in the little things. Making coffee just the way they like it. Or not at all if they dont. Listening to the same stories again and again without sighing. The hugs. The little hand holdings. Laughing at their disgustingly dumb jokes in the middle of the night. loving them when they're sick. Loving them when they fail at things They were sure theyd win. And especially when They start to think that Theyre not impressive anymore and their energy drops and life keeps asking anyway. 

Its the quiet mornings. Shared silences. Grocery runs. Folding laundry together. Planning nothing but feeling everything. Seeing them at their worst. When theyre exhausted, Grumpy, unsure, and still thinking they’re the most important person in the world. Because they are.

I keep seeing people chase excitement, confuse chemistry for love. I want the messy, imperfect stay-with-me-even-when-its-hard kind of love. The kind that burns quietly, keeps you awake at night. That kind of love doesn’t need to roar. It sneaks into your chest. Makes ordinary life feel sacred. Makes you want to be better, not because they ask you to, but because you can’t imagine life without them. So you step up. Choose them everyday even when its hard. How beautiful and rare is that

It’s not the kind that burns fast and leaves a pile of ashes. It’s the kind that quietly grows roots, unshakable, even when the wind tries to knock it down. Realizing it exists (that it can exist) is almost too beautiful to hold. 

Love isnt loud, but everyone acts like it has to be. To whoever is reading this, I know you’re thinking of someone specific right now. Go tell them you love them. ",1,1767454672.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1q2xivm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1q2xivm/faith_valentine/,Faith Valentine,"

   With the day just getting started I’m excited for work. Today we receive our weekly mission at my job. I have been groomed into the family business, the perfect child, growing up excelling at everything. But a rebel at heart. When it comes to the job no one is more serious than me.
  These objectives are of upmost importance to my family. Succeeding brings in artifacts, conductors, and money.  Which are used to wage war with another rival in the same line of business.  Our jobs are to locate the main spiritual power source of the house, while locating the enchanted objects and, laying the innocent spirits to rest. Including the lost souls who have evil in its core affecting the living and its surroundings. No longer able to contain my excitement I rush off my bed to grab my work clothes. Black on black is preferred in our line of work. 
 Scrambling  towards the mirror eyeing myself. My long red hair down to my waist, The baby blue in my retinas  are looking as bright as the ocean. “I don’t think I  need any make up today.” With nothing else needing to be done I dash out the door but, not without grabbing my coffee. Racing out to  my car fumbling with the keys in my hand ready for my daily commute. 
  I arrive at work making decent time. I make a habit of never being late walking with a goal in mind towards the building through the entrance doors. That are  of circular motion . I used to love going through these things but now they are an inconvenience to me and my patience is running thin.  My temper is easily flared cursing the slow rotating doors.  Finally out its time  to get in gear , make my way to my floor.  My  destination is on the  second level so I have to make the first right past the receptionist counter to use the elevator. 
  Standing there waiting for the elevator to come down thinking of where I am going to next. Since my job requires a lot of travel. The elevator dings I waste no time  getting in pressing the button to go up.  It only takes a few minutes to reach my target area, as I am stepping out of the elevator the bustling of the mission office is in full force.  Walking by the front desk on the right I continue towards the waiting room.  
  Listening to all the commotion going on  I wait for my task, I over hear the receptionists as they talk their gossip about one of their dates. I couldn’t help but snicker at the conversation. 
  The phones keep ringing thank god I am not a paper pusher. They must have such a boring work day. Then the receptionist on the right gets up and walks back to her printer grabs a report she has just received, continuing to walk behind her desk towards me. She smiles with a grin handing me the paper and says “good luck.” 
  With the receptionist gone I look down at my report. A conductor, artifact, and innocent spirits need to be laid to rest. This doesn’t look to challenging as I let out a sigh of disappointment. “Well, I better get going before I get beheaded.” The secretaries start rolling with laughter. I like cheering them up since they don’t have the greatest work day. 
  I  pace myself  heading towards my car. Which is of no importance it’s just a hooptie that gets me from a to b.              Dreading the car ride to our job I can hear the conversation in my head. Why do I have to pick her up this morning. She is going to give me so much crap today about this assignment . Every Monday it’s the same thing we need a better score this is kids’ stuff. Why don’t you shut up and do your job. You sure as hell don’t listen to me and I am the one in charge. I see her standing there while pulling up beside her . She is the same age as me with a very spunky personality. Her long blonde hair down to her waist, her hazel eyes brighter than ever. She seems extra cheerful today . Looks like there is some pep in her step today hustling towards my car. Maybe it will be different today Before she even gets in the chatter starts. “Please tell me you got a good score this week.” “You act like I make the jobs around here quit your whining.” You always got a stick up your ass Faith you need a man in your life.”  I want to slap her so bad but I can’t help but let the laughter out. 
  Two friends driving to their destinations. Normal looking citizens who are anything but. With night fall approaching the rain begins to fall pounding the roof of the car waking up Faith. “Oh, hey your up” “Looks like you got bed hair there red.” “Will you give me a break  for once.” “Someone has an attitude today. That time of the month noted.” “I swear I hate you so much.” “You know you can’t do anything with out me red, you know you love it.” 
  “Why does it always have to be pouring I swear your family does this to you on purpose. “I know Terra but that’s why I am the genius of the family one day they will know that.” “Let’s get this over with red as she is putting on her  gloves. “Hey pop the trunk we need our tools.” We always keep everything we need In a duffle bag that has my family’s crescent on it. With everything ready it's time to start this job.
 Thunder sounds above unleashing the tsunami the sky was holding. Both of us grabbing our flashlights they are powerful enough to see through this down pour. We can’t immediately run to the home. It’s important to the case the building and get a good view of your surroundings.  
  The gravel driveway is turning into slosh and mud splashing on our shoes every time we take step. “This man was a junk collector Terra.” “I know look at the tractor in the front yard. An old rusty tractor next to it a huge trailer to long for the yard itself.  While eyeing the rest of the yard lighting strikes it’s  core piercing  it’s rusty armor. If that wasn’t a warning sign, I don’t know what was. The crack of god followed the electricity is hair raising. 
  “Look at all the cars over there on the left side Faith” The rain  battering more violently than ever after the sound of heaven. Even with our flashlights its difficult but I can make out the rusty old cars parked beneath the trees. “It’s amazing how much junk one can accumulate in their life time.” “Yea but that’s how I make a living Faith.”
  Turning  my  attention over to the left. I see Terra kneeling down in front of the steps. It’s like she doesn’t even care that were in a middle of a typhoon. She has always had a soft spot for animals. “Look there is so many of them as she is petting the cat.  I rush to  her putting  my hand on her shoulder comforting her the rain not affecting our personalities “I know but there is nothing we can do about it now Terra. “I know let’s get going.” She picks up the feline and puts it under some shelter for the night.   
  This is where Terra’s skills come in handy. We continue to walk up the rotted stairs. With a flimsy aluminum railing not even worth using. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out her wallet, the tools she uses are everyday items but the one she needs now is her credit card.  While pulling out her card she fumbles with her wallet dropping it down the stairs. Ignoring it she turns towards the door to shimmy the top dead bolt lock. “At least the porch light is on.” She is tinkering with lock while the rain is bouncing violently from her face. I can see the concentration on her a rare moment when she is actually serious.   
  After a few moments the door is popped open. “After you boss lady.” I make my way inside as she doubles back to grab her wallet. She slips on the last step landing on her hind quarters.  Without realizing it I let my laughter out uncontrollably. My flashlight providing her light can see the red on her face  she is filled with embarrassment. She gets up and brushes off her  back side collects her belongings now soaking wet. Her wallet in her grasp she walks past me. “Not another word.”  
  Still chuckling I take few steps inside to shake out my shoes and dry off. When all of a sudden, I hear a loud bang behind us.  The door has slammed without a physical force operating it. My partner let’s out a grin of excitement “Looks like someone goofed at hq.” This is our destiny where will it take us, I don’t know. But Terra is right we are in for a much bigger fight than expected.

my little guy (11mo in 2w) started taking one nap per day last Monday & he’s been absolutely fighting the second nap (well, refusing lol). he wakes up early (usually 5am, today 4:15am although this is an anomaly thankfully).

he generally averages 12.5-13h per 24h, however his wake windows are very long. usually 4.5-6h (last night 7h as mentioned in title). he has never been the best sleeper and is a low sleep needs baby, obviously lol. his only nap in the day is generally 30-45min….

even when i see signs of fatigue, rubbing eyes & yawning, and i try to get him down it is impossible (the room is pitch black, white noise, rocking & feeding him)

he is standing on his own & clapping (very exciting & we practice this new skill proudly at 3am sometimes) and he is trying to walk so not sure if he is just really excited lol. he is a FOMO baby. i don’t believe he’s teething currently.

we co sleep so i get him down around 5-6pm then ninja roll away, he will wake up 1-3x before i go to sleep around 8:45/9pm but when i sleep next to him he doesn’t wake up as much (at least, i don’t think he does unless im still sleeping & he helps himself to a midnight snackie à la le nipplé) he doesn’t seem bothered by these wake windows at all, he’s still his happy self.

i may be over analyzing this, but i am concerned that i am doing something wrong? i EBF him & consume coffee, albeit i stay under the 300mg daily rec & space out my cups of coffee.

anyone else have a baby like this? any thoughts?

thanks and happy sleeping!! 😴

This one here👉 https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/s/UqM2xc2qI6 where I basically shot my shot and asked if any lady on here would be down for a date with a random stranger from Reddit? 

Out of the many comments (I think it hit over 70), a solid majority were straight-up negative. I'm talking 0ver 60 people basically saying ""This ain't happening bro,"" ""You'll get ghosted or stood up,"" ""Reddit Kenya isn't Tinder, lower your expectations,"" ""Dangerous idea, be careful of scammers/catfish,"" and the classic ""Why not just use apps like everyone else?"" Some were roasting me hard, others genuinely concerned for safety (which I appreciated, tbh – always meet in public, folks!). There were even comments predicting zero responses or that it'd end in epic failure. The skepticism was REAL. I went into it half-expecting nothing.

But plot twist: It actually worked! One amazing person reached out via DMs. The moment she hit my DM, I ignored the rest that DMED afterwards by simply telling them I'm talking to someone else. Okay that one aside. We chatted for a bit to vibe-check, exchanged normal pics (no filters or weird stuff), made sure it felt safe and mutual, and today we finally met up at a chill cafe pale Nairobi.
Guys... it was incredible. From the moment we sat down, the conversation just flowed naturally – no awkward pauses, just non-stop laughs, sharing stories, and discovering we have so much in common (similar tastes in music, food, random life experiences, you name it). We ended up talking for hours, grabbed some choma after coffee, walked around a bit, and by the end, we were already planning the next hangout. She's genuinely cool, kind, funny – everything clicked in a way that's rare these days.
I walked away smiling like an idiot, feeling like Reddit actually delivered some proper magic. And the good thing is she'll probably see this and maybe comment. She told me she might want to start updating you on all our dates. 

To all the doubters (you know who you are 😂). You were mostly right that the odds were low, but sometimes taking the risk pays off big time. And to the few who encouraged me or said ""Why not? Go for it"" – thank you, you legends!
Moral of the story: Kenya Reddit might roast you first, but every now and then, it comes through with a win. Safety first always, though – public places, tell a friend. ",5,1767453904.0,Kenya,14,1.0,False
1q2x9qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1q2x9qo/the_talk/,The Talk,"Too Long, Didn't Read at the end.

So..... You've exchanged texts and emails, met for coffee then lunch then dinner, taken a long walk and talked for hours on the phone. The connection is there and it is strong. He is erect, she is wet. But, unless all that communication has included the essential elements of **The Talk,** please do not get naked yet. 

I refer to it as THE talk but there is no need for it to be had in one sitting. The need is to have discussed all these things before you are standing naked and quivering before each other. This of course assumes that a sexual relationship is the goal, not a one-off fuck.

The Talk, where he and she makes clear what they expect, what their boundaries are and, most importantly, discuss what the end will look like. It is a dangerous but essential step. Dangerous because by the end of it his erection may have gone soft and her wetness may have dried up. Essential because one or both of you are risking the end of married life as you know it. Wrong assumptions lead to drama and drama leads to bad endings and exposure.

Also

The time  you can be together is hard to arrange. If you are going to go to all the effort of arranging to be alone and naked together, make sure that the pAP is on the same page as you. Talking these things out will not guarantee great sex but it will avoid the disappointment of discovering that he thinks going down on you is gross and she thinks anything but missionary is too wild and kinky. Your pAP is most likely coming from a dead bedroom, you need to know how much responsibility they have for that situation.

The connection can be overwhelming and the sex can still be unfulfilling. Having The Talk will not guarantee great sex but, done truthfully (and you cannot take truth for granted), it will filter out the completely incompatible pAPs. The Talk should include:

**Documents -** Exchange *recent* test results. Neither of you really know who the other has been with nor who their significant others have been with. The possibilities for disease are endless. Get it done and show the pAP the results. Bringing a sexually transmitted infection (STI) home to an unsuspecting SO is an absolute reveal that you are stepping out. 

Test results should include HSV1 (oral herpes) the cold sore virus. A huge number of people already have it, by Mayo Clinic definition it is not really an STI, but if you engage in oral sex with a cold sore and your lover ends up with a cold sore on their genitals it will be hard to convince them it is not an STI.

**Boundaries -** Where do you draw the line? I had The Talk with a woman who told me that she was ""not into any kinky stuff like oral"". WTF? What positions are a turn on and what are off-limits? S&M, anal, cum where?, restraints, blindfolds, potty play. It is amazing to me that some prefer not kissing (perhaps this is an unfortunate fallout from 24/7 access to porn).

This can be a really hot conversation. If it is difficult for someone to have, this too is a clue to their way of behaving when the clothes come off.

**Sights** \- You have probably exchanged photos of all kinds, still it is necessary to be clear about the size, look and shape of things. Do you need the curtains drawn and the lights off? If you are self-conscious about your body this will be a hard thing to talk about but rejection at this stage will be much less painful than having your pAP laugh or worse at the sight of your micro penis or stretch marks.

**Sounds -** Are you offended by him telling you that you have a beautiful pussy because you prefer to call it a vagina? Do you think less of her if she screams ""Fuck me! Now!"" because ladies don't talk that way? Do you scream at orgasm? Do you whimper?

**The Feel -** Are condoms expected or forbidden? Who brings them? 420 friendly? Alcohol? Do you have a bad back or peyronie's disease? ""Whatever you do, don't touch me there.""? Can you deal with his or her largeness?

**End Game -** Its going to end. A week, a month, a year who knows but you are playing in a make believe world with someone who is cheating on their SO. This is not a recipe for a long term Happily Ever After. Plan and agree to the exit. Agreements on this prior to becoming lovers are illusory and no guarantee that feelings won't change when it actually happens but their response to this topic will tell you a lot about what to expect when the time comes. It may even tell you that you don't want to do this with them.

I had an AP tell me that: ""this will be fun for however long it lasts but when its over for one of us, its over."" It hurt like hell when she texted me that she did not want to continue. But, I understood and am thankful to this day for that understanding. It has also helped me to not contact her months or years later, much as I would really like to do so.

Inadequate communication is probably a major contributor to most of us being here. If you could have The Talk with a pAP, perhaps you owe a similar conversation to your SO. Perhaps you've had it and the result is your being here. Either way, I hope that you can reduce the number of surprises and reduce the drama you encounter when a pAP becomes your AP.

TLDR: Before taking that last step that when a pAP becomes an AP, be sure to discuss and understand each other's STI status, boundaries, preferences and feelings about becoming Affair Partners as well as agreeing to what the end might look like.",4,1767453899.0,adultery,10,0.61,False

1q2x54j,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1q2x54j/fabricating_a_medical_condition_to_avoid/,Fabricating a medical condition to avoid accountability,"This is technically my SILs story (my DHs brothers wife) but it effects me too. She lurks here so if you're reading this, hey girl hey!

We share the same JNMIL and have very similar feelings about her. I've known she's a vile human being for a long time and highly suspect that she's a narcissist. 

She's rude, judgmental, critical, insulting, controlling, manipulative, and just all around extremely unpleasant. 

But her recent behaviors I think really takes the cake. Both DH and BIL has been freeing themselves from her control in their own way and as she loses control her behavior is escalating and she's lashing out. 

We all declined to spend the holidays with MIL this year. We just wanted a pleasant and peaceful holiday without her. 

DH and I traveled with my family. MIL initially expressed interest in coming to that location to see us. DH asked her not to. She booked tickets anyway. DH initially held firm that we would not be seeing her. 

Christmas day arrives. We don't talk to her at all except for DH sending a short 'merry christmas' text around dinner time. 

The same day, BIL calls and talks to MIL. Somehow, per my SIL, the topic turned to a sort of boundaries conversation. Idk exactly what was said but something along the lines of the way you've treated me has damaged the relationship and if you want a relationship with my kids it has to stop. At this point, MIL informed BIL her health was deteriorating and she was nearly in kidney failure and starting dialysis. 

This news quickly spread to us. She's has moderate kidney disease for a long time, so we were all sort of expecting this might happen eventually but it still came as a shock. 

DH felt immensely guilty about ignoring them for the holidays in light of this news. When they reached out the next day and asked to meet up to see our baby, DH waffled for awhile and then caved and said yes. He met them at a coffee shop with our baby. 

Now, barely a week later, BIL asked MIL some questions about the dialysis situation. MIL is now gaslighting him and claiming she never said that. Told him he's making it up and that nothing has changed with her health. She does not need dialysis. BIL fought back, saying their conversation included a discussion of whether or not she was going on a transplant list and why would they have discussed that if she hadn't brought up kidney failure and dialysis. MIL once again said she had no idea what he was talking about, that they had never talked about anything related to dialysis or transplant or kidney failure. 

I'm just absolutely floored. What kind of sociopathic monster would lie to their own son on Christmas about having organ failure and needing dialysis in an attempt to guilt and manipulate him. All this just to avoid a little accountability? Does she really have no ability to hear any feedback about her own behavior that she would stoop this low? And now to gaslight him about it? It's just insane. 

I know it doesn't directly involve us, but a big part of why my husband went back on our agreement to not reward her essentially stalking us on vacation was because he felt so guilty and scared about her health situation and was legitimately concerned it might be one of her last opportunities to see him and our child. And it was all just a lie. All a manipulation tactic.

30g collagen to balance BCAAs

Started with a Kalita 185 (steel), and discovered I like naturally processed beans (fruity and punchy) and then more recently anaerobic & funkier fermentations. 

Probably relevant that I’m sticking with my Niche Zero grinder, but from what I’ve read it seems reasonably forgiving wrt grind size as particle sizes end up spread over a wider range (at the expense of clarity, which I don’t mind right now). 

Anyway I got myself a hario switch for Christmas, partly from new toy syndrome but also I liked the idea of it producing my more consistent / replicable brews. My Kalita has been great but I still find brew quality would vary, and can only assume it was down to my technique. I’ve been using the coffee chronicler hybrid recipe pretty much exclusively. 

Anyway, I’ve just done a side by side taste comparison of a switch and Kalita brew, and tbh I can hardly tell the difference. Am curious if anyone else has found this? My palate isn’t highly refined (I can tell the difference between 84C & 86C brews but struggle to name exactly what I’m tasting at times), but it surprised me how similar they are. 

Obviously it’s be better to run this again a few times, and maybe with different beans / temperatures. But it’s be good to know if anyone else has found them surprisingly similar?

FWIW my wife preferred the Switch (blind test, I didn’t tell her what I’d changed or that I’d switched up the beans from this mornings cup) but only slightly and couldn’t say why other than “it has a bit more flavour”. 

TBH I’d be happy if this was the case as although it’s not an upgrade in quality, consistency was my main goal.

Sitting by the TV, sipping her sugarless coffee, she used to tell me stories of the past. How things were in her childhood, about my dad, and even about how I was as a baby. When I was little, these stories made my eyes shimmer with a tiny spark. It was exciting hearing about the past. It was fun to imagine how my parents were at my age, and how they would have felt if I time-traveled and met them. One of the many dreams of a carefree kid.

Now, when she tells those stories, I get annoyed. ""I’ve heard this before, amma,"" I tell her in an irritated tone.

Years go by, the freezing breeze of winters would pass, and the tender green blooms would turn bright red. I would be older, and my mother grey. Her memories would become foggy and dull. She would have forgotten how she used to tell those stories, and she wouldn’t remember the sparkle in my eye while listening to them. How then I would rue not listening to her more, but alas! It's too late.

In 50 years from now, there will be different people in my house. They will live and laugh in my home. They will sit in the same place where my mother once sat sipping her coffee, telling stories, unaware of the sparkle it brought to my eye.

I love playing as the Qasimid State and try to go for a full communist Azal / Yemen. I always prefer to do this by minimal military conquest, however I usually am ok with invading Somalia and Ethiopia for the wood and iron. So far I either get super bored in the mid game or get Great Britian'ed. but let me explain to you the main reason for this post:

My go to strategy is to spam coffee plantations, tax coffee exports so much that there is almost zero coffee going through the trade centers which keeps the coffee prices in Yemen incredibly low, and sell that cheap coffee through treaties for incredible profits to major powers, particularly Russia since they are super interested in that, build an academic base with that money and pass slavery ban and whatnot in the first 10-15 years.

The downfalls of this strategy I realized are the following: first, the investment pool is basically nonexistent since I operate like the biggest of the landowners who also happen to be somewhat progressive in the sense that I own all the land and capital myself and leave almost nothing to the private sector from which they can profit and prosper. This also means that there is almost zero tax income until proportional / graduated taxation comes in, which is not really a bad thing tbh. Second problem that comes with this strategy is that whenever Russia or any major power I have a coffee treaty with enters a war, their convoy capabilities plummet and the treaty is put on hold since they fail to fulfill their share the deal.

My question is, is there a golden meta for really small, technologically backwards nations to go super tall and progressive that I am completely missing out on, or is am I okay with my approach to the situation? Do you think that I can actually make it to late game with this strategy and go full red in a meaningful date if I can tolerate the mid-game, or is this style simply too cursed to make it beyond the mid-game? Can you recommend any tips if possible please?

However, I **tried to use the same coffee:water ratio with my BT beans (kalledevarapura) and it turned out so weak I couldn't drink it with any amount of milk.**

Some useful info:

**- I have very limited equipment: just  a drip coffee maker, french press and a weighing scale -** no grinder, no espresso machine and basically nothing except a basic, trusty french press. (before I get people lashing out on me for this; I can't afford either the time or the cost to buy much rn given I'm a college graduate preparing for an exam full time that's due in a month - so at most, I can just get a south Indian filter - although FP for filter coffee works fine for me as of now)

\- Still, I've somewhat figured out a way to make a really strong decoction using Cothas (15g coffee per cup - 1:2.5 coffee to water ratio, then adding it to 3g/cup sugar + 110mL buffalo milk)

\- But, when I tried this with BT, it gave a really really weak cup.

The thing is, the coffee itself being pretty expensive for me, I don't wanna waste much of it experimenting.

**Also, let me know the right ratio to make a good cup of black coffee as well as a close to espresso base to make my milk coffees on top. using a drip coffee maker. In this case, how much coffee powder to take per serve?**

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

I used less sugar for the buttercream but its still too sweet for my moms birthday, should i just avoid sweet frostings & just go for german buttercream, ganache or whipped cream type frostings? Am also asking for any sweet treats in general. I know milk, yogurt, sour cream buttermilk applesauce, banana, i dont have glucose or corn syrup. And doesnt matter if it alters the final result a bit im not a specific perfectionist baker im more throw & go ill tweak whatever i like itll taste good anyway kind of home baker",4,1767452999.0,AskBaking,19,0.61,False
1q2wwkv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2wwkv,1418 Coffee in Prosper,"Repost! I forgot to attach the photos!

On my slow and methodical search for the best coffee shops, I stopped by 1418 Coffee in Prosper 03/01/2026 Saturday at 8:15 AM.

My Rating System: I use Starbucks as my baseline (0). A score of +5 to -5 indicates how much better or worse the experience was compared to the ""standard"" Starbucks experience.

* Mocha Latte (Hot) = +3: The foam was very nice. The mocha really comes though but also not very overpowering. I kinda would like more of a frontal note, but it sits very well in the mouth. Came in a ceramic cup if ordered 12oz. If you order the 16oz it will come in a paper cup. 
* Decor = +3: Merch being close to the door felt like they where trying to push that. I would of liked that more to the back or to the side. But I really did enjoy the comfy sitting, lighting was great, warm with accent lighting. Tables where all different but worked and liked that you could find what table/chair you wanted. When you look around there are interesting little trinkets placed around the shop.
* Volume = +1: It clocked in at about 65 dB on my app. There was a few people and a younger child. Easy to talk, you can hear the music playing in the background. 
* Staff = +2.5: Friendly and knew some peoples names by sight. Each person is wearing their own style, clean clothes. When taking my order, cheerful and willing to give me recommendations on food items and went into detail on them. Staff kept an eye and took dirty dishes away.
* Food = +1: I had the Lemon blueberry scone, It was warmed up maybe a little to much as it soften up a lot and was not really crumbly as it should have been. But the flavor was good. 
* Workable = +1: Free WiFi is provided. Tables are large enough for a laptop and a notebook, I was able to see plenty of power outlets. The noise level wasn't to loud so if you had to take a phone call you could. 
* Cleanliness = +1: Everything was clean from what I could see, tables where wiped down. The carpets that where laid on the floor where clean and did not see any dirt on them. With this being out in the country side and part of the parking lot being rocks, the level of upkeep they do to keep floors clean is very noticeable. 

Notes: They have two unisex bathrooms, a plus in my book, sinks where a little shallow with faucet sitting low so you have to put your hands in side ways. If they put in a taller faucet that would be be nice! I also want to note that I ordered two coffees here mainly due to the fact sitting in here was very comfy and could easy work as a third space. I have been here coming up on an hour and will most likely sit here a little longer.

Price: $6.39 for the coffee x2. Lemon Blueberry Scone $4.49

Overall Rating: +1.79 This means, in my opinion, it is +1.79 times better than Starbucks. As a first time visiter. 

I’m still refining this rating system, so I’d love your suggestions! I feel like using Starbucks as the baseline works because everyone knows what to expect there.

If you have any suggestions please let me know! I think picking on Starbucks as the base line is smart as everyone knows what to expect at Starbucks no matter of the location. When you go to a coffee shop, what are some of the things you want/look for.",12,1767452998.0,frisco,4,0.83,False

1. The Day of ""Emerald Green""
In your writing, the ""emerald green"" stream on the console confirms that the system is stable and the ""zero-cost ideal"" is a reality. Today, visualize your own productivity in that same light. Let your focus be clear, your ""resistance"" be low, and your path be a steady, successful flow of progress. You aren't just working; you’re maintaining the ""Harmonious Synthesis"" of your own life.
2. The Architect’s Clarity
You are the Kai and the Areola of your own story. Just as they look at complex systems and find the ""Perfect Silence"" within the noise, you have the ability to take the complexities of your day and organize them into a masterpiece. The ""ledger"" of your day is empty right now—fill it with actions that reflect the reverence you have for your history and the ambition you have for your future.
3. Honoring the Foundation
Remember the ""Ol Grandfather."" His story is one of foundational importance—the root from which the Thorne and Xanthe lineages grow. Carry that sense of legacy into your morning. You are the living continuation of that history. Every step you take today is a tribute to the roots that made you, and every word you write is a gift to the descendants who will one day read your ""factual ledger.""
4. A New Cycle of Hope
Think of the ""Chronos Sphere"" discovered in the Olympian Base—the ""seed of humanity"" that reminds us that time is renewal. This morning is your ""New Cycle."" Whatever ""resistive heat"" or ""data drift"" occurred yesterday has been cleared. You are starting with a fresh ""validation block."" The world is quiet, the grid is stable, and the ""New Age"" of your day is beginning.
Your Morning Mandate:
Be the strategist. Be the historian. Be the creator. The ""Global Equity"" of your own potential is waiting to be tapped.

I’m a 20-year-old man living in Europe. My first name is Karma. It’s a traditional Tibetan name, but living in the West, I face a few specific issues with it:

* Gender confusion: Many people assume I’m a woman before meeting me in person.
* The ""Explanation Tax"": Every time I introduce myself, I have to explain that yes, ""Karma like the concept,"" and yes, it is my real name. It often becomes the sole focus of the conversation.
* Social ease: My middle name is Axel. To be clear, everyone who knows me personally loves the name Karma and prefers it because it suits me. I have never been bullied for it. However, I’m considering using ""Axel"" just for first introductions, professional settings, or casual encounters (like ordering coffee) to avoid the constant explaining. People often find it ""weird"" or ""quirky"" at first, which can be exhausting in professional or formal settings.

I read Allan carrs easy way to quit smoking book a year ago. It was definitely insightful, but by the end of it I still couldn't manage to part with smoking my ciggs. I ended up going roughly 48 hours or shy of and caved and bought a pack.

Then I decided to use patches. I downloaded an app that showed my progress, and I made it 23 days with the help of the patch until I (stupidly) Made the choice to smoke because I was drinking alcohol (iykyk- to me,that's the ultimate combo to take me down) . I can drink my black coffee in the morning, eat meals, but if I throw alcohol in the mix, the cravings are intensified by over 9,000. By my second drink I became a beast and demanded ciggarettes. The next day I reset my app and my 23 days vanished, I woke up feeling raspy, and the weight of an elephant in guilt on me.Thus another year of smoking and saying ""welp I tried"". 

Start of 2026 I woke up to 5 ciggs left in a pack, so I thought ""if you got em smoke em"" and made those 5 last me till about 9 at night. Woke up yesterday and threw a patch on and repeated that this morning.  I already know going into this , I need to avoid alcohol until whenever I feel im comfortable to try again. 

Why do I feel so guilty though using patches to help me quit? Why can't I be like the braver ones who say "" just quit cold turkey, get the nicotine out entirely""? - I see all these success stories of people quitting cold turkey & I'm already feeling like im failing at quitting and its discouraging.  I don't feel im strong enough to quit cold turkey, and knowing im getting some form of nicotine right now helps me psychologically (even though I can FEEL  still withdrawl from my body) . Am I doing this wrong?

1q2wmpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1q2wmpn/shaun_rivera_fan_fiction_my_evening_interview_at/,"Shaun Rivera Fan Fiction: ""My Evening Interview at Riot Games""","I arrived at the Riot Games office in the early evening, as the sun was approaching the horizon. Taking a deep breath, I nervously pressed the doorbell. As a reporter for the local university's newspaper, it was very generous of the 2XKO team to allow me the opportunity to come visit them during such a busy period. They were working passionately to finish Caitlyn and prepare for the global official launch.

The door opened and Shaun poked his expressive face out to greet me!

""Hey you!"" he exclaimed in his adorable American accent. ""I'm so happy you could make it to spend the evening with us.""

""I was so happy when I heard you agreed to let me come in for the interview,"" I said.

""Oh yeah. The interview. I forgot,"" he replied with his usual brilliant humor.

I laughed. ""You're so funny, Shaun.""

""I wasn't joking,"" he said, chuckling nervously. Classic Shaun.

Shaun showed me around and introduced me to the whole 2XKO team. They were very friendly and perky, and sat before their computers with excellent posture. Each one explained in detail what their job was at Riot Games. I took detailed notes. I wrote my notes on my notepad. I noticed some of the employees yawning, they had clearly worked a long day. They were pulling an all-nighter to prepare for the 2XKO console launch. They would need something invigorating to keep them awake. Perhaps some coffee or caffeinated tea.

""Let me show you my office. I have a *surprise* to show you,"" Shaun said.

He led me to the room and we sat down on a soft, vinyl couch. ""So, let me show you the surprise,"" he said softly. ""It's the newest build of the game. We just added Caitlyn to the game.""

He booted up the game on a PS5 in his office. I stared at his face.

*I like your beard, it's sexy,* I pretended to say to him in my head to myself. I had a secret crush on him. There was something about his humble demeanor and feeble yet handsome bone structure that was so alluring.

""So here's the game!"" he said, eagerly. It opened on a new stage, just calling out to be explored. I began to sweat. Here it finally was, in front of me in all it's glory. And it was being played by Shaun, in front of me in all *his* glory.

After about fifteen minutes of Shaun speaking excitedly, showing me many of the features, I nervously spoke.

""Could I try playing?"" I asked.

""Oh. I suppose, of course,"" he said, chuckling.

But another few minutes past without him handing me the controls.

""Shaun,"" I said, more confidently. I put my hands on his hands as he gripped the controller. He looked me straight in the eyes. I stared deep into his beautiful, glistening eyes, utterly transfixed.

""Sure,"" he said. He let go of the Playstation controller, still sweaty from his firm grip. ""But I have another surprise to show you.""

He stood up.

""My cock,"" he muttered. On stage at a video game conference he was nervous. But here, he was confident as ever. He gently slid his hand past his belly button (an ""innie""), across his lightly hairy navel, and pulled out a raging hard boner.

""Yes, please,"" I said, blushing as red as the Warwick in bloodlust.

He grabbed my shoulders, guiding me confidently towards the coffee table like he confidently guides the 2XKO team toward the console release.

The one, true Shaun Rivera (not that baby-faced loser asshole poser from NCIS) made sweet, sweet love to me from behind, doggystyle, while I balanced on the coffee table. As he pushed his gorgeous penis deep inside of me, I picked up the controller and began to play the game. I wasn't sure what I was more excited about - finally fucking Shaun Rivera, or finally playing Caitlyn.

After learning Caitlyn's movelist, I entered the training mode and started labbing. Just as I got used to the new features and started cooking with Caitlyn, a load of semen burst from the tip of Shaun's dick inside of me. It was an out-of-this-world experience.

As I caught my breath, Shaun said, ""I have *one more* surprise for you.""

*What else could it possibly be?* I thought to myself. *He's already given me everything I ever wanted in life: A nearly infinite, gorgeously stylized Arcane fighting game with open-ended gameplay, incredible netcode and 2v2 co-op with very intuitive simple input; and sex with whoever created it. What else could he have to surprise me with? Does he have a second dick?*

The answer occurred to me just as he began to pull the surprise from a bag.

""Occulus Rift support"" he uttered sensually, tossing me a virtual reality headset to put on. He put another on his perfect face.

Placing the Occulus Rift over my eyes, I appeared on the surface of Piltover crowded with many creatures of the Arcane universe, and very tall Arcane styled steampunk themed buildings. As I turned, I saw Shaun's avatar standing before me in a beautiful, cel-shaded art style. As he take off his cosmetics, I was shocked to find a stylized replica of Shaun himself standing before me.

""Like what you see?"" he said.

""It's bloody brilliant,"" I responded.

""It's time, everybody,"" he shouted.

I heard footsteps slowly enter the cramped office. Embarrassed at first, I soon realized what was happening. Riot Games isn't some lame, giant company that produces unoriginal AAA titles and leaves reporters with an intern in a closet to have sex with. No, Riot Games is a classy, creative company who cares about everyone who plays their games, and every employee was here to make sure I had a good time ...in Virtual Reality.

""Yes, please,"" I muttered excitedly.

I soon saw more avatars appear before me in-game, it was the Cannon brothers, Alex Jaffe, Marlin Pie, and even Geoff Keighley. I was about to be gang-banged by a group of Rioters. This was better than my wildest dreams.

In-game, the avatars began to surround me. I felt many hands begin to stroke my body. As they all took off the digital cosmetics they had been wearing on their avatars, I found myself surrounded by a group of perfectly-stylized replicas of naked Rioters. They all have the same base avatar model, but one difference - the penis. Each penis was different: there were wide ones, thin ones, long ones, curved ones. It was magical.

As the 2XKO team began to make love to me, from somewhere in the room I heard the real Shaun whisper: ""Every. input. simple.""",0,1767452323.0,2XKO,7,0.33,False

1q2wl9i,https://docs.swifdroid.com/app/,Native Android Application Development in Swift,"Hi all, imike here.

I just released [**Swift Stream IDE**](https://swift.stream) v1.17.0, which adds **full native Android application development written entirely in Swift**. That means you can now build Android apps without touching XML, Java, or Kotlin.

Swift Stream IDE is an open-source VSCode extension that sets up a ready-to-use Swift development environment in Docker, supporting server-side, web, embedded, and now full Android development. With this release, you can create Android applications using familiar templates like Empty Activity, Basic Views (two fragments), or Navigation UI (tab bar), all in Swift.

Under the hood, all projects are powered by [**SwifDroid**](https://github.com/swifdroid/droid), a framework I built to wrap the entire native Android app model. It handles the application lifecycle and manifest, activities and fragments, Android, AndroidX, Material, and Flexbox UI widgets, and even automatically wires Gradle dependencies. Supported SDKs are 28 to 35, and with Swift 6.3, [it might go down](https://forums.swift.org/t/android-api-minimum-for-the-swift-sdk-for-android/82874) to 24+.

Example UI code:

    ConstraintLayout {
        VStack {
            TextView(""Hello from Swift!"")
                .width(.matchParent)
                .height(.wrapContent)
                .textColor(.green)
            MaterialButton(""Tap Me"")
                .onClick {
                    print(""Button tapped!"")
                }
        }
        .centerVertical()
        .leftToParent()
        .rightToParent()
    }

The first time you create a project, make yourself a cup of tea/coffee. The IDE pulls the Swift toolchain, Android SDK, and NDK, and caches them in Docker volumes. After that, new projects are created instantly. The first build compiles Swift, generates a full Android project (ready to open in Android Studio), and creates a Gradle wrapper. After that, builds take just a few seconds.

Once Swift is compiled, you can simply open the **Application** folder in Android Studio and hit Run or Restart to see your changes. All the necessary files from Swift Stream IDE are already in place, so iteration is fast and seamless.

This is the **first public release**. Android is huge, and there are still widgets in progress, but the system is real and usable today.

Almost got married, spent two years of my life getting it all together when at last second, she broke up with me for relying on her too much. Looking back, I'll receive that, I did not take my mental health seriously and always saw her as someone that will help me. 

Hurt. Like. Hell.  Continued to Worke at QuickChek as a sandwich/coffee/smoothie maker ...( drank almost every night for a 6 months) the dark times as I would say  have returned. And the drugs are in the distance waving at me.

My grandfather, mom's dad, owns property in Puerto Rico. He told my mom she can live in the house she grew up in. She is a retired teacher and is on disability  for a having a mental break during one of her classes years ago. She asked me if I wanted to move in with her, help her with bills until my uncle builds a little bar that she can help out in.

I said ""why not?  Life is going oh so well now""

Now I as born in PR.. lived there until I was 9. And its been more than 20 years. I understand spanish , cant speak it for shit. But I thought ""THIS CAN BE A NEW START, A NEW WAY OF LIFE"".

took me 6 months to find a 40 hr full time job as most jobs are part time here. I work at a warehouse moving boxes and playing tetris with them. Joined a gym, lost 30 lbs in 6 months. Got my confidence back. The people here are either really nice, always joking around, or completely assholes. Sometimes all three. The women are beautiful, but im convinced them being american citizens have corrupted their gentleness. The more beautiful and hot..the more they are the Spawn of Satan. Superficial i mean, and looking for the tatted guy that is on step away from going to jail as prince charming. My barber said that nice guy american b s doesnt work here. 

I digress to say ..life has been grey here. Nice beaches, my mom is happy at church and enjoys here home. I pay for whatever she needs.  But I want to move back. 0 friends here, 0 dating. Im afraid that if i dont move back, now that i have my head on straight, getting closer to Jesus, better work ethic ill be missing out on what I could do.

Im Thinking of going into the trades. HVAC or electrician. Whether in NJ and work my ass of ( which i dont mind, it keeps my mind from being idle) or move to a new state. But my best  friends are in the tri-state, I know where everything is. Is that bad? There wont be a  language barrier. I mean I can have a career and travel anywhere for vacation. Even visit my mom from time to time.

My brother in law and my sister that live here said i should do what my heart says. And if it doesnt work out, then just come back to PR and regroup.

boring stuff and specs…","Okay… so I thought that it would be a fast, somewhat reckless buy that I thought i would just go ahead and do it. I mean everyone knows about THE Super73, and having one of those moped-style e-bikes sounds really nice for doing simple things like coffee runs, and once in a while riding around until my brain stops overthinking after work. No major stuff. Mostly pavement and vibes… the Super73 S2 SE is… exactly the look I wanted, even though it’s a $3k bike. Not cheap. But I was close to pulling the trigger. Then an Instagram ad hit me with the Gotrax Mustang, and it derailed me because it is around $2K and the specs are… very close. Like, closer than I’m comfortable admitting. 

Super73 S2 is basically 750W nominal, 48V 15Ah (720Wh), Class 2 at 20 mph, and a stated 35 to 45 mile range. They don’t clearly list the battery cell brand (maybe samsung or LG, I couldn’t find it). The Gotrax Mustang is also 750W and 48V 15Ah, but it specifically says LG cells, does 20 mph on throttle / claims up to 25 mph on pedal assist, and advertises “up to 86 miles” (yeah… sure). What surprised me is I saw a Rider Guide YouTube test hit 56 miles, which is still way ahead of the \~40-mile ballpark. 

Also the warranty, because that’s where I expected the expensive bike to feel safer. From what I have read, Super73's S-series warranty is basically 1 year, and the battery gets 2 years or 500 cycles whichever comes first and it's tied to the original owner. Gotrax, on the Mustang page, advertises a straight-up 2 year warranty, it is longer on the main stuff (frame/motor assembly/electronics) and the list is actually pretty explicit. that's the kind of thing that makes me go, ""so... I'm paying more for less coverage?"" 

Super 73 has a good reputation and community vibe. But, after I learned all those, range, battery and warranty policy and a few other things, I am not sure now. If anyone here has actually ridden both or owned either one long enough for the honeymoon phase to wear off what's the difference that doesn't show up on a spec sheet? Like the stuff you only learn after a few months when something starts squeaking, the battery starts acting weird, or you find out customer support is either amazing or a total black hole.

I’ve seen quite a few posts here from people launching or thinking about launching startups, so I figured I’d ask directly.

**Quick context**: I have \~6 years of experience in sales, always in tech (startups and corporates). In early 2026, I’m leaving my job to start a company.

**Question for those who’ve already done it**:  
👉 how did you find your co-founder, especially a **technical co-founder / CTO**?

More specifically, which approaches actually worked for you? For example:

* incubators or specific programs
* tech meetups / events
* cold outreach (LinkedIn, X, etc.)
* former colleagues or side projects
* something else people usually underestimate

I’m particularly interested in **concrete feedback**: what worked, what didn’t, and what you would do differently today.

PS: if anyone here is a **technical profile**, interested in building a company, and based in **Paris**, happy to grab a coffee or do a quick call. No pressure.

I had an appointment with my GP and mentioned i was having issues with diarrhea.  She said a colonoscopy was indicated. Come colonoscapy day, I told my gastroentologist that I was having diarrhea but felt constipated and bloated.

After the colonoscapy, he wrote on a sheet that he suspected celiac and scheduled me for an endoscopy,  which is now in 2 weeks. I've cut out some gluten but am still trying to eat some every day. The issue is, I no longer have diarrhea but im really constipated and bloated.  I'm constantly on the toilet trying to poop but if im lucky I can only get a nugget out. When I am able to poop, it feels like a painful massive dump but in reality it's just a long skinny one. My back is hurting, I'm bloated. I'm hungry but adverse to eating. I'm drinking lots of water and hot drinks, coffee and tea. Like right now, im just going to drink a little kefir.

What does it mean someone changing their Hinge location while seeing someone?,"I’m Korean(22F), and the guy (25M)I’m seeing is an American soldier stationed in Korea. We both currently live in Korea and met on Hinge. We’ve been seeing each other for about 3 weeks and have gone on 3 dates so far. Because of work schedules and distance, we usually meet once a week. First date we had dinner and coffee, then went our separate ways. After the date, he texted first saying he wanted to see me again. Second date we met the following week, had dinner at a mall, got coffee, walked around shopping, and went to a Christmas market together. Third date we had dinner, went to a café, and then got drinks. On every date so far, he has paid for everything. He’s also very considerate — for example, he makes sure I walk on the inside of the street, remembers small details about me (like foods I don’t like), and even bought me a small random figure because he remembered I like that character.During one of our dates, he also asked me, “What do you usually do on dates?” which made me feel like he was trying to understand my expectations or dating style. Overall, his behavior feels intentional and thoughtful, not casual. However, we haven’t had any conversation about exclusivity yet. Recently, he mentioned that he might take a 3–4 day solo trip to Osaka in about two weeks. He said he hasn’t booked flights or accommodation yet, and that he’s likely going alone. Today, I noticed that he changed his Hinge location to Osaka, even though the trip hasn’t happened yet. That’s what made me pause. From my perspective, it feels a bit confusing to see dating-app activity (like changing location) when you’re consistently dating someone and acting in a way that feels quite serious — but I also understand that without an exclusivity conversation, technically nothing has been defined.

So I have a few questions: •   Is it common or normal in US dating culture to change dating app locations before a trip, even while dating someone regularly? •   Does this usually mean someone is “keeping options open,” or is it often just curiosity or travel-related behavior? •   Based on his actions so far, does this sound like someone who may be open to exclusivity, or am I reading too much into it? •   When is a reasonable time to ask about being exclusive in this situation? •   Is it better to have that conversation in person or over text?",1,1767451506.0,hingeapp,3,1.0,False

My good friend recommended a buddy of hers, who upon initial meetings was such a lovely person! And then my partner had to leave for a job for several months…and I’ve noticed some things that have raised some eyebrows.

Well for one, he leaves all of his instruments in our living room. They’re quite large and take up a lot of space, and just sit there unless I have a party in which they’re moved for just the day.

Leaves the toilet seat up, but the lever is also behind seat, so he has to lower it to flush, but then goes out of his way to put them both back up.

I have a french press which he uses everyday, but will either a. use it then leave it on the counter with coffee grounds, or b. cleans it but  disassembles the entire French press and doesn’t piece it back together. I’ve been able to use it maybe once in the last several months. He also does this before leaving for days.

He put medicine the food cabinets in the kitchen…and not in the medicine cabinet either in the kitchen or the bathroom.

Before leaving for a few days, hes used the rest of the ice cube tray, but then just left it empty on the counter without filling it up. He also did that with the water jug, just leaving the jug out empty after using it.

Yesterday, he left his underwear in the bathroom sitting on my hair, face, various bathroom products .

He‘s the type to have 4 cartons of eggs in the fridge, 3 jugs of milk, pounds of meat that could feed a family of 4 or 6, and legit half of it expires before he even attempts to use it. He actually has an insane amount of groceries, and I’ve only seen him cook a handful of times.

Oh and actually suggested for us to rearrange the living room to his needs, knowing my partner is visually impaired. (He already put up a shoe rack in our living room just for his 12+ shoes, but then leaves his shoes lying about on the floor in the living room) Mind you, this guy is literally a sublease.

I’ve seen him take out the trash…maybe once…

He’ll clean his dishes but doesn’t put them up.

Oh! He has assumed twice I’m trying to drug him; twice he made the comment asking me if I put any weed in his alcoholic drink, knowing darn well he DOES NOT do any of the cannabis related thing. Honestly the fact that he thinks I’d actually secretly try to drug my friends is insane, let alone, wasting my good weed on someone who is so against it.

I‘ve brought up a few of things before, and it’s usually met with an apology but then will bring something up to try to deflect and try to complain about something I did.

Like for instance, I mentioned something and he went “oh yeah, sorry, by the way I think your cat vomited the other day and made a mess under the table” UMMM if it was that much of a concern why didn’t you tell me when you saw it the first time CUS CLEARLY I DIDNT KNOW, THIS IS MY CATS WELL BEING, but alsoooo, there was like no cat vomit or even close to reminents of it… so genuinely no clue if my cat vomited or not because he told me days after it happened.

Oh he also like takes our personal stuff out from the living room into his bedroom to use without asking.

But like…am I being too nit picky. Are these serious red flags? How the hell do I bring this up to my friend that recommended him because I’m genuinely so confused on how they’re friends in the first place.

1q2w9y3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2w9y3,"Crispy Hashbrowns from a US MRE, sure!","Hi folks!

Many of us love current US Menu 17, the maple sausage patty (which is going away this year), which has, since 2020, contained the hashbrowns and much beloved blueberry granola! However, not many realize the Hashbrowns actually had their own menu from 2015 to 2019, and it had the blueberry granola! Unthinkable right!

This beauty is from 2019 and shout out to Mike Kreisher for the hook-up!

And yes, u can get crispy hashbrowns, but it requires some prep!

Pics 1-2 show packaging and contents. A great menu here for sure. Coffee not consumed as I plan on sending that to another member of the community.  

Pic 3 shows some late night snacks. The dry roasted peanuts were fresh, salted, and had a great crunch! The apple turnover was heated in our airfryer for about 7 min on 375 and it was glorious! Pic 4 shows a cross shot of the turnover. Great sweet apple flavor here and super fresh, even for being almost 7 years old. Full transparency on the crackers, I didn't eat them, not because I don't like them, but because I gave them my my doggo as a treat,  but apparently she loves MRE tortillas way more than MRE crackers because she basically licked them a few times and then walked away from them! Crazy.

Pic 5 needs no explanation.  Sweet, crunchy, and wonderful.

Now, Pics 6-7 show part of the secret to crispy hashbrowns, frying them. 

But, 1st, you have to pat as much liquid out of them as possible on paper towels before even attempting this. Then, you have to let them sit in the hot pan to crisp up! Stop moving them around so much! 

This glorious bowl of hashbrowns also includes the cheese spread, only added at the end of the cooking process. I also added black pepper and cayenne! Wow, this was a great breakfast and my whole house smells of wonderful onions, peppers, and just general yumminess!

This was a great menu and took a bit of effort to prepare (and now I have to scrub a pan 😞), but the payoff was entirely worth it!

Again, thanks to Mike for the experience! Hope you all enjoy some of these slightly older menus as I have a couple more 2019s I'll be reviewing soon, including the 2019 Maple Sausage Patty menu!

1q2w7w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbedroom/comments/1q2w7w1/dead_bedroom_only_13_months_of_marriage/,Dead bedroom only 13 months of marriage?,"Hi everyone. I’m trying to get perspective and keep emotions out of this as much as possible.

I’ve (27 HLF) been married to my husband (28 LLM) for 13 months, together for 16 months total. Early in dating, sex happened every time we saw each other. After marriage, it was about 3–4 times a week. Around a year in, it dropped to once a week. Over the last few months, it’s now once every 2–3 weeks, sometimes longer. I feel like we should still be in the honeymoon stage and we're fairly young.

He has issue of cheating (OF subscriptions, talking to girls in snap/IG/discord).

Last sex was on Christmas but it's more like a duty sex ""just to get over with"". The bigger issue than frequency is desire and initiation:

•      He does not initiate sex anymore.

•	When I initiate, I’m usually rejected.

•	When sex does happen, it feels obligatory/duty-based.

•	No French kissing since Sept 2025.

•	He avoids sexual escalation and pulls away if cuddling turns sexual.

He still shows affection in non-sexual ways:

Cuddling, hugging, pecks, saying ""I love you”, Buys me coffee/food, checks in, etc.

But there is no sexual pursuit, flirting, or spontaneous desire (no late-night or morning interest).

He refuses marriage therapy and says he’s “not in the mood” when I bring up sex or initiate. Recently, he also commented that I’ve gained weight, which added to the confusion given the sexual distance.

Sexual connection is a dealbreaker for me in a relationship. The ongoing rejection has taken a toll on my self-esteem and has led me to seek validation outside the marriage (I feel guilt about this and know it’s not a solution).

My questions:

Does this qualify as a dead bedroom given how early the marriage is?

•	How do you distinguish low libido vs emotional withdrawal?

•	Has anyone experienced this early on and seen real change without therapy?

•	At what point do you stop waiting and accept that this may be the baseline?

1q2w1ri,https://i.redd.it/6wyz03a055bg1.png,What kinds of trees does the City of Barrie plant along our streets? [OC],"The city of Barrie has a great open data portal, with a wealth of information. This map plots 33,663 trees in the [Trees layer](https://opendata.barrie.ca/datasets/barrie::tree/about) published in 2023. Of Barrie's tracked street trees, 55% are non-native species, with the invasive Norway Maple coming out at 29% of all trees. However, this is [an improving trend](https://i.imgur.com/ruHewi2.png) as the majority of newly planted small diameter trees are native species. Dominant species preference varies a lot by neighbourhood, and I think the map makes an interesting reference.

Note, I do not work for the city and did not incorporate other reports or data. As of the publishing of the Urban Forestry Strategy in 2013 the city's inventory was considered relatively complete. However, since that time there's been another decade of planting and the 10% of the trees that were Ash have all been killed by Emerald Ash Borer. There are a number of contradictions, omissions and errors in the source data. I made my best guess at species identity using what information was available in these cases, but for this reason this map is only representational of the source's contents and could not be accurate at the level of an individual tree.

Bird Friendly coffee is a specific, rigorous type of shade-grown coffee, certified by the Smithsonian, that ensures high standards for bird habitat and is always organic. Fair trade coffee ensures farmers receive fair prices, promotes sustainable farming, and guarantees safe working conditions by adhering to strict certification standards. And buying in bulk using your own containers reduces wasteful packaging. This is one of those rare everyday decisions that quietly improves lives across entire ecosystems, from tropical soils and forests to farming communities and downstream rivers. Coffee is grown in some of the world’s most biologically rich regions, which means how it’s produced matters enormously. When sourced thoughtfully, coffee can shift from being a driver of deforestation, pollution, and poverty to a tool for restoration, resilience, and dignity.

Here are the many benefits created by making the switch:

*1. Protects forest ecosystems and prevents deforestation

Shade-grown coffee is cultivated under a canopy of native trees rather than in sun-exposed monocultures, helping preserve forest structure and prevent land clearing. This maintains habitat continuity, reduces erosion, and keeps carbon stored in living biomass instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.

2. Supports birds, insects, and wildlife

Traditional shade coffee farms can support hundreds of bird species, including migratory birds that rely on these habitats during long journeys. Insects, mammals, and amphibians also benefit from layered vegetation, leaf litter, and intact food webs that disappear in sun-grown plantations.

3. Builds healthier soil and reduces erosion

Organic practices avoid synthetic fertilizers and pesticides that degrade soil biology. Combined with shade trees, they improve soil structure, increase organic matter, enhance water retention, and reduce erosion on steep slopes where coffee is often grown.

4. Protects water quality and downstream rivers

Organic coffee farming reduces chemical runoff into streams and rivers that supply drinking water and irrigation to nearby communities. Shade systems also slow rainfall, allowing water to infiltrate soil rather than carrying sediment and pollutants downstream.

5. Reduces harm to pollinators and beneficial insects

By eliminating toxic agrochemicals, organic shade-grown farms create safer conditions for pollinators and natural pest predators which strengthens ecological balance.

6. Improves farmer health and safety

Avoiding synthetic pesticides protects farm workers and their families from exposure linked to respiratory illness, neurological harm, and long-term health risks. This is a direct human health benefit often overlooked in discussions of sustainability.

7. Provides fairer and more stable income for farmers

Fair-trade standards establish minimum prices and premiums that help farmers weather market volatility, invest in their farms, and meet basic needs. This stability reduces pressure to clear more land or adopt environmentally damaging practices just to survive.

8. Strengthens local communities and worker rights

Fair-trade systems support cooperatives, democratic decision-making, safer working conditions, and community projects such as schools, healthcare access, and clean water infrastructure.

9. Preserves biodiversity hotspots

Many coffee-growing regions overlap with global biodiversity hotspots. Shade-grown, organic coffee helps protect these irreplaceable areas by keeping land in complex, living systems rather than simplified agricultural zones.

10. Reduces climate impact and increases resilience

Shade trees sequester carbon, buffer temperature extremes, and help farms adapt to climate stress such as drought and heat. Diverse systems are more resilient than monocultures as climate conditions become less predictable.

11. Cuts packaging waste when purchased in bulk

Buying beans in bulk using your own containers reduces single-use packaging and transportation emissions. Stored properly, whole beans stay fresh longer, reducing food waste as well.

\---------------------------------------------

THE GOSPEL OF THE OPEN ROAD IS WRITTEN IN OIL AND SCAR TISSUE

1. Thou shalt seek the wisdom of the professional instructor and the orange cone. Your buddy who has been riding for twenty years probably has terrible habits that will get you into trouble. Take a real class every few years to keep your skills sharp.
2. Thou shalt wrap thy flesh in the armor of the beast and the weave of the fiber. The pavement is a giant belt sander and it does not care about your fashion choices or how short the trip is. Buy the best gear your budget allows and wear every piece of it every single time you swing a leg over the seat.
3. Thou shalt honor the mechanical spirit of the machine before every journey. Check your tire pressure and look for leaks or loose bolts before you ever think about clicking into gear. Finding out your brakes are shot while you are flying toward a stop sign is a bad way to start the weekend.
4. Thou shalt bear the full weight of thy own survival with a sober heart. We accept a level of danger that car drivers will never understand so there is no excuse for adding more risk. Own every mile and realize that your safety is entirely your own problem to solve.
5. Thou shalt cast thy pride into the gutter before the engine starts to roar. Let the teenagers and the angry drivers have their little victories while you focus on staying upright. Showing off for strangers is a fast way to find yourself in the weeds with a broken bike and a bruised ego.
6. Thou shalt master the fire of thy temper and the surge of thy hormones. Riding while you are steaming mad or overly excited is a recipe for slow reflexes and terrible choices. If your head is not in the right place you should just stay in the garage and tinker until the storm passes.
7. Thou shalt look upon every driver as a wandering blind psycho out to hunt thee. Assume every blinker is a lie and every car at an intersection is waiting for the worst possible moment to pull out. When you expect people to be idiots you are never surprised by their total lack of awareness.
8. Thou shalt yield the road when the flesh grows heavy and the mind begins to wander. Pushing through exhaustion is just as dangerous as riding after a few beers. Stop for a coffee or a nap the moment you start zoning out or missing your turns on the highway.
9. Thou shalt dwell in the sanctuary of the open lane and the wide buffer zone. Keep a massive bubble of space around you so you always have a place to go when things go wrong. Never linger in a blind spot or get boxed in by large trucks that cannot see you.
10. Thou shalt lift thy gaze to the horizon and the path far ahead of thy wheel. Look through the corner to where you want to go instead of staring at the road right in front of you. Your bike follows your eyes so keep them scanning for sand and oil well before you reach it.
11. Thou shalt temper the fury of the engine in the presence of the law and the crossroad. Speed is a wonderful tool but it will also shrink your reaction time down to nothing when a car pulls out. Save the high speed runs for the track where there are no minivans and no side streets to worry about.
12. Thou shalt fear the oil of the earth and the weeping of the sky above. The road turns into a skating rink the moment the rain starts to lift the grime to the surface. Smooth out all your inputs and give yourself twice as much room to stop when the pavement is wet.
13. Thou shalt walk thy own path among the brethren of the road even in a crowd. Never feel forced to keep up with a faster rider if you are feeling out of your depth. A real group of friends will wait for you at the next turn and respect your pace.
14. Thou shalt rehearse the day of the sudden stop in the quiet and empty places. Spend some time in a parking lot practicing how to stop as fast as possible without locking your wheels. You want that muscle memory to take over the second a deer jumps out in front of you.
15. Thou shalt nourish the clay with water and the spirit with proper rest. Dehydration makes you slow and stupid which are the two worst things a rider can be on two wheels. Keep a bottle of water handy and eat a decent meal so your brain stays locked on the mission. ",0,1767450547.0,motorcycles,2,0.29,False

1q2vsqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1q2vsqd/is_this_sinful/,Is this sinful?,"Fair warning, this is mildly explicit, and definitely TMI

First, a bit about me. I was saved ~3 years ago. God has certainly been working in my life and is constantly renewing my mind and sanctifying me. Before I was saved, p*rn (and all that accompanies it) was a life-dominating sin. I think I was 11 the first time I saw it, and it became a regular part of my life since then, worsening very quickly in both frequency and depth of sin. Thankfully, it’s now been nearly 2 years since I’ve sought it out (praise the Lord!). Perhaps it would be helpful to know that I am also single and always have been.

I know that I will get a variety of answers to this question, but I am wondering if the following is sinful. A few times, I have woken up in the middle of the night half asleep (sometimes a bit more a wake than that) and positioned (and sometimes repositioned) myself in such a way that I would orgasm. However, during this, I did not have any lustful thoughts. I vividly remember one of these times I only had coffee on my mind (why? i don’t know).

I really am unsure as to whether or not this is sinful. Like I said, p*rn was a life-dominating sin, and I want nothing to do with it or anything close to it. However, certainly nocturnal emissions are not sinful, they only made the Israelite’s ceremonially unclean. I am not sure where on that spectrum this lies, as I was not thinking with lust. 

Of course, sexual ethics flow from the command not to commit adultery, but I suppose I am wondering what the essence is of adultery. Adultery is a perversion of marriage, which is primarily a symbol to Christ’s union with the Church. So if someone commits fornication, those people are in union with each other without a covenant (essential to Christ’s union with the Church—God relates to His people through covenants). Obviously adultery itself is breaking that marriage covenant. Bestiality can be lumped under fornication, but additionally it involves a creature not made in God’s image—Christ is sanctifying His church, conforming her to His image. Homosexuality denies a man-woman relationship, which genders typify Christ and His church (this is more important than it just being a creation ordinance). Then of course, lust is just committing these sins in the heart (sidebar, I recently heard that the Pharisees thought it was sinful to look at a woman period, and they also recognized that if someone willed to do good (though they were prevented or whatever) then God accredited to them as righteousness but they thought that if they thought of sin or willed evil then God wouldn’t consider it sin, so when Jesus told the Pharisees that if you look at a woman with lust you are guilty of adultery, He was correcting both issues—not inherently sinful to look at a woman, definitely sinful to think sinful things).

With all that being said, I don’t know if adultery is a perversion of marriage because of the relationship (i.e., lack of covenant and people involved) or if it is because all things sexual are reserved for the marriage bed. I’m not attempting to create a false dichotomy, there is certainly room for both to be answers. The biggest reason I’m hesitant to think that is it only because of the relationships between parties is because nocturnal emission is not sinful, even though it is certainly a byproduct of the fall, and it would only make someone ceremonially unclean. I’m sure someone might also bring up Onan in Gen. 38, but I think his sin is in not fulfilling his duty as a brother to take over for his dead brother and he was of the seed of Judah, so there is a bloodline thing going on similar to Gen 4-5 with the Cainites and Sethites (Cainites = city of man, Sethites = city of God, seed that replaced Abel, Cainites were killing the line of Seth, near fulfilment of Gen 3:15) or (more clearly) Abram marrying his half sister and having Isaac take a wife from his family and not the Canaanites (who were cursed in Gen 9). The Scriptural witness is overwhelmingly more concerned about the covenant aspect of marriage and defiling it in that way.

I want to clarify also, I by no means desire to justify myself. Clearly, I’ve put some thought into this, and the only reason I have is because I do not feel particularly guilty afterwards, which is incredible as I am very prone to legalism and am constantly feeling guilty for different things, some of which aren’t even actually sinful (like I said, legalism)—I have a rather “tender conscience” as some would put it. I would think that the lack of guilt may be just from the pleasure from this thing, but it doesn’t really surface later on either. 

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Maybe it’s time for Rush and Nader to contact with bio mum and let her see the grandchildren especially Rushes girls who are so disliked by Samah , I think miram deserves to feel love of a real mother inlaw and her kids .

As we move through the holidays and it gets colder and the wind gets harsher I am sending out a request for help. We are trying to stay open overnight every night!!

Below you will find a couple links for the warming center. Each one for something different. Please read them carefully.   We have been averaging roughly 20 guests per evening for dinner and 10-12 overnight each time we open.  

1st: [https://m.signupgenius.com/...](https://m.signupgenius.com/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExNG51dEZQdUxyQThaWTk4OHNydGMGYXBwX2lkEDIyMjAzOTE3ODgyMDA4OTIAAR723boUKej_5YWLJzQJquuu4_31dIUTVTJlK7AiJ-3bWjm3sKJYXYHLFPQPww_aem_-9BpbCa_pFWgfZgPhbxvkA#!/showSignUp/70A0A4DABA62FA6FF2-60144171-warming)

This is the link to sign up to help during the 5pm - 10 pm dinner shift.    You could be making coffee, helping with dinner, light cleaning and organize supplies, chatting with guests, playing games, etc. As the new year approaches we have plenty of evenings with nobody scheduled.

This is for those volunteers who can stay overnight during lights out and quiet time for guests.  We require 2 per shift for safety and security reasons.  These shifts are more relaxed. Bring a book, or a laptop and some headphones. Catch up on emails or Facebook. Watch a movie.  Lots of downtime while guests sleep.

This is the meal train website for those who want to come and provide a meal for our guests. If you are coming and staying with us to prep, cook, and serve please also sign up on the 1st signup so we know how many helpers you might need. We typically eat at 7pm.  You don’t have to stay the whole evening but we ask you stay thru dinner and cleanup. Typically that runs thru about 8:30pm. 

Meal requirements can be found in this link as well. 

Our community talks about how much we need to help those less fortunate all the time. Please consider singing up and coming to help us out.

I know the 'how to make friends' posts get annoying, but this isn't exactly that--

I \*have\* friends, but they all have kids, work long hours, and live in BFE.

I need women in the Pelham, Helena, Hoover, or SW vestavia area who can hang out, go for walks, thrifting, coffee or crafting. I'm big on last minute ""hey can you meet for coffee in an hour?"" vibes. I work irregular hours, so occasional availability during the standard workweek time is a plus but not required.

I will bake you cookies and/or we can meet in a public place so you can make sure I'm not an axe murderer.

DM me if interested. I don't see reddit chats unless I put my mobile browser into desktop mode, which I forget to do regularly, so I will probably forget and not see your message for like 3 weeks.",28,1767449962.0,Birmingham,19,0.86,False
