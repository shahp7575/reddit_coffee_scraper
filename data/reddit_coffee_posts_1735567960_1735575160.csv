NEGLECTED FROGS+OTHER HERPETOLOGICAL BABIES+MORE!,"Trying to keep this as short and sweet as possible. By no means am I any sort of enthusiast or expert. Just an animal lover that ironically used to get the heebie jeebies from anything without fur. To make a long story short I moved to a new city alone. I frequented coffee shops and bookstores. I was so very excited to see a ‘small business’ as a pet store as I am an avid animal lover.  I made my way in. It smelled like damp, moldy wood shavings, stagnant water, and an overall ‘fishy’ smell. It’s oddly cold inside despite their clear main attraction being reptiles and tropical fish. The tanks are smaller than the OG Walmart tanks with goldfish in em except this time it’s massive massive lizards and snakes. Empty water containers, seems like they’re reaching for the heat lamp yet are extremely unhappy and unwell because it’s just not enough. They have 25 MIN. Rats to a cage. 30+ small birds to a room no bigger than a budget motel bathroom. I was wanting to buy 2 WTF as I have done my research and truly believe I could give them a healthy happy habitat. Is it unethical to buy from a place such as this? I’m looking at it as an ‘I saved you from this shithole’ pov as well as a ‘don’t support this business’ pov. I do not know how to go about reporting this type of thing besides leaving google reviews. My county offers ZERO animal control laws and I don’t know what to do. Who do I contact. Should I adopt the two WTF I was planning on or will it encourage sales?? Is it worth it to save at least two since they face no reprimand? Please help. ",1,1735575008.0,frogs,0,1.0,False

About 2 or 3 times if I recall correctly.

I did this because my mother and grandma have not the best relationship and my mom has told me very much about how abusive my grandma has been in her childhood. It all still haunts my mother.

These were things like:

- waking her up in the middle of the night, forcing her to go to the toilet because she often wet the bed and when it then happened still, she apparently was beaten or scolded for it. Accused she was doing it on purpose.

- Beating her for her ADHD, which was not well known back then. Always being told „you just don‘t want to“ and not believing her that she just couldn’t. In regards to ADHD, there is a lot more.

- Not believing her that she was sexually assaulted by a friend of my grandma. She kept in touch with him and my mom had to see him more often in her home. When she was 18, she reported him to the authorities and my grandma accused her of „destroying a beautiful family“ (the guy was a father and had a wife).

- Treating her different than her Brothers because she was a girl and not a boy. Her Dad also ignored her and only cared for his boy.

Keep in mind, these are all one sided stories by my mom, though I can‘t think of why she would lie to me about that.

In the talks that I recorded my grandmother, we talked about this stuff. My mom and her were kinda fighting a bit in this time and I confronted her about this.

She mostly got really defensive and emotional. I understand how having a kid with ADHD can be stressful and frustrating. I have it myself. She justified her behavior with that she didn‘t know any better. Doctors were telling her „she wets the bet on purpose. Try waking her up in the night and sitting her on the toilet“. And when she then still wet the bed she was frustrated and accused her of doing it on purpose and why she hated her. She also says all this stuff is „cold coffee“ and my mom should let it rest.

I think my grandma is generally good hearted. But this stuff is just traumatizing. She also doesn’t want to apologize, because it‘s 40+ years old.

I recorded this because I wanted to discuss these things with my mom later to see her perspective on the things she said. Also I was angry at my grandma at the time and thought I would do something good because I was helping my mom. I was really on my mothers side of this and she basically involved me with her issues since I was 14, I think. She had no one else who truly understood her. She always says that I am the first person to truly understand her. I kinda feel like I was a bit manipulated by her because of this. This also leaded to me not liking my dad because they have issues. Today I try to not be inbetween this stuff anymore.

Anyway, this is why I recorded my grandma. I‘ve sent these files to my mom (I recorded it as a voice message in our chat) and my mom accidentally sent them to my grandma who then confronted me a few days later about it. She was disappointed and told me how this was illegal. I understand her truly. I broke her trust and I would NEVER do this ever again. I‘ve hurt her while thinking I was doing something good. I‘ve learned my lesson.

I apologized to her and she forgave me. I kinda can‘t seem to forgive myself for it though.

It was one hot Saturday at the coffee shop. 

You were there, sitting alone, wiping your face with a handkerchief for that one hot Saturday, but your face was brighter than sunshine. It's almost a year from that day, and we are not talking anymore nowadays. Good as dead, but I will never forget the first words. 

""Is this seat taken?"" you asked.

Funny thing was, I nodded at the same time, saying ""no."". Was I stupid? No, you were more stupid for wearing that pair of Wayfarer sunglasses indoors, so don't blame me for paying more attention to them.

You were seated next to me, and I could remember what I was studying at that time, hematology pediatrics. I always claim I have this photographic memory. The only common thing we had that day was wearing black tops and shorts.

I glanced at your things. Rules of Court, huh? Very neat. I guess you were pissed for noticing I looked at you several times. Wearing sunglasses indoors was a neat trick. But my only regret is that I was too sleepy that day. I guess you saw me sleeping with my mouth open.

Several nights passed, and I noticed you always came alone wearing a serious smirk on your face, usually in the late evenings. You almost convinced me you were a vampire who lures at night. The only companions you had were cigarettes kissing you every 30 minutes. What convinced me even more was that you wore black so often that I can't barely distinguish you from a barrista, not a barrister. 

One rainy evening, I left the cafe and almost had another thought on which way home to take, but you were apparently walking behind me, probably half a foot away from me. It was so awkward; I should have taken slower steps, but it was raining. If only I had the guts to say, ""Hi, I'm Isabel; I always see you at the coffee shop."" No, I didn't have. 

Next thing we knew, we were talking already. Forgive me for thinking your name is Ron for days and being poor at hearing. One of the first questions I asked you was what your age was. I blurted it out over Pesto pasta, and forgive me again for being poor at speaking. Deep inside, I was laughing for being such a moron.

Somehow, memories of the night when my exam results were released still linger as the pencils you gave me still sit on the table. You held my hand walking home on a lovely night in Makati. You kissed me on the neck. My biggest regret that night is that I should have kissed you back. 

I miss the days. The routine eats at McDonald's between study breaks, like I always said, were always ""buwis buhay."" Rather than pissed, I found it amusing that your fascination is probably infatuation with McDonald's, the food you can eat all year round. I'm glad I told you what the numbers were for in the ketchup sachets. Maybe that is enough—my memory of me in the ketchups.

I will never forget the odd things about you—the night you showed up with a Mickey Mouse t-shirt and that plastic envelope with a handle that you carried around, which I teased as your attache case. And you never used that again after. Oh, the time you chased your umbrella? It was both funny and sweet. I miss the cigarettes breaks and the highest form of virginity, which you said was virgin impacta. Or did you really say virgin compacta? I'm really poor at hearing. Whenever you were around, I had this sense of security; I could say anything that I missed the most. From nonsensical weird bus incidents to the matters of my illness and past relationships.

You were the person who once became the center of my universe, which you even did not realize. The one who stole my heart like a thief in the night. The one with whom I talked like stars at night before I slept. But when you vanished, like a star's death, you as well created an inner void in me like my very own black hole, an unexplainable area where unspeakable grief lies. 

You asked me twice what I write in blogs. I don't even consider myself a writer. A storyteller perhaps. What a good thing about me is I don't lie. You probably lied a thing or two, but surprisingly, I am not even mad at this moment. In fact, I am even happy that you made it also. I strongly believe it was the pencils I gave you. God knows how much I prayed and loved you nonetheless. 

Apparently, I still see those memories flashing on my mind every second like fireflies at night. Lovely, sometimes euphoric, but can't be grasped and relived. 

❤️

See you in another life Atty, when we are both cats.

1hpq6hc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1hpq6hc/have_yourself_a_black_sabbath_christmas/,Have Yourself a BLACK SABBATH Christmas,"Hi. My name is Randall Huckabee, I’m a retired librarian. Mr. Excitement, that’s me. As a hobby, I’ve taken to assembling music box figurines. It’s easy, you can order them from Amazon. Since they come mostly assembled, I decided to spruce things up by replacing the music. Not an easy feat, let me tell you. They come equipped with tiny keyboards that only play certain notes. Good thing I play a mean piano.

 

I like jazz music. Not the over-the-top, can’t-tap-your-toes-to-it jazz, but Cool Jazz. Think: Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck – and if I’m feeling extra spicy – Thelonius Monk. My goal was to personalize some figurines and give them to my family. Sounds nice, right? It was a good idea. It truly was. But something went dreadfully wrong.

 

I made six in total. One for each of my three sisters (all younger), two for my kids (all grown up now), and one for my wife. She’s deceased, but don’t get choked up about that. Life, as they say, must go on. Still, I like to think she’s here with me in this rickety old house. Same house we raised our children many moons ago.

 

For the kids (and their spouses), I chose Jack and what’s-her-name from the movie Titanic. You know, the scene where they’re at the bow of the ship, arms locked, gazing at the wondrous world of the ocean. And for music, I added ‘I Will Survive’. Looking back, maybe this wasn’t such a good idea, considering the Titanic sank. But hindsight is what it is, and the irony was lost on me.

 

For my sisters: tiny ballerinas. As children, they’d parade in their pink tutus, dancing along to the Nutcracker. So, for the music, I chose Carol of the Bells.  Finding a music box with that many notes was not easy. Plus, it’s a difficult tune to play, especially for an arthritic old fart like me. But I persevered. That’s what I do.

 

For my darling wife, I wanted something special, seeing how this year would’ve been our 50th wedding anniversary, so I made her an angel who plays Louis Armstrong’s What a Wonderful World. You see, this may be my last Christmas in this rickety old house. Doctors say my time is limited. But isn’t that true for all of us? Anyway, I’m sidetracking. “Get to the point, Randy!” my wife would say. “You’re procrastinating again!”

 

Last week, my family showed up for an early Christmas dinner.  The dinner was nice. My sister Maybelle (the oldest of the bunch) cooked a turkey as plump as Saint Nick's rear end, with all the fixings. My youngest son Luke and his wife brought oven-baked apple pie. 

 

Then there’s Eitan, my one-and-only grandchild. A real hell-raiser, he is. During dinner, the kid was mucking around with candles and nearly burned the house down, Looking back, maybe that would’ve done us all a favor.

 

After the Christmas feast, we exchanged gifts. The sisters got me sweaters. Not the cheap ones either. The thick, woolly ones that endure the cruelest winter hardship. The kids chipped in and bought me a TV as big as a movie screen. They even signed me up to all the latest streaming sites. If only I could get the stupid remotes to cooperate, maybe I’d catch a show or two. But I digress.

 

The trouble started in the wee hours of night. By then, most of the family was gone. The sisters left shortly after the gifts were exchanged (surprise, surprise), and Paul, my oldest, left later that evening; Luke, his wife Charla, and Eitan stayed the night. Eitan kept tinkering with my wife’s figurine, getting his filthy hands all over it. I damn-near spanked the little brat. Would have, if that were allowed these days.

 

The boy slept on the couch, Paul and Charla slept in the spare bedroom. Paul’s old room, in fact. Ralf, my dear ol’ Great Dane, slept with me on the bed, as he always does. Then the unthinkable happened. You see, sometime during the night, all through the house, a creature was stirring. It wasn’t Ralf. And it certainly wasn't quiet as a mouse. 

 

BOOM BOOM BOOM. 

 

I shot out of bed like a firecracker. Where’s the banging coming from? And why so friggin’ loud? Figuring the neighbors were having a party, I buried my head under the pillows, and tried to shut it out.

 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR.

 

I nearly fell off the bed. 



""What's that noise?"" I grumbled. 



It sounded like a chainsaw, only louder and more distorted. I didn’t like it. Neither did Ralf. He started barking, which he rarely does. By now, the entire household was awake. We assembled in the living room, rubbing the sleep from our weary eyes. Paul was hungover, I could tell. Too much eggnog.

 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR.

 

I thought it was the TV, so I grabbed the remote and accidentally turned it full blast. Paul was shouting, but I couldn’t hear him. I’m partially deaf. If the noise was this loud to me, I can only imagine how loud it was for them.

 

Eitan, wearing Spider Man pajamas two sizes too small, was bawling, snot sliding down his fatty face. The kid looked like maple syrup was poured over him, and he was trying to lick it off. His mother was going bananas. She stole the remote, turned off the TV, then threw the remote against the wall. Good thing it didn’t break. Then came the voice, sardonic and overtly cynical. A demon’s voice. The weight of the noise nearly knocked me over. I’d never heard anything so loud. So rude.

 

I AM IRON MAN.

 

And still, nobody knew where it was coming from. My brain was rattling inside my head. I was shaking. Simultaneously sweating and cold. Hell, I thought I was suffering a stroke. A heart attack, perhaps. Then I recognized the sound. It was that devil-worshiping group from England: Black Sabbath.

 

I hate Black Sabbath. Amateur musicians, at best. But my wife, she loved them. Saw them in concert many times. (We’d had several heated quarrels about this, but ultimately, I lost every one of them.)

 

What the heck was happening here? Why was Black Sabbath performing in my house? And must they play so loudly? Paul, steam puffing from his cauliflower ears, was scanning the living room. He even checked outside. Just in case. No one knew where the God-awful noise was coming from. Ralf went sniffing, searching for clues. When he approached my wife’s music box, he started barking at it.

 

“The music box!” shouted Paul, loud enough for the neighbors to hear.

 

“What?”

 

“The music box!”

 

“Speak up!”

 

This was getting ridiculous. Eitan was sucking his thumb like a baby; he had urine dripping down his leg. Charla was shouting at the top of her lungs, but all we heard was that blasted heavy metal music. I started crying. I hate to admit this, but I was overstimulated. And tired. It was 3 am, for Christ’s sake. I should be sleeping. Hell, we all should be. Nothing clever happens at 3 am.

 

Eitan grabbed the harp-tooting angel and stuck it inside his mouth. 

 

His mother was furious. “Gimme that, Eaty. Or else!”

 

The boy refused to give it up, Instead, he leapt off the couch like a guitar villain, and started rocking out, snot charging down his chin. All the while, the blue angel kept blaring Black Sabbath.

 

HAS HE LOST HIS MIND?

 

“Drop the box, Eaty!” his mother kept shouting.

 

The boy farted, and some of it leaked out. (A shart, I’d later learn.) I could’ve killed him. Amidst the mayhem, Eitan threw the figurine against the bookshelf, knocking over the entire top row. The defiled angel teetered vicariously over the edge. One more outburst and it's done for. Everyone held their breathe. 

 

IS HE ALIVE OR DEAD?

 

The angel tumbled, crashing onto the hardwood floor. 

 

NOW HE HAS HIS REVENGE

 

Down came the entire bookshelf. 



Everyone gasped. The angel was dead, crushed by a Holy Bible. 



Ralf, the cowardly ol’ pooch, disappeared into my bedroom, whimpering, while we stood transfixed, reveling in the resounding silence. It was an awful sight. A fleet of hardcovers, mostly Harry Bosch, carpeted the floor. The lamp next to the bookshelf was broken, the bulb shattered. None of that mattered. What mattered was the bible, which belonged to my wife’s grandfather, who brought it over from Sicily. 

 

On the cover was a large golden cross and fancy-looking words written in Latin. Something about Christ being King. The leatherbound bible was from the Gothic era, so it was big and black and creepy as hell. It weighed as much as Eitan, I’d wager. All eyes were on me. Nobody knew what to do. Heck, I didn’t know what to do either, so I joined ol’ quivering Ralf on my bed, leaving them to deal with the mess. 

 

Next came a series of nightmares. In them, I was assaulted by never-ending heavy metal music. Namely, Black Sabbath. Every damned song in their catalogue, as far as I could tell. Although they all sound the same. I couldn’t wake up soon enough.

 

They must’ve cleaned up the mess, because when I awoke, the books were back on the shelf, the Holy Bible was dead center, where it belongs. A new bulb lit the lamp. Everything was where it should be. Except for one thing.

 

“Where’s the music box?”

 

Charla, looking twelve years older than she did the previous day, shot Paul a look. Paul gulped. They were seated at the kitchen table, fully-dressed, sipping freshly-brewed coffee, and wearing worried-sick faces. I poured myself a mug, praying last night was an elaborate hoax. Maybe they’d drugged me. Wouldn’t put it past them.

 

“Um, Pop,” Paul stuttered. “The music boxes were a nice gesture…” Charla’s eyes never leaving his, “but...” Tomato-faced, he returned the gift.

 

I was stunned. “If you don’t want the damned thing, just say so!” 

 

Paul nodded. Charla squeezed his arm, then adjusted her glasses, which were too big for her thinly freckled face.

 

“But…” pouted Eiten. “I want it!”

 

He was wearing an Iron Man tee, which was covered in chocolate. Or at least, I hoped it was chocolate. Glued to his filthy little fingers was my wife’s music box. He pressed play. Then he farted. Overwhelmed by the abominable odor, the blue angel sang. What a wonderful world indeed. 

 

Charla’s face matched Paul’s. After the most awkward breakfast in the history of the world, they decided to keep their gift, which was still in its box. Eitan wanted to reassemble it. The kid may be a jackass, but at least he's curious.

 

After they left, I spent the day trying to figure out the new TV. Yeah, call me a stereotype-old-gaffer (which I am), but I couldn’t get the stupid thing to cooperate. Finally, several YouTube tutorials later, I got the stupid thing to work, and I watched a movie: Titanic. Hadn't seen it in years. Once the boat sank, I was set to retire for the night. My phone buzzed. My sisters were calling. It was a group chat, which they’d never done. I didn’t like it. Figured someone must’ve died.

 

“Hello?”

 

After an uncomfortable silence, Maybelle spoke up.

 

“Um, Randy,” she coughed. “How are things?”

 

“Get to the point, May. I’m in bed.”

 

More coughing. I could hear a woman’s voice in the background. The voice didn’t sound pleasant.

 

“That music box…”

 

More muffled chatter.

 

Melanie, the oldest, interrupted. “It’s possessed!”

 

Silence.

 

“There,” her voice lowered, “I said it.”

 

I laughed. It was a nervous laugh, and once I started, I couldn’t stop. Even Ralph joined up, barking up a storm.

 

“Randy,” now Maybelle, “We’re serious.”

 

“Unless,” back to Mel, “you triggered them to play Black FUCKING Sabbath, full volume.”

 

“Even when they’re shut off…”

 

“In the middle of the night!”

 

A chill dripped down my spine. I dropped the phone. What in blue-blazes were they gabbing about? Possessed? Black Sabbath? Then I remembered. It’s funny how the mind works. It tricks you. You see, by dinner, I’d forgotten the chaos from the previous night. 

 

“Hello?” Maybelle speaking, “Anybody home?”

 

“You two are off your rockers!”

 

I hung up. They could destroy the damned things for all I cared. I put my heart and soul into assembling those music boxes. Now this? I put my phone on silent and went to bed. Good riddance.

 

…

 

BOOM BOOM BOOM.

 

I snapped awake.

 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR.

 

“What the?”

 

Ralf was trembling, his puppy-dog eyes all droopy. He stood up, shaking, and half-hid under the bed.  

 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR.

 

The Noise. Loud and rude and mean and raucous. This can’t be happening. I’m dreaming. Must be.

 

I AM IRON MAN.

 

My blood turned icy cold, the hairs standing tall on my arms. My testicles disappeared. As the raging guitars soared, seventy-seven years of pent-up rage came coursing through my veins. I leapt out of bed, tripped over Ralf, and fell face-first.

 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR.

 

The music was FULL VOLUME. Everywhere at once. I hated it. I stood up (slowly this time), and pinched myself. This is real, I reminded myself. As crazy as it may be. 

 

HAS HE THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS HEAD?

 

I checked the time: 3:33 am. Somehow, this made it worse. Like a war-weathered tank, I barged into the living room, fists clenched, ready for battle.

 

“Where’s the wretched box?”

 

My voice was drowned out by the Noise. Something caught my attention. My wife, in the prime of her youth, regarding me via a framed high school picture. In it, she’s wearing a Black Sabbath tee, smiling mischievously. Taunting me.

 

I turned and stubbed my toe. Damn, it hurt. Cursing my existence, I stole another glance at my wife. She’s probably having herself a good laugh. Heck, she loved this song. I, on the other hand, was livid. I’m surprised the police aren’t banging on the door, the Noise was THAT loud.

 

NOBODY WANTS HIM.

 

Where IS the damned music box? Frantic, I scanned the living room. AHA! The bottom shelf. How in blue blazes did it get down there? And who repaired it? I knelt down and inspected it. The cracks it suffered were gone. Heck, it looked brand new. Still, something about the angel seemed wrong. Mostly, her eyes, callous and cold and impossibly red. Heavenly pink heart-shaped wings cradled her Tiffany-blue body, tin whistle tucked between ashen lips. But those eyes...

 

PLANNING HIS VENGEANCE.

 

My heart, rickety as a wooden roller coaster, nearly exploded. I raced to the garage, sweating and shivering at the same time; and after a panicky search, I found my hammer.

 

VENGEANCE FROM HIS GRAVE.

 

The blue angel tooted its whistle, fiery red eyes never leaving mine.

 

KILL THE PEOPLE HE ONCE SAVED.

 

I swung the hammer.

 

The angel exploded.

 

And the music stopped.

 

So did my heart.

 

…

 

As the week passed, my health steadily improved. But not a day went by when I didn’t think about the damned music box; the cursed blue angel, who died not once, but twice. I thought about that dreadful band from Britain. And, of course, I thought about my wife. 

 

…

 

This morning, a package arrived. I wasn’t expecting anything. But then again, tis the season, right? The box was decently heavy and marked FRAGILE. When I opened the package, I gasped.

 

The ballerinas.

 

Not one, but all three. My good-for-nothing sisters sent them back to me! Not surprisingly, I suppose, since I’d been ignoring their texts and emails. Not just from them, but from Luke and his wife. Like I needed more stress. Disgruntled, I found a place for the ballerinas on the bookshelf. I wound up the little ballerinas, just in case, checking to see if they were jinxed. Carol of the Bells percolated from tiny dancers as they twirled. Phew! Relief came instantaneously.

 

After dinner, I retreated to the living room for some quality TV time before bed. I must’ve fallen asleep on the sofa, because around 3 am, I snapped awake. My heart raced. Then it stopped. Then it started up again, twice as fast. I groaned. This can’t be happening. Please God. Not again.

 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR.

Hello r/AndroidGaming !

I've posted here previously about the game I've been developing, WalkScape. In short, it's an MMORPG inspired by RuneScape where you gain progress by walking in real life. Steps are counted even if the app is not open, so every step you take while your phone is in your pocket is counted for.

The game is currently in Closed Beta, and we have an open wave right now until 7th of January. You can start playing the game instantly if you support the development through our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/WalkScape) or [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/walkscape). You can also check [https://walkscape.app/help](https://walkscape.app/help) for more instructions on how to join, including joining the queue for the Closed Beta if you don't want to or can't support the development!

I'm an indie dev and we have three other people working on the game, and I want to emphasize that this game will **not be P2W** or have any predatory monetisation practises. The idea came to me as I'm a computer scientist student who is sitting a lot and I also have ADHD and needed a game to motivate myself to be more active. So combining RuneScape style game to walking felt like a great combination to get myself up and walking.

For more information about the game, I recommend to check out [the introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjaQeb5Rapg) to the game or check out r/WalkScape and our website.

So now he's getting it.,"My (30f) husband (31m) has become more of a recluse lately. To the point where me even asking to spend time with him has been met with eye rolls and heavy sighs. 

Fed up with feeling neglected, I confronted him the other night and told him that I'm not some toy that he can pick up and spend time with whenever he feels like, and that it isn't fair to me. He couldn't understand that somehow when he spends weeks pushing people away, like his family or me, that we aren't all going to be super happy and ready with open arms to suddenly hang out when he wants to. Something finally clicked and he came to me crying, hugging me, and apologizing. Or so I thought. 

Fast forward to last night, and I came up to him again asking to spend time. Maybe just as simple as a 30 minute card game or watching a movie. He huffed and puffed and said I kept interrupting him and he just wants to game. He said ""I never get any alone time! You're always home, and it's never just me!"" Which is partially true I will admit. I am at home a lot since college break and me working casually. But, I reminded him that he spent the entire day playing video games, and he will still be playing video games all by himself, uninterrupted, for the next 5 hours after I go to bed. I asked him how after 13 hours of gaming, that he doesn't have any time to do the things he wants. He fell silent.

So I told him today I'm giving him the whole day to himself. He's going to wake up by himself, go grocery shopping by himself, cooking by himself, house chores by himself, and ALL the gaming he wants. Completely uninterrupted. Because where will I be? I'll be going to the gym, getting a coffee, window shopping, and getting dinner without him. He says, ""but I want you to be with me while I do stuff."" Sorry pal! You don't get your cake and eat it too! 

I'm giving him his complete alone time. He'll be getting exactly what he asked for, and I'll be treating myself to a day of self-respect!",64,1735573800.0,TwoXChromosomes,11,0.9,False

It’s a trait that’s gotten me into trouble before, but this time, it led me to the Deep Web. You know, the hidden part of the internet you hear about in urban legends and conspiracy forums. It wasn’t enough to read about it; I had to see it for myself.

Equipped with a VPN, Tor browser, and a determination to prove the myths were nothing but overblown stories, I dove in. The first few hours were underwhelming. Old forums, cryptic message boards, marketplaces for stolen data—all illegal, sure, but not the nightmare fuel I had imagined.

Then I found the link.

A plain black screen with a single question in bold red letters:

“ARE YOU READY TO WATCH?”

Below it was a countdown timer, ticking down from five minutes. I hesitated. My heart pounded, but I clicked.

I thought about ignoring it, deleting the email and pretending none of this had happened. But the timer burned in my mind. The stories I’d read about Red Rooms—live-streamed torture shows where viewers paid in Bitcoin to dictate how the victims suffered—always felt like myths. This could be my chance to prove they weren’t real.

At the appointed time, I clicked the link. The screen went black for a moment, then flickered to life. A live feed appeared: a grim, windowless room lit by a single, swinging lightbulb. In the center was an old wooden chair bolted to the floor. Chains hung from the ceiling, casting ominous shadows on the cracked concrete walls.

Beside the video feed was a chatbox. Messages streamed in from users with handles like BloodReaper, PainDealer99, and Watcher000.

“Finally!”
“Bring her out!”
“$500 for pliers!”

I stared at the screen, horrified yet unable to look away. Moments later, a masked man stepped into the frame. He was tall, dressed in black from head to toe, his face hidden beneath a featureless, reflective mask. He dragged a struggling woman into view, her wrists and ankles bound with duct tape. She screamed against the gag in her mouth, her eyes wide with terror.

The chat exploded:

“YES!”
“I’ll pay $1,000 for fire!”
“Start slow!”

My stomach churned. This wasn’t a sick prank. This was real. I reached for my laptop’s power button, but before I could press it, the screen flashed red, and a message appeared:

“DO NOT LOOK AWAY.”

My heart skipped a beat. The masked man stopped mid-motion, tilting his head as if he could hear me. Then my webcam light flickered on.

“No,” I whispered. I grabbed a piece of tape to cover the camera, but another message flashed on the screen:

“WE SEE YOU.”

The man on the screen turned toward me. He raised a finger to the camera, wagging it like a teacher scolding a child. My hands trembled as I ripped the webcam from my laptop. The feed continued. The woman’s muffled screams grew louder as the masked man pulled a knife from his pocket.

The chatbox erupted in bids:

“$1,500 for the knife!”
“Make it slow!”
“This is amazing!”

I couldn’t take it anymore. I slammed the laptop shut, my heart racing. I told myself it was over, that it wasn’t real.


---

But the next day, my phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number:

“Why did you look away?”

My blood ran cold. Another text followed—a photo of me, sitting at my desk, the terror on my face frozen in time.

I deleted the texts, but more kept coming. Every night at exactly 11:00 p.m., I received an email with a new live stream link. Each one showed an empty room, waiting. The masked man always stood silently in the background, staring at the camera as if daring me to join.

Then, last night, everything changed. The live feed opened to a new location—a room I recognized instantly. It was my living room. The camera panned slowly, revealing my couch, my coffee table, my front door. A chill ran down my spine as I realized the stream wasn’t just showing my house.

It was live.

The chatbox exploded:
“YES! He’s next!”
“Do it!”
“$5,000 to make it quick!”

A knock sounded at my door.

I haven’t opened it yet. I don’t think I ever will. But I know they’re out there. Watching. Waiting.

And sooner or later, the stream will begin.

Wondering if anyone has any suggestions. ,"TLDR: I'll be seriously grateful for any suggestions on how to get my head right again. Get the same drive back that made me feel unstoppable before. 

Maybe 8yrs ago I met a very successful real estate professional who I convinced to take me under his wing. After a couple conversations, a personality test thing and the requirement to first read How to Win Friends and Influence People (lol) I began to work for him. He turned me on to Jim Rohn and to personal/professional development. I began to see success as a duty to myself and my family but it was exciting, not daunting. Within about 1.5yr selling real estate I was doing better than most agents who had done it for decades in terms of my understanding of the business, networking, volume etc. Being new in the business I found it necessary to work much more than others in my first few years while getting things built up. 80hr weeks were the norm. Getting home at 10pm-midnight wasn't uncommon but I still had the drive to wake up at 4:30am, read, have a coffee, hit the gym. To make the rest of the story brief, the hours plus other things, mostly the other things, resulted in a divorce for me. In attempt to save the relationship, I got a new job, sold my database, referred all my business back out, turned down a ton of money in new business to work a desk job with more normal hours. 

After the new job, many different types of jobs later I now find myself in a position to do really big things but I just cannot find the drive to get shit done. It really sucks because I remember what it felt like waking up and being excited to kick today's ass and make stuff happen. I have bills, a significant other I'm in love with, two kids.. aka all the reason in the world to get stuff done, but I feel like I've got zero drive and I can't shake it. 

In a way I sort of feel like a car in limp mode.. when the computer realizes something ain't right so it cuts all power except what is absolutely required to get you to a safe stopping point. 

Has anyone else ever experienced this type of thing and then gotten themselves back into a mental space where you feel ""powerful"" again? I just feel lazy and unmotivated all the time and identifying that about myself makes me feel like shit because I know I have been capable of doing more/better.

My micro-routines keep me going, but my space is chaotic, and tasks pile up until I tackle them in overwhelming bursts. I want a calm, organized life but feel emotionally drained by the effort required to maintain it. It’s exhausting, and I don’t know how to make it sustainable even though I'm on stimulant meds 3 days per week. 

&nbsp;

*Full Text:* I'm 32/F and have lived my entire life with a sort of simmering, low-grade level of discontent with the rhythm (or lack thereof) of my day-to-day life. The closest thing I have to a ""routine"" is that I usually get into the office half an hour before everyone else so I can walk to Starbucks. Don't get me wrong, I have my micro routines (phone, keys, wallet, inhaler) and I have so few things that it's hard to notice sometimes that everything is mostly scattered in doom piles, but it's still exhausting to perpetually look up at 7, 8, 9pm and regret that the dishes aren't done, the mail isn't sorted, and zero skincare has been applied. 

&nbsp;

Most of the time I don't mentally notice what I'm physically doing. I don't notice that I'm throwing three kinds of sauce bottles on the kitchen counter or that my suitcase is open in the exact middle of the living room. The only cleaning/decluttering/organizing I do is in 4-8 hour bursts, all at once, and then I'm too burnt out to ""maintain"" any of it until the next ""Oh shit, a guest/the repair professional/a delivery driver is coming over"" event. It's like my brain is giving me the finger 24/7, or more like I'm a Sim who hovers from potential chore to potential chore with all of them in the red. 

&nbsp;

I'm not sure what to do to feel content or to feel like my stuff isn't screaming at me that it needs to be washed, mended, sorted, or thrown away. I think that being sporadic has left me exhausted. I'd really like to be someone who could wake up and sit down in the living room to enjoy a cup of coffee and looks out the window, but the living room couch has Amazon boxes all over it and the window is dirty. Or someone who showers and does skincare in a nice robe, but showering takes it out of me so I just retreat to my bed and doze off with a towel around my hair. In the moment (and when I think to notice) it feels like the emotional toll of *making myself do something* is greater than the effort it takes to do it. It doesn't feel like burnout because I've been this way my whole life, but I wouldn't say that I'm happy with the state of things. I'm not sure if this resonates with anyone but I'd be curious to hear any perspectives or advice for dealing with this.",1,1735573100.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1hpprif,https://www.reddit.com/r/KiaEV9/comments/1hpprif/road_trip_for_the_light_range_model/,Road trip for the light range model. ,"
I recently took my EV9 on its first longish road trip and wanted to share my experience. My family purchased the light-range model of the EV9 about five months ago, and we’ve been loving it. We chose the light model mainly because of the price—it was something we were comfortable with. My wife and I work in the same building, so our daily commute is only about 20 miles total. We loved the three rows of seating and the spaciousness the vehicle provides. Since we didn’t need the extra range, we opted for the short-range model with an estimated range of 240 miles and a 70 kWh battery.

This New Year’s, my extended family decided to rent a cabin in Maryland, which meant making a 370-mile trip from Cincinnati to the cabin. While this isn’t an extremely long road trip, it was winter, so temperature could be a factor. We loaded up the car with the kids and all our gear and hit the road. I wanted to share my experience here since I don’t see many posts about the light-range model. Hopefully, this helps those considering it get an idea of what to expect.

When we left Cincinnati, I had charged the vehicle to 100%, and the range indicator showed 237 miles. Luckily, the temperature was around 40°F that morning, so the range wouldn’t be significantly affected. I routed our trip to the cabin using the ABRP app for charging guidance, which suggested three charging stops. (Your experience may vary if you use a different app.)

First Stop: Columbus, Ohio

Our first leg was about two hours to an EVgo station in Columbus. While I drove, my wife was busy installing the necessary apps for the chargers. It’s frustrating that different stations require separate apps, but it is what it is. She was a great co-pilot and ensured everything went smoothly.

As we neared the first charger, my wife noticed it was part of EVgo’s extended network. These chargers are hosted by establishments that set their own prices, which are usually higher. EVgo also offers a membership for better rates, but it only applies to their main network chargers, not the extended ones—something to keep in mind. Since this charger was part of the extended network, we rerouted to an EVgo main charger just five minutes away.

We arrived at the EVgo station with 40% charge remaining, or about 100 miles of range. Over the 120-mile drive, we had used 140 estimated miles, averaging 2.5 miles per kWh while driving at 65 mph and using the defroster on low. The station was in a strip mall with six chargers, including two 350 kW fast chargers. After connecting to the charger using the app, we waited in the car while it charged. In 19 minutes, we reached 80%, or about 180 miles of range. The stop, including a restroom break at Aldi, took 30 minutes total and cost $18.25.

Second Stop: Flying J in West Virginia

Our next stop was about 100 miles away, a one-and-a-half-hour drive to another EVgo main network charger at a Flying J gas station. We arrived with 37% charge and 80 miles of range left. This leg was smoother since the road was flat, and we didn’t need to change speeds much.

The Flying J station had eight chargers, including four fast chargers. We plugged in and went inside for coffee and snacks for the kids. After 15 minutes, the car was charged to 80%, and the cost was $18.60. This charger seemed to operate faster for some reason.

Third Stop: Jeep Dealership

The final charging stop was the one I was most worried about. It was a single Blink charger at a Jeep dealership in West Virginia. This leg included hills, traffic, and a brief use of the AC, which brought our efficiency down to 2 miles per kWh. We arrived with 40% charge and about 80 miles of range.

Unfortunately, the Blink charger was a nightmare. There was no internet or Wi-Fi at the dealership, which made it impossible to connect to the app and start charging. We tried using Wi-Fi from a gas station across the street, but even that didn’t work. After 20 minutes of frustration, we gave up. Adding to the irritation, Blink requires preloading money into your account, so we now had $20 stuck there.

We rerouted to a ChargePoint station 30 miles away and arrived with 25% charge and 40 miles of range left. This charger maxed out at 60 kW, so charging to 80% would take an hour. We decided to leave after reaching 40% (about 80 miles of range), as the cabin was only 20 minutes away.

Final Thoughts

Overall, the trip was largely a breeze, aside from the Blink charger issue. The car was very comfortable, and even after seven hours of driving, I didn’t feel stiff or sore. The three stops worked well for our young kids, and the spacious interior easily accommodated all our gear.

The shorter range did mean we needed to stop more often, but in reality, we could have made the trip in two stops. The third stop wasn’t strictly necessary—I was just being cautious since it was my first long trip with the EV9. The range indicator was fairly accurate and highly dependent on climate control usage.

I hope this helps anyone considering the light-range EV9!

I feel like everything I know about espresso doesn’t apply to the flair pro 2. I’ve read not to tamp too hard where as traditionally you can’t tamp too hard. If I try to use traditional espresso fineness with my standard recipe for the coffee I use at work for example, 19.5in and 40-42 out, only works when I grind at like a filter setting almost. For reference I’m using a fellow opus grinder. 

I tried doing 16 grams at a 2 on the fellow opus as well as at 3 which is a little course still for a traditional espresso machine. And it still chokes and is unable to pull a shot. 

For my usual recipe of 19.5 in and 40-42 out have to use 5.1 on the opus with some interior adjustments to really get it dialed in. It tastes great at this setting but I’m just wondering if this is normal for flair pro 2, and I need stop focusing on what I use on a la marzocco strada.

Anyone have advice? Should I forget what I’m used to on a strada and just do what works for the flair? 

I had a friend also in coffee come over and basically laugh at how course my grind setting was for it, so that’s what made me try more traditional grind settings etc. 

I know I should stick to if it tastes good, and I had good tiger striping etc, but just looking for other people’s experiences with the flairs that are not the 58mm one. 

Thanks, I know it’s a lengthy read I apologize

Would love to hear everyone’s story of how they came across the band. Here’s mine:

In college, I was in a student organization that would invite celebrities & make them honorary members

Katy Perry, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ke$ha, etc. we’d put them through a ceremony & they’d be honorary members

Someone invited this band called “Vampire Weekend” & I thought they were a local, up & coming band bc

-I’d never heard of them
-they were very chill / unassuming
-they had some mutual friends w our older members
-they hung out w us late into the night

they invited us to their show & I was blown away. their music was unlike anything I’d ever heard before

I thought “wow, if they keep working hard, these guys might really make it big someday” & rushed back to my dorm room to download their music on iTunes

it turned out they had the Billboard #1 album in the country

today, I looked up the setlist from the show I went to & it’s a perfect setlist, no wonder it fundamentally reshaped my musical palette

also ended up running into Ezra years later and we grabbed coffee and kept in touch for years, gave me some good insight, left me tickets to a show, etc. incredible guy & artistic genius",13,1735572664.0,Vampireweekend,4,1.0,False

1hppkyx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hppkyx,Holy New Venerable Martyr Gideon of Karakallou (+ 1818) (December 30th) ,"Saint Gideon was from the town of Kapourna near Makrynitsa of Pelion. He had pious parents, Avgerinos and Kyratza, and he was the first of eight children in the family. His baptismal name was Nicholas. Because of the heavy taxation imposed on the Christian population by the Ottomans, his father was forced to move the family to the village of Gierme, where he could save the money as needed. The Saint was then twelve years old.

His mother had a cousin named John who was a grocer in Velestino, who sought the young Nicholas to help in his store. The child worked with great diligence, grateful for the job opportunity. At one time a Turk named Ali, who frequented the grocery store, saw that the young Nicholas was bright, hard-working and obedient, and sought him from his uncle for one year to work in his harem, as he was still of a young age. The uncle refused, telling him to ask his mother for him. After one week the Turk returned angered, seized the young Nicholas by force, and took him to his house to serve in his harem.

Ali began to flatter and tempt Nicholas to accept Islam. In the end, because of his arguments and the youth's young age, he convinced him to deny Christ and to convert to Islam. Nicholas was renamed Ibrahim after his circumcision. After two months however, the child understood his fall, and he repented and cried bitterly that he accepted the circumcision of the Muslims, which he now regarded as the seal of Satan.

One night, he managed to flee secretly and go to his home. He related his situation to his father saying: “I have sinned, I have sinned from here to there and I don't want to be a Turk or be known as one.” The unfortunate father replied with tears: ""I, my Nicholas, am a poor man, I don't have the money to hide you somewhere. Tomorrow night I will take you by horse to Keramidi and I will return with a load of fish from the port of Karla so the Turks won't suspect me. You will try to go to the Holy Mountain. Who knows how I will find your mother and your siblings, because I learned that the Turks were gathering wood to burn us. Let us also die for Christ.” 

After going to Crete for a while, Nicholas began to visit the monasteries and sketes of the Holy Mountain. In the end he reached the Holy Monastery of the Apostles Peter and Paul at Karakallou, where he confessed his fall and he re-entered the Church through the anointing of Holy Chrismation and communed the Divine Mysteries. He remained in the monastery, where he became a monk and took the name Gideon. He lived with great obedience, humility, abstinence and countless ascetic struggles, which only God Who knows the heart knows, weeping continually for his fall. There he labored under the duty of cleaning and beautifying the church of the monastery. After thirty-five years of ascesis, the desire for martyrdom was lit within his heart, and with the blessings of the fathers he left the Holy Mountain and traveled to Zagora, northeast of Volos, and finally arrived at Velestino, where he had accepted Islam. There he began to play the fool.

On Holy Thursday of Holy Week, Gideon was wearing on his head a wreath of roses and flowers, simply in order to appear like a fool. In this way he presented himself before Ali, who had him made a Muslim, and confessed Christ. The Turk at first didn't recognize him, but after he did he immediately sought to arrest him and lead him to the judge. On Holy Friday the Saint, wearing a crown of flowers and holding two red eggs, appeared before the judge saying: “Christ is risen.” There at the place of judgment, he did other strange actions which caused the judge to order him beat mercilessly and to throw him out as crazy. Among the things he did was throw the coffee that was served him on the face of the judge. He sought for them to deliberately put him to death, but it was not yet the will of God. He lived for some time appearing as a fool by day, but by night he withdrew to a cave, where he performed his ascetic feats.

Gideon then decided to return to Mount Athos, and along the way he tried to irritate as many Turks as he could to achieve his desired end, but to no avail. Arriving at Karakallou, he resumed his duties as ecclesiarch. One night, as he was praying in the church alone, below the chandelier of many oil lamps (polyelaios), he heard a heavenly voice as if coming from the icon of Christ, say to him: ""Whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father Who is in the heavens."" Immediately after this revelation, Gideon received the blessing to continue his quest for martyrdom.

Standing before the governor, Gideon boldly confessed Christ after saying how he was duped in his youth by a certain Turk into accepting Islam, which he now abhorred. The governor then had Gideon imprisoned. The following day, the governor invited other Ottoman officials to come and help him examine Gideon. The officials came to Tyrnavos, and at first they used flatteries to persuade Gideon to renounce Christ, and when these did not work they turned to threats. When Gideon could not be persuaded by their threats either, they advised the governor to have him put to death. After beatings and torture, the Saint gave up his spirit. It was the 30th of December, in the year 1818.

The Christians managed to bribe the soldiers for the holy relic and they took it and buried it in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Tyrnavos. The funeral for the New Martyr was performed by Metropolitan Theodosios II of Larisa. As they were interring the martyr, a certain maiden came forth with cotton in her hand in order to gather up some of his blood, for her mistress was suffering from an incurable disease. Seeing that he was already covered in a linen shroud, she was prevented from doing this, however when Euthymios Doukas, who was the chief secretary of the governor, saw her piety, he took out his knife and cut through the sewn up linen, and with his left hand he caught some blood with the cotton. The linen was again sewn, but Euthymios observed afterwards that the entire shroud was now full of blood. In fact, warm blood was running from the bodily members of the Saint, thirty hours after the amputations and twenty-four hours after his death. All were awe-struck by this, since warm blood does not flow from a dead body. The Christians then collected the warm blood for their sanctification. Then the body of the Holy Martyr was buried behind the sacred bema of the church, with a marble candelabrum placed on top. Therefore those who besought the Saint and sought for a cure, would light a candle over his tomb and receive healing. These miracles did not only take place then, but also in our own days.

1hppj0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1hppj0h/my_mother_died_the_day_after_christmas/,My mother died the day after Christmas ,"My mother had lung cancer for 6 years. She lived with my older brother for this time. I live overseas but I came back 6x this year. I took care of her for 5 weeks in September October but also came back for Christmas and rented a place. She had ceased treatment and was given 50/50 to make it to Christmas. She had Christmas with her 2 surviving children and 2 grandchildren. However, it all went bad when my kids left.

I have a bad relationship with my brother. He treated me badly as a child, he also sexually abused me too. I was 5-7, he was 12-14. He also took drugs and caused problems for my parents. Eventually he was jailed but later he turned his life around and became successful. I thought i had forgave him but apparently not. I had my own success but he always wanted to dominate for some reason and he loves to bait me.

So, after my kids left my brother, who turned up late brought a lot of beer. We both drank and he brought up the past and began to minimize it. I asked him to avoid the topic but he did it again and again and I completely lost it calling him every name under the sun while my mother lay in the bedroom. I eventually kicked him out at 7p.m. I fell asleep at 9p.m next to my mum who had been in the room and was very frail and incapable of eating or really doing anything other than lying in bed. I was drunk and don't recall what I said of anything. The fight makes me terribly guilty, what did I say, why did I drink rather than spend every precious moment. I know it was a terrible situation to see her like that but still.

I woke at 8a.m and she had labored breathing and had somehow moved to the sofa because I snore (I think). I said we should go to hospital. She said no. I wasted an hour doing fuck all. Maybe more. Got her a coffee, then went and watched  YouTube ffs. Hoping it would get better but I didn't call an ambulance. She didnt want to move but I moved her to the bed and proped her up. At 1030a.m my brother called. More fucking around. By 11.40a.m things were bad and we took her in his vehicle to hospital. Her body went limp as we lifted her but her eyes were open, lips moving. I held her as she died in the car, maybe in the wheel chair. They attempted cpr but no point of course. 

I know she died on her terms and made Christmas but I feel I was 'negligent'. Why didn't I call an ambulance, did my tirade again my brother push her over the edge, did I say something really hurtful before I fell asleep, why didn't I hold her hand in that last hour or 2 rather than hoping (assuming) or avoiding the problem. It could never have been fixed, she was 84 and on her very last saps of energy but I still feel shockingly guilty nonetheless.

Just wasn't my best self maybe in the last 24/48 hours but I did try. It was inevitable. She hated the idea of dying in hospital. Lucky I was here rathed than her dying when i was away.. Just beating myself up I guess.",5,1735572265.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

I posted her in diff fb groups in our area as lost but no one’s claiming her so we’ve decided to keep her.  It has just been a month since she’s been with us but I am facing some challenges.

We already have 2 resident dogs. Tyrion, a senior frenchie, 11 yr old and Chewy, a havamaltese, 1 and 8month old. Both are males and both are used to a having a cat around because we had one before (she, Pickles, unfortunately passed because of sickness).

Now I understand that I cannot expect all 3 of them to get along right away, espcially Coffee because we do not know her history like if she’s used to dogs, etc.. 

The 2 dogs were obviously very curious with her because it hasn’t been long since Pickles passed and their old cat friend was very friendly. Pickles came to us when she was a kitten and used to suckle on Tyrion (yes he is a male but he has a nipple and he let her 🤷🏻‍♀️). As for Chewy, they are basically like siblings. Pickles is just a few months older than Chewy and they grew up together from being kitten/pupp to cat/dog. When Pickles passed, their sadness was noticeable.

So going back to now, there have been some slight skirmishes between the dogs and the rescue Coffee. The first week, the dogs tried to approach the cat and she’d always screech and try to scratch them as warning to keep their distance, which they are continuously doing until now. 

But just recently, I noticed that as Coffee gets more comfortable with our house, her actions have become bolder. While she more relaxed with us humans now, she’s become slightly more aggressive with Chewy only. She still the same with Tyrion (she’d hiss if either of them gets within each other’s proximity) But with Chewy, we’ve caught her more than a couple of times actively acting predator-ish with him. Chewy would just be sitting or passing by quietly and Coffee would suddenly jump at him and try to scratch/bite him.

Is this cat agrression? Important to note that they have all just been together for a month. Is there a chance for them to actually get along? I don’t mind if they don’t play just as long as they don’t fight. ",1,1735572197.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

I try to take my daughter out everyday during a holiday period, as she gets cabin fever if cooped up at home for more than a day. Basically her behaviours worsen, as she seems frustrated. So by taking her out daily, we seem to negate that issue from arising. 

However it's expensive to take them out daily, especially when  it's winter and you can't pop down to a playground. Activities for us anyway have to be indoors. Swimming is her favorite past time. To the point many have commented that's ""she's a natural one water"". Which isn't true, it's just she's been going swimming since age 2 and is now 6.

So this Christmas holidays we have been swimming (different pools) every other day. She expects after swimmimg that we go to Starbucks, where dadda will have a coffee and she will have her snacks. Then it's off home. She's then content for the rest of the day and we generally don't see any bad behavior at home. Days we don't go swimming, it's normally a indoor trampoline park or a visit to mother in laws house, still followed by Starbucks. Lol.

However this all ends up being expensive, swimming then Starbucks etc etc. Disability allowance helps with the financial strain to a degree.

Anyway, I just wondered how many other parents on here take their children out during the holidays and what activities you do with them? ",1,1735571990.0,Autism_Parenting,4,1.0,False

**_Memory transcription subject: Hailey Whitmer, UN Special Envoy_**

_Date \[standardized human time\]: November 3, 2136_

I had sent off the observations Red had made about the Venlil's genetics to my superiors not long after embarking back on Earth. I...shamefully, hadn't looked much at the situation on the ground here since the Federation bombed us. Everywhere I looked was just...sadly depressing to see.

Even though Vienna was not the most populated capital in Europe, it was still strafed during the Battle of Earth by fire where the Federation could. From what I recalled, a Federation cruiser had slipped through the bulwark line, thankfully not able to drop any antimatter bombs, but it still took potshots at the city. The damage was nowhere near close to the annihilation of places like Paris, or Berlin, but given it's population was not enough down the list, it would have been next in line, along with places like Rome, or London, had Nemesis not arrived beforehand.

But...the United Nations still needed interim headquarters after the loss of New York City. With many governments still shaken and attempting to recover after the loss of their seats of government in Europe, Austria stepped in, even damaged as it was. The flight in on shuttle showed the central areas of the city currently congested and blocked off - rubble still being cleared and structures being rebuilt. While it was nowhere near close to the yield of an antimatter bomb...there were still districts walled off from the airbrush alone, let alone where its beams hit directly.

_I could only wonder how many were dead, even from a minor bombardment like this. The Federation had aimed at the most populated areas of a city first, with rather gruesome consequences on the casualty counts as a result. I...hadn't dug into the numbers myself, despite it partially being my job as an envoy to keep updated on these things._

_With the way people were trying to collect themselves...I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people weren't quite doing their jobs right now. Either because they couldn't...or just wouldn't, in the aftermath. It was a shocking, harrowing sight, despite Vienna being one of the_ **_lucky_** _ones overall. Paris' surviving population currently occupies a glorified refugee camp, in comparison..._

But...Given the slight opening in my schedule, I had nevertheless decided to walk the streets some before I had to return to _Nemesis_. Vienna still moved, even if the city was hurt. Life still went on here, doing its best to try and move on, despite the veritable forest of burnt out buildings, emergency services, and overworked construction crews a district inward.

It was there on 'Golden Alley', that I stumbled upon an odd sight amongst all the old looking architecture, a building stuck out in the middle as looking relatively modern, if still a bit dated by our standards.

_Maybe it was from the mid 21st century? I wasn't sure, I wasn't an architecture buff much, but it was clearly newer than everything nearby._

I read the sign above it. _VR Café Goldegg._

_Ahhhhh, that'd explain it; one of those social Virtual Reality centers. Likely a bit less popular nowadays, what with how accessible VR is now. But back then, the more wild immersive setups would've drawn in customers and clients alike, while also serving as a quaint cafe on double duty. Given that whole craze with the first Four-Sense VR capabilities in the 2050's, I wouldn't be surprised if it was first built then._

A sudden urge came over me to investigate inside. The sign did say it was open, and I was a tad bit parched for luxury as of late. Maybe some pastries, a drink, and some talk would do me good!

I pushed the glass door open, and with an electronic jingle to announce it, I stepped into a room furnished in a blend of faux-rustic and mid-century styles. Across the way, adjacent to windows into a small aquarium, and among the tables and uni-treads scattered around the hall, sat a lone, younger looking lady, mumbling to herself over a tablet and a stack of papers.

I saw her head lift up, and confusion on her face as the sound of the door went off. She glanced my way, and with a surprised, but likely practiced smile, she suddenly stood. ""Ah! I was not expecting anyone today this early! Good morning! Care for a drink? Or wanted to try out one of the setups?"" She began to walk to the desk closer to the front, where I stood.

I let out a small laugh at the enthusiasm. ""Not sure, honestly! Was just...passing through while on a temporary break from work here in Vienna. But...I am a bit _thirsty_...mind giving me a rundown on the options...uhhh?..."" I tried to read for a name tag on her shirt, but I saw none.

Her glance wandered down to her own chest, as she realized I was looking for a name tag. ""Ohoho...My apologies, ma'am. My name's Isabelle, nice to meet you! And, yes, hold on, let me just get you a menu..."" She quickly reached behind the desk, and handed me a screen of my own. ""We've got what you'd usually expect from a café: pastries, coffee, tea, softer drinks, there's a few blends of smoothie I could whip up as well...and while I assume you're likely not in the mood for alcohol, given how early it is, there's some lighter stuff on its own, or _liqueur mixes_ I could customize to your liking, if you are. Might take me a second though, you've sadly caught me only a half-hour past opening, and I haven't prepped everything; busy and all that...""

I waved her off politely. ""No, no, nothing to worry about! I'm likely just good with tea."" I glanced at the menu. ""...Something gentle, mellow, sweet...maybe a _white peony?_...""

She smiled ""Of course! Would you like anything added to it-"" She pointed at the auxiliary options on the tablet menu itself. ""-or any special steep?""

I hummed in thought for a moment. ""No..._mmmh_...well...maybe honey?"" I slid the tablet to her. ""Yeah, just honey will do, please. I'm hip, but I'm not too hip to care about the temp. Whatever you think's best on the steep.""

As she took the order, and began making it over the kettle at the back, she spoke. ""So...what brings you to Vienna? Your German is impeccable, but the accent doesn't sound local. Are you by chance one of those UN folk?"" Her gaze wandered up from the kettle towards me directly. ""I know they've moved headquarters here recently. Not sure _why exactly,_ given the inner city is a frightful affair. But...Chancellor Steindl was quite adamant that London did not get it.""

My head perked at that. ""Good deduction, yes! I'm an envoy for the UN; not exactly sure how much I can talk about it beyond that, but I am in on official business, and not a local one."" I set my phone down, and perched my elbows on the table as I focused on her. ""Hope it's not been giving you folk much trouble..."" I offered in courteous humor.

She smirked at that. ""Oh you're all kinds of _trouble_. But I'd still prefer it over Britain, at the moment. Have you heard some of the rhetoric coming out of that place? It's insane! I'm not much a fan of the Federation either, I get their anger on that, but there's been local talk about even our own _allies_ not being worth the risk of the galaxy!""

_I sighed at that. How utterly_ **_familiar_** _sentiments to rally against down here given the company I was playing middleman to on Nemesis_...

""Yeah, it's all fucked, isn't it?"" I responded. ""Like, seriously, mind if I vent a bit?""

At her nod, I kept going. ""The whole _Humanity First_ thing that's been springing up as-of late. I do get it, God knows I'm pissed at the galaxy too. But that party seems a bit..._unhinged_ in its support, too. Especially just going for the throat like it has on the 'UN rolling over to Venlil Prime's demands'. _Please!_ We both have an invested interest in not stepping on eachothers toes, and Governor Tarva isn't the sort to do that anywho! Why are they so ruthlessly attacking the UN for doing what it can when we're recovering, even if it inconveniently looks like we're bending to the whims of the Venlil for it?""

An audible sigh of disgust again left my lips. _""Ugh_...call it being sick of the mindset, but I've been _swamped_ in it as of late. It's irritating to think that humanity has a portion of people that watched the Venlil throw their fleet in front of ours above Earth, or the Zurulians perform copious amounts of crisis aid, and yet think we ought to _toss them out_ along with the rest of the galaxy for merely being aliens! Have they not heard of 'don't throw the baby out with the bathwater'!?""

""Mmmhmmm."" Isabelle hummed. ""Sounds about right to me; can't help but hate, even with the ones doing good...we're a fickle thing, when the life we love is taken from us."" I heard her begin to pour the kettle into a cup, and walked over to the table I sat at with a cup in hand. ""Your tea's ready, by the way. Let me know if it needs anything!""

_My brain crawled to a halt as I realized what she had said. It was...oddly on point with what I had been thinking about Red, lately. How she seemed so out of touch, and angry for it, even when she had some semblance of a Humanity to talk with, again. Was Isabelle possibly a good person to ask?_...

""Thank you, but please; hold on a second."" I pulled a chair out next to me and offered it up. ""I'm actually a tad bit curious about something, even if it's mildly off-topic. Mind if I ask?""

Isabelle put a hand to her heart, in surprise. ""Oh? No, go ahead, I can talk! The paperwork can wait, I've got a whole business day ahead of myself!"" She smiled.

I started back up. ""Well...it's mostly about exactly the big, gaping wreck of the inner district, actually, and the fallout of such."" I saw her features fall a bit at that, but she didn't look offended. ""I...obviously, have never been to Vienna before this, myself. While my job takes me to a lot of places, I've never stopped _here_, until the UN declared this would be a temporary HQ until we sorted something out in the mess...""

_I tried to consider how to word this. Isabelle seemed like a people person, and while I was too, I felt like my brain was too wracked on other details to get an answer to this. But...classification meant I couldn't just be clear about it._

""I've...got someone in a similar boat to the whole ordeal, except a lot worse. A recent acquaintance in my life, sadly dumped a decent ton on my head. Lost their home...their friends, family...the like. You saw how I'm not too fond of that _Humanity First_ party rhetoric. I'm afraid they're likely going to tumble right down into that abyss, if I don't do anything to help them. They seem so...lost in the wake of losing everything. But...I'm not exactly certain how I can help them, when I so deeply understand how wrong it was to have so much robbed from them. It all feels so...easy to justify for their sake, even if not for my own. But...it often feels like they don't even want help when I offer it.""

I looked into her eyes. ""I don't feel like I know them enough to figure out an answer, or a solution. There's just so much of a road map ahead to that problem that I feel overwhelmed even where to _start_...Do you by any chance know how I might try and get closer to them on that front? To help them stay away from that path? I'm sorry if this is a bit vague, and an odd question to ask a complete stranger, but...you seem good with people-""

_""Oh...dear...""_ she said in a concerned tone. ""You're really hitting me with a tough question out of the blue, aren't you?""

I nodded sadly, and Isabelle whistled in thought as she stared at the ceiling. ""I...don't exactly know how I'd approach that situation...given I'm not you. I don't really know the specifics, but...you mentioned them losing a lot. It might...help, to get their perspective on exactly what they have lost. Put yourself in their shoes, so to speak. Maybe...ask them to open up a bit on exactly _what_ their past life was like, before they lost it all? Would probably be the best place to start...""

She shrugged after. ""Past that, I'd need more details, but you said you don't know them very well, by your own admittance. I assume that means there's not much to give. But clearly they're important to you if you're asking this."" She pointed at the VR sets aside the wall. ""I know it sounds a bit like I'm shilling our products or services out saying this, but.. if the person you know is any bit tech-savvy, they might be able to _literally build_ a image of the place they once had with a VR program. Could consider learning what they felt in detail through that, if they put in the effort to rebuild it. But...obviously that's a bit of involvement, and somewhat insensitive to ask, compared to just having a honest talk, or sharing pictures, or something-""

_Wait a damn minute...that's PERFECT! I hardly know anything about the world Red came from, except the details she gave on first contact, and some vague comparisons beyond that. What if I took a virtual reality suit...and had her_ **_show_** _me exactly what her Earth was like?..._

_...Or...is like, now. Assuming it's still there...Wait, is Earth even still there!? Or has it been atomized to nothing, given how scary the firepower she's carrying?! I didn't exactly know, and if I was to 'envoy' better with her, I ought to figure this out!_

""Actually..."" I interrupted her, as I stood up and walked towards that wall of VR suits. ""...I think you might've just stumbled into the perfect answer. Hey - how much do these _cost?""_ I asked, digging into my pocket for a wallet.

**+READING MAIN SEQ.MEM+**

**+ADDENDUM: ADJUSTED DATE 3.11.2136+**

_My mind hummed with concern as I dove into the physical equations of subspace. While being in this universe awakened me to a potential I would have never thought possible in faster-than-light technology, I was beginning to realize something concerning, as I stumbled through the first iteration and design of a subspace engine; a double-edge to the sword of the capabilities it offered:_

_Subspace Theory implied my understanding of observable physics was_ **_wrong here._**

_It was not on a deeply fundamental level, as far as I could tell. Gravity didn't repulse rather than attract, nor did the Standard Model yield less or more basic particles than expected. But...there was something...off about this universe, likely in its geometry. But said internal geometry was somehow extending to a change in some constants I realized from my understanding of shockspace._

_Shockspace, as far as my theories had deduced, took an intense amount of energy to even open a microscopic rift in. A glut that was required from its necessarily higher vacuum energy density, compared to this reality; like trying to swim upriver against a current. To expand it even further into the scales necessary to subsume a ship into reached such comical scales of power generation that it necessitated nearly two different power revolutions before the shift drive designs could be put to use by the Confederacy._

_Albert Dietrich had pioneered a lot of the physical math behind the first iterations, even if unintentionally. But the problem between shockspace and subspace I was chewing on related foremost to his most important practical observation that shockspace ran headfirst into: the Spacelike Gravitic Potential terms._

_Due to the quirks in the fundamental equations to gravity as we knew them, the universe described a behavior wherein, as one traveled more or less distant from this layer of reality, the gravitational constant was actually a_ **_variable_** _in a directly proportional aspect. As one needed to enter higher dimensions in order to occupy shockspace, you ran headfirst into the practical application of this term, as your absolute scalar displacement from this layer of reality increased._

_Gravity, as a result of being so distant from realspace, was intensified in shockspace by_ **_four orders of magnitude minimum_**_, compared to realspace. It lead to the very real problems of being unable to warp in close to a system without being torn apart, as natural scalar curvature was amplified to degrees that would tear and compress your ship to shreds as you attempted to occupy said space, even if transitioning back to realspace._

_But...the subspace equations said something odd. The general idea of Albert Dietrich's theories holds for subspace...but the constants are different. Something about the invariant, hyperspherical geometry of this universe meant that subspace was leagues closer in displacement to realspace than shockspace. But...it also did unexpected things, calculating out these changes to the constants involved in Dietrich's theories as related to shockspace, with values derived from subspace theory:_

_It implied shockspace was far,_ **_far closer_** _to this layer of realspace in this universe, than in my own reality. And that had...concerning implications. Namely, that shockspace was far easier to open a rift into than normal. The river still had to be swam up, but the distance one needed to reach a calmer flow was meters where it was once kilometers._

**_So_** _easy, in fact, that the vacuum energy density would naturally be a dominating term in any interaction over the energy used to open and stabilize said rift, unless it was already immensely large. A scaled-up example of the problem of the instability found in microscopic rifts into shockspace found in my reality. One could not create a rift with too little energy, because it would either fizzle out into nothing...or balloon in volatility. This problem was tackled in the application of a rift with the projected energies used in say...a breach core._

_It was very much possible that turning on my breach core would create a rift capable of subsuming its own containment infrastructure. Of even subsuming an entire section of my shipself. I could...temporarily...mitigate it, by running the breach core on the lowest tap of power possible. But if it were ever to flux and accidentally shift, demanding the power rise to remain stable_...

_There was a possibility I would not live to fix it._

_My breach core still remained inactive, damaged, inoperable as I was now. I ran entirely off the auxiliary cold fusion tower reactors while in drydock, and they worked well enough. But...eventually, it would need to be repaired. I could not maintain combat effectiveness on a reactor output that small._

_I could renovate it, purposefully cripple its capabilities such as to prevent it becoming a live core detonation on the spot. Or consider the easy application of antimatter this universe has inexplicably stumbled upon, once I find out how their method works. But...my mission still demands that at some point, I find my way back to my own universe, and continue the long war. But if I cripple myself in order to avoid my own heart beating to death...how will I return home?..._

...**_Can_** _I even return home?_...

..._I do not know._

_But as I tackle this problem, on top of many others, I focus on the image of Hailey's shuttle returning to my hangar bay. As the hatch opened upwards, the wing-door like design swinging with the hiss of pressure differences, I saw Hailey walk out carrying a box under each arm...and turning to a hangar camera with a smug grin on her face._

..._I trust Hailey...but I do not trust a grin_ **_that_** _smug. It reeks of plotting._

""Heyyyyy Red?..."" She said, in an almost sing-song voice. ""Hypothetically speaking...how proficient are you with virtual reality?""

_Very much of plotting._

I engaged a speaker close to her. ""I am capable of both its usage, and its programming. Why do you ask?""

Her grin widened slightly, as she finally set down the strain of carrying both boxes at once with a _huff_. ""I happened to stumble onto a place down in Vienna while there was a gap in schedule. Nice, quaint little VR cafe; pleasant experience overall, honestly. But...it gave me an idea actually!""

She began to open the top of one box, and rife through its contents. Cordage...visor...full body suit. ""Check it out! A full virtual tactile-suit! So state of the art, it can even manage taste!...Uh...somehow...."" She shook herself. ""But nevertheless, I got an idea to try and get to know you a little better. I've _heard_ about the United Earth Confederacy through briefings, trivia, and first contact with you...but I haven't really _experienced it_, so to speak. But...if you were to-""

_Really, that was what you were plotting about?_

""-Make a virtual reality landscape, then you could experience it, I get the idea, Hailey."" I finished for her. I began to compile a list of models and make of each virtual reality suit piece I could identify out of an online catalogue, in search of the program it used for compatibility-sake. ""Better question: how much did you _pay_ for all this?""

Her grin finally faltered from that, but she just looked frustrated at that. _""A pretty penny,_ Red. I'd be skimping a bit on groceries to eat the dent in my paycheck were I not being provided for by the government, currently! So don't shirk this! I'm not letting this purchase go to waste!""

_I had an opportunity to turn this around on her, in a humorous way. But I figured a more deadpan delivery would sting just a gram more._

_I decided to indulge in it, if she was going to attempt to strongman me into this idea as she tried with many. A vain, small payback to the annoyance of regular therapy she thrust upon me. Schadenfreude paid in kind._

A holographic projection came up, of a classic model of virtual reality suitage, directly in front of her. ""Hailey...I could've made you a virtual reality apparatus in mere _minutes_ for free.""

She blinked for a moment, before palming at her pocket for her wallet. I could see her eyes slightly waver through a secondary camera as she looked into a distinctly far _emptier_ wallet than when I had last seen it.

She whispered in very much attempted, but unsuccessfully hidden pain not long after.

_""...Oh.""_

When I was 11, I rapidly gained weight. Since then, I have struggled with my health and body image, as through the years, I have continuously gained, gained, gained, despite my best efforts--I do cardio 2.5 hours a week, weight lifting 1 hour a week, and walk two miles every morning and evening. I eat a PCOS-friendly diet after being diagnosed earlier this year--no coffee, no alcohol, switched to tea, etc. etc. I also go to bed every night around 10, wake up at 6-7:30. My efforts to lose weight have cost me friendships, as nobody in college wants to hang out with a girl that turns into a pumpkin before midnight, lol. Despite my best efforts, I'm still gaining, and 200lbs is heading toward me fast. Being only 5'3, it's been a huge burden not only physically, but mentally, and it upsets me that my mobility is becoming increasingly limited when I do my usual HIIT workouts.

I have an appointment January 8 to speak with my physician about weight loss, and some labs she had done not too long ago (surprise surprise, my insulin resistance is ""just fine""). I want to make a good argument to be put on Zepbound specifically. What are some things you discussed with your doctors that helped you in being prescribed? I've already made a portfolio of photos from when I was 11 to now (22) showcasing the continuous gain, alongside my workout histories on my phone and macronutrient tracker. Do you feel this will be effective? I'm terrified of being shut down--I'm at a loss of what to do. 

Thanks in advance! Any and all advice will be appreciated.",3,1735571422.0,Zepbound,6,1.0,False

It was *EXTREMELY* detailed, breaking down every album to that point with interviews and photos. I remember that the cover had some Yellow on it, and I believe there was a photo of the band walking towards the camera in a Beatles-esque way if I remember correctly.

I had bought it at  Barnes & Noble, and gave it away at some point just because of moving around a lot.

I cannot for the life of me find a copy of the book I'm referring to online, there are too many other Sabbath books. Does anyone know the specific one I am referring to?

School holidays are here, and while the kids are thrilled, parents often find themselves scrambling to answer the dreaded question: “What are we doing today?” 

Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered with these 10 unique (and surprisingly fun!) activities to keep the kids entertained and your sanity intact. 👇

# 1. Host an “International Day” 🌍

Pick a country, learn a few fun facts, and dive in! Cook the food, learn a dance, or try saying “hello” in the language. Bonus: You’ll feel like you went on vacation without ever leaving the house.

# 2. Build a Living Room Obstacle Course 🏃‍♂️

Turn furniture into jungle gyms, pillows into lava rocks, and hallways into hurdles. It’s cardio for them, and coffee time for you. Everyone wins.

# 3. Create a Backyard Mini Golf Course ⛳

With a few cups, sticks, and creative use of garden tools, your backyard (or hallway!) can become a mini-putt paradise. Loser has to clean up the course.

# 4. Organize a “Yes Day” 🙋

Give the kids control (within reason!). Yes to pancakes for dinner, yes to building forts, yes to dancing in pajamas. They’ll love the freedom, and you’ll get cool parent points for years.

# 5. Make a Time Capsule 🕰️

Have the kids gather drawings, letters to their future selves, and random trinkets. Bury it in the yard (or just hide it in the closet), then promise to open it together in a year.

# 6. Have a Crazy Food Challenge 🍕🍩

Ever wondered what pizza with marshmallows tastes like? Let the kids invent wild recipes and *bravely* taste-test them. Just keep a backup frozen meal handy—just in case.

# 7. Host a Family Movie Marathon 🎥

But make it *extra* special: homemade tickets, popcorn in fancy bowls, and everyone gets to dress as a character from the movie lineup. Yes, dad, you *do* have to be Elsa.

# 8. Try a Reverse Hide-and-Seek Game 🕵️‍♀️

One person hides, and everyone else looks for them. But here’s the twist: once you find the hider, you squeeze in and hide with them until the last seeker finds the *sardine pile*.

# 9. DIY Science Lab 🔬

Make slime, explode some baking soda volcanoes, or create rainbow milk with food coloring and dish soap. It’s messy, educational, and hilarious—what’s not to love?

# 10. Plan a “No Tech Treasure Hunt” 🗺️

Unleash your inner pirate! Draw a treasure map, create silly clues, and hide a special prize (even if it’s just snacks). X marks the spot, and you’ve just bought yourself hours of peace.

**Pro Tip:** Don’t overthink it—kids love creativity more than perfection. Whether you’re baking cookies that look like monsters or having a “clean the house with silly hats” contest, they’ll remember the laughter way more than the activity itself.

✨ What’s your favorite thing to do with kids during the holidays? Got any quirky traditions?

1hpp3md,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeChat/comments/1hpp3md/okay_i_admit_defeat/,"Okay, I admit defeat...","I \*finally\* get why all of you flip so hard over Tamura. I get it. 

Initially I wrote him off b/c I don't really get hot & bothered over the whole gangster/mobster trope. Just not a thing I find hot. (I like bad boys, just... not that flavor) Yeah he's hella fine looking and he has a dye job I'm very jealous of myself, but... I figured he was gonna be the same gun-toting, overcompensating badass, fake ""Yakuza"" type personality and, ew no thanks....

That is until.... this latest christmas event.....

I failed hardcore at completing the Halloween one in time so I SWORE I'd finish this one!! Luckily I was already matched with about 4 of the chosen male characters so that gave me a quick bump! Then I just had to hobble through a few more (and I picked up a couple of the ladies as well).

COLOR ME EMBARRASSED when I come to find I actually REALLY liked some of these dudes who y'all thirst after so hard that I thought I'd hate!!  XD

So, now I have WAY TOO MANY matches because I liked them so much and Tamura is one of them. Damn. He's actually adorable. WTF? Honestly Jeremiah is more the way I imagine Tamura to be, but even then he's sticking around too for now. UGH! Why does this game have to have so many good stories that surprise me!?!? :P

I mean... how could I not love a guy who'd allow himself to be subjected to this? I practically looked like this for xmas at work myself! (I need this sweater actually)

I’m 28 weeks and I know that stomach is smaller, hormones delay digestion, etc. But this seems excessive.

Example: i had an omelet around 1pm. Went out to dinner and had soup and salmon with salad greens. Followed by a cup of coffee.

Two hours later, I felt so incredibly full. I went to bed (4hrs after 1st dinner bite) and thought I was going to throw up so I had to pace the bathroom, waiting for the inevitable. 

This is my second pregnancy and I definitely did not feel this incredible sense of fullness and nausea with my first. Is this just coincidence or somehow related to the GD diet?

Looking for some suggestions for hobbies (preferably yung hindi mabigat sa bulsa 🥹).

I used to play badminton, paint, and write for fun (not saying that I’m good tho) but I don’t have the time anymore. 🥲 I’m currently trying to get back to reading while binge-watching some TV series (Superstore and House) but I’d like to explore other hobbies too! 

Some stuff about me (if it well help haha):

So, I met this guy at uni.  I didn't talk to him much because I was dating someone at the time. I started to like him suddenly and unexpectedly. We started texting as colleagues and he never fails to make me laugh. During class he was playing with my computer cables and asked me ""*Name* does your mouse work?"" ""*Name* check your keyboard."". He was basically sabotaging me. Also he was late to class and I told him that we'll have a quiz (I meant next week) and he got scared and thought I meant in that very moment, I turned to him and said that it will be next week. Then he slapped me on my lower back and said ""Don't joke with me like that."". Over text he said ""We'll go out for coffee after maths 😉."" He was quite persistent. We also make eye contact all the time. When he sits next to me he is constantly moving, bounces his leg up and down or fixes his hair or his hoodie. He also is always offering to help me study or explain anything that I don't understand. He lives in a different city and has told me that he wants to drive me to his city so we could have coffee there. He is also really attentive and noticed that my eyes were watery and asked me if I was okay. He also drove me home once cause I couldn't find any transportation. He initiates convos sometimes but only about uni and he doesn't ask me how I am or what I'm doing unless I ask him first. It's like he's closed off, maybe he's scared because he's from a different city. It's like he's hot and cold, one moment and so closed off the next. He has touched my lower back and my shoulder on several occasions where he was playfully joking. Does he have feelings for me?",1,1735570989.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1hpp12e,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1hpp12e/christianity_permits_us_to_call_bad_things_good/,"Christianity Permits Us To Call ""Bad"" Things ""Good""","Good morning! (or whenever you are!)

[I discuss these ideas over a cup of coffee this morning if you prefer to engage via audio/video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkLCt3NWBdM)

I am reaching out to discuss the idea of how Christianity enables us to call ""bad"" things ""good"".

Let's define our terms. When I say something is ""good"" or ""bad"" I am really referring to actions which either increase someone's wellbeing, or decrease it.

A good action is one that increases the wellbeing of others.

I am not interested in delving into a philosophical conversation regarding the notion of ""good"" and ""bad"" because if we cannot agree that making people experience less suffering is a ""good"" thing then I don't know if we will agree on much else.

Ill leave that chat for the true philosophers.

Also, I am not interested in increasing the wellbeing of someone after death. Since I cannot validate an after life, Ill consider all discussion about an afterlife to be pure speculation.

Here, I am simply going to discuss the practical behavior Yahweh from the Old Testament.

We are going to bring some of the biblical narratives into our modern world and see if we think them to be ""good"" in the same way we think them to be ""good"" in the old testament.

The classic, the ultimate, slaughter of the Canaanites will be our first topic.

God commands the Israelites to cleanse the land of the filthy, wicked Canaanites.

Let's bring that into our modern world. I don't want to disrespect anyone's homeland so lets imagine a nasty country called ""The Land.""

Okay, now lets imagine the people on ""The Land"" are participating in all kinds of wicked sin.

The people on ""The Land"" are greedy, self serving. They are less interested in the family unit and more interested in profit and living a luxury lifestyle. They spend more money in a day than most people get to spend in a month. They have everything they could ever want yet they still complain for more.

Sound familiar? That's the point.

Now, lets imagine a nation of wanders for God. They do not have a homeland, but they feel God has told them they will wander across a homeland soon. They cross a great river and all agree, ""this is the place God commands us to call home""

But, there's a problem. All these people are on their new homeland. What shall we do God? ""Kill them all, they deserve it for their sins are great.""

Some of the wanders ask: ""God, you want us to kill them all? Even the children, the innocent?""

""Yes cleanse the land for you God has commanded you to do so""

==========

We wake up and turn on the news. ""Group of wanders slaughtering inhabitants of The Land on the command of God""

How do you feel? Do you believe the wanders when they say, ""God told us to"" or are you repulsed?

Keep in mind, all of this plays out in a time period where GPS and modern navigation does not exist. These people do not know anything about the Canaanites other than what they feel like God has told them about.

So picture that, the group of wanders don't even really know a lot about the Land they are invading.

==========

I was planning on bringing more stories into this, but I feel like the one listed above paints the picture quite nicely.

Here is my conclusion:

If you say that Yahweh commanded bad things, then he is not all good. So you are now in the position to say, ""The slaughter of the Canaanites was good"" along with a ton of other events which are reported in the bible.",5,1735570864.0,DebateReligion,16,0.73,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. Right now I've been playing around with some watercolors. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I had a really tough year in 2023. Time unemployed and earning minimum wage. Sleeping on my brothers couch - whilst still paying rent as unfortunately he lost his job soon before I did. We scrapped together and survived. 

I moved out from my brother in February and have saved $16k. 

I am honestly so proud of the hard work I put in this year to get here. Next year is going to be an even bigger one.   
I had 3 jobs this year, my current one I have had since March. I am earning more than I ever had before. I am debt free (borrowed $200 from my brother last year to get to work).

I had a few things happen. 

I got laid off from my new job in March and they paid me for the next month without being employed. The first day I started knocked on random peoples doors -messaging random people on Linkedin to work in the area I wanted too. Many people were incredibly helpful and gave me a call or coffee - they were happy to share wisdom. One invited me for a coffee  near his house on a Thursday afternoon. He gave me great advice and feedback on my unsolicited message. I left confident I knew what to do as I looked to start my own business whilst bartending. The next day he called me up and asked me to come in to the office on the Monday (1 week after being laid off). I spoke to him and the other director and they said they could use an extra hand with a few aspects so I should maybe work as a contractor for 4 weeks, where they would cover my expenses (it was what I earned a week bartending - so I knew I could survive). At the end of it they offered me a great job. 

Then I got a decent bonus of $2.5k at the end of the year which helped a lot. They also have amazing schemes and matches which helped me save.

I know this is a little brag - happy to answer any questions. Just very proud of where I have gotten to from where I am. ",40,1735570416.0,CalebHammer,0,0.98,False
1hpov30,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1hpov30/advice_for_those_wanting_to_raid_especially_pc/,Advice for those wanting to raid (Especially PC Users),"I've run the raid more times than I can count and I've farmed the first boss even more than that.  There is literally not a single item that drops in the raids that I need for anything more than scrapping to learn 4 star armor mods.  I don't say this as a flex, rather to establish a little bit of cred that I've figured a thing or two out along the way.

* Have a decent build - it doesn't have to be perfect, just decent.
   * You don't need 6 legendary perks ranked all the way up.
   * You don't need a full set of perfect armor.
   * You just need good enough.
* Level is pretty much irrelevant
   * I'd gladly take a well played level 50 over a poorly played level 1000 on the raid.
   * There are DPS gates and survival gates you must be able to pass, beyond that its just efficiency gained.  
   * If your team can kill the first boss in 4 DPS phases you can clear all but the snake.
   * The snake comes down to surviving the poison and being able to switch targets to the tail.
* Communication is Key
   * I don't care if you can't speak - but you should at least be able to hear team chat.
   * Lacking team chat you need to be johnny on the spot with some emotes to indicate you're ready and communicate.
   * If you can't communicate you better know the encounters well enough to intuitively know how to help succeed.
* Team Medic is a perk that goes a LONG ways, someone in the group should have and share this one.  The raid gives you so many stimpacks, and if you are short at the start just look outside Gleaming Depths - I guarantee you'll find a loot bag with hundreds in it.
* Heavy Weapons may be king, but VATS heavy weapon is the Queen.
   * Yes the cost is AP consumables and fusion core consumption, but this makes your DPS way more efficient.

Learn what consumable are available and use them.  The top performing players aren't better equipped or better built than you are, they are consuming buffs at an alarming rate.  Saturday and Sunday I consumed about 1200 canned coffee, emptied and filled my cryo freezer 3 times and destroyed my stockpile of Nuka Quantums.

More than anything understand the encounters and your role in them.

* EN06
   * Hide behind the walls to avoid damage, or soak it and spam stimpacks.
   * Use VATS to target the shield even when he's facing you.
   * Run to safe rooms when the room overheats - position yourself where you can see one of the other rooms besides the one close to you, then you can quickly check when danger time hits.
* The Drill
   * No one guards until the threat escalates.
   * Flamers are amazing for blowing up the rats - as you come and go for fuel be ready to flamer any rats you see, this reduces damage to drill.
   * Sprint.  Seriously  sprint a lot - this is a race, RUN!
   * Have the Speed Demon mutation.... see previous point.
* Squad Epsilon
   * Only 2 of the shield generators get heal bots... the moment the shields come back up someone needs to be moving towards each.
   * The Squad does pretty poor DPS overall.
   * The Squad soaks your AP up hard, I use a LOT of coffee to keep my DPS up and running on this encounter.
* Research Lab
   * Pay attention to your team, stay together and drag the mole man past small crystals blowing them up as you do.
   * Team Medic helps a lot here - spamming timpacks heals everyone.
   * The mole man can be killed with only the small crystals of 1 half of the lab
   * Once the danger of death is gone tank the trash under the big crystals until you get both deathclaws there and then blow the big crystals up.  2 kills the rest of the trash, you have 3 and half the facility if any stragglers exist.
* Scorchtongue
   * Don't stand in the spit.
   * Seriously, don't stand in the spit.
   * Got Funky Duds?  You can stand in the spit.
   * DPS his eyes with VATS.
   * If he's facing you and rears back, sprint laterally to avoid a big hit.
   * Don't stand too close - you lose DPS when he lunges and this makes the tail harder to DPS when it's across from him.
   * Don't stand too far back - you risk being blown into the toxic pond before you can jump.  Ideally you want to be 2 pushbacks from the toxic pond.
   * DPS the tail - it goes down easy with VATS but if you're being pushed back at the same time having everyone on it helps a lot.
   * If you miss the tail it's not the end of the world - get away from where it hit because the ponds getting bigger.
   * Don't stand in the spit.

So this is a lot to keep in mind, but it's end game content.  The rewards are worth it and the fights are actually challenging compared to all the other content I've seen.  I've had teams that can clear the entire place in 15-20 minutes and I've had newbie teams that take 30-45 but are just as successful.  Those groups that communicate always win.

Oh and like the other post I saw today said - if you wipe don't be a d-bag.  It's a game, people are human, try to enjoy it!

- gained 10lb(I was normal weight but now overweight, from dexa scan, fat went up from 26% to 33%, muscle decreased even work out 3 days/week)
- triglycerides went up from 70 to 165, TC 500’s hdl 79 (same as previous) ldl 400. Cortisol/thyroid normal on blood work
- no energy, always tired, leg heaviness even with supplements of magnesium/salt and electrolytes

- skin got worse, acne breakout
- still diarrhea everyday. Looks like not fat adapted?

His mom who is a single mom to two boys and who I get along with well has recently asked my husband to have a one on one dinner with her once a month. I don’t want to give away our exact careers because I don’t want to give my identity away but let’s just say my husband works overnights Monday-Friday and I work days from 7:30-4. By the time I get home from work my husband is already gone for work and so really the only time I have to spend time with him is Saturday when he wakes up and Sunday all day. So really that’s 8 dinners a month. I’m pretty annoyed that his mom being very much aware of her son’s and DIL’s schedule is asking to take away yet another evening from my husband. It would be different if I was invited to these dinners. I feel like this is a big ask when we as husband and wife barely get time together and to eat together. Heck even if I was invited I would be a bit annoyed that 25% of our time we get as husband and wife were spent with his mother. Let alone me not being invited. I feel like his mom isn’t being understanding of our time together and is causing issues in our marriage. I feel it’s weird that she wants to plan monthly dinners every month where her son has to tell his wife, “sorry I’m having dinner/going out to eat with my mom but you aren’t invited.”

And yes I totally get she was a single mom who raised two boys and that’s amazing and she is a great woman and we get alone well however as bad as this might make me sound I don’t feel like that gives her the right knowing our strict schedules to monopolize so much of his time and not invite his wife to these dinners. Yes my husband and I together about 3-4 times a year will take her out and treat her bc of all she has done for my husband growing up and to show our appreciation. Sometimes on Saturdays here and there we will stop by. I also am not a parent so I completely understand the desire to have alone time with your child so sometimes on Sunday mornings my husband will pop over alone to say hi or for coffee. But to have a routine dinner plan where your child’s spouse is excluded if hurtful. I’m also hurt that his mother knowing our schedule would try and take the little time we have together away especially considering she seems to like me a lot and we get along well. 

My husband is annoyed as well but does struggle with setting boundaries at times and saying no to his mother. A habit I’m trying to break him out of. I feel like as his wife my feelings should be coming first especially with the little time we get together. I’m very annoyed that his mom is trying to monopolize so much of my husband’s time.

David Mercer wasn’t supposed to be on ShadowRoot. He knew better than to mess around on sketchy deep-web forums. But when you’re a cybersecurity grad student writing a thesis on the digital underworld, you go where the material is. It was late—well past midnight—when he found the link buried in an obscure thread.

The site was bare-bones, just black text on a gray background. It looked like something from the early days of the internet. There were the usual deep-web discussions: hacking tutorials, stolen data exchanges, and conspiracy theories. But one thread near the bottom of the page caught his attention: “We See You.”

The post was a single line of text:

> ""Reply if you’re curious. We’ll prove it.""



David leaned back in his chair, smirking. It was classic bait. He debated ignoring it, but his curiosity got the better of him. He typed:

> ""Alright, prove it. Who am I?""



Seconds passed. Then his phone buzzed on the desk.

His heart skipped. He hadn’t given the site any personal information. He picked up the phone and read the message from an unknown number:

> ""Hi, David Mercer. Did you enjoy your caramel latte at Café Bell this morning?""



The smile slid off his face. Café Bell wasn’t a Starbucks or some chain; it was a tiny, hole-in-the-wall spot near his apartment. No one could have guessed that detail. He looked around his dimly lit apartment. The blinds were closed, the door locked. No way anyone had been watching him.

He typed back:

> ""Who is this? How do you know me?""



Another text came immediately:

> ""We’ve been watching you for weeks. Your passwords are embarrassing, by the way.""



Before David could respond, another message arrived—a string of characters he recognized immediately. It was the password for his bank account.

> ""Check your balance. I left you a gift.""



Shaking, David logged in. His balance was normal, except for a single deposit of $1, labeled Watcher007. His fingers trembled as he typed his reply:

> ""What do you want?""



> ""Just watching. You’re fascinating.""



He shut off his phone, unplugged his router, and sat in the silence of his apartment. But the texts didn’t stop. Over the next few days, they came at all hours, always from a blocked number.

> ""Lock your door tonight. You forgot last night.""
""That gray hoodie you wore today suits you.""
""Kara’s lying to you, by the way. She’s not right for you.""



Kara. His girlfriend. They’d been together for six months, and things were rocky. But there was no way a random stalker could know that. David confronted her about it, asking if she’d told anyone about him or their relationship. She denied everything, but the stress was too much. He ended things that night, partly out of fear for her safety—and partly because he couldn’t shake the feeling that the Watcher was right.

The texts escalated. One night, David came home to find a package on his doorstep. It was unmarked, just a plain brown box. Inside was a USB drive. Against his better judgment, he plugged it into an old laptop. A single video file popped up, titled ""LIVE.""

He clicked it. The footage was grainy but clear enough: it showed his apartment. The video was live, and it was showing him—right then—sitting at his desk. He stared at the screen, frozen. In the video, something moved behind him. A dark figure, hooded, stepped into frame and reached toward him.

David spun around, heart pounding. Nothing. He was alone. When he turned back to the screen, the video had changed. It now showed him sleeping in his bed. The hooded figure was standing over him, watching.

The screen went black, and a message appeared:

> ""You can’t run, David. You’re ours now.""



David didn’t sleep that night. The next morning, he packed a bag and left the city, abandoning his apartment, his phone, and everything else that could tie him to his old life. He moved to a small town a thousand miles away, using cash for everything and a fake name for the lease on a tiny studio apartment.

For a while, it seemed to work. He rebuilt his life, taking a job at a local coffee shop. He never went online, never used a smartphone. The paranoia faded, and he started to feel safe.

Until one night, when his new phone buzzed. It was a burner he’d bought at a gas station, untraceable, or so he thought. The message was from a blocked number.

> ""Hi, Daniel. Or should I call you David? We see you.""



David dropped the phone, his chest tightening as his surroundings blurred. His pulse thundered in his ears as another message came through:

> ""Running was smart. But it won’t save you. We’re patient. We’ll see you soon.""



That night, David sat in the dark, waiting for the knock on the door that never came. But the texts didn’t stop, and deep down, he knew it was only a matter of time before the Watcher found him again.

I feel like everything has been an uphill battle. I never had weight issues until I graduated high school and started working. It seemed like that instantly targeted cystic acne and weight gain. And of course I'm sure I started eating more. I was able to lose that weight in the course of a year while my acne seemed to worsen and then everything finally plateaued and I was fine with myself sitting between 115-119. To lose the weight I heavily restricted my calories and worked out for about an hour nearly every single day. I was able to maintain without counting calories for a year. 

That was in 2019. COVID happened and I wasn't weighing myself anymore. I had to move back into an abusive environment and things have been a bit off the wall since. Also graduated college in that time and started working, and since then I've even switched careers. I got off of hormonal BC 1 year ago in October of 23. At that point my libido was so low and I did feel heavier than normal, and began feeling more self conscious. After stopping, I noticed my acne coming back and didn't get my period/any bleeding at all for 6 months. That caused me to see a gyno and I was diagnosed with PCOS in May. I was offered to go back on BC and Metformin, but I feel like BC isn't really solving any thing other than the cystic acne, and I have heard of several side effects of Metformin that probably won't help me much. My gyno also recommended Inositol, which I have been taking since May, and honestly I can't really tell if it's been helping or not. As of right now my period is still irregular. Last month I had a perfectly normal period. This month, a day of light bleeding. It really worries me.

I'm so frustrated. Every day I walk at least 10k steps, and I do a 30-45 minute walk after dinner every day. This week since I've been on break from work (I work in the school system), I have been hitting 15k and doing two work outs a day since I have the time. Doing these work outs aren't a way for me to punish myself, I actually have been enjoying them a lot and I really want to be healthier and stronger, and having the time off helps. I also have a 5k I'm training for, my third one in the past four years. The funny thing is I always been very active but it seems like that just doesn't matter at all with my weight and that I always have to eat 1100-1200 calories a day on top of working out excessively and 10k steps. I can do a deficit of 1400 and the steps, and maybe a work out a couple times a week with my current schedule, but I don't have the time anymore to also have hour long workouts everyday, and I don't know if I have it in me to go back down to 1100-1200 cals a day. I want the weight loss so bad. This past week I hit between 12k-15k steps this week plus two work outs a day (jog for 30 min + weight training for 30, min) on a 1400 deficit (minus Christmas day to be fair), and I haven't moved an ounce, which doesn't seem right to me. I'm sure I'm being irrational. But it really pains me to see no movement - if anything the damn scale is showing an increase in 0.4 pounds, which I am trying to tell myself is water weight, but damn!

Overall, I've also always followed a mostly Mediterranean diet aside from having too much sugar, unfortunately. I only drink water and coffee with a tablespoon of almond milk, but I always have a bad sweet tooth and that's my main struggle. I'll eat perfectly for a whole day only to ruin shit when I come home from work or in the evening. I suspect I have an insulin issue because I have always had cravings for sugar, even at my best shape. And on days where I do eat very healthy, I feel so horribly hungry, despite prioritizing protein like fish, beans, and chicken, along with vegetables. I don't eat dairy other than cheese here and there and I try to refrain from carbs. There are days where I eat well and avoid sugar, and I suddenly fall so shaky I could faint. This will happen if I have some fruit in the AM, too, so I avoid sugary breakfasts always. When that happens I have no energy and feel like I can't do much. I'll eat some nuts and the feeling doesn't really go away. Having almond milk sort of helps, but I still feel terrible. I've also tried a bit of fruit juice when my sugar crashes. It helps a tiny bit but I still feel shitty. This shaky feeling has gone on for as long as I can remember, even as a kid and with a normal BMI. I've been trying for months to get an endocrinologist and I am struggling with finding a provider. I was refused an appointment when I told the receptionist I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and was asked by my gyno to reach out to an endocrinologist for further testing. She said ""we don't deal with anything hormone related at all"" and I was so confused... 

Anyways I'm not even expecting anyone to read this all it's more like a vent. It just feels so comical at this point. I guess I need to be patient, strong, and consistent. The time will pass either way. It just maddens me how slow this journey is and I worry about how long it will take for me to get to my goal. It makes me feel like there is something wrong with me. And because of how slow this is, it's almost like I'm waiting to enjoy life. I know it shouldn't be that way. I'm just so frustrated about losing this weight and then having to go through this process all over again, and this time seems 10x harder than last. Vent over, it's a new day and I just need to keep on sticking to it, and hopefully see an endo soon because I'm pretty sure I've got some insulin issues. ",8,1735569999.0,PetiteFitness,0,1.0,False

He also is always offering to help me study or explain anything that I don't understand. He lives in a different city and has told me that he wants to drive me to his city so we could have coffee there. He is also really attentive and noticed that my eyes were watery and asked me if I was okay. He also drove me home once cause I couldn't find any transportation. He initiates convos sometimes but only about uni and he doesn't ask me how I am or what I'm doing unless I ask him first. It's like he's closed off, maybe he's scared because he's from a different city. It's like he's hot and cold, one moment and so closed off the next.

“You looked like you could use the rest,” my husband, Gerald, replied.

“Where are the kids?” I’d just realized that I couldn’t hear them.

“They’re over at the Wilson’s house for the day,” Gerald said, “Think of it as another anniversary present,” he smiled.

“That’s sweet of you,” I walked over and planted a kiss on his forehead, “But you didn’t have to do that. Last night was present enough,” I smiled as thoughts of the previous night flooded my mind.

“So?” he asked, bringing me back to reality.

“So…what?” I wasn’t sure what he was referring to.

“How was it?”

“Do you really want to know?” I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat across the table from him.

“Of course, I do,” he replied, “You’re all anyone is talking about this morning.”

“Really?” I was surprised to hear that, “I didn’t think they’d make the connection that fast.”

“They did,” Gerald lifted the newspaper he was reading and showed me the headline.

SERIAL KILLER RETURNS AFTER 10 YEAR BREAK

“Do they have any leads?” I asked, feeling a little worried that I was rusty and might’ve made a mistake.

“Nope,” he shook his head and smiled, “They are just as baffled now as they were back then.”

“If you really want to know what it’s like, maybe you could come with me next time,” I suggested.

“I can’t hammer a nail without smashing my fingers,” Gerald laughed, “If I tried to kill someone I’d likely just end up stabbing myself. You’re better off working solo.”

“You’re probably right,” I agreed.

As I sat there looking at my husband, I realized just how much he loved me. That prompted me to get up and walk around the table where I grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet.

“What’s this all about?” he asked.

“I haven’t given you your anniversary present yet,” I flashed him a seductive smile as I started leading him to the bedroom.",164,1735569700.0,shortscarystories,4,0.98,False

I color diamonds offer an attractive blend of value and appearance, making them increasingly popular among savvy diamond buyers. Here's what you need to know:

* I color diamonds are 38-39% less expensive than higher color grades (D-F) while still appearing nearly colorless to the naked eye.
* Well-cut I color diamonds, especially round brilliants, can mask their slight yellow tint effectively.
* The trend towards larger, ideally cut diamonds has boosted the appeal of I color stones.
* Blue fluorescence can enhance the white appearance of I color diamonds in certain lighting conditions.
* These diamonds strike a balance between affordability and visual appeal, making them ideal for budget-conscious shoppers seeking larger stones.
* The average price of a 1.00 carat I color diamond is $3,745
* Alternatively, you can get a better looking 2.00 carat lab-grown diamond with D color and VVS2 clarity for $3,060.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Value-oriented buyers looking to maximize size and quality within their budget
* Those comfortable with slight color variations in exchange for better pricing
* Shoppers interested in round brilliant or princess cut engagement rings

# Who is this not for?

* Buyers insisting on completely colorless diamonds
* Those highly sensitive to subtle color differences in diamonds
* Shoppers primarily interested in fancy shape diamonds, which may show more color

# Pros and Cons

Pros:

* Significantly more affordable than higher color grades
* Can appear nearly colorless, especially in ideal cuts
* Allow for larger carat weights within a given budget
* Increasing popularity due to trends in diamond cutting

Cons:

* May exhibit a faint yellow tint, more noticeable in certain settings
* Less suitable for fancy shape diamonds, which tend to show more color
* Not ideal for those extremely sensitive to color nuances

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Prioritize cut quality: A well-cut I color diamond can appear whiter and more brilliant.
2. Consider round brilliant cuts: This shape is most effective at masking slight color.
3. Pair with yellow or rose gold settings to minimize color visibility.

1. Look for medium blue fluorescence, which can enhance the diamond's apparent whiteness.
2. Compare side-by-side with higher and lower color grades to assess visible differences.
3. Consider the size of the diamond - larger stones may show more color.

1. If choosing a fancy shape, you may want to go up a color grade for better visual appeal.

# FAQ

Q: Does an I color diamond look yellow?

A: I color diamonds have a faint yellow tint, but it's often not noticeable to the naked eye, especially in well-cut stones.

Q: How does the setting affect an I color diamond's appearance?

A: Yellow or rose gold settings can help mask the slight color, while white gold or platinum may make it more noticeable.

Q: Are I color diamonds suitable for engagement rings?

A: Yes, they're an excellent choice for those seeking a balance of size, quality, and affordability in an engagement ring.

Q: How does size affect the appearance of color in I diamonds?

A: Larger diamonds tend to show more color, so I color may be more noticeable in stones over 2 carats.

Q: Can fluorescence improve the appearance of an I color diamond?

A: Medium blue fluorescence can make an I color diamond appear whiter, especially in UV-rich lighting conditions.

I do sometimes entertain several story ideas in my mind just for my own amusement. One, for example and to just give you an idea of my goofy ideas, happens in the Matrix reloaded setting between Persephone and Neo and Trinity and Zee and the orgasm cake.

Recently I have been thinking about this cafe called timeout. It's a warm, cozy place, plush with old fashioned furniture, busy and noisy, smell of old wood and good food and beer and wine and coffee (I'm imagining one of Amsterdam's brown cafe's somewhere in de Pijp neighborhood, away from the touristy places). You will find this cafe when you're truly lost and need to feel something new.

It is run by several women (who in my head are based on real world people. I don't have the imagination to just imagine someone out of the thin air and then have an emotional connection with them. My current favorite owner and bartender is Elizabeth Olsen.

You go there to find someone to swap bodies or transform with for 24 hours. The condition is that both of you to fantasize about the same world, same characters and be on the same page about the outcomes.

It can be a swap (man and woman, two women, two men) or a transformations based on mutual interests and desires. It can even happen in other worlds (Cinematic universes \[although I'll ban you from the cafe if you take my Olsen character and mention MCU haha\], literary universes, video games, etc.).

I am thinking of a couple of specific scenarios that I like, but I thought the idea might appeal to other people too. There are so many transformations or other types of swap-based fantasies I don't know about, or am not into that could happen in the cafe. There could be a couple of plush backrooms, a pool room downstairs, all in service of other types of transformations/swaps happening here.

So yeah, just wanted to put it out there in case someone else wants a cozy, warm framework for their fantasies.

My own interest in this scenario still would be swapping bodies with a woman with themes of power shift and alienation and surrender.

I’m in dire need of your opinion on what coffee equipment(s) should I invest in next. 

At present, I just have a Rs. 1700/- worth drip coffee machine from Morphy Richards. I use hot water and remove the carafe to let the coffee bloom for 2 minutes before letting it drip. I use pre-ground coffee. I don’t use filter papers, hence I get a stronger full-bodied coffee which isn’t that bad.

I have a budget of 5-6K which I can invest towards this new hobby of mine. What equipment(s) should I get?

1. Aeropress and Agaro Ceramic Burr Grinder;

2. Timemore C2 and Channi (Tea strainer);

3. Timemore C2 and Hario V60;

4. Budan Mokapot and Timemore C2;

5. Aeropress and just use the pre-ground coffee;
or anything else.

1hpob3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1hpob3a/post_holiday_rant/,Post Holiday Rant,"You can see my history for the background. I am LC with JNMIL and FIL. SIL and DH decided they are ""quiet quitting"". Generally Holidays are completely dumped on me to be the host and do all the stuff. Well SIL really wanted to host this year so she invited us for Christmas day, extended the invitation to her parents and I was pretty elated. JNMIL and FIL joined us for Christmas Eve day, church  and Christmas morning (we have the only kids). JNMIL attempted to tell me what to do and attempted to take control but I didn't allow it. I just did my thing and they came along for the ride. It honestly wasn't bad from my perspective. Between my 2 kids and prepping and cooking 5 meals plus managing to get everyone presentable for Christmas Eve service, I had zero time to be bothered by JN at all. BUT then Christmas day and the day after....holy shitake mushrooms!! I got my dose of complete torture. SIL has a live Christmas tree, I vaguely remember her mentioning this but I forgot my allergy meds. I am SEVERELY allergic to live trees. Christmas meal, etc was great but DH had to leave at 8pm because he started work the next day at 7am and we live an hour away. SIL got us a hotel room 3 minutes from her house so we could stay later but JNMIL insists that we have to go back to the hotel at 8pm too and that she needs me to go too because she doesn't drive well in the dark and wants to follow me. And thus begins my torture of babysitting the JNMIL and FIL until the next day at noon. She spends copious amounts of energy trying to get me to give her my landlord's information because she now wants to livein my apartment community. Nope. Not handing that over. And Guys!!! I have never heard more racist comments in a row, blatant, loud, uncomfortable....OMG! Our rooms were originally comped by the manager, a friend of SIL, who happens to also be black and bilingual. JNMIL proceeded to offend one housekeeper who allegedly didn't speak English (I honestly think she was bilingual) by making rude and inappropriate comments about needing to learn English and Immigrants getting all the FEMA money and other completely racist and misinformed BS. Next morning we are having coffee and JNMIL tries to start a political debate but she is grossly undereducated and instead spouts a series of racist and offensive BS clearly offending several people in the breakfast area. I try to tell her this isn't the space for this conversation but she made me angry and I shut her down and then FIL offered to watch my kid so I could run to get some allergy meds. Great! My face at this point is literally swollen and I was just going to drag them with me but this is better. So I run to the store for about 30 minutes. On my way out I clear the one bag needed for us, it was just one night, and empty my room for the housekeeping, leaving a small tip. I return 30 minutes later which JN insists has been 1 hour, Whatever. JNMIL spends the next 90 minutes packing  their 8 bags. No exaggeration people, 8 bags plus one case of water. Then we check out. We'll my room was comped at check put but they apparently charged JN full price. I didn't say anything but I had my thoughts. Finally we make our way back to SIL so we can meet and go to lunch and finally go home.9n our way inside FIL and JNMIL start a loud conversation again about immigrants because there are about a dozen men outside working on the landscaping, some of whom appear to have Latino decent. OMG!! I am so embarrassed!! Then JNMIL insists on pulling my sweet BIL aside and making him entertain her computer questions for the next 2 hours!!! My 11 year 5 ft 8in son is starving but all he has is Christmas junk food that people gave him to munch on. I am tempted to just leave but my SIL is being cool and playing with my 2 year old daughter so I'm just trying to be chill. Finally we get to the Asian fusion restaurant with an Asian owner who greets my SIL who is her friend and an Asian server both of whom, my in laws make ridiculously racist comments to, thank the Lord for my adorable 2 year old who breaks the ice with her cuteness and captures the managers adoration. This distracts somewhat but JNMIL can't help  but make several comments about my son not eating his meal and my daughter wanting only to dip things in the sauce (she's 2)....then we finally finally get to go home. At this point, my JNMIL asks if I will take the backroads and she will follow because again she has no clue I guess how to get back home. Well I pull this up on my phone and it is 1 hour 36 minutes via the back route and 43 minutes via the hwy. Sorry inlaws, I just pulled right on the interstate and they were forced to follow. Ugh!! I was so overwhelmed by the racist BS and the political proselytizing that I just wanted to scream! My 11 yo is asking me dozens of questions about things they said on the way home and I'm trying not to paint his grandparents as racist jerks but it's hard. And now I don't have to see or talk to them until the next holiday. Phew!! I just needed to rant but seriously next time I told DH I am absolutely not going to be the in law babysitter. 🙃 ",27,1735568743.0,JUSTNOMIL,4,0.94,False

","My opinion on Nukumizu
Many people say that Nukumizu is a slowpoke who doesn't understand hints. But in fact, he understands many hints but ignores them or pretends to be a fool. I read on Reddit that you can't always trust his story, I agree with that. Sometimes his actions strongly contradict his internal monologues. But this does not cancel out his kindness and empathy, many Redditors will say that this is not so and I will understand why they think so. Nukumizu at first glance seems to be a very cold and straight as a rail person, but in fact he is quite a soft and kind, mature person. But Yanami, Lemon, Komari will tell me that he is an idiot, but it seems to me that they also do not always tell the truth (especially about Nukumizu). You will say that this is not so, in their stories for the club magazine, Yanami and Komari are described as a kind and attentive boy and this will be true. I'll give an example in Yanami's story, Ako-san says in her monologue that XX-kun is such a jerk, but in fact they almost always have an ordinary dialogue and XX-kun even treats her to her favorite coffee that she always takes. Where is Nukumizu a jerk here? Nowhere, He has never been one. Even in Komari's story, Nukumizu is the duke who helped her and he is always kind to her. If he really was such a jerk, then the heroines would almost never contact him. But in fact, whose words we can believe are Koto, Shintaro, Shikiya, Hokobaru, Tiara, Asagumo, Sousuke, Ayano. They speak very positively about Nukumizu, you will say that Yanami, Lemon, Komari spend more time with him, but they are very biased to be honest and they are often wrong.I admit that Nukumizu sometimes behaves stupidly, but overall this is my view on this character.

Hi everyone, I am new to this forum but I have been a fan of Wonyoungism and Wonyoung for a couple years now. 

2025 is starting soon, and so is my new weight loss journey! Please follow along for my gentle weight loss plan and method. 

I want to preface this by saying that health is always THE most important when it comes to weightloss, and I have always aimed to lose weight in a gentle way to maintain my good health and body shape. Additionally, I recently turned 23 and I want to make very clear that if you are under the age of 18 or have a negative body image, do not think about losing weight. You need to continue growing up and/or work on your mindset and mental health first. Understanding yourself and respecting yourself are the first steps of health and beauty. 



🌷🌷🌷



**My Journey so far**

So, I am 168cm and this was my progress during 2024:

72kg 1st May 2024  
71kg 13rd May 2024  
70kg 25th May 2024  
69kg 29th June 2024  
68kg 13th July 2024  
67kg 23rd July 2024  
66kg 7th August 2024  
65kg 31st August 2024  
64kg 9th October 2024  
63kg 16th December 2024

I usually weigh myself about twice a week and record the weights in the app happy scale. I also take pictures because the photos really show a lot. May - September was definitely my faster weigh tloss and September - December I wasn't focused or trying very hard, which is why my progress was a lot slower. 

This morning I weighed myself and I was 63.6kg so this is the weight I will be starting 2025 with. 



🌷🌷🌷



**My method**

Firstly I want to say that the most effective way to lose weight is to be healthy, gentle and consistent. It is very important that you find the right balance for yourself. With that being said, these are the rules I followed between May to September 2024 

1. Fast between 8pm to lunchtime the next day for four days a week. On the days I ate breakfast it   would be a boiled egg. 
2. Walk at 8,000 steps per day. More is better and during this time I averaged 9k steps
3. For lunch I would always eat a high fat, high carb very filling large meal. My go to was 1 avocado, small bowl of jasmine rice, tomatoes, salmon with butter, 2 figs, handful of blueberries, cheese, walnuts, pecans, seaweed, baby spinach leaves. Sometimes I would also eat a pot of cottage cheese and yoghurt. For me the point of this meal is to get a lot of nutrients and really satisfy myself. I've read before that processed foods don't make us feel as full and interfere with our biological processes.
4. For me dinner varies a lot depending on how hungry I am. Some days I will eat simple salad and some fruit for dinner, on other days dumplings, steak.
5. The only rule I followed strictly was not eating and sugary and processed foods out of mealtimes. For example, if I have a really strong desire for chocolate I will put the chocolate I want to eat in a bowl and save it for my next lunchtime, and eat it after. However I would allow myself to snack on apples, nuts, cottage cheese whenever I felt like it, just not after 8pm. 
6. Finally I drink alcohol very rarely. One cocktail a month? That is probably how much alcohol I drink. I also drank zero fizzy drinks during this time. Maybe a glass of fresh orange juice or matcha latte once a week, other than that I only drink water, lemon water and green tea. 
7. Lazy girl mat workouts 2 evenings per week. I can explain more about these next time but really just very chill lazy workout I can do whilst watching tv 😛

Of course, as I mentioned before, I only lost 2kg between September and December and that is because I didn't stick to my plan as much. I would say during these four months I only stuck to my plan 50%, so it's a miracle I lost weight at all 😂. I completely stopped my morning walks and only averaged 5000 steps and then I also didn't fast at all, I would snack sometimes at 1am 💀 oops. I also ate ALOT of chocolate which is my weakness. So from all this I can gather my main issue is consistency. 



🌷🌷🌷



**2025 Goals and plans**

My final weight loss goal is about 54kg-50kg, this is the range I would like to achieve. I have roughly 9.6kg-13.6kg left to lose in 2024. 

My goal is to lose 2kgs per month:  
January 62kg  
February 60kg  
March 58kg  
April 56kg  
May 54kg (continue or not?)  
June 52kg  
July 50kg

New year new meeee! It's time to get healthier! New plan:

Activity: 

1. 10,000 steps per day (6 days a week)
2. Lazy girl mat workout 3 evenings per week 

Diet: 

1. Tea, water, coffee is fine (no alcohol, fizzy or processed drinks)
2. Fast between 8pm - 12 next day)
3. Eat big lunch (as mentioned before) and small dinner. 
4. No sweet treats outside of mealtimes. 
5. Snacking on fruit and nuts is fine. 
6. BE CONSISTENT - My goal is to follow these rules 90%.

\-Pete- I think it would be sweet to get him something donut and coffee scented!

\-Isaac- I think he would appreciate a good ""theme"" candle...maybe find him a candle that evokes a vintage library, a designer's office, a museum with Dinos, etc.

\-Trevor- I get the sense Trevor would be secretly into hygiene/cleanliness so maybe something clean cut like ""pure"" or linen scented?

\-Nancy- I could see Nancy getting on the fun/themed candle train...guac scented?

1hpo516,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hpo516/2_years_since_breakup/,+2 years since breakup,"Dear all, 

It is the first time I post something like this online. Until now I have been sharing it with friends/family/therapist but and tbh I don't really know why I am doing this. 

Right now I am a 26M, and since my ex broke up with me it has been more than 2 years. We were both 22 when we got into the relationship and it lasted 2 years. It was my first real relationship and I was fully in love. The break-up came out of nowhere for me. It was just 6 days after we celebrated her birthday and was also getting ready to get her all kind of Christmas gift. 

I don't know where I wanna get to with this so sorry for being so messy. 

When we got together I always had a small part of me who knew it might not last forever. I have been moving left and right, I have family everywhere around the world, I don't really have a solid ground to call ""home"". Whenever people ask me this question, my answer to ""home"" is a place with a roof and a bed. 

Her was the opposite, all her family was from the same country, she lived in the same two place all her life, her studies and later on job didn't really allowed her a lot of movement. She always wanted to plan ahead the future because of this. Where we going to be in 1,3,6, 12 months, while for me I lived life 1 day at a time since I know how easily everything can just change even with the best of planning. 

So, there was a bit of difference in regard of this. Additionally, at the beginning we both were against having children and agreed how lucky we are that we both have our own place and we don't ""need"" to move in together for financial reason instead we can just spend as much time as we want at once place and then the other. IF we wanted some alone time we always had that luxury to just go to ""our"" own home. 

However, things changed on her side. I remember how, one time when we were just enjoying some coffee and talking about everything and nothing she brought up if I am still against the idea of having kids. It caught me of surprise but I told her how I don't want kids. Then she asked about moving in together to which I brought up why not but to whom apartment. Both of us had some good arguments which should move to which but we came back to the conclusion that we are happy as we are. (this conversation happened around 2-3 months before the breakup)

Things went on as usual, happy, carefree, even agreed to continue our relationship long-distance when I go to do my master degree in another country. We celebrated her birthday with her family, I remember I was so excited as I have been preparing for months with all the gifts and I was so happy to see her overjoyed. Then around a few days after that while she was at my place and was studying and me working in the middle of the day she asked again about the kid question. To which I said no and she started to cry. I remember embracing her because she was crying but not really understanding why and what was going on. After she calmed down she asked me to give her key back and she gave my key back. To which I was still blind about what was going to happen.

A few days later the breakup happened. I called her up in the middle of the day to tell her about a funny story to which after she told me she wanted to breakup. I asked her several times if she is sure and if there is nothing I/we can do to avoid this. To which she said no. After hanging up the phone I went to my friend place and cried as hard as when my grandpa passed away. 

I was ""lucky"" as after that I had to travel because of work and I was doing 10-12 hours shifts to try to forget about real life. I told the lie to all my colleagues and family that this was the best option. Her future was in that country and my future who knows where etc bullshit. After 2 weeks, I was back in the country and texted her to see her to give back each other our stuff. I of course brought her family gifts from my travel and then we had a 2-3 hours long talk because of course I had a lot of questions. Why? What? How? etc etc. 

She told me how she was so excited about her/our future and that she had everything planned out but that I need to figure out on my own what I want. The thing is the future she had planned out and told me about for the first time was beautiful and something I would have loved to. When I told her let's do it and that I love her plan she said that no because that is her plan and not mine, to which I argued that well it our because we need the both side for it. She also gaslighted me a bit with saying that if I truly loved her I would have came back from my work travel and tried to get us back together. The problem is that I loved her so much that when she broke up with me and I asked her if she is sure, I decided to respect her wish and not make it harder no matter how much it hurt or it was painful. Of course if I knew she wanted this I would have done anything and everything to get her back. We decided to talk again in 2 weeks after her exam. During this time I would leave her care packages and flowers in front her place. The 2 weeks came by and when we met again my goal was to get her back. Make all the necessary ""sacrifices"", by then I started to speak to a therapist to figure out what I want, move in together, being open to have kid(s) but of course only later on the line etc etc. However, she had other plan and as soon we sat down to talk she started by saying that she just wanted us to be friends. I still told her everything I had written down and was willing to do for us. We only had 1 hour to talk and couldn't really finish our convo but she was not willing to consider my proposals. I asked her to give me some space and to have communication silence. It lasted 15 days in which I wanted to talk to her because I felt like she has been putting everything on me as being the fault why it didn't work. 

So we met again, this time we talked for 2-2 and a half hours, I told her stuff that bothered me with her friend group, with things that happened in the summer between her family and mine (nothing big but it still bothered me). She rebutted me saying how angry she was that this relationship didn't work because whenever she puts herself to something she always see it through and even cried towards to end. I felt horrible for putting her in that condition so after going home and also crying and good session I went to buy a Christmas tree and went to her to beg her one last time to get back together. She really liked this move and we genuinely had a nice convo but she asked me to give her a week to think it over and asked me to respect her decision whatever it might be. Unfortunately for me it was a no. 

The period after it was horrible. Sleepless nights, a lot of crying, some dark ideas. All this didn't help that I wanted to keep some kind of communication with her because naively I was hoping that we could become some kind of friends later on the line (it was her wish after the breakup to stay in contact). Unfortunately it was toxic and bad. She said she only wants to text once a month, which is just stupid it's not something you do with people. She was back on tinder 3-4 months after the breakup (she told me that she went on a date with an old classmate of mine but in the defense of the guy he didn't know she was my ex). 2 months after that she told me she was seeing someone that was making her happy. 

Since then we don't text. I moved to another country to do my master degree, got a job in that country and I am genuinely grateful for life. However dating has been crap since then, I am afraid to open up, to share things of me because ""what's the point if she will just leave me"". I do try, I have seen a few girls for short periods left and right but the fire I had back then is nowhere to be found. My therapist told me that I will never found what I had because that is in the past. That was with her and with someone else it will be different. But, I feel like more and more that I will not find anything, I am slowly convincing myself that I am better just alone and live life like that. I don't know, by this point I think I have been through my 30th session, I always tell myself things will get better and they do get better, nice job, nice city, nice friends, family also getting better but then I just remember her and it's as if nothing mattered what I achieved. I check her facebook, I check her insta, why? I don't know... Do I wish we were in contact? Maybe? Even tho I know it wouldn't be healthy for me but is this healthy? Not at all... I really hope I am wrong but it has been now more than 2 years and I am scared that I will never be able to love someone like I loved her back then. 

Again, thank you for getting this far, if you had similar story and have an idea if it will get easier I am open to anything. ",1,1735568245.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

So, I need to get this off my chest because I feel stuck and don’t know what to do.

A couple of years ago, during my second year of college, I met this amazing woman at a coffee shop. Let’s call her Sarah. We instantly clicked. Like, I’ve never connected with someone so quickly before. She was funny, smart, kind, and became my best friend. I cared about her deeply, almost like I loved her in a way, but not romantically.

At the same time, I had this massive crush on one of the college counselors. Let’s call him Dr. X. He was everything—charming, brilliant, and honestly, I was obsessed. I would go to his office under the pretext of needing guidance, but I found myself just staring at him, trying to keep it together. I followed him on social media, stalked his posts, and just… couldn’t stop thinking about him. But I never told Sarah about him. It just didn’t seem relevant, and I didn’t want her to think I was weird.

Two months into our friendship, I found out something that completely floored me: Dr. X was her fiancé. I had no idea until then because Sarah never talked about him like he was her fiancé. She mentioned him casually, like he was just someone she knew. I eventually realized it was because their relationship wasn’t solid—they didn’t really love each other, and it was clear things were rocky between them.

When I found out, I decided to bury my feelings for him. I told myself that he wasn’t just some attractive counselor anymore; he was Sarah’s fiancé. I wanted to respect that.

Despite that, Sarah and I got even closer. We had some of the best times together—late-night talks, sharing secrets, going on little adventures. She trusted me, and I trusted her. I thought this was how things were going to be forever.

But then, everything changed. Sarah and Dr. X broke up. It was bad—like, no-going-back bad. They had a huge fight, and that was it. They called off the wedding, and Sarah was devastated. I did everything I could to support her because she meant so much to me.

Sarah now hates her ex and blames him for their whole relationship. But from what she’s told me, they just weren’t a good match. They stayed together because they were available and felt stuck. She admits she was never in love with him, but stayed because he was there.
Here’s the thing, though: I still have feelings for him. Even after everything, I’m still so into him. I started talking to him a bit—just casual texts at first—but then he started asking me personal questions, trying to get to know me. It felt… nice. Like maybe there could be something there.

But when Sarah found out, she wasn’t okay with it. She didn’t yell or anything, but she was hurt, and I could tell. So, I told her I’d block him, and I did. I reassured her that nothing was going on and that I was just being friendly. I didn’t want to lose her, and honestly, I still don’t. She’s one of the most important people in my life.

The problem is, I can’t stop thinking about him. I regret blocking him. I feel like I betrayed myself, but I also feel like I owe it to Sarah to stay away from him. I still care about her so much, but I’m still obsessed with him.

Of course! Here are the last two paragraphs separately:


---

The thing is, even though I blocked him, I can’t stop thinking about him. I even started going to the coffee shop where he always gets his coffee, hoping to see him. One time, when we were hanging out, Sarah jokingly said that Dr. X and I would make a great couple. I laughed it off, but it stuck with me.
i feel Like i am terrible friend and terrible person 



I don’t know what to do. Do I risk my friendship for a chance with him? Or do I let this go and focus on Sarah? Am I a terrible person for even feeling this way?

1hpo25u,https://www.reddit.com/r/hoi4/comments/1hpo25u/i_finally_did_it_i_achieved_brazil_wc_here_were/,"I finally did it, i achieved Brazil WC, here were the broad strokes","So the other day i completed the Bad Ending - the whole world is brazil achievement and it was a ride and a half. Took about 6 tries and by the 5th try i figured it all out. The TL;DR was simple:

Go monarchists to control Portugal as a puppet, build cracked mountaineers, take over all of south America until Panama with mountaineers and the portugese army. Afterwards conquer central america until i run into allies and join axis, steam roll America with grinded generals and mountaineers, knock UK and control everything west of the Atlantic. turn Portugal into a fortress and make cracked infantry/motorized holding division with top teir air support. Grind the axis down in spain and take europe then steam roll Japan. For the Love and war version see below.

  
Chapter 1 South American Empire

Went monarchists and decided that airplanes and tanks would not win it for me, i need mountaineers. So i got 25 width moutnaineers and i was able t ostart with about 4 of them with rangers, engineers and artillery attached. using them i started on Paraguay and bolivia. Paraguay goes into puppet for me and bolivia goes down quick. I then pick a fight with Uruguay and roll them which causes Argentina to roll up on me. in all my past runs the Argie war took way too long, but the mountaineers cut through to the supply depots like a knife through butter. then moved to chile and the rest of South America. The whole time i avoided joining the axis until after i hit Panama. 

The entire time i was building civilians factories until about early 1938, but i picked a special project to work on, railways and ports. it is imperative that as Brazil you build a supply network through the amazons and around the coast. Moving divisions and supply through SA is ASS, and the networks developed made deployments and movements easy as pie.

During this time i spent a good bit developing the best '36 fighter i could and that little guy pretty much won the air war for me..... because i forgot to use the '40s aircraft after i researched it. in addition I built a Naval, air and nuclear research facility....... these would all prove useful later

Chapter 2 WW2

So once i jumped through central America that was it, allies declared on me and i threw in with the Axis powers, much to my disgust. either way i worked up central America with minimal resistance and my superb fighters and early tactical bomber fleet. once i hit Mexico though it was go time and i slowly worked my way through supply hubs until bam, Mexico was capped with an armies worth of US divisions trapped. I made short work of them and moved through texas waiting a bit and licking my wounds. 

By this time the Army was about a million strong and i had a complete contingent of mountaineer divisions that went to work taking the West coast. After some grinding i capped the US and by this time one of my wonder weapons was about ready to be deployed cruiser subs, soon to be followed by fleet sub marines. after some waiting, building and Canada got racked up a an after thought.

  
Last that stood was the UK. the soviets got capped by germany and it was my job to get the brits under my boot. at this point  iwas pumping out fleet subs and decent naval strikers and took control off the sea. After that a mass landing of around 4 full armies of marines poured into britannia and that was it. mid 1940s the free world went cold.

Chapter 3 the Calm

With the victory i began setting up for the confrontation in portugal. They were annexed, radars, airfields, ports supply hubs were built.

Units were maximized to deal with all threats and fortress Portugal was established. The one thorn in my side was England. 

In the peace deal i took the Americas, and only soutehrn England. the dirty germans had taken the north and scotland. To this end i deployed my beautiful new tanks, backed my marines and a token airforce contingent we had to secure the Island. As I waited i made another play to join the japanese faction, but to no avail.

During this time i was able to finalize the production of some wodner weapons. I had developed around 20 nukes, i ahd motherships, and a stategtic bomber to level cities and carry out nuclear strikes. I was prepped for the best and worst scenario. something that would come in handy much later. 

The only thing left to do was break away and start my war goal.... little did i know german had me beat to the punch.

Chapter 4 the good times

The war kicked off and my fleet of subs was able to dominate the seas allowing for the marines and tanks to seize the british isles. In protugal the Axis was stacking along the border and running into the wall of bullets i had set up. Things were looking good, but the Axis had a moutain of equipment and planes to call on so i knew thinning them out would take some time.

During this waiting time i had setup specific convoy routes and was looking to just make some coffee and relax. I had made a handful of naval invasions in northern Spain to attempt a northern encirclement and was finding a level of success. little did i know disaster was on the horizon.....

Chapter 5 disaster

IDK what happened but i was looking at portugal and seeing attrittion blips start to appear. confused i looked and had about 3k convoys at my disposal. It then dawned on me that the Germans had built a formidable sub force and were raiding a single tile destroying my supply. even with 300 ships along the convoy route i was unable t odetect them or counter them. 

I immediately worked on counter measures, but the first domino began to fall. In Portugal I began losing tiles slowly, then quickly, and within a month i was being pushed into the sea. A general rettreat was called and of the 8 full armies present in portugal non escpaed without losses and in total 1 million were captured or killed. a stunning defeat. 

In my drunken frustration i used my subs to hold England and began what can only be called a Nuclear culling of Europe. at the end of the retreat i had about 34 nukes available, following the red butto smash i had dropped close to 10 nukes over Europe while i prepared for my return

Chapter 6 Licking the wounds

Beaten but not defeated i rebuilt reloaded my game and found my supply issue was magically fixed. Convoy efficiency at 95 percent now to England and with new heavy naval  bombers i was able to destroy the Kreigsmarine. 

I also revamped the marine Corps and created nearly 1000 brigades worth of marine units to retake first portugal, then Europe. I also noticed my airforce was in shambles. The mother ships, while doing amazing damage felt losses much more then the germans. To that end i refocused on elite fighters models and delegted motherships to assisting withlong range bomber missions. I was rebuilding my forces and by the early 1950's was ready for round 2

Chapter 7 the return and collapse

After a complete naval invasion comprising of some 100 plus marine divisions I was able to retake portugal and even southern spain, just at the edge of the Rock. My standing army then moved in to hold the gains while my marines prepped further invasions of northern Spain and northern Africa. with control of my massive Portuguese airfields and maxed radars my small fighters were able to whittle down the german air force from a near 25k fighters to just 600 by wars end. 

The naval invasions popped off and i was able to encircle nearly 100+ divisions in northern Spain, then another pocket in southern spain and then i had  a devious plan. Spain was on the brink of collapse, 95 percent to Capping. So i planned a massive invasion force of nearly all my marines to pinch the axis forces at the Pyrenees mountains. To my shock it worked. the marines landed, capped spain and i was able to move the marines in the hold the frontline in france while my standing army made a mad dash to crush the trapped axis forces. at the end of it all the axis forces were down millions of men across the board and i reconsolidated my forces for the final push. In the following order after spain i knocked out Italy (second largest Axis army, the france, Norway and sweden and then the final domino.

The invasion of germany was mean to be a grand affair. I used the maximum number of divisions for the invasion i was permitted to use and in one fell swoop took the entire german coastline and cities. I advanced on the token units left to defend the area and then saw a complete collapse of their military. WE walked into Berlin.

then like a spit in the mouth some how Bulgaria become a major faction member so we rode down there, spanked them and took the Axis for ourselves.

Chapter 8 Japan

It was a joke, they were producing only 26 units of oil at the start of our war because i had established myself in the area during the war with the allies so they had no oil, minimal rubber and no chance. Did you know if you own Siberia you can pull back to almost the Urals and watch the Japanese Army attrition itself to death in the wintery hellscape? well they will and i did abuse this to my benefit. to my count nearly a quarter of the Japanese Army was in Siberia dying of hypothermia.

A quick invasion of all of asian occurred and then a massive naval invasion of the home islands resulted in my final peace conference and a world that only knew Brazil.

  
In the end this was a super fun achievement and I would recommend everyone try it out. The ups and downs, the loss and return to Europe, Fleet subs being busted and turning Europe into a nuclear hellhole was amazing. Going to try more south American countries now, but for now gonna take a break and play EU4",1,1735568006.0,hoi4,0,0.67,False

Find your niche from either professional experience or a side hobby you’ve been into for years. The other option is to take viewers on a learning journey with you as you take up something new, but this may be better as a vlog-style series.

# Outline your first 4 Pillar episodes

The goal of the first 10 episodes is to reach as many people as possible and hook them into subscribing. For a few, that may happen on episode 1, but chances are many more won’t find your show until episode 3, 8 — or even 30. 

So the point of Pillar episodes is to always have a roadmap for your new listeners to follow.

Take your chosen niche and break it down into 4 broad, timeless categories. These are the discussions that always pop up, the questions newbies always ask, your high-level ideas/frameworks/opinions that you bring to your topic. 

If you're new, these Pillar episodes are not going to be your best, most amazing shows because you’re new and your skills will improve over time.

They exist to give your future shows and listeners a clear anchor point — a short series to clearly understand your premise.

# Connect with your audience with 4 stories

Pair each Pillar with a story. Even in the age of AI, we’re still very socially wired as humans. Your audience will want to know **how** and **why** you came to these ideas. 

If you’re co-hosting, one of you can take the role of interviewer in these episodes. If you’re doing 1-on-1 guest interviews, try to line up guests that match each pillar thesis. 

These should be formative stories in your life, ones you’ve told many times over coffee or beer. You want to be comfortable with the content and smooth with delivery. Just like the story in Reservoir Dogs, you’re building rapport here with people (new listeners) who don’t quite know if they should trust you. 

Then the logical path is always back to your Pillar episode. So if you hook someone on story 3, they go back to Pillar 3 and then they want to know all your Pillar ideas, binge all your shows and become a happy subscriber ever after!

By the time you finish the 4th story, you’ll have 8 episodes published and you should be getting feedback on the show. If you make it that far, you’ve already beat the \~47% of podcasts that [never published more than 3 episodes](https://www.amplifimedia.com/blogstein-1/lyspqop3ylro9a2t7y2de820uwkgwx).

# Keep momentum with your next 12 episodes

You now have your binge bank published — those four Pillar episodes and stories that you should refer to regularly as you move into your ‘regular’ show cadence. 

Use these first 20 shows to get into a rhythm.

If you started out thinking you could push out 1 show per week but realize by episode 12 that you’re totally stressed out — dial it back. Growing your audience is not just about putting out new episodes, but also marketing the ones you’ve already published.

This plan is simple because getting to episode ten with a new show is not easy. There are a lot of little tasks that you won’t see if you’ve never launched a show before.

Get your workflow and tools dialed for:

* thumbnails
* writing descriptions
* publishing [short clips](https://clipwing.pro/blog/post/5-strategies-to-make-more-engaging-reels-shorts-or-tiktoks) on social media
* handling remote recordings, etc etc.

The more of these processes you get dialed in ahead of the launch, the faster you’ll be able to put things on autopilot so that the show production itself takes less time and mental energy. 

You want to put all that towards the content, building a guest network, engaging with the audience — the fun stuff!",1,1735567982.0,NewTubers,0,1.0,False
