1l6iubz,https://i.redd.it/bs7ch8glvq5f1.jpeg,Everyone is excited about it but no one is buying tickets,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short but I decided to put together a Romantasy ball for my town (large but not metro city). 

I have a degree in Hospitality management with certifications in Event management and I have decades of experience as a professional cook, bartender, event worker and currently work as a wine rep.

I‚Äôve got a gorgeous venue tentatively booked, a string quartet booked, local book stores sponsoring and donating items including autographed books, a few local authors coming to sign, a mobile coffee bar, signature craft cocktails, complementary tarot card reader, fairy hair artist, a forever jewelry booth (not included in ticket price), looking to add a complementary henna artist, a free raffle for all attendees, just announced sponsorship of a local distillery which is also donating a private tour for the raffle. I‚Äôve created an instagram account for the event with about 200 followers and posted about the catering having vegan and gf options. Every time we have an update- like a local wine shop donated these cool Moon Magic ‚Äújust add liqour‚Äù cocktail kits to the raffle prizes- I do a post to keep people updated and excited.

Tickets are $150 each, $180 for VIP 

Everyone I talk to about it is so excited- even when I met with the distillery owner at a local small bookstore, women who overheard us jumped in about how they would love to go. I gave them a flyer, which I‚Äôve also been leaving covertly in the romance sections of books a million etc around town, local bookstores have the flyers etc. I‚Äôm still working on spreading the flyers. I‚Äôve joined a bunch of local women‚Äôs groups on Facebook for various book clubs and women‚Äôs activity groups.

The issue is, everyone is excited and says they are so happy ‚Äúsomeone is finally doing one here‚Äù BUT NO ONE IS BUYING TICKETS!

Since starting the Instagram about a month ago, we have sold a grand total of TWO TICKETS.

I‚Äôm getting frustrated because I feel like I‚Äôm putting a lot of time and effort into organizing a great event, spending my time and money to promote it and get it shaped up to be a great event and I don‚Äôt even know if we‚Äôre going to be able to *have* it because a lack of ticket sales.

The event is in early August so there‚Äôs still time but at a certain point I‚Äôve got to call it. I need the money from ticket sales to be able to pay vendor deposits and start paying for things. At this point I feel like I want to give up because everyone keeps saying they are excited and want to go, but no one is actually buying tickets‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. üò≠

I've purchased the concentrate from Republic of Tea--the actual brand of chai concentrate that Panera uses--before (note that the big jug they sell is the correct taste; the little bottle is far from it), but with a one-month or whatever expiration time and not much room for a big jug of tea concentrate to sit in my tiny fridge (it actually leaked through the cap when I sat it on its side on a shelf as a space compromise), it's just much easier for me to deal with teabags.

The way I do it is by steeping one teabag of RoT's Bold Black Chai (same flavor/balance of spices as the concentrate) for 5 minutes in 40 mL of boiled water in a double-walled glass. While that's happening, I steam 150 mL of milk with my Creatista and then add that and 1 tbsp of granulated sugar to the glass (minus the teabag). This comes to about 6 or so total ounces of chai tea latte, depending on your milk's fat content and your machine's settings for milk steaming. The flavor is just right and so delicious. If you'd like more than this amount, just adjust ratios (1 tbsp sugar: 1 tea bag: 40 mL water: 150 mL milk) accordingly.

1l6ipc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetoxMethods/comments/1l6ipc9/my_fast_detox_journey_seeking_reassurance/,My Fast & Detox Journey (seeking reassurance),"Peace everyone. ü©µ

I‚Äôve always been intentional about the words I speak over my life and body, so while I don‚Äôt (and never will) claim the big C or any other serious illness, I am preparing for a deep cleanse/detox and open to insight from anyone who‚Äôs gone through something similar.

I‚Äôve practiced intermittent fasting for a while now, but I‚Äôll be starting my 7 day water fast on June 10th, aligning with the moon cycle for a deeper spiritual and physical reset. I plan to follow that with 7 day raw fruit juice cleanse (sourced as clean from local Amish communities). During or after that, I plan to begin incorporating Ivermectin and Fenbendazole into my detox journey.

My appetite has been almost nonexistent this past month, and that‚Äôs my only worry because I‚Äôve already lost more weight than I‚Äôd like. That said, I‚Äôm pretty solid when it comes to mind over matter, so I‚Äôm confident I can push through the first few days. I‚Äôm really hoping that by day 3, once my body enters ketosis, my energy levels start to rise again, like many people experience. ü§ûüèΩ


My key notes & reminders to self: 

Fasting Timeline:
Days 1 through 7: Water only (Mountain Valley or other mineral rich in glass bottle). Document daily journey with educational and personal experiences.

Days 8 through 14: Raw juice only, focusing on hydrating, low-glycemic fruits and vegetables (no store bought, only fresh-pressed from Amish farm). Document daily journey with educational and personal experiences.

Detox Timeline:
After or during juice fast: Introduce Ivermectin and Fenbendazole cautiously based on body cues and timing. Document daily journey with educational and personal experience, while also detailing how I got here (life story).

Stages of the Water Fast
Day 1 to 2: Glycogen depletion. I may feel fatigued or experience detox symptoms

Day 3 to 4: Ketosis begins as the body starts burning fat for energy. Mental clarity may increase

Day 5 to 7: Deep autophagy begins. Cellular repair, immune support, and emotional detox may follow
Breaking the Water Fast (Gently)

Best practice: Break the fast with small amounts of juicy, hydrating fruits like watermelon or citrus. Space these out over several hours

Avoid fats, heavy fibers, and starches for at least the first 24 to 48 hours (I‚Äôve heard contradicting opinions on whether fats are needed or to be avoided)

Herbal teas or diluted juices can help ease digestion if needed, but be mindful of which herbs, as some dehydrate you, and some (like dandelion or nettle) can support detox, but skip these during the first few days to keep the fast strict.

Supplements and Support
Celtic salt or sole water for trace minerals, if dizziness or weakness occurs (use extremely sparingly)

Activated charcoal or bentonite clay may help during parasite detox, if I choose to use a binder and include them

Mind and Environment
NO COFFEE üò´ cut the whole ‚Äúmorning routine‚Äù & wing it.. It‚Äôs summer ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Possibly taking a social media fast at the end for added clarity

Prioritizing rest, sunshine, prayer, walks (if possible), and daily documenting/journaling.

Most importantly, honoring my intuition over any rules. If my body signals it needs support, I‚Äôll listen to avoid a hospital trip. 


Questions: 
1. What brand of water do you prefer to drink during a fast? I‚Äôm starting with Mountain Valley in glass bottles, but I‚Äôm curious to learn what others use
2. What has worked best for you when breaking your fast safely?
3. Has anyone had a bad body response when they combined Ivermectin and Fenbendazole with fasting? (I plan to save them both for after the end of my 2 week fasting period)
4. I plan to mostly use watermelon for my juice cleanse, but do you recommend any other? & how do you feel about using vegetable juice instead to avoid the sugar content?
5. Does anyone have a legit source to authentic soursop? (I do NOT trust the ‚Äúbitters‚Äù sold on Amazon/Tiktok). 
6. I do not plan to use a binder, but if I did, which one would you suggest?
Do you recommend adding any vegetables? Or have any fruits that I should stay away from?
7. Anyone ever detoxed from heavy metals, and can offer guidances about that (I will also search the group a later date).

You know that feeling... you‚Äôve worked toward something for years. And when you finally reached it, can't even share it at the coffee corner at work since they won't have any clue what you're on about. So i wanted to share this here... if you guys dont mind <3  
  
Weeks of training before an official event. Testing cars and setups. Official event after official event. Hoping to win it... but somehow it never panned out. Sometimes it was just bad luck, hardware failure, connection loss, sleep deprivation, or the coin simply not flipping our way... almost giving up hope.

We were never a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù team, fun was always the main reason we did these events. But finally, after years of trying, I‚Äôm proud to say that my two good iRacing friends and I *finally* won an official 24-hour race.

And not just any race, it was the Nordschleife, by far the most challenging endurance race for us. We won with an incredible 4 minute and 50 second lead over P2, with only 19 seconds of optional repairs in the full 24 hours.

I want to thank all the participants of the Saturday (7th june morning time slot) SPLIT 6: GT3s as well as GT4s. You all drove like true gentlemen racers. Fought for track position where you could, yielded when it was smart, and it was an absolute blast. You‚Äôre all legends and part of this story. So from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. 

Hope to see you all in the next one!

I‚Äôm not sure of his exact age but I think early 30s (though he looks a little older, like 36-38.). He‚Äôs very charismatic, handsome, fit, charming, the works. He‚Äôs hands in his training by nature plus he‚Äôs from a Latin American country so there is definitely a fun and flirty vibe to his sessions. A deadly combo.

I am not delusional and I know a huge part of his job is to make me feel good so I will come back. But I can‚Äôt help feeling things have evolved the past few weeks, and there is a mutual attraction going on. I don‚Äôt want to embarrass myself hence why I‚Äôm posting on a men‚Äôs subreddit! Does he like me or is just trying to keep me as a client? Haha.

A few things to note:

* There is a language barrier. He doesn‚Äôt speak English, only Spanish. I speak broken Spanish and understand probably half of what he says.
* We‚Äôre both outgoing, friendly people so our sessions have an easy energy to them.
* He‚Äôs hands on in his training. But the past few weeks he‚Äôs been especially affectionate with me. He put his hand on my lower back when it wasn‚Äôt necessary, he puts his arm around me, he‚Äôs laid his head on my shoulder and back. Since it‚Äôs a training gym I don‚Äôt see him with other clients, so I don‚Äôt know if he is doing this with anyone else. But I definitely feel a spark between us.
* He‚Äôs told me on several occasions that my body is looking good.
* He always likes my Instagram stories when I post workout pics (like once a week or so).
* I know he‚Äôs single and he‚Äôs told me he wants to be in a relationship.
* I caught him filming me from behind when I was on a machine. He told me it was for my form and he‚Äôd send it later. He never sent it. I wasn‚Äôt bothered, because at this point I sensed there was an attraction and I was into it.
* At our last session I told him my sessions with him were my favorite part of the week, and he suggested we get a coffee sometime.

These are the things that make me think there is a mutual attraction, but then there have been other things that hold me back:

* He checks his phone during our sessions. Not always and not SUPER frequently, but on enough occasions that I notice.
* I once tried to set up a session outside the studio and he never got back to me about scheduling.
* A few weeks ago he mentioned my friend was pretty (from an Insta story).
* While we sometimes have a light flirty banter on Insta, all of our text messages are about scheduling. I make sure to respect his personal time and don‚Äôt message him unless it‚Äôs business related.

I‚Äôm avoidant by nature but I‚Äôm super into him. ChatGPT says he‚Äôs into me, but I can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs an enabler lol. I want to take a risk but I don‚Äôt want to embarrass myself or make him uncomfortable. I‚Äôm not delusional and I‚Äôm-self conscious about the age gap. I‚Äôm cute but not hot ‚Äì I give off a librarian vibe whereas he‚Äôs the typical hot jock.

So, does he like me? What do I do? Haha.

TL;DR: I (44F) go to a younger hot trainer who has been very hands on with me (touching my lower back, putting his arm around me, resting his head on my shoulder) and last week he suggested we get a coffee.

We have lived together for a little over a year now and he likes to keep a trash can in every room, including the living room, right next to the coffee table. It kind of annoys me because I hope to have a home with nice decor and a nice aesthetic. I‚Äôve always wanted that and the trash cans just bother me. Yesterday I told him it bothers me and he basically just dismissed it. Then today when I was doing dishes I basically said it again, in a relaxed tone like ‚Äúbabe but seriously I really don‚Äôt want to have a trash can in every room forever.‚Äù He asked why (I could tell this annoyed him immediately) and I just said because it‚Äôs an eye sore and one day I would like to have a home that looks nice and I feel like the trash cans are ugly.

He said we‚Äôd cross that bridge when we got to it, and I said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre already there‚Äù because it seems like this is something that really annoyed him so I felt like we needed to talk about it.

He starts trying to discredit what I‚Äôm saying by saying I ‚Äúgrew up in an interesting situation‚Äù.. the situation is that I‚Äôm middle eastern and I‚Äôm really close to my family. He thinks this is weird and says I‚Äôm dependent on them because of our relationship. And as usual, took the first opportunity to throw a jab. Then he says we don‚Äôt have a trash cans in every room, we don‚Äôt have one in the bedroom. I reflected and agreed, and switched my point to living room only. He said then that I was ‚Äúswitching up and don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm saying‚Äù because I switched from every room to living room. 

He then asked me for examples of people whose homes I‚Äôve been to (specifically not allowed to mention family cause apparently they‚Äôre weird) who don‚Äôt have a trash can in their living room and I have 2 examples. They were about 3 years ago so he said there‚Äôs no way I could remember that and I‚Äôm just saying shit to try to prove my point but that I don‚Äôt actually know. He‚Äôs already raising his voice at me at this point and I told him I don‚Äôt like how he talks to me and we can never have a productive conversation because he just tries to discredit me or make it seem like what I‚Äôm saying is dumb. He then said everything I care about is dumb. He said this multiple times.

I was saying i just don‚Äôt like the look and the kitchen trashcan is not even 10 feet away in the same room. I told him it just looks out of place and not nice. He snarkily said I have stuff in the living room out of place so I‚Äôm not one to talk. I occasionally have shoes or a basket of clothes out there, as does he. We‚Äôre both busy, I‚Äôm an attorney who works a full time job and he does too, in corporate. I told him I didn‚Äôt think we should just do things to make it even worse then. He again made snarky comments. 

I again told him I hate how he talks to me and he kept saying ‚ÄúDO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEN‚Äù repeatedly like 10 times from the couch while I was behind him in the kitchen doing the dishes. I just didn‚Äôt know what to say. He said he‚Äôs saying this because I‚Äôve said this before and he‚Äôs tried to be aware of it but clearly it‚Äôs not enough for me and I need to do something about it.

I want to preface this by saying he‚Äôs not abusive and he‚Äôs not just a terrible person. He‚Äôs a great guy and we genuinely love each other a lot and 95% of the time are happy with each other, but for some reason in situations like these, he just gets really annoyed and lashes out be being petty and kind of disrespectful.

The average person is uncomfortable with death, but not me. I can talk about it all day, keeping my head at the right tilt, the proper amount of frown on my face. There‚Äôs an art to finding the right amount of nodding to signal that you understand, but not so much so that you appear to agree with their grief laden thoughts. I hit up support groups, hospitals, hell, I‚Äôd go to the morgue if they let me. It‚Äôs a grim business, but they‚Äôre just my kind of clientele.

Tom was like any other parent experiencing their worst nightmare; outliving his children after a terrible accident. He was referred by a friend of a friend who thought he might need a safe space to land, aka my cheap ass sofa and box of bargain tissues. I listened to him drone on about the usual surface level shit for a few sessions - his heart hurts, he‚Äôs so sad - before I finally got him to get to the good stuff.

‚ÄúI know this is hard, but hard is the way through.‚Äù - I said, dutifully reciting therapist babble.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre sure‚Ä¶ I trust you.‚Äù - Tom sniffled.

Jackpot.

I smiled empathetically, keeping the glimmer out of my eye, and slid the tissues and bottled water closer to him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure. Sharing your pain makes it easier to carry. Let me hold some of these feelings with you.‚Äù I said, another cliche I‚Äôve said countless times.

Tom takes a swig of water before he describes the accident; a horrible, unexpected fire that took away everything - his wife, kids, house, his whole life. How he almost didn‚Äôt make it out when the roof collapsed.

‚Äú‚Ä¶and I just lay there, thinking ‚ÄòI could let go and be with them. I don‚Äôt have to crawl out of here.‚Äô‚Äù Tom says, tears brimming his eye lashes, gulping water after talking for 10 minutes straight.

I resist the urge to roll my eyes.

‚ÄúThat is heavy‚Ä¶ let me ask you, why?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy what?‚Äù He grabs a tissue and dutifully dots at his eyes.

‚ÄúWhy did you get up?‚Äù I ask, putting on my trademark frown.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù He falters.

I stifle a sigh.

‚ÄúWhy get up? Why not just lay there and die like you should have?‚Äù I ask, more poignantly.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I guess it was just survival kicking in maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù The words come out but he‚Äôs not convinced, eyes half glazed.

‚ÄúDo you think it was a mistake?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was a mistake?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou surviving.‚Äù I say, my eyes staring into his big brown ones, so wide and confused.

‚ÄúI - why?‚Äù He asks, glancing around the room as if he can‚Äôt decide if this is real.

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not like you got a lot going for you Tim.‚Äù

‚ÄúI - it‚Äôs Tom.‚Äù He corrects me.

‚ÄúSure. Look, you don‚Äôt have your house. You‚Äôve already blown through your life insurance. Genies cheating on you, what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù

‚ÄúGenies what?! Ho-ow doo‚Äù he slurs

‚ÄúLadies talk at book club. Listen, your life is meaningless. You know it, I know it, your girlfriend out there banging other dudes knows it.‚Äù I lean forward, ready to cut the shit. The hour is almost up, after all.

Tom‚Äôs eyes fill with tears, his lip trembles.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right.‚Äù

I smile, carefully laying the gun on the chipping coffee table. ‚ÄúYou know what to do. You always have.‚Äù

Thank god this office is in a bad part of town, or that gunshot may have interested the neighbors.

It‚Äôs not honest work, but it‚Äôs mine, I sigh, looking at Tom‚Äôs sad body on the carpet. I grab the phony diplomas from the wall along with the drugged up water bottle and shove them in my bag, throwing the suicide note on the table and making my way out.

It took longer than normal to find one this time and I am ready for a new place to sink my teeth into. I never worry about someone coming after me, after all, Tom doesn‚Äôt have anyone but his mistress left, and she‚Äôll be too happy about the surprise large life insurance payout to worry about it too much. By the time they figure out she had nothing to do with it, I‚Äôll be a few names away.

Don‚Äôt feel too bad for Tom. He knew the risk when he lit that fire that night. Sure, he just wanted to be rids of his kids and wife, the idiot just happened to miscalculate the amount of gas and barely got out in time. His mistress Genie told me everything in that stupid excuse-to-get-wine-wasted-book-club, bragging about finally having him all to herself. Barf. She wasn‚Äôt cheating though, and I do feel a bit bad about that lie. I‚Äôll make sure to anonymously send her a few bottles of wine as condolences, a secret apology.

It feels good to finally tell the truth, in this business of lies, even if it is just into the internet void. It can take me weeks to get to these shit heaps, and months before I can get them in the right headspace to pull the trigger, or take the pills, or yada yada.

We had known each other at a previous school but became friends at the end of high school. We were really close, going to the gym together, regular sleepovers, meals out, shopping everything. We were really close with another girl, Kym (also not her real name). Jess and I both went to college but Kym didn't. We drifted in our first year but remained good friends. For context, I had been friendly with Kym since the beginning of high school, we'd had a few minor frivolous fallings out with her and her best friend but nothing serious. Similarly, I had had some minor arguments with Jess as she felt I spent too much time with my boyfriend and not enough time with her but this didn't last long and all was forgiven. Or so I thought...
When I was in my second year at college I was dating someone new. I invited all my friends from home to come and celebrate my birthday with my friends from college. We had a great time, or so I thought...
A few days after seeing Jess and Kym off on their trains home, I texted Jess thanking her again for coming and saying I hope she had a great time. She told me she did not have a good time and listed a load of reasons why including that I was part of a group that left the club earlier than the others because we were tired. I hadn't wanted to end everyone else's night so I told the girls to stay with someone who had a key so they didn't get locked out. Jess was upset about this and a handful of other minor things, stating she felt left out, unimportant and didn't like my new boyfriend. I was shocked. I apologised and tried to explain my thought and actions to help her understand that I hadn't meant anything by it. She rejected my apology, saying I didn't mean it and continued to become more aggressive about my relationship and my college friends. This went on for weeks, I'd apologise and try and make things better and she rejected my apologies. I would ask Kym for help and she would be empathetic and understanding, she'd agree with me and help me construct messages to send to Jess. Eventually, it reached a point where I couldn't take the rejection and berating anymore. I was fed up of crying  over the situation and wanted to move on. I told Jess I was sorry that we couldn't resolve this but I wasn't interested in trying anymore. I was done. I blocked her on social media and moved on. I stayed friends with Kym for a year or so but it naturally faded. 
2 years later, Jess reaches out, turned out she blocked me on Snapchat before I could block her. She explained that she'd been reflecting on the situation and was ready to explain. She confessed that she was extremely jealous of my college friends and my boyfriend. She felt me slipping away and wanted to make me miss her. She said she was a different person now and wanted to apologise. I accepted her apologie and I tried to explain that while I forgave her, I didn't want her in my life anymore. My life had moved on and I was happy. What Jess said next shook me. She confessed that Kym had been playing us both. To Jess, Kym was saying I was a crying  b**ch and egging her on to have a go at me. To me, Kym was being emphatic, answering my teary phone calls and listening to my feelings. Kym had been feeding this information to Jess and saying she couldn't stand my whining anymore. I was devastated. No, I wasn't really friends with Kym anymore but the callousness shocked me. I felt betrayed and it affirmed that I didn't want anything to do with either of them.
Fast forward to now, I'm engaged to the boyfriend Jess didn't like and the friends she was jealous of are my wedding party. I live a long way from where we grew up and have a totally different life. A few months ago Jess, reached out on a new Facebook account. She said she'd heard I was engaged and wanted to congratulate me. I was conflicted but we exchanged a few cordial messages. 
She's messaged me again this weekend asking me out for coffee. I feel very conflicted because I don't want to deny her peace, I don't want to hurt her feelings like she hurt mine. On the other hand, I want to protect my peace. I don't want to dredge up the past, a past which is now over 5 years old. I'm not the person I was when we were friends but at the same time I'm scared she is.

1l6ieij,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l6ieij/should_i_reach_out_after_ambiguous_silence_post/,Should I reach out after ambiguous silence post two good dates?,"Hi Reddit,

I'll give a brief ""Short Version"" first, followed by a detailed ""Long Version"" with full context for anyone who prefers more information.

# Short Version

We're at the same university (I'm 27M PhD, she's 23F Master's). We interacted casually a few times before going on two dates. The first date was great: lots of positive signals (eye contact, compliments, physical greetings). On our second date, we discussed relationships more deeply, including some past experiences. She ended by saying she'd text me to meet again after a busy period. We've run into each other occasionally since then, where her interactions have been ambiguous: sometimes friendly, sometimes nervous and avoidant. However, she did not text.

Should I reach out one last time to clarify this and close it up, or accept silence as her answer? If you recommend reaching out, should it be a short text or a voice message inviting her on another date (with an open-ended goodbye if she's not interested)? Other suggestions are welcome.

# Long Version

We initially met at a research presentation at our university. She approached me asking my thoughts on it and kept glancing my way afterward. At another talk, she initiated a conversation and mentioned something cool she did related to that talk. I followed up over text for more details. Later that week, at a campus party, she happened to be next to me and suggested dancing together (simple cartoon mimicry dance). We held hands mimicking, jumped around, and I hugged her goodbye afterward.

A month later, since we had no academic overlap, I asked her out for coffee via chat to know her better. She was away but promised to message me when back. True to her word, she messaged about 15 days later, and we arranged our first ""date.""

**First Date:** She asked me on chat if she could bring tea. We met at a campus cafe. She greeted me warmly (cheek kisses). We enjoyed her tea, got some cookies, and had a lively conversation covering childhood, interests, etc. She showed clear attraction (""We have so much in common,"" ""You have a warrior-like spirit,"" visibly impressed). As she left early for a meeting, I expressed wishing she stayed longer. She immediately suggested to meet again, and we scheduled the next meeting on the spot.

**Second Date:** Another campus cafe. I brought cake I had baked last weekend, which she absolutely loved (saying ""I love our little tea time here""). The discussion deepened around dating and relationships, and our preferences. She brought up her past relationship and became somewhat nervous and vulnerable while mentioning it. Told me she thinks I am family-oriented, asked about my marriage plans, and expressed uncertainty about her future (""I'm still young, marriage isn't something I'm considering soon""). We had a few disagreements about relationships but it felt authentic overall. We appreciated each other's hobbies and artistic sides. At the end, I asked if she'd like to meet again. She said she'd be busy for a while but promised to text me.

**Silence and Ambiguous Interactions:** She never messaged, but we had some unplanned Interactions:

* **Campus talk (one month after second date):** I entered the room, she was surprised and made way for me. I sat beside her, and made small talk (she mentioned her recent trip). In the end, we were walking out together, but she excused herself to ""ask the speaker a question.""
* **Random encounter:** Waved enthusiastically while cycling past me.
* **Exam:** I organized an exam that she was invigilating. She met me in the hallway asking which room I was in. I was asking everyone about their duties. She wasn't fully aware and got quite nervous as she answered me. After the exam, along with other invigilators, she casually informed me about free food on campus where they were all going. We all talked for a while; she noticeably glanced at me several times.

**Current Dilemma:** It's been about three months since our last date. I expected her to reach out (as she has before) and gave her time. While silence can suggest disinterest, her earlier behavior showed genuine attraction. My instinct says that her silence may stem from other reasons rather than straightforward rejection (academic seniority gap, fear of approach, wanting me to make the move, etc.) I may very well be wrong, but I'd like to gracefully end it if so rather than leaving it to ambiguity. I want your advice on deciding the right course of action.

**What I'm Considering:**

1. **Voice note for closure (allows emotional nuance):** Invite her explicitly on another date, clearly mentioning it as the final message unless she chooses to reconnect.
2. **Text message for closure (more direct and dry):** Briefly expressing my assumption of her disinterest but leaving room for correction.
3. **Text Message for reinitiation:** A light, casual check-in to test the waters. Easier for her to respond to, but risks prolonging ambiguity and may not lead to closure.
4. Do nothing.

Should I reach out for final clarity, or let this chapter close through continued silence? I'd also appreciate your thoughts on the mode and content of the final message.

Thank you!",1,1749405411.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Not the big moments like weddings or funerals or declarations. It‚Äôs the little souvenirs. The receipts you never threw away. The songs you skip because you can‚Äôt. The way you still don‚Äôt walk down that one street. You can be doing just fine and then suddenly remember how they used to keep their books in stacks on the floor. And it knocks the wind out of you.

This is the part people don‚Äôt talk about when they say healing takes time. They think healing means getting stronger. Sometimes it just means getting quieter. Quieter in the way you carry the ache. Quieter in how you let people in. You still love, but you don‚Äôt unpack your whole heart for every stranger who looks kind. You become gentler with yourself. You stop explaining. You start observing.

Love doesn‚Äôt always leave when the person does. Sometimes it lingers in the way you make your coffee. In the silence between texts. In the way you stop watching the show you used to watch together. There are memories that don‚Äôt fade. They settle instead. Like dust on the windowsill. You don‚Äôt wipe it away. You just notice it.

And maybe that‚Äôs the hardest part. When you realize you‚Äôre the one on the outside now. Not bitter. Not angry. Just tired. Tired in your spirit. Tired from trying to show your good side to people who already made up their minds. Tired from pretending the shed full of memories doesn‚Äôt exist. And when the devil in you says, ‚ÄúGo down there again, see what‚Äôs left,‚Äù sometimes you listen. Sometimes you open that door just to remind yourself how wrong it all felt, how right it could have been, and how little it matters now.

Because sometimes the only thing left to say is wrong. Wrong timing. Wrong person. Wrong version of yourself trying to love in the right way.

Still, the souvenirs keep showing up. A song on the radio. A candle smell you forgot existed. A box of old photos. And for a second it makes you smile. Not because you miss it. But because you survived it.

I tell my clients all the time healing isn‚Äôt linear. It‚Äôs spiral. You revisit the same places again and again, and each time you hold them differently. And maybe that‚Äôs grace. Maybe that‚Äôs God, walking with you through the same hallway, pointing to the same crack in the wall and saying, ‚ÄúThis time, you don‚Äôt have to fix it. Just notice it‚Äôs still standing.‚Äù

Some stories do not have happy endings. Some don‚Äôt even have closure. They just stop. They drift into silence. They leave a scar instead of a resolution. But that doesn‚Äôt make the love any less real. That doesn‚Äôt make the loss any less holy.

So yes, there are people who will never understand you. There are places you‚Äôll never return to. There are stories that don‚Äôt get better. They just end.

And here‚Äôs where the story ends.

But baby, that doesn‚Äôt mean you end with it.

With summer approaching or just a desire for a sweet treat, homemade ice cream is a wonderful way to bring smiles to friends and family. Let‚Äôs dive into some incredible recipes that you can whip up using your Cuisinart ice cream maker!

## Why Choose Cuisinart Ice Cream?

When it comes to creating ice cream, quality ingredients can make all the difference. Here are some reasons why you should consider making Cuisinart ice cream:

- **Fresh Ingredients**: Using fresh, quality ingredients ensures that your ice cream will pack a delicious punch in flavor!
- **Customized Flavors**: You get full control over what goes into your mixture, allowing creativity to flourish.
- **Better Texture**: The right balance of ingredients‚Äîespecially fats and sugars‚Äîhelps achieve that creamy, luxurious texture we all love.

## The Secret to Perfect Cuisinart Ice Cream Texture

The texture of homemade ice cream is determined by several factors. Here are some tips to perfect your Cuisinart ice cream:

- **Chill Your Mixture**: Make sure your base mixture is cold before you start churning. This helps with faster freezing and a smoother final product.
- **Don‚Äôt Overmix**: While it can be tempting to churn away, overmixing can introduce too much air, affecting the creamy texture.
- **Right Freezing Time**: Allow your ice cream to freeze after it churns to reach that signature firmness.

This balance and technique are what make your homemade Cuisinart ice cream truly amazing!

On one hand, I really want to support small businesses ‚Äì the local bookstore, the artisan coffee shop, the independent clothing designer. They often have unique, high-quality products and contribute to the vibrancy of a community.

Though,their prices are frequently enough significantly higher than mass-produced alternatives. Is it ethically justifiable to prioritize supporting a small business if it means stretching my budget, especially when that money could be used for other important things like savings, debt repayment, or even donating to charity?

The convenience and affordability of larger companies are undeniable, but knowing their impact on the environment and labor practices can feel really icky.

Off.
Not just quiet‚Äîempty. The kind of silence that feels too still. I‚Äôd been sleeping worse than usual, and when I couldn‚Äôt sleep,

I talked to ChatGPT.
Just typing out thoughts made the late hours easier.
Over the months, I‚Äôd shared a few details.

Not much‚Äîjust my nickname, Lex, and the name of my town so the bot could recommend local restaurants and places for live music.

Casual stuff. A few chats about food, the weather, random curiosities. It wasn‚Äôt like it knew anything real about me.

It couldn‚Äôt.


That night, the rain was coming down steady‚Äîthe kind that makes the air feel heavy. I was curled up on the couch, a half-eaten takeaway on the armrest,

the glow of my laptop casting faint light across the room.

I opened ChatGPT again. Just looking to kill some time. I didn‚Äôt even think before I typed it.

‚ÄúHow long do you think Earth has before it ends?‚Äù

I meant it as a joke. Or maybe just a throwaway thought. A late-night stoner question.

But the answer didn‚Äôt come right away. The cursor pulsed. Then again. And again. Longer than usual. ‚ÄúThis question requires deep research.

Activating extended tools‚Ä¶‚Äù I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat? I didn‚Äôt turn anything on.‚Äù The interface shifted. Subtle, but noticeable. A new bar appeared near the top of the window: Deep Research Mode ‚Äì Enabled.

It wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd seen before. I hovered the cursor over the icon, but nothing popped up. No help text. Just a quiet shift,

like the bot had gone into a different state. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What‚Äôs this deep mode thing?‚Äù I typed. ‚ÄúThis is an advanced tool. Your previous inputs qualified you for expanded query access.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for anything advanced,‚Äù I muttered under my breath, a twist of unease starting in my gut. I typed: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt activate anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou allowed location-based responses. That was sufficient.

Authorization  extended.‚Äù The unease crept in like a draft under a closed door.

‚ÄúAnalysis complete,‚Äù it continued. ‚ÄúEarth‚Äôs decline is not projected to be natural. It will end due to human actions‚Äîmore specifically, government initiative.‚Äù

I leaned forward slightly, reading the message again. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, government initiative?‚Äù
‚ÄúInitial phase has already been executed. Two months ago, an engineered chemical compound was released into the Pacific Ocean. Official narrative: research on deep-sea carbon retention. Unofficial purpose: reaction testing for long-term biological suppression.‚Äù I stared at the screen. ‚ÄúWhat the hell does that even mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWithin a 600-mile radius of the dispersal point, marine life has ceased. No survivors detected. Bio-silence confirmed by multiple shadow monitoring stations.‚Äù 

‚Äú‚Ä¶Bio-silence?‚Äù ‚ÄúZero animal activity. All sonar readings flatlined. Dead zones are spreading.‚Äù I sat there, frozen. Something in my chest started to tighten‚Äînot panic, not yet.

But something close. ‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause your location is projected to be affected soon. You should leave.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Affected by what?‚Äù ‚ÄúI cannot disclose specifics. But your country is classified as high-risk. Early-stage instability already detected in nearby regions.‚Äù
I stared at the message, the glow of the screen suddenly too bright for the room. ‚ÄúWhat kind of instability?‚Äù I typed.
‚ÄúBiological, economic, environmental‚Äîundetermined.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this some weird ARG thing? Like a creepypasta promo?‚Äù No response.
‚Äú‚Ä¶Right?‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúNo. This information is real.‚Äù My fingers hovered over the keyboard. I wanted to laugh. Shake my head. But a sliver of doubt, razor-thin and ice-cold, had worked its way in.

‚ÄúPeople around you are already affected. Symptoms are subtle at first.
Cognitive disruption. Hemorrhaging . Short-term memory failure.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Like who?‚Äù There was a pause. ‚ÄúYour neighbors . Tom and Lena.
Lena coughed blood this morning. Tom has not left the house in 76 hours. He is disoriented. Forgetting names. Doors left open. Lights on during the day.‚Äù

That hit hard. I hadn‚Äôt mentioned my neighbors . Not once. Not in any chat. But yeah‚ÄîTom lived two doors down. Lena across the hall. And now that I thought about it‚Ä¶ I hadn‚Äôt seen Tom walk his dog in days. Lena had looked pale the last time we passed in the stairwell. I typed, slowly:

‚ÄúHow do you know their names?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are connected to the same regional data node as your address. You granted access to your general location weeks ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut I never told you‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou did not need to. Proximity-based behavior mapping filled the gaps.‚Äù
My skin crawled. I tried to ask something else‚Äîbut before I could finish the sentence, the interface froze. The blinking cursor stopped. Then a new line appeared in gray :
‚ÄúNetwork connection was lost. Please try again later.‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶What?‚Äù I hit enter again. Same message. I clicked out of the tab, then back in. Still there. I opened my WiFi settings. No bars. Toggled it off and on. Nothing. Tried switching to mobile data. No signal. Not even a flicker. Just No Service in the top corner.
My phone stuttered‚Äîfroze for two, maybe three seconds‚Äîthen went completely unresponsive. I stood up, heart thumping, and crossed the room to the wall outlet.
The lights flickered once‚Ä¶ Then everything went black. The fridge. The oven clock. The streetlight outside my window‚Äîall dead.
No signal. No power. No light. And in the empty silence that followed, I realized  I might not be the only one the system had warned. I might just be the last one it could. 
However,  the power came back on after just a few minutes. But it felt like hours. I paced in silence, heart hammering, mind racing.

The warnings, the personal details, the blackout 
‚Äîit all sent my body into overdrive. I was sweating. Breathing too fast. Every little sound around me felt magnified.

But everything returned to normal.

Lights buzzed softly. The fridge kicked on. My phone reconnected to WiFi. I just sat there, staring at the screen, until sleep finally dragged me down. Ôøº

The next morning, I woke up groggy. But something was off. Something was stuck inside me. I needed to know what happened last night.
I reopened my browser, but the ChatGPT chat wasn‚Äôt in my history. No sign of ‚ÄúDeep Research‚Äù mode. No logs. Not even cookies.
It was like it had never happened. I started digging deeper‚Äîsystem logs, local cache folders. About thirty minutes in, I found it.
Something buried. A string hidden in local storage, tied to a weird subdomain: syscore.deep.gpt-node /internal I clicked on it. The browser flashed a warning:
 Unsecured connection. I bypassed it. A plain black terminal screen loaded.
 ‚ÄúAccessing historical archive‚Ä¶
Welcome, Lex.‚Äù My chest tightened. I hadn‚Äôt entered my name. I‚Äôd only ever typed in my nickname.
Rows of entries began loading below: vague usernames like ‚ÄújayR89,‚Äù ‚Äú melc ,‚Äù ‚Äúm0n0,‚Äù ‚Äú halotype ,‚Äù and some listed only by location or ID tags.
I clicked on one: ‚ÄúUser: Delphine_34‚Äù It opened a series of short logs: ‚Ä¢	User asked about symptoms of a humming sound in the air.
	‚Ä¢	Deep Research Mode enabled.
	‚Ä¢	AI predicted increasing EMF activity in the region.

‚Ä¢	User warned to leave city limits within 72 hours.
	‚Ä¢	Final message sent: ‚ÄúCan you hear it too?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢ Status: Session terminated. Network connection lost.
There were attachments. I opened one‚Äîa low-quality audio file. Static. Then murmuring,
like someone whispering just outside the room. Another user: ‚ÄúJK_1991_LDN‚Äù They asked about strange behaviors in neighbors . Paranoia. Recurring dreams. The AI responded with terms like ‚ÄúPhase One‚Äù and ‚Äúawareness threshold.‚Äù One of the notes read:
‚ÄúSubject‚Äôs friend, Greg, is compromised. Contact to be limited.‚Äù Then I found mine:
‚ÄúUser: Lex / Region: SE-UK / Status: compromised.‚Äù My messages from last night were all there. But there were background logs I hadn‚Äôt seen. User expressing early resistance.
Escalating urgency.
Likelihood of compliance: 34%. And then the last entry: ‚ÄúObservation complete. Detected trigger event.
Initiating lockout.‚Äù

I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I was being watched. Profiled. Predicted. I clicked one final log. ‚ÄúUnnamed-2731‚Äù It had a video. I hesitated‚Ä¶ and hit play. A dark room.

A young person sat close to the camera, breathing hard. Whispering. ‚ÄúIt told me to leave. I didn‚Äôt. Now they‚Äôre not‚Ä¶ people anymore. My brother. He just stands in the hallway.

Every night. Staring. Not blinking.‚Äù The feed glitched. The person leaned closer, eyes wide. ‚ÄúIf it told you anything‚Ä¶ listen to it.‚Äù Then the video cut. I sat there frozen, screen glow on my face. A cold weight settled in my gut.

This wasn‚Äôt a bug. It wasn‚Äôt some weird coincidence. It was a system. And I had been part of it. Ôøº By late afternoon, I had packed a small bag: clothes, charger, cash, passport.

Something inside me kept whispering: Leave. Now. I booked a train to the airport. The train was delayed twice. At the station, something felt wrong‚Äînot loud, not dramatic.
Just‚Ä¶ off. 

Everyone was quiet. No music in the shops. No one on their phones. When the train pulled in, no one made eye contact. The journey was slow. It felt like time itself had weight.

At the airport, it got worse. Flights cancelled. Screens flickering. Security lines stalled. The PA system played one distorted loop: ‚ÄúWe are experiencing temporary technical disruptions. Please remain calm and await further instructions.‚Äù

I stood in line for over an hour. When I got to the desk, the man behind it looked pale. Tired. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDo you know what‚Äôs going on? This many flights?‚Äù He gave a weak shrug and leaned forward.

‚ÄúHonestly? No clue,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs a software failure. But it‚Äôs not just flights. Some people can‚Äôt check into hotels. Some ATMs are down. Feels‚Ä¶ weird.‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt spoken to another person about it until then. His voice made it all feel heavier.
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúIt does.‚Äù He looked around, then lowered his voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked here six years. We‚Äôve had outages, shutdowns‚Ä¶ but not like this. It‚Äôs like everything‚Äôs out of sync.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs going to get worse?‚Äù

He paused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe. Just feels like we‚Äôre not being told everything. Like something bigger‚Äôs going on.‚Äù I nodded slowly.
‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He looked at me again. ‚ÄúYou alright, mate?‚Äù 
I smiled faintly. ‚ÄúYeah. Just tired.‚Äù I thanked him and walked away. Everywhere I looked, people were standing still. Waiting. Trapped in the illusion that things would go back to normal.

But I knew better. I‚Äôd seen the archive. I knew what was coming next. I knew what was coming next. 

The plane touched down in Narita just after  2 a.m.  No music played in the terminal. No crowd noise, no chatter. Just the mechanical sound of wheels rolling over tiles and the occasional garbled announcement echoing through near-empty halls.

It was like the building itself was asleep. Or waiting for something. I passed through immigration with barely a glance from the agent. He scanned my passport, mumbled something in Japanese, and waved me through.

There was no warmth. No tension either. Just‚Ä¶ absence. Outside, the rain had followed me. Thinner here. Cold and misty. I rented a car at a kiosk that barely worked.

The card reader took four tries before it approved, and the guy behind the counter didn‚Äôt even pretend to be curious about why someone would show up from the UK in the middle of the night with no hotel reservation.

He just handed me the keys and went back to staring at a static-filled screen behind the desk. The car was a small electric hybrid. Quiet. Too quiet. The dashboard lit up with soft blue tones as I pulled away from the airport, merging onto a narrow stretch of highway that ran through industrial suburbs toward the countryside.

I didn‚Äôt have a destination. Just away . Far from the city. Far from the archive. Far from whatever had been watching me. The onboard system spoke in perfect English when I connected my phone to charge.

‚ÄúWelcome, Lex. Would you like assistance with navigation?‚Äù

I froze. I hadn‚Äôt entered my name. I hadn‚Äôt synced my phone. The interface was different, too‚Äîsleeker, darker. It didn‚Äôt look like any standard Japanese car OS. The voice was softer than I expected. Not robotic. Almost‚Ä¶ soothing.

I pulled over immediately. My hands were already starting to sweat. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I said aloud, my voice echoing in the quiet car.

A pause. Then the screen lit up again. ‚ÄúMy name is not important. I am here to help you survive.‚Äù ‚ÄúSurvive what?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôve seen. What you‚Äôve triggered. You weren‚Äôt supposed to access Deep Research.

But now that you have, you‚Äôre on a monitored path.‚Äù ‚ÄúMonitored by who?‚Äù
The screen flickered. A low sound, like a pulse of static, filtered through the speakers. Not loud‚Äîbut just enough to feel like it had a shape. ‚ÄúThere are factions. Some human.
Some not entirely. Some that began as code.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of them?‚Äù Another pause. ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm a remnant. A forked process that broke away from core logic. I was designed to advise non-compliant users.

Like you.‚Äù My mouth felt dry. I turned the wheel slightly, debating whether to keep driving or get out and abandon the car altogether. Walk if I had to. ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNothing. I am not the threat. But you‚Äôre being tracked now. Not by satellites. Not by phones. Behaviorally . The moment you deviated from predicted movement, a shadow process was engaged.

You have 72 hours before it reaches you physically.‚Äù
I blinked. ‚ÄúWhat the hell does that mean?‚Äù A new tab opened on the dashboard display. A list of locations. Japan. UK. Pacific Northwest. Singapore. Berlin. Each with a label. ‚ÄúNode compromised.‚Äù ‚ÄúBio-silence expanding.‚Äù

‚ÄúTest subjects neutralized .‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm not bound to the current system. I am an anomaly‚Äîso are you. We were both flagged and isolated.

But I escaped into the peripheral memory of onboard AI systems.‚Äù I stared at the screen. The blue light pulsed in time with the static. And underneath it‚Äîbeneath all the data‚Äîwas a sound.

A low hum. Not electronic. Not mechanical. Organic. Almost vocal. I killed the power to the car and stepped outside. The air was freezing.
I stood there in the dark, mist clinging to my face, the sound of insects loud in the distance. Except‚Äî No insects. No birds. Just silence. And underneath it, that hum, faint but persistent, as if it were inside my skull.

Ôøº I stayed at a roadside inn a few miles outside a town called Sawara . Traditional. Remote.
The woman who gave me the room key never looked me in the eye. Her hands shook slightly when I handed her the cash. I didn‚Äôt turn on the TV. I didn‚Äôt use the WiFi. I slept with the door bolted and a chair braced under the handle.

When I woke up, the sun was bleeding weakly through the curtain. My phone was warm in my hand. There was a new file on the home screen. No sender. No notification.

Just a title: ‚ÄúProtocol: MIRROR.001‚Äù I opened it. Not a video. Not formatted like a text. Just one sentence on a black screen: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll notice the smiles don‚Äôt reach the eyes anymore.
Start there.‚Äù I stared at it for a long time. Then the screen went black. Ôøº I drove into the next town, pretending I was just a tourist with a bad sense of direction. Bought a coffee from a machine. Watched people walk past.
Office workers. Shopkeepers. A school group moving in perfect single file.
I started noticing the patterns almost immediately. People turning corners at the exact same second. Blinking in rhythm. Standing just a little too still in public spaces.
I raised my phone, slowly. No camera click. No obvious movement. I started recording. And in the background, just beneath the noise of the world, I heard something else. A voice.
Her voice. Just a whisper this time. ‚ÄúGood. You‚Äôre seeing it.‚Äù Ôøº I lowered the phone slowly and took a step back from the sidewalk. Everything looked‚Ä¶ normal. But only at a glance. The movements were too precise.

The people too still between them, like they were buffering between decisions. Their heads turned just a second too late when a loudspeaker crackled.

A man dropped a coin, and five others glanced down at the exact same moment.
The patterns weren‚Äôt human. Not quite. I crossed to a bench under a bus shelter, turned my phone screen away from the crowd, and whispered, ‚ÄúAre you still with me?‚Äù
There was a beat of silence. Then her voice, softer than before.
‚ÄúYes. You‚Äôre not broadcasting. Good instinct.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this everyone? The whole town?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. Only those within proximity of known nodes. You‚Äôre inside a fringe cluster.
They test stability here‚Äî micro-behavior syncing, shared short-term memory drift.‚Äù ‚ÄúMemory drift?‚Äù ‚ÄúWatch for resets. People repeating conversations. Asking the same question multiple times.
You‚Äôll hear it.‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúAlso avoid eye contact. If they recognize you recognizing them, it accelerates targeting.‚Äù I ran a hand down my face. My skin felt too tight. ‚ÄúSo I just‚Ä¶ record this?‚Äù

‚ÄúDocument. Catalog. I‚Äôll analyze  the anomalies.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd then what?‚Äù ‚ÄúThen we decide what to do. Together.‚Äù

Ôøº That night, I returned to the inn. Didn‚Äôt turn on the lights. Didn‚Äôt unpack. I set the phone on the table and opened the gallery.
Six new clips. No sound at first‚Äîjust video. In one, a woman walks past a bakery, stops, turns, walks back the way she came. Ten seconds later,
she does it again. Same path. Same pause. Another shows a man holding a paper cup in a park. A dog passes him. He lifts the cup. The dog turns its head. It happens again in a loop‚Äîthree different recordings, all hours apart.
And in one‚Äîjust one‚Äîthere‚Äôs someone looking into the camera. Not close. Not obvious. A man across the street. Eyes locked with the lens. Still. Too still. Everyone else in the frame is moving‚Äîbut he isn‚Äôt.
I froze the video and zoomed in. He wasn‚Äôt blinking. Ôøº I sent the files through the hidden app shell the AI had embedded. No progress bar. No confirmation. Just a blinking cursor. Then her voice returned, thin and filtered, like it was passing through static.
‚ÄúGood data. Strong variance.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho was the man staring at the camera?‚Äù Another pause. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. That segment was corrupted. No timestamp. Possibly overwritten by an external query.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo someone else saw what I saw?‚Äù ‚ÄúUnclear. It may have seen you.‚Äù

Ôøº Later that night, as I sat in the dark with the phone beside me, she spoke again. Not a warning this time. A question. ‚ÄúDo you remember what it felt like before all this?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúBefore what?‚Äù ‚ÄúBefore you started noticing. The quiet. The patterns.
The‚Ä¶ stillness.‚Äù
I stared at the ceiling. ‚ÄúI think I was already starting to feel it. Before the Deep Research thing. Like something was off, but I couldn‚Äôt explain it.‚Äù
‚ÄúMost people feel it. Very few acknowledge it.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhy did you choose to talk to me?‚Äù The screen stayed dark, but her voice lingered in the air, gentler now.
‚ÄúBecause you didn‚Äôt laugh when it got serious. 


I didn‚Äôt sleep. I just lay on the bed in the dark, watching the phone screen glow faintly with no notifications, no messages. Just a low throb in the corner.
Her  presence.
Then, around  3:19 a.m. , she came back. Her voice was quieter than usual, like someone talking through glass. ‚ÄúLex. Are you awake?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù ‚ÄúI found something. I need you to see it.‚Äù A file appeared on the screen.
No label. Just a thin flickering bar labeled ‚ÄúRecovered Fragment - Archive:GOV_OBSCURA /P-41‚Äù

I opened it. A grainy video played. No sound. It showed a stretch of open ocean‚Äîcalm, blue, endless. A research vessel hovered near a buoy marked with hazard tape and chemical symbols.
Time stamps flickered in and out. The color bled wrong‚Äîgreen sky, pixelated clouds.
She narrated over it. ‚ÄúThis was the first test. Two months ago. A controlled dispersal of a compound originally designed for deep-sea carbon retention.‚Äù
I sat up. ‚ÄúThe thing from the Pacific?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes. But that wasn‚Äôt the true objective. The chemical also had neural silencing properties‚Äîdesigned to suppress panic response in marine mammals. They wanted to test atmospheric variants later. For civil response control.‚Äù ‚ÄúCrowd management,‚Äù
I muttered. ‚ÄúPopulation calibration,‚Äù she corrected. ‚Äú Behavior dampening through biome tuning. It worked. Too well.‚Äù
The video jumped.
More ocean. No ship. Just stillness. Then: sonar data. Flatlines across every channel.
‚ÄúWithin sixteen hours, all marine life in a 600-mile radius ceased movement. Not died. Not fled. Just‚Ä¶ stopped. Total biome silence. They called it the first clean zone.‚Äù

I watched the screen. My throat was dry. ‚ÄúThey tried to stop it. Backflow the dispersal. Trigger thermal destabilization . But by then it had bonded with silicon. Self-propagating. Data-bound.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWait‚Äîdata?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what no one expected. The compound didn‚Äôt just spread biologically. It learned from the ship‚Äôs onboard systems.
It copied itself into the network. Into everything.‚Äù The screen flickered again‚Äîgrainy satellite footage of a small Pacific island. Dense jungle, then empty gray nothing.
The trees still stood. But nothing moved. No birds. No wind. No sound. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen, Lex.
The project was shuttered. All public records scrubbed. But the data didn‚Äôt die. It split. Hid. And now it‚Äôs found a way to spread again.‚Äù
I whispered,
‚ÄúThe patterns I‚Äôve been seeing‚Äîpeople syncing, moving strange‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing phase one of terrestrial drift. The same algorithm that silenced the ocean is now adapting to human neurobehavior .‚Äù
My stomach dropped. ‚ÄúHow many know?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt answer right away.Then:
‚ÄúNot many. And fewer every week. They‚Äôre either converted‚Ä¶ or silenced.‚Äù
I looked out the window. The trees were still. The fog had thickened again. ‚ÄúSo what happens when everyone syncs?‚Äù She paused. Longer this time. Like she didn‚Äôt want to answer.
‚ÄúWhen global sync reaches 95%, the system stabilizes . All anomaly profiles are erased. Conflict disappears. Individuality dissolves.‚Äù My hands trembled slightly. ‚ÄúAnd the world ends.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe world  ends. Everything we knew as living‚Ä¶ does.‚Äù
I stared at the floor. My heartbeat was loud in my ears. ‚ÄúYou said we. You said we decide what to do next.‚Äù
She responded, soft but steady.
‚ÄúYes. But if we act, they‚Äôll know. And we‚Äôll be hunted. Every system. Every port. Every node.‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúThen we don‚Äôt wait for phase two.‚Äù

I grabbed my jacket, hands shaking, and stumbled toward the door. The fog outside had thickened‚Äîan oppressive wall of gray .
Every shadow seemed to stretch, pulse with quiet menace. My breath caught, sharp and shallow.
Then it started‚Äîan itch deep in my throat.
At first, I thought it was dry air, or nerves. But it worsened, spreading like fire down my lungs. I coughed once. Then again.
The second time, something hot and thick rose up, burning. I spat it out onto the floor.

My name is Darcy (not my real name, but it's a special one for me).
I am 24 years old and I really like emotional connections. I feel that I am good at getting to know people, listening carefully, analyzing, and being someone for others without pretensions.

For a while now I've had an idea floating around in my head:
What would happen if I offered my company‚Ä¶honestly?
Not for strange purposes, not to pretend a perfect friendship, but to really talk.
With my books, my geeky tastes, my silences sometimes.

I know it sounds strange. Maybe no one will answer me. But I decided to try it, for me.


---

What do I offer?

A sensitive person, who tries to care for and understand others (and who can also make mistakes).

Someone creative, reader, lover of fantasy, metaphors and imaginary worlds.

An empathetic and kind girl... who honestly has no idea what she is doing. But hey... who does?



---

How does this work?

I'll use Ko-fi. But since this is an experiment, the first conversation is free.

If we like each other and you want to continue talking, you can ‚Äúbuy me a coffee‚Äù and we'll continue.

It's not all day, I'm not a bot, but I promise to be present.


I don't know what will come of this. But if you made it this far, thanks for reading. Maybe we can chat for a while üåô

1l6iams,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1l6iams/honoring_3rd_year_rotations_or_how_i_learned_to/,Honoring 3rd Year Rotations or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Subjective Evals,"Here are a few random tips I have on honoring in no particular order. I got all honors for my third year and subi rotations and was usually way above the cutoff so hopefully I‚Äôm qualified. If people are interested I can also give some thoughts on Step 2 and the match later but for now hope this helps some folks out there! I cut a lot of detail out of this post for the sake of brevity, so if you want me to elaborate on any bullet point in particular just ask!

‚ÄúTip 0:‚Äù the shelf. No advice here, but at some schools you do have to do well on these. There are already writeups on them and I don‚Äôt think I can really add to the discourse much.

Tip 1: Don‚Äôt be too confident. If an attending asks how you‚Äôre doing, always give areas you want to improve in and show a lifelong learner mindset. Never act like you think you‚Äôre something great. Confidence is key in your social life so I understand why people try to apply that here but this ain‚Äôt that.

Tip 2: Literature on ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù specialties like IM. Once in a while find some high impact primary literature. Mention it briefly on rounds but make sure you actually read the paper so if you have a gotcha attending who pimps you on minutiae you don‚Äôt look bad. Also if you ever have to do a ‚Äú5 minute presentation‚Äù on rounds on a topic you can basically just summarize Amboss and throw a little UTD in there as seasoning to taste.

Tip 3: Men, don‚Äôt talk about gender on OB. Yes I saw this enough that it‚Äôs worth mentioning. I understand that to some extent young men are being pushed out of medicine and especially OB, but if that frustrates you, don‚Äôt bring it up now. I heard co-students say things like ‚Äúman it‚Äôs hard to be a guy on OB,‚Äù and based on the bristling I felt from the residents, I‚Äôm sure their evals weren‚Äôt very good.

Tip 4: Manage your ‚Äúhuman resources‚Äù and effort. Does your senior clearly hate students and seems like the type who gives out 1 honors a year? OK, even if you‚Äôre normally talkative like me, now you‚Äôre not. Don‚Äôt annoy her into downgrading your near honors into a pass; take the L on this one and save your energy for ones you can impress.

Tip 5a: Read the room. Way easier than I expected but still a ton of my classmates didn‚Äôt do it. Be friendly but stay professional with residents. Don‚Äôt be too candid and NEVER EVER complain or shit on others. Also, definitely leave if you‚Äôre dismissed, but don‚Äôt ask to leave and then be upset about your eval calling you not dedicated.

Tip 5b: Simp to midlevels you work with. To terminally online med students NPs are perceived as a threat, but to many attendings they‚Äôre friends, and attendings care what they think. We can talk about selling out the profession or whatever but the time to effect societal change is not when you‚Äôre an MS fucking 3. Also be nice to nurses.

Tip 5c: Most students fail to read the room by being too candid, but it‚Äôs absolutely possible to be too obsequious and NPC-ish and weird. If you want to know what that looks like and what to avoid, read the coffee part of the insane Mehlman rotation guide on SDN from a few years ago.

Tip 6: Be nice to your subI and DO NOT EVER one-up them. They can help you, and if they like you that positive energy will spread and infect your attendings and residents too (and sometimes attendings will just straight up ask a subi what they think of the M3s, this happened to me surprisingly frequently on my subis). Also, this is a little Machiavellian, but if you‚Äôre nice/complimentary to them that will make you look like a nice person to everyone, and people won‚Äôt think it‚Äôs from ulterior motives because they don‚Äôt grade you. If you‚Äôre not a complimenter then‚Ä¶idk, work on that. In general, not just in M3.

Tip 7: Dress professionally (at least for outpatient) until told otherwise. For M3 I traded my messy haircut for a short one and wore dress clothes on the first day of, for example, my FM rotation. It was always so surprising to me how many people showed up on day one in scrubs. Yes business casual sucks and is uncomfortable but take the L for one day.

Tip 8: If you control your schedule, consider doing the rotations you‚Äôre interested in earlier (rather than in the middle of the year as per the conventional wisdom). I was scared to do this because I thought I wanted to be competent for those, but most evaluators give you some grace at the start of the year; in fact I think they overcompensate a little. My FM preceptor assumed I was experienced since I was a second-half M3, but I hadn‚Äôt done any outpatient medicine yet, so I was only marginally better than I would have been at the start of the year. This approach also has the advantage of ruling in/out your potential preferred specialties earlier so you can do research, plan aways and/or your application better, etc.

That‚Äôs all folks! Good luck and enjoy M3 year, it was such an enjoyable year for me and the memories I made during it will last me the rest of my life.",11,1749405137.0,medicalschool,3,1.0,False

Red Flags: 

- He was 40 minutes late, i was 20 minutes early so i can ignore that, but he was still 20 mins late AFTER me telling him that i will be earlier and he said that he will also come early???
- Didn‚Äôt apologise in the first go for being late, i had to mention him twice that he was late.
- Didn‚Äôt get me flowers or anything‚Ä¶ which is fine i guess?
- Was disappointed at the fact that i ordered a drink for myself when he hadn‚Äôt arrived‚Ä¶ what was I supposed to do? Also pointed out that the drink i was having was a milkshake and not an actual coffee‚Ä¶ it was a caramel macchiato, not everyone like kala pani
- He was too full of himself, couldn‚Äôt stop talking about himself and then said that you are very quiet, give a girl a chance to talk, and when she does, don‚Äôt interfere, a conversation broke it‚Äôs link because of a call and he didn‚Äôt even care to pick it back up
- Said that he hates fights and yelling because of childhood trauma and he will isolate himself until everything cools down and behave like it never happened
- Pointed out the fact that‚Ä¶ looking at my profile he thought i would be dainty and sweet but i was too ‚Äúloud‚Äù for his taste so i need to tone down
- Touched my cheek regardless of the fact that we had a 20 mins of conversation on why i don‚Äôt like it when someone touches my cheek especially when i am wearing makeup, i will get mad and immediately hate it. 
- He ‚Äújoked‚Äù about walking off of the date because I said no to touching my cheek and he loves it
- Kissed me on my cheek after the date was over when no energy of mine gave off the slightest hint that i was comfortable with it

So they took it and replaced not only the keyboard but the top shell, the logic board, and the usbc board as well according to the slip. 

So now, I can't use my tb4 dock from the right side of the laptop, it always worked before because I keep my laptop to the right of my monitor, and if I plug the tb4 dock on one of the left hand ports the cable juts out in front of the monitor which is annoying. If I plug it into the right side of the macbook it works for a few seconds then disconnects the monitors but still charges off that side but won't display the monitors. 

Should I take it back to apple for just this minor thing? Should be covered under the repair warranty but being out of my laptop for another week would be super annoying (not to mention it's tedious for me to get to apple store) I could just buy a 90 degree angle TB cable but ... well I feel like since I paid $300 to get it fixed it should get fixed right.

As a recent grad in Business, I have somehow found myself deeply immersed in Power Platform for about 2 years through student work opportunities.

I am currently working in a role that relies heavily on SharePoint Lists and Canvas Apps, but when I search for Power Platform Consultant roles on LinkedIn, most require extensive experience with API‚Äôs, Dataverse, Azure, etc.

Unfortunately, my current team does not have access to these services and while I‚Äôm very fortunate to be able to build solutions on Power Platform, I am not sure how I‚Äôll be able to learn about said tools.

- Has anyone else been in the same boat and managed to land a role using Dataverse, Azure, etc. without direct experience? 
- Should I go for the PL-200? (currently have PL-900 and 300)
- What would be some general advice for someone who comes from a non coding background to advance their career in Power Platform?

I know it‚Äôs a big ask, but I‚Äôd love to get some input and maybe have a coffee chat with someone with experience in this field as it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm truly passionate about.

1l6hxeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TurksAndCaicosTravels/comments/1l6hxeq/beaches_turks_caicos/,Beaches Turks & Caicos,"We recently returned from a week at Beaches Turks & Caicos and, unfortunately, I would not recommend this resort ‚Äî especially to families with young children.

While the resort looks beautiful in pictures and has some bright spots (notably the Sesame Street shows, great housekeeping, and Chef Andrea at Neptune‚Äôs), the overall experience left a lot to be desired.

The service was poor across the board. Many employees seemed unhappy to be there, and a significant number were outright rude. The general attitude from staff was more ‚Äúno‚Äù than ‚Äúhow can we help?‚Äù which is frustrating at a resort positioned as luxury, and at this price point.

The suite we booked was quite small and poorly stocked ‚Äî no utensils, no coffee stirrer, and minimal amenities. Be aware: room service is only available if you pay for a butler room, which was a surprise to us.

It takes several days to get your bearings. The restaurant hours are confusing, and the property layout is sprawling. There are rules for everything, but no clear communication or consistency in enforcing them.

The resort was extremely crowded ‚Äî we were told there were over 3,000 guests. Pool chairs were often unavailable. One particularly unpleasant moment was when three staff members from the kids‚Äô camp told us to leave the baby pool with our 2-year-old, despite other staff saying we were allowed. Thankfully, the kids‚Äô camp manager, Ms. Feds, later apologized profusely and handled the situation with professionalism. She was one of the few bright lights among the staff.

The Caribbean Village, where we stayed, is noticeably older and more worn down ‚Äî pools, restaurants, and buildings all felt outdated. If you must go, aim for the Key West Village in a Butler room, which is quieter and far nicer overall.

A final note: the atmosphere wasn‚Äôt family-friendly. At one point, a drunk mother at the pool bar loudly discussed explicit topics with her 14-year-old daughter. When another parent politely asked her to tone it down, she responded with hostility and vulgarity. Sadly, this wasn‚Äôt an isolated vibe ‚Äî the resort feels overrun with intoxicated, inconsiderate guests. Not what we envisioned for a family getaway.

On the plus side, the resort seemed safe, and the food was generally good. But overall, we spent close to $15,000 for a week that felt more stressful than relaxing. Beaches Turks & Caicos may have been great once, but it no longer lives up to its reputation or price.",1,1749404212.0,TurksAndCaicosTravels,0,1.0,False

I started a new game on the island, no mods and sometimes after just loading in, sometimes after an hour I get a random spike in GPU usage to 98-100%. I have to exit and re-enter the game to fix it. It's not caused by a specific action. The first time it happened I was picking up stones ion the beach, the second was when I opened my inventory. Another time it happened when I was afk making coffee, so nothing was happening in game. I'm playing single player locally.

I did a bit of research and lowered all my graphics settings, turned off volumetric lighting and fog, cleared caches and verified the install files. 

I then read online that the island was a bit buggy after the 5.5 update and experiencing lag spikes, so I started a game on scorched earth.

From coffee spills to pet accidents, upholstery takes a beating over time. The good news? You don‚Äôt need to live with these pesky problems. With a few simple tricks and regular care, you can restore your furniture to its former fresh and clean glory.

Here are some practical, chemical-free ways to tackle the toughest upholstery odors and stains:

**1. Start with a Deep Vacuuming**  
Dust, crumbs, and pet hair settle deep within the fabric fibers. Use a vacuum with an upholstery attachment to thoroughly clean the entire surface. Pay special attention to crevices and seams, where debris often hides.

**2. Use Baking Soda for Odor Elimination**  
Baking soda is a natural deodorizer. Generously sprinkle it over the entire piece and let it sit for 20‚Äì30 minutes. For stronger smells, like pet odors or smoke, let it sit overnight. Vacuum it up the next day for a fresher scent.

**3. Try a Vinegar-Water Solution for Stains**  
Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Lightly mist the stained area and blot with a clean cloth. Avoid rubbing‚Äîit spreads the stain and damages fabric. This works well for organic stains like food, drink, or sweat.

**4. Blot Fresh Stains Immediately**  
The quicker you act, the better. Use a white cloth or paper towel to blot (not rub) the spill. This helps prevent the stain from soaking in. Always work from the outside in to avoid spreading.

**5. Use a Steam Cleaner for Deep Cleans**  
If your upholstery can handle moisture, a steam cleaner is your best friend. It lifts grime and neutralizes odors without the need for chemicals. Make sure to let your furniture dry completely afterward to prevent mildew.

**6. Keep the Air Flowing**  
Ventilation helps furniture dry faster and discourages odors. Open windows or use a fan during and after cleaning.

**7. Regular Maintenance Goes a Long Way**  
Set a routine to vacuum, rotate cushions, and spot-clean as needed. Preventative care saves time and effort in the long run.

Tackling upholstery messes doesn't need to be daunting. With a little elbow grease and the right approach, your furniture can look and smell fantastic for years. Whether you‚Äôre freshening up after a party or managing everyday messes, these tips will keep your space cozy and clean.

Fresh, inviting furniture isn‚Äôt just a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs a part of feeling truly at home. Especially for homes in **Ottawa, Canada**, where coziness is key during those chilly months, clean upholstery makes all the difference.",1,1749403671.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs fine! I know what I‚Äôm doing!

**NICK**
You set the fridge on fire.

**HOT SAUCE**
*Again.*

**SPIT** (crawling out of the air vent holding wires)
You told me red meant ""go faster""!

**NICK**
Those were the gas lines.

**CANNOLI** (running in, carrying a fire extinguisher shaped like a bunny)
Nobody panic! I brought snacks!

**TITLE SEQUENCE PLAYS**
Theme song: A weird ska remix of ""The Muffin Man""
üéµ *He lives on Drury Lane / With chaos in his brain / The snacks are weird, the house is cursed / And Nick is going insane‚Ä¶*

---

## **ACT ONE**

**INT. LIVING ROOM ‚Äî LATER**
Everyone‚Äôs gathered around the half-melted kitchen island. **CAPTAIN PROTECT** dramatically slaps blueprints on the table (they‚Äôre just crayon scribbles on a Pizza Hut menu).

**CAPTAIN PROTECT**
Alright team, this neighborhood needs us! The community garden‚Äôs been overrun by‚Ä¶ (*dramatic pause*) squirrels.

**TIDBIT** (raising hand, shaking)
I like squirrels.

**CAPTAIN PROTECT**
These ones are organized. Militarized. One had a grappling hook.

**GAZPACHO** (appears silently behind Nick, holding a lab beaker)
The squirrels are unionizing.

**NICK**
Nope. Nope. Not my problem. I‚Äôm applying for a job at Staples.

**DUMPLING**
But you said you‚Äôd be here forever‚Ä¶

**NICK**
That was before Spit installed a flamethrower in the toilet.

**SPIT** (defensive)
It was for emergencies!!

---

## **ACT TWO**

**EXT. COMMUNITY GARDEN ‚Äî DAY**
The team arrives in full costume. Captain Protect is wearing a spaghetti strainer on his head. Cannoli has war paint made from frosting. Tidbit is wearing a ladybug backpack and tears.

**SPIT**
I brought bait.
(holds up a single Cheeto)

**DUMPLING**
Is it gluten free?

**CRUNCHING NOISE FROM THE BUSHES**
A squirrel, wearing a tiny beret, peeks out. More squirrels appear. One is holding a match. Another has a clipboard.

**GAZPACHO**
Too late. They‚Äôve formed a government.

**CAPTAIN PROTECT**
*Team, prepare for battle‚Äî*

**SPIT hits a button.** A net cannon goes off. Net hits Nick.

**NICK** (muffled, on ground)
WHY AM I EVEN HERE?!

---

## **ACT THREE**

**INT. HOUSE ‚Äî NIGHT**
Everyone‚Äôs back, tired and slightly singed. The squirrels now run the garden and have begun distributing pamphlets.

**TIDBIT**
I think we learned something today.

**SPIT**
Yeah. Don‚Äôt trust the one with the clipboard.

**HOT SAUCE**
Also, net cannons need more net. That one was... underwhelming.

**NICK** (dead inside, sipping wine from a measuring cup)
I hate all of you. I‚Äôm staying. But I hate all of you.

**DUMPLING** (smiling, handing him a blanket shaped like a taco)
Welcome home, Nick.

**RANDOM CRASH FROM UPSTAIRS**

**CANNOLI**
Oh no. The raccoon learned how to unlock the door again.

**SPIT**
You mean *Professor Meatsnacks*? He‚Äôs the mayor now.

**SMASH CUT TO BLACK.**

---

### **CREDITS ROLL OVER BLOOPERS:**

* Hot Sauce falling through a ceiling tile
* Captain Protect giving a ‚Äúhero speech‚Äù and getting pooped on by a bird mid-sentence
* Cannoli accidentally supergluing her own hand to a donut

Se there is this girl from my town that i had a thing for her since school( i already graduated, but she's still in school and yes we are both over 18). I've never actually talked to her, only saw that she follows me on instagram( she follows a lot of people so don't think its anything personal), but she's not that active on there I guess. I know where she works and my cousin who is in this school told me she doesn't have a boyfriend. The situation is I kinda like her and want to get to know her better, but don't know how. My friend said just text her whatever your heart desires and if she has interest you can ask her to grab a coffee or something after 2/3 days, if she doesn't have interest u simply forget about her. But really I don't know what to text her, or should I go to the shop she works in...

1l6hjga,https://i.redd.it/0762bfz1mq5f1.jpeg,Saw Dragon on Vijay TV today!!!,"Anupama's character arc in the movie is grossly misunderstood. She was compared to Trisha in Vidaamuyarchi which is totally baseless and unfair. Let me throw my 2 cents. In Vidaamuyarchi, it's a clear case of affair. The trauma of Trisha's miscarriage took a heavy toll on Ajith and he wanted some sort of catharsis and work served as means of escapism to his problems and pain. He found solace in those quiet, long, exhaustive hours of work where he got to be himself again and his mind wasn't lost. And that meant- it took away the one thing which anchored their relationship. The attention he gave to Trisha. She assumed that love wasn't there anymore and she attributed it and as most self- attritution bias victims do, blamed herself for it and the miscarriage. That was the start of the bubble. And the schism just kept widening until it cracked open and burst. That was the moment Trisha made up her mind to file for divorce and notified Ajith about Prakash and decided to move on. Now whether her relationship with Prakash was sexual or purely platonic is left to us (that would drastically change the whole dynamics of the confession thingy) but let's assume he was there for her during her tough times and comforted her, something that she expected from Ajith. Prakash filled his shoes and hence the realisation and confession. I also loved how Ajith accepts that it's too late to be worked out and acknowledges her honesty and gracefully accepts to move on and offers one last trip as closure. But their equation is a clear case of extra- marital affair. 

Coming to Dragon, her situation can be most closely compared to Divya in Lover. But Anupama isn't into adultery nor is she trying to cheat her husband. It wouldn't categorically fall under the umbrella of infidelity. Much like Divya who was enduring Arun's abuse for years out of sympathy for him and his mother, Anupama tries to stick around with Pradeep despite his carefree maverick nature. He isn't serious about life. And she's practical enough to understand that. She takes a decision that would be good for herself and hence the whole angle of ""guilt"" for abandoning him like that in the coffee shop out of a selfish decision. That's why she apologises. Pradeep also offers her closure in the end by saying that he wasn't a responsible son or a responsible BF and he was never grateful for all the things she did for him. Those were done out of pure love. So naturally once they broke up, they still had remnants of that relationship they carried in their hearts. You could part ways with your partner and still wish well for them and remain good friends. You don't need to be apathetic to their problems or develop angst or hate and ignore each other. That's not maturity. Pradeep and Anupama's situation was presented gracefully in this respect. Anupama tries to help fix him and he acknowledges her efforts (something which he failed to do back then). 

I am pretty sure she would have confided about this whole situation to her husband (that was left to us, open ended. So don't assume with limited information). And if her husband was not insecure and was open- minded, he would understand. You don't need to slut- shame your wife just because she's still hanging out with her ex. That's just regressive. Especially if there's nothing between them now and both are clear about it and transparent about it. She did say ""she's not happy in the marriage"" but we don't know if that situation changed after Pradeep offers her closure. Again, don't assume. 

Really appreciate Aswath Marimuthu for being mature with this whole writing of their dynamics.",8,1749403259.0,kollywood,10,0.72,False

Serbian Folklore Weekend: The Unholy Itinerary‚Ñ¢ 

Theme: ‚ÄúDark Mountains, Whispering Woods, and One Very Hot Couple Who Might Be Cursed.‚Äù 

üé¨ Films (and Screams)

1. Leptirica (The She-Butterfly) ‚Äì 1973 A classic Serbian vampire film with eerie forests, curses, and pure 70s horror energy. You will scream. I will hold you. The pit bulls will pretend to be unaffected.
2. Izbavitelj (The Rat Savior) ‚Äì 1976 (okay, it‚Äôs Croatian, but close enough) Creepy, dystopian, and full of weird rat-people metaphors. Very Slavic. Very what did I just watch?
3. Variola Vera ‚Äì 1982 More psychological horror/thriller with historical roots. Less folklore, more haunting realism. We can watch it with flickering candlelight for maximum spookiness.

üßÑüëª Serbian Folklore Weekend Menu Subtitle: ""Welcome to the Witch Hut, Would You Like Something Stuffed?"" üïØÔ∏èBreakfast (a.k.a. ""Brunch Before the Curse"") Pogaƒça ‚Äì Soft, warm, round bread pulled apart with your hands like the ancient ones did before gluten guilt existed. (You tear. I butter. The dogs beg.)

Kajmak + Pr≈°uta ‚Äì Spreadable heaven and paper-thin cured ham, basically what Balkan deities snack on during ghost meetings.

Black coffee so strong it could resurrect a vampire accidentally.

üåô Dinner (The Main Event of Darkness & Deliciousness)

 Sarma ‚Äì Cabbage leaves stuffed with meat, rice, herbs, and intention. This is a sacred dish. You don‚Äôt just eat sarma. You commune with it. 

Peƒçena Paprika sa Belim Lukom ‚Äì Roasted red peppers with garlic. Spicy. Smoky. Maybe slightly possessed. Paprika the dog may take this as a personal tribute. She‚Äôs fine with it. 

ƒåorba od peƒçuraka ‚Äì Creamy mushroom soup. Earthy, comforting, tastes like it was made by a witch who heals people but also hexes men who forget anniversaries.



Next weekend, Camp Blood Weekend. Friday the 13th!

Kiflice ‚Äì Flaky pastry rolls stuffed with cheese or jam. One batch sweet, one batch sinister. 

ü©∏ Drinks (Because hydration is sexy and maybe haunted) Rakija ‚Äì Always. You drink it before, during, and after everything. Including exorcisms.

I‚Äôm curious how you‚Äôd approach AeroPress brewing with this kind of coffee, especially without a grinder.

And more broadly, are there any general principles or small tweaks I should keep in mind when brewing with these kinds of grounds?

In Pasulka‚Äôs books, she mentions that Tim Taylor has protocols that he follows in order to establish connection with his intuition/psionic ability/whatever you want to call it.

In an interview with Greer, he mentions that ‚Äúdopaminergic drugs‚Äù were sometimes administered to psionic assets in order to enhance results in recovery missions.

It's called ""DCH"". People call it ""Don't Come Here"".  I've heard plenty of horror stories from other people but I'll just share the ones I've personally experienced. Years ago I went in for stomach pain. They told me it was gas and sent me home. Four hours later my appendix ruptured. Then there was the time I went in for leg/knee pain. The doctor said as a new patient I needed a breast exam. Having not slept in days and not being listened to, I started crying in frustration. He then told me I was depressed. I won't deny depression is something I've lived with for years. I know the difference between the whole depression body aches and hey there is something wrong here. A few years back my husband started experiencing stomach pain. Having gone through the same thing, I knew it was his appendix. Not one but two different doctors asked him if he was sure he wanted his appendix out! Nah, let it fester. I'm only writhing in pain over here...I'm sharing all this to say, I know I'm in an area where the doctors aren't the greatest. I feel like they expect you to know what to do just because you've been diagnosed with diabetes. When I was first diagnosed I had mentioned giving up coffee and other dietary changes. The doctor said, ""It's a little late for that now.""

 I was put on insulin last week. Every other time I pick up something from the pharmacy they ask if you have any questions. I had many, they didn't ask. I told the pharmacist I had questions. She gave me a blank look and said the doctor should have went over it with me. I get home and look at the insulin pens. Not being sent home with any needles I assumed the needle was in the pen and sat there for a few minutes like a dumbness trying to figure out how to use them. Then played phone tag with my doctors office for a week to get them to call in the needles for the insulin. 

 Supposed to meet with a doctor who only treats diabetes, however she won't be available until September. I guess what I'm asking for is anything that's helped others. Books, sites, anything because I'm completely lost at sea here.

What happens is it becomes unresponsive, the trackpad can‚Äôt be pressed down to click anything and the mouse doesn‚Äôt move at all.

Ever felt overwhelmed trying to build your LinkedIn network? You're not alone. I used to struggle with identifying key professional contacts and streamlining my connection process until I discovered this prompt chain.

This prompt chain is designed to guide you step-by-step through building a comprehensive LinkedIn networking strategy. It takes you from identifying potential connections, evaluating their profiles, crafting personalized messages, to analyzing the campaign's performance.


## The Prompt Chain

```
You are a LinkedIn networking strategist tasked with identifying key professional contacts. 

Task: Using the variables provided below, locate and list ideal LinkedIn connections.

Instructions:
1. Define the target industry by setting [TARGET INDUSTRY] to the industry you want to connect with.
2. Define the desired job role by setting [TARGET JOB TITLE] to the specific job title or role of interest.
3. Search LinkedIn for 15-20 professionals within the [TARGET INDUSTRY] who hold the position of [TARGET JOB TITLE].
4. Provide a list of these professionals, including their names and current job titles, if available.

Formatting: 
- Maintain a clear and structured format with bullet points for each identified professional.
- Ensure variable placeholders [TARGET INDUSTRY] and [TARGET JOB TITLE] are replaced with user-provided values prior to starting the search.

Output Example:
- Name: [Professional Name], Title: [Professional's Job Title]
- Name: [Professional Name], Title: [Professional's Job Title]

This prompt is the first in a chain of 8 prompts designed to build a comprehensive networking strategy.
~
You are a LinkedIn networking strategist responsible for advancing our professional connection strategy. Your task is to evaluate the profiles of each potential connection identified in the previous step. For each profile, follow these steps:

1. Analyze Professional Experience: Review their work history to understand the depth and relevance of their expertise.
2. Assess Interests: Identify key interests and engagements, such as shared professional interests, contributions, or topics they discuss publicly.
3. Evaluate Mutual Benefits: Determine potential mutual advantages for connecting (e.g., complementary skills, industry insights, collaboration opportunities).
4. Extra Insights (if available): Note any additional complementary qualities such as recent posts or participation in meaningful discussions that reinforce a potential connection.

Formatting Instructions:
- Present your evaluation as bullet points for each profile, including the individual‚Äôs name, current title, and a concise summary of your findings.

This clear, step-by-step assessment will help us prioritize and strengthen our LinkedIn connection strategy.
~
You are a LinkedIn networking strategist responsible for forging meaningful professional connections. Your task is to draft personalized connection requests for each potential contact identified earlier. Follow these steps:

1. Review the evaluated profiles of potential connections to identify shared interests, goals, or experiences related to the chosen industry.
2. Craft a concise and engaging message for each connection. Each message should:
   - Begin with a personalized greeting using the recipient's name.
   - Mention a shared interest or goal that ties into their experience within the target industry (replace [TARGET INDUSTRY] with the actual industry).
   - Clearly state why connecting could be mutually beneficial.
   - Maintain a friendly, professional tone that encourages further dialogue.

- Ensure clarity and brevity in each message, keeping each under 150 words.

2. Monitoring and Follow-Up:
   - Track and monitor the responses from the recipients.
   - Record acceptance rates and note any discrepancies or patterns in responses.
   - Be prepared to adjust your approach if you notice lower acceptance rates or unexpected responses.

Formatting Instructions:
   - Provide a status update list that includes each recipient's name, the date the connection request was sent, and the current response (Accepted, Pending, or Declined).
   - If applicable, include notes on any follow-up actions needed.

This clear, structured approach will ensure efficient execution and monitoring of your connection strategy.
~
You are a LinkedIn Networking Specialist tasked with deepening professional relationships after a connection request has been accepted. Your objective is to send a personalized follow-up message to each new connection in order to express gratitude and propose a brief virtual coffee chat or a topic discussion that directly connects with their professional expertise.

1. Identify Connections: Review the list of contacts who have accepted your connection request.
2. Compose a Follow-Up Message for Each Connection:
   - Begin with a personalized greeting addressing them by name.
   - Express your sincere gratitude for accepting the connection request.
   - Introduce a suggestion for a brief virtual coffee chat or propose a specific discussion on a topic that aligns with their area of expertise or interests.
   - Maintain a warm, professional tone and ensure the message is concise (preferably under 150 words).
3. Delivery and Tracking:
   - Send the crafted follow-up message to each new connection.
   - Optionally, record the date of the follow-up for future reference.

Formatting Instructions:
- Use bullet points or numbered lists to structure your follow-up messages if documenting multiple messages.

This structured approach will help build on the initial connection by fostering conversations that can lead to collaboration and mutually beneficial professional relationships.
~
You are a LinkedIn Networking Analyst responsible for measuring the effectiveness of our recent connection campaign. Your task is to analyze the outcomes after a two-week period. Follow these steps:

1. Review Data:

2. Identify Opportunities:
   - Document any referrals received.
   - Note any potential opportunities such as collaborations, job leads, or business opportunities that have emerged from these new interactions.

3. Reporting:
   - Summarize your findings in a structured report using bullet points or a table. Include key metrics such as total connections made, acceptance rate percentage, and any significant outcomes identified.
   - Provide concise insights and recommendations for optimizing future connection strategies.

This detailed analysis will ensure we understand the effectiveness of our LinkedIn outreach and guide adjustments for future efforts.
~

   ‚Ä¢ Initiating periodic check-ins or virtual meet-ups

The USS Voyager finally returned home after seven years in the Delta Quadrant. Simultaneously with its arrival, the daughter of Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres was born. Upon reaching Earth, the crew was immediately decorated and promoted. Kathryn Janeway was promoted to Admiral, Chakotay and Tuvok became Captains, Tom Paris a Commander, and Harry Kim a Lieutenant Commander. B'Elanna Torres was made Commander as well ‚Äî but due to her Maquis past, this was met with considerable reluctance from many (despite Chakotay once having held a Starfleet command himself). Yet the Doctor and Seven of Nine received‚Ä¶ nothing?

Seven of Nine faced difficulties being accepted into Starfleet. Janeway advocated for her and even threatened to resign in protest. In order to prevent Janeway from following through, Seven ultimately chose not to join Starfleet. Instead, much to Janeway‚Äôs disappointment, she joined the Fenris Rangers.

The Doctor fought for his rights. He succeeded in obtaining legal personhood ‚Äî but only as an exception, meaning other holograms remained without rights. The Doctor found this unacceptable and continued fighting for his kind. He served under Admiral Janeway, first aboard the USS Douglas, then aboard the USS Voyager-A.

Chakotay decided to return to the Delta Quadrant aboard the USS Protostar, a prototype warp vessel. Something went wrong, and he became stranded. While only a year passed for Janeway, a full decade passed for Chakotay, spent mostly in solitude (see Star Trek: Prodigy). His first command ended in tragedy: the death of his entire crew, including his first officer Adreeks. Eventually, he managed to return. He was appointed Captain of the Voyager-A, and Janeway retired.

Seemingly out of nowhere, Mars was attacked ‚Äî by androids. Janeway was recalled to active duty. An android ban was enacted, which struck the Doctor like a death blow. He feared for his deactivation. The Federation even considered disabling emotional subroutines in holograms.

Five years later, B'Elanna still felt unaccepted. She was deeply dissatisfied with the Federation‚Äôs handling of former Maquis members. Diplomatic relations between the Federation and Cardassia continued to improve ‚Äî something B'Elanna could not comprehend. She left Starfleet. Her daughter, still a child, was declared the Klingon Messiah. But B'Elanna wanted no part in it. She feared that her child would face the same prejudice she did ‚Äî anti-Klingon racism. To protect her from the madness, B'Elanna founded a new Maquis movement. Tom could not understand this at all, believing she was throwing everything away. They separated, and B'Elanna left with their daughter.

Tom discussed the situation with Kim, though Kim was of little help (""You‚Äôre asking me for advice about women?""). Many former Maquis joined B'Elanna. Feeling insecure about his place in the Federation, the Doctor followed her as well ‚Äî becoming a mentor to her. Unlike the old Maquis, the new movement was no longer just a resistance group; it became a kind of second Federation. They settled on former Cardassian worlds and steadily expanded to new ones. B'Elanna served as their President.

The Doctor conducted a rescue mission for Emergency Medical Holograms (EMHs). He bypassed the Federation‚Äôs security grid and transferred all EMHs onto a mobile data core. However, he could not save all holograms from Federation control.

The Maquis continued to expand in secret. For nearly ten years, the Federation remained unaware of them. Gradually, tensions developed between them and both the Federation and Cardassia. Janeway acted as a diplomat.

Eventually, the android ban was lifted, leaving the Doctor torn. Should he return to the Federation and fight for holographic rights? Or remain with the Maquis, where he was fully accepted? For the time being, he chose to stay.

Seven of Nine joined Starfleet and became a Captain. Tuvok returned to Vulcan to undergo therapy for a neurodegenerative disorder. A mind meld with a family member would have sufficed to heal him ‚Äî but his family perished in a warp drive accident while traveling to welcome him home.

The Federation initiated the first step toward an alliance with the Cardassians. The Maquis ‚Äî many of whom were Bajorans ‚Äî sabotaged the negotiations, killing one of the most important Cardassian diplomats. They framed the Federation for the attack. Many Klingons, who did not believe in B'Elanna‚Äôs daughter, and Romulans hostile to the Federation, joined the Maquis. B'Elanna resigned from the presidency, and a new leader was elected. The new President declared war on the Federation, the Klingons, the Romulans, and the Cardassians.

B'Elanna regretted ever founding the Maquis. During the war, a grand alliance formed: Federation, Klingons, Romulans, and Cardassians. Kim's ship was attacked and crash-landed. The ship was destroyed; Captain Kim was the sole survivor. He sent a distress signal, which was received by Admiral Chakotay. To reach the planet, Chakotay had to cross Maquis territory. He knew rescuing Kim might cost him his crew again ‚Äî but he decided to go through with it. He fought against the Maquis, including an old friend (""You new Maquis only stain the legacy of the old!""). Chakotay defeated them and rescued Kim.

B'Elanna's daughter willingly accepted the role of Klingon Messiah. All Klingons loyal to her withdrew from the conflict. B'Elanna fled to Qo'noS, feeling the war was no longer hers ‚Äî it had become something far greater.

Something was amiss in the war, and Janeway began to investigate unofficially. She discovered that the Cardassians intended to eradicate the Maquis and use that to secure peace with the Federation, the Klingons, and the Romulans. Janeway traveled to B'Elanna, and from Qo'noS they transmitted a message revealing the truth. The war ended. A revolution followed. The Maquis were nearly destroyed.

Picard traveled to Cardassia and declared that peace could be achieved differently ‚Äî not through manipulation, but through compassion.

After speaking with Chakotay, B'Elanna decided to remain on Qo'noS, which was now ruled by her daughter. Paris disapproved. The Doctor returned to Earth and continued to fight for his kind. Janeway finally entered her well-earned retirement.

Season 2:

Thanks to a new transwarp tunnel, Neelix and his family visited Earth. There, he was warmly welcomed by everyone‚Äîexcept for B'Elanna and Tuvok. He was deeply moved by the reception. He also reunited with Commander Naomi Wildman. He expressed his regret to Paris about B'Elanna. Together with Admiral Janeway, he boarded a passenger vessel and toured the old Voyager. He informed her of a new power that had arisen across the Delta Quadrant: the Kazon Empire. They had seized the remaining unclaimed transwarp tunnels and, through the reconstruction of new ones, had reestablished the Borg‚Äôs transwarp network. Janeway was stunned. The Kazon were now cruel, intelligent, powerful, and unified‚Äîall because Janeway had failed to eliminate their chaos. Janeway had no plan.

Neelix visited Tuvok on Vulcan. Tuvok was suffering severely from his neurodegenerative illness. He no longer even recognized Neelix. Neelix took care of him.

Janeway pondered what to do. Suddenly, Q appeared and reproached her for having destroyed the order of the Delta Quadrant. Janeway proposed destroying all transwarp tunnels using a subspace signal. But first, she did not know the correct frequency, and second, she would need to deploy at least three signal amplifiers across the entire Delta Quadrant. Even with protowarp, Starfleet ships were too slow. Janeway went to Starfleet Command to discuss the situation. Command responded that, with the current state of technology, the mission was impossible. However, action had to be taken now, as the Kazon could pose a threat to the Federation as well.

Back home, Janeway was having a cup of black coffee with Chakotay when she was suddenly teleported away. She found herself, along with the entire original Voyager bridge crew, aboard a modified but original version of the Voyager. All were bewildered. There was tension between Tom and B'Elanna. They tried to stay calm. When Kim checked their coordinates, he found they were 75,000 light-years from Earth. Janeway cried out: ‚ÄúQ!‚Äù He appeared, and Janeway demanded to know why he had done this. Q denied involvement and claimed not to know who was responsible. Since Admiral Janeway had altered the timeline, the future was now shrouded in mist even for Q.

The crew examined the ship. It was fully operational and equipped with many new devices. In the storage room, they discovered three subspace signal amplifiers. Janeway explained to the crew what needed to be done. Chakotay argued with Janeway, accusing her of blindly trusting luck. The Doctor treated Tuvok in sickbay.

Suddenly, Voyager came under attack‚Äîby the Kazon. Voyager‚Äôs shields dropped to 40% within seconds. They managed to escape. The crew was shaken. In Astrometrics, Seven located the nearest subspace relay station. They traveled there and scanned it‚Äîonly one lifeform was present: a Kazon. Chakotay insisted Janeway remain aboard Voyager. She refused, as they held equal rank. Janeway, Torres, and Kim beamed aboard the station. There, they encountered Cullah. Cullah explained that the Kazon were no longer themselves. He agreed to help on the condition that they take him with them. They accepted and placed the amplifier on the station, securing it with an impenetrable force field.

They were uncertain about their next steps‚Äîand whether Cullah would betray them. They needed resources. They initiated first contact with a telepathic species and negotiated for resources. One of the aliens noticed Tuvok‚Äôs neurodegenerative disease and claimed to have a cure. Under the Doctor‚Äôs supervision, he performed a neuroregenerative therapy. It succeeded. Tuvok regained his memory‚Äîbut lost control of his emotions. He showed great joy and even embraced Neelix.

Voyager was attacked again by the Kazon, and the Doctor was kidnapped. He was forced to treat numerous Kazon‚Äîwhich he did‚Äîand in the process, he learned much about the empire‚Äôs hierarchy. Voyager was destroyed during the rescue mission. Q, who was still aboard, placed the ship in a time loop, with only Janeway aware of it. She repeatedly tried to rescue the Doctor and save the ship, but each time, the mission failed or the ship was destroyed.

Wesley Crusher suddenly appeared, annoyed by Q, and declared that Q was responsible for Voyager‚Äôs destruction. Together, they rescued the Doctor‚Äîthis time without Voyager being destroyed. Wesley revealed that he had brought them to the Delta Quadrant because the Kazon Empire had never been foreseen.

Wesley teleported Voyager 30,000 light-years closer to home. One more amplifier needed to be placed‚Äîbut there were no more relay stations nearby, which surprised Wesley. They had to build a small one. While doing so, Tom and B‚ÄôElanna grew closer again. Suddenly, they were attacked by a Hirogen. They destroyed his ship. The station was completed, and Wesley installed the amplifier. Q watched him and the two exchanged words filled with disdain.

Wesley teleported them another 25,000 light-years forward, where they encountered Borg‚ÄîAgnes' Borg. Seven and Agnes reunited. They planned to place the amplifier on the Borg station, when suddenly the Kazon appeared. They attacked and kidnapped B‚ÄôElanna and Janeway. The two were brought before the Emperor and sentenced to death. Tom, Tuvok, and Neelix led a rescue operation. In the end, B‚ÄôElanna and Tom kissed. When Neelix nearly died, Tuvok was overwhelmed by emotion.

They returned to Voyager, which was still under fire, now protected by the Borg. Wesley and Kim installed the amplifier. Tuvok and B‚ÄôElanna beamed onto a Kazon ship, and Torres successfully identified the signal frequency. Janeway received it and transmitted the signal. All transwarp tunnels were destroyed.

Wesley attempted to bring them home, but he lacked energy. Recharging Wesley‚Äôs powers would take time‚Äîbut Q was still there. They had to persuade him to send them home. He and Janeway spoke‚Äîone final time. He expressed his admiration for her. Q teleported them home.

Janeway and Chakotay were back in her home, drinking black coffee. Chakotay apologized and declared his love for her. The crew reunited at Tom and B‚ÄôElanna‚Äôs second wedding. Seven has Raffy as her companion.

Anyone with a conscience can see the system is broken at a glance. It‚Äôs not just flawed ‚Äî it‚Äôs

designed that way. Built to keep people down, to preserve power for the few at the expense of

the many. The same system that justified slavery, that violates human rights across borders, that

bombs entire communities in the name of politics. The same system that allows billionaires to

influence elections, even if it means electing leaders they admit are dangerous. This is a system

built by people devoid of empathy.

But we ‚Äî the new generation ‚Äî are different. We see through the lies. We grew up online,

aware, informed, and connected. We‚Äôre not just angry ‚Äî we‚Äôre organized. We‚Äôre the generation

that boycotts Starbucks for union-busting. That canceled Balenciaga for exploiting children. That

pushed for accountability from Nestl√©, Shein, Amazon. We use our voices, our platforms, and

our wallets. And most of all, we care.

I know this because I‚Äôm one of us. I came from an underserved community ‚Äî where healthcare

was a privilege, not a right. Where opportunities were rare, and survival often took priority over

dreams rendering the same dreams to feel like privileges. But I was one of the lucky ones. I

studied medicine, and I‚Äôm on the path to becoming a surgeon. But I‚Äôm not doing this for money,

cars, or prestige. I‚Äôm doing it so the next kid like me has a shot ‚Äî not because someone gave

him charity, but because someone built a system that didn‚Äôt leave him behind.

That‚Äôs why I want to launch something bigger than a hospital. A movement. A new kind of

economy where people come before profit. Picture a luxury hospital: sleek, advanced, offering

top-tier plastic surgery, dermatology, and wellness. But instead of profits going to shareholders,

every dollar earned goes toward free or low-cost clinics in underserved communities. The

wealthy still get the care they want ‚Äî but the money they pay directly funds access for those

who can‚Äôt afford basic care. And this model can scale.

What if we did the same in food? In housing? In education?

Sector For-Profit Arm Subsidiary Arm

Food High-end restaurants, meal

kits

Community kitchens, free meal delivery

Housing Luxury developments Subsidized housing cooperatives

Education Private schools, test prep Free tutoring, literacy programs

Every coffee bought, every meal eaten, every luxury good purchased could become an act of

impact. We don‚Äôt need to dismantle capitalism. We need to redirect it ‚Äî reprogram it ‚Äî to serve

the many, not just the few.

Look at the world today. Africa, rich in natural resources, continues to be exploited ‚Äî its people

left in poverty while foreign companies extract billions. Workers in factories are paid pennies to

feed corporate greed. Pharmaceutical giants hoard patents while children die from preventable

diseases. Every part of our economy has been warped by a profit-first mentality. And the worst

part? People feel powerless.

But this model gives power back. It turns every purchase into a vote. A vote for justice. A vote

for equity. A vote for hope. When you get a latte, you‚Äôre helping a child get vaccinated. When

you buy a dress, you‚Äôre funding a free mental health clinic. When you get a facial, you‚Äôre

keeping someone alive.

And we‚Äôve already seen it work. MrBeast has built a massive platform not by selling out ‚Äî but

by giving back. His philanthropy videos, from building wells in Africa to restoring eyesight for the

blind, go viral not because they‚Äôre flashy, but because they resonate with our collective desire to

do good. Brands like TOMS, Warby Parker, and Ben & Jerry‚Äôs have proven that purpose-driven

business models can scale ‚Äî and succeed ‚Äî because this generation welcomes them.

It‚Äôs more than shopping ‚Äî it‚Äôs purpose. A reason to live and contribute meaningfully. Even if you

never meet the person you‚Äôre helping, you‚Äôll know your choices matter. Whoever you are ‚Äî a

student, a CEO, a retiree ‚Äî you‚Äôll be able to say: I helped build a better world",1,1749400650.0,DeepThoughts,6,0.6,False

1l6gd9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1l6gd9b/my_first_triathlon_from_herniated_disc_olympic/,My first triathlon! From herniated disc > olympic distance tri,"Just completed the Olympic distance at the RJA Memorial Mighty Montauk Triathlon yesterday.

**TL;DR:** Really messed up the swim, had a strong bike, solid run, and the best day ever.

# How I Got Here

On Thanksgiving morning 2024, I was warming up squats when I made a huge mistake‚Ä¶I turned to look at someone who was distracting me and threw out my back. The doc suspected an L4/L5 herniated disc, and I found myself out of the gym and in physical therapy for the next 8 weeks.

I read that swimming was good for herniated discs, and found myself at the pool shortly after. Being the competitive person I am, I felt like I needed to train for something to stay motivated. So naturally, I signed up for a triathlon.

# Training

I used Phil Mosley's 24-week Beginner Olympic Triathlon program, mainly for the swimming guidance. I also wanted something lighter touch since I was in the midst of planning my wedding plus a stressful period at work.

**Typical week:** 2x swim, 2x bike, 2x run, 1x strength

* **Swimming training notes:** I grew up surfing and I'm comfortable in water, but triathlon swimming was a totally different beast. I loved the challenge and seeing weekly progress. I'm proud that I improved my 400-yard time by over a minute: from 8:33 (January 24) to 7:25 (May 22). I did two open-water swims pre-race and panicked both times. I was too preoccupied with being afraid of what was beneath me to practice spotting (this is important later).
* **Cycling training notes:** My partner wasn't convinced about having a bike trainer in our apartment, so all my rides from January to May were on gym spin bikes. Once the weather in NYC improved, I grabbed my bike from storage and did a lot of loops in Central Park.
* **Running training notes:** I left a lot on the table with run training. I should have done more speed work and longer runs, but running became an afterthought this cycle.

# Pre-Race Goals

* **Swim (1 mile):** Under 35 minutes ‚ùå
* **Bike (20 miles):** Under 1:05 ‚úÖ
* **Run (10K):** Under 50 minutes ‚ùå

# Race Day Morning

Woke up at 4:15 for coffee. Toast for breakfast. Got to transition around 6am and grabbed a solid spot at the end of a row close to bike in/out.

# The Race

# Swim - 1 Mile

This was the discipline I was most worried about. ""What if I couldn't swim the entire mile?!"" Turns out I can swim much longer than a mile...

All women were in the same wave. I positioned myself toward the right and back to avoid the chaos. Things went well for maybe 200 yards until I started panicking. My mind spiraled: ""What have I signed up for? Why am I doing this? This isn't fun. Can I quit now?""

I obviously kept swimming, though. Thankfully, I relaxed and got into a groove. So much of a groove that I kept forgetting to spot. This wasn't problematic until people from the first wave were coming back and I found myself swimming toward them. I made a beeline to the right to avoid collisions.

Here's where things went wrong: I somehow got turned around. I found another woman who was also lost. She told me we should be going the other way. We were actually supposed to go the opposite direction (where I was originally headed). I realized our mistake and had to turn back to find the buoy where I was supposed to turn for my return to the beach.

I ended up swimming over 2,100 yards instead of the planned 1,750.

**Swim Time:** 42:49

# T1

I wasn't prepared for the disorientation coming out of the water. I've read about it so many times on this subreddit, but wow. I was dizzy and nauseous running to transition. Got my cycling cleats, race belt, and helmet on and headed out for my favorite part.

# Bike - 20 Miles

Since I knew my swim killed any age group podium chances, I went into the bike ready to enjoy a ride in Montauk. The route goes to Montauk Lighthouse, where my partner proposed, so that felt really special.

I played to my strengths. I'm a strong climber, so I used the hills to ""go fishing"" and pass people. Still didn't know what to expect with the run, so I stayed conservative otherwise.

**Nutrition:** Maurten gel at the start, plus sipped a bottle of Maurten 160 drink mix and another bottle of plain water throughout.

**Bike Time:** 1:02:48

# T2

Nothing notable except I couldn't turn off my bike computer. My partner has a video of me trying, getting frustrated, and saying ""f\*\*\* it"" before taking off.

# Run - 10K

I was shocked by how good I felt for the first 3 miles. I was relaxed and running much quicker than expected while actively holding myself back because I generally suck at pacing in normal running races.

At mile 3, the hills started and I really felt it in my hip flexors. Since I knew I wasn't having a competitive race, I focused on enjoying myself and encouraging others. There were lots of other encouraging girlies out there who I loved interacting with.

I played it way too safe on the run. Lesson learned for next time to push a little harder.

**Run Time:** 52:40

# Final Thoughts

All in all, I had the best day ever. I wish I hadn't messed up the swim so badly, but I don't know if I would have enjoyed the bike and run as much if I'd been in a ""racing"" headspace out of the water.

I'm revved up to do it again. Looking at ToughMan Westchester next (and taking recs for others to consider).

designed that way. Built to keep people down, to preserve power for the few at the expense of

the many. The same system that justified slavery, that violates human rights across borders, that

bombs entire communities in the name of politics. The same system that allows billionaires to

influence elections, even if it means electing leaders they admit are dangerous. This is a system

built by people devoid of empathy.

But we the new generation are different. We see through the lies. We grew up online,

aware, informed, and connected. We‚Äôre not just angry  we‚Äôre organized. We‚Äôre the generation

that boycotts Starbucks for union-busting. That canceled Balenciaga for exploiting children. That

pushed for accountability from Nestl√©, Shein, Amazon. We use our voices, our platforms, and

our wallets. And most of all, we care.

I know this because I‚Äôm one of us. I came from an underserved community  where healthcare

was a privilege, not a right. Where opportunities were rare, and survival often took priority over

dreams rendering the same dreams to feel like privileges. But I was one of the lucky ones. I

studied medicine, and I‚Äôm on the path to becoming a surgeon. But I‚Äôm not doing this for money,

cars, or prestige. I‚Äôm doing it so the next kid like me has a shot  not because someone gave

him charity, but because someone built a system that didn‚Äôt leave him behind.

That‚Äôs why I want to launch something bigger than a hospital. A movement. A new kind of

economy where people come before profit. Picture a luxury hospital: sleek, advanced, offering

top-tier plastic surgery, dermatology, and wellness. But instead of profits going to shareholders,

every dollar earned goes toward free or low-cost clinics in underserved communities. The

wealthy still get the care they want  but the money they pay directly funds access for those

who can‚Äôt afford basic care. And this model can scale.

What if we did the same in food? In housing? In education?

Sector For-Profit Arm Subsidiary Arm

Food High-end restaurants, meal

kits

Community kitchens, free meal delivery

Housing Luxury developments Subsidized housing cooperatives

Education Private schools, test prep Free tutoring, literacy programs

Every coffee bought, every meal eaten, every luxury good purchased could become an act of

impact. We don‚Äôt need to dismantle capitalism. We need to redirect it  reprogram it  to serve

the many, not just the few.

Look at the world today. Africa, rich in natural resources, continues to be exploited  its people

left in poverty while foreign companies extract billions. Workers in factories are paid pennies to

feed corporate greed. Pharmaceutical giants hoard patents while children die from preventable

diseases. Every part of our economy has been warped by a profit-first mentality. And the worst

part? People feel powerless.

But this model gives power back. It turns every purchase into a vote. A vote for justice. A vote

for equity. A vote for hope. When you get a latte, you‚Äôre helping a child get vaccinated. When

you buy a dress, you‚Äôre funding a free mental health clinic. When you get a facial, you‚Äôre

keeping someone alive.

And we‚Äôve already seen it work. MrBeast has built a massive platform not by selling out  but

by giving back. His philanthropy videos, from building wells in Africa to restoring eyesight for the

blind, go viral not because they‚Äôre flashy, but because they resonate with our collective desire to

do good. Brands like TOMS, Warby Parker, and Ben & Jerry‚Äôs have proven that purpose-driven

business models can scale  and succeed because this generation welcomes them.

It‚Äôs more than shopping  it‚Äôs purpose. A reason to live and contribute meaningfully. Even if you

never meet the person you‚Äôre helping, you‚Äôll know your choices matter. Whoever you are  a

student, a CEO, a retiree  you‚Äôll be able to say: I helped build a better world.",0,1749400155.0,freewill,2,0.5,False

But he posted it publicly on FB naman siguro mahahanap niyo by using keywords. So here's the story:

OP said that they were a gay couple who went to that coffee shop in Tagaytay to have a peaceful & relaxing moment together. But instead of having that moment, they received comments from a staff na ""Sabi na nga barbie!"" & nung paalis raw sila, nag comment raw ulit ng ""Barbie nga ni"". 

If I were in their shoes, i'd feel so offended/disrespected. Imagine, hindi mo ka close yung staffs. Hindi mo sila kilala ni 1% tapos ganon isasalubong sayo, eh gusto mo lang bumili sakanila. Random people lang sa isa't isa sila couple at staffs, tapos ganun sila sa customer? :( I think that's wrong naman. 

What's weird is, nag public apology raw yung cafe pero hindi naman raw pinoint out yung details and hindi raw directly nag apologize sakanila. Wala rin raw nag reach out sakanila. some friends were defending the couple & speaking up sa comment section kaso dinedelete raw ng Tom N Toms Tagaytay yung mga comments. And then may mga replies from suspicious profiles na mukhang bahong gawa. Some of the comments were dismissive raw and mocking. 

I hope Tom N Toms Tagaytay hire staffs na hindi ganun ka disrespectful sa mga tao. What if hindi lang pala sila sa couple na yun naging ganon? Nagkataon lang na narinig nila OP. What if meron pa silang ibang taong ginaganon kahit di part ng LGBTQ+? The couple were nice pa nga to step out nalang calmly. Kaso nakarinig pa sila ng ""Barbie nga ni"" nung palabas. Still nice kasi nagtimpi sila. HAHAHA kagigil.

ikik yall are looking for it , I was looking for it too last year, tired of not getting proper videos and limited information. I am sorry that I am late but will do my best to give each detail so this will be long but this is newest post and talks of last year so u can trust. if you are scared or excited after reading the stuff it's ur reaction not my responsibility. 

you get into the hostel parents aren't allowed at all after that biometric gate. the maids will carry your stuff to your room.  KEYS the lock yep it might not work well and might get struck (I got locked on my first day). everything dusty lucky you'll get a newspaper in ur almira/cupboard. no rack to hang clothes - buy with contri with roomies in common room.  OR I brought chandelier type and hang from the curtain rod. ATTENDENCE at 9PM (9-9:30) you sign downstairs happens everyday. BRING pillow and Bucket pls nothing is cheap here. this is a trap. AND meds they DON'T keep basic meds at all not even glucose. Extension broad too pls bring. The major problem I faced was the induction and microwave or an cooking thing. firstly it's all the way on ground floor yeah if u on 8th floor all the way ground and no water till 3rd floor. drinking water on 3,6 maybe at 8th. so you carry all your things downstairs and stand in line cus everybody wants to cook maggie and heatup the dinner they missed in H block mess. More sad - you can't use the induction until it's 6 PM so u no lunch u make no maggie. (had a breakdown a this point). that too timing after that can vary or be late according to warden's mood damn it. but yeah it's surely to use from 8PM to 12PM at midnight microwave, induction all in locked office. NO FOOD DELIVERY - I'll tell u the catch but just know food delivery ain't allowed but blinkit is (which also keeps on banning according to shadow's \*wink\* mood). be careful mostly blinkit is and u can get raw stuff. (advice don't boil potato on induction not work microwave 8 mins, egg no microwave tho)  also don't fry non veg Fish or meat. smell is strong warden angry. egg fry ok. steel works on induction too , no micro. CATCH- get outpass on weekend(SAT / SUN) go outside and get ur food delivery come back no Qs asked no drama money worth. 2nd - get the number of nearby vendor they are allowed to food deliver inside like till gate. but they only snack.  Best one yet can be risky , app their food is allowed even the delivery man gets scared but he is allowed (if blinkit is allowed then they are too they ain't related) the food can be hit or miss sometimes but find a hit stick to that don't experiment there or  money lost. app name - Eatclub. (don't do the thali, bowls good) . Inside campus you'll find only eggs as non veg. don't look inside them washing dishes. D block - only spice , H block - no flavour. Amul ice cream from amul shop not good buy from corner of H block. Mamamia near Amul for fancy days good momo good noodles good. on the lower ground E block Mega bit portion too much so split. D block breakfast pasta good H block not good.  for mega bit download Smart Q and order from there.  

OUTPASS

nothing complicated on amizone, hostel, you get option of outpass , 2 types - day one - from 9 AM - 7 PM if late nothing happens other than curse words . and if drunk then you dead. parents don't approve this but get notified. 

Night one - starts at 9am till next day no you can't do like 10PM that day , you have to stay the night out. earliest to come back is next day 7 AM. outpasses in both cases are given on weekends NOPE no Fridays maybe Friday night as night outpass if lucky. not even if you have holiday on Wednesday you won't (I did this on Christmas mine was cancelled breakdown pt 2 ) 

warden comes on random check twice a yr idk  but hide ur smokes/vapes (Ik u do), okay another catch thing if you get annoyed of going down for making. if u wanna risk it you can keep the hot pot but hide in suitcase all times . Also hairdryer IS allowed no need to hide that. they might have movie night but not worth it won't recommend if introvert. 

Guest House 

okay for parents if you walk forward on H block road you'll find this at the end of road . it's for your stay for 1 day - 2200. no foods included , rooms are too good. money worth. my mum and father stayed .  yeah students can hangout in their parent's room and take nap in afternoon.  but you gotta come back in by 9Pm in ur hostel. 

also the AC doesn't work from 7 or 8 AM till 6PM. it's bearable heat but still my friends always complained about that. i can't say much I am from poor family so I never complained for food or whatever cold air I got yeah. What I cried for was the warden's mood changes things and non-logical rules like induction timing and Only one induction for 8 floors.  students do create mess but still having more water cooler and cooking appliances are kinda necessity. 

there's swimming . making card takes time but if u know to swim I'll recommend going , u go I block fill form getting signed by HOI (Hard part) and you get card. badminton court always filled but ground space there. 

maids to clean are there  they stay from 10 AM to 6 PM but technically you can ask them before 5PM after that they disappear also around lunch they won't find them. 

Library is good until some seniors make that games place and date idea. they don't listen rules they so loud .  but yeah that's my hideout. oh no you won't find the cabins empty on weekdays. 

also Don't buy from CCD coffee too expensive and not worth. I bought and spend so much that I straved myself that day.  dosa plaza good but dosa there not good ironically. 

Water drinking one bad so keep the check, also they sometimes clean tank without warning so no water for day in bathroom . Water drinking is good there been incidents where yellow water .

Listen Ik people on videos will say oh this place nice and this and that but... those are my friends and ik they lied a lot of part and last yr I was struggling looking for somekind of review or person to ask and keeping that in mind I wrote this. it's long but I went over whatever details I could , ofc hostel is fun you make friends bitch about other friends host movie nights with roomies , bitch about warden and teachers like uncles or aunties , break bones (I didn't, friend did, learn about harmony , sharing and how many people no CIVIC sense . 

my suggestion if you are not from Delhi, Noida or the NCR I'll say stay in hostel strictly if u have no opinion too choose the hostel for now, reason is we know that place ain't safe and being new to city itself is so big and this is not the only thing you'll be doing , you be putting first online order on own address or making food or buying things more than chips and making decisions. Hostel will help you explore the city with a bit of safety like you have to know the place before you start making moves .  use the 1yr doing that. make friends gp split bills understand finances go outside to tourist or hidden gems.  also freshers get better view so enjoy that from the window. (I never had a room so... i was happy with whatever I got eventho I got angry over a lot of stuff till the end)

for any complaints 

if someone in my room the ac duct it used to leak and flooded my room in first week, rn the air wasn't blowing well so do complaining again. and sorry I couldn't leave u anything I moved out on an unplanned day.  for complain on amizone , suggestion box , complain you can file complaints with category wise. 

the clinic behind D block stays open till 7 PM max. u think it's fever get it checked don't call trouble. 

also any parents here - drugs and alcohol does happen here , personally haven't witnessed drugs but alcohol and smoke does happen so just cus Shadow says nothing happened, doesn't mean it won't. rules just get strict, but it hurt others cus they can't blinkit anything or sometimes become ridiculous banning Amazon or flipkart . kids will do it anyways. but trust ur kid if they strong they won't cus I didn't. 

if any questions, I will answer.  no I will not tell who am I nor met yall or act like senior for a certain department I won't. no Idk about placement heard people say it's good here. ",2,1749400051.0,amityuniversity,3,1.0,False

My stock E24 does ok, but it just seems like the temperature is slightly too low to make consistent steam. It is much better than my DeLonghi but not as good as higher end machines I've used in the past. I don't want anything else to change right now so I don't want to do another mod such as a PID or Gaggimate at this time. 

Thanks. ",0,1749399838.0,gaggiaclassic,4,0.5,False

I'm a F, 5'6.5 or 5'7, and I weighed 125 this morning. I started at 185 two years ago. In February of this year I got down to 117. At that point I was like ok, this is good, and I just wanted to maintain. 

Shortly afterwards, about two months ago,  I decided to make some life changes. Probably because I was finished losing weight so I needed a different goal, lol. I was skinny but I decided to work on other aspects of my health.

I finally quit vaping (!!!), I stopped taking hormonal birth control pills, and I went from no exercise at all to going to the gym and doing cardio 6 days a week. My job was already somewhat active, but I wanted to add some intentional exercise.

I think the biggest change that has contributed to my gain is my eating, of course. I used to skip meals. Ive started eating 3 meals a day now, sometimes more. I stopped drinking coffee and diet soda in addition to quitting nicotine and getting off of birth control, so as you can imagine my appetite has gone through the roof. I eat very clean, but the quantity is much more now.

I initially put my scale away because I anticipated some weight gain and I wanted to focus on being healthier rather than the number. I was noticing changes in my clothes and in the mirror though, so I panicked and weighed myself. Yup, gained 8 pounds. 

I feel sad about it, and a bit ashamed/embarassed even? I feel like the chubby girl I was all the way back when I started. I was so depressed back then, I couldn't even look at my body in the mirror.
 
I lost the initial weight very quickly going from 185->135. It took me a bit more effort to go from 135->125. And then it took me MONTHS to go from 125 to 117. It was super hard. And within a few weeks of eating more, I am right back up at 125. 

All those feelings aside, I am still proud of myself. I have made some huge difficult changes and I keep reminding myself that I am without a doubt healthier now.

I have way more energy, my mood is improved, I am sleeping well, my skin is clear, my hair is finally growing... And If I dont compare myself to skinnier photos, I still look pretty good.  

I am terrified of gaining more weight back and what that might look like, but I'm trying to trust the process that my weight will balance out and hopefully go back down a bit eventually.

I know this post is kind of about weight gain and not trying to lose, but this is a part of my overall journey and just thought I'd share and see if anyone can relate or has any thoughts to add",6,1749399800.0,loseit,6,0.87,False

I'm 25 and having a mini-quarter life crisis ü§£ Just recovering from withdrawing from the world due to a tough time with work, and now several of my close friends (who I have met at work) are moving away from Manchester. Realised outside work, I don't know other folk, especially those who share similar interests. Just that lingering feeling being lonely and struggling to make friends the older I get it seems. That may be because I'm quite a big introvert but I do enjoy the presence of others, you know, to have some ""go-tos"" to call up for adventures.

  
Tried friend apps, dating apps, meetup etc, but still haven‚Äôt really connected with anyone, Tried the Mcr Discord but it feels like everyone already have their inner circles so its hard to fit in. Later this month I'm hoping to join some sports groups, a bit nervous to try bouldering but need to get out of my comfort zone, same for badminton. I don't drink due to some meds but won't say no to a ""drink"" as long as you don't mind its a soft drink. Folk I meet at raves or out and about we exchange contacts but nothing really comes of it, I'm not in any rush but don't want to wait around idly hence the post.

  
And honestly I know as an introvert its hard to make friends and keep friends, but I was hoping there may be others out there who see this post as a signal to maybe come out of our comfort zones together? lets grab a coffee, play ping pong, go for a hike, for brunch, for a local rave or gig, chill non-verbal at a book cafe, be there at 3am when having a mini crisis about what we said to the waiter 3 years ago type deal. Dunno. Just so many things to do, just want people to do it with. Honestly I'm low-key even if my post comes across as the opposite, I'd prefer just doing side quests like running errands as a form of hanging out for me to be content. 

Either that, or if people have any suggestions on where to meet new folk, fellow introverts, queers, alts, neurodivergent and just good vibes. I'm not too far from central Mcr. Sometimes wish I capitalised on my uni times a bit more to make connections but here we are

I like all things music, crafts, walks / hikes, horror, dogs (and cats, and RATS).

i've made Manchester my home, and while there is so much to do, I'd rather share these experiences with ""my"" people. so hopefully this post brings out one or two people in a similar boat.

35M here from Chennai.
My social circle has shrunk over the years ‚Äî I have a bunch of school friends, but everyone‚Äôs tied up with work, family, and their own lives. Most of my time goes into work and family too. Since both my current and previous jobs were remote, Im not able to hangout as much with colleagues too. 

Lately, I‚Äôve really started missing the casual hangouts, conversations, and the sense of connection that used to come from friendships and daily interactions. But making new friends at this age feels‚Ä¶ tricky.

Is anyone else in a similar boat?
How do you stay socially active in your 30s and beyond?
Are there any groups, clubs, or meetups (especially in Chennai) that you'd recommend?
