1gnu7rb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gnu7rb,Watch this and read the comments. It literally sounds like they think the whole world is just there for them to take it,"I dont know why but im so fking angry after watching this and reading few comments.

Im 100% sure 90% of Muricans think that europe is made from 3rd world countries, actually i know that it is the case because these are normal guestions/sentences i got to hear while i was working in Minnesota for few months: 
Do you guys know what TV is? 
Must be hard living without electrisity.
Do you know how to use phones?
My favourite was ”Do you guys have cars?

They also think everything was invented/created by americans for example:
-Linux
-Internet
-cars
-saunas
 
and some funnier things i have heard SOME of them claim to be from Murica:

-Jesus Christ
-English language
-Pizza
-Noodles
-bmw the car brand (btw look up the bmw logo from WW2!!)

And one more thing i heard in Poland last summer:

Murican tourist in a cafe: What do you mean you do not accept US dollars?

Worker: Mam this is Poland..

Tourist: US dollar is the only real money

I did not hear anything else because i got my coffee and went outside to drink it

And after working out in a
gym they wanted to show me something that would blow my mind and it did, they showed me a ”sauna” (not a sauna in any way) ppl were just sitting in there with all their clothes on and temperature was something like 30 degrees. 

Sorry for the whole sauna rant but it hurt my soul as fingolian so mutch",2,1731218966.0,2nordic4you,3,1.0,False
1gnu7cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1gnu7cp/why_i_wish_i_was_deaf/,Why I wish I was deaf.,"I'm telling you, this is a very long and very complicated story. My music is Dynamic Threads, as is my username here. They will not let me post this elsewhere and you will get no TL;DR.

The story:

Back around 2010, there was a website which was one of the last remaining Vbulletin forums hanging around the internet. It was based out of/owned by someone in the UK. Thom Yorke was the name of a user on the forums, and the site administrator/owner (MusicMan) had confirmed that it was, in fact, actually Thom Yorke from Radiohead and not to bother him or he wouldn't post any longer and you would be banned for bothering him if you PM'd him.

Thom Yorke talked exactly like Thom Yorke. He had about 50-60 posts total on the forums, and he stopped in a few times a year at one point. 

Over the appx. 4 years I posted on that forum, I interacted with MusicMan via PM. I was one of the last remaining active members and I had a thread called ""Thread to generally express in a non-spoken manner"" where I would post stream-of-consciousness pieces at random, which he really enjoyed.

Over the course of a couple of years, I had posted my music to the forums and developed a rapport with MusicMan. He swore up and down that the Thom Yorke user was actually Thom Yorke. And maybe it was. But I started to suspect MusicMan himself of being Thom. Possibly Jonny. Maybe Stanley Donwood. Maybe someone else entirely.

See, I started to ask questions. And MusicMan had a post on the forum where he bragged about knowing Dave Friedmann (Producer for Flaming Lips, MGMT) and had been inside of Wayne Coyne's home as a guest several times.

MusicMan also described himself as having a distinguishable facial scar. Well. Aside from Seal, I don't know anyone else besides Thom Yorke (paralyzed eye at birth, surgically repaired, permanent lazy eye and surgery scar) with a well-known facial scar. I think Jonny has one or two from shaving? Maybe Richard Hawley because he had a cleft lip? But MusicMan didn't talk like Richard Hawley did in interviews. He's very fucking British that man.

MusicMan's speech and choice of words was pretty much verbatim with Thom Yorke's. I actually asked MusicMan to listen to my demos after talking to him for over a year. I had recorded them Winter of 2009/2010 between November-May. I had asked this somewhere around 2011-2012.

""I don't really do that kind of thing."" he responded. This is something that stood out to me, because when Radiohead performed on the Grammy's in 2009, there was a story that Miley Cyrus told. She went backstage to their dressing room and asked to meet them. Security guard went in, came back out, told her ""They don't really do that kind of thing"". I had asked this somewhere around 2011-2012.

Quick side note: In the summer of 2010, I had thrown my demo on stage at a Flaming Lips concert in Pittsburgh. Shortly thereafter, a woman named Fabiola Gatti and I had started talking on Facebook. We became pen pals. She told me she was a musician and model. I looked her up. She was dating the singer from MGMT, Andrew VanWyngarden. Seems odd that after throwing my demo on stage at a Lips concert, a woman who dates a musician who toured with, recorded with the Flaming Lips and their producer, Dave Friedmann, had befriended me online. Her band was called The Fabs, based in Scotland.  She was from Uruguay.

Anyway, back to MusicMan. I slightly pestered him to listen to my demos for a couple of weeks. He finally caved and said fine, but only because he loved my ""Thread to generally express in a non-spoken manner"" and that I needed to stop asking or he wouldn't listen. He told me to give him a few weeks, but warned me that he wasn't going to hold back on his critique of my music.

I said bring it on.

He PM'd me a few weeks later. And he absolutely went off on me. He called my demos ""The most unrefined, free-form and dissonant music he had ever heard"". He told me the vocals were too low, too layered within the landscape, too raw and emotional. He said there was very little song structure, no technique.

He never actually said they were bad, though. But he did accuse me of making music ""Just to get chicks"". Which was strange, because I was penpals with a prominent musician's girlfriend.

Fabiola was so nice. She really was. And it was 100% plutonic. I never hit on her or flirted with her, and we talked very regularly. She was really my only friend for a couple of dark years in my life. She was very supportive of me and my music, but suggested I go ""electronic"".

But, back to MusicMan. I had anticipated he would try to emasculate me in some way. But I told him he actually said everything I wanted to hear in relation to my music. I wanted it to be free form. I intentionally made it dissonant and unrefined. I purposefully didn't layer most of my vocals, nor did I use any reverb or effects. However, some of my demos contained up to 50 guitar layers. Some were just a single take. I wasn't interested in traditional song-structure. I was interested in ""through-composure"" where no part of a song repeats from start to finish.

He backed right off. He actually changed his tune and said well, if that's what I was going for, he understood but just didn't agree with it. We continued to talk for another year. I actually posted a review of King of Limbs where I tore it apart and called it not a pile of crap, but a finely polished turn rolled in glitter. He thought it was hilarious.

So, I finally asked him to meet. I asked him if he wanted to grab a cup of coffee sometime. Maybe in New York City.

He actually was receptive to the idea but he was curious: What did I intend on asking him? What advice was I seeking? What did I hope to gain from this meeting?

I said nothing. I just wanted to have a casual cup of coffee and then be on my way.

He was so utterly offended by that gesture that he basically stopped talking to me. Within the next year, activity on the forum was basically non-existent and he stopped hosting the domain.

Between 2010-2016, when I was active online and trying to form connections, I did brush shoulders with some other prominent people in the industry. 

Fabiola Gatti was 100% who she said she was. I even talked to her about a year ago and caught up really quick. She makes short films now in her home country and was as polite as ever. But around the same time I was talking to her and MusicMan regularly, basically all of 2012, Pitchfork magazine ran a promotion where readers could get an email published and a response with it. 

Well, I wrote a huge email, crazy right? And I talked about my musical awakening, teaching myself to play guitar, going to school for sound engineering, dropping out and recording me demos but being intimidated by the ""Pitchfork standard"" that they had set. I said ultimately, I stood by me recordings and provided a link within the email.

Weeks went by with no response. But finally, I had an email in my inbox. From Ryan Dombal. Senior Editor-in-chief of Pitchfork Magazine. It was a follow-up to my email. Was my email going to be published? Did I actually brush the right shoulder finally?

Nope. He said: ""Hello, this is Ryan Dombal. We received your email. I feel like you shouldn't let Pitchfork dictate which direction you take with your music. Thanks for the kind words.""

That was it. I was shocked. Why even respond? What an absolute slap in the face. That was his takeaway and response to my very elaborate and well-thought out email?

I could only suspect that an intern or low-level employee was tasked with sifting through the emails. Obviously mine had stood out. And been pushed all the way up to the second in command. A man who bragged about knowing ?uestlove and various other musicians whom he name-dropped in his reviews.

Thanks for the kind words? Yikes.

Over the next few years, I talked to some music journalists about Dombal. They basically told me he is a gate-keeper and no one in the industry actually like him, because he's smug like that. Well cool, at least I had some comfort on that front but still... 

The most prominent person to have followed my music was Emmet North Jr. He played guitar with Issac Hayes, Barry White, Chuck Berry.

During this time, my music was also buried on google search engines. Like. BURIED. It used to show up on the first page, top results... But three pages in and nothing. All the other search engines it was the first hit still. But the most popular? Nope, buried.

I have tried to talk to my peers, my friends, my family... No one supports me. No one believes me. They all tell me it's just a coincidence. A very weird coincidence. I became depressed, got involved in an abusive relationship where I was physically attacked and in one instance, this person broke my guitar playing wrist. She also dated a man who was an editor at Rolling Stone magazine. Yet another weird coincidence. 

I have had a very hard time recovering from the injury because I do a lot of physical labor for a living. I am a working-class man. With very little resources or support. I really put myself out there and a lot of people stomped me down.

Want a weird anecdote? After splitting with the abusive relationship, I met a woman from St. Catherine's, Ontario. She was a local artist who had some famous clients purchase some of her work, specifically name dropping The Weeknd. After talking to her for a while, somehow MGMT got brought up. I said I talked to his girlfriend back in the day... This woman said she had talked to Andrew, the singer form MGMT before they got their big break. She described him as ""Chubby and insecure"" and panicked when I mentioned my story and she said ""Well it's not like it was some big conspiracy to block you from the industry. Maybe the timing just wasn't right"" and got extremely weird about the whole situation and distanced herself.

I don't know man. I have been struggling for years. I have a lot of issues listening to music and promoting my own, because for some reason, no one will support of listen to it. And it's been buried on search engines.

 I knew what I was doing to my body for the 10 years I drank heavily, 99.9% of total days. It wasn't the 10+ urgent care visits initially, or getting caught at work. It wasn't the two OWI's (long time ago, no crashes or aggravating factors).

No, it wasn't the ruined relationships, it wasn't the times I said things i regretted...

It was, selfishly, being confronted by my own mortality with scarier and scarier blood work. It's not wanting to get another ultrasound of my liver. It's not wanting my family to lose me, and deal with the grief. It used to be fun to drink. Then I did it just to function. 

21 days sober, feeling much better. I can write without shaking all over the place. My eyes got brighter. I'm still not looking forward to the ultrasound. Drinking coffee, water, focusing on exercise b vitamins, electrolytes. I'm trying milk thistle, dandelion root, and NAC. Dr said that's OK! What helped me actually taper was urgent care,honesty, vulnerability, and medication. Librium helped, but gabapentin helped more. 

I guess I was browsing, and I wanted to throw it out there.. if it's becoming a health issue, stop while you can. Feeling like shit, and all the crap that comes with it isn't worth it. Don't go cold turkey if you have severe physical symptoms after a few hours of not drinking.

1gnto6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrannyWitch/comments/1gnto6y/everyday_energetic_practices_for_protection_and/,Everyday Energetic Practices for Protection and Well-being,"In times of personal or global turmoil, it's crucial to protect our energy and maintain our spiritual well-being. Here are some simple yet powerful practices I utilize in my practice and daily life:

Grounding and Protection:

*Walk Your Property: Circulate your property counterclockwise, visualizing a protective barrier of light. Declare, ""Nothing but love, light, laughter, and joy can stay. Anything negative, dark, and miserable must flee."" 

* Shield Yourself:Before leaving your safe space, visualize a protective shield around your body, deflecting negativity.

* Carry a Grounding Object: Keep a physical object like a crystal, stone, or feather to center yourself and reduce anxiety.

Cleansing and Renewal:

Cleansing your personal items and living space is a powerful practice to remove negative energy and create a harmonious environment. Here are some methods you can use:

*Smoke Cleansing Traditional Herbs/ Homemade Smudge /Saining Sticks

*Spray Cleansing:
Herbal Infusions /Crystalline Waters

*Sound Cleansing
Singing Bowls / Bells

*Salt Water Cleansing: (make sure the items you cleans can tolerate the salt) 
*Sunning and Mooning: Expose your items to sunlight or moonlight to cleanse and recharge them.

 Experiment with different methods to find what resonates with you best.

* Cleansing Baths: Use Epsom salt and herbs like lavender or rosemary to wash away negative energy.

* Protective Drinks: Infuse your tea or coffee with protective herbs like cinnamon or cloves, stirring counterclockwise to dispel negativity.

* Mindful Meditation:Practice daily meditation or guided visualizations to calm your mind and reduce stress. If you need guided mediation that is great too... I love Pura Rasa on YouTube! 

Connecting with Nature:

* Nature Therapy: Spend time outdoors, connecting with the Earth's energy. Let the wind clear your mind and the sun energize your spirit.

Intellectual and Spiritual Growth:

* Learning: Dedicate time to learning new things, whether through books, online courses, or workshops. Imagine if you use the next 4 years to learn something to benefit your craft rather than be on social media platforms.

** I'd be willing to share my knowledge about different topics and give my favorite learning resources. **

Protecting Your Energy:

* Emotional Mastery: Avoid giving power to negative emotions triggered by others. Maintain emotional detachment and focus on your own well-being. When you allow others to affect your emotions, you are giving them power over you. 

**Intention is Key:** Set your intentions before you perform any ritual.
**Ethical Sourcing:** Choose ethically sourced herbs (grow your own if possible) and crystals to ensure positive energy.

Remember, these practices are a personal journey. Adapt them to suit your unique needs and preferences. By incorporating these simple rituals into your daily life, you can strengthen your energy, shield yourself from negativity, and cultivate a more peaceful and fulfilling life. 

If there is any topic above that you'd like additional information feel free to ask in the comments or message me personally. 

What do you suggest to your fellow coven members to utilize in their daily practice or craft? Any practice(s) you use specifically for cleansing /protection?

1gntnf3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gntnf3,"Tightrope - One Paseo, Cebu City","**Tightrope**\
📍One Paseo, Paseo Saturnino, Cebu City\
🕕 7AM - 10PM

What we ordered:\
☕️ Filter: Archers UAE Hamasho Village, Anaerobic 96 hrs (₱240): this was brewed with a Kalita wave 155 tsubame copper dripper. Quite interesting as the last time I was here, they were using an Orea dripper. I asked the barista why it was so, and he said that it really depends on what the owner decides. 

According to the menu, the tasting notes of the coffee are mango, raspberry and pineapple, and you can smell them when the beans are ground and even after brewing. When the notes on beans indicate fruits, it would usually mean that the brewed coffee is bright and/or funky tastes and that is true with this brew: the coffee is juicy and light, a bit acidic. My best friend says she can taste the raspberries but I don’t know how that tastes like, so I’m assuming that the funky taste was that. The coffee is good in a way that you won’t need sugar to finish it. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

☕️ Himalayan Latte (₱190): Tightrope’s version of the seasalt latte. A good blend of espresso, cream, milk and salt. My best friend says that there’s a bit too much salt than she’d like, but your ghorl is himarat so we are letting that go. 😆 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\
🍵 Hibiscus Cold Brew (₱ 150): I’m not fond of tisanes, especially hibiscus (very bitter and astringent on its own), so I did not have high hopes for this. Unfortunately, the matcha latte was not available so we had this for the tea representative. Sweetener was used, but still not a fan of tisanes. ⭐️⭐️⭐️

🥪 Eton Mess Waffles (₱420): buckle up, rant incoming. Lami man siya, but.

The [Eton mess](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/eton_mess_97585/amp) has three elements: berries (usually strawberries), meringue and chantilly cream and I was quite excited to finally taste it ~~becuase it sometimes gets mentioned in Britain-based fics like Harry Potter and Bridgerton so yay! I can finally have a taste~~. I was a bit disappointed when the dish arrived and there were ❌no berries and ❌no meringue on the waffles. There’s cream, but that hardly defines the Eton mess, right? It’s like calling it Mango Float waffles fully expecting mangoes, graham crackers and cream, but the waffle only has cream and other fruits that are decidedly not mangoes. I was determined then to only give it three stars at most.

We dig in and it’s just _so_ good, I had to reconsider. The waffles have cream, an assortment of tropical fruits like kiwi and mangoes, bits of almonds, maple syrup and a strawberry jam for garnish (probably to still give it a semblance of the ‘Eton mess’). The waffles are so light and airy, it surprised me that waffles can have that texture since I’m so used to the dense and heavier versions of Danidoo and Belgian waffles. The cream is just the right level of sweetness and it blends really well with the fruit selection. Admittedly, I find it very sweet once the maple syrup comes in. It was a very tasteful experience.

I’m giving it 4 stars because I’m still reeling over the lack of meringue and berries. They should probably just name it ‘San Carlos mess’ because the kiwi and mangoes would be a good representation of the school’s color palette. 😆 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

🥪 Tri Mushroom Toast (₱420): the biggest surprise for me. It’s sourdough topped with (what we think is) Greek yogurt with cheese (the menu says feta cheese) and a very generous assortment of mushrooms. My best friend and sister say that there are enoki, shiitake and button mushrooms, and one big chink of a portabello mushroom (_gasp!_ Mao di ay mahal hahahaha). I don’t like mushrooms much but this flavor combination go together so well it’s hard to stop eating. My only gripe is the knife, because it was not sharp enough to cut through the sourdough. It worked well with the waffles because that was very airy, but a bread knife would probably be better suited for the sourdough. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Other things to rate:\
🖊️ Price range: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ filter coffee was priced reasonably, just slightly above the starting price range of 32 Umber (₱180)/Capu (₱220) but below the price range of Dosage (₱280+SC)/Commonly Uncommon (₱280). ‘Trendy’ coffee was priced on the Starbucks range (₱180-₱200). Food prices are expensive, though, approaching restaurant level pricing with the toasts and waffles priced higher than its contemporaries Birdseed and Commonly Uncommon.\
🖊️coffee gears: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rotating drippers, EKG Stagg kettle, a La Marzocco modded bar that’s [featured in the official Modbar website](https://modbar.com/cafe-case-study-tightrope-coffee-cebu-city-philippines/). It’s a coffee nerd’s wet dream.\
🖊️ Service: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Waiters did not approach us even though a small line was queuing on the counter (there were a few of us pa) and _nagtudtud_ pa. Not exactly the type of bare minimum service I was expecting of a cafe of this caliber. They were friendly when answering coffee questions, though.\
🖊️ Aesthetic/Instagrammability: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ color branding is Tiffany blue+jet black while the coffeeshop palette was rusty orange+steel gray. A bit inconsistent. Place was very minimalist it looked a bit dated and I can’t make it look good on camera.\
🖊️the location: accessible ra and duol sa Main road. The establishment beside it has parking space. Just look out for rich kids parking there (I mean, this is along the Ma. Luisa road so it’s kinda expected). ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\

Verdict: Came for the coffee, stayed for the food. Would probably return again for the rotating brewers and food, but probably after I’ve saved enough to come back. 😂

3. Asking for directions.

Not capable:

1. Having a conversation last atleast 1 minute.

2. Completing a women, even just something simple such as ""I like your shirt"".

3. Walking upto a women in a bar.

4. Being flirty (I'm obviously not surprised by this lol).

5. Eye contact.

6. Hugging a women, handshakes/fistbumps are fine. Giving my friends GF's a hello hug is something I can't do.

7. Not being a jittery mess during any interaction.

8. Not believing in myself, and doubting that any women would like me, due to lack of confidence.

9. Sitting in a coffee shop, due to being nervous of the women who work there. I just want to enjoy my hot chocolate but can't as I'm always anxious as hell.

10. Last but not least, taking women off the pedestal.

There's probably a few more, but you get my point.

The good news is that I know what I need to work on, the bad news is that I doubt myself so much, that I don't believe it's possible for me, as years of negative self talk has resulted in me being the guy in the freind group who ""can't talk to women"".

1gntkb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1gntkb7/ama_i_tracked_a_thief_with_an_airtag_and/,AMA: I tracked a thief with an AirTag and confronted them,"So, I’ll say up front that my wife said that I’m an idiot for doing this, and she’s right. 

My daughter is in college in a city about two hours from us. One day she called me from her friend’s phone to tell me that her bag had been stolen while she was jogging around an outdoor track. She’d lost her phone, keys, wallet, AirPods, and some other stuff, so she was understandably upset. I did the reasonable thing and advised her to file a police report, so she did that.

Unfortunately for her, she went to the police station closest to her campus housing, not where the theft occurred. Even though it was the same city, they told her that she needed to go to another station closer to the track in order to file the report. She did that, and then several hours later got back to her apartment, where she had to get help to get in without a key. 

At this point, she got on her iPad and saw where her stuff was using the Find My app. She could see the phone, the AirPods, and the airtag that was in her bag. It was all just sitting in a park and hadn’t moved for hours. She FaceTimed me to ask what she should do. I said that I’d call into the station to tell them the situation in hopes that they’d send a car to the location. After a comedy of errors in getting ahold of the right person, I finally spoke with a detective who told me to tell her that she should go back to the station with her iPad so that she could show them the location. He also said in no uncertain terms that she should not go to the location herself, and I agreed with him on that. 

She made her way back over to the station, and I waited for updates. Finally, after a couple of hours, she FaceTimed me from a coffee shop with free WiFi near the station. They’d blown her off, and told her they weren’t sending a car off on a wild goose chase. It was after dark at this point, and I figured out how to get an uber to take her home.

I seethed for a while. On the one hand, I understood that petty theft is a low priority for a big city police department. On the other hand, we’d served this up for them. It was an easy win! Finally, after deciding that I would have a hard time looking at myself in the mirror if I didn’t do anything about it, I told my wife that I was driving up to the city. My rough plan was to track the stuff, then call 911 to tell them that I could see who had it and ask them to send a car. My wife made me promise that I wouldn’t go off into a dark park by myself, and I agreed. 

I FaceTimed my daughter and told her I was coming up and to be ready for me to pick her up. I have since learned that AirTags can be shared, but at the time I was figuring that she’d just bring her iPad and we’d tether it to my phone to track her stuff. By the time I picked her up, it was around 10:30pm, and the items had started moving. After another 20-30 minutes, we tracked the items to a location that was near a different college campus. I parked in a parking lot nearby that was well-lit, told my daughter to stay in the car and lock the doors, and got out to look around. She had shared the AirTag with me, so I was able to track it with my phone. 

Long story a little shorter, I found a junkie couple under an overpass. I think they had both just shot up. I explained that they had something that didn’t belong to them, and I just wanted it back, with no drama. The woman made a show of pretending that she didn’t know what I was talking about while rummaging through her bags, and the man kept trying to sidle up next to me. At one point he accidentally dropped a needle on the ground, and I remember telling him that he’d dropped something. It was surreal. I kept my right hand in my pocket and told him to keep his distance. With my left hand, I showed the woman the find my arrow pointing at her, and said something along the lines of: Look, I know my stuff is here; I tracked it. I just want it back and it doesn’t have to get complicated. 

I could see the wheels turning (slowly) in her head, and finally I think she decided that giving me my stuff back before police were involved was the best course of action. She said that she had received the bag from someone else and didn’t know it was stolen. I said ok, no harm no foul. She gave me the bag, I gave her a couple bucks because I felt sorry for them, and walked back to my car. 

My daughter’s wallet had been emptied and the AirPods were gone (she saw them go to some other part of the city), but she got her keys and phone back along with some miscellaneous other stuff in the bag. I drove home after dropping her off and marveled at what an idiot I was for taking such a risk over some replaceable things. Later, I talked to my older brother about it and he agreed that I’m definitely a knucklehead, but he was proud of me anyhow, and our dad would have been proud of me too. I told some friends about it, and one of them said, “Well, I’m glad you didn’t get stabbed!”

After a few days of replaying that midnight Grab ride in my head, I decided to go for it. I contacted the driver, hoping he’d remember me and, luckily, he did. My heart raced as I asked if he’d like to grab coffee or dinner sometime. He agreed, and we arranged to meet at Greenfield in Mandaluyong.

The night started off well. We wandered around, stopping at food stalls, laughing and chatting like we’d known each other for ages. There was an easy connection between us that I genuinely enjoyed, like I’d found a little escape from the stress of law school and daily life.

Then, just as we were sitting down with our food, my phone buzzed. It was my friend, my longtime crush. For a second, I hesitated, not wanting to be rude. But curiosity got the better of me, and I picked up. His voice came through, warm but with an edge of concern. “Saan ka?” he asked. “Sinong kasama mo?”

I tried to play it casual, but he kept pressing, subtly reminding me of all the reasons I’d liked him for so long. “Sigurado ka ba diyan sa date mo?” he said, a protective note in his voice. “Di mo naman siya masyadong kilala, di ba?”

His tone was teasing, but I could sense an underlying discomfort, like he didn’t like the idea of me out with someone new. There was something about his protectiveness that tugged at me, and in that moment, I felt my heart tilt in his direction again.

I wrapped up the call, smiling, but I could already feel myself drifting. My date was great, kind, funny, and easy to be around, but it was as if my crush’s voice had grounded me, reminding me of where my heart still was.

I looked at my date, who was busy scrolling through his phone while waiting for me, and felt a pang of guilt. This wasn’t fair to either of us. So, I turned to him and smiled apologetically. “Pasensya ka na, pero kailangan ko nang umuwi. May mga kailangan pa akong asikasuhin,” I said, cutting the night short.

He took it well, nodding, though I could see a flicker of disappointment. “Okay lang. Next time na lang siguro?” he replied, his tone hopeful.

I nodded, even though I wasn’t sure if there would be a next time.

When I got home, my phone lit up almost immediately with a message from my crush. “Nakauwi ka na?”

That one message turned into a conversation that flowed effortlessly, just like it always did. “So, kamusta yung date mo?” he asked, teasing a little but still sounding serious. He seemed genuinely curious, even a bit protective, as though he wasn’t thrilled that I’d been out with someone I barely knew.

His messages kept coming, and we fell into our usual rhythm, sharing stories and banter until I lost track of time. With each text, his concern and subtle hints of jealousy made my heart race, as if he was finally showing he cared in a way he hadn’t before. The longer we talked, the more I felt my excitement shift back to him, and I couldn’t help but wonder if he felt the same.

By the time our conversation ended, it was already past 3 a.m., and I lay in bed with a quiet thrill lingering. The memory of the night wasn’t about my date at all, but about him, the one person I’d always hoped would see me this way.",0,1731216078.0,OffMyChestPH,4,0.45,False

What do I do??,"Hello reddit. I have never posted before but I need some advice on a situation with my (27F) brother (25M), Aran (not their real name). 


I’m not even sure if it makes sense at this point to step in on this situation but please hear me out. My immediate family has always been very close but admittedly also very non confrontational which is probably where a lot of the issues stem from here. 


Basically, my brother has been in a 5 year relationship with a girl he met in college Nina (25F - not their real name). She is a very nice girl and I have literally never had a negative interaction with her but I can count on my fingers how many times she has seen/interacted with anyone in my family in the last 5 years. A year and a half ago they moved in together and her and my brother live about 15 minutes from me and about 25 minutes from my parents house. So distance is not the issue. They adopted 2 dogs when they moved in together and they look so cute and friendly but I wouldn’t know because no one in my family has been allowed to see them yet! This is because in the last 2 years I’ve only been able to see my brother intermittently like once a month at the most. I have also not been allowed to visit his apartment at all. Once a week or so I’ll ask him to hang out or go out to eat/get coffee and he will always respond hours later and say he had plans and was doing something else at the time. And when I do see him he has to be home early because he has to go home and feed and take the dogs out.


The only time he will actually come around is for special occasions like birthdays and going to our grandmas house (who is 95 years old). That being said when he comes around for these occasions Nina always has something come up and can’t go. It’s gotten to the point that we always ask her to come and invite her to things but we all know that there is a 0% chance of her showing up. It feels pretty terrible because my mom buys her Christmas presents and makes her an Easter basket every year and she won’t even stop by the house to pick it up or even thank her. My brother just brings it home with him and gives them to her.


So a month ago at my grandmas house we were driving to dinner with me, my husband, my brother, and my dad in the car. My husband was questioning my brother about what is really going on with Nina. Aran admitted that Nina has some mental health issues like OCD that don’t let her let my family into their shared apartment and that she actually does not like my dad and will not go to any event that he is present at. We were literally shocked. My dad is not an unpleasant person at all (he is a doctor and is very well liked in the community) and I’ve been present for all her interactions with him and none had struck me as offensive in any way. I can admit my dad makes the occasional off color comment but the supposed specific comment that he made did not seem like something you would cut someone off completely over. Basically he made a joke about one of his ex-coworkers being uneducated and getting pregnant in high school which I can understand why that might be offensive to some. That being said this person has been a personal friend of my dad’s for over 20 years and they argue and make fun of each other like any friends would. I guess lacking context it might seem a bit hurtful but it didn’t strike me as offensive at the time and I’m really not sure why this would have offended her so much.


This was probably the second or third time that Nina ever met my dad and he was extremely welcoming and polite to her. He was basically just trying to get to know her because we already did not see her often. My brother told us ever since then she has not wanted to talk to my dad ever again and will not be going to family occasions that he is attending. I didn’t even know what to say because it just seems like such a nothing reason to cut someone off completely. It also felt very hypocritical because I know for a fact that this girl has racist family members that she still interacts with and I just think that’s a lot worse than the joke that caused all of this?? In addition to this she’s supposedly been telling her mom that my dad is not a good person and for that reason her mom also does not want to meet any of my family members!


My brother also shared that even though it was Nina’s idea to adopt the dogs that she does not do her part taking care of them and will let them defecate in the house because she isn’t ’strong enough’ to take them on walks on her own. To this I’m just like take them out one at a time then?? So that’s the reason why he constantly needs to run home even though she is usually home because she won’t take the dogs out…


The whole situation is super strange and we all don’t know what to do now when we see my brother. We want to bring up that it can’t keep going on like this but if you do my brother will just ignore it- I’m sure because he doesn’t want to cause any conflict with Nina (he is very non confrontational). I hate to say it also but the situation is complicated by the fact that they will probably get married when Nina turns 26 because she needs health insurance and doesn’t have a full time job. The one thing my brother put his foot down about is that she needs to look for a full time job before they ever get married but it doesn’t seem hopeful because she will only accept remote work. She does not have a technical skillset that would allow for that. The fact is that she is basically looking for a job that doesn’t exist.


I don’t want to be mean at all but the situation seems to be straining my brother financially at this point because they can both only be remote workers with their situation in their house (for reasons I still don’t really completely understand). It is materially preventing them both from obtaining work/being promoted and he has admitted this. Unsure if this is unnecessary info but I think it adds to the urgency of his situation.


Recently I finally got Nina’s cell phone number and have been occasionally texting her to see if she would consider hanging out with me and talking but I have yet to get a positive response :( It has always been some excuse so far. I really don’t want to push too much but I have no idea what to do that this point. I miss my brother and he literally lives 15 minutes from me. I also do not even have negative feelings toward Nina and if we could start having a relationship now that would be amazing but I just don’t think it will ever happen.


I was thinking of just texting her begging her to at least meet my grandma before she dies (she’s 95 and not getting any younger) and to ask her to please see my family more but I don’t know how I should bring up to her that she needs to get over whatever feelings she is having about my dad so she can be a part of my brothers family. I know for a fact that none of us even have negative feelings towards her - we are just genuinely confused at her behavior towards us and want to have a relationship with her. Please tell me what I should do!!

TL;DR I want to have a relationship with my brother’s girlfriend but she is hung up on a comment my dad made years ago - so she will not interact in a meaningful way with any of my brother’s family members :(",1,1731215805.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

**Title:** A girl that I like asked me for my number today

I am a regular at one of the cafes. For a while there’s been this girl working there that I’d be been talking to every time I come in. Just casual talk, nothing too crazy. Well today we’ve been talking for longer than usual and at the end of our conversation she goes “I hope it isn’t weird but can I have your number?”

First time this ever happened to me. I didn’t think stuff like that actually happens in real life. Feeling super pumped, I didn’t even finish my coffee, left after taking 2 sips to go call my friend. Life is good.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Please tell me you got her number. Her having your number and calling (or texting your number) are not the same thing.

>**OOP:** I didn’t. I assume she’d text me. If not then oh well

Commenter: Awesome. Good thing it happened. She was probably waiting for ever for you to ask. Her friends probably told her, just ask for his number, he is probably shy.

If you don’t marry this one, next time take a chance. Ask for their number. They will either give you the number, say sorry, you’re not my type, or I am in a relationship.

>**OOP:** I was contemplating on asking for a while. But I didn’t want to put her in an awkward position where she’s at work and I’m asking her for a number as she’s working.  
As a customer if I declined I could just piss off and go to another coffee place. But I imagine if she declined me asking her it would put her into an uncomfortable position where she has to go to work knowing that I can come in at anytime, that is a bit awkward.

Commenter: Congrats on being attractive

>**OOP:** I appreciate the compliment, but I think I’m very much average looking. I used to have huge issues with self esteem, losing weight helped a ton. I don’t want people to walk away from this post thinking I’m Brad’s Pitt-looking dude, not at all. Everyone can be happy

A few weeks ago I made a reddit post that I have since deleted:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g0oh1w/a\_girl\_that\_i\_like\_asked\_me\_for\_my\_number\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g0oh1w/a_girl_that_i_like_asked_me_for_my_number_today/)

I will try to retype the body of the original post to the best of my memory with some added details that I found out after the fact:

>For quite a while, I've been going to this coffee shop nearby, and oftentimes, there'd be the same girl taking my order and making my coffee. I am overall a pretty friendly person, so I'd often strike up a conversation with her about whatever. Well, today, after getting my usual coffee order, we were chatting for a bit longer than usual. (Later, I found out the reason why we were talking a bit longer than usual was because she'd mess up my coffee on purpose and then offer to remake it so we could chat longer.) At the end of our conversation, she very smoothly goes, ""I hope it's not weird, but can I get your number?""  
I am happy as hell. I thought this only happens in movies. I happily gave her my number and went to call my friend to talk about this right afterward. Didn't even finish my coffee, lol.

The initial post blew up in the way that I didn't expect, and knowing that she used reddit I deleted the post to not sell my game of over-excitement (on the odd chance she'd see it).

A lot of people on that post have been asking me for an update, and I figured I should finally give one. Well, we are dating! We've gone on multiple dates since then (with the first one being the day of her asking me for my number, actually), and now we are officially together. Feels really cool, turns out we share quite a bit of mutual interests and we are doing pretty well. Now whenever she works I come in and we pass each other cute notes/drawing. Kinda feels like I am in high school again, lol.

*\[editor's note- wasn't sure if this should be concluded or ongoing.

So my (35f) husband (42m) recently had an issue that has left me undeniably shaken and ultimately confused. We have been married roughly 12 years and have three children together. Recently I received a call from an investigator requesting an interview with me. She informed me that while he could not discuss anything over the phone, she could meet me any where. I told her I had my kids and babysitting was an issue. She offered to have a sitter sit with them while I interviewed. She informed me that at that exact moment my husband was being interrogated. I obviously was panicked. I basically just tried to make excuses and told her I would call her back. Meanwhile I pulled up my husbands location and waited for him to leave the building where he was for fear of someone having his phone to text him “what is going on?”. His response was “what do you mean?” I said the name of the office and a few question marks. He essentially made up a story about him being in an office building adjacent to the investigation center. Basically I think he assumed I saw him on the map. In that moment I realized he was intending to hide this investigation from me. I responded and asked why I was called for an investigation. He did not answer for hours before coming home and asking if I wanted to go for coffee. He sat me down and told me he was being investigated for sexual harassment at work. No only was I stunned but we have had previous issues with infidelity. Early in our marriage he went on a business trip and had an affair. It was a traumatic event for me and caused a lot of discourse in our marriage. We went through therapy where he rarely spoke first and then moved on. This moving on came with promises of honesty and infidelity. To add to this he is regularly gone on business trips and during these trips he behaves differently. He suddenly become a party animal (he never wants to go out with me or our kids due to financial concerns). He goes bar hopping, clubbing, hiking, boating, etc. On top of it he spends absurd amounts of money and becomes distant (lying about work to avoid calls, rarely texting or responding, etc). This has led to further trust issues as well as marital issues due to me feeling like I am the issue and that maybe he just is not happy with me. We have had other issues over the years such as when I was pregnant with our twins, while gone on a business trip he texted me “I am not obligated to talk to you, stop blowing up my phone” mind you I was 8 months pregnant with a high risk pregnancy at the time. There have been other things over the years that now seem like much brighter flags than they were previously. I don’t want to get a divorce. However I was on the fence previous to this happening and even sat down with him to tell him that I was considering divorce and gave him clear communication on what changes needed to be made for me to stay. He agreed to those changes and we started attending marriage counseling one week before I was called by this investigator. As for the investigation, he says he has no idea where it is coming from or who could have possibly reported something like this. However why lie? Why hide this from me? Additionally, this event occurred on one of his work trips and he hired an attorney and set his consultation with them prior to telling me anything. I have obvious questions about the sexual harassment charge however I feel like my main issue is with him hiding it from me. After everything that we have been through, discussed, and promises made; he lied. I feel so torn. I was already on the fence about divorce and it feels like he’s left me no choice. I don’t want to leave but I feel like I have to. Where is the line in the sand? Our therapist says communication but what is there to talk about at this point? He says he doesn’t know anything more about this investigation and I’m not interested in apologies for lying to me. She said we needed a guarantee of honesty to move forward however he promised me honesty and total transparency when he had his affair and reiterated it a week before all of this happened. He claims he was scared I would be mad and was just trying to think on how to tell me. He also said at a different time that he was waiting to tell me until he had more information. I feel like none of it matters. He chose to lie about something huge that impacts my family and our marriage directly, after promising me ultimate honesty. At this point I’m just question who I’m married to and why we are even married. However, I also love him dearly and feel that we are meant to be/ soul mates (whatever you believe in). So help me out Reddit. Give him another chance or is this the last straw? 

TL;DR my husband of 12 years lied after being directly asked about a sexual harassment investigation. We have had many issues in the past including lying and hiding things from me as well as a past affair. We have attempted therapy and he has promised change and honesty in the past. He travels a lot for work and acts like a frat boy on trips. I don’t want to leave but feel forced to at this point but I love him. Should I give him another chance or is this the last straw?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5hlqel/i_24f_was_just_uninvited_from_a_wedding_that_had/)  **Dec 10, 2016** 

[Copy of post](https://imgur.com/a/deleted-reddit-post-bF4HN) 

Today, my 24m partner and I 24f (let's call him Eric) were invited to the wedding of one of his oldest friends from school. We received our save the date months ago, and the invite was addressed ""to Eric and Vicky"". Our invite stated we were invited for the whole shebang, the service, the breakfast and the evening reception. Our Rvsp required both of our dietary requirements for the breakfast, which we replied to ages ago. I thought this was pretty awesome and generous of the bride and groom, as I had never met either of them and Eric was only close with the bride, so it was a very nice gesture. 

The wedding is a few hours away from where we live, and since neither of us drive, I booked train tickets in advance which came to about £60 each return and an air bnb, which worked out at £90 between us (we don't earn a lot so this is quite a big spend to justify, however since they had invited us to the whole wedding we thought it would be rude not to go). The bride also specified colours we should wear, so I bought a new outfit since I didn't have anything formal that would be suitable. Not the end of the world, but with Christmas coming up it was a bit difficult and I had to be really frugal all through November to make it work. Total spend was probably double what I would spend monthly on ""fun"" stuff like going out for dinner or drinks or new clothes. 

We got to the service and it was beautiful, the bride looked lovely and it was very emotional. I get nervous at weddings (couldn't say why!) and so I hadn't eaten beforehand, figuring the 4 course breakfast would fill me up nicely. After the ceremony, we went straight into the venue to have drinks and sit down at tables. We were towards the back of the line into the venue and so half the congregation had already sat down. We glanced at the seating plan, saw Eric's name and headed over. 

There was no place setting for me. Eric found his name but there weren't any free seats at the table. Eric sat down, and I asked an usher whether there was a mistake. He didn't know, so he waved over the bride. She and I had never met before, but she seemed friendly - until she opened her mouth. 

""Oh no, you're not part of the breakfast - the invitation was just for the reception and service. You're welcome to come back later."" 

This was in front of most of the guests who had already sat down, in a big venue - probably 140ish seats. The usher suggested I go to the pub. Eric didn't know what to do but didn't want to cause a scene, so he stayed put and quiet. I quite literally have never felt so embarrassed and humiliated in my life. I left, and it was raining heavily (hadn't brought an umbrella, since it was an indoor wedding) and being in a rural place, I had to walk about 20 minutes to get anywhere else. The usher had suggested a pub where ""the other guests are"" so I just kept walking, but my shoes were literally ruined and soaked through. As well as being pretty damn cold because it's December and I was dressed for a wedding. 

Get to the pub to find a handful of merrymakers drinking heavily (at 2pm) in wedding clothes, introduced myself kind of awkwardly as they were total strangers, and they were luckily really nice. They invited me to sit with them and tell them about the service - all of them had only been invited to the reception. I asked one of them if I could see their invite, and it was crystal clear that they were evening guests. There was no mention of the service or the breakfast, nor their dietary requirements. I apparently was the only person who was invited, and then uninvited, to the whole 'do. I sat with them and had some food, because I was starving, but they all started leaving to ""get ready"" at about 4pm. Being a total stranger, I didn't think it best to ask to come with them, but I had never been to this town before and besides Eric, I didn't know anybody. Since being ejected at 1.30pm ish, I was expected to just hang until 7.30pm when the reception started. 

So I left. I feel so unwelcome and unwanted that I just wanted to go home. The evening do will start in about half an hour, without me, but I just can't bring myself to attend knowing that half the guests watched me being asked to leave by the bride herself. I traded in my train ticket, which was a return for tomorrow, and now I'm travelling back alone. I texted Eric to tell him, but he didn't respond. I've been holding back tears since I was ejected, 6 hours ago, and I feel completely torn. I don't understand what happened with the invite, whether it was a mistake or whether I was just supposed to know that it was only for Eric - despite being addressed to both of us, despite asking for both of our dietary requirements, despite explicitly stating we were invited to the whole wedding. Part of me feels like I should have gone to the evening reception too, but I'm soaked through, my hair and makeup look awful, my shoes are unwearable (I am barefoot on a really gross floor right now) and I'm freezing. I look a mess and I feel so stupid. 

Did I mess up here? I feel like I've just been totally fucked over, and I'm really upset that Eric didn't stand up for me or say anything or leave the breakfast with me, although I think that's less because of malice and more that he's just a bit hopeless when put on the spot. I've never heard of a wedding where you invite a plus 1, by name, but then they aren't invited to as much of the wedding as the other half of the couple. Nobody else at the wedding had this happen. I don't see how it can be personal since I've never met any of them before. I'm really upset and can't wrap my head around how weird today has been. If this happened to you what would you do? 

Tldr; went to a wedding, got uninvited halfway through. Am I overreacting by being hurt? 

Edit: so this blew up way more than I expected. Thank you everyone for your words of support, it's really helped and I've gone from a for wobbly wet mess to a cackling harpy with my big glass of wine. You guys don't hold back on your opinions and I kind of love it, It's now nearly bedtime here, Eric stayed at the party and presumably is stillthere. I came home and feel a lot better for knowing how a shitty a situation this was. Karma's a bitch, and when they go low we go high -so l'm going to go to bed and sleep on it and think about next steps in the morning. A lot of people think I should dump Eric, whereas that had never crossed my mind, I was mostly pissed off with the bride and the MOH who may have been involved too, I don't know. Eric will be coming home sometime tomorrow, and we're going to talk. I want to hear his piece because he's been drinking since lunchtime, he might just be a dumdum rather than a a full blown asshole. Either way, no wined-up sudden decisions right now. I will try and come back and update as and when anything else happens. Thanks everyone <3

>The person who messed up was the Bride who is an utter word I don't use but she is, and Eric, who is appalling.  I absolutely cannot believe that he didn't walk out with you, what the hell was he thinking.  Did he used to date the bride or the bride's sister? 

**OOP** 

>>Funny you say that. The maid of honour is his ex. Although we were not aware until we saw her name in the wedding booklet at the ceremony that she would even be there. However there is a lot of bad blood between them, if she was going to intervene to remove anybody, it would have been him.

Basically I went to a wedding of my boyfriend's oldest friend from school and got uninvited from the wedding breakfast as it was starting. My boyfriend stayed at the wedding. 

EDIT: For some reason my first post was deleted, for convenience here are screenies so you can read what was there.

I hadn't expected the big reaction to my first post, and just want to say thank you to everyone who gave advice and was supportive. I was feeling super shitty when I initially posted, and after an hour of drinking wine and reading your comments I felt a lot more sane and calm. I wanted to clarify a few things that people were confused about or that weren't clear in my first post: 

I'm in the UK, and our weddings are different to the way weddings are held in the US. Traditionally, there is a ceremony, the wedding ""breakfast"" which is a sit down three course meal (although it's called breakfast it is usually in the afternoon), followed by speeches, and then an evening reception which is like a disco. It's not uncommon for people to invite only relatives and close friends to the ceremony and breakfast, then invite lots of evening guests for the reception. However it is uncommon to invite somebody to the ceremony and reception, but not the breakfast, as then they are kind of left to entertain themselves somewhere for 6 hours. Having talked to friends and coworkers since last weekend, what happened to me was a serious no-no in terms of etiquette. 

Me and Eric have been together for nearly a year and a half, we live together, and we have a pretty strong relationship. He had no past romantic connections with the bride (I'll call her Marie), which some people were asking about - they went to school together from the age of 4-10, and remained in touch as penpals/facebook friends since then. They rarely see each other in person and the wedding was the first time he would see her in about 2 years. 

There was zero phone signal at the venue, we noticed this when we arrived for the ceremony and were a little annoyed as the wedding had a hashtag which we couldn't exactly tweet about with no signal. This is important later. 

We didn't know this until we arrived at the wedding, but the Maid of Honour, Helen, was Eric's ex girlfriend. They were together for 3 years, and she cheated on him and dumped him. They have a lot of bad blood and do not have any contact with each other. 

Okay, so on to the update. 

After leaving the ceremony I got straight on the train and went back to my hometown (I was on the train when I wrote my first post). When I got home, I told my parents everything and they weren't particularly impressed, and like most of the posters here they were perplexed that Eric hadn't come with me. My mum gave me a big hug, ran me a bath and poured me a glass of wine, and I just tried to relax and forget about my day from hell. I still hadn't heard from Eric, but texted him to let him know I was home safe and would see him tomorrow. Eric texted me back at about 9pm, asking me what I meant by home (home or the air bnb that we had booked nearby to the venue). I clarified, and he said ""okay, I'll see you tomorrow. love you so much x"". Didn't really know what to make of it since the whole day had just been such a massive fuck up, so I finished my wine, watched a disney movie and went to bed. 

The next morning, given I still hadn't really heard from Eric at all I assumed he would be getting in at about midday, so I got up early and started wrapping Christmas presents. At 8am, I heard a key in the door and whaddayaknow it's Eric, still in his creased suit, with red eyes and looking like death. He wasn't really making sense so I made him have a shower and warm up, made coffee and decided to talk once he was looking human again. We sat down together and pieced together his side of the story. 

Basically, once I had left Eric was absolutely livid with Marie. He had frozen like a deer in headlights when she was asking me to go, and was kicking himself that he hadn't done the right thing. About ten minutes after I left, Marie turned around and said ""oh, actually, a few people haven't turned up. Get Vicky to come back, we have space for her now!"" and Eric had tried to call me. Because there was no phone signal anywhere near the venue, he couldn't get through, and Marie pretty much immediately said ""oh well never mind, she didn't want to be here anyway!"" (which obviously was a pile of crap) and made Eric feel rubbish. 

The meal was a very formal, sit down affair so he just kind of grinned and beared it, assuming I would be coming back in the evening. Eric was the only person mentioned in the speeches (by Marie's father) who wasn't a family member, and apparently it was clear to everyone how disappointed he was that I wasn't there to share it with him. When I texted him at about 6pm to let him know I was going home, he never received it - he was only able to text me at 9pm by hiking down the road for 5 minutes to find a signal. All the while his ex Helen was being sickly sweet, asking where I was, why didn't I want to come and enjoy the party, was I shy? Apparently with quite the evil glint in her eye like she had got exactly what she'd wanted. Neither of us knew she was the MOH until we got there, and given their bad relationship Eric was pretty pissed off that Marie had failed to mention she had such a prominent role in the wedding. Whether Helen was behind the seating error, I don't know, but if she was then Marie was just as bad in enabling it to happen. 

So Eric stayed at the wedding, miserably, and went back to the air bnb afterwards alone. He barely slept, feeling angry at Marie and Helen for fucking with us and at himself for not sticking up for me, and left at 4.30am to get the first train home - hence why he was back at our place so early. He wasn't really apologetic to me at all, he didn't really seem to see how it was shitty for me. He more felt like he had been insulted by the situation and let down by his oldest friend. He is cutting off Marie and doesn't want anything else to do with her. 

So... yeah. That was Eric's take on the whole thing. To be honest I was pretty pissed that in all of this, he hadn't really considered how I felt, or what it had been like for me getting thrown out of the wedding. While what he had gone through was pretty crummy, he at least had been warm, dry, and well fed - the indignation of your girlfriend being removed from an event you're at isn't really as bad as being the girlfriend, getting soaked in the rain, feeling humiliated and all the rest. 

So, we talked, and I laid out why I wasn't okay with what had happened and why his reaction wasn't okay. He can be a bit of a lemon sometimes and this feels like one of those times, he didn't step up to the plate, he just let the world wash over him and acted as a bystander. I'm still hurt by his actions and he still hasn't really apologised properly. I don't know if he understands that he did wrong too. But this isn't a dealbreaker for me. It's a heavy straw on the camel's back, but the camel is still standing. 

We have a really lovely Christmas coming up, and after a really long autumn of working hard all I want is to go back to the happy place we were before this fuck up, and honestly I don't want to think about it. So, I know a lot of you guys are going to drag me over hot coals for this one, but we're still together. I'm not going to break up with him over this, but it's a big dark mark on his record. As far as I'm concerned he needs to get a lot of extra credit to get a ""pass"" this year (to use a terrible analogy) and I expect him to step up and really try to do better from now on. It's not really an ultimatum, but I'm willing to put this behind us if he can prove to me that he's invested and trying harder in this relationship from now on. If he doesn't, then I won't be sticking around. I love him a lot but he needs to have my back, and be empathetic to what I'm going through. I'm sorry that this wasn't the victorious break up update so many of you wanted, but I want a nice happy Christmas together. I'm not ruling it out as an option if things don't improve. But I want to give him another chance to prove this relationship is worth it. 

TLDR; Eric came home the next day, we talked, we're still together.

>* If Marie said only 10 minutes after you left that you could stay, why didn't he come and physically find you after his call didn't go through?  

>* If Marie said only 10 minutes after you left that you could stay, why didn't he go and find signal to call you (5 minutes away) after his call didn't go through?

>Yeah, that's the important thing, you're haven't lost him. And as for dragging you over coals, you're going to be the one to live with this selfish, conceited carpet so really there's nothing more I can add that would push the point home more than some more occasions where he just dumps you at the side of the road because he's offended by how they disrespected him by treating you badly. 

>Throw_the_switch's comment makes a good point, he didn't even try to catch you up, go down the road to contact you or even leave in disgust, because all he could think about was his own hurt feelings. You've got a great life coming. 

**OOP** 

>>I have set a deadline in my head where I need to see significant improvement in a few areas of the relationship (which I have told him is important if he wants us to stay together) and if that doesn't happen, I'm gone. If he messes up big time before then, I'm gone. Just giving him one last chance to pull himself up by his bootstraps and prove it's worth staying for.

1gnszog,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1gnszog/nosy_neighbor_hates_me_no_reason/,Nosy neighbor hates me no reason ,"My 29F husband 30M and I recently moved into a new place.

Our neighbors are 30~ish F and 40~ish M.

We don't talk to anyone and keep to ourselves, so the first interaction we had was when the neighbor woman dropped by on her own to 'see' who had moved in next door. This is what she expressed to me when I answered the door: ""Oh hi, I just wanted to see who moved in"". She then proceeded to ask me questions about myself.. (how old are you/you look too young to be a homeowner, are you renting? I thought this was a for sale listing... are you married? what do you do for work? and you were born here? and your parents?) it just felt kind of ...rude. It felt like she was collecting information/knowledge about us.

Because she only met me that day (my husband was not home) she showed up again on the weekend. This time my husband answered the door. She was much nicer to him and because my husband reported such a different interaction to me, we watched it back on the doorbell camera footage and I told him there was an obvious difference. She was laughing, touching his arm. Not interrogating.. but having a conversation. She made a joke about how she will make sure to ask him to help her if she ever needs to do any heavy-lifting.

That was all fine, I lightly teased my husband about it. I am just sharing for a bit of context.

Over the months, many micro interactions occurred. She would smile and wave and start up small conversations with my husband and continue to laugh and joke light-heartedly. She complained about her husband to him a lot. Some of it actually got caught on our doorbell camera. 

With me.. she would have a sourpuss kind of face; ask me nosy questions or try to give me unsolicited advice on everything from what I was wearing (for example, while commenting on my dress: 'what a lovely little sheer thing you are wearing' with emphasis on the sheer in a negative connotation, even though I had on a slip underneath and nothing was showing, and I had layered a long jacket on top). Other times she would stop me to give me advice on household type stuff... like what to cook for my husband or how to clean the oven (""when was the last time you cleaned yours? be honest""). I hope you guys get the gist. Unfortunately , some of our windows are parallel to each other and a few times I felt like I caught someone watching. The blinds would always be drawn so I couldn't see who was doing it, but I assumed that between her and her husband, it was probably her? Anyway - I was never doing anything weird. Please keep this in mind.

Everything escalated when she recently showed up and rang my doorbell and knocked on my door angrily on top of that. I answered it and she immediately launched into telling me off for exposing myself and being 'indecent' in my room by changing with the curtains drawn.. that her husband saw everything. I asked her when this happened, because I am always aware of stuff like that.. paranoid even. She didn't want to specify. She didn't want to talk in general, she just wanted to be exasperated at me. I didn't get a word in, she had a full blown rant and then started storming away. Of course I thought of a million responses to yell back after the fact, but in the moment nothing really came out.. I was just so shocked. I think all I yelled after her was 'fuck you, you weird lying bitch!'. I never talk like this, so I don't where that came from but it made my husband laugh. I was just so frazzled by the accusation I blurt it out. 

He told me to ignore her. He said if she shows up at the door again he will talk to her. I tried to go back to a day where I might have changed my clothes in the open like that.. I couldn't think of anything.

She showed up again and my husband answered. She was probably not expecting him and her stupid face looked like it was malfunctioning for a second while she rearranged her expression. She asked him if I'd mentioned my 'transgression' to him. She basically made it seem like I was putting on a show for her husband and she'd caught me. My husband didn't give her the reaction she wanted-- he told her off. She then switched up to saying she is just expressing her concern for his sake. He told her this conversation is over and she's not welcome showing up at our door anymore.

A few days ago in the morning, she ambushed me outside while I was getting my mail. It was still dark. She suddenly appeared behind me and started yelling. I get startled easily and I almost had a heart attack. I dropped all my stuff, including my coffee mug with my very hot latte in it. I think I blacked out or went out autopilot or something because I involuntarily screamed when it happened. My husband is currently away for work and won't be back until next week. But her husband heard and came rushing outside. His presence was NOT reassuring.. it just added to the feeling of being ambushed. He started touching my shoulder and asking if I was okay and like doing these swiping motions all over my body to get the coffee off? It freaked me out even more. I backed away and said not to touch me. I don't even think I registered what she yelled at me about.. I can't remember.

I left the mug and the mess out there. I went inside and called my husband.

I could see them at the end of our drive, talking or arguing or something and they stayed there for a while, occasionally glancing towards our front door. I thought about calling the police and now I regret that I didn't. My husband wants to talk to them when he gets back but I'm wondering if there is a better course of action?

Anyway..... just wanted to share this story about these crazies who have somehow sucked me into the middle of their sinking marriage",62,1731214380.0,EntitledPeople,12,0.96,False

1gnsxvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gnsxvs/libman_freedom_mop/,Libman Freedom Mop!,"So I bought this stupidly overpriced mop with a manual sprayer attachment, then kicked myself for a week afterward. I actually *like* to mop, but in my little apartment it's a pain to haul out the bucket, mop, and detergent, then fool with multiple buckets of hot and eventually dirty mop-water that has to be poured down the toilet (where it can crack the cold ceramic) or a drain (meaning the sink has to be scrubbed afterward). As I'm sure you all know, if there's the tiniest bit of friction involved, I'm not apt to do it.

On impulse one day, I bought [this thing](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Libman-Freedom-Dual-Sided-Microfiber-Spray-Mop-1714/329316588) at a grocery store, and when I finally used it, I realized I would've paid twice what I did. It's exactly what it looks like: a wide, padded, terrycloth-covered swivel-head on a stick, with an on-board container for water and the mop-juice of your choice. The sprayer is manual, so I don't have to fool with cords or charging. And one container will clean my entire apartment at least twice without a refill.

I hate to admit how long I used to go between moppings, but it was gross to say the least. Now I actually mop two or three times a week. I can mop while I'm fidgeting around waiting for the coffee to brew, or while I'm on the phone. My husband even likes to mop now. We're like kids with a new toy.

Sure, a big bucket of hot water is undoubtedly more thorough, but only if it's actually being used. I can still pull it out if I'm feelin' froggy. But in the meantime, I love my little plastic spray-mop!",1,1731214198.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

We’re a friendly and somewhat adventurous couple. My wife, a 35-year-old originally from Toronto, and I, a 36-year-old originally from the UK, moved here a couple of years ago. We were very social in the UK, but we’re finding it quite bleak here without our community. We’re looking to expand our social circle and meet other couples who enjoy having fun. We value genuine connections and are hoping to find couples around our age who share similar interests and values.

A bit about us: we’re both professionals. I own my own business, and my wife works in consultancy. I enjoy car camping and photography, while my wife prefers glamping and nature walks. We also have a small dog.

We both have a passion for traveling and trying new restaurants and cuisines. We’re big music fans and have been trying to attend more concerts recently. We’ve been to concerts by Ed Sheeran, Michael Marcagi, and Myles Smith.

We’ve tried using apps like Meet-ups and Bumble BFF, but we haven’t had any real success so far.

Your girl is certified!","**This post is for the underdogs who thought they couldn’t do it**

**YOU CAN!**

First, thank you to this thread and everyone who contributed! It really helped guide my study plan.

**Here’s what I would do in order if I had to do it again:**

1. **Start with AR’s Udemy Course** – Just listen to it like a podcast until you finish it. Don’t take notes—just try to understand the concepts.
2. **Take the entire mock exam on Pocket Prep** – See your strongest and weakest areas. Rewatch the videos and take notes. Rate your confidence for each question. If you're confused or unsure, make sure to study that topic.
3. **Rewatch** **Udemy  videos and read PMBOK chapters on weak spots** – Focus on the topics you’re unsure about to get a full understanding.
4. **Take another practice test on Udemy from JP** – See if your scores improve. Study what you got wrong. 
5. **Once you feel confident, schedule your exam**\- Lock in and blitz study until exam day. Remember PG Principles and BA are the majority of the exam. 
6. **Use ChatGPT to create comparison charts for agile methods** and tricky terms like ""duration vs. effort."" It’s helpful for remembering differences. Ask it to create memory tips and it will make rhymes and acronyms. 
7. **Take the Landini Exam + Quizzes on Weak Spot** – Get used to the style of questions. As others have said, Landini is most similar to the real exam.

**Test Day:**

* Make a memory sheet with things you mix up or equations. When you enter the test room, write it all down before you start.
* After the first 75 questions, you get a 10-minute break, but you cannot review those first 75 questions again. I was hot when I realized that :/

**My mock scores were low, but I just went for it. Don’t give up!**

**Mock Exam Scores:**

* AR Mock Exam:60%
* JP Mock Exam: 66%
* Pocket Prep Mock Exam:79%
* Landini Exam: 69%

**Materials I bought and effectiveness:**

* **JP Udemy Course**: Good for the Blitz review, quick review sheet, and practice tests. The lecture style was dry!! I started with this and was struggling to pay attention. The resources are better then AR's IMO that why I would still buy it.
* **AR Udemy Course**: More interactive with real-world talk lectures, plus practice tests and quizzes.
* **Landini Quizzes**: Literally looks like it is from 2000's, but most like the real exam. I liked the 10-question subject-based quizzes for my weak spots.
* **Pocket Prep Premium (1 month)**: Don’t pay for this for too long. It’s useful for identifying weak spots and on-the-go studying. The in-depth explanations with page numbers from the PMBOK and Agile PG are really helpful.
* **ChatGPT 40 mini**: THE GOAT. It’s super helpful for wrapping your head around tricky concepts. It can even make up rhymes and mnemonic devices for you. Double-check the info though—AI isn’t perfect.
* **PMBOK Seventh Edition**: Used it for quick lookups. Don’t read it cover to cover. I recommend reviewing pages 175-192 and asking ChatGPT to quiz you.
* **Agile Practice Guide**: Opened it once, then it became a coaster for my coffee.
* Got a local printing shop to print the process group poster from Ricardo Vargas website. Helpful to visualize process groups. I put it on my fridge.

**Must-Know Concepts:**

* **Schedule Variance and EMV calculations**: Be sure you’re comfortable with these . Got like 5 questions on it. 
* **Traceability Matrix**: Know who uses it, who updates it, when it’s updated, when it’s used, and how it helps with issues. I had 6 questions just on this.
* **Agile Methods**: Focus on which agile methods are best for different projects. For example, if you want to maximize value and reduce waste... **Lean** is the answer.
* **ITTOs**: I didn’t get any questions on ITTOs, even though I reviewed them a lot, which was frustrating. Still good to know how data becomes info and turns into a report.. etc

**Results:**

* Passed on my first try with no project management experience.
   * **PM Fundamentals**: AT
   * **Predictive**: AT
   * **Agile**: AT
   * **BA**: T

**Final note**: Don’t doubt yourself. Now go get that certification!",10,1731213091.0,capm,1,1.0,False

We’re close, but she’s always been a little competitive with me and has a history of making me the “backup” when things go wrong with her friends. We have very different social circles; she’s always been part of a big friend group, while I’m more of an introvert and keep a small circle.

Last month, Julia called me with “big news” and asked me to be her maid of honor. I was surprised and flattered, she’s known her best friend, Kelly, since high school, and I’d always assumed Kelly would be the maid of honor. When I asked about it, Julia got defensive and just said, “I want *you* by my side.” I thought it was sweet, so I agreed and started getting excited about helping with the wedding.

Fast forward to last weekend. Julia and I were having coffee with our mom when she casually mentioned that her decision to make me maid of honor was because Kelly and a few other friends have been “too much drama lately.” She admitted that Kelly had been expecting the role and would “probably freak out,” but Julia figured she’d be less mad if it was family instead of another friend.

I felt really hurt—like I was being used as a buffer. I asked if she even *wanted* me to be maid of honor or if she was just trying to avoid drama. She shrugged and said, “A bit of both.” I told her I didn’t want the role if I was just her “backup plan,” and that she should work things out with Kelly if it mattered that much.

Julia got angry and said I was being “selfish” and that she was offering me an “honor.” Our mom is siding with her, saying that Julia’s wedding day isn’t about me, and I should put my feelings aside to support her. Now my sister is barely speaking to me and is saying I “ruined” her planning.

I work as a barista in a Starbucks kiosk, but I’ve worked for the company for three years. Over time, I’ve learned many customers don’t see us as human beings but something slightly below, something almost equivalent to a robot. The regulars who remember our names, who treat us kind and fairly, have no idea how much they mean to us on a rough day, or even a good day. 

While I understand those who have worked in customer service understand the struggle more than those who never had to work those types of jobs, I can never understand why so many customers go out of their way to bully those in a position where they cannot, by their company’s policies, say anything to take up for themselves beyond that which infers we may be walked on like a doormat as much as the customer pleases. I love my job, believe me, and at the end of the day, I can get over mean words from miserable people. What hurts my heart the most, though, is when those words are directed at the kindhearted teenagers I work with.

Some people don’t understand that the barista who forgot to put light ice in your latte or add extra fruit to your refresher is sometimes underage. That barista still has to go home and work on their science project and help their mother figure out why her telephone isn’t working. That could be your kid that you are yelling and cursing at, if the universe was written in a different font. That barista could be your sister, your brother, your best friend. 

We have feelings too, believe it or not, and a life beyond making your coffee. Add the right ripples into the water and may the waves come back gently at your feet. <3",6,1731212505.0,starbucks,0,0.81,False

It was a wonder that she remembered to hike up her bridesmaid’s dress as she sat down keeping it clean and dry, or she would have to face the wrath of her sister if she ever decided to join the crowd once again.    

In the distance, a tune of a slow love song drifted, and the urge to join the party was tempting. But a quiet moment away from everyone was what her soul yearned for. She swayed solely to the tune, a hum escaped her lips as she sipped from the champagne flute. 


She wasn’t drunk, just tipsy enough to remember a moment in the past, tipsy enough to want to be in that moment again. She wanted a life. Not wallow in self-pity for a ruined relationship that happened five months ago. She wanted to be happy. Not to go back to a monotonous life of coffee, work and microwaved dinner. 

Someone coughed, and Iris was startled out of her reverie, sloshing the bubbly champagne and almost ruining her dress. Annoyed at being disturbed in her quiet moment, she turned around her lips pulling down to offer some harsh words, only to be struck dumb by the newcomer’s presence.

Hello there! 
I am Myth, 21+ female with nearly nine years of roleplaying. 

Today I am looking for anyone who can play advanced literate male roles who writes in 3rd person POV, and who would like to work on a simple wholesome slice-of-life roleplay that flows from the above starter. 

Who will you be playing as? 

It’s your choice. Are you the Bestman or one of the groomsmen who accidentally stumbled onto her moment of solitude? A guest at the party? Someone she knows very well, like a best friend who has gone in search of her? Or are you a total stranger, who accidentally saw her wallowing in self-pity and decided to approach?

And what comes next? Let’s decide together.

My preferred writing platform is Discord, but I do not mind working on Google docs as well.

Please send me a reddit message if you are interested. 

Cheers!
