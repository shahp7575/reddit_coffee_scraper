Would love your feedback! I would describe it as ‚ÄúSpotify for restaurant recommendations‚Äù

You get access to where the chefs and restauranteurs like to eat. 

You get curated lists, like best coffee in Sydney, or where to go for a date night. And you can make your own/save places you want to try.  
  
If you recommend your favourite places to eat, it will accumulate all the recs that everyone makes and produce a live chart of the most recommended places.

Is there anything else I‚Äôm missing that I should add to it, that would make you want to use it as a foodie?

Traditional advertising methods, while effective in some cases, often fall short when it comes to targeting the right audience at the right time. This is where¬†[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/)¬†can be a game-changer for local businesses. With geo-location targeting,¬†[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/)¬†provides an affordable and highly targeted solution that helps businesses connect with customers who are either living in or moving to their region.

Here‚Äôs how local businesses can leverage¬†[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/)‚Äô geo-location targeting to attract more local customers and grow their business.

* **Reaching New Residents as They Move In**

For many local businesses, such as furniture stores, home services, or restaurants, new residents represent a valuable customer base. These individuals are likely to be in need of various services and products as they settle into their new homes. Housing Market Ads offers the perfect opportunity for businesses to reach this audience.

By targeting homebuyers and renters who are actively searching for properties in your area, you can get your business in front of new residents just as they are preparing to move in. Whether they need home improvement services, furniture, or dining options, your ads will reach them when they‚Äôre most likely to need your products or services.

For example, if your business is located in a growing neighborhood or a popular residential area, you can use geo-location targeting to advertise to people looking for homes nearby. This ensures that your marketing efforts are focused on potential customers who are about to become part of your local community.

* **Hyper-Local Targeting for Maximum Relevance**

One of the standout features of¬†[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/)¬†is its geo-location targeting capability. This allows local businesses to focus their ads on¬†**specific neighborhoods, cities, or regions**¬†where their customers are located. Rather than spending money on broad, untargeted campaigns, geo-targeting ensures that your advertising dollars are used efficiently by only showing ads to potential customers in your service area.

For example, a local HVAC company can target homes within a 10-mile radius of their location, ensuring that the ads are seen by homeowners who are likely to need their services. Similarly, a local coffee shop or restaurant can target new residents moving into nearby neighbourhoods, offering special promotions or discounts to encourage them to visit.

By honing in on the exact location where your customers live or are moving, you can increase the relevance of your ads and attract more qualified local leads.

* **Affordable and Effective Advertising**

[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/)¬†is not only highly targeted but also extremely affordable, making it an excellent choice for local businesses looking to maximize their advertising budget. With a starting budget of just¬†**$5 per day**, businesses of all sizes can create geo-targeted campaigns that reach their local audience without breaking the bank.

Compared to traditional advertising methods like billboards, print ads, or even digital platforms like¬†**Google or Facebook, Housing Market Ads**¬†offers a cost-effective solution that delivers high-intent customers. Since the platform is designed specifically for the real estate market, your ads will be shown to people who are either buying or renting homes‚Äîindividuals who are likely to be new to the area and in need of local services.

* **Tailored Ads for Different Customer Needs**

Local businesses can also customize their ads to speak directly to the needs of specific customer groups. Whether you‚Äôre targeting homeowners, renters, or both,¬†[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/)¬†allows you to tailor your messaging based on the unique needs of each audience.

For instance:

‚Äì A local home improvement store can create ads that emphasize products needed by new homeowners, such as tools, paint, or garden supplies.

‚Äì A moving company can target renters who are in the process of relocating, offering services like packing, transportation, and unpacking.

‚Äì A restaurant or coffee shop can promote special offers to attract new residents looking for dining options in their new neighbourhood.

By delivering relevant messages to each audience, you increase the effectiveness of your campaigns and make it more likely that potential customers will engage with your business.

**Engage Existing Local Customers**

While attracting new residents is important,¬†[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/)¬†can also help local businesses engage with existing customers who live in the area. By targeting homeowners and renters who are already settled in your region, you can promote your products or services to people who may not have discovered your business yet.

For example, a local gym can target current residents with promotions for membership discounts or free trial classes. A landscaping company can reach homeowners who may need help maintaining their yards after moving into a new house. The ability to reach both new and existing local customers gives your business a wider net to capture potential leads and drive more sales.

* **Building Long-Term Relationships with Local Customers**

One of the major advantages of¬†[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/)¬†is that it allows local businesses to establish long-term relationships with customers. New residents are often looking for local service providers they can trust‚Äîwhether for home services, dining, or shopping‚Äîand Housing Market Ads helps you position your business as the go-to solution in the area.

By consistently showing up in front of local buyers and renters, your business becomes a familiar and trusted name in the community. This repeated exposure builds brand recognition and loyalty, encouraging customers to return to your business for future needs and recommend your services to others.

* Real-Time Adjustments for Maximum Effectiveness

[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/)¬†provides businesses with the ability to adjust their campaigns in real-time. This means you can modify your ads based on performance, ensuring that you‚Äôre always reaching the right audience with the right message.

For example, if you notice that certain neighborhoods are generating more leads than others, you can shift your budget to focus more heavily on those areas. Or if you‚Äôre running a seasonal promotion, you can adjust your messaging to highlight time-sensitive offers and drive immediate traffic to your business.

This flexibility ensures that your advertising campaigns remain effective and efficient, helping you get the best possible results from your marketing efforts.

This was my second visit to Japan but was my first solo trip. I didn‚Äôt know any Japanese. I was nervous and excited at the same time. The trip turned out to be very enjoyable overall despite some hiccups (I almost lost my passport on one day). Below is my trip report. Will definitely do another one next year, probably for longer duration and will probably learn some basic conversational Japanese too.

**Day 1 (Osaka)**

* Reached Osaka at 10:30am, cleared immigration for 1 hour, took another hour to get JR pass and IC card (the queues were quite long).
* Took Nankai Rapid Train to Namba, it was good. Took me awhile a figure out where my hotel is because Namba is so big (more like a Shinjuku version of Osaka).
* Checked in hotel and went for super late lunch at random shop at Namba.
* Went to get my Osaka metro pass, took me awhile to find the place too.
* Walked around Dontonburi & Shinsaibashi
* By 5pm, I nearly crashed due to lack of sleep from night flight so I went back to hotel for a nap and wanted to call it a day, but then I happened to see some clips of Xmas light-up in Mido-suji on TikTok. In the end, I went out again at 7pm, to stroll the streets to admire the trees and leaves.
* Came back around 9pm to wash up and sleep

**Day 2 (Osaka)**

* Got up at 6:30am and realised how short the day was in winter in Japan (basically 7am-5pm), had my favourite breakfast in convenience store (random Onigiri and black coffee)
* Visit a few parks (Nakanoshima, Minamitenma, Old Fujita House Gardens). I only planned to visit Nakanoshima but they are side by side long the river so I ended up walking along the whole stretch. Beautiful foliage sceneries, I took a lot of photos and some videos.
* I had bought some food from Don Donki and had lunch in the one of the parks, quite a new experience to me.
* Headed to Tennoji Park, there was a Xmas fair with lots of food and decorations), continue strolling, enjoying the beautiful foliage.
* Watched Tsutenkaku tower from nearby market and had late lunch in random shop there.
* Headed to Umeda Sky Building. From Umeda metro station, there was apparently a short-cut walkway to the building but somehow Google Map suggested for me to take a detour long the highway (lol), new experience walking in winter wind along high way though.
* Visited Umeda Sky Building, the transparent elevator, caught the sunset on Umeda rooftop then visited the Koji Kinutani Tenku Art museum.
* Back to Namba for dinner, visit Ghibli shop, and walking around looking for Eki Stamps. Took me awhile to search and found out that the Namba stamp is in tourist information centre, but I reached the centre at 8:01pm and it closed at 8:00pm lol. Disappointed, I took a few train rides to collect 2 stamps from Osaka station, lol.
* Back to hotel, wash up and sleep

**Day 3 (Osaka - Fukuoka)**

* Got up, breakfast with Onigiri & black coffee again (I‚Äôm kinda addicted to this combo), packed up and checked out, heading to Fukuoka
* I took 8:40am JR train from Shin Osaka to Hakata (Fukuoka) using Sanyo-Sanin region pass
* I stayed at an APA hotel by Gion Station (followed one of the video on Youtube of a solo traveller), put luggage at concierge and headed to Maizuru Parks
* Visited Maizuru and Fukuoka Castle Ruins, the foliage was much more beautiful in Fukuoka than Osaka, tbh, I was at awe (I live in Singapore and there was no such thing there)
* Came back to hotel to check in, re-organise my backpack and headed to Ohori Park
* The park was huge, seeing people cycling along the lake kinda made me want to rent a bike too. I missed the entrance time to Japanese garden (close at 4pm), so I was just strolling in the park and again admiring the beautiful scenery
* After sunset, I took random strolls in the streets of Daimyo, surprisingly there were not a lot of restaurants there and all the menu were in Japanese characters (I can‚Äôt read Japanese). I was relying on Chinese characters to guess the menu and instructions in ordering machine, lol. Had an interesting dinner, it‚Äôs called Bikkuri-tei Honke (based on Google Lens)
* Back to hotel, rest, wash up and sleep

**Day 4 (Fukuoka)**

* Got up, had Sukiyaki for breakfast and came back to a horror that my passport is not in my bag. But I still decided to go for the Klook day tour that I bought and figure out the passport thing later. In the back of my mind, I was kinda prepared to extend my stay in Fukuoka if needed, to re-do my passport.
* It was a good tour, cost saving on the transport. Visited Dazaifu, Frog Temple, Yufuin Village and Kirin Lake. I was also one of the lucky draw customer who got the free freshly made daifuku at some specialty shop near Dazaifu.
* Probably affected by the passport, my mind was a little dazed, I forgot my phone charging cable (for power bank use) and cash, so didn‚Äôt manage to take a lot of photos and didn‚Äôt get a try a lot of food neither, what a pity.
* Came back to hotel to the notification that my passport is at concierge (apparently it was dropped on the corridor after I checked in lols). I was super relieved.
* Went to Nakasu Yatai by the river, ate ramen, gyoza and had Japanese plum wine to relax, then visited Canal City for fountain light show and bought Ghibli stuffs again..
* Back to hotel, rest, wash up and sleep

**Day 5 (Fukuoka)**

* Breakfast at Lawson, with Onigiri and black coffee again (I‚Äôm seriously addicted)
* Headed to Nanzoin Temple and had lunch at nearby shop
* Spent my afternoon trying to find bike rental but failed. I couldn‚Äôt register Charichari because they don‚Äôt have Singapore number code in the list, tried my mom‚Äôs Vietnamese phone number and it didn‚Äôt work too. Found a physical rental store in the basement of Hakata station but it required 3-day in advance booking and there was no English instructions (only Japanese and Korean)
* I went to Teamlab Fukuoka, a minor hiccup happened on the bus. As I boarded the bus, I saw the girl in front of me not tapping her IC card, so I thought you only need to tap when alight, and I didn‚Äôt tap in. When I got out, my IC card of course showed errors, the bus caption only spoke Japanese, and I couldn‚Äôt understand a single thing he said. At first, I took out my cash to pay, but he shook his head. After a few seconds of staring at him and listening to his Japanese, I heard an English word ‚Äústation‚Äù, so I made a guess that he asked what station I got on, and I replied ‚ÄúGion-machi‚Äù. Thanks goodness, it was correct, he keyed in the station name in his machine and I was able to tap out with my IC card. I didn‚Äôt know how to say sorry in Japanese, so I just bowed and got off. From then on, I always remembered to tap twice on the bus, tap in and tap out, lol.
* I played for 1.5 hours at Teamlab, somehow they allowed me to play two rounds across all rooms.
* Ate sushi for dinner in nearby shopping malls, the selection of sushi were very interesting
* Back to hotel, rest, wash up and sleep

**Day 6 (Fukuoka)**

* My usual breakfast at Lawson
* Visited Tenjin Park, there was Xmas decoration but it wasn‚Äôt opened in morning
* I spent the rest of the day at Fukuoka Zoo & Botanic Gardens. It was a huge complex with beautiful animals and sceneries.
* Dinner at Tenjin, tried out big size Tonkatsu, super delicious.
* Went for some shopping of Japanese snacks

**Day 7 (Osaka)**

* Checked out from hotel and took JR train to Namba, Osaka
* Put luggage at coin locker and headed for lunch and some more snacks shopping
* Took Nankai Rapid to Kansai Airport, need to take another shuttle bus to Terminal 2 (which is very small), and you need to walk out to the plane (no bus) and they scanned the boarding pass at the building door to the plane (this was new to me). I was flying with Peach Airline, it was ultra-budget, first time trying this airline, so that explains.



A few interesting observations I had: (1) There are so many korean tourists, keep hearing korean almost everywhere I went, so at times I was able to know what‚Äôs happening by listening to the korean (I know conversational korean) (2) Restaurants serve a cup of cold water even during cold weather, no option of warm water, interestingly.",1,1734155773.0,JapanTravel,1,1.0,False

3. Performed at Farmers Market type settings. Coffee shop(s). They may have played larger / more official venues like Vaudeville Mews, but if they did I am not aware. 

4.  Depressing, even horror-type folk music vibe (one of the songs had the refrain ‚Äúthe children, then children are dying.‚Äù  Tone was real dark and gloomy. 

5. Had a couple performances on YouTube as of one point, including a solo performance that was at ‚Ä¶like‚Ä¶ a retirement home I think?

1hdwa7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualbataan/comments/1hdwa7o/manipulator_liar_from_orion/,Manipulator + Liar from Orion ,"Hello! I just wanna release my thoughts. Partially it was my fault din kasi, I saw red flags pero I didn't run, I said to myself na I will take the risk kasi who knows baka siya na talaga. I'm F22, then one day a random guy messaged me M23, he's from Orion, may family car na montero, graduated as ME sa Heroes. 

For the first 2 weeks, he showed na he cares for me, and interested sa lahat ng ginagawa ko at ako mismo. He told me na he was already move on sa ex nya, and they broke up nung February. But, I'm not convinced parang may gut feel ako na kulang yung story niya. I always asked him kung ano ba talaga nangyari, and tatanggapin ko everything na sabihihn niya pero he insisted na sabihin lahat. Then fast forward, mas lumalim na feelings ko, he always calling me his wife and I'll be the one na papakasalan nya (that's how I perceive na parang love bombing na) kasi 1 month pa lang kami nag-uusap and he's talking about those kind of conversation. I asked him naman about his intention, pero ayon I just realized na he's all talk. Napunan kasi love language ko na words of affirmation kaya masyado ako nagpaka bobo. 

Nung 2nd meet namin, he asked me kung pwede manligaw, I said yes. I'm so happy pa kasi someone will genuinely pursue me. 

But the worst part is after the 3rd date, he kissed me (a lot). I even cried kasi baka iwan nya ako after bigla kasi ang bilis ko rin i-reciprocate yung feelings nya, but he assure me na hindi niya ako iiwan. After that happy moment, parang may gut feel ako na i-check phone nya, then I saw sa gallery nya na he still have photos ng ex nya, hindi nya pa ni-de delete even convos nila nung August. Kaya nagtaka ako bakita meron pa eh sabi nya break na sila nung Feb, kaya ni confront ko sya and that's how our first argument begins. 

Naging okay kami and all, ni-visit nya ako (Wednesday) kasi sabi nya he missed me, then may nangyari sa'min, sobrang nakakabigla lahat like hindi ko pa ma function lahat, may part of me na yes, and may part na no. Mahal ko na siya, ramdam ko kaya parang okay sa akin na ibigay yung want nya. Pero tangina kasi nakita ko may tattoo pa ng pangalan ng ex nya sa dibdib. Nag lie pa siya nung una sabi nya birthday ng parents niya. 

Then nung last meet namin (Friday), he offered na ihatid ako gamit yung montero. Tapos sabi nya hindi pa siya nag breakfast, so sabi ko kain muna siya kasi nag aayos pa ako. Sabi nya wait nya ako, then medyo na off na ko kasi nung nasa Mcdo kami, ako nagbayad ng meal nya (ako hindi kumain kasi nag breakfast na ko sa babay). Then ayon, I offered naman na magpagas kasi kasama workmates ko sa susunduin. Then nung pauwi na, sinundo niya kami ulit. Nung naiwan na kami, kumain kami, siya nag pick nang kakainan namin. Nung bill out na nakakahiya mga baks kulang pala pera nya, so ako yung nagbayad  ng meal (kahit coffee lang talaga order ko, siya yung kumain talaga). Sa akin, okay lang yon dahil parang out of love kaya nagawa ko. Kaso nung ni kwento ko sa mga friends ko pina realize nila kung gaano ako katanga kasi oo nga pala MANLILIGAW nga pala siya. 

After all na ginagawa nya, I understand him na lang kahit disappointed na ko. I even took pills kaya sobrang moody ako. Then on Sunday night ng same week na may nangyari samin and yungpasundo at hatid nya sakin, sabi nya gusto nya ng space from me. Sabi ko ayoko kasi pwede naman siya magpahinga with me. Pero he's insisting na need nya ng space dahil sa argument and disagreement namin sa isang bagay. Take note nanliligaw pa lang sya pero bakit kailangan nya ng space, I felt like ako naghahabol now. 


Then I sent him a long message telling all the thoughts and feelings I felt. No response, then I saw na he unfriended me sa FB. He also unfollowed me sa IG. 

Then ni kwento ko everything sa mga friends ko, then they stalked him, ni-add nya pala yung isa kong friend pero matagal na yung friend request. Then I told her na i-accept nya, tapos i check namin kung mag me message. Then boom, nag-message nga. 


I got love bombed, and manipulated by lies. Actually, he lied and nagpataas pa siya ng ego like sabi nya nag wo work daw sya as part time engineer pero wala naman sya binabanggit na updates sakin HAHAHA. Funny lang kasi nagbulag bulagan ako sa lahat. I regret everything. Nakakahiya lang na pumatol ako sa taong kagaya nya. 

And now naghahasik na naman sya ng bagong i-cha chat at i-add. Baka ma victim kayo ha. Ingat, gurls! Learn from me. I have so much details na gusto sabihin pero hanggang dito na lang muna.

1hdw8xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1hdw8xh/should_i_just_call_it_quits_and_kill_myself/,Should i just call it quits and kill myself?,"First off, I'm not depressed, I'm well aware of the decision I would be making and the affects it will have.... Hear me out tho, I wouldn't be making my decision from a depressed mindset, nit at all, it's an exhausted, frustrated, unmotivated mind set. I've read a lot of the posts on here and most of them suck ngl, (not tryna have a marble shooting contest tho ijs) however, the one thing that I envy in most if not all of the ones I read is that they have family to talk to, or they lost a job (implying that they had a job to begin with), etc. Well here's a lil bit about myself, I'm 37 years old, I'm a Marine Corps Veteran, I have a bachelor's degree from Full Sail University, have never been arrested or in trouble with the law, I don't have a record at all, I did everything technically the ""right way"", I kept my head down and grinded so that I could make something of myself, have the American dream, etc... Somehow I haven't been able to get a job in my field at all since I graduated which was in 2017, my degree doesn't help, my certifications dont help, the fact that I'm a veteran doesn't even help, I've been driving Uber and Uber eats because I can't get a job no matter where I go even if it's not in my field because: A. I'm over qualified and they're not willing to pay what they think I feel I'm worth, B. They say I don't have enough professional experience but how imma get professional experience if I never get an opportunity, or C. They just not hiring. So essentially I'm broke and I don't mean this new broke where ppl are still able to eat fast food and buy sneakers and stuff, no im literally eating QuickTrip $1 hot dogs just bread and meat cuz I can't afford condiments type broke, and keep in my i served our country and I graduated from college. 

Next I don't have family because they pretty much shunned me from the family because they see me as a joke and they have no respect for me, like how can you respect someone who claims to be a man but has to ask his mom for money cuz he's too broke to buy toilet paper? My step dad told me that i cant have an opinion being broke. Even my own mother thinks I'm a joke she literally laughed at me the last time I saw her because I'm ""still proving Ms. Gwen right"". Ms. Gwen was my 5th grade math teacher who told me in class one day in front of everyone that I ""wouldn't ever amount to anything"". Not to mention every time I would go home for the holidays I would get teased and made fun of for being alone, my brothers, sisters, lil cousins say the same stupid shit, ""why I don't ever see you with a girl? You must be gay or something"". Yea it's dumb but it hits different when you see the lil cousins that weren't even born when you were 10 now married with kids and whatnot. 

While we're on the topic of women and relationships, it goes without saying that im single, I have been for a very very long time, 5 years to be exact, and the only reason for that is because I'm not a provider, and I know what some will say, ""not all women need you to just provide like that"", even tho I don't agree with that I'll reiterate by saying I'M BROKE! Like I can't even meetup for a cup of coffee to get to know a woman broke, I'm literally in debt so every dollar I get is already accounted for, with that being said I can't get any new clothes or haircuts like that, I can barely feed myself, of course I'm not an ideal partner to a woman. Here's the thing that's wild tho, I'm not a bad looking guy, I'm not out of shape, i workout every other day, I'm conscious of how I smell, and I'm conscious about my dental hygiene, but nope can't get a woman to give me the time of day. So obviously there's a sexual frustration element within this situation as well, because I haven't just been single for 5 years, I've been involuntarily celibate for 5 years as well. Think about that, I'm 37 and the last time I engaged in any type of adult intimacy was when I was 31 (it was before my birthday in 2019).

I dont have any friends because most of the people I meet either end up cutting off communication cuz I guess I'm not on their level or they end up starting problems with me by way of blatantly disrespecting me, I get it tho in their head it's them showing ""tough love"" but to me it's just them being a dick and treating me as if I'm less than. I've been living as a recluse from the world the past few years, only having social interactions when I do Uber/ Uber eats, getting hot dogs from QT, or paying bills, other than that it's ""IAmLegend"" just without the dog. Doing Uber helps at night tho because that's when the loneliness really kicks in ya know?

 Oh and I almost forgot to mention, I'm a disabled veteran who suffers with nerve pain, spasms, headaches, etc from nerve damage in my neck, spine, and face. I've gone to plenty of doctors both civilian and military and they all said that they cant seem to see what the problem is, and thats been going on since 2014. I've thought about getting a support animal but decided against it cuz I wouldn't be able to afford taking care of it, I thought about going back into the service but I can't because I'm too old and I'm a disabled veteran, I thought about going back to school but I can't because I don't have any more months left on my GI Bill and if I were to get student loans that would put me in a worse position financially than I already am. So let's recap: I'm 37, no job, no money, no woman, no kids, not having sex, don't own anything, no friends, no family, constantly in pain, and can't seem do anything to change my circumstances. So nothing to lose technically.

 There's a saying, ""control the controllables, well I apply to at least 20 different jobs a day, i go to job fairs, I take new skill certification courses so that I can pad my resume, I even revise my resume using certain keywords that get put on the employers radar to give myself a better chance at being noticed. Hell, I'm not too proud to work at Popeyes right now tbh, however it's ashame that I spent all my GI Bill and time going to college to end up working at Popeyes or McDonald's, etc but if that's what I got to do to get me to the next step of my life then so be it.

 I'm just tired because I've been living like this for way too long, I've been living like I'm on lockdown long before covid happened, I'm a man and I want the things that all men want. I want to feel useful, like I have a purpose in life, I want a family, I want a house or a place of my own, I want people to care for and to care about that care for and about me as well. 

So this is where the question comes in, because I made a vow to myself that if by then end of this year I'm in the same place financially, romantically, and so on, I would end my life because at the end of the day the juice is just not worth the squeeze, this life ain't worth living no more, but towards November I began feeling like I can do more, I haven't done all that I can just yet, idk what more I can do but I just felt like I haven't done all I can just yet. So I reneged on the vow and decided to postpone it until the end of next year, but tbh I don't think i can do another year like this, seriously it's taking a toll on my mental health, plus loneliness tends to physically hurt sometimes, and like I said I'm up during the day filling out applications, taking courses, working on my portfolio and my resume, and then at night I'm doing Uber eats because a empty bed is like a plague for a man in his mid 30s, so it goes without saying that i don't sleep much or at all most nights. I stay up days at a time so yea I'm pretty sure I got some health stuff going on too cuz this ain't a new phase I been staying up nights on end for years. 

Like I said i feel like I did things the ""right way"" so why am I not succeeding at life even in the slightest? I'm tired of being a joke, I'm tired of using so much energy to ultimately end up with less than nothing, and I'm tired of being alone. Like I said I'm not depressed because I know what will fix all my problems and that is, gainful employment with a liveable salary, once that's done everything else will fall into place, I just cant seem to get a chance. Oh and just in case your wondering, i don't think my appearance has anything to do with me not getting a job because I havent even been able to get a call back or interview, so essentially employers just seem me on paper and on paper im like the fucking Dos Equis guy, no kiddin, I got so much work experience from different things i did back before I joined the military it's ridiculous. I once worked at Disney World from 2006 - 2008, so a Disney employee, United States Marine, and a Full Sail University alumni, that's like having a bronze star, Navy Cross, and Medal of Honor in your military jacket and thats just 3 of the things on my resume. So with that said, I ask again, should I just call it quits and kill myself, because I been asking myself that since 2019 and I keep giving myself a chance out of optimism thinking that things are gonna change, all I gotta do is work harder than before, but it seems obvious nothings gonna change and I'm slowly but surely starting to accept that as reality, especially when I'm seeing others including members of my own family eclipse and surpass me while not working nearly as hard nor having to put in nearly as much effort. I'm at the point where I just don't feel like trying anymore. ",1,1734155217.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

1hdw7dt,https://i.redd.it/zyt6aana5r6e1.jpeg,Why are motion graphics effective for marketing?,"‚ÄúWhy Motion Graphics Are the Marketing MVPs (Most Valuable Pixels)‚Äù

The ""Whoa, Did You See That?"" Factor
Let‚Äôs face it: marketing today is like a speed dating event with your audience‚Äôs attention span. You have seconds‚ÄîSECONDS‚Äîto make them fall in love. And that‚Äôs where motion graphics come in. They‚Äôre like the marketing equivalent of showing up to the date in a tuxedo while juggling flaming swords. Suddenly, everyone‚Äôs leaning in, saying, ‚ÄúWhoa, did you see that?‚Äù Static images? Meh. But moving visuals? Now we‚Äôre talking!

Storytelling on Steroids
People don‚Äôt buy products‚Äîthey buy stories. But here‚Äôs the thing: stories can get boring if told the same old way. Enter motion graphics, the caffeinated storyteller of the marketing world. Want to explain your complex product? BOOM! Add dynamic charts, playful transitions, and flying text. In 30 seconds, you‚Äôve transformed your pitch into a Netflix-worthy mini-series. Motion graphics make sure your story doesn‚Äôt just get told‚Äîit gets remembered.

The Scroll-Stopping Superpower
You know that endless social media scroll where your thumb is basically running a marathon? Motion graphics are like throwing a banana peel on that track. They make people STOP. Whether it‚Äôs an animated logo, a snazzy explainer video, or a product reveal with the drama of a blockbuster trailer, motion graphics scream, ‚ÄúHey! Look at me!‚Äù And in a world of infinite content, being seen is half the battle.

 Versatility? Oh, They‚Äôve Got That Covered
Need an ad for Instagram? Motion graphics. A product demo for your website? Motion graphics. A giant LED display at a conference? You guessed it‚Äîmotion graphics. They‚Äôre the Swiss Army knife of marketing tools, working just as well on a tiny smartphone screen as they do on a Times Square billboard. Seriously, is there anything they can‚Äôt do? (Well, except maybe bring you coffee, but give it time.)

 ROI: Really Outstanding Impact
Let‚Äôs talk money. Investing in motion graphics may sound fancy, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthey pay for themselves. Higher engagement, more shares, and better brand recall? Yes, please! Plus, a single motion graphic can be repurposed across platforms. One video, infinite possibilities. It‚Äôs like the gift that keeps on giving‚Äîexcept instead of socks, it‚Äôs skyrocketing ROI.

 The ""Fun + Facts"" Formula
Motion graphics aren‚Äôt just flashy; they‚Äôre also functional. They simplify the complex, turning boring data into bite-sized bits of brilliance. Imagine explaining your business stats with dancing bar graphs or a timeline that literally moves through history. Suddenly, even Susan from accounting is watching your video instead of checking emails.


So why are motion graphics so effective for marketing? 
Because they‚Äôre everything modern audiences crave: quick, engaging, visually stunning, and packed with information. They‚Äôre the life of the marketing party‚Äîthe DJ, the dance floor, and the confetti cannon all rolled into one.

Now, go grab some motion graphics and watch your brand glow up. Because static marketing is so last century, and you deserve better!

1hdw44q,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Few-Weird5586/comments/1hdw44q/im_no_contact_with_my_parents_cuz_they_threw_a/,I'm no contact with my parents cuz they threw a hissy fit,"Okay this is going to be a whole saga. To start this off, I (30f) and my husband (30m) have been married for 2 years, and something to add to that, I am white and he is black. We love each other, and that's all that matters.

The players in this game are:
Mother (61f) - My mother
Father (59m)- My father
Sister (31f)- My sister
Renee (30f)- My best friend of 20 years
Dylan (M) - My BIL's best friend, and a complete AH.
**all of these people are white

And, I'll be honest, I've never liked Dylan. He's a jerk, loud, obnoxious, and he definitely says some stupid and racist things. The fact that at my Sister's wedding (6 years ago), he had to be warned not to saying anything out of pocket to the maid of honor, or her kids, who are all black. Amazingly, he did behave, but still.

** Please note, I live 15 hours away from everyone listed above. I do not see any of them but once or twice a year for a week or two.

So, this starts back around Christmas 2023. Renee was complaining about Dylans excessive cursing and his excessive use of the N word. She then told my husband and I about a comment that Dylan had made during a get together with my parents, sister's family, Renee's family, and some of my sisters friends. The comment was ""The only reason white girls get with black guys, is because they are wh*res"". In front of friends and family. Renee's husband, J, even followed my Mother inside after the comment was made and asked ""he does realize your daughter is married to a black man, right?"" And Mother just said ""He (Dylan) is just an Ass.""

 Which definitely didn't give me good feelings, nor my husband. And though the comment was not made about my husband and I specifically, it still didn't sit right with us. It's also not the worst thing Dylan has ever said.

So because only Renee and her husband told us about this, my husband and I decided we just didn't want to be around Dylan. Honestly we didn't see him often, so it wouldn't be a huge deal anyways. Again, we only visit a few times a year. 

So in March 2024, I flew down for Renee's birthday and I explained to my sister, that if we were ever at her house and Dylan showed up, we would just excuse ourselves and leave. My sister kind of brushed it under the rug and made excuses, but we moved on. I flew home and told my husband how the conversation went. 

 Fast forward to June 2024, my cousin was getting married (about 12 hours away from us) so we drove down to visit family, including my parents and sisters family. While visiting for the wedding, my husband forgot about our conversation about Dylan and my sister from back in March, and he brought it up to my sister again. He apologized for his memory and we moved on.

Apparently, my sister did not and went on her own investigation as to what happened. Because ""she wanted us to feel comfortable"". So she asked everyone that was there, including Dylan, if anyone heard him say that. *Sister asked everyone that was there, except Renee or her husband. And Dylan says he would never say such a thing. And that he doesn't even know me or my husband (true, we don't like him or spend time with him. Nor was the comment made about us specifically)

So, on father's day, my father called my husband and told him that Father never heard anything (highly probable, my father is very deaf, he probably didn't hear anything). My husband explained that we weren't upset with anyone, we just didn't want to be around Dylan anymore. The conversation ended.

Jump to August (8/13/24), I get a call from my Mother. She explains that she and my father will not be attending Renee's son's birthday party. They are upset with Renee because she told us about what Dylan said. Okay? If we aren't mad, why are you? 

Several hours later, my father calls me saying Renee is driving a wedge between us and she's causing problems. And they are my real family. Okay? If we aren't mad, why are you??

So after the conversation with my father, I called my sister, because I have no idea why they are so upset. Basically they are upset because Renee is a liar and no one heard Dylan say anything. And Renee shouldn't have told me anything to begin with. And also Dylan is such ""a great guy and he didn't say it about me and my husband. Renee is dramatic. And the N word is used colloquially now, so it's not that bad of a word anymore"" (to some the N word is nothing, to me it's a racial slur) Renee had a problem with Dylans constant use of the N word, she doesn't want to have to explain that to her young child (5)

Next day (8/14/24), I call Renee cuz I'm now just angry at this situation. They have known her for 20 years! Since she was 10 years old, have been to graduation, wedding, baby shower. All that jazz and couldn't be bothered to talk to her?? So I call her and tell her all of the mess of the night before.  She had no idea anyone was upset with her. On top of all of that, Mother had sent her a text to tell Renee that ""They (Mother and Father) would be out of town for Renee's son's birthday party"" which was a lie! Instead of taking the time to talk out their anger towards Renee, they chose to lie. But are mad at Renee for telling lies about them?

All of these texts are direct copies, only changes are names for privacy 
So I proceed to send this text to my parents in a group text:
(8/14/24)
""Hey yall,
I was thinking about what both of you said after we talked, you said that Renee was trying to drive a wedge between us. After thinking about it, it made me feel that I am being made to choose between yall and Renee. That being said, I think it would be more beneficial If you guys and Renee had a conversation about the situation about how you feel. ""

Mother 8/14/24: have her call me
Father 8/16/24 8:19am: why do you feel like you're being made to choose?

I told Renee to set up a time, she said she would. And I got busy with work and a friend had a baby so I went to visit and got distracted. I forgot to reply to my father. Whoops my bad.

At like midnight my dad replies back(8/19/24) 11:41pm:
""Me or your mother have never done anything to you or your friend, both of you treat us like s***, what comes around goes around!!""

I have no idea what provoked him, so I called Renee (yes at like midnight) and she hadn't talked to my parents yet. We have no idea what happened.

So, I didn't reply to that, I'm not dealing with his anger. At like 1pm he replies to the group chat (8/17/24) 1:16pm:

Father: ""A (Me) there is no reason for us to talk to Renee, she told lies about us, and you have made your choice""
 Immediately followed up with :
Father: ""I hope Kiddo (Renee's son) gets a good friend like Renee and he treats Renee and J (her husband) this way""

So, I didn't say anything to them for like 5 days. I didn't want to speak to them. Spoke a bit with renee and my sister. My sister isn't going to do anything because she ""just makes things worse"" so ultimately, I decided to go No Contact with my parents

On 8/23/24, I sent them a long text basically stating that none of this was necessary and all they had to say was ""we just want to say we didn't hear Dylan say anything. But we want you to know that we don't believe in what he says and we love and support you and Husband"". I also told them that until they receive therapy and anger management, I don't want to speak with them. 

So I sent the text and blocked them, on a Friday. And had a very quiet weekend. Until Monday 8/26/24...

When my father decided to dig up a very old group text message that my husband and I used years ago to update our families when we would be traveling long distances (again, I live 10+ hours away, several states away, so we would send texts when we would get to a new state or a gas stop etc. Now we use location sharing). In this text group, it included Mother, Father, Sister, Renee, and my MIL and BIL.  He basically was trying to talk to Renee saying that he remember when Dylan was ""dogging her out, J (Renee's husband) was standing right behind you listening. He didn't follow Mother into the house, because he's a P****, couldn't even stand up to his wife.""

Keep in mind, I have my parents blocked, so I didn't see it. And for whatever reason, my husband was left off the message (probably because we were in the same car), so my husband only found out from my BIL. So now my husbands family is now dragged into it. So he went and explained what was going on and they were obviously horrified at their behavior. I also sent a message to my sister asking her to speak to him about sending hateful texts to group texts with people he didn't know, because Husbands mother and brother saw that. It was radio silence. 

Honestly I think he realized his mistake and is now very embarrassed (will he apologize? Of course not) so he's been quiet.

Labor Day weekend Renee's husband J flew out to visit Husband and I and we went to a concert together in our state. Great time all around. Also marks that in the 6 years I've lived out here, Renee and her husband have both visited at least once, and my parents and Sister have visited not at all.

So things quieted down quite a bit for several weeks. My husband and I took a trip with friends and it landed around my birthday. On the way back from the trip (9/15/2024), my sister video calls me to wish my a happy birthday with my Niblings...however my mother was also on the call. I did speak to them cordially but ended the call in about 3 minutes and that was mostly for my nephews benefit, he doesn't need to see all this drama. My sister tries to call back, but I didn't answer. 

I take a few days (9/20/24) and send her a text:
""Hey, just wanted to say thank you for the birthday call. But, just to let you know, I have gone No Contact with our parents. So I would appreciate next time we call and talk, to not have mom or dad around. I do not want to see or talk to them. I'm still fine with talking to you and the kids.""

She sent back a ""Okay *sad emoji*""

Around the same time, I received a birthday card from my Mother, which I promptly sent back Return to Sender. 

Silence until October 7, I get a voicemail from my Mother. ""Yeah I got your birthday card back. Did you return it or do I have the wrong address? Please let me know. Love you. Bye""

I did not respond. Also, she's blocked, I only get her voicemails after she sends them.
She also left a 1 second voicemail and a 4 second voicemail of silence.

Now, Renee and I are going to a concert (preplanned over a year in advance) and I had originally planned to stay with my parents, but obviously changed those plans. I am driving the 10+ hours down to my home town for this concert, and they do know that, but they don't know when I plan to actually be down there.

Then on 10/18/24, I get a message from my grandfather (mom's dad), sayings he's at my parents house and would love to see me.

I reply back saying I'd love to see him, but I won't be down for about another week. Also that I'd love to grab coffee with him, but I won't be seeing my parents.

He replies back ""We are leaving Monday for home . Just saying the best way to solve a difference is to set down and talk about any problem you may have!!  I know for a fact your mom and dad LOVE YOU very much!!! I think you know that! They have always been there for you and Sister.  Love You Granpa""

So as respectfully as possible without divulging all the details to him:
""Sorry I don't get to see you, but please be safe going home!

And under normal circumstances I would say yes to sitting down and talking things out. But things were taken too far. It's become a trend for things to be blown out of proportion and me getting blamed for it. So I removed myself from the situation.

I do love and care about them as well, I'm just choosing peace for myself. And I did tell them what steps they would need to take to build a relationship again. 

Love you Granpa""

And I've talked all of this over with Renee through all of it. But my trip is getting closer! And Renee and I have already discussed having a game night and inviting my sister and her kids to come over to Renee's house (because I will not go to Sister's house). So Renee invited her, but did not Include that I'd be there too, and Sister answered back and kinda gave a brush off of ""well there's supposed to be a Halloween party, so idk"" so after a bit Renee did mention I would be there, and of course her tune changes almost immediately ""oh! Well let me double check dates!""

Within minutes of that, my mother reacted to a Facebook message that Renee had sent months ago, near the beginning of all this mess.  And almost immediately my mother deleted that reaction (picture, thumbs up emoji üëç )

So we are thinking Sister is feeding Parents information. And I believe Mother was debating on contacting Renee.

Renee and I are both in agreement that we don't want to speak to my parents until they both go to therapy and we need to find where wires were crossed. Sister painted Renee as a liar (and Renee is not a liar, she'd own up to whatever she says) and never confirmed anything. 

So this is where I am at for now, no idea how this trip home is gonna go. I am not telling anyone where I am staying. We are warning Sister that if my parents show up, especially at Renee's house, the police will be called and they will be trespassed. 

*Renee has read over all of this and approves*

I‚Äôm a 33-year-old man based in the beautiful Seattle/Puget Sound area, looking for someone who‚Äôs not only kind and adventurous but also shares my passions. I‚Äôd love to start off slow and get to know someone whose interests align with mine‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs down for impromptu getaways and finding joy in the simple moments.

Photography and motorcycling are two of the biggest cornerstones of my life. I spend a lot of time exploring the world through a camera lens and from the seat of my bike. I dream of finding a partner who would enjoy a leisurely ride over mountain passes, soaking in the scenery, and stopping for photos of breathtaking landscapes. And if motorcycling isn‚Äôt your thing, no worries‚Äîroad trips in the car with great conversation, cozy diners, and discovering hidden gems are just as special to me.

If your idea of fun includes chasing golden-hour sunsets, savoring roadside pie, and creating unforgettable memories, let‚Äôs connect. I‚Äôm looking for someone who values shared experiences, whether it‚Äôs exploring new places or appreciating the beauty of the everyday.

Let‚Äôs take it one adventure at a time and see where the road leads us. Tell me about your favorite scenic spot or a place you‚Äôve always wanted to explore‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear about it.

More than happy to start off slow chatting online or having low-key coffee meet-ups as we get to know each other better.

It's been a wild one, to start. 

I've... Honestly changed so much in the past 4 months, to say the least. 

It was rough starting out. I struggled in social situations and couldn't find my classes. I tried being overly edgy and arrogant, which was probably off putting to some. About 3 weeks in, I felt like a loser, but I decided this: I could either give up or I could put myself out there, change, and have a good time. 

And so I did. And now I have some great friends. Hell, I even hit a frat party. Very fond of the memories of that night. Probably a highlight for me. 

Academically I did very well. I just procrastinate a bit too much. But I've gotten a lot better over the semester, and next semester will be a lot better. I think I also want to try to find a study partner for my classes, someone to bounce ideas off of and commiserate with. But that's something I'll worry about next month (today was the last day, officially). 

Obviously, religion was something that was heavy on my heart this semester. Now that my parents aren't around, did I still go to church? 

Yes. 

Why? I don't know. Because I wanted to, I suppose. It's what I've always done. I've never missed Mass on Sunday, ever. (During the pandemic, the obligation to go to Mass was officially waived by the bishop). And so I go. Every Sunday. 

I do not believe in God. I remember the first time I said that out loud to another person. He was a chill guy I met who asked if I wanted to grab lunch tomorrow. I said yes. We were chatting away, having a great time, and then he hits me with ""so what are your religious beliefs?""

I panicked but played it cool. I forced my self to say ""I do not believe in God."" He was chill about it, very respectful. I must give him that. This man, who did the sign of the cross and said grace before meals with me sitting beside him, was totally chill about it. I respect and appreciate that. 

People don't understand what it's like: to not want to tell your parents you no longer believe in God. But one person did. 

Her name was Aquarius (a pseudonym). I met her one night when she invited my roommate (whom she knew) and I to watch Twilight with her friends. The power crapped out and she left, but asked to stay the night  in our dorm because her roommate had people over. We talked for hours and religion did come up. 

My roommate acted like it was this was some egregious crime that I didn't tell my parents, but Aquarius understood instantly. It was then I knew that I had to keep her in my life, whether platonically or romantically. She is now one of my closest friends. 

And now for something everybody loves to ask me about: dating!

I'm still single. Never kissed a girl. I'm ok with that. When I'm ready I'm ready. When I meet the right person I meet the right person, whether it's tomorrow or in 5 years. I think, if we were close, I'd totally kiss rn. As for sex? Idk. 

Notice how I said person? Yeah... Idk what I am but I ain't straight. I've flirted with guys without hesitation. Just came naturally and I was in the zone. I've also flirted with girls. 

Aquarius swears there is a girl who has a crush on me and has flirted with me. Who? I never did find out. Was it Aquarius, and that was her way of giving me hints? Maybe, maybe not. She has a boyfriend now, so if it was her, I'm out of luck. I hope it was her, though. 

When I found out she had a bf, I was crushed. But he's a cool guy and we're still good friends, so I'm over it. Totally. 

There was one girl I matched with on Hinge who was in class with me. We went out for coffee, talked for 2 hours and had a good time. I texted her a bit later asking if she wanted to hang out again sometime and she was unsure. No biggie. Then she ghosted me. Why? I don't know. I'd like to know, but I suppose it isn't my business. Note to self: be careful when it comes to flirting with classmates. Could get real awkward if it doesn't work out. 

Would I date a man? I don't know. Would I make out with a man? If the physical attraction was there, yes. Fuck I guess I am gay. Or bi. Bicurious is the term I'll use for now. 

It's been suggested to me that I make out with 5 girls and 5 guys and record the results. This is coming from the same friend who suggested we do a fuck ton of Benadryl and record the results. She was being sarcastic, I believe. Or maybe not. 

My mom asked me today ""you aren't gay, are you?"" She also asked what I would do if a guy hit on me. I would be polite but not reciprocate, just as if a woman who hit on me if I wasn't interested in her. (I would also watch the flying pigs in the second scenario /s)

Do I want to date? Yes. But only if it comes about naturally, if that makes sense. I won't deliberately search for a partner. If I naturally meet someone I vibe with, I'll date them. Would I have sex? Idk if I'm ready, so no. Better to wait then to rush into it and regret it. 

Would I hook up with someone? No. If people want to, that's there business. But I'll pass. 

 So what have I learned about myself? I don‚Äôt have it all figured out just yet. I don‚Äôt always know what to do, or what to say. But I‚Äôve improved so much, and I know what I need to improve. Sure, I experienced heartbreak, but that just means I let myself care about someone. I've struggled with that, I'll admit. I don't want people to see the ugly parts of me. 

Anyway. I posted about my highschool graduation a few months ago, and a couple of people asked if I could update them down the road. I figured I should, not only because they took the time to read my story and comment on it, but as a sort of record. Maybe I should journal. 

Anyway, I know I can't possibly fit all the interesting things I've done in her, so if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! 

And to all those who feel like no one understands what it's like, to be homeschooled, to not tell your parents about your religious beliefs because you don't know what will happen - you aren't alone. And you can do great things. ",3,1734154599.0,HomeschoolRecovery,0,1.0,False

1hdvz8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/excatholic/comments/1hdvz8j/i_was_homeschooled_my_whole_life_in_a_catholic/,I was homeschooled my whole life in a Catholic program - here's how my first semester of college went,"It's been a wild one, to start. 

I've... Honestly changed so much in the past 4 months, to say the least. 

It was rough starting out. I struggled in social situations and couldn't find my classes. I tried being overly edgy and arrogant, which was probably off putting to some. About 3 weeks in, I felt like a loser, but I decided this: I could either give up or I could put myself out there, change, and have a good time. 

And so I did. And now I have some great friends. Hell, I even hit a frat party. Very fond of the memories of that night. Probably a highlight for me. 

Academically I did very well. I just procrastinate a bit too much. But I've gotten a lot better over the semester, and next semester will be a lot better. I think I also want to try to find a study partner for my classes, someone to bounce ideas off of and commiserate with. But that's something I'll worry about next month (today was the last day, officially). 

Obviously, religion was something that was heavy on my heart this semester. Now that my parents aren't around, did I still go to church? 

Yes. 

Why? I don't know. Because I wanted to, I suppose. It's what I've always done. I've never missed Mass on Sunday, ever. (During the pandemic, the obligation to go to Mass was officially waived by the bishop). And so I go. Every Sunday. 

I do not believe in God. I remember the first time I said that out loud to another person. He was a chill guy I met who asked if I wanted to grab lunch tomorrow. I said yes. We were chatting away, having a great time, and then he hits me with ""so what are your religious beliefs?""

I panicked but played it cool. I forced my self to say ""I do not believe in God."" He was chill about it, very respectful. I must give him that. This man, who did the sign of the cross and said grace before meals with me sitting beside him, was totally chill about it. I respect and appreciate that. 

People don't understand what it's like: to not want to tell your parents you no longer believe in God. But one person did. 

Her name was Aquarius (a pseudonym). I met her one night when she invited my roommate (whom she knew) and I to watch Twilight with her friends. The power crapped out and she left, but asked to stay the night  in our dorm because her roommate had people over. We talked for hours and religion did come up. 

My roommate acted like it was this was some egregious crime that I didn't tell my parents, but Aquarius understood instantly. It was then I knew that I had to keep her in my life, whether platonically or romantically. She is now one of my closest friends. 

And now for something everybody loves to ask me about: dating!

I'm still single. Never kissed a girl. I'm ok with that. When I'm ready I'm ready. When I meet the right person I meet the right person, whether it's tomorrow or in 5 years. I think, if we were close, I'd totally kiss rn. As for sex? Idk. 

Notice how I said person? Yeah... Idk what I am but I ain't straight. I've flirted with guys without hesitation. Just came naturally and I was in the zone. I've also flirted with girls. 

Aquarius swears there is a girl who has a crush on me and has flirted with me. Who? I never did find out. Was it Aquarius, and that was her way of giving me hints? Maybe, maybe not. She has a boyfriend now, so if it was her, I'm out of luck. I hope it was her, though. 

When I found out she had a bf, I was crushed. But he's a cool guy and we're still good friends, so I'm over it. Totally. 

There was one girl I matched with on Hinge who was in class with me. We went out for coffee, talked for 2 hours and had a good time. I texted her a bit later asking if she wanted to hang out again sometime and she was unsure. No biggie. Then she ghosted me. Why? I don't know. I'd like to know, but I suppose it isn't my business. Note to self: be careful when it comes to flirting with classmates. Could get real awkward if it doesn't work out. 

Would I date a man? I don't know. Would I make out with a man? If the physical attraction was there, yes. Fuck I guess I am gay. Or bi. Bicurious is the term I'll use for now. 

It's been suggested to me that I make out with 5 girls and 5 guys and record the results. This is coming from the same friend who suggested we do a fuck ton of Benadryl and record the results. She was being sarcastic, I believe. Or maybe not. 

My mom asked me today ""you aren't gay, are you?"" She also asked what I would do if a guy hit on me. I would be polite but not reciprocate, just as if a woman who hit on me if I wasn't interested in her. (I would also watch the flying pigs in the second scenario /s)

Do I want to date? Yes. But only if it comes about naturally, if that makes sense. I won't deliberately search for a partner. If I naturally meet someone I vibe with, I'll date them. Would I have sex? Idk if I'm ready, so no. Better to wait then to rush into it and regret it. 

Would I hook up with someone? No. If people want to, that's there business. But I'll pass. 

 So what have I learned about myself? I don‚Äôt have it all figured out just yet. I don‚Äôt always know what to do, or what to say. But I‚Äôve improved so much, and I know what I need to improve. Sure, I experienced heartbreak, but that just means I let myself care about someone. I've struggled with that, I'll admit. I don't want people to see the ugly parts of me. 

Anyway. I posted about my highschool graduation a few months ago, and a couple of people asked if I could update them down the road. I figured I should, not only because they took the time to read my story and comment on it, but as a sort of record. Maybe I should journal. 

Anyway, I know I can't possibly fit all the interesting things I've done in her, so if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! 

And to all those who feel like no one understands what it's like, to be homeschooled, to not tell your parents about your religious beliefs because you don't know what will happen - you aren't alone. And you can do great things. ",3,1734154173.0,excatholic,0,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular cosmetic procedure, and for good reason. Many people want a brighter smile, but what can you expect when you decide to undergo this treatment? Understanding the impact of teeth whitening and what you can see in your before and after results can help you make a more informed decision.

Before diving into results, let's talk about the reasons why many individuals opt for teeth whitening. Common factors include:

- **Staining**: Food and drinks like coffee, tea, or red wine can stain teeth over time.
- **Aging**: As you get older, your teeth naturally lose their brightness.
- **Smoking**: Tobacco use can lead to significant discoloration.

Now, let‚Äôs explore what you can expect when comparing your teeth's appearance before and after whitening. Different methods of whitening may yield different results, but the general benefits are quite similar.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Before Whitening: The Initial State

Before you undergo teeth whitening, your teeth may look dull, yellowed, or stained. This initial state can affect not only your appearance but also your confidence. You may find yourself hiding your smile or feeling self-conscious in social situations. Understanding your starting point is crucial, as it helps set realistic expectations for the outcome.

### After Whitening: Brighter Smiles

Once the whitening process is complete, you can expect noticeable changes. Most people see a significant improvement, often several shades lighter. The specific results can depend on the method you use:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Treatments:** These typically provide the most dramatic results in a single session. You might achieve a brighter smile in just one visit.
- **At-Home Kits:** These can offer good results, though they may take longer and require consistent use over time.
- **Naturally Derived Products:** Some may prefer to use natural methods, like baking soda or activated charcoal, but results vary widely.

Regardless of the method chosen, seeing before and after photos can be incredibly motivating. Such images demonstrate the tangible transformation achievable through teeth whitening. Many patients report a boost in self-esteem and a renewed sense of confidence after the procedure.

### What to Expect After Whitening

Following the whitening treatment, you might notice some temporary side effects. It's important to understand these to prepare yourself:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Sensitivity:** Your teeth may feel more sensitive for a short period.
- **Irritation:** Gums can become irritated if the whitening agent touches them.

This sensitivity often diminishes within a few days. Most importantly, maintaining your newly whitened teeth requires good oral hygiene. Regular brushing and flossing ensure that stains do not return quickly.

### Maintaining Results

After you‚Äôve experienced the transformation of your smile, the next step is maintenance. To preserve your results, consider these tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Avoid Stain-Causing Foods:** Limit your intake of coffee, tea, ketchup, and other staining foods and drinks.
- **Use a Straw:** When consuming beverages that can stain, using a straw can minimize contact with your teeth.
- **Regular Touch-Ups:** Periodic whitening touch-ups can help keep your smile bright.

It's also a good idea to schedule regular dental cleanings. Your dentist can help you keep those pearly whites shining bright.

Understanding the impact of teeth whitening and what the before and after results look like can significantly influence your decision. A brighter smile not only enhances your appearance but can also lift your mood and boost your confidence. With the right expectations and care, your teeth can remain dazzlingly white for a long time. So if you're considering a whitening treatment, remember to consult a dental professional to find the best option for your unique smile!

Common Myths and Facts About Teeth Whitening Treatments
-------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening treatments have gained immense popularity in recent years. With various options available, from home kits to professional treatments, many people are eager to achieve a brighter smile. However, confusion still surrounds the process, leading to several myths. Let‚Äôs explore some common misconceptions alongside the facts about teeth whitening.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth: Teeth Whitening Is Safe for Everyone

It‚Äôs a common belief that every individual can safely undergo teeth whitening treatments. While whitening is generally safe, it is essential to consider certain factors. Those with dental problems such as cavities, gum disease, or sensitive teeth should consult their dentist before proceeding. Pregnant or nursing women should also seek professional advice. Always prioritize your dental health first.

### Myth: Whitening Products Can Damage Your Enamel

Many people fear that teeth whitening will harm their enamel. However, when used correctly, whitening products are safe and effective. Professional treatments often include safeguards against enamel damage. Over-the-counter products contain safe levels of whitening agents that ensure minimal risk. Nonetheless, overuse can lead to sensitivity, so moderation is key.

### Fact: Results Vary from Person to Person

Just as everyone has unique fingerprints, the results of teeth whitening treatments can vary significantly. Factors that influence outcomes include:

- **Severity of Stains:** Deep stains may take longer to lighten compared to surface-level discoloration.
- **Dental Health:** Those with healthy teeth tend to achieve better results.
- **Type of Treatment:** Professional treatments typically provide quicker and more noticeable effects than home kits.

The key is to set realistic expectations. Speak with your dentist to learn what is achievable based on your specific case.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth: You Can Whiten Your Teeth Instantly

While some treatments, like in-office whitening, promise immediate results, it‚Äôs a misconception to think that all whitening methods work this way. Home kits might take several days or weeks of consistent use to achieve visible results. Patience is essential, especially with at-home products. To maintain long-lasting results, consider follow-up treatments or touch-ups defined by your dental professional.

### Fact: Whitening Treatments Do Not Last Forever

It's a common belief that teeth whitening is a one-time solution. In reality, results can fade over time due to various factors, including diet, habits like smoking, and everyday dental care. To prolong your bright smile:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** Coffee, tea, red wine, and dark-colored berries can stain your teeth.
- **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene:** Regular brushing and flossing help keep your smile bright.
- **Schedule Regular Touch-ups:** Depending on your whitening method, periodic visits to your dentist can help maintain brightness.

### Myth: All Whitening Products Are the Same

The market is flooded with various whitening products, leading to the false assumption that they are interchangeable. In truth, products vary significantly in ingredients, strength, and effectiveness. Professional treatments from a dentist typically use more potent agents that deliver quicker, more sustainable results than over-the-counter options. Researching and understanding the differences can save you time and frustration.

### Fact: Sensitivity Is Common but Manageable

Tooth sensitivity is a frequently reported side effect of teeth whitening. This discomfort can arise during or after the treatment, but it tends to be temporary. If you're worried about sensitivity:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Consult Your Dentist:** They may recommend a specific treatment plan to minimize sensitivity.
- **Choose Desensitizing Products:** Use toothpaste and treatments designed for sensitive teeth before and after whitening.
- **Limit Treatment Duration:** Follow the recommended time to avoid overstimulation of the nerves in your teeth.

Teeth whitening can dramatically enhance your smile, but understanding the truths behind common myths is vital for a safe and effective experience. By sieving through these misconceptions, you will be better equipped to make informed decisions about your teeth whitening journey. Always prioritize professional advice and listen to your body‚Äôs needs for optimal results.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can significantly enhance your smile and boost your confidence. As we've discussed, the before and after results can be impressive, often transforming dull, stained teeth into a bright, radiant smile. Understanding the potential impact of these treatments helps you set realistic expectations. It's essential to remember that results can vary based on your dental health, the method used, and the level of staining.

Throughout this article, we've also debunked common myths surrounding teeth whitening treatments. Many people worry about the safety and effectiveness of these procedures, but facts reveal that most options are straightforward and, when done correctly, pose little risk to your dental health. It‚Äôs crucial to opt for treatments backed by professional guidance to ensure a successful outcome.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Whether you're considering over-the-counter whitening products or professional treatments, being informed is key. Knowing the realities of teeth whitening can help you choose the best option for you. The journey to a brighter smile doesn't have to be daunting. With proper care and understanding, you can achieve the stunning results you desire.

Little background, I got some new red wigglers from a friend, since my outdoor bin is the famed Uncle Jim's mix and has lots of thrashy blues, with the goal of keeping an Eisenia Fetida only bin ü§û.

I Read here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234645/#
That earthworms should be more robust and produce more offspring with addition of neem seed (possibly leaf as well)

I run a 50/50 mix of neem/karanja cake meal, so they've both been pressed for their oils and the result is a wonderful fertilizer with other benefits, and karanja has been known to have a certain synergy with neem that isn't important to get in to here.

There is really no telling what difference it makes without a control, I'm just doing this for fun, and because I would rather have a consistent and broken down food source to grow population.  I'm also using all ingredients and amendments I have on hand for/from gardening or otherwise.

~100-150 happy and breeding worms have been kicking it for about a week in the fresh bin with paper/cardboard/bokashi/peat/neem/karanja/oyster/egghshell/crab, and the food they came with.

Now the main caveat here is the use of Camelina (false/wild flax) meal as a protein source instead of soy or corn; which I believe is approved for use in organic crops, but is usually suggested to spray glyphosate before sowing to give the crops the best chance. Glyphosate has been shown to reduce biomass of worms by around the same ranges it's suggested Neem increases biomass and reproduction, and I don't have a test for the camelina I'm using, so I can't say if there are traces of glyphosate.  I'd also wager that biomass is more or less directly tied to increases and decreases in reproduction.  Worst case scenario here is any glyphosate in the Camelina counteracts the benefits of the neem.
*Entirely a null issue if you don't have access to camelina, which most do not given it's recent resurgence for biofuels and feedstock*

I will take pictures mornings and evenings for any changes, no idea if they'll even like this over the couple scraps they have left.

I might need to add more minerals like rock dust or basalt and more oyster shell flour, which helps a lot with any acidity, but this also might be enough with multiple high calcium sources being around 1/3 the mix

I used post-extracted and blended cannabis fines, but dried tea leaves, coffee grounds, or pretty much anything with a decent nitrogen content should suffice here.

The idea with the very dry **green** material is once it gets wet it should essentially start the composting process, ie when we add it to the bin.  Fish meal should also help here.

All materials should be as dry as possible and blended as fine as possible in a food processor or bullet blender.

If making a small batch, you can easily homogenize the mix in the blender, while with a larger batch, you might need a bowl and whisk to mix it all together.

My older (70's) father is almost completely bedridden with a number of ailments, one of them being AML (Acute myeloid leukaemia) which has recently gone into remission, but he's still feeling quite weak and is on oxygen 24/7 due to some lung issues. So he is very much housebound even when he is feeling well enough to get out of bed.

I am asking for some help here because I'm all out of gift ideas for him. I've given him the normal things like blankets, port pillows, socks, coffee mug warmers, magazines, photo albums and videos of our family, fun books to look at while on the toilet (he loves his potty humor), etc. He used to love hunting, fishing, meeting people, shooting guns, drinking coffee, being a former US marine, being very active, and being hands-on, fixing things, etc. He is NOT into reading, puzzles, games, watching tv or movies (unless they are war-related), beer/drinking, golf, any sports, or anything very intellectual or introverted. He'd rather be outside talking to people, getting his hands dirty, fixing or creating something. Unfortunately my parents live in a very rural area with very very few people around. He's lost his teeth and has been waiting for over a year for the VA to provide proper dentures, so fun food items like beef jerky, etc are out.

This dichotomy means that he is extremely bored all of the time - to the point where he is harassing my mom and people on Facebook (and getting kicked off repeatedly for violating their terms of service) just for entertainment - and I was wondering if there was anything interesting that I could give him that I hadn't thought of yet.

The thing is, we‚Äôve only met like a couple of times. And he talks to me different to the other customers. The best way I can describe it is like he‚Äôs talking to a little girl in a candy store even though I‚Äôm in my 20‚Äôs. It‚Äôs not just a flamboyantly gay thing, it seems abnormal, only because it‚Äôs just so over the top. And one day, I said oh hi, and he was stone faced. He didn‚Äôt smile and he said things have been tough and I said oh I‚Äôm sorry. It seemed bipolar, but it was honestly really scary because  before this encounter he was always so gleeful in an alarming way. It disturbed me tbh, and the worst part is I keep thinking about him. I genuinely get nightmares about him and avoid going to that coffee shop now. I don‚Äôt know why he scares me so much but he does. I feel like he‚Äôs going to follow me and try to kill me.

1hdvcc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1hdvcc2/digital_nomading_in_singapore/,digital nomading in singapore,"my [post on bangkok](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1hd6sx4/living_in_bangkok_on_mhcol_budget/) seemed to be helpful to some, so i figured i'd write a similar one for singapore. 

singapore isn't a common digital nomad destination for an obvious reason: it's expensive. but if your budget is flexible, i wouldn't write it off completely. 

i will say upfront that **i don't recommend you live in singapore for long stretches of time as a digital nomad**. however, if you want to see a fascinating part of southeast asia for let's say 1 to 3 months (and it's in your budget), here is how i managed:

## Accommodations US$3k/mo (range: $2k-$4k++/mo)

this is the killer. as a short-term visitor, you cannot sign any long-term lease (legally). you can only stay in what are basically licensed hotels for <3 months. so your only real option is a serviced apartment. anything you see on airbnb is either a serviced apartment with a stupid markup or illegal.

if you look around, you'll be able to find a decent locally run serviced apartment for around $2.5k/mo, but this will be a SMALL closet-sized room, farther from city center. If you go up to $3k/mo, you can find a (still small) room, but in an excellent central location like Tanjong Pagar. this is what i chose since i prioritize location above all else.

$4k/mo+ is where you start seeing nicer rooms, but do not expect lavish or super spacious accommodations here either. if you are open to shared living spaces, you can find places for <$2.5k. as for the upper range, i am just going to start putting ++ because there really isn't an upper bound as far as i can tell lol.

one nice thing is that generally you can expect solid build quality and maintenance everywhere in singapore. things are clean and tidy, and the government even mandates things like periodic AC cleaning. there are exceptions, sure, but they are exceptions, not the norm.

## Food $900/mo ($200-$1k++/mo) 

accommodation aside, **it is entirely possible to live cheaply in Singapore.** 

for example, you can eat at hawker stalls, which are basically highly organized street food centers with excellent hygiene and infrastructure, for roughly US$2-4 per meal. you can get coffee at local kopitiam shops for $.60, although you should expect it to be either loaded with sugar/cream or taste like jet fuel if black (which tbh is fine and necessary some days). 

prices in air conditioned mall food courts are not _that_ much more expensive than in neighboring countries.

as for sit-down places at nicer caf√©s, western restaurants, and the like: i'd say it costs about what it did in sf or nyc in like 2016. so not inexpensive by any means, but not absurdly pricy either. roughly $10-30 for a typical meal, $50+ for a nice dinner out with drinks, dessert, etc. the government has outlawed inflation (kidding ... sort of) so fast food chains will cost roughly what they did pre-pandemic in the US. 

i spent roughly $30/day on food, and i wasn't trying to budget at all. but then again i tend to eat the same thing everyday and don't have particularly expensive tastes. probably 80% of my meals were: 

* chicken and rice with extra chicken, vegetables, and eggs: $6

* saladstop or daily cut: $10-15

* don don donki sushi/sashimi (discounted later in the day) $10-15

* prepared fruit: $3-4  


### Alcohol ??++

the one exception to the above is alcohol. alcohol is pricy. that's because the government doesn't want you to drink. (alcohol is poison!) expect a beer at a typical bar to cost roughly ~US$9-15.

interestingly, perhaps because of how the tax is structured, lower abv beverages (like beer and wine) tend to be more expensive. i noticed that once you get to the upper shelf range for liquor ($60+ per bottle), prices started to become comparable to, sometimes even cheaper than, what i'd expect in a vhcol area in the US.

## Fitness $250/mo

i shelled out for virgin active. is it worth it? eh, it's fine. if you get excited by saunas, classes, pools, salt rooms, and ig shots, then yes. if you care more about functionality, it's decent with some puzzling trade-offs (e.g., buying a bunch of eleiko plates/bars with no platforms, taking out really nice training rig to make useless open space). the nice thing is that i've found that different locations excel at different things, so you can find everything you need if you're willing to move around a bit. 

hot tip: get a letter from your work stating you need to relocate out of singapore for work to cancel before va's 12-week minimum contract period relatively easily. 

if you don't want to shell out for a gym membership, there are TONS of public calisthenics areas (free), and excellent public facilities for pools, tennis courts, an so on (low cost, even for foreigners). because the government wants you to be healthy! 

## Transport $50-100/mo

yes i spent about the same on transport as i do in bangkok. that's because the public transit system (bus, MRT) is excellent and cheap ($<1 per ride), and also because i lived in a central area that i rarely left. 

grabs are not too expensive. for example, it costs roughly $20-30 to get to/from the airport basically anywhere. i joke that the government has declared traffic illegal (a basic Toyota Corolla-ish car can cost upwards $150k++ with all the tariffs/fees in the first year), so getting around by grab/bolt/whatever is a relatively pleasant experience. i know a few people who commute exclusively using rideshares. personally, i don't like being stuck in a car, so i like to walk or take public transit. 

## Other $800/mo (??)

will vary based on your personal situation. usually a good idea to leave some room for recurring expenses, toiletries, meds, and whatnot. for me, it was mostly paying for expensive american health insurance.

## All-in: US$4k-5k++/mo (and why i don't recommend living long-term as a nomad)

again, the bulk of this is going to be your accommodation. and yes, i am well aware this is very much pushing into vhcol territory. that's the main reason i don't recommend living long-term as a nomad. living forever in a serviced apartment doesn't make much money sense, but even if it did for you, you WILL go crazy eventually living out of a hotel room. 

the other reason is the visa situation. even with a fairly generous visa policy for americans (90-days on arrival, theoretically unlimited visits), it is not uncommon to get stopped by immigration if you have too many visits in a short amount of time. and no, singapore is NOT the place to try slipping a hundred to make the problem go away (straight to jail). it is also NOT the place to try visa runs (straight to wherever you just came from).

the last reason is more personal, but singapore does kinda feel like living in a massive, well-run condominium. some people may like that; others might go stir crazy.

## why it could be worth it

imagine some dude takes over a country. he immediately rules with an iron fist: total control of media, jailing opponents and crushing dissent, passing laws that many would consider weirdly invasive in how citizens act, speak, and behave. guy is ""prime minister"" for three decades (no term limits), then ""hands off"" power to someone he essentially selected himself. after that, power goes to his son. 

you've probably heard this story before. this guy's a dictator, right? and we know how those stories end. 

but wait! 

what if i told you, this dictator ... just happened to be a nice guy? or at least, he was super reasonable, thoughtful, and incorruptible in how he ""ruled"" his country. what would that look like? how would that story go? 

that is basically the story of singapore. its origin story is, i think, the only real-world example of a benevolent dictatorship on the books. and for someone who's always been interested in politics/governance, it is fascinating to see and be able to live in the product of that, even for just a few short months. 

other reasons: 

* super safe. leave your laptop on the table at a caf√© to go the bathroom (all day if you wanted) and fully expect it to still be there when you get back.
* super easy <- you hear this a lot from expats. living in singapore is just ""easy"". everything works. 
* everyone speaks english. 
* so easy to meet people and make friends, probably because people are coming and going all the time. 

for me, i just felt ""home"" in singapore unlike anywhere else. it's partly because i haven't been able to find the above combination elsewhere. sure, other places like korea/japan are similarly safe, but not everyone will speak english. and nowadays, what english-speaking country can be considered ""super safe""? 

the other reason, if i'm being perfectly honest, is because as a someone of east asian descent i just blended into society. it's not really something i thought about until i lived in singapore. turns out living with a bunch of people who look like you (and talk like you) is strangely comforting. no one asks where you're from, at least not in a mean way. people just accept you for who you are. you don't feel excluded or feel like an outsider. it's really nice.

so anyway, yes singapore is probably not the best place to stick around as a digital nomad for long bouts of time. if you do want to stick around, you should look into various long-term visa options like i did. in the meantime, hope you get a chance to check it out for yourself!",13,1734151840.0,digitalnomad,5,0.93,False

You say it has nothing to do with me‚Ä¶ but I know it does. I prayed, I tried, I was there. But I wasn‚Äôt enough. I couldn‚Äôt break down the barrier and you found someone else. It hurts for so many reasons. 

This isn‚Äôt just goodbye to you. It‚Äôs goodbye to your parents as well, who I love so dearly. Your dad, who I was so scared yet so eager to meet and talk to. He became a friend (kinda) and someone I wanted to get to know. Someone I was glad to call a father in law. Your mom, who‚Äôs so sweet and kind. Seeing her at Dash-In and how happy she was to see me‚Ä¶ it made me feel like not only had I found my wife, but I thought I had found my family as well. You leaving is also them leaving, and it hurts so much. 

I imagined our wedding. I imagined introducing you to my friends and colleagues and people I‚Äôd invite that you wouldn‚Äôt have met before. I imagined driving with you to different places and laughing. I imagined listening to Birds of a Feather and singing Bodak Yellow at the top of our lungs. I imagined coming home after a long day at work to your beautiful smile and heavenly voice. I imagined adopting a cat and naming him Sobhe because that‚Äôs the name you wanted for him. I imagined getting him a friend named Layli, because it means the exact opposite. I imagined moving into an apartment together. I imagined decorating, and arguing over whether a painting was straight or not, but I would just yield to whatever you say because my home is only happy when you‚Äôre happy in it. 

I knew it would be difficult. My parents are apprehensive, and would be skeptical. But I was prepared to fight for you. If you have me the green light, I would‚Äôve spoken to them, and told them about you and how I want to marry you. I would have told them about how you make me feel, how we have gym sessions together. How you made me want to try harder in my classes and in school. How you made me want to strive for a future so I could provide for you. 

It wasn‚Äôt enough for you I guess. I guess the trust got in the way? The past. The history. I guess I changed internally, but it wasn‚Äôt enough for you to realize it externally. 

I don‚Äôt know how you did it. It all happened so soon‚Ä¶ not even a year and you‚Äôve already fallen for someone else. You‚Äôve already picked someone else. You say it isn‚Äôt about me but how could it not be? If I was enough we would‚Äôve been together. If I was better we would‚Äôve been together. 

I tried to do all I could for you and I still would do so much more. But you‚Äôre traveling tomorrow. You‚Äôre leaving me today. With you, you‚Äôre taking the last 10 months. You‚Äôre taking the parts of me that laughed with you at the gym, the parts of me that ordered you food, the part of me that has your go to coffee order hanging in my car so I could surprise you whenever. I guess I won‚Äôt be needing that anymore‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt throw it away. I can‚Äôt throw anything from you away. With others I could but with you?? You were, you are a piece of my heart. You are my everything. Whether you‚Äôre here or not. I loved you when you weren‚Äôt even in my life. How could I not love you forever?? 

It isn‚Äôt a burning love. It isn‚Äôt a honeymoon love. I‚Äôm past that. It‚Äôs a safety love. It‚Äôs a ‚ÄúI know no matter what, I have you‚Äù love. It was. I thought it would be us against the world, but I feel like it was the world against me‚Ä¶ and I know it will now be that way. 

I told you I wouldn‚Äôt pursue anyone while I‚Äôm in school, and I meant it. But truthfully, I don‚Äôt know if I can ever pursue anyone again. My heart is fixated on you. My brain is a book filled with pages of characters in your life. I know who works with you, who your friends are, your favorite foods, your favorite colors, your future plans, your goals and dreams, the type of house you want (because you hate modern houses). This book has no eraser and the author doesn‚Äôt want to put lead to page anymore. 

So now what?? Now, I do as I did before. I try to fight my emotions, and put on a brave face so no one realizes the pain I‚Äôm going through. I try to keep going, with my studies, with my gym routine, with job applications. Now I try to fill the void that exists in your absence. The time I‚Äôd spend thinking of you, texting you, planning out our future‚Ä¶ now that time needs a new directive. Now, I have to once again isolate myself. I have to once again pretend like everything is okay when it isn‚Äôt. I once again have to pretend like my wins mean something. I once again have to celebrate things on my own, because no one ever cared like you did‚Ä¶ and truthfully I could feel when your care started to disappear. 

2024 was the best year‚Ä¶ until it wasn‚Äôt. Somehow, it was the year you returned, and the year you left. As winter was leaving you came back, and as winter returned, you disappeared, just like a tree. And just like a tree, in my heart you aren‚Äôt dead. In winter you don‚Äôt die. You‚Äôre only dormant. My heart won‚Äôt ever let you go. It will hold on to hopes of a spring that comes back, with beautiful daises blossoming and signaling your return. Maybe you reconsider? Maybe you see how much I mean to you?? Maybe you feel how much you mean to me?? All of my hopes, riding on a shaky and unlikely ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù. 

God is the greatest of planners. This is part of his plan. I wish it wasn‚Äôt. I wish losing you was never written. I wish we could be together. But if god has written your happiness, then that‚Äôs what really matters to me. 

Yomna. I love you. I love you with all of my heart. I don‚Äôt care that you might be pursuing someone else. I can‚Äôt bring myself to hate you. I can only love you. I hate the actions, but I blame myself entirely. It‚Äôs ironic, how even though you left, I blame myself. I hate myself. Because I know that I am the reason you left. I am the reason I lost you. I am the reason I‚Äôll probably end up alone. I could have had you, but I lost you, and I have no idea why. 

In case I never get to say it to you again, I love you so much Yomna ‚ù§Ô∏èyou mean the world to me. I will always be here for you, and I‚Äôll try to live out our plans by myself. But I‚Äôll pretend you‚Äôre there. You might forget me but I‚Äôll never forget you. I promise you I‚Äôll get a cat and name him Sobhe. I‚Äôll get an apartment too. And I‚Äôll fill it with all the gifts you ever got me. Sobhe can play with all of them, even the stuffed animals. I‚Äôll keep adding songs to your playlist. I might even go to a Billie concert because you said you wanted to go to one. I‚Äôll visit Egypt too, and take a tour down the Nile. I‚Äôll learn about the mythology for you. I‚Äôll keep my reminder set for 6 PM for you to take your vitamins. I‚Äôll keep living as if you never left. Because in my heart, you‚Äôll forever hold a space.

I'm starting to plan on converting my Dell Precision 5530 into a Hackintosh, and this is going to be my first time in actually coding + booting into an alien (for me) operating system other than windows.

The reason why I'm converting is for me to transfer music to my ipod 5th gen seamlessly and have the connectivity for airdrops for my iPhone without buying an actual mac. + I've tried using a mac for productivity (from my old job) and its easier there than a windows laptop. (Specifically the color coding on files)

Reason why I don't really need an actual Mac:  
\- laptop resellability is cheap (I don't plan on buying an old mac)  
\- I've upgraded this Laptop to 1TB Storage already + 64GB RAM  
\- The Macs I've seen on this laptops price range is only 120gb storage + 8gb ram

I have done my research (not to much since I can't find my specific problem in some threads) and prepared for the whole conversion, its just that I wanted to ask if I can actually still utilize the QuadroM P2000 GPU on my laptop?

CPU: i7 8850H (Coffee Lake)   
RAM: SK Hynrix 64Gb SoDIMM 2666Mhz DDR4   
MOBO: Dell 0N0DK2 (Latest Bios)

Instead, I observed that the PID immediately shows 205¬∞F as soon as I change the setting from 200¬∞F.



My second question is about the water temperature. After letting the machine heat up for about 30 minutes, I pulled the lever and felt the water coming from the group head. It doesn't feel close to 200¬∞F; I can hold my hand there without any discomfort, and it just feels like a warm shower. I expected the water to be much hotter. I did this test because all my shots are consistently sour, no matter the grind size, dose, or extraction time. The shots looked great and are all within 30 seconds of extraction time. Or does water really cool that much when it passes from the boiler to the group head?

I know this keeps popping up in the group but I couldn't find much  info.

I recently moved to Portland and have been trying to meet new people and make some friends. I‚Äôm in my mid-20s, and while I don‚Äôt drink (so bars aren‚Äôt really my scene), I‚Äôm open to almost any activity.

I‚Äôm super outdoorsy and love exploring nature, though I don‚Äôt have a car yet, so I‚Äôm mostly sticking to places I can reach by public transport or bike. Whether it‚Äôs hiking, biking, coffee meetups, board games, or just exploring the city, I‚Äôm down to join in!

Also, if you know of any good ways to find events, groups, or communities (other than Meetup.org), I‚Äôd love to hear about it. Maybe Reddit groups, Facebook groups, or even local notice boards? Let me know if you have tips or want to hang out!

1hduxtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1hduxtf/wrapped_up_our_2024_hyatt_season/,Wrapped up our 2024 Hyatt Season,"Love reading the recaps and quick reviews of people's 2024 Hyatt Campaign. Please keep sharing them! Here's where my wife and I stayed this year:

**Dream Hollywood**: Big fan. Stayed here like 4x this year because my wife was going to LA for work a lot. Used a SUA the first time and they just kept putting is in the platinum suite which is very nice. They also give you two $10 cookies when you check in. It's a fun little corner in the hellscape of Hollywood. Authentic Chinese food around the corner (Hui Tao Xiang).

**Carmel Valley Ranch:** Beautiful property, great breakfast. We don't golf but could see it being even better if you did. Was undergoing a lot of construction when we went. Also, pretty far from anything.

**Hyatt Regency Seattle:** Best hotel in Seattle! Love the breakfast there. Lots of on-site options, the bar is always lively. Fun fact: We randomly did karaoke with several staff at another bar one night. Fun folks.

**Anndore House (Toronto):** Loved this place. Great on-site restaurant. Amazing staff.  Location is OK, there's stuff, but you're far from the heart of Chrunna. Best part is the unique room designs that I really liked. Didn't feel like a normal hotel.

**Thompson Chicago:** Our go-to when we stay in Chicago. It's nice, decent location and a good breakfast. We've stayed here multiple times over the last several years and it feels like it's ALWAYS under construction.

**Tommie Hollywood:** It's not bad for a small room. We had a top floor room that was marginally bigger than the regular ones. Breakfast is at the coffee counter, but the food was decent. This is right down the street from Dream HW, and around the corner from Thompson HW.

**Thompson Austin:** One of my fav properties. I grew up in Austin and go back often. They always take care of us there and we usually get upgraded to a legit 1 BR apartment (with W/D). The food was incredible (The Grey Diner was opened by Mashama Bailey) but they changed it to bring all the dining in house a few months back so I don't know how it is now. Amazing location (if you don't mind the 6th Street turn up!)

**Hyatt Regency Sacramento:** Not bad. They gave us the suite that used to be the Regency Club which was massive and very nice w/ a view of the state capital. Also delivered on a special request of grilled corn for my wife (it's her fav.) Dawson's restaurant on-site is nice and a fun vibe.

**Everline Resort (Lake Tahoe):** Beautiful property with tons of on-site amenities. Great gym/spa setup. Breakfast buffet was actually high quality. Multiple pools with a water slide! We don't have kids but they have a cool looking kids play area. Pretty far from everything except Olympic Village.

**Andaz Scottsdale:** I've said it before here but this might be my favorite Hyatt in the US. Just all around fantastic. 10\* Great pools, on-site activities most days, proper gym/spa, free rides into Scottsdale + golf cart rides up to the main road where there's a lot of options.

**Hyatt Regency LAX:** Stayed here one night for a short trip to LA. It was under construction so not a lot on-site but the bar was popping on check out day. I had a cool room where I could see the runways. Not much nearby but other hotels.

**Hyatt House Southside (Pittsburgh):** Hated this place. It was just mediocre in general. Sparsely decorated/designed. Uncomfy bed/pillows. Location was okay but it takes a while to get to downtown. Pretty crappy bar. Got in a fight with the bartender for joking about a UTI when someone ordered a vodka cran. *I was in the wrong, for sure.*

**Hyatt Place Boise:** Loved it! Great room, great gym, not much on-site besides a pool. Breakfast buffet is basic, but the location is amazing. Right on the edge of downtown so much cool stuff within 2-8 blocks.

**Hyatt Centric Honolulu:** Stayed here many times, it's a solid if fairly basic hotel. Sucks they didn't reopen the restaurant/bar after covid. Good location a long block off the main strip there in Waikiki.

**Hyatt Place Braintree (Boston):** Really great property for \~$100/nt. Good gym, **indoor pool**! Breakfast is basic, but the staff really makes this place. Some of the best I've encountered in a non-luxury Hyatt. Attached to a Legal Seafood with a solid happy hour.

**Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor:** It's a solid property, what you'd expect, but is on the airport side of the water so had to time travel into the city proper. Good breakfast, lobster bennie! Nice large gym that looks out at the water. Rooms either face the airport or the city so views are pretty good.

**Hyatt Regency Jacksonville:** Used a SUA and had a very large room. It was definitely a bit under-loved but nothing that impacted our stay. The club was closed for renovations which sucked, but the breakfast was great and the hotel bar is top notch. It's where all the airlines stay, so there's always pilots and/or FAs there. Saw Trevor Lawrence there. Not much around it, but it's on the water so good for a morning walk.

**Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht:** Just a whole vibe. Gorgeous and maybe the nicest Andaz I've stayed at in terms of just feeling luxurious. Great location, amazing breakfast, gym is kind of small. 

**Grand Hyatt Athens:** Liked it well enough. Another SUA so we had a massive living room but it was very lightly furnished. Staff is nice, the location is okay (it's fantastic if you're interested in Athens' adult nightlife.) The lounge was large w/ drinks + snacks. Gym was awesome and the spa was fantastic. Indoor pool + spa + cold plunge. Breakfast on the 9th floor with views of the Acropolis was rad, too.

All totaled, 112 nights in Hyatt this year. Looking forward to wherever we go next year!

We don‚Äôt need to have the same interests and hobbies, since these change over time. What‚Äôs more important for me is interest in spending time together to get to know each other.

Me: 5‚Äô2‚Äù, average weight, active, not bad looking I‚Äôd say, we‚Äôll see if we‚Äôre each other‚Äôs cup of tea when we meet. Has a growth mindset. Travelled here and there.

My friends invited my fianc√© and I to join last June 2024 and there was a total of 10 people total. I had high hopes going in but lately I am riddled with anxiety every time I have to attend. At first everything was fine but there is this girl who I will call Leah. Shes a huge smart ass and talks down to people and acted like she was in charge all the time. She made a racist comment about the shade of brown her coffee was, stating she wanted her coffee to contemplate murder but not commit it. And says she can say that because she isn't all white. I say that's beside the point it was a racist comment tp make. She retaliates and says I was being racist because in our champaign in character I called my fianc√©'s character bird man, he is playing a kenku who is a raven humanoid. 

I offered to make dinner one time, and she texted me the day off asking me if I was planning in making my pasta dish (mind you we aren't playing at her house, and I asked the person who house it belonged to if I could bring food). I told her yes and thought that was the end of it. She asks me if I bought stuff to make it and she then proceeds to tell me that my pasta dish wouldn't make it easy to roll dice and eat pasta at the same time. She then asks if I wanted to colab with her pork sandwiches that she was making. I was already having a stressful day and dealing with my feelings after cutting off contact my paternal grandmother. I told her no to purchasing the items to make it and she can make her pork sandwich dish and said yes I eat pork. I then told her I was going to bring my dish next session regaurdless. Around this time our DM and Leah started dating and made it known my her going up to him and groping his chest infornt of evderyone and two of her cousins. When I found out they were I had this feeling that she was just going to get her way the entire time.

The DM makes and announcement to the group saying that if we have a disagreement amounts each other to come to him so he could mediate. Referring to the conversation and askes ""who is bringing food next"" and Leah and I had. She then very loudly says ""what side would go best with your pasta dish"" I felt so humiliated by this. This is how the food rotation came into place. 

  
By this point she has talked to me like a child. Whenever I do something like fidget or mumble or share something I've done she would always respond with ""are you ok?"" is a very judge tone. I was talking about how I went to a Sponge Bob rave with my friends, and we dressed up, I was mermaid man, and my friend was barnacle boy. I showed her a photo of my friend and I and referred to her as my girlfriend and she went ""oooh girlfriend"" in like a oh your kind of fruity, mind you I'm sitting next to my male fianc√© with my leg draped over his. Like no I very clearly meant it as a friend and when she sees the photo of us, she sneered and just said ""are you ok?""

  
Like are you really going to judge me for going to a sponge bob rave and dressing up? We're playing dungeons and dragons right now! I have ADHD and I am prone to fidgeting and mumbling. And every time she catches me, she does the condescending are you ok bullshit. 

Another instance was when her younger cousin (18 male) and my fianc√© (23 male) went to go check out something in the bathroom. I pointed out how oddly shaped the bathtub was to the owner Gem (21 female). The boys went to go and check it out and Leah looks at me and asks if I'm sure my fianc√© isn't gay. I was caught off guard and annoyed. Like are really making a gay joke of your just turned 18-year-old cousin who just graduated high school and a 23-year-old straight engaged man. 

At this point I was getting fed up and it wasn't helping that my fianc√© and Peter kept on saying she probably doesn't mean to be rude to me. They weren't taking my side that she was being rude to me. I decided to finally talk to the DM because he is her bf and idk if he would hear me out basically. I told him I've been contemplating quitting because of how Leah has been treating me and making me feel. I told him I was worried about going to him before because I didn't want to cause more drama for the group and he was her boyfriend. His responce was better than expected and told me that he didn't want to leave and said he would mention this to Lea. He tells me she wasn't aware and wanted to meet up and apologize. Well we did and she just trauma dumped on me the entire time. I desided to be vaulnerable and share how I felt about the comments she made about me. But everytime I did she would just share something horrible that happened to her. Her reason for asking me ""are you ok"" was beause her sister has BPD and said she was just looking out for me. Like WTF?!?!? I was diagnosed for ADHD when I was 12 and have fianlly come to terms with myself on it and being on medication for it. I was appreciative of the apology but I felt like my point ever got accross and our DM was there to mediate the conversation but he just sat there. 

It's important to note that I am white and can be mistaken with every other white, blonde lady. I am Jewish and had mentioned it one time at a session which led to Leah asking me all the time exactly like this ""because you are Jewish do you eat pork"" at the very beginning of the champaign it was made aware to the group that I was lactose intolerant and Gem has celiacs disease and to keep those in mind for bringing food. I eat pork and have eaten pork in front of her. My last stray was this, she tells me I need to bring my lactate because the food she was bringing was all dairy. And then proceeds to apologize about not knowing how to make anything without dairy in it and how it's not intentional. And then asks to collaborate with her so she can figure out what to make that I can eat. She also asked me if since I am Jewish do I eat pork.

  
I feel trapped, I want to keep playing but she keeps insulting me and she gets favored all the time during our sessions. She yells at everyone, she never gets attacked in the game and since June ger character has been getting more attention while my fianc√©, Peter and I almost die each session. I am unfortunately used to being disrupted, undermined and manipulated into being ungrateful my entire life. On the outside I look like I come from the stereotypical nuclear family.

Excited to say I am heading to Iceland very soon :) kind of a weird question but I live off of iced coffee and cold brew, and was wondering if there are any places yall recommend? The last post I saw on this topic was from 2 years ago so I‚Äôm curious if there are any updated recommendations or new places that have popped up since then. 

As a little bonus question, if you had to choose between scuba diving at silfra or horseback riding which would you do? I have one free day  and can‚Äôt decide ü´† Thank you! ",3,1734149733.0,VisitingIceland,2,1.0,False
