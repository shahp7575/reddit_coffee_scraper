1hfyj7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hfyj7b/make_sure_you_enjoy_your_vacation/,Make sure you enjoy your Vacation! :) ,"Hello everyone,

I looked around on Reddit, but I couldn't find any specific forum, so I'm making a post here to ask for your advice.

I'm a male in my 20s, currently working in aviation in Europe, and I just broke up with my ex (female, also in her 20s) due to a lot of disagreements, mainly about finances.

A bit of backstory (I'll keep it somewhat vague to protect my privacy, of course):  
We met over the internet last summer when she texted me through an app in 2023. We started chatting, got interested in each other right away, and after a few months of texting, I decided to fly to her country to meet her. I spent a week there, and while some moments were pleasant, we also had some serious discussions too, mainly about the future. Since I was serious about the relationship from the start and, I wanted to know how my partner viewed certain aspects of life.

Our disagreements were mostly about finances. In her country, men are expected to pay for everything, there's no concept of any kind of 50/50, even as friends. Men are also expected to have a house before proposing, get down on one knee, no sex before marriage, etc. You get the point.

Anyway, I shared my views as well. Being an immigrant myself and having the same shit on going back home but growing up in Europe since I was a child, I see things differently. I value equality¬†**A LOT**. Since she moved to Europe this September, I did a lot to help her. I gave her and her best friend my travel benefits through my airline so they wouldn't have to spend money on flights. I tried to ease some of her financial stress by anticipating admission fees for various universities across the country. I got half of it back, but she still owes me some money. It‚Äôs not a huge amount, but it‚Äôs symbolic.

I drove around the city where she eventually decided to study, looked for apartments for her and her best friend, and talked to the owners since people here don‚Äôt really speak English. Once she arrived, we lived in almost the same city, I'm closer to the airport for work, and she lives closer to the university.

During her time here, I showed her love and understanding. She wanted to visit certain places, we did. She wanted to try new foods, we did. She would send me Instagram reels of things she wanted to experience, and we tried those too, all at my expense of course. I even took her some famous spots in the county and in the mountains for her birthday and celebrated at a Michelin star restaurant because she loved the view from its window, surprised her with a cake that she knew nothing about while everyone was singing happy birthday.

Yet, despite all of this, she never even bought me a cup of coffee or even ask me. Every time she came to my place, I would pick her up, and she was always hungry so we‚Äôd always go out to get food (again, at my expense). She never cooked at my place except for pancakes once or twice. I mostly cooked and washed the dishes while we talked about shared responsibilities, something she agreed to but never followed through on.

(I realize now that I sound like one of those guys on the internet whose stories I always used to feel sorry for. Funny how life works‚ÄîI‚Äôve become them.)

Anyway, I made sure she had everything she needed to feel comfortable at my place towels, slippers, pajamas, menstrual pads, a teddy bear, fresh sheets, a clean house, and heated house since she‚Äôs always cold. I listened to her vent about her day, her gossip, and her disappointments, and I always gave her feedback.

When it came to intimacy, we could only masturbated each other since she wanted no sex before marriage which I respected because I valued her choices. I always made sure she was pleasured, she was relaxed first. I did all of this only to get broken up with over a¬†**text message**, where she called me ‚Äúungrateful‚Äù for what she‚Äôs done for me.

I never asked for big surprises, gifts, or expensive dinners. I always appreciated small gestures. I just wanted to feel that my partner cared for me too. For example, I didn‚Äôt expect her to take me to a fancy restaurant‚Äîjust buying me a ‚Ç¨1.50 burger from McDonald's or randomly asking if I wanted a coffee would have been enough. I never made her pay for anything, nor did I ask but is it really¬†**too much**¬†to expect some consideration from your partner? She knew about this as i expressed that i want to be treated too sometimes.

She got mad when I pointed out the hypocrisy of her paying for things when she‚Äôs with her girlfriends but refusing to do the same for me. I mean, it‚Äôs okay to treat your friends, but not your partner? Hmm‚Ä¶

After the breakup text, she messaged me to arrange an exchange of belongings. I agreed and asked her for the money she owed me, money she had promised to pay back when she first arrived in Europe (a deadline¬†**she**¬†set for herself). Instead of responding, she blocked me on every social media platform.

There‚Äôs a lot more, but I don‚Äôt want to get too deep into it. If anyone has questions, I‚Äôm happy to answer.

**Now for the main part:**

She recently booked a 3‚Äì4 day vacation with her girlfriends to a beautiful place in Europe. The tickets for their flights are, of course, my travel benefits. My question is:

Should I cancel their flights¬†**before**¬†they depart?  
Or should I cancel¬†**only the return flight**¬†once they‚Äôre already there?

This would be¬†**Phase One**.

**Phase Two**¬†would involve contacting her landlord to explain how, in my view, she used me to settle down here and then decided to cut me off entirely.

The¬†**nuclear phase**¬†would be filing an official complaint with the police, presenting all the proof I have, admission fees I paid, receipts, messages, etc.

1hfygle,https://i.redd.it/ae8kkllp2b7e1.jpeg,Park Hyatt Doha view,"To start off, I will say it‚Äôs overall a ‚Äúgood‚Äù hotel, as in it‚Äôs not cheaply designed, and it has all the basic trappings of a proper higher-end hotel, but it ultimately falls towards the bottom end of all Park Hyatts I‚Äôve stayed at.

Room: the room itself is good enough, they‚Äôre all spacious and well-appointed. Design-wise it‚Äôs fairly uninspired, I could probably transplant this hotel into basically any other large metropolitan and call it a day. Wasn‚Äôt upgraded to a suite despite ample availability, but with a 11pm check-in, I wasn‚Äôt interested in raising it as an issue.

Food: the breakfast one of the weakest I‚Äôve had. There were really only two hot meat options in chicken sausages and veal bacon. Everything else was just cold cuts, salad, bread, cheese, etc. Maybe that‚Äôs good enough for some people, but I didn‚Äôt find much of it to be that interesting. The a la carte menu itself has about 5 or 6 options total, which are all just basic egg dishes. The drink selection is super limited as well, I wasn‚Äôt expecting to get honey taro lattes like PH Jakarta or matcha at PH Auckland, but they didn‚Äôt even have heavy cream for coffee. And also, the coffee was some of the worst I‚Äôve ever drank, super watery and no flavor whatsoever, and I tried everything, iced coffee, Americano, cappuccino, latte, espresso, etc. The food at the restaurants is otherwise all very overpriced for the region and quality is nothing special.

Service: I will never hate on service workers, and I believe the staff were all polite and well-intentioned, but it ultimately made for a lackluster experience since they didn‚Äôt feel proactive or service oriented at all. For example, to even get any water at the start of breakfast, I had to wait five minutes, until I finally was able to flag down a waiter, despite there being only a handful of guests at the time. Service was otherwise also super slow, in total I would maybe only get a sum total of two coffees during a one hour breakfast sitting, and each time I would have to flag someone down myself. On top of that, they would get the drinks mixed up half the time and bring a completely wrong drink. Finally, I was served raw chicken for lunch, and the only service recovery aspect was to bring me a complimentary dessert, which I explicitly said I did not want. In general, there‚Äôs just a huge gap to how service culture is in Asia, where a Hyatt Centric or Regency in Japan would have better service than PH Doha.

Amenities: the gym itself is quite nice (note that they‚Äôre gender separated actually), pool and spa are good enough, all the stuff you‚Äôd expect at a ‚Äúfive-star‚Äù hotel.

Value: this is where I really ding them. I just really can‚Äôt justify staying here at the current cash prices of $200 to $250/night or pay points for a Cat 5. I would rather just spend 5k points/night or half the cash to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Doha, which has better value with the club lounge as well.

Closing thoughts: this really does not live up to the Park Hyatt brand like Jakarta, Bangkok, Auckland, etc. It feels like a Grand Hyatt at best, and perhaps not even with the service quality. I found Grand Hyatt Melbourne to be way nicer than this place could ever be. Overall, I cannot recommend anyone to stay here if you ever happen to be here in Qatar, unless the price was significantly lower somehow.",3,1734396327.0,hyatt,1,1.0,False

Now, were both older and single and decided to talk on the phone. It was PERFECT, great conversation and intense chemistry over the phone. The next day, we decide to meet for coffee and again- a perfect coffee date, with sooo much emotional and physical chemistry. He just says things that I am a little bit concerned about and he's definitely moving fast. We have a lot of similar interests and I really want to like him. We've been talking for 4 days...

1. He's made it known he really wants mixed babies, he says he has baby fever and talks about hypotheticals of how our babies would look, be raised, etc. He wants to be a father, and has talked a lot about how his relationship with his dad was a poor one, and that he really wants to be a great father. I'm in graduate school and have no plans of being anyone's BM anytime soon. ALSO- he's not too concerned about being married before having babies... right...
2. He's telling his friends and coworkers about me (allegedly) and made it known that he's no longer on the apps, he's not talking to anyone else and he's ready to focus on the one. He constantly tells me how this has never happened to him, he's thinking about me all the time, he's ready for me to come to the NYE party and meet everyone he knows.
3. He prayed for me. He's religious, I'm not. He said just a few days before we met, he prayed to god to show him the woman he needs to focus on and devote his life to and then of course we like each other's stories and talk on the phone and now I'm that woman...AGAIN- chemistry and conversation is there, there's just these intense aspects of his intentions with me that are already being brought up and discussed in the first few days of interacting.

It's so confusing, I feel like I may be being love-bombed, but also maybe he just knows what he wants? But how can what he wants be me? He doesn't actually know me... he's so infatuated with me right now and I want to be with him but the above reasons are confusing me. Is it worth hashing out or is he just such a huge red flag? Should I ghost? Does it sound like he just wants pretty little mixed babies from me? We really really get along, BUT ITS ONLY BEEN 4 DAYS. I've been really working on boundaries this year and I feel like he may be the biggest lesson of them all already lol. He's so cute, so sweet, so eloquent but am I being majorly love-bombed?

It‚Äôs been a year since I started Zepbound, and I‚Äôm thrilled to share my updated journey. This is a follow-up from [My Journey with Zepbound: A Six-Month Progress Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1dnt6h0/my_journey_with_zepbound_a_sixmonth_progress/) back in June. From weight loss milestones to lifestyle changes, this year has been transformative. Below, I‚Äôve outlined my progress, challenges, and the cool moments that have made this experience unforgettable. I‚Äôve also included insights into how I approached dose adjustments, side effects, and mental hurdles, hoping this helps others on similar paths.

# Weight Loss Summary

|**Dose**|**Duration (Weeks)**|**Starting Weight**|**Ending Weight**|**Total Loss**|**Average Weekly Loss**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2.5 mg|4 weeks|307.5 lbs|296.1 lbs|11.4 lbs|2.85 lbs|
|5 mg|4 weeks|296.1 lbs|285.8 lbs|10.3 lbs|2.58 lbs|
|7.5 mg|4 weeks|285.8 lbs|273.5 lbs|12.3 lbs|3.08 lbs|
|10 mg|12 weeks|273.5 lbs|244.8 lbs|28.7 lbs|2.39 lbs|
|12.5 mg|28 weeks|244.8 lbs|192.8 lbs|52 lbs|1.86 lbs|

**Total Weight Loss (12 months):**

* **114.7 lbs lost** (from **307.5 lbs** to **192.8 lbs**).
* **Average Weekly Loss:** 2.2 lbs overall.

# Key Trends and Insights

1. **Dose Adjustments:**
   * Every dose adjustment was based solely on my doctor‚Äôs recommendation. I relied on their expertise to guide the timing and progression of my treatment.
2. **Weight Loss Plateaus:**
   * My rate of weight loss slowed at times, especially when I began working out. Mentally, it was challenging because the numbers on the scale didn‚Äôt move as much. However, reminding myself that I was building muscle helped me stay patient.
3. **Milestones Reached:**
   * I‚Äôve hit a lower weight now than I ever remember, even as a teenager.
   * Went from **size 44 pants to size 34** and **2XL shirts to a Large.**
   * Trying on a size 34 pair of jeans for the first time was surreal‚ÄîI‚Äôve never been able to wear that size before. Honestly, it felt like **imposter syndrome.**

# Side Effects and Lifestyle Changes

**Improved Side Effects:**

* **Fatigue:** Fatigue largely faded over time. Shot day (or the day after) can still be tiresome, but it‚Äôs not nearly as bad as it was earlier in the journey.
* **Sulfur Burps:** Haven‚Äôt had these in quite some time.
* **Gastro Issues:** Occasionally deal with gastrointestinal discomfort, sometimes leading to vomiting for relief. Managing this with **Tums** and **omeprazole** has helped significantly.

**Lifestyle Adjustments:**

* **Diet:** My relationship with food has completely changed. I eat because I‚Äôm hungry, not because I‚Äôm bored.
* **Alcohol:** Rarely drink, though I enjoy a glass of Cab every now and then.
* **Coffee:** Occasionally drink coffee, now generally opting for **cold brew.**
* **Activity:** Adding workouts in July helped boost energy, reduce plateaus, and increase confidence.

**Social Impact:**

* My weight loss has given me more confidence overall. It‚Äôs made eating out and attending special occasions much easier‚Äîboth physically and mentally.

# Doctor Collaboration and Health Monitoring

* I‚Äôve worked closely with my doctor throughout this journey, with check-ins every six months. Anytime I had questions or concerns, I reached out via email or phone, and they were always supportive and responsive.
* Recently, bloodwork showed elevated liver enzymes, which I‚Äôll discuss with my doctor at my annual check-up this week.

# Cost and Medication Access

* **Insurance Coverage:**
   * My insurance still does not cover Zepbound.
* **Out-of-Pocket Costs:**
   * $550/month with the savings card, paid via HSA.
* **Access and Shortages:**
   * Despite national shortages, I never missed a dose thanks to careful planning and a backup compounding option through my PCP.

# Personal Reflections

This past year has been a whirlwind of progress and discovery. Losing **114.7 lbs** has completely changed how I see myself and how I engage with the world. From shopping off the rack to fitting into clothes I never thought possible, the physical and emotional rewards have been worth every challenge.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

* Staying consistent during plateaus is key‚Äîprogress sometimes comes in bursts.
* Managing side effects proactively (like using Tums and omeprazole) makes a big difference.
* Weight loss is about more than just the scale; fitting into new clothes and feeling healthier are equally rewarding.
* Monitoring my overall health (like liver enzymes) reminds me this is a marathon, not a sprint.

I hope this update encourages others to stay committed to their journeys. Feel free to ask any questions or share your own experiences‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear them!

Like clean up after him, washing and putting his dishes away and washing, drying, and folding his clothes. Like whenever he calls for me I must immediately drop whatever I am doing and rush to him and do whatever he asks of me. During social event I would have to make tea or coffee and hand out platters of snacks and implied to not sit with any of the guys while they are eating. And that women can only eat after the guys are done, and we should clean up the table for them before eating. 

All of it always made me feel uncomfortable. Like women in general are looked at as lesser? Only there to clean up and cook food and do all the chores while the man works and comes home and watches TV all day. My parents relationship always rubbed me wrong in some way and I can‚Äôt really put it into words. 

Weirder thing is that my mom would instill fear in me like I gotta respect my dad and men and blah blah and then an the same time when he's not at home she calls me ""his dog"" and that I value and respect him so much and uhh implied that I like him in *that* way too which is just... such a disgusting thing to say to your kid. After raising me to respect him in the first place. So yeah, every single thing my parents do make me feel very uncomfortable and demeaned and is this really a cultural thing? It constantly makes me feel like I'm on the verge of throwing up in disgust and shame. Everything they do and say feels so wrong. And 99% of the time every single time my mom speaks- it just makes me feel so angry and distant like I almost cannot believe those are words a real human can say?

Three weeks ago, we talked about it for the first time. Shortly after, he was away for work for two weekends. After his last trip, he talked a lot about a female colleague he had gotten to know better during the trip, even though he had rarely mentioned her before.

A week later, he told me he planned to grab coffee on Sunday with three coworkers. I found that surprising because Sundays are usually reserved for us, and he sees his coworkers every day anyway. Fifteen minutes later, he admitted that he actually planned to meet only this female coworker but was worried I wouldn‚Äôt be okay with it. I was disappointed but told him it was fine.

That Sunday, he left around noon but didn‚Äôt come back until 8 PM. He said they had gone for a long walk and then had wine together. I told him I would‚Äôve appreciated it if he had let me know it was going to be that late. Later, I saw that he messaged her after the meeting saying, ‚ÄúYeah, I thought it was chill too.‚Äù That gave me a bad feeling because, to me, the meeting felt like a date. I brought it up with him, and he admitted it wasn‚Äôt well thought-out.

After that, I noticed they were texting each other every day (I didn‚Äôt read the messages). On Thursday, they went out for lunch together‚Äîshe had already asked him on Sunday, and he said he didn‚Äôt want to cancel because it would have been rude, even though he was on vacation. I couldn‚Äôt understand it, especially since their first meeting had already hurt me, and he himself admitted that it could look like a date from an outsider‚Äôs perspective.

That weekend, he asked me if it was okay to meet her again on Monday after work. After long discussions, I agreed but made it clear I didn‚Äôt want it to drag on too long. Later, he told me they had spontaneously gone to the movies after grabbing something to eat, which again felt very ‚Äúdate-like‚Äù to me. He acknowledged this, apologized, and repeatedly assured me he wasn‚Äôt interested in her romantically.

I trust my boyfriend and don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs cheating or hiding anything from me. However, I don‚Äôt understand why he can‚Äôt take a break from seeing her for a couple of weeks‚Äîespecially during a difficult time in our relationship. I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm overreacting by wanting that. He has other female coworkers he texts regularly, but he never meets them in his free time or while he‚Äôs on vacation.

Stare intently at your computer screen while occasionally sighing or frowning. Bonus points if you nod slightly, as if you‚Äôve just discovered a groundbreaking solution to a problem you don‚Äôt have.


2. Master the Alt-Tab Switch
Keep important-looking documents open in one tab while watching cat videos in another. If anyone walks by, switch tabs like your job depends on it.


3. Hold a Pen at All Times
If you‚Äôre holding a pen, you look like you‚Äôre either writing, thinking about writing, or about to write something very important. It‚Äôs the ultimate low-effort accessory.


4. The Power Walk
Walk briskly through the office while looking slightly stressed. People will assume you‚Äôre handling something urgent, even if you‚Äôre just headed to the snack cupboard.


5. Schedule Fake Meetings
Block out your calendar with mysterious ‚Äústrategy sessions‚Äù and ‚Äúproject reviews.‚Äù Spend the time drinking coffee in the break room.


6. Send Emails at Odd Hours
Draft emails during the day but schedule them to send late at night. It‚Äôll look like you‚Äôre working overtime while you‚Äôre actually binge-watching TV.


7. The Double-Monitor Illusion
Set up two screens: one for actual work, the other for open spreadsheets or graphs that mean absolutely nothing. Whenever someone looks, you‚Äôre ‚Äúanalyzing data.‚Äù


8. Ask Vague, Important-Sounding Questions
Casually ask coworkers, ‚ÄúHave we streamlined the workflow for that deliverable yet?‚Äù They‚Äôll nod and say ‚Äúgood point‚Äù because no one knows what you‚Äôre talking about.


9. Master the ‚ÄúJust About to Do It‚Äù Line
If a boss asks about a task, say, ‚ÄúI was just about to start that!‚Äù You weren‚Äôt, but now it looks like you‚Äôre proactive.


10. Attend All Meetings (Even the Useless Ones)
Show up to meetings, take notes (doodle), and occasionally say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great point.‚Äù Presence is 90% of appearing productive.


11. The Sticky Note Strategy
Cover your desk with colorful sticky notes filled with vague reminders like ‚ÄúFollow up‚Äù or ‚ÄúQ4 alignment.‚Äù It makes you look overwhelmed and organized at the same time.


12. Carry a Stack of Papers
Wander the office with a stack of documents and an intense expression. No one will stop you because you clearly have ‚Äúplaces to be.‚Äù


13. Make a Spreadsheet About Nothing
Create a spreadsheet with columns of meaningless data and random charts. Open it frequently so people think you‚Äôre analyzing something critical.


14. Be Seen Typing Aggressively
Type loudly and quickly while occasionally muttering things like ‚Äúunbelievable‚Äù or ‚Äúthis timeline is insane.‚Äù People will assume you‚Äôre under pressure.


15. Look Exhausted but Determined
Rub your eyes, drink copious amounts of coffee, and mention how ‚Äúit‚Äôs been a day.‚Äù Everyone will assume you‚Äôve been working hard, even if you haven‚Äôt done a thing.


If you do these things right, not only will you look busy, but you might actually trick yourself into being productive‚Äîby accident.

I just got back from an incredible Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas, and I had to share my experience. It was honestly one of the best day trips I've ever taken, and I think you guys might find this helpful if you're planning to visit.

I researched a ton of options before booking, but I ended up going with this tour (https://athometouch.com/SouthRim) mainly because of the value for money and the great reviews. For $80, it's pretty much a steal considering everything that's included.

The day started early - they picked me up from my hotel around 6 AM. Pro tip: grab a coffee and maybe pack some snacks for the road. The bus was super comfortable with AC and a bathroom, which was crucial for the long ride. Our driver/guide (shoutout to Mike!) was actually hilarious and kept us entertained with interesting facts about the area.

We made a quick stop in Kingman, Arizona, which was perfect for stretching our legs and grabbing some extra snacks. Once we got to the South Rim, everything was perfectly organized. We visited multiple viewpoints, including Mather Point and Bright Angel Point - honestly, pictures don't do justice to how massive and beautiful the canyon is in person.

The meal voucher came in handy, and the food was surprisingly decent. I opted for the IMAX movie upgrade ($15 extra), which was cool to watch during our break at the National Geographic Visitor Center. Some people in our group did the helicopter tour, and they couldn't stop raving about it.

What really made this tour worth it:
- Zero stress about driving or navigation
- All entrance fees included
- Multiple viewpoints in one day
- Professional guide who actually knows their stuff
- Comfortable transportation
- Hotel pickup/drop-off (huge plus after a long day)

Things to consider:
- It's a long day (14 hours total)
- You might want to bring extra snacks
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Bring a light jacket (it can get chilly at the rim)

I've seen some people trying to do this trip on their own, but honestly, for the price and convenience, this tour is the way to go. You can check out all the details and book here: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim

If you're on the fence about visiting the Grand Canyon while in Vegas, just do it. It's one of those bucket-list experiences that's totally worth it. Feel free to ask any questions - I'd be happy to share more details about my experience!",1,1734395125.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

1hfy15n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1hfy15n/why_bitcoin_is_useless_a_critical_look_at_its/,Why Bitcoin is Useless: A Critical Look at Its True Value,"

In recent years, Bitcoin has gained immense popularity, often hailed as the future of money or even as a ""store of value"" similar to gold. However, after examining its core features and considering its broader implications, I believe Bitcoin is ultimately useless. From its divisibility to its volatility, Bitcoin fails to meet the fundamental requirements of a currency and lacks the stability that would make it a practical means of exchange or an effective store of value. Let me explain why.

1. Divisibility Doesn't Equal Scarcity

One of the primary selling points of Bitcoin is its divisibility ‚Äî after all, you can break a Bitcoin down into 100 million smaller units, called satoshis. At first glance, this might seem like an advantage, but it doesn‚Äôt make Bitcoin any scarcer.

Consider the example of pizza. If you divide a pizza into more slices, the pizza doesn't become any rarer or more valuable. In fact, it‚Äôs easier for more people to have a share. Bitcoin works in the same way: while it can be divided into many smaller pieces, the fact that we can divide it doesn't change the fact that anyone with enough Bitcoin can sell it for cash. This ability to break it into fractions might seem to enhance its value, but it only creates more accessibility. Dividing a finite asset doesn‚Äôt make it more valuable; it just makes it easier to share.

2. Bitcoin‚Äôs Limited Supply Isn‚Äôt All That Special

While it‚Äôs often touted that Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply is capped at 21 million coins, this doesn't mean that Bitcoin is inherently scarce or valuable. The limited supply argument might have worked if Bitcoin were a tangible asset, like gold, with real-world uses. But Bitcoin, being digital, can be endlessly divided, and its value is ultimately driven by speculation, not its scarcity.

In the end, Bitcoin‚Äôs value hinges entirely on market sentiment. If people believe in its future potential, they‚Äôll drive up the price, but if that belief falters, the price crashes. Moreover, Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility undermines its use as a stable store of value ‚Äî which is a critical characteristic of any currency. A ""limited supply"" means nothing if Bitcoin's value can fluctuate wildly from day to day, as we've seen with significant price drops that reduce its purchasing power. Scarcity only drives value when there's actual demand for the asset, not when it‚Äôs treated as an investment vehicle for speculators.

3. It‚Äôs Not a Practical Medium of Exchange

In theory, Bitcoin could replace traditional currencies, but in practice, it simply isn‚Äôt useful. Bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive. Bitcoin‚Äôs network can only process a limited number of transactions per second, making it unsuitable for everyday use. For example, in high-demand periods, Bitcoin transaction fees can spike, and the confirmation time can be hours. You certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to use Bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee when the transaction could take several minutes or more, and you might end up paying high fees.

Furthermore, most people don't use Bitcoin to buy goods or services ‚Äî they hold onto it, hoping the price will go up. In other words, people are hoarding Bitcoin as a speculative asset rather than using it for transactions. This creates a self-fulfilling cycle where Bitcoin is only valuable because people believe it will continue to rise, but it doesn‚Äôt function as a stable and reliable medium of exchange.

4. Bitcoin is Not a Hedge Against Inflation

Many advocates of Bitcoin claim it is a hedge against inflation, arguing that, like gold, it preserves purchasing power in times of economic uncertainty. But Bitcoin has not been around long enough to prove its ability to withstand inflation. In fact, Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility makes it more susceptible to extreme fluctuations, not less.

For instance, imagine you buy 2 Bitcoin at $2 each, and then the price of goods doubles. You‚Äôd think you‚Äôve protected yourself, but in reality, your Bitcoin might have dropped in value by 50% in the same period. The inflation of prices doesn't always correlate to the devaluation of fiat currencies; sometimes it's simply an issue of market fluctuations, which Bitcoin is not immune to.

So, how has Bitcoin truly protected anyone from inflation? The reality is that the price of Bitcoin often follows speculative bubbles, and its price can drop rapidly, eroding purchasing power in the process. Bitcoin may seem like a good hedge in theory, but in practice, it‚Äôs far from being a reliable way to protect wealth during periods of economic instability.

5. Bitcoin Is Ultimately Backed by Nothing

When people claim that Bitcoin is ‚Äúbacked‚Äù by its blockchain or its limited supply, they are ignoring the fact that Bitcoin is backed by nothing tangible. The U.S. dollar, despite being fiat money, is backed by the trust in the U.S. government and its economy. Bitcoin, however, has no central authority. There‚Äôs no backing, no gold reserves, no government support ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply a digital asset with value driven by speculation.

The blockchain technology behind Bitcoin is certainly impressive, but it does not create intrinsic value. Bitcoin‚Äôs value is purely driven by market participants who buy into the system. Without continued demand and belief in its future, Bitcoin could easily lose its value, rendering it useless as a currency.

Conclusion

In the end, Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal lies in its novelty and speculative potential, but it doesn‚Äôt meet the basic criteria of a reliable currency or store of value. Its divisibility doesn‚Äôt make it scarce, its limited supply doesn‚Äôt create actual demand, and its volatility makes it unsuitable for daily transactions. Bitcoin is backed by nothing tangible and ultimately relies on speculation, making it a risky investment rather than a practical currency.

Until Bitcoin can evolve into something more stable and useful for everyday transactions, it remains nothing more than a digital asset subject to the whims of the market. The idea of Bitcoin as a universal currency or store of value is, in my view, a fantasy ‚Äî a speculative bubble waiting to burst ",0,1734395092.0,Bitcoin,16,0.18,False

","Hello everyone,

I looked around on Reddit, but I couldn't find any specific forum for planning revenge, so I'm making a post here to ask for your advice.

I'm a male in my 20s, currently working in aviation in Europe, and I just broke up with my ex (female, also in her 20s) due to a lot of disagreements, mainly about finances.

A bit of backstory (I'll keep it somewhat vague to protect my privacy, of course):  
We met over the internet last summer when she texted me through an app in 2023. We started chatting, got interested in each other right away, and after a few months of texting, I decided to fly to her country to meet her. I spent a week there, and while some moments were pleasant, we also had some serious discussions too, mainly about the future. Since I was serious about the relationship from the start and, I wanted to know how my partner viewed certain aspects of life.

Our disagreements were mostly about finances. In her country, men are expected to pay for everything, there's no concept of any kind of 50/50, even as friends. Men are also expected to have a house before proposing, get down on one knee, no sex before marriage, etc. You get the point.

Anyway, I shared my views as well. Being an immigrant myself and having the same shit on going back home but growing up in Europe since I was a child, I see things differently. I value equality¬†**A LOT**. Since she moved to Europe this September, I did a lot to help her. I gave her and her best friend my travel benefits through my airline so they wouldn't have to spend money on flights. I tried to ease some of her financial stress by anticipating admission fees for various universities across the country. I got half of it back, but she still owes me some money. It‚Äôs not a huge amount, but it‚Äôs symbolic.

I drove around the city where she eventually decided to study, looked for apartments for her and her best friend, and talked to the owners since people here don‚Äôt really speak English. Once she arrived, we lived in almost the same city, I'm closer to the airport for work, and she lives closer to the university.

During her time here, I showed her love and understanding. She wanted to visit certain places, we did. She wanted to try new foods, we did. She would send me Instagram reels of things she wanted to experience, and we tried those too, all at my expense of course. I even took her some famous spots in the county and in the mountains for her birthday and celebrated at a Michelin star restaurant because she loved the view from its window, surprised her with a cake that she knew nothing about while everyone was singing happy birthday.

Yet, despite all of this, she never even bought me a cup of coffee or even ask me. Every time she came to my place, I would pick her up, and she was always hungry so we‚Äôd always go out to get food (again, at my expense). She never cooked at my place except for pancakes once or twice. I mostly cooked and washed the dishes while we talked about shared responsibilities, something she agreed to but never followed through on.

(I realize now that I sound like one of those guys on the internet whose stories I always used to feel sorry for. Funny how life works‚ÄîI‚Äôve become them.)

Anyway, I made sure she had everything she needed to feel comfortable at my place towels, slippers, pajamas, menstrual pads, a teddy bear, fresh sheets, a clean house, and heated house since she‚Äôs always cold. I listened to her vent about her day, her gossip, and her disappointments, and I always gave her feedback.

When it came to intimacy, we could only masturbated each other since she wanted no sex before marriage which I respected because I valued her choices. I always made sure she was pleasured, she was relaxed first. I did all of this only to get broken up with over a¬†**text message**, where she called me ‚Äúungrateful‚Äù for what she‚Äôs done for me.

I never asked for big surprises, gifts, or expensive dinners. I always appreciated small gestures. I just wanted to feel that my partner cared for me too. For example, I didn‚Äôt expect her to take me to a fancy restaurant‚Äîjust buying me a ‚Ç¨1.50 burger from McDonald's or randomly asking if I wanted a coffee would have been enough. I never made her pay for anything, nor did I ask but is it really¬†**too much**¬†to expect some consideration from your partner? She knew about this as i expressed that i want to be treated too sometimes.

She got mad when I pointed out the hypocrisy of her paying for things when she‚Äôs with her girlfriends but refusing to do the same for me. I mean, it‚Äôs okay to treat your friends, but not your partner? Hmm‚Ä¶

After the breakup text, she messaged me to arrange an exchange of belongings. I agreed and asked her for the money she owed me, money she had promised to pay back when she first arrived in Europe (a deadline¬†**she**¬†set for herself). Instead of responding, she blocked me on every social media platform.

There‚Äôs a lot more, but I don‚Äôt want to get too deep into it. If anyone has questions, I‚Äôm happy to answer.

**Now for the main part:**

She recently booked a 3‚Äì4 day vacation with her girlfriends to a beautiful place in Europe. The tickets for their flights are, of course, my travel benefits. My question is:

Should I cancel their flights¬†**before**¬†they depart?  
Or should I cancel¬†**only the return flight**¬†once they‚Äôre already there?

This would be¬†**Phase One**.

**Phase Two**¬†would involve contacting her landlord to explain how, in my view, she used me to settle down here and then decided to cut me off entirely.

The¬†**nuclear phase**¬†would be filing an official complaint with the police, presenting all the proof I have, admission fees I paid, receipts, messages, etc.

Actually, I think I only started actually grieving the end of the marriage this year, and that's thanks in no small part to a bunch of therapy.

4 years ago my now-ex-wife wife developed something like borderline personality disorder and fell in love with someone else. I tried moving on and asked for a divorce, but she felt abandoned and put me through the ringer with emotional abuse. In the past year she has gotten some significant professional help and medication, which is helping. I think knowing she's not so volatile has given me emotional space to start properly feeling the sadness that I mostly ignored for years.

That said, we try and keep things semi-normal for our kids and celebrate birthdays and holidays together. However, I am really fearing Christmas. Anytime we do something similar to what we used to do as an unbroken family I feel down for days afterwards, and now that I'm allowing myself to properly feel my emotions around this, it's even more difficult. 

After Thanksgiving I felt almost catatonic for several days, and that was celebrated at my home, which somewhat helped moderate the nostalgic feelings. Christmas morning is going to be at her house, which is the house we bought together 15 years ago and raised our kids in. I have strong feelings around the loss of my home. And to make it worse, her sister and her sister's family are going to be in town and at Christmas morning. Their being there is just going to intensify my feelings of sadness over the family I lost.

I would really just rather spend Christmas morning by myself drinking coffee and watching YouTube. Maybe I would have the kids come over in the afternoon to open presents with me. I know they'll be really disappointed if I'm not there in the morning, though. And I know my not being there will also create an uneasy atmosphere between my ex-wife and her sister, who also felt a lot of the sting from my ex-wife's mental illness these past few years.

I'm just really tired of doing things that require me to shut off emotionally just so things are OK. ",1,1734395049.0,self,1,0.67,False
1hfy04e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hfy04e/ive_worked_as_a_crime_scene_investigator_for_25/,I've worked as a crime scene investigator for 25 years. This is my weirdest case.,"On the 25th of November 2018, the victim pulled into a budget motel in the early hours of the morning. He booked room 12 for a three day stay, and on the fourth day the owner of the establishment sent his son to check on the victim. What he found was something that someone his age should never have witnessed. Or anyone for that matter. 

By the time I arrived at the scene, it had already been cordoned off. Members of the county police department had swarmed the area and in the absence of the sun, it was the blue and red flashing lights that cast their glow over the building. I made my way past the tenants who were half-asleep, doing their best at giving witness testimonial.I stepped by a particularly shaken forensic pathologist who was trying to call his mother and entered room 12. 

Now, I've been working as a crime scene investigator for more than twenty years. I have dealt with some truly confounding scenes before. In 2006, a body of a missing hiker was found in the woods just on the county line. It had been burnt to a crisp, but only the upper half. Below the waist was completely untouched, as was the surrounding area. 

More recently, a farmer reported a break in just after New year's eve. Presumably, someone had broken into his warehouse which housed an industrial animal carcass shredder. It had been used in the night and a pile of jellied flesh was found clumped at its mouth. Horrifically, it was eventually proven to be human, although couldn't be identified beyond that. Only one other thing was found at the scene. Within the remains was a small steel plaque, about the size of a business card, with the number 0002916 engraved in it.

I say all this for simple context. I am no stranger to the unexplainable, but what I saw in Room 12‚Ä¶ it still keeps me up at night. The following are excerpts from the crime scene report I filed that day. 


Incident Number: 24-0711
Date of Incident: November 29, 2018
Time of Arrival: 11:54 PM
Location: Room 12, Sir Sleep-a-Lot Motel, Yellow Smoke County
Reporting Officer: Detective Arthur Graham, Yellow Smoke County Police Department

Victim name: John Doe (Name yet to be confirmed through fingerprint or DNA)
Gender: male
Age: estimated to be mid-40s
Occupation: unknown 

Suspects: none at present 

The victim checked into the ‚ÄòSir Sleep-a-Lot‚Äô Motel on the morning of November 25th, 2018. He informed the motel owner, Mr. John Kelly, that he would be staying for three days. No known associates or visitors during the stay.

Victim was found laying on bed in supine position. Victim had skin removed crudely. Patches of flesh hang loosely, revealing bone in some areas. Teeth indents on right part of pelvic bone will be examined. The victim's head is absent from the scene. Notably, the body had been dressed in what appeared to be women‚Äôs undergarments, specifically a pair of lace stockings and a torn satin slip. Neither items of clothing belonged to the victim.  The body was likely dressed post-mortem. 

Addendum: Marks on right part of pelvic bone were positively identified as being from a human juvenile, estimated as between the ages of three and six. No dental record have been traced. 

Blood covers every inch of the room's four walls and carpet. The blood spray appears to be inconsistent with splatter from traumatic injury, possible use of pressurised device. The amount of blood was determined to be approximately two gallons, or 135% of the victim's total volume. 

Teeth were found on the room's desk, thirty-three in total arranged into a circular pattern ten inches in diameter. The careful arrangement appears to be ritualistic. The teeth are currently assumed to have been belonging to the victim. The location of the victim's head has not been identified.

Addendum: The findings of the forensic odontologist have determined that thirty-two of the thirty-three teeth belonged to a person matching the victim's description; a caucasian male in his forties. One of the teeth matches a younger caucasian female. It was eventually connected through dental records to be from twenty-four year old Alyssa Hadland, reported missing in 1997. The Hadland case was archived in 1999 due to absence of evidence. 

The victim‚Äôs tongue was discovered in the bathroom sink, exhibiting a complete severance at the base. The incision appeared clean and precise, suggesting the use of a surgical-grade or extremely sharp cutting instrument. Notably, the tongue was found in isolation within the sink, devoid of any other biological material, indicating that it may have been intentionally relocated post-excision. 

First responders noted signs of tampering on the coin-operated television in the room, which intermittently activated to static approximately once an hour. The television will be deconstructed for forensic examination to recover latent fingerprints and other trace evidence related to its manipulation.

Addendum: Both of the victim's eyes were recovered from the interior of the room's coin-operated television. The television screen had been removed and the eyes were placed within the cavity where the cathode ray tube was situated. This positioning suggests deliberate placement, indicating a possible symbolic motive.

The only item of clothing found at the scene belonging to the victim was one pair of denim jeans, which witness John Kelly recalls being worn by the victim the morning he checked in. The jeans were contaminated with the victim's blood. In the pockets were found a one-way bus ticket from the towns of Cosgrave to Mayor's Income, one packet of apple flavoured gum and a button. No other possessions of the victim were found. A pair of small, leather lace-up shoes were found at the foot of the bed. From the lack of blood stains, we can assume the shoes were placed there after the homicide. 

Addendum A: A shirt likely belonging to the victim was found three weeks later partially buried in a field in San Tommaso, a small town 240 miles south of Yellow smoke. The shirt matched the description given by John Kelly of the victim. Blood samples taken from the shirt were a strong match to those taken from the crime scene, although without the identity of the victim a definitive link is challenging to corroborate.

Addendum B: The small shoes found at the crime scene were dated to 1909 and determined to have some value among antique dealers. Due to their small size they can be assumed to be children's shoes. 

The room showed no obvious signs of damage. The furniture appeared to have been undisturbed although a Bible was missing from the bedside cabinet. Neither John Kelly nor his son David, lead witnesses of the case, recall seeing the victim with any luggage. For this reason, it is unclear if his possessions were taken or if he simply had none to begin with. The motive of this homicide remains unclear. 


I'll save you the rest of the procedural formalities. I've lost track of how many nights I've spent awake, staring at my computer screen reading and rereading this report. It's stayed with me for the past six years, constantly at the back of mind. At my personal behest, the case remained open despite insufficient evidence and a complete lack of any leads. When it was finally shelved at the beginning of this year, they were no closer to solving it than we were the day we found him. 

Earlier this week, I learnt that it had been reopened by the FBI. I assumed that there must be someone else in this department who felt the same way about the case as I did, strong enough to reach out and request assistance from the feds. I was tasked with compiling any and all digital evidence we had on the case onto a USB flash. 

I felt weird combing through all the reports, files and forensics. It felt like I was visiting an old friend. I added the documents I wrote up on the day, the dozens of crime scene photos and witness statements. I've studied them all meticulously myself. I doubted some Yale boy with a corner office could do any better. 

I kept trailing through the earmarked files, checking and double checking if there was anything I'd missed. It was dark now. I spent the day working from home, hunched over my computer in my sorry excuse for a library. That's what my job mostly consists of now. I couldn't wait for retirement. Maybe then I would have the time to read some of these books I have lying around.

I decided I was finished for the night. I'd squeezed every piece of relevant information I could find onto that hard drive. It was up to the FBI now. I only hoped that if our victim left any family behind, they could one day get some closure from this. I was about to shut my computer down when something caught my eye.

Witness_1.mp3 

It was an audio file. Somehow I hadn't noticed it before. Hell, I don't think I had even listened to it before. To my knowledge, all the Witness statements taken that night were written. I clicked on it, figuring it must've been taken from David Kelly, the kid who'd found the body. 

I took a sip of my last dregs of coffee and sat back in my chair, jacking up the volume. The audio wasn't the best quality. It was shrouded in the static of an analogue recording and to my shock, the supposed ‚Äò1st witness‚Äô had a woman's voice. The following is a transcript of what was on that file.

First responder: ""What were you doing in the area before you discovered the body?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúI'm staying in Room 14, the room next door to where it happened. Been there for the past two weeks, thereabouts. I've come on hard times recently, you know how it is. I was living out of a van until this, but it wasn't exactly reliable.‚Äù

First responder: Apologies ma'am, I meant what were you doing immediately before discovering the body.

Witness 1: Right‚Ä¶ Well, I came back from work around nine. I clean at the elementary school in town. I came back and spent the rest of the day in my room. I had dinner and I was just catching up with the news before I went to sleep.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúCan you describe how and when you found the body?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúGee, it must've been around ten. I was turning in for the night when I heard a banging noise from next door. I guessed he must've brought a lady friend over so I tried my best to ignore it, but it kept getting louder. It didn't sound like a headboard neither, more like someone chopping wood. It was too much for me to ignore so I got up to go complain. I found the door unlocked and it opened wide up when I knocked. That's when I saw him that poor, poor man.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúCould you please describe the scene you came across as detailed as you can?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúIt was terrible, just terrible. I saw my neighbour kneeling in the corner of his room. His head had been cut off! Can you imagine that? There was blood covering everything around him. I almost vomited there and then. Then I saw the man in the bathroom.‚Äù

 *there's a pause*

First responder: ‚ÄúCould you please go on? You said there was someone else at the scene?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ a real weirdo. I didn't notice him at first. He was just peeking out from behind the bathroom door, watching me. When I did finally notice him, we just stared at each other for a moment or two. Then he just strolled out from his little hiding place."" 

*another pause*

First responder: ‚ÄúPlease continue, I assure you everything you have to say will be of some importance to our investigation. Start by describing this man you saw.‚Äù

Witness 1: OK then. He was a freak, I'll say it. When I got a good look at him I saw that he had this great bulbous head. He was bald as a newborn and the entire back part of his head was all deformed and sagging down. I think he had this disease. Oh what's it called? A boy I went to school with had it‚Ä¶‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúAre you thinking of hydrocephalus?‚Äù

Witness 1: Yes! Yeah, that's it. Hydrocephalus. But it was much worse than that kid I knew. Sorry if i'm coming across as rude but It looked like some horrible octopus. And the front part of his head was far too thin. He has this pointy chin and cheekbones. His eyes were as bulging as his skull. All yellow and white, I think he had cataracts. Oh, and he must've been around seven feet tall, at least. He was hunching over where he met the ceiling.

First responder: ‚ÄúCan you describe what he was wearing?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúSure‚Ä¶ he had this battered old duster coat on. It was black, but he was covered in these stitched rags of red and green. The coat hung down to the floor, but I could make out the tips of brown leather boots poking out from the hem.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúCan you-‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúOh! Pardon my interrupting, but the man, he was holding this‚Ä¶ Well I don't know what it was. It looked like a lobster pot with a handle and must be two dozen blades sticking out of it. Knives mostly, and razor blades, axe heads, chains, that sort of stuff. Anyway, go on.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúRight. What did you do when he came closer to you?‚Äù 

Witness 1: ‚ÄúWell I ran. I just ran. Out of the motel and down the road until I realised everything I owned was in my room. I didn't fancy having to start over from nothing for a third time so I came back, and that's when you bumped into me.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúAlright, and how long was it from discovering the body until you called 911?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúOh I didn't call 911, honey.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ didn't?‚Äù

Witness 1: ‚ÄúOh no, by the time I came back from my little jog the place was already crawling with police. I still haven't been allowed back in my room.‚Äù

First responder: ‚ÄúAre you aware that-‚Äù

*End*

His speech became muffled after that until the recording was nothing but static hum that'd been in the background since the beginning. After hearing this for the first time I didn't know what to think. I just sat in my old oak chair until my wife came in to tell me that she was going to bed. I kissed her goodnight and went back to aimlessly staring at the computer screen. Eventually, I closed it and stood up. I took the usb stick and left it on my desk. I left the room and locked the door behind me. I changed, washed and climbed into bed with my wife. I kissed her on the back of her neck and tried to fall asleep. That‚Ä¶ thing that did this was still out there. But that wasn't my problem anymore.

I wanted to get advise about something that happened at work. For context I'm a 22 female working at my first job (a coffee chain) and I accidently offended my coworker who is a woman in her 30s, not sure of exact age but probably around 35 who has worked there for some years. We are in a drive through only building so no customers can see or hear us. I'm pretty quite but try to help when I can. I've only been here for 3 months and work with her about half of the time? I think. My coworker doesn't really talk to me and tends to leave me out of conversations and is well liked by my other coworkers. They did warn me though that she gets offended easily.

She was taking an order and wrung it up as the wrong drink. I here this through the headset we all wear where the baristas making the drink are talking about it. I saw that my coworker was wearing her headset but was talking to another coworker and not fixing the order (the reason this is so important is due to the different prices of the drinks.) I tried to get her attention not using my headset due to being right next to her.

""hey coworker's name!"" No response, ""Hey coworker's name!""...""Hey coworker's name!"" Now I know that I was speaking really loud when I was calling out for her but didn't realise I was so loud in the moment. She asked ""what"" angrily so I explained the issue and she cut me off saying that my shift manager was fixing the issue and that I was being really rude. I didn't know that shift manager was fixing it. I told her ""I'm so sorry."" and she told that it was very rude and that I shouldn't talk to her like a child. I told her that I was sorry and didn't know I was doing that. She just said that was rude and went away from me.

Later I wanted to give a better apology and told her ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you"". She said I as being rude and that she thinks I was watching her to catch her doing something wrong. I just said ""I'm sorry, please tell me if I ever make you uncomfortible or upset you"" and she just said that she wouldn't because that would cause drama. So I left her alone. I eventually talked to my shift lead and assistant manager sho told me that I did nothing wrong and that sometimes coworker just gets that way. I asked her not to speak on coworker on my behalf was this started with my mistake.

What should I do? I apologized and I know that doing it too much isn't good. I try to be friendly with her before this and generally never interfere with her work, so I don't think it's that? I had a feeling she never really liked me but this was just a shock because her tone wasn't that she was simply telling me this, she was practically yelling at me. How do I right this? I feel really bad knowing I did something wrong in the moment but not knowing what I did to make her dislike me overall? What do I do? I'm thinking about bringing in a gift for everyone working when I next come in, would that be good?

1hfxuq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hfxuq4/tarvolons_2024_recommended_reading_list_holiday/,Tarvolon's 2024 Recommended Reading List (Holiday Edition),"It‚Äôs time for my favorite post of the year, where I share all the best sci-fi and fantasy I read from 2024. I write two versions of this post each year. The second comes out in late February, once I‚Äôve had a chance to read works from everyone else‚Äôs Best of the Year lists. And the first comes out now, so that others can have a chance to read from mine. So let‚Äôs take a look at the holiday edition of Tarvolon‚Äôs 2024 Recommended Reading List.¬†

The only big change this year is that I‚Äôve split each category into Top-Tier Favorites and Honorable Mentions. Both categories are still favorites, both are still highly recommended, but I‚Äôm just reading and recommending too many stories right now and need to make this list a little less overwhelming. So the Honorable Mentions are split off and get a little bit less word count on the mini-review. But they‚Äôre still great stories that are well worth reading.¬†

As always, I can only recommend things I‚Äôve read, which is a lot, but which is not everything. I try to cast a wide net, especially in the shorter fiction categories, but there is so much out there that keeping up would be a full-time job. Right now, I‚Äôve read 24 novels, 15 novellas, 61 novelettes, and 192 short stories that were published in 2024. My tastes are idiosyncratic, so just because I loved something does not mean you‚Äôll like it, and just because I didn‚Äôt love something doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt. But I do my best in limited space to explain what stood out about each work to give other readers a sense of whether it may be for them.¬†

Each category is organized alphabetically by author last name. There is [another version on my blog](https://www.tarvolon.com/2024/12/16/tar-vols-2024-recommended-reading-list-holiday-edition/), with links to full reviews or free copies, where applicable.¬†

# Novels

# Top-Tier Favorites

* **The Warm Hands of Ghosts by Katherine Arden** (Del Rey). This story of family, trauma, and grief set during WWI largely eschews combat scenes in favor of dealing with the fallout. A speculative element heavy on memory and questionable bargains dovetails wonderfully with the weight of war to make for a tremendous whole.¬†
* **The Other Valley by Scott Alexander Howard** (Atria). My favorite novel of the year, a literary time travel tale with a tight focus on an ordinary character dealing with foreknowledge of tragedy. Expertly portrays the mundane moments in a life, but with a time scale that allows it to explore long-term consequences of small decisions.¬†

# Honorable Mentions

* **Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi** (Knopf). Low-magic, Italian-inspired historical fantasy series-starter, with a coming-of-age and plenty of backstabbing.¬†
* **The Tainted Cup by Robert Jackson Bennett** (Del Rey). A fantasy mystery in a fascinating world that does justice to both the ‚Äúfantasy‚Äù and the ‚Äúmystery.‚Äù¬†

# Novellas

# Top-Tier Favorites

* **It Lasts Forever and Then It‚Äôs Over by Anne de Marcken** (New Directions). This disorienting, plotless meditation on meaning and loss from the perspective of a sentient zombie is often confusing but always compelling, with some of the best individual scenes I read all year.¬†

* **The Indomitable Captain Holli by Rich Larson** (Clarkesworld). The child-perspective narrative voice absolutely steals the show in a thrilling and high-stakes post-apocalyptic adventure that keeps the tension high with secondary POVs from multiple sides of the conflict.¬†

* **The Butcher of the Forest by Premee Mohamed** (Tordotcom). This quest into an uncanny forest from which no one returns is exceptional purely for the atmosphere, with the lead‚Äôs past tragedy and present internal turmoil only adding to its depth.¬†
* **Death Benefits by Kristine Kathryn Rusch** (Asimov‚Äôs). Takes the best parts of a mosaic story and an investigation tale, with a multitude of short segments from the perspective of those who lost loved ones in war, given structure and forward momentum by an investigation into one particular case where the soldier may not actually be dead. The plot is compelling, but the little character vignettes make this my top novella of the year.¬†

# Honorable Mentions

* **Spill by Cory Doctorow** (Reactor). A story of a hacker and an activist fighting back against the villains behind an oil pipeline‚Äîit‚Äôs the character voices that make this.¬†

* **The Tusks of Extinction by Ray Nayler** (Tordotcom). An angry but meditative anti-poaching novella with a variety of perspectives, including a scientist whose consciousness is implanted in a mammoth.¬†

* **Proof of Concept by Kristine Kathryn Rusch** (Asimov‚Äôs). A murder mystery on a spaceship, with loads of pathos and excellent pacing.¬†

# Novelettes

# Top-Tier Favorites

* **The Aquarium for Lost Souls by Natasha King** (Strange Horizons). A wildly disorienting sci-fi slipstream tale about a woman repeatedly navigating unspace with a mortal wound and the embodiment of the Pacific Ocean as sometimes-ally, sometimes-enemy, all to tell a very personal, human story about coming to grips with relationships that aren‚Äôt quite what she thought they were. Ambitious and enthralling.¬†
* **The Brotherhood of Montague St. Video by Thomas Ha** (Clarkesworld). A quiet and compelling meditation on experience, memory, and preservation of imperfect moments. There‚Äôs a bit of a technothriller to give it some plot structure, but this is a favorite for the atmosphere and themes.¬†
* **The Four Sisters Overlooking the Sea by Naomi Kritzer** (Asimov‚Äôs). A beautiful blend of science and fairy tale in a slow-building story of a summer research project in which the speculative and mundane elements dovetail wonderfully into a satisfying and pitch perfect finish.¬†
* **The Robot by Lavie Tidhar** (Uncanny). A series of slices-of-life in the centuries of caregiving, war-making, isolation, and friendship in the life of the titular robot. A lovely and touching story that effectively stands alone in the *Central Station* universe.
* **Loneliness Universe by Eugenia Triantafyllou** (Uncanny). A story that feels all too real despite the wild premise, in which friends and family suddenly lose the ability to perceive each other in real life and can only connect on social media. Featuring a lead who asks the questions you‚Äôd want her to ask when dropped into a bizarre speculative scenario, this one is exceptional more for the way it handles the emotions, examining interpersonal connections through the lens of their loss.¬†

# Honorable Mentions

* **Something Crossing Over, Something Coming Back** **by Timothy Mudie** (Clarkesworld). A mind-hopping spy returns to meet the man he once impersonated, with a deep dive into his psychology and a deliberately open ending.¬†
* **Binomial Nomenclature and the Mother of Happiness** **by Alexandra Munck** (Clarkesworld). A scientist becomes obsessed with research into visual perception of emotions, while frequently failing to perceive those around her.¬†
* **Shadow Films by Ben Peek** (Lightspeed). A fascinating tale of secret messages hidden in films, with forays into conspiracies, aliens, and internment camps.¬†
* **Signs of Life by Sarah Pinsker** (Uncanny). Reconciliation of estranged sisters, with Pinsker‚Äôs trademark unsettling atmosphere and a slow-building speculative element.¬†
* **Dead Reckoning in 6/8 time by Sabrina Vourvoulias** (GigaNotoSaurus). A thrilling competition with the devil‚Äîthink The Devil Went Down to Georgia, but with folk dance from Veracruz‚Äîthat‚Äôs long on the power of community and solidarity.¬†
* **Ol‚Äô Big Head by Melissa A. Watkins** (Lightspeed). A slow-building ghost story with an immersive vernacular narration that provides a quick and compelling hook.
* **The Peregrine Falcon Flies West by Yang Wanqing, translated by Jay Zhang** (Clarkesworld, originally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World). A strange but compelling mashup of a yearning for adventure, a love of birds passed from mother to daughter, and first contact.¬†

# Short Stories

# Top-Tier Favorites

* **A Theory of Missing Affections by Renan Bernardo** (Clarkesworld). Simultaneously a story of sisters trying to maintain a relationship despite vast physical and philosophical distance, plus research into a godlike departed race with a penchant for psychological torture devices. Unified by the exploration of different perspectives, this provides a compelling family drama and an utterly fascinating historical research storyline.¬†
* **A Lullaby of Anguish by Marie Croke** (Apex). An angry tale of disaster voyeurism, featuring a lead who only wants to move on from the sins of her childhood but a society who won‚Äôt let her, this delivers a cathartic clash with a sister‚Äôs toxic beau and some fascinatingly complicated family undercurrents.¬†
* **Afflictions of the New Age by Katherine Ewell** (Uncanny). A story of aging and memory in a world that can halt physical aging but can do little for the mind, told in disorienting snippets from various times that the lead is incapable of distinguishing. The plot is confusing in a way that serves the theme wonderfully‚Äîbeautiful, unsettling, and deeply compelling.¬†
* **Grottmata by Thomas Ha** (Nightmare). A sci-fi/horror story of occupation and resistance, with compelling characters and layers upon layers of depth. Ha is an expert at building tension, and that‚Äôs on full display here in a piece that fully won me over despite my usual aversion to horror.¬†
* **The Sort by Thomas Ha** (Clarkesworld). Again, the building tension of the uncanny stands out in this tale of a neurodivergent father and son visiting a small desert town as a road trip stopover. This feels like a piece of a larger story, but it so effectively explores the feeling of parenting someone who is just a little bit different (or *being* someone who is a little bit different) in a setting that perfectly walks the line between eerie and mundane.¬†
* **Our Father by K.J. Khan** (Clarkesworld). A story of family and sacrifice in long-haul space travel, told in second-person by a narrator who has only years after the fact begun to grasp the challenges faced on the journey. Extremely effectively builds connection to the characters in a very short space‚ÄîI‚Äôm rarely enamored by stories under 2,000 words, and this may be my favorite ever at this length.¬†
* **Why Don't We Just Kill the Kid in the Omelas Hole by Isabel J. Kim** (Clarkesworld). I love Isabel J. Kim‚Äôs entire oeuvre, but this one is particularly excellent. It‚Äôs a return to Ursula K. Le Guin‚Äôs famed ‚ÄúThe Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas,‚Äù using the premise to explore social media responses to injustice in a way that‚Äôs often laugh-out-loud funny and mirrors Le Guin‚Äôs original in the way it explores questions without trying to lead the reader to pat answers.¬†
* **A Move to a New Country by Dan Musgrave** (Reckoning). A deeply personal story about allocating space on a generation ship, focusing in particular on an ecologist who can‚Äôt bear to leave his grandmother behind, regardless of her own wishes. Draws some compelling parallels to other forced relocation in Osage history, but it‚Äôs the family story amidst the backdrop of sweeping societal change that makes this so excellent.¬†
* **Another Old Country** **by Nadia Radovich** (Apparition). A mashup of a couple different folktales from different cultures, coming together in the life of a contemporary teen as magical figures begin intruding on her life. I‚Äôm not a big retelling guy, but this one grabbed me from the beginning and never let go, with its compelling narration and focus on translation and culture clash. And it gets even better on reread.¬†
* **Driver by Sameem Siddiqui** (Clarkesworld). A disorienting tale of an aging driver lamenting the way he‚Äôs commonly treated and intermittently reminiscing on various key figures in his life‚Äîoften told in second-person to absent interlocutors. The narrative voice makes this well worth the read, but the mysterious actions of a strange repeat customer give this one a satisfying plot to go along with that narration.¬†
* **An Intergalactic Smuggler's Guide to Homecoming by Tia Tashiro** (Clarkesworld). Pretty much what it says on the tin: an intergalactic smuggler returns to her home planet with highly restricted cargo and questions about whether to attempt reconciliation with the sister she‚Äôd left years prior. Perhaps not as formally daring as some of my other favorites (or as [Tashiro‚Äôs appearance](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/tashiro_11_23/) on my [2023 Recommended Reading List](https://www.tarvolon.com/2023/12/21/tar-vols-2023-recommended-reading-list-holiday-edition/)), but it‚Äôs so much fun that it doesn‚Äôt matter.¬†
* **The Patron Saint of Flatliners by K.A. Wiggins** (Mysterion). Another story with a great narrative voice, this one is told by a woman who died of overdose and has since found herself pulled to others on the brink of death. We see one particular attempt to claw a man back from the grave, interspersed with heartbreaking reflections on emotional isolation. A gripping read that never takes the easy way out.¬†

# Honorable Mentions

# Observations

* Holy wow, what a year for novellas! My Recommended Reading List has never had more than three novellas on it. This year, it has seven! More than 45% of the 2024-published novellas that I read ended up on my favorites list. That number was so staggering that I removed the publication date filter on my spreadsheet to see whether I was just especially soft on novella scoring this year. I wasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just that seven of my top eight novellas¬†*read*¬†in 2024 were also *published* in 2024. It was an amazing novella year, and I‚Äôm going to be annoyed if a few of these don‚Äôt find their way onto award shortlists.¬†
* Every year, I look out for authors who appear more than once on my favorites list‚Äîthey‚Äôre people to pay special attention to in the future. This year, that list is led by Thomas Ha (four appearances), who also appeared multiple times on last year‚Äôs list. Ray Nayler appears more than once for a third straight year, and Isabel J. Kim surely would have if she hadn‚Äôt been so wrapped up in novel-writing that she only published one story. New to this year‚Äôs multiple-favorite list are A.T. Greenblatt, Kristine Kathryn Rusch, and Carlie St. George. And it does not escape my notice that two writers from last year‚Äôs multiple-favorites list, Naomi Kritzer and Renan Bernardo, ended up writing some of my top-tier favorites this year.¬†
* As usual, *Clarkesworld* is here a lot. That‚Äôs partially because they publish twice as many stories as most of the other popular genre magazines (at least if you exclude flash, which I do). It‚Äôs also partially because they‚Äôre just very good at what they do. And finally, it‚Äôs partially because I give them the most chances to pleasantly surprise me, regularly reading even the stories that don‚Äôt hook me in the opening paragraphs.¬†
* More than 20 different publications are represented on this list, but only two appear more than five times: *Clarkesworld* and *Asimov‚Äôs*. I read a lot more of *Asimov‚Äôs* this year than I had in the past, but with six appearances on the list and three in the top tier, it was a revelation.¬†¬†
* Another pleasant surprise this year was *Uncanny*, a magazine I‚Äôve read a lot in the past but appeared more times on my favorites list this year (four, with all but one in the top tier) than in any previous year. Not sure if they just had a good year, or whether being more intentional about searching for stories on my own instead of following social media buzz made a huge difference in my enjoyment. Perhaps both.
* As far as I can tell, 14 authors on this list are in their first two years of sci-fi/fantasy publishing and are eligible for the Astounding Award for Best New Writer: Leah Andelsmith, Anne de Marcken, Katherine Ewell, Scott Alexander Howard, Claire Jia-Wen, Natasha King, Charlie B. Lorch, Angela Liu, Ellis Nye, H.H. Pak, Nadia Radovich, Brandi Sperry, Tia Tashiro, and Melissa A. Watkins. Honestly that is a very impressive number.

1hfxu3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1hfxu3w/cant_get_along_with_mum/,Can‚Äôt get along with mum.,"Hi everyone kind of struggling a lot more than normal lately with constant bickering, yelling with mum. 

My mum has a complete inability to communicate and I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. 

Some examples.
I run a small business and do maybe three markets a year, mum takes me and stays with me throughout the day which I‚Äôm grateful for. I plan them months in advance, remind her weekly put it in her calendar etc. she enjoys the markets. 

Last weekend I had a market, we needed to be there at 9am. The night before she spent the night at my house but decided she needed to do something in the morning so picked me up for the market at 9.30. We got there with 10 minutes to set up, I was near crying setting up by myself because she didn‚Äôt feel well. 

I let it go because I just wanted to have a good day. 

This morning I really blew up at her though. I asked her to drive me to the post office to send an order. I asked 2 days ago so she could plan around it. I tried to plan it but she brushed it off and said I‚Äôll take you whatever. I‚Äôm asking because if I need to I‚Äôll find another way to get there. It‚Äôs just easier to go with her. 

We were in the car this morning running errands for her business, that I work at unpaid. We had to go there today. I brought up the post office, she said ‚Äò I‚Äôll take you after, maybe during idk I have a lot to do today‚Äô I lost it, I just want a clear schedule, I want her to clearly say we can go at this time. It‚Äôs important to go today as I have to send something. 

She said that I always do this, I‚Äôm always mean to her, I‚Äôm hard to be around. Really hurtful but I admittedly said mean things too. I feel like she does so much it just piles up and I explode. 

She has told me since I was little that I‚Äôm difficult, acted like I was abusive to her from the time I was 4 years old. I have been to therapy my whole life to fix it my ‚Äòbehaviour‚Äô and I‚Äôve actually just realised that I can try forever to fix myself but she has never tried to fix the way she communicates to me. 

Im not abusive or mean. Im so so frustrated and reached a point where I am completely done with the way she treats me. 

She cuts me off when I‚Äôm talking a lot and finishes my sentence to be negative then when I try to explain that isn‚Äôt what I was saying she shushes me and doesn‚Äôt let me talk. 

She was talking the other day about her bf, I had just spilt coffee on myself and sighed. This sigh apparently meant that I don‚Äôt want her to be happy with her bf and that I don‚Äôt like him. No I was covered in coffee and annoyed. 

I asked her if she wanted  to come over when she had a day off last week just to hang out. This was at 12pm. She said yes so I asked her to bring cat food on the way. 
She came over at 9.30 pm dropped the cat food off and left. I said oh I thought we could hang out. She got mad at me said I was ungrateful for her going out of her way to bring me cat food. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve learnt a lot about communication and what I need. The more I can articulate what‚Äôs happening the more fights we have. ",1,1734394532.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

For me I beg to differ jud huehue. Of course not the best coffee shop around. But Personally think that their Cafe Con Leche stepped up their game. Always my pick pag mag punta ako gcoffee. 

Ive seen people say na kusog jud ang business sa Green Coffee cuz they attract specific niche, which are usually studnets who study or adults working. Pero bitaw, as a student myself, conducive jud ilang place for studying. Siguro im in that specific niche and thats why I frequently go there, but still personally love their coffee jud.

1hfxtlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hfxtlo/aita_for_pitting_my_extreme_emotions_on/,AITA for pitting my extreme emotions on loneliness on my friends,"I do suffer from mental health issues which are undiagnosed but I‚Äôve been searching for help with them. I namely suffer from depression and extreme mood changes which can happen within minutes or even seconds in some wild cases.

I had a doctor‚Äôs appointment over the phone to discuss my mental health and to see where I should go for some help, overall the appointment went well. But right after it finished, I instantly changed mood and I went back to the same hollow-like feeling I usually have. I felt empty inside, and that I made a mistake by reaching out for help.

I had to go back to work which put me in a worse mood. Eventually finishing at 5pm, I took a walk to my mum‚Äôs house where I stayed for a few hours to have a coffee,  still not feeling all great. 

I get home and I feel exhausted and that I just want to play a game with some friends. We‚Äôve been playing marvel rivals recently which is fun, but my issue is that in the 18.3 hours I‚Äôve played with them, we‚Äôve not been in a voice chat. We would usually call while playing games, but since playing this, I‚Äôve played with JUST music in the background. Tonight I asked if we could vc, to which no one replied (mind you it‚Äôs only 2 other people who are in the chat). I deleted the message after getting upset by no response shortly after. For the rest of the few hours we played I got myself into a deeper depression about it, screaming into my microphone about how I needed someone to calm me down and to at least have someone else to talk to. 

I don‚Äôt mean to sound like they are fully in the wrong, but a simple message saying they couldn‚Äôt chat would‚Äôve been fine. I don‚Äôt want to loose them as they are the only people I really have, but my emotions seem to be more overpowering than usual. ",1,1734394498.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

For the first leg of the trip, we stayed at [this ](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1144069200533461278?source_impression_id=p3_1733937986_P3Hf-z0lNt89mudB)Airbnb.¬† We truly loved this place, and the location.¬† It‚Äôs so nice to have all of the space of an apartment to spread your stuff out when traveling abroad, having a washer and dryer is really a wonderful plus as well. This place is located in a very pleasant part of town just a block or two east of Pigalle.  I will be recommending it to anyone who ever tells me they‚Äôre going to Paris.¬† 

Friday morning we arrived and after checking into our Airbnb, went directly to **Mamiche**.¬† We were enchanted by a hot & toasty, and knew immediately it would be our local go-to.¬† After a nap, we did the trip up the hill to Sacre-Coeur, then ventured south to the Tuileries Christmas Market.¬† It‚Äôs really great.¬† There are rides, food vendors, people selling trinkets, really just everything you would want from a market.¬† We enjoyed that quite a bit.¬† We ended our evening at **Le Bon Bock** back in Montmartre, which is terrible.¬† It‚Äôs a cool looking restaurant that does seem very old inside, but the food sucks.¬† My girlfriend and I both were so excited to have a French meal again, and both felt quite disappointed by our meals.  
  
The next morning **Mamiche** had too long of a line, so I wandered down to **Leonie** and got some croissants and such while my girlfriend got ready for the Catacombs- I think Leonie is great, especially for a place that seems like a chain.¬† They also have a very pleasant covered patio.¬† Really nice boulangerie for a quick stop.¬† After we did Catacombs, we went over to the Marais and went to **Guerrisol** for some thrifting, which I‚Äôd seen as a recommendation on this sub.¬† It was just fine, a very pleasant little shop.¬† We wandered over to **Motors Coffee** afterwards, but they don‚Äôt have iced coffee (said it‚Äôs ‚ÄúAn American thing‚Äù) so we continued on our way to **Marche Enfants Rouge**.¬† This place has gotten too big for its britches.¬† Every single place is slammed, and the places popular online like **Les Enfants du Marche**, **Butcher of Paris** and **Chez Alain Miam Miam** are PACKED all with long lines.¬† Personally, I would suggest skipping this whole thing. Even **Character Cochon** had a 10 person line that wasn‚Äôt moving, and although that sandwich has a special place in my heart, I left without.¬† Luckily though, that took us to **Dumbo**.¬† Oh Dumbo, I could write this whole piece just about you.¬† Perfect crispy smashburger patty with the most pillowy potato bun.¬† Absolutely magical.¬† One of my top recommendations if you‚Äôre in the Marais or Montmartre- and if you‚Äôre like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to eat a burger on my trip to France,‚Äù you‚Äôre missing out.¬†

  
Okay so after that we wandered over to Place des Vosges and my girlfriend wanted a hot chocolate.¬† You already know Carrette has a 30 person line, so we wandered nextdoor to **Serpent a Plume** and it was very pleasant.¬† Not the best hot chocolate in the world, but a nice experience sitting watching the park.¬† **Brigat** was our next stop as it was our home bakery last time we came, so we got a quick pastry (always good from Brigat) and went on our way.¬† That evening was dinner at **Chez Monsieur** which may have been the best meal in Paris on that trip.¬† They have a veal blanquette that will make you want to bathe in it.¬† Absolutely fantastic.¬† After dinner we did something which I just cannot possibly recommend more- **Helios Orchestra at La Madeleine Church**.¬† That church is absolutely stunning, and the orchestra + a 100 person choir performing in it is a life experience I will never forget.¬† I am a guy that likes death metal and UFC fights, so definitely not the target demographic- and found myself tearing up on multiple occasions at the beauty of all of it.¬† If that‚Äôs happening while you‚Äôre in Paris, GO.¬† Then we wandered past the window displays at Galeries Lafayette, which are very cute during Christmas.¬† Worth a stop.

Sunday morning was breakfast at **Pain Pain** which is fantastic.¬† Very high quality boulangerie on a nice little side street.¬† Loved the aesthetic of their packaging too, cool place.¬† We went to the Louvre after and I spent much time telling my girlfriend I knew of a secret entrance that wouldn‚Äôt be busy (Porte des Lions) and it was closed, so we had to walk all the way back across and enter at the top pyramid like goofs.¬† It was great, it‚Äôs the Louvre.¬† People inside are the most clueless and ignorant humans I‚Äôve encountered anywhere in my life.¬† You know how when you walk into Costco you‚Äôre like ‚ÄúDid everyone get a lobotomy when they walked in here?‚Äù¬† The Louvre is that x100.¬† We had lunch at some Italian place close that sucked, then went home and took a nap.¬† Dinner that night was at **Peppe Martyrs**, and we were excited because he had just again won the best pizza thing.¬† The Peppe in Latin Quarter was one of my favorite meals last year, so expectations were high.¬† This place was not good.¬† We felt everything to be fairly low quality, and seemed very unprofessional top to bottom, ran mostly by people in their early 20s.¬† Not sure if it‚Äôs just the location or what, but I would avoid PM.¬†

If you‚Äôre still reading this, on Monday my girlfriend and I were fighting so I did some adventuring alone üòä¬†It happens when you travel abroad. I sat at the Leonie, had breakfast on the patio and watched Paris for an hour or so, which I really enjoy. They have a great patio.¬† After I went to **Centre Pompidou,** which I thought sucked last time I went.¬† This time I went and honestly I still think it sucks.¬† I will probably get some hate on here for saying it, but it‚Äôs really not a great museum.¬† Skip it and go almost anywhere else in Paris, although they do have a great view from the top floor.¬† Okay so next I went to the **Opera**, and I‚Äôve got a hot take there too.¬† It‚Äôs fine, but the experience is completely ruined by people with main character syndrome dressed up in some god awful over the top outfit, getting their pictures taken leaning over the balcony and having cringe photoshoots.¬† The amount of obnoxious, un-self aware people that have taken over that space is obscene.¬† If you‚Äôre dressed up in a ball gown making some guy take pictures of you while you visit the opera, you straight up suck ass.¬† It‚Äôs so gross.¬† Avoid at all costs, you can see the fancy hallway with all the chandeliers online, and there are about 50 rooms like that all over Paris.¬†  
Okay so my girlfriend and I have made up again (we agreed it was my fault) and we go to **Abuela‚Äôs** in Montmartre for dinner which is fantastic.¬† Just a stellar Spanish meal, and at a very fair price.  Do not skip the garlic shrimp.¬† We also went to **Puffy Cookies**‚Ä¶ dear god.¬† Puffy cookies is something magical.¬† If you‚Äôre anywhere in Paris, honestly if you‚Äôre visiting London, take the tube across and go to Puffy cookies.¬† That evening we also went to the La Defense Christmas market which is really lame.¬† Totally soulless, my least favorite part of the trip.¬†

Tuesday was Mamiche again (they‚Äôd been closed for a couple days) then off to Galeries Lafayette to see the tree.¬† The tree is great, there‚Äôs too many people in there.¬† Then we went down to the Latin Quarter and just happened to wander into the **Cluny**, which was largely closed but was happy to sell us two full price tickets without telling us.¬† Many people walking around confused as to why they can‚Äôt find the way out to the rest of the museum, and that‚Äôs because they were all closed off.¬† Didn‚Äôt love that.¬† I took my sorrows over to my favorite croissant in Paris at **La Maison D‚ÄôIsabelle**, and it was just wonderful.¬† They make a perfect croissant which is really just a full stick of butter wrapped in flaky dough.¬† Fantastic.¬† We wandered **Rue Mouffetard** after which I think most people could probably skip, then went back home.¬† I got Puffy Cookies and Dumbo again.¬† Dinner that night was at **Alfis** down by Tuileries garden, neither my girlfriend or I thought it was very good.¬†  
  
I then went to Ghent->Amsterdam->Eindhoven->Westerlo-> and back to Paris

I returned back to Paris Wednesday evening to spend a few days there with my mother.¬† She's heard me rave about Paris, but had only gone with me while I was still in grade school.  She didn't enjoy her time there, so it's her 70th birthday, and I wanted to show her the Paris I thought she would enjoy.  We stayed in the Latin Quarter at the **Hotel Parc St-Severin**, which I have mixed feelings on.¬† The staff is fantastic, the location is fantastic, and the breakfast is stellar.¬† The problem is the rooms and the elevator are extremely small, and the bathtub/shower mix is tiny and slick- just seemed like an accident waiting to happen the whole time, I was honestly concerned about my mother using it.¬† Also it was fairly loud outside, which is not something that generally bothers me- but people were screaming outside in the courtyard at all hours which gets old pretty quick.¬† For the price, I‚Äôd probably pick somewhere else if I had to do it again.

My mother and I had **Polidor** for dinner, and although it was packed and the service was horrible, the food was actually very good.¬† They pack that place out, so if that bothers you just keep it in mind.¬†

  
Thursday morning I took my mom to **LV Dream** as she's a big fan of Louis, and I found it quite disappointing.  I went last year and they had a great selection of purses with various artist renditions, and this year seemed quite sparing.  They had a couple rooms of furniture, and then like six of those hanging egg chairs that look like patio furniture with various low effort themes, but very dramatic explanations.   Then took mom to Galeries Lafayette and there were too many people inside (she loved it), and we wandered into **Lou Cantou**, which was absolutely fantastic.¬† A stellar meal, would definitely recommend if you‚Äôre going to Galeries Lafayette or the Opera.¬† Tucked into a little side street and seemed to be filled with locals, as much as it can be for that area.¬† I then took her through the Army Museum just to see all the suits of armor and the Napoleon Tomb (worth a visit), and we had dinner that evening at **Bistrot Rocaille** which was amazing.¬† Tiny place, single waiter, fantastic food.¬† Top notch.

Okay this is the longest post of all time, it‚Äôs Friday, and my mom and I head to Reims for the Veuve Cliquot ‚ÄúCliquot in the snow Last dinner of the year.‚Äù¬† So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to include this part because I wasn‚Äôt able to find any info on something similar when I was researching before.¬† This is a 5 course dinner and champagne pairing in a Veuve cellar, 200 euros a head.¬† The positive is that it‚Äôs pretty much all you can drink champagne, and they bring out some good bottles.¬† The negative is that the food is pretty bad, and the whole experience seems pretty half baked.¬† Seems like they just get whatever Veuve decorations they have lying around, put them in a room, and serve you food that I would put about on par with a museum caf√©.¬† This all may be what I should have been expecting, I‚Äôve never done anything like this, but I went in totally blind and that was my experience.¬† For what it‚Äôs worth, my mom loved it- but she got fairly lit up.¬†  There were some uncomfortable statements made about race by the end, it was that much champagne.  

Side note, the Notre Dame in Reims is one of the most amazing cathedrals I‚Äôve ever seen.¬† It‚Äôs a 40 minute train ride and honestly worth it just for that- seriously unreal.¬†  
  
Okay guys, we‚Äôre on the last day of the trip.¬† I went to **Chipotle** for lunch when we got back.¬† Man did I enjoy that.¬† Then I went to **Bo&Mie** and got a cookie shot.¬† I really think their stuff is not usually very good, but that cookie shot is amazing.¬† A big cylinder of cookie filled with melted milk chocolate.¬† If you wander past a B&M, do yourself a favor and get a cookie shot.¬† To wrap up the trip I went to see **Dying Fetus** at Elysee Montmartre and I teared up the whole time like a teenage girl seeing Taylor Swift.¬† I felt so much joy to have a life that includes getting to see DF in Paris, I‚Äôm a lucky guy.¬† Then I went to **Dumbo** again and got two burgers.¬†

  
That's it!  A few tips I have kept in mind.

\- I would recommend getting a phone case that can give your phone extra battery, like a Mophie Juice Pack.  You burn your phone battery so fast navigating and taking pictures and translating, that having some extra power is very helpful.

\- Apple maps has been more accurate than Google maps for me getting around and for business hours.

\- Use the Bonjour RATP app to buy your metro tickets, and I actually put two cards in my apple wallet because sometimes a turnstile scans your phone, doesn't open, then tells you you already used that card when you try to do it again.  So I would have one with most of my tickets, then one with a couple spares.  

\- Most museums have coat checks.  They are **free**.  Use them.  

\- Learning ""hello"", ""goodbye"", ""I would like"", and 1-10 in French will put you in the 99th percentile of tourists and will make your life vastly easier.  ",6,1734394185.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False

You can call me Quick Kangaroo.  I am a 28 years old Canadian (yes, the rumor is true, we are nice people :P). I'm an introvert who's trying to get out there. I also have social anxiety and I'm slowly working on that too. 

I love love love to read. I enjoy reading thrillers, true crime, and romance. If ever you fancy a buddy read, I am totally up for it. 

I love to watch tv shows. I just need a good snack and I'm good to go for the night (that also means I watch shows instead of sleeping and then complain about why I don't get enough sleep woops). I love all these shows: The Office, Gilmore Girls, New Girls, Friends. Black Mirror, Modern Family, Schitt Creek and plenty more. 

I also enjoy watching k-dramas. I have watched a few and absolutely love them. 

I like to explore my city, visiting cafes and currently enjoying the winter weather. I don't drink coffee but I enjoy the vibes of cafes. 

I am not a gamer but I do enjoy playing a few games online like chess, challenging myself with world maps and such. I love to do puzzles and play soduku. 

I am very open so we can discuss anything at all. Let's motivate each other to set new goals and achieve greatness! I don't have a preference over snail or email. I enjoy both! I love reading long letters and writing a lot so don't be shy to write a long text. 

I am on vacation for a few starting now so I would love to take the time to meet new people, build awesome friendships. Shoot me a message if you think we will vibe. ",2,1734394173.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had a few issues with my tongue the past week. Last week I had what almost looked like a very small cut with a little white stuff on too (smaller than pencil eraser). It seemed to appear after eating and be gone when I woke up the next day. Also had a clear lump on the inside of my cheek that seemed to go away as the day went on. 

My tongue is kind of beige in the photo because I just drank coffee. Now, I have this red patch on the same side of my tongue but in a different area. It also seemed to have appeared after eating (in assuming so because it also feels odd, not painful but I can feel it‚Äôs there and I didn‚Äôt have that feeling before eating). It‚Äôs red and kind of indented compared to the area around it. It‚Äôs more noticeable in person than it is in the photo. 

I have poor oral hygeine due to brushing my teeth infrequently. I also am on an elimination diet and have been adding in dairy products the last three weeks after not eating them for a couple of years. Besides that, nothing is really new.

1hfxios,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hfxios/hm_pet_night/,[HM] Pet Night,"Matt and I stepped into my tiny, crimson Subaru. I pressed the ignition. The car roared to life and I turned on the brights. It was nighttime in Rocky Valley, after all, a town of about 3,000. Nobody usually drives at midnight.¬†

We don‚Äôt converse for around five minutes. We‚Äôre both just enjoying our oversweetened coffee, or trying to. Mack‚Äôs Drive thru was the only place with coffee open at that time of night. It‚Äôs so atrociously bitter and trashy we dump around five sugar packets in it. It doesn‚Äôt really help.

Matt started searching around. Frantically.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you doing? Lost a sugar packet?‚Äù I question him.

‚ÄúNo, there‚Äôs just this rattling, or-or shifting,‚Äù he responds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like paper or something sliding.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCheck under your seat,‚Äù I suggest, ‚ÄúIt sounds like it‚Äôs coming from there.‚Äù As Matt reaches under he feels around for a while and then pulls out a crinkled piece of paper.

‚ÄúPet Night: Bring a pet! Toddlers get to show them to each other!‚Äù he read off the paper.¬†

All of a sudden my eyes widened. Pet Night. The memories‚Ä¶ the horror. I put the car in park on the side of the road.

Matt was confused. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you sto-‚Äù

‚ÄúGive me that!‚Äù I yelled. He handed it to me reluctantly, and I ripped it out of his hands. My eyes scanned over it in utter terror. ‚ÄòPet Night: Bring a pet! Toddlers‚Ä¶ Wednesday the 23rd at Rocky Valley Baptist Church‚Ä¶ Ages 2-7‚Ä¶Planned by our new Childrens‚Äô Pastor: Peter Wilk.‚Äô

As I looked up at Matt, he noticed the shaking of my hands.

‚ÄúWhat is it? What‚Äôs that paper about?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to know,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúTell me: What was ‚ÄòPet night‚Äô? And why did the idea of it scare you?‚Äù he inquired of me.

‚ÄúNot the ‚Äòidea of it‚Äô,‚Äù I explained, ‚Äúthe memories of it. That event was THE MOST DISASTEROUS thing to ever happen in Rocky Valley.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúexactly what happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúIt all started 20 years ago, back when I was in my early 20s. I was fresh out of St. Anthony‚Äôs Bible institute, and recently got hired as a childrens‚Äô pastor at the local church, Rocky Valley Baptist Church. The original Childrens‚Äô Pastor left to move to Florida and watch his grandkids grow up, so I was taking up his position.¬†¬†

None of the little kids knew me, and so, me having no knowledge about ministry at ALL, (or it appears common sense in general) I decided to hold a ‚ÄòPet night‚Äô, where kids ages 2-7 could bring all their pets to show.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, hold up,‚Äù Matt replied, ‚Äúyou thought it was a GOOD IDEA to let a bunch of chaotic little kids bring LIVE PETS to an event??.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know,‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúIt was stupid. But anyways, this is when the story gets REALLY awful. So, on that night, that awful Wednesday night, kids brought their pets. And there were a LOT. One kid brought 4 gerbils.

I was waiting for the kids to arrive in the event room, and the first to come was Johnny, a five year old (I‚Äôd memorized their names prior). He was holding 2 identical cats.

‚ÄòHey, Johnny! What‚Äôs up, man! Nice to meet you!‚Äô I started talking to him, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm your new leader.‚Äô

‚ÄòThis is Fluffy and Fluffy dos!‚Äô he held up one cat, and then the other, ‚Äòthey‚Äôre twins! But they don‚Äôt get along.‚Äô All of a sudden Fluffy‚Ä¶ or Fluffy dos‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure which one, started hissing at the other. Before I had time to respond, I saw Drew- a 7 year old- running in with something behind his back.

‚ÄòHi, I‚Äôm your new leader!‚Äô I introduced myself again, ‚ÄòNice to meet yo-‚Äô

‚ÄòHold out your hand! And close your eyes!‚Äô He yelled.

‚ÄòOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù I closed my eyes and stuck out my hand reluctantly. Was it a pet bird? Or a frog? All of a sudden I felt a multitude of hairy legs on my hand. I opened my eyes, and-tarantula! Instinctively I chucked that thing across the room. All of a sudden Drew started crying. Turns out-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou killed the kid‚Äôs pet!?! And it splattered on the whiteboard?!?!‚Äù Matt exclaimed.

‚ÄúUhh‚Ä¶ yeeeaaah.‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù I continued, ‚ÄúThe kid started crying after he saw his pet spider make a whiteboard into a redboard. I was freaking out, so I told him the pet was fine and he just needed a doctor. I wiped up the spider with a paper towel and said I‚Äôd rush him to the hospital. I threw the paper towel in the trash, and hoped that he would forget. But when I was distracted-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a horrible person, you know that?‚Äù Matt said.

‚ÄúIt was just an arachnid. He probably forgot all about it in 2 days.‚Äù I responded. 	‚ÄúOR you gave trauma to a little kid,‚Äù he responded.

‚ÄúOkay, okay, either way, let me continue.‚Äù I resumed telling the story. ‚ÄúWhere was I? Oh yeah, but while I was distracted by the spider thing, two more kids came in. James didn‚Äôt have a pet, so he started weeping. Julie had a snail, and apparently she found it in the bushes at her house an hour ago because she was looking for a pet, and so she decided to bring it.¬†

All of a sudden Fluffy and Fluffy dos got into an UGLY fight. Claws scratched, hair flew, and the hissing was abundant. Fluffy or Fluffy dos, I‚Äôm not sure who, ran away and ran up the ladder where a ceiling panel was being fixed. It was removed, so the cat ran up and into the ceiling.

By now I was freaking out, so-‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling me that there was just a cat in the ceiling and still is?‚Äù Matt asked, shocked.

‚ÄúWell, not still, but I‚Äôll tell you about that later,‚Äù I replied. 	‚ÄúCan we finish this story at my place?‚Äù asked Matt, ‚Äúbecause the lights and heat on is definitely taking a toll on your car battery, and besides, it‚Äôs kind of eerie out here in the dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I agreed.¬†

I put the car into drive and then rode for 5 minutes, until we got to Matt‚Äôs wood cabin. I pulled up the gravel driveway, and then we stepped out and walked up to the polished cedarwood front door. Matt cycled through his keys until he found the right one, than turned the knob and opened the door.

As we went inside the scent of pine entered my nose, and warm air hit me. He led me to the frosted glass coffee table next to the fireplace.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúcontinue.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it,‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúWhere was I? Did I get to the Kool-aid yet? Or the gerbils?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you were at the part after one of the cats went into the ceiling,‚Äù he informed me.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúso one of the Fluffys went into the ceiling. For the sake of this story the one in the ceiling will be Fluffy, and the other will be Fluffy dos.

So after that Stella- a three year old, brought in FOUR GERBILS. There names were‚Ä¶ let me think‚Ä¶ oh yeah! There was Squeaker, Sqibbles, Sqaker, and Squash. They all had different patterns and colors, but I don‚Äôt remember any of them. They all started crawling all over the floor, and I had to make sure not to step on them as they did this.¬†¬†

All of a sudden, I heard a hiss, and then a gulp. Fluffy dos had eaten Squash, and now I was just praying that Stella wouldn‚Äôt notice.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you see a cat KILL A GERBIL and eat it, and your solution is not to cancel the whole thing, but to try and hide it from a three year old until the night‚Äôs over?!?‚Äù Matt exclaimed.

‚ÄúWell, when you put it that way‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you put it ANY WAY it sounds bad, Pete!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOkay, okay,‚Äù I admitted, ‚ÄúI was probably the dumbest ever 20 years ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bit of an understatement,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúOkay, okay, I get it,‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúBut please don‚Äôt interrupt so much. I want to tell the story. Anyways, it was toatal chaos by then. Fluffy was in the ceiling, Fluffy dos was eating gerbils that were running rampid, Drew‚Äôs tarantula was in the trash and he kept asking, ‚Äòis the hospital done yet?‚Äô, James was still crying from his lack of a pet, and Julie had just LOST HER SNAIL. How do you LOSE A SNAIL?!?

I knew what I had to do. I had to fix this. Immediately I picked up Fluffy dos before he could eat Squibbles too (which was a near impossible task because of the sheer weight of that cat), took him to an empty room, and closed the door. He could come out when it was over.

As I was about to fix the rest of the issues, I saw that two more kids had joined our fun little disaster. Tommy- a 6 year old- brought a chihuahua in, and Ruth-a 5 year old- had a parrot. The chihuahua ran up to me and started biting me on the leg.

‚ÄòAAAGHH!!! GET THIS THING OFF!‚Äô I shouted.

‚ÄòHe does this to my dad all the time at home,‚Äô Tommy explained, ‚ÄòHe only gets off when I say- wait, what is it again? Begins with a T‚Ä¶‚Äô

‚ÄòJust say it, kid!!!‚Äô I shouted, ‚ÄòTortilla, trash, tarp, to-‚Äô the dog bit down harder, ‚ÄòOW!!‚Äô

‚ÄòWhat was it‚Ä¶‚Äô Tommy thought for a second, ‚ÄòOh yeah! Tangarine!‚Äô All of a sudden the dog let go of my leg. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt say it again, because it‚Äôs also the attack word.

‚ÄòTangarine!‚Äô the parrot squaked! The dog bit my leg again.¬†

‚ÄòAAAGGHH!‚Äô I shouted, ‚ÄòTangarine!‚Äô The dog let go.¬†

‚ÄòTanga-‚Äô I held the parrot‚Äôs beak shut so it wouldn‚Äôt say tangerine again.‚Äù	‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling me that a stupid chihuahua was able to attack and stop attacking on the command of a word?‚Äù Matt asked, ‚ÄúMan, this story‚Äôs wild.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I know. And traumatizing,‚Äù I reacted, ‚ÄúAnyways, I had to use one hand to hold this parrot‚Äôs beak shut, but I had a clever idea. I put a rubber band on the bird‚Äôs mouth to keep it shut. Worked like a charm. Okay, now I had to deal with James‚Äô crying and Drew asking about when the spider would be out of the hospital.¬†

Then I got the perfect idea. We had Pizza! It was supposed to be in 30 minutes, but I needed the kids distracted long enough to deal with the pets.¬†

‚ÄòPizza time!‚Äô I shouted, and the kids came running to the table. Since it was a small group, we only had 2 large pizzas. Cheese and pepperoni. After we prayed, each kid got 2 slices, and devoured them. I made sure the kids were okay, than helped with the animals.

I worked on getting the gerbils in one place and calming down the chihuahua. I checked on Fluffy dos, and then climbed a ladder with a flashlight in an attempt to try and find Fluffy, although I couldn‚Äôt. Then I looked for that snail. I looked everywhere.¬†

I eventually gave up and decided to come back to the kids and get a slice of cheese pizza. I opened the box and saw slimey stuff on the pizza in a trail. Then I saw it. That stupid snail was in the pizza box, and it had its slime ALL OVER the pizza.¬†

‚ÄòOh no‚Ä¶‚Äô I freaked out, ‚ÄòWho ate the cheese pizza?‚Äô Three hands went up. Johnny, Stella, and Ruth. All of a sudden they started HURLING. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I put them all in a closet and named it the ‚Äòbarf box‚Äô.¬†

By the time I did that I saw that Tommy had taken the chihuahua. He was ‚Äògiving it a bath‚Äô in the Kool Aid! It was spilling everywhere, and it was chaos.¬†

All of a sudden two kids‚Äô parents came in. They both yelled at me when they saw the chaos and dead pets.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Asked Matt, ‚Äúcan you tell me the rest of the story as we walk to my kitchen?‚Äù

‚ÄúUhh‚Ä¶ Sure!‚Äù I responded. We started walking slowly down the hallway as I talked to him.

‚ÄúAnyways,‚Äù I resumed, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember much after that, except getting yelled at by parents and seeing crying kids. Two parents sued for dead pets, one claiming their kid got PTSD from the event, and so I had to get $5,000 dollars toatal from my family to pay the upset parents.¬†

I got demoted to janitor at Rockey Valley Baptist, and now some people still hold a grudge against me. But something else wild happened, and it was 1 and a half weeks after pet night.

On a sunday morning service, we were singing ‚ÄòAmazing Grace‚Äô when all of a sudden, the old lady that always sung like an opera singer got attacked.

You see, during the song, Fluffy, the one who was in the ceiling for a week and a half, presumed dead by then, FELL THROUGH the ceiling and landed on the old lady. It scratched her up, but she was fine after that. Apparently it was feeding on the uncooked artifical Ramen packets in storage. Anyways, where are we?‚Äù Matt and I were in front of a dark room that was barely visible.

‚ÄúThe kitchen,‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúAlso, I already know the story you told me.‚Äù	

‚ÄúWhat? Why‚Äôd you waste my time than?‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúAre you trying to be annoying?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I am annoying,‚Äù he responded. All of a sudden he shoved me into the dark room. He continued in a cold voice, ‚Äúor maybe Matt isn‚Äôt my real name. Maybe I‚Äôm a guy with PTSD who wants revenge.‚Äù¬†

Drew locked the door on me.

I was trapped in that tarantula filled room for 8 hours.¬†",2,1734393643.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I've been living with this 'burden' for a while and I need a platform to express myself. I have never opened up to family or friends about issues I've struggled with in the past, I find it embarrassing and wouldn't ever want someone who loves me to worry about my struggles/challenges. 

I'm struggling to find a spouse. There's a lot going through my mind right now, apologies if parts do not make sense. I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or hope on here but at the very least I'm hoping sharing on here would somewhat make it easier for me going forward.

I've always had issues with self confidence and tend to overthink things which may explain the below.

When I was at college/university, many of my friends were in relationships. However, I was never interested in speaking to women at that stage of my life as I was not in a position to speak to their fathers/family. I did not want to waste anyone's time or have someone wait for me, without knowing when I'd get a job/save. I knew it would make me feel guilty/eat at my self consciousness if I held someone back and asked them to wait for me. I was interested in a girl at the time but never pursued due to the above. 

I then started working, Alhamdullilah I managed to secure a decent job which didn't exactly pay well but enough to get me off my feet and list a big firm on my CV. At 24, I just got caught up in the corporate world and the thought of marriage, subconsciously, rarely crosses my mind as I was fixated on my career and exams. 

Plus I always thought, 'it would just happen' one day. My friends encouraged me to create Instagram account where I'd be able to potentially meet my spouse but the concept of Instagram just does not sit well with me and approaching a girl via DMs, always felt cheap to me. 

When I turned 27, I left the role above and moved to another big 4 firm as I wanted a change in career but I was out of a job for almost a year between the two roles which meant a lot of my savings were used to maintain my life.

When I started my new job, my parents were more vocal about me getting married and initially I did not want to meet anyone through my parents however told them I was happy for them to ask around. At this point, I also created profile on the likes of Muzz, Salaams and Hinge.

I was hopeful of finding someone via the apps however I've not had any luck for two years for various reasons. I'm short, 5'6, which I've accepted puts a lot of women off and subsequently makes the pool of women I have access to even smaller. On these apps when I match someone, I either find there's a personality clash, at time I don't enjoy the conversation or feel the woman I'm speaking to is not fully interested me as there's no flow to the convo/I receive dead replies or sometimes it just comes down to deal breakers.

My main deal breakers are: zina, drugs, shisha, alcohol and revealing/unmodest clothing. Please do not advise me on compromising on my deal breakers as that's not the reason why I'm here.

I've also been attending Muslim marriage events but similar to above I find either women are not interested in me or if I do match with someone it does not last long.

One girl I met told me I was and I quite ""too respectful"". This may be because I don't flirt with women/ask for pictures as I think it's inappropriate and would like to avoid haram as much as possible. 

Another girl, we agreed to meet up for a coffee but on the day she blocked me on Whatsapp. Another girl we met up, went for food and afterwards she text me saying she had a good time but following evening she just did not respond to me. I text her few days later to see if she was okay or just was not interested however I never got a response.

I know I probably should not say this however I feel like I've lost hope. Like everything else in my life, it just seems it's not written for me or I have to struggle to attain it.

Whether it's because I'm short, introverted, not flirtatious, maybe my job is not good enough for them, maybe I'm picky when it comes to looks, maybe I just don't have a great personality, 'too nice' which puts in the friend zone....I just don't know what it is.

It's hard, like I said I never open up to anyone ever. Now, I'm just tired. Tired of being lonely, tired of not being able to have someone I can speak to about what's going on in my head and tired of being turned down which has further impacted my confidence. My siblings/friends are all married and have children and it's the most beautiful and heartwarming sight to see. I yearn for that too.",5,1734393445.0,MuslimNikah,2,1.0,False

The final day to complete the project is December 17th, and it‚Äôs due for submission on December 18th at 10 AM. Today, one of the girls said she was extremely tired and wanted to go home, but we are all tired and still pushing through. I had agreed to write the conclusion, but I also worked on other tasks.

When someone asked her if she could review the conclusion while I was making corrections, she got irritated, raised her voice, and said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs your task! And Im very tired.‚Äô And kept saying the same again and again. But this is a group project, not an individual one. She only works on her assigned tasks and doesn‚Äôt care about the rest. Even when we were working on tables earlier, she refused to collaborate, and now we‚Äôve ended up with completely different tables in the project. And we even had a conversation not long ago WE HELP EACHOTHER.

She also claimed she hadn‚Äôt taken any breaks, but and we did many, but she clearly did ‚Äì to eat, make coffee, use the bathroom, and chat with us. On top of that, she made it indirectly sound like she‚Äôs been working harder than the rest of us. For example, I suggested we meet at 8 AM today, and she showed up before us ‚Äì but only because the buses were delayed. And honestly, it‚Äôs the first time she‚Äôs arrived earlier than us she was there for like 30 min before we came but she was like ‚ÄúI was there before all of you‚Äù üòÇ

I‚Äôm upset because two of the girls once pulled an all-nighter at the university, working from one morning to the next, while I was at work (but did my task on work computer), and she was at the cinema. And today, that same girl, along with another one, just packed their stuff and left, even though they knew how much work we still had left. What makes it worse is that the second girl wasn‚Äôt even tired or said anything, she just started packing her stuff!!!

Meanwhile, those two girls who stayed up all night come from different cities and commute by train. They‚Äôve put in so much effort, yet others don‚Äôt seem to take the project as seriously. 

I usually don‚Äôt raise my voice, but today I got very angry. Am doing too much or Am I allowed to be this angry, or should I tell them tomorrow morning how upset I am about all of this??? Cause I didnt say anything to the other girl when she left, because Im already pissed and knew I would be waaaay less nice. But she even left the other two girls when they pulled an all nighter!!

1hfwyow,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1hfwyow/how_i_use_modafinil_to_cope_with_chronic_pain/,How I use modafinil to cope with chronic pain,"\*\*\* Repost because I'm noticing an increase in posts about chronic fatigue and lack of energy.

I used to suffer from severe chronic fatigue, but don't anymore. The medication I'm about to discuss is called modafinil (also goes by the brand name, Provigil). It's a mild stimulant that can make chronic pain more bearable by improving debilitating fatigue, enhancing cognition, and inducing heightened productivity. You can find a lot of discussion about it on r/Biohackers, r/modafinil, and r/Nootropics.

I've taken modafinil for the past 7 years. In that time, I've been able to achieve some pretty remarkable things: I can function more easily, my mind has been sharper, and I've actually increased my income by 430% by working harder and earning promotions. Overall, I feel happier and less prone to depression. Of course, a drug alone is not responsible for these things ‚Äî I am. But the medication helped make it possible for me to push myself further than I previously could. This push has helped me to recreate meaning in my life that was once lost.

Modafinil is not a pain treatment per se, but for some people, it can measurably improve quality of life. Biohackers have been using it for decades to more easily hold down a job, overcome depression, and perform physical tasks that are normally too taxing due to pain. Modafinil is NOT an amphetamine. It is not in any way related to Adderall. However, for some people, it can produce a mild stimulant effect. In my case, I limit my coffee to just 2 oz and take chelated magnesium oxide, which suppresses any anxiety due to its effects. Bio-hacking communities often suggest taking an l-theanine supplement to curb anxiety caused by modafinil, if it occurs. Anyone taking this drug should limit their caffeine and never consume energy drinks.

Before I get into the details, a quick disclaimer: this is not medical advice. What works for some people may not work for you. You should talk to your doctor to discuss potential new therapies. Here's a guide on¬†[how to get a doctor to listen to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/17ajr18/how_to_get_doctors_to_take_you_seriously/).

**What is modafinil?**

Modafinil is classified as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. It works by altering the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, like dopamine, that control mood and wakefulness.

**What conditions does it treat?**

Modafinil is used to treat a multitude of conditions, many of which are considered ""off-label"". They include:

* Chronic fatigue
* Depression
* Narcolepsy
* Shift work disorder
* Obstructive sleep apnea (as an adjunct to CPAP therapy)
* ADHD
* Muscular dystrophy

**How can it help chronic pain?**

While modafinil isn't a direct pain treatment, it can improve pain symptoms by alleviating the things that make pain worse. Half the battle of dealing with chronic pain is just pushing through it. For many people, modafinil makes that possible, while providing mood and cognition enhancing effects.

**Relief from chronic fatigue:**¬†Modafinil can provide relief from debilitating fatigue without the harsh side effects of an amphetamine like Adderall. Fibromylagia patients have reported¬†[feeling ""functional"" again](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/jnp.13.4.530).

**Enhanced cognitive function:**¬†Studies have shown that modafinil significantly improves attention, executive functions, and learning abilities. Hence, why it's often referred to as the ""smart drug"".

**Increased productivity:**¬†The author of¬†[this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/03/brain-enhancing-drugs-mj-hyland)¬†reported feeling ""twice as productive and considerably happier"".

**Reducing depression:**¬†Modafinil has been shown to¬†[reduce the severity of depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16035049/)¬†more effectively than antidepressants alone. It can also be used an a monotherapy for depression.

**What are the potential side effects?**  
Modafinil is generally well-tolerated. For those who experience side effects, they can include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Anxiety
* Insomnia
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea

**Considerations:**

Anyone trying modafinil for the first time should avoid too much caffeine (just 2 ounces of coffee ends up being enough for me!) It also goes without saying to stay away from energy drinks. Using these together with modafinil can cause an unsafe high heart rate. As previously mentioned, people often take it with either magnesium oxide or l-theanine for a calming effect.

**How can you try it?**

If you're interested in trying an approach like this, but aren't sure how to get your doctor to listen, here is a breakdown of¬†[exactly what to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/17ajr18/how_to_get_doctors_to_take_you_seriously/).

Trying modafinil requires a doctor's prescription and a diagnosis of something that it treats, such as chronic fatigue or major depressive disorder. It is a controlled substance and you cannot safely buy it online.

Beyond bars and cafes, what are your favourite activities to do and meet with new people?","I (21F) Just got home after a great meetup with someone I connected with through this sub!

During our conversation, we started wondering: what else is there to do in Berlin? This person is very new in Germany, and while showing this person places, a few activities (cinema, Christmas market, roller skating) I realised I don‚Äôt really know what else to do. I had ‚Äúexhausted‚Äù my options.

It feels like every time I see someone looking for meetups here, the go-to suggestions are always ‚Äúgrab a drink,‚Äù ‚Äúget coffee,‚Äù or ‚Äúgo clubbing.‚Äù And while there‚Äôs nothing wrong with those options (Berlin is a party hotspot, after all), I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Ä¶ what other activities are there for meeting people? Specifically, stuff that doesn‚Äôt involve drinking (alcohol or otherwise), clubbing, or just sitting down to eat.

I totally get why those are common suggestions‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre affordable, easy, and a good way to break the ice. But is there anything more creative, fun, or engaging that people recommend, especially for breaking out of the typical meet-and-greet mold?

For example, I‚Äôm thinking about things like:

	‚Ä¢	Pottery caf√©s or sip-and-paint sessions

	‚Ä¢	Archery clubs or indoor skydiving

	‚Ä¢	Horseback riding

	‚Ä¢	Themed events (dress up as Cleopatra or a figure from ancient Mongolia, anyone?)

	‚Ä¢	Skating rinks

	‚Ä¢	Book clubs, or even cookbook clubs where you take turns preparing dishes from different cultures

I‚Äôm curious if locals in Berlin know of any specific places or events for these kinds of activities: or even other ideas I haven‚Äôt thought of! I know Google is an option, but personal recommendations from people who‚Äôve actually been there are always better.

For context: I‚Äôve been living here for almost three years, but my time has mostly been about work. I‚Äôm finally ready to branch out and explore the city while meeting new people. It‚Äôs just hard to feel excited about meeting folks when the plan always revolves around food or drinks. (Like, I have food at home, and honestly, I‚Äôd rather eat that than risk paying for a restaurant meal I don‚Äôt enjoy.)

So, if you have any unique ideas for activities in Berlin‚Ä¶ or places where people can meet and actually do something; please let me know!",2,1734391462.0,berlinsocialclub,20,0.63,False

1hfwlpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hfwlpr/aitah_for_seeming_unappreciative_of_a_gift/,AITAH for seeming unappreciative of a gift?,"So the story is, my fianc√© (F28) and I (M29) were given an engagement present by her sister (F28) and her sister‚Äôs boyfriend (M28) over the weekend. The gift was a ski weekend- but specifically it was paying for an Airbnb for the 4 of us, as we already have season ski passes and own our own gear. It was framed as ‚Äòa gift and a celebration of us‚Äô. 

We were excited for the weekend. It‚Äôs a generous gift and should have been a lot of fun. However when we got there, it turned out they had booked a small one bedroom Airbnb, and the second sleeping option was the pull out couch in the living room. We sort of waited to see if they‚Äôd be offering us the bedroom, but they immediately say ‚Äòyou guys are on the pullout‚Äô and took the bedroom for themselves. The pullout was horrendous. Creaky, springs falling out as we opened it, tiny, and not at all level. We ended up just sleeping on the floor the second night because we both had horrendous back pain after the first morning, and got maybe 3 hours of sleep total. The whole Airbnb was maybe 600 sq ft, so sleeping in the living room was literally no privacy whatsoever, and when they walked into the living room to use the bathroom it woke us up. 

I‚Äôm normally not one to complain about being on a pullout for a weekend. But the weekend was supposed to be a gift to us, so we felt like it‚Äôs reasonable to have expected the bedroom. No part of me thought it wouldn‚Äôt be a two bedroom or that we would at least have a comfortable sleeping situation for the weekend. 

In addition, in the mornings my fianc√© and I were trying to sleep in a little, have a slower morning, have breakfast. But they were so forceful about getting out the door as soon as possible and getting first chair, that they ditched us and left to go ski without us while we were still getting ready. Not like we were taking hours, but just wanted 30 minutes to have our coffee and wake up before heading out. 

We were not outwardly unappreciative. We didn‚Äôt say anything about it, just slept on the floor and took it- although we may have been a little reserved over the weekend and I may have mentioned how bad my back hurt while skiing once or twice. But we said thank you for the weekend and were cordial the whole time. Just not super enthusiastic.

After getting back, we find out that they‚Äôre upset with us because apparently we weren‚Äôt appreciative enough of the gift. It really felt like a gift they got themselves and we were just invited to sleep on their floor as an afterthought. We asked to leave early on Sunday when they wanted to keep skiing, which to be honest was because my back was killing me and we were exhausted from no sleep. Not that I said that was the reason. 

So I agree we weren‚Äôt thanking them the whole weekend for the generous gift, and weren‚Äôt as enthusiastic as they probably hoped we would be- but we did say thank you, were polite, etc. And I still feel like our opinions on the weekend are valid. So AITAH? I‚Äôm deciding how I should approach talking to them. Be sorry for not seeming more appreciative and chalking it up to bad sleep? Or explain that we didn‚Äôt feel prioritized with a weekend meant as a gift to us?",0,1734391068.0,AITAH,12,0.5,False

Going on 3 weeks and 3 days of a wet cough, doesn't seem to get any better

Nov 23rd - Had 2 unexpected acid reflux come up my throat with a burning feeling, both times only because I was bending over to pick up something, but then never happened again. I don't really have GERD issues normally. But for the first 2 weeks, I assumed it was Gerd related or that the acid burned up my throat so I started taking antacids & famotidine with a mix of cough syrup, also stopped taking Advil, coffee, soda, etc. But my throat still felt tight all throughout. I wasn't improving so I started taking Nexium and Gaviscon for 6 days. Don't think it did anything. 

Also been on thousands of lozenges, ginger teas, honey. 

Was confused about Gerd because I eat pretty healthy and exercise everyday, I also do intermittent fasting. Also did Covid test and was negative.

It went from a really itchy throat 24/7 to now I don't feel it as much but still coughing. Sometimes I had headaches from the cough. I have tried taking Loratadine to see if can be allergies from the heat being turned on or dust. Still no improvement.

The whole time I've had no other symptoms, no throat pain (like I usually have with sore throat), never felt tired (except from lack of sleep the first week from coughing all night), no shortness of breath, no trouble swallowing, no muscle pain. I have been able to continue my workout routine with the same intensity as always. My lungs always seemed fine to me so I assumed it was only throat related. Only thing happens when I exercise is I start coughing up phlegm due to my throat getting filled with mucus. 

Only big concern now is the phlegm being thick & yellow. Looks exactly like how snots looks like. And the cough has a deepness to it. Was thinking it would be gone in a few days of coughing up and clearing out the mucus but it's been a good 7-9 days of it now. ",2,1734390749.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

I have hit 191 on Wegovy 1.0 for almost a year, i'm down from 245 when i started wegovy and I did 6 months on saxenda before. I am down from 280 my highest weight ever and have a GW of 170. 

I have been doing a lot of strength training I do not have excess skin except some on my stomach and have gotten very toned legs and arms and shoulders(!)--however my face is starting to not look great and I am getting self conscious about it. I've always had very gorgeous skin on my face especially, i know fat loss causes a youth decline look. I have been using vital proteins in my coffee, i have tried drunk elephant polypeptide cream and whipped moisturizer and eye cream for about year for my face it's super expensive and I am not seeing any results. I have also tried glossier, and am now trying cera ve. I'm so happy with how everything else has been going but i really want to try and help my skin on my face and I am wondering if anyone has done anything that has been working? I am dermaplaning now too! 

  
I also lost a lot hair density with weight loss--i had very thick hair and it really thinned out massively. I read this was normal and I got a densifying hair shampoo which seems to be working well. 

  
Anyways, anyone who had something that they like for their face and is working for them, i'd love to know. Thank you!",1,1734390181.0,WegovyWeightLoss,2,1.0,False

","*Using a throwaway, fyi.*

I just started dating 2 months ago, and it made me realize I can't get over the idea that my future wife will likely have had been with another man before me.

For context, I've remained a virgin due to personal and religious values growing up, I just always thought it was something you save for marriage. I had a relationship in my teens but we kept ourselves from going that far because we shared the same idea on sex. Though after it ended I just focused on school and work, now I'm 23, have my own car, my own place, make good money, not trying to brag. I have gone on 6 different dates so far these past 2 months, but I always self sabotage after the idea comes up that they're not virgins.

The first date I went on with a beautiful 21yo, she seemed like she was traditional, doesn't dress provocatively, practising Christian, met her when I was visiting my old uni campus. We met up for coffee, and the date was going great, but then she brought up how she was ""celibate"" for almost a year, I asked her what that meant, because I was confused why she wouldn't just say virgin, and she basically explained it means she hasn't had sex in almost a year, implying she wasn't a virgin. Idk why but that really messed me up,my mood changed, she probably could tell. I didn't text her back, despite her texting she had a wonderful time, I couldn't because all my thoughts weren't nice.

The second was with this cute girl in her early 20s, she was teasing me that I must get a lot of women, eventually I admitted I was a virgin, and I could tell she was really off put by that, all the banter stopped, so I decided to just call her an uber, and I drove back home. Pretty much the rest of the dates I've been on, the convos all eventually escalated sexually and then I realize that they're experienced in the bedroom, and turns me off them. Idk why I kept pursuing new dates.

I did a lot of searching and thinking, heard lot of good points made by people, ultimately it is an insecurity I have. I could waste time looking for a virgin, but I'd also have to look for one I like, so I'd be severely limiting my dating pool, a woman having a body count does not change who she is. I understand this logically, but mentally can't get over it. I saw a recent post just on this sub about a guy that found videos of his girl getting railed by an ex, if that happened to me idk what would happened, maybe I'd see red and have thoughts about self deleting.

Many bros have also told me these thoughts are common but its not a big deal, and once you become really sexually experienced it doesn't bother you anymore. So some advised me to rack up a high body count until it won't bother me anymore. I'm wondering if this is what I should do, getting dates is not an issue for me, but what I fear is that it will mess me up mentally in some other way, maybe I won't see women the same way, maybe it will make me lose impulse control and more likely to cheat, maybe not even want to pursue marriage and a family anymore, idk. But this seems like the only solution.

TL;DR: Was advised to rack up a high body count to get over my insecurity of likely ending up with a non virgin.",2,1734390085.0,retroactivejealousy,13,0.75,False

I've just completed a month of ADF. (Well, fasting MWF). Though my weight dropped 9 lbs the first week, it went back up and has stayed up. I've lost next to nothing and I'm flummoxed and frustrated. I'm wondering if I need to fast longer to kickstart results. My goals are weight loss but also lowered inflammation and overall health.

I'm 42F, 199lbs ish, so a good 40lbs to lose. Last I checked a couple years ago, I was a bit insulin resistant. (I tried testing my blood glucose today but ofc my lancer broke -- but I'll start monitoring this asap.) 

I've been fasting clean MWF except a few TBsp of cream in coffee. On eating days, I'm eating 2 meals in an 8hr eating window, mostly keto, 'til comfortably full (so not binging but not restricting).

Would rolling 72's be the next thing to try, you think? Has anyone NOT lost weight on ADF but found success with rolling 72's (or something else)? Looking for some hope here.",1,1734390071.0,fasting,3,1.0,False

My head hung low as the guards marched my through the halls. My thoughts kept swirling and circling back to Zek. I hoped that she would forgive me for lying to her...

I was shoved through the door to the main bridge, many sets of eyes belonging to both Yotul and Arxur landing on me. Cthal stood in the middle of the room, watching me approach. But she wasn't alone...

Beside her was the fattest Arxur I've ever seen! She had surprisingly few scars, and looked slightly younger than the Commander, but her body was covered in stretch marks due to her weight. She looked at me with odd vitriol, as if I had personally commited a great sin against her.

The fat Arxur leaned down to look at me as I stood before her, rage blazing in her eyes.

""So, this is the bastard that decided it would be a good idea to throw a bunch of kids into space in the hopes that we'd eat them?"" The obese Arxur said.

Cthal stepped forward, planting her paw on the fat Arxur's shoulder. ""Vulthiss dear, you said we would do this my way.""

The Arxur looked back at Cthal before letting out a sigh. ""Fine... But only because I trust you."" She said before stepping back.

Cthal looked over to me. ""You must forgive my mate. She's been going through a lot recently.""

""No no. Her anger is justified..."" I replied.

I looked back over to the Arxur. ""Vulthiss"" I think her name was. It was surprising to see an Arxur as overweight as her.

*I knew the Arxur eat enough these days after the UN gave them the ability to make lab-grown meat, but did they really have so much food that they can get fat off of it?*

I let out a sigh. Another reason showing that it was a bad idea to send those children to their doom. I just hoped that things will get better now that the Drezjin below the floor right now don't have to worry about war...

*Memory Transcription Subject: Bahumth, Kolshian vampire.*

""But isn't that like, *really* bad for you?"" Tevith asked me.

""Yes. I'm not *supposed* to drink blood, but I can't help myself at times!"" I replied.

Tevith scratched his head at my words. Glis and I had attempted to talk to Tanca's new friend to stave off the boredom, but one thing led to another, and here I was explaining my mental problems to the Arxur as Glis watched from the sidelines.

""So... Why do you do it if it's not good for you?"" Tevith asked.

""Do I look like I know?"" I answered.

""Maybe it's her fuel source!"" Glis said.

Tevith and I slowly turned to look at Glis, confused looks apparent in our features.

Glis flashed a quick shade of blue as our eyes landed on him. ""... Hey, I never claimed to be an *expert* in organics...""

Tevith and I shook our heads. ""Anyway, as I was saying, I have no clue why I do it. But I wish I *could* keep doing it... Don't get me wrong, I love coffee, but it's not the same as actual blood... I genuinely kinda miss it...""

Tevith scratched the end of his snout as his eyes rolled around in thought.

It was Glis who spoke up again. ""Have you ever thought about talking to our moms about it?"" He asked me.

I blinked several times. ""Why would I ask them about this?""

""Well, since you have predator disease, who better to talk to about these problems than, well, predators?"" He explained.

""Thats... Actually not a bad idea..."" I muttered, my tentacles fluttering around as I thought to myself.

I mean, would they understand me? Well, they've been kind and patient with me for this long, why wouldn't they try to help? I just hoped they would understand and try to help me.

Amazing coffee on demand only added to my habit. I've noticed recently my cups of coffee have becoming weaker and weaker, to the point where they are starting to taste like creamer and hot water. I've noticed the output resembles pretty much hot water only and it doesn't look like any coffee is coming into my cup.

Since the cups have been weaker I've tried; running the machine empty before use, removing as many parts and cleaning them as possible (ie; pod basket), using a syringe to shoot water up to the top portion to try and free any blockage into the needles, and I've even tried different types of KCup pods (including refillable, solid plastic and those with filters on the side).

Has anyone else been through this as well, or am I doing something wrong?
