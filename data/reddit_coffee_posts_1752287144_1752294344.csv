1lxrf8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lxrf8p/i_told_my_brother_i_am_struggling_to_like_his/,I told my brother I am struggling to like his girlfriend AITAH,"I (20f) am having trouble accepting my brothers (24M) girlfriend (22f) She grew up and lives in the same town as us so she‚Äôs not far just for context. We both live at home. Sorry that this is a very long post, I just need to explain in depth why I feel this way. 

I was excited about her at first, I liked the idea of having another girl around that‚Äôs close to my age. But I quickly noticed she was toxic. One of the first things that rubbed me the wrong way was before I had ever even spoken to her in depth my brother had got me a shirt that said ‚Äúim annoying‚Äù for my ‚Äújoke‚Äù birthday gift (a thing our family does before the real gift), and when he had told her about the shirt on the phone while he had her on speaker, she responded saying, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so perfect for her it fits her personality perfectly‚Äù as if we‚Äôre familiars, I felt that was rude. Then one of the first times she came over to our house she was telling my mom how she felt her kitchen should be arranged. She talked down to my brother in front of my parents, and they couldn‚Äôt believe how she was demanding things from him like a servant (which she has since stopped since he had a conversation with her about it). 

Another time she demanded that I watch our cats while my parents go out of town so that she can stay the week, but I already had plans AND my brother had promised my mom 3 weeks before she invited herself over that he would watch our cats, she called me a brat and curse words, when I offered half the week and changed my plans. Another thing anytime my brother is asked to feed the animals or help with anything when she‚Äôs here he acts like a complete jerk and she tells him we‚Äôre ‚Äúusing him‚Äù, for context my mom just bought him a 10,000 car after he crashed his, he doesn‚Äôt pay rent, and she asks for help with small around the house things. He says she was raised very spoiled and was never asked for anything so to her It‚Äôs unacceptable that he‚Äôs asked to do things by people that aren‚Äôt her. 

Another time I borrowed a couple cotton round flats from my brother that have salicylic acid on them because we both use the same one, he borrowed it from me countless times and I just thought it was something we share, but he ended up getting mad about it suddenly and told me to stop using it and I said okay and I didn‚Äôt use it again. Then a few days later I was looking for a soap that my best friend got custom-made for me in Colorado for my birthday that was in a box under my side of the sink, I found it in the shower used. I asked my brother and they had gone under my sink and opened/ used it, he said sorry but she overheard and yelled ‚Äúdon‚Äôt apologize to her she used your acne pads.‚Äù I felt like that was totally rude for her to jump into our conversation and team up against me. He later clarified to her that he had used mine before as well, and she said that it didn‚Äôt matter. 

My dad wakes up at 5 AM for work every day and she‚Äôll come over and sometimes overstay her welcome being here sometimes a week and be loud until 12 in the morning laughing on the top of her lungs. I also had to tell my brother to say something because she would leave her products/items scattered all over the counter to where I couldn‚Äôt even get ready for bed, she put her personal items on of my makeup container (my only item on the sink in the corner), and she apparently responded by calling me bossy. 

When she knows he‚Äôs with me hanging out she‚Äôll send him spicy messages or be inappropriate on the phone and it‚Äôs even worse that he somewhat makes it known by saying like ‚Äúoh she just sent me something that I can‚Äôt tell you and it‚Äôs so inappropriate‚Äù she literally only does that when he‚Äôs hanging out with me, she doesn‚Äôt do it when he‚Äôs with my mom or his friends. It grosses me outttttt. Why is that being made known to me?

She moved my mom‚Äôs stuff and took an entire large basket on our pantry rack for her coffee/ snacks and demands that no one is allowed to touch it. Meanwhile, my mom pays for all her groceries when she‚Äôs here. Another thing that is disrespectful to take space in someone‚Äôs home when you don‚Äôt live there, who does that? 

My brother invited her to my birthday without even asking me and I told him to uninvite her because it was just him and my cousin and I felt it was rude. He just invited her to my parents anniversary surprise party that I was throwing that I spent all the money for, without asking, knowing my mom isn‚Äôt super fond of her. He automatically invites her onto her trips without talking to anyone else in the family even when he‚Äôs not the one paying. I don‚Äôt even go if I know she‚Äôs going so I haven‚Äôt been on the past 2 family weekend trips.  Nobody else in my family will say anything because they feel extremely uncomfortable. The only time it was ever called out was on my birthday. 

They have been dating one year and she will often get angry if he says he wants to wait to get married by giving him the silent treatment. She‚Äôs pressuring him to marry her frequently. He had to get her a promise ring, and it still has not made her chill. This person constantly being around and me feeling like I can‚Äôt even enjoy time with my family anymore sucks, my home doesn‚Äôt feel like a safe space anymore. I feel very uncomfortable around her. I asked my brother to go on a little road trip a couple towns over for the day just us and he told me only if he can invite her. 

I openly told him I am struggling to like her and I‚Äôm not fond of being around her, it went badly obviously - sorry again for the long post AITAH",1,1752294043.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

My favorite brew so far has been with a 100 mL / 30 g 12 clicks in on a Timemore Chestnut C3 in the 6-Cup. I have an electric stovetop and I have tried everywhere from 45 min at level 1 to 4 min at level 7 to brew my coffee and I get on average about 52 mL output of coffee. Meaning nearly half my water is still in the Moka when I pour.  

My questions are:  
1. what yield would I expect from a 100 mL / 20 g from a 3-Cup Moka?   
2. should I expect a mouthfeel with more or less oils?

Part of me thinks the smaller pot will let me yield more of the 100 mL decreasing the strength of the coffee due to less grounds and more water. The other part of me thinks I am not fully extracting the oil from the original 30 g, and while the 3-Cup might yield are great percentage of fluid, it will bring the same ratio of oil with it, resulting in a equally enjoyable, larger volume, and cheaper cup of coffee.

1lxr6nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1lxr6nl/reese_dives_into_birth_trauma_and_asks_fans_to/,Reese dives into birth trauma and asks fans to remind her to drink water,"Reese Quibell does a stream from home before going to her Nashville meet-up for Relatable Reese. She says not everyone has arrived yet so she's going there later. Reese keeps making a joke that if she gets murdered by a Jester, a Scientologist or someone else, she will haunt all of her fans if they don't watch the documentary about it. ""I need validation even in the afterlife,"" she says.   
  
A fan wishes her a happy belated birthday and Reese claims that she forgot when her birthday was. She turned 41 three days ago and has been reminding her fans about when her birthday is in every stream for a month.   
  
Reese says she can't do any more digging about her past in Scientology on her own, so she's going down rabbit holes about it with friends, her therapist and her channel.   
  
She claims she's never had a deep connection or bond with anyone because she always thinks it's just a matter of time before everyone but her 95-year-old deceased husband Fred will leave her.   
  
Reese feels like she hasn't bonded in a normal way with her son. She was told she couldn't breast-feed H and she had to make L. Ron Hubbard's barley formula for him. Reese admitted in a stream with Natalie months ago that H's teeth were rotted from that formula. Before H was born, other Scientologists told Reese she had already been a mother many times before in previous lives.   
  
When H was about six months old, his grandfather started spending a lot of time with H. Doug would write her checks and she accepted them because H's father didn't make much money. Doug took H for every Christmas and Thanksgiving until Reese was kicked out of Scientology, so she never got to develop any traditions with H, she says.   
  
Every time Reese starts talking about this topic, I'm reminded that she has never taken H on a trip anywhere, not even for a weekend. She's taken many trips herself since leaving Scientology.

She says she didn't play much of a role for most of H's life and she claims that's common for many Scientology parents. Moose is standing by her Anthropologie chairs and looks like he might start scratching them. ""Don't do it, son,"" she tells him.   
  
Because she didn't even have a bond with H, she shouldn't have been expected to have any idea about how to be a friend, Reese says. Reese says she had H knowing that Scientology was eventually going to take him. She's realizing more and more how diabolical Scientology is, she says.   
  
Reese is very angry with LRH. A friend told Reese yesterday she thinks David Miscavige is more evil than LRH. Reese thinks LRH believed his own bullshit and Miscavige doesn't buy any of it.   
  
Reese says there are many things about her that are set in stone.   
  
Brenda, H's grandmother, was rarely around H because she spent so much time working at the Kansas City org, Reese says. H probably has very few memories of Brenda because Doug bonded with H and closed everyone else out, she says. Reese is angry with Doug because of how he treated her and H. She's angry with Brenda because Brenda was her friend. ""It's a separate thing,"" she says.   
  
Some chatters are concerned that H's Scientologist grandparents might try to contact him while he's visiting his father. Doug and Brenda have basically disconnected from their son Michael because of Reese, she says, adding that she feels horrible about that.   
  
She doesn't want H to be her everything. Reese says she wants to have her own life and she believes that H should have some independence. She has always been matter of fact with him, she says. She wasn't raised around any strong mothers so she had no role models for motherhood, she says.

Reese talks about Maggie, who was the executive director of the Kansas City org. Maggie hated her, she says. Maggie had a daughter Reese's age and she would bring Faye to Omaha to play with Reese. ""I really liked Faye and all of a sudden she was gone,"" Reese says. ""... She was put into the Sea Org at like 10."" Reese used to say she had no friends as a child and never had other kids to play with. Now she's talking about Faye.   
  
Faye came to Kansas City when Reese was in her 30s and Maggie finally saw her daughter again. That's how unimportant parent-child relationships are in Scientology, Reese says. Brenda went to a Scientology training program out of state for four years when Michael was 12 to 16 years old. ""Those are some serious years to just leave your kid. She felt nothing about it,"" Reese says. Michael wasn't in school during those years. He was left home alone, she says.

Reese and Brenda were arguing one day about Michael being John Lennon or being born as someone who's stuck in a drug incident from a past life. Reese was getting more angry that Brenda wasn't taking any accountability for leaving Michael when he was 12. Brenda was telling Reese they needed her to convince Michael to do the Purif again and that they'd already paid for it. ""He's fucked up because of you guys,"" Reese says she told Brenda.   
  
Suddenly Reese announces that she hasn't had any food or water all day and she asks if her viewers will mind if she goes to get a probiotic drink because she thinks her blood sugars are off. She insists she doesn't need to eat, but she comes back in with an Olipop soda and a piece of cheese.   
  
Reese says she's been noticing that she feels like she needs to catch her balance sometimes when she's streaming, and that's why she was concerned about her bloodwork earlier this week. She thought her A1C might have shot up, but it didn't. Reese admits that maybe she needs to be on a better eating schedule. Her chatters are asking her to check her blood sugar levels and eat something before livestreams.   
  
She says she forgets to drink water sometimes until 7 o'clock at night. Reese throws in that she's not drinking electrolytes anymore. Reese used to have quite a few electrolyte items on her Amazon wishlist, but after she brought Finn home she changed her wishlist to focus only on her pets and not herself and H. I'm guessing that some fans will send her the electrolytes she likes after this stream.   
  
Reese could easily keep some almonds and a bottle of water nearby anytime she's streaming, but she doesn't want to do that because she wants her fans to be worried about her. She says H gets mad at her for forgetting to drink water. ""I drink a cup of coffee every morning and that's it,"" she says, adding that sometimes she only drinks one glass of water a day.

Reese then asks someone who has her phone number to text her and remind her to drink water. A nurse sends Reese a superchat saying that dehydration is serious and she'll remind her to drink. Another superchatter tells her to drink water too. Hey Reese, you can set an alarm on your phone and do that yourself. Your learned helplessness is off the charts.   
  
Reese starts talking about her birth trauma with H. An auditor gave Reese a pregnancy assist right after she gave birth to H. She had gestational diabetes and she and H's blood sugar levels were not good. H weighed over 10 pounds. After the C-section, H was whisked away and Reese didn't see him again for three days. ""It destroyed me,"" Reese says, adding that she feels very guilty about it. He had to be in the neonatal intensive care unit because of his blood sugars. Reese had 19 staples from the C-section.   
  
""I was put into this really nice suite at the hospital,"" Reese says. Well, it's no wonder that Reese thinks Blue Cross Blue Shield is horrible health insurance then. Her parents and Michael's parents have so much money that they can give Reese anything she wants. Her viewers need to remember that before they send her money.   
  
She had a morphine drip and she was clicking it, Reese says. She couldn't get feeling back in her legs 24 hours after the birth so a neurologist had to come in, she says. She started to freak out but she got some feeling back in her legs two days later. Because of precautions about swine flu, H couldn't be brought to Reese, she says.   
  
Then Reese had to tell a lactation consultant she couldn't breast feed for religious reasons. Reese says she believed what she was told by LRH, but she has also said in a past stream that she did research about LRH's barley formula and decided on her own to use goat's milk instead of following LRH's formula. She claims she got in trouble for that too, so she could have just made the decision to breast feed.  
  
She tears up saying she's been told that breast-feeding is a really bonding thing to do with your child. Reese says she's sure some Scientology moms choose to breast-feed their babies, but it's extremely frowned upon.   
  
Reese says Michael and Doug kept trying to wake her up to do pregnancy assists, but she was too out of it from the morphine. By the second day, she was asking where H was, she says. A nurse who's a frequent superchatter spends $52 in this stream to send Reese seven superchats saying that Reese has birth trauma and that she'll talk that through with Reese if she wants. She tells Reese it would be good to talk to H about parenting before he becomes a dad. Reese tells that superchatter she knows the two of them need to catch up.   
  
Michael was coming and going from the NICU and telling Reese how beautiful H was. By the end of the third day, Reese could walk a little on her own, she says. The hospital brought a wheelchair in and said that she could go down and see H, but Reese was so upset by everything that had happened that she started crying and said she didn't want to see H, she says.   
  
Reese says she felt very bonded and close to H when he was in her belly. She was so depressed that he was whisked away from her that she told Michael she didn't want to see H or know what he looks like, she says. Reese says she felt like she didn't serve a purpose anymore for H. ""I was really out of my mind,"" she says. People in her chat feel terrible for Reese.   
  
Reese tears up and says she has never talked about this even in a therapy session. Those three days being separated from H felt like months to her, she says. She felt like H would have no idea who she was. ""I probably need to talk about this in therapy,"" she says. ""It's one of the things I avoid."" Reese is probably hoping that people will send her huge superchats for extra therapy appointments like some fans used to do last year. But then Reese just blew that money on shopping for stuff she doesn't need.  
  
She says she would never want to tell H about what happened in the few days around his birth. Reese, you just told the world. Poor H.   
  
Reese feels like those first few days affected her as a mother. ""I don't know that I ever fully bonded with him,"" she says. She could easily save a conversation like this for one of her Zoom calls or for a therapy session. I think she's talking about this today on purpose because she's going to be meeting a bunch of fans this weekend. Reese knows now that people will be very worried about her physically and emotionally. She'll get extra emotional and financial support from fans because of that.   
  
She says she loves H and she would never leave him, but she has always been very hands-off with him. H is her rock, she says. She praises him for being stable and steady. ""You know him,"" she tells her fans. But we have seen him panic on camera when a car pulls up outside. He's having some issues in school and struggling with his body image. Reese should be his rock. She should never expect him to be hers. And whenever more truth comes out about Reese, she's quick to remind her audience that they don't really know her or H.   
  
Reese wonders if H will look back 10 or 20 or 30 years from now and say that his mom was never really there for him. Reese says the feeling that she felt in the hospital those first three days has kind of carried with her and she feels really bad about that. She says she gets confused sometimes about whether her thoughts are her own ""or is this a Scientologist talking?""   
  
She says she never bonded with her own mom even though she loves her. Reese and her mom are close like friends, she says. Her dog Beau comes to comfort her because he can tell how upset she is. Reese won't have these conversations with her mom because she knows her mom has her own trauma, she says.

Reese says she has told H his whole life that there are age-appropriate things to talk about and that if anyone asks him a question he's uncomfortable with, he doesn't have to answer them. But we have seen Reese on multiple occasions push H on a livestream to answer strangers' questions and talk about things he's clearly not comfortable with. To read about one of the worst times she pushed H on camera, click this link.

She says she's always told H that it's OK to show emotions. She tells a story about him crying recently and telling her that he feels weak for doing that. She told him crying was strength. Reese shouldn't have told that story on camera. That's exploiting H's privacy too.   
  
A chatter says ""Hey Reese, I have found Helene and we are at our hotel, are we getting together this evening at all?"" Reese says she's coming to the hotel after everyone gets there.   
  
Reese says she's glad she never had more than one kid because she doesn't think she's built for motherhood and it's not her strong suit. H was never allowed to throw a fit in public, she says, and he still knows immediately when he's done something to make Reese mad. He's starting to be a little bit mouthy with her, she says. Reese was raised with cold parents, so she knew she wanted to do better with H, she says, adding that she has always told H that she loves him and is proud of him.   
  
She's too scared to talk to H about whether she hasn't been warm enough as a mother, she says. But she just had a conversation with H about that recently and he asked her if the haters were getting to her. Reese expects H to reassure her as a mother and not to ask her things that she doesn't want to talk about.   
  
Reese leaves to get the birthday card H wrote for her. ""Have fun with your people and I'll be thinking about you,"" he writes. ""I love you so much."" Then she holds his handwriting up to the camera to show how bad it is.   
  
She says she has lots of regrets about how she mothered H, especially letting Doug have so much control. ""He gave us money in exchange for it and I took it,"" she says. Reese says there's way more to the story about Doug that is dark and ugly. Someday she may get into that on her channel, she says.   
  
""Look at how special you have made our lives coming out of Scientology,"" she says, emphasizing to her fans that H loves them and asks about them. ""This is our real family. This is our real friends.""   
  
Reese says she thinks she and her channel need to hit more Scientology topics hard because it forces her to think about them more deeply. ""No one can deal with trauma all at once,"" she says.   
  
She ends the stream by waking her elderly dog up because one of her biggest fans wants to see Gertie. Reese says she'll be streaming from home and from her Nashville meet-up with fans this weekend.",2,1752293265.0,OT42,0,1.0,False

1lxr33c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1lxr33c/i_thought_i_was_finally_escaping/,I thought i was finally escaping‚Ä¶,"I (31M) what‚Äôs introduced to a girl (27F) in Korea. She was born and raised there, while I immigrate to US 20 years ago. We were introduced by a mutual acquaintance of our respective fathers.

At first things were going great, we tried to find this time of the day that worked for both of us to talk. We shared a lot of hobbies and interests, as well as sharing similar values in life and priorities. That last part was really winning me over. I‚Äôve sent her a few digital coupons for iced coffees and teas, which she loved.

But then her job had an organizational shift, and she essentially became the team lead, which made her insanely busy (without the added benefits or pay, but that‚Äôs beside the point). I tried to be as responsive as possible, but she usually took three or four days to respond.

Now her father was traveling all over the world and the last stop happened to be my area. My dad was compelled to take him out to a dinner, and the three of us had a nice meal and good conversation. He confirmed that her daughter was in fact very busy, so at least I know she wasn‚Äôt lying to me to be nice. Her father seems to have taken a like to me. However, his vacation was cut short due to a sudden illness, and he flew back to Korea.

I tried talking to her again and not only is she still respond, but  her responses have become a lot more cut and dry.

I just feel that she‚Äôs going through a lot right now. And I feel I would be the biggest douche if I pursue anything further with her.

I was planning a vacation to Korea in October, but now I‚Äôm not so sure if she‚Äôll even have time to meet with me if I do. I can definitely tell that the initial excitement is gone from both of us, never mind the time zone difference. I feel with so many things getting in between our way, I should just end things here. Someone actually advised me to do this, as in a what-if scenario where we get married, she will have to move overseas with me and it‚Äôs gonna be miserable for her; vice versa, if I moved over back to Korea.

And that brings me to the title; I genuinely thought that I was gonna escaping being FA, and finally breaking the cycle.

1lxqyke,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lxqyke/upgrade_from_bambino_plus_profitec_move_2200/,"Upgrade from Bambino Plus -> Profitec MOVE [$2,200 budget]","Hey everyone,

I'm deep down the rabbit hole researching my next espresso machine and I'm heavily leaning towards the Profitec MOVE. I've watched YouTube and went through posts on Reddit, but since it's a newer model, detailed long-term reviews are a bit limited.

Currently, I'm using a Bambino Plus paired with a Niche Zero grinder. My daily routine involves one latte and one Americano on weekdays. On weekends, I'll make 2 lattes back-to-back, and occasionally, when friends or family visit, I'll be pulling 2-4 lattes or americanos consecutively.

I don't feel the Profitec Go would be a significant enough upgrade from my Bambino Plus, and I'm really looking for a machine that will reliably serve me for over seven years. My budget is around $2,000 to $2,200.

I've ruled out the Ascaso Steel Duo due to the plug situation ‚Äì I'm not keen on buying a US market machine that requires a separate converter.

I really like the style and compact size of the Profitec MOVE.

Here are the potential cons I've noted:

Steam Power: I've seen some reviews mention weak steam, though apparently, this can be resolved by switching to a 4-hole tip. As long as it's better than the Bambino Plus, I'll be happy.

Heat-up Time: At around 12 minutes, it's considerably longer than the Bambino Plus. This isn't a huge deal for my morning routine, as I'm usually busy with other tasks like unloading the dishwasher and packing for the kids before making coffee.

Pre-order: I'm fine with waiting, as my Bambino Plus is still fully functional.

Beyond the steam power and heat-up time, are there any other flaws or significant cons of the Profitec MOVE that I should be aware of before placing an order?

Ultimately, my main reason for upgrading is my enjoyment of making lattes, Americanos, and practicing latte art.

I'm also very curious: will the taste difference between shots from a Bambino Plus and the MOVE be genuinely noticeable?

Any insights from current Profitec MOVE owners or those with experience upgrading from a Bambino Plus would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",1,1752292533.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

***Wednesday***

As soon as Tucker returned to his desk, he pulled out his personal phone and dialled his CHRO, Isabella Hurst.

‚ÄúHey, is something wrong with your landline?‚Äù Bella asked, her warmth slightly countered by a hint of concern. ‚ÄúAnd if so, why are you calling me and not Colton?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of Colton. I‚Äôm not sure how much access he has to anything on the company system anymore, and I‚Äôm not taking chances.‚Äù

Bella paused long enough for Tucker to know she was working out exactly what that meant. It wasn‚Äôt like her to be skittish‚Äîshe‚Äôd seen worse in her time‚Äîbut Colton‚Äôs shadow loomed large in this company. ‚ÄúOooo-kay,‚Äù she finally said, ending the word on an uptick that told him she still didn‚Äôt get it. He wasn‚Äôt surprised.¬†

‚ÄúI need his daughter Max‚Äôs number. If I pull it from here, he‚Äôll spot it. He won‚Äôt question you going through personnel records.‚Äù

‚ÄúGiven that it‚Äôs literally my job to be on top of our personnel, I should hope not. Okay, hold on.‚Äù He could hear her fingers tapping on her keyboard. ‚ÄúOut of curiosity, what do you need to reach Maxine for?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just sent Colton home.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I was this close to dosing his next coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúI made the mistake of saying good morning to him this morning, and let‚Äôs just say it went downhill from there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd that wasn‚Äôt your first clue that he was a liability today? You‚Äôre HR for god‚Äôs sake.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm HR. Not his mother. Until he did something actionable, my hands were tied, and if being a bear with a sore head was grounds for me to step in, half this building would be empty.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve still told me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith all due respect, Tucker, you‚Äôve kinda had your plate full this week, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

He couldn‚Äôt argue with that. If Colton‚Äôs situation had come to his attention earlier this week, he wouldn‚Äôt have been anywhere near capable of dealing with it. ‚ÄúWell, anyway ‚Äì just text me the number to this phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got it, boss.‚Äù

\* \* \*

Maxine Shaw sat behind her usual array of monitors and keyboards. The left-hand screen displayed current camera feeds on the right side, accompanied by a live map of each team member‚Äôs location on the left. The screen in front of her had an almost identical layout‚Äîexcept it displayed footage from several hours earlier; specifically, when Two-Three and that assassin-turned-cop-turned-consultant dropped off their network.

No, that wasn‚Äôt right ‚Ä¶ and that was the problem.

It would be so much easier if Two-Three‚Äôs feed had simply dropped out due to some type of epic failure on his locator‚Äôs part.

Instead, the damn thing pinged all the way over in Boston. *Boston!* What the ever-loving fuck? Their system was supposed to be hackproof! Between the triple-redundant firewalls, the live audits every month, and the independent external scrubs every quarter, nothing should have gotten in.

Hell, her dad even employed a team of international white hat hackers to *try* and break the system, with a ridiculous bonus should they ever succeed, and they never had. But now, everything her dad and his friends had built was crumbling with every impossible ping from Boston.

And she was at a loss ‚Äî not just for how they did it, but why they‚Äôd go to such lengths for something so petty. Hacking and breaking a communications array to hide the exact location of a BoO that one of their operatives was already at made no sense.

Sure, he‚Äôd come back in one piece, and she‚Äôd kept him away from the windows so he couldn‚Äôt see where he‚Äôd been‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt like he‚Äôd hopped a car or plane. He walked into a building!!

She glared at the camera feed from the alleyway where Two-Three and the Cobrati assassin had turned into the garage like she was missing something important. *We know where you were! So what was the point?*

¬†Was it to show them that she could? *That‚Äôs not scary at all,* she thought, rolling her eyes. Thankfully, when Two-Three returned, he reported they were all on the same page and that the Nascerdios had sent her in just to keep an eye on things. He seemed convinced she wasn‚Äôt in the family business and took her job for law enforcement seriously.

Of course, he wouldn‚Äôt be the first guy to think with his dick, but she didn‚Äôt get that vibe from him. He was too much of a straight shooter. The kind who would put an animal down if he had to and mourn the loss later in private.

She slowed the footage down to hundredths of a second, right before Two-Three‚Äôs locator vanished from LA, and spotted a tiny window where he didn‚Äôt appear in LA or Boston. ‚ÄúTalk about a ‚Äòbeam me up, Scotty‚Äô hack,‚Äù she muttered. No way he was actually over there‚Äîbut damned if she could think of a better explanation.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù Echo One demanded, crossing the room to look over her shoulder.

Max sat back in her chair, knowing better than to hide anything from the team commander. ‚ÄúNothing, sir. Just frustrated to hell and back by how the Cobrati managed to infiltrate our system and use it against us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if they didn‚Äôt hack the whole system? What if they only hacked his tracker?‚Äù

‚ÄúStill a problem for us, sir. We either figure out how they did it, or we‚Äôre legally required to report the breach to the military.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds like a HQ problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds like a *‚Äòmy dad‚Äô* problem‚Äîand I‚Äôm not letting him hang out to dry after everything he‚Äôs done for us.‚Äù

Max‚Äôs phone lit up on the table. A long time ago, she‚Äôd disabled the vibration after an abandoned coffee cup had danced its way past the balance point above her keyboard. Newsflash: Coffee dregs and keyboards were not compatible. ¬†

She picked up the phone, her eyes going wide at the Caller ID. Echo One saw it too. ‚ÄúBig, Big Boss?‚Äù He arched an eyebrow.

Max held up one finger, then took a calming breath before swiping to accept the call. ‚ÄúMister Portsmith,‚Äù she said, giving Echo One a *‚Äòyeah,* that *big, big boss‚Äô* look.

‚ÄúMaxine,‚Äù the man whose voice she recognised from the various times he‚Äôd visited her father while she was growing up. They hadn‚Äôt spoken since she moved out west, so this was ‚Ä¶ disconcerting. ‚ÄúI need a favour from you.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom me?‚Äù she squeaked, then cleared her throat. ‚ÄúOf course, Mister Portsmith. What can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is both personal and professional. I need you and your team to avoid contacting your father for the next twenty-four hours. If it‚Äôs critical, put it through to his department. If it‚Äôs personal, it comes through me. He‚Äôs to be left alone until tomorrow. Do you understand?‚Äù

Maxine stared at the computer screens in front of her. God, she would‚Äôve loved to get her father‚Äôs take on this‚Äîbut Mister Portsmith had spoken. ‚ÄúUnderstood, sir. May I ask why?‚Äù That might‚Äôve been bold, but this was her father, and Mister Portsmith had been one of his old frat buddies. She was banking on that.

‚ÄúYour father spent all night helping you, and all day running his department. Even in his twenties, that would‚Äôve been a problem, and he‚Äôs decades past that. I‚Äôve sent him home, where hopefully he‚Äôll be going to bed.‚Äù

Maxine barely bit back the curse that shot through her. She should‚Äôve seen how thin he was stretching himself‚Äîand as usual, he had to be the hero of the hour. ¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôll do you one better, sir,‚Äù she said, already pulling up her favourites. ‚ÄúAs soon as this call‚Äôs over, I‚Äôll sic Mom onto him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI appreciate that. Good luck.‚Äù And with that, Tucker was gone.

Seconds later, she was on a very different call. ‚ÄúHey, Mom. Is Dad home yet?‚Äù

\* \* \*

Colton hadn‚Äôt planned on falling asleep in the back of his town car, but he awoke to someone shaking his shoulder, and it took him far too long to recognise his wife‚Äôs grip. He came awake with a startled snort, blinking at his surroundings, his brain sluggishly trying to make sense of what he‚Äôd missed.

Naomi was leaning into the car, her hand still gripping his shoulder. Her expression was as tight as her hold‚Äînever a good combination.

George lingered by the back window. He knew not to get between the couple, but Naomi wouldn‚Äôt be strong enough to hold Colton inside the house if he stumbled.

‚ÄúCome on. *Out,‚Äù* she said, half-dragging his shoulder forward like he‚Äôd morphed back into one of their kids from twenty years ago.

He had the wherewithal to unbuckle his seatbelt and slide to the edge of the seat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù he said to George, who nodded and took a half step back ‚Ä¶ clearly not believing him.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon. Let‚Äôs get you upstairs and out of those clothes. You might want to take off the tie first‚Äîbecause right now, the temptation to tighten it instead of loosen it might be too strong for me to ignore.‚Äù

George snorted, though the asshole hid it behind a cough.

‚ÄúHoney‚Ä¶‚Äù He‚Äôd been going for placation, but even he heard the whine in his voice.

She slid in under his arm as he used the door to haul himself upright. ‚ÄúNope. Not doing this right now. Later‚Äîafter you‚Äôve had some sleep‚Äîwe‚Äôll talk about how ‚Äòfine‚Äô you were this morning, coming downstairs in mismatched shoes.‚Äù

He put one foot in front of the other as she spoke, but was still glad to reach the front door. ‚ÄúTucker called you, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù he asked, as he reached for the door handle.¬†

She lightly smacked his hand aside and opened it for him, keeping her shoulder tucked under his ribs. ‚ÄúNo, he did not. Now, no more questions.‚Äù Once inside, she parked him against the hallway wall and went back to the front door. ‚ÄúThanks again for bringing him home, George. Say hello to your mother for me.‚Äù

Although he couldn‚Äôt see George‚Äôs face, Colton could almost hear the effort it took for the driver to keep his reaction professional. George and his mother had‚Ä¶ *disagreed* over how to handle his little brother‚Äôs alcoholism, and the two were now barely speaking.

It wasn‚Äôt something either of them had told Naomi ‚Äî and clearly, neither had George‚Äôs mother. Colton would have, but George had asked him to respect his privacy‚Äîand Colton could well understand it. His mother wasn‚Äôt exactly shy about making a scene when it suited her, and he needed his job to pay for his brother‚Äôs rehab.

‚ÄúWill do, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

The door shut, and moments later, Colton felt his left arm lift, and Naomi slid underneath him once more. ‚ÄúCome on, hero. Bedtime.‚Äù

*Hero.*

The moment she said it, Colton closed his eyes with a curse, knowing exactly who had reached out to her. *Dammit, Maxine.*

Hello Hashimoto‚Äôs Community!
First, I just want to say I‚Äôve been reading so many of your posts and learning a lot. I relate deeply to the frustration, confusion, and trial-and-error so many of you describe. This condition affects more than just the thyroid, it can disrupt your nervous system, your sleep, your energy, and your sense of self.

Like many of you, I‚Äôve dealt with dismissive doctors who tell me my labs are ‚Äúfine‚Äù even when I‚Äôm struggling to walk across the room without crashing. Friends and family often don‚Äôt understand either. They think it‚Äôs just about being tired or moody. It‚Äôs isolating, especially when your symptoms don‚Äôt match what others expect. That‚Äôs why this community is such a blessing.

Anyway, I wanted to share what‚Äôs helped me come back from a pretty intense flare. My nervous system is highly sensitive (what some would call a ‚Äúhighly attuned nervous system‚Äù), and it‚Äôs taken a lot of trial and error to find a rhythm that works. I hope something here helps you feel seen or gives you a new idea to try.

Core Meds & Supplements (with what they helped most)

Levothyroxine (88mcg daily)
‚ÄÉCore thyroid support. Took about 2 weeks to feel improvements after advocating an increase from 75mcg.

Slow-release Iron (daily)
‚ÄÉReduced fatigue and dizziness, especially around my cycle.

Zinc (50mg every other day)
‚ÄÉImmune regulation + mental clarity. Important for thyroid health.

Copper (2mg opposite days of zinc)
‚ÄÉMaintains mineral balance (too much zinc lowers copper).

Selenium (200mcg every other day)
‚ÄÉCalmed thyroid inflammation. Reduced flares.

Vitamin B12 (daily with breakfast juice)
‚ÄÉBig shift in nerve pain, low mood, and ‚Äúwiped out‚Äù feeling.

Vitamin D3 (with coffee, 1 hr after Levo-T)
‚ÄÉSupported mood and energy, esp. in low-sunlight months.

NAC (600mg daily)
‚ÄÉHelped with brain fog, immune buffering, and overall inflammation.

Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)
‚ÄÉGame-changer. Stabilized energy, reduced sensory sensitivity (especially to noise/bass), improved resilience to stress.

Electrolytes (daily, mixed in water)
‚ÄÉReduced muscle burn and post-nap fatigue. Huge for adrenal recovery.

Food 
	‚Ä¢	Breakfast ‚Äì Oatmeal, soft-boiled egg with salt, juice with added B12
	‚Ä¢	Lunch ‚Äì Protein (chicken, chicken sausage, etc.) + zucchini or spinach
	‚Ä¢	Dinner ‚Äì Salmon, potatoes (with turmeric), asparagus or steamed artichoke
	‚Ä¢	Snacks ‚Äì Kefir smoothies with berries, honey, turmeric, ginger, spinach for digestion 
	‚Ä¢	Treats ‚Äì Tea biscuits, honey in tea or coffee. One cup of coffee daily with half and half (one hour after meds).

Moderate carbs + gentle fats worked best.
Avoided gluten, soda, processed sweets, and takeout.
Used seasonings like turmeric, thyme, and paprika helped a lot with inflammation.

Nervous System Support (Sensory + Sleep)

Magnesium L-Threonate (evening)
‚ÄÉCalms overstimulation. Improved sleep latency and depth.

Noise-canceling headphones + brown noise
‚ÄÉBlocks low-frequency bass from outside. Essential during flares.

Foam earplugs (limited use)
‚ÄÉHelps during fireworks or construction, when tolerable.

Fans, Brown noise (low panning) blackout curtains, predictable bedtime
‚ÄÉKeeps sleep rhythm consistent.


What Finally Shifted After 3‚Äì4 Weeks of Consistency
	‚Ä¢	Moved around house without muscle burn or labored breathing!!
	‚Ä¢	Tolerated vibration/bass better than I have in months
	‚Ä¢	Improved sleep (5‚Äì6 uninterrupted hours)
	‚Ä¢	Less sensory overwhelm
	‚Ä¢	More emotional steadiness and feeling less reactive, more grounded
	‚Ä¢	Returned to cooking, light chores, even a walk to the store without collapse which was huge!

I also stopped treating naps as failure. They‚Äôre repair time, not weakness.

If you‚Äôre in the thick of a flare, I hope this helps you feel less alone. Let me know what‚Äôs worked for you or if you‚Äôre trying to find your footing again. Wishing you all much improvement and peace. ",6,1752291004.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False

I'm wondering if I should explain the fact that I suspect I have P.O.T.S. at my job interview tomorrow. I'll be working at a coffee shop, so there'll be less standing still than my last job, but I'll still spend lots of time on my feet. I don't know if I can ask for accommodations in my current situation, but I'd like to sit down sometimes when possible and know that I can stop to eat/drink salt or electrolytes when I need it. 

At my last job, I had to ask for ""accommodations"" after they established a 'no water bottle at your check stand' policy for cashiers. We were meant to just pop into the break room when it was slow and take a sip if we were thirsty, but I couldn't work like that. It was overly warm inside and I needed a steady intake to stay vertical. I struggled with near-syncope, lightheadedness, fatigue and a racing heartbeat working there, even when I had my water, but I also had to have a really awkward conversation about the fact that I had no idea what was causing those issues. It seemed to me they didn't like the fact that I didn't disclose those issues before I got hired or that I was asking for special treatment without a reason or diagnosis to back it up. 

I want to avoid another encounter like this going forward. I'm prepared to work without formal (or really, informal) accommodations again, I just want to take the best course of action possible. ",13,1752290975.0,disability,6,0.93,False

Also my teeth enamel is sensitive to erosion, and stains easily, and the more I use abrasive whitening treatments the more my only set of teeth becomes more transparent at such a young age (my dentists says it is normal but it really bothers me and I wish I had fully calcified teeth..). I do always drink through a straw but still. I have a lot of reasons to cut out coffee.

Recently I have changed to decaf (still can stain, through a straw) and I am feeling a bit better. Trying my best prioritise my sleep but thats a long process because I feel most myself during the peace of the night especially when I'm stressed.

What I miss the most is the morning ritual of coffee üò≠ Maybe I should replace it with something like some yummy iced teas, like ginger or citron honey or morrocan tea (its sweetened green tea though) seems interesting. Matcha I lose my appetite for a lot.

Hey there redditors,
 My name's Lindsey,  I'm turning 31.. ü§¢ here soon.

It's been a lackluster summer so far, but hopefully it improves this month.

I hope your summer is going well or maybe your like me and its nice to talk to somebody that's outside of your day to day grind or whatever your going through.

I'm basically going through a rough patch again in life but I'll bounce back as always 

I'm looking for what I mentioned above. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Maybe we just need a friendly chat , who try to understand and listen making connections where you wouldn't think of one to occur.

A few things about me.

*I love music production and anything to do with it 
/( Yes I know everyone but music as a bullet point in interests.

But it's worthwhile to mention I do like to play and learn guitar.
Etc. etc . Lol

* I absolutely Love reading and watching Horror movies.. I gravitate towards slashers and psychological thriller. Suspense is just oxygen to me lol.

Books yes . Dogs or cats ?  Dogs here 

Cooking .. hell yes ü§§ 
I don't play much games nowadays. I love black coffee/ Americano
I do like racing games and some fighting games. Mostly fallout and Mortal Kombat Mobile.
Mental health advocate/ empathetic 
Physical fitness .  So so

I'm not doing much for a few days so I'm game to spark up a friendship & chat.

PS thanks for reading and hope you enjoy your week!  (: ",1,1752290848.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

It wasn‚Äôt that long ago‚Äîless than 3 years back.

I‚Äôm 33 now. I was 30 then, and he was 25.
Because of how I was raised, dating wasn‚Äôt really an option earlier‚Äînot unless I wanted drama. My mum‚Äôs nosy, my dad‚Äôs overprotective, and I watched what my siblings went through. So I waited. Then I left my country for a one-year postgrad course abroad‚Äîand for the first time, I had the freedom to try.

I joined the apps. I was nervous, overthinking  everything‚Äîwho I‚Äôd meet, what would happen, how fast things might go. It wasn‚Äôt hard to get matches, but very few asked me out‚Ä¶ until he did.

He was a young lawyer, Ivy League-educated, soft-spoken but smart, artsy, grounded. He felt familiar. When we messaged, it was easy. When he asked me out, I immediately said yes. 

We hugged at first sight. Walked together to a caf√© and ended up talking for over two hours, even though we both had plans after. He walked on the roadside, opened doors, picked a quiet table. We kept ordering more coffee just to stay a little longer.

He asked about what I studied, what I cared about. I told him I write, I draw. He didn‚Äôt find it strange or intense (even my family knows that‚Äôs how I am)‚Äîhe just listened and shared back. I‚Äôve got lawyers in the family, so I could follow his world too. There was a sense of‚Ä¶ ease. Familiarity. Or something idk. He felt like someone I‚Äôd made up when I was younger and finally stumbled across by accident.

We dated for about a month as things moved suddenly but gently. He knew it was my first time, and he didn‚Äôt push. But we got intimate after the 2nd. That first month, I came over to his family home when no one else was around. I think he liked having me there‚Äîmaybe he liked the quiet rebellion of it, or maybe he just liked me.

*This is the moment I remember the most.*
We were curled up on his family‚Äôs new leather sofa, half-watching a movie, arms wrapped around each other. My head was on his chest, his head resting on mine. Then he shifted‚Äîlifted his head, looked at me for a few seconds, smiled. He kissed my forehead, pulled me in tighter. I smiled back. I remember everything: the feel of his jumper, the sound of his breath, his heartbeat, the scent of his hair and skin, the way he looked in the low light. That memory still undoes me. It always makes me cry.

Then something changed. I‚Äôd told him I‚Äôd talked about him online‚Äînot in detail, not by name, but enough to make him uncomfortable. He pulled back. Said he needed space and I respected that. But I didn‚Äôt see anyone else‚Äîjust buried myself in school.

Summer came. He reached out. Said he missed me. So we met up again. Things felt normal, even warm. I cooked for him. He tried my food. Asked about my culture. It felt like we were heading somewhere.

Then he changed his mind. Said our age and culture gap were too big. That he couldn‚Äôt see a future. Said maybe we could just be FWBs instead.

He didn‚Äôt ghost me. I‚Äôll give him that. But I wish he‚Äôd told me that it wasn‚Äôt going to go anywhere sooner. It would‚Äôve been easier to decide how much to give. Instead, he waited three months, and I was already in too deep.

Still, I said yes. I told myself I wanted to explore, and maybe I actually did. But he got busy with work, and I got tired of waiting around. One day, I told him I had feelings for him. He seemed surprised‚Äîlike it never occurred to him. That hurt most of all.

If he had just told me earlier‚Äîif he hadn‚Äôt let me believe we were building something real‚Äîmaybe I wouldn‚Äôt have been so hurt. Maybe I‚Äôd still have felt something, but not like that. Not as deeply.

So I ended it. I told him I was in love with him. That I saw him for who he really was‚Äîmessed up family, pain, all of it‚Äîand I didn‚Äôt judge him. I just accepted him. He told me I could find other guys just like him on the street. I didn‚Äôt have the words then‚ÄîI was choking on tears.

We stayed in touch for a while. I even wrote him a birthday letter. Told him he was still the one. That he mattered‚Äîeven if the world was full of versions of him, he was the one who left a mark. He said the letter was ‚Äúnice‚Äù and once again, said men like him weren‚Äôt rare.

Dating after him was a mess.
‚Äì One tried to get me drunk to scam me.
‚Äì One hadn‚Äôt moved on from his ex.
‚Äì One just used me for sex and ghosted (even refused to call it that lol).
‚Äì One was too tired to hook up and blamed me for not initiating.
‚Äì One heard me rant about everything at Xmas, then still pushed for sex.
‚Äì The last one became my boyfriend.

He seemed kind, open, warm. Not the typical white-collar guy, but educated. I introduced him to my family. They liked him. Marriage was mentioned. We dated long distance for the most part because I returned home and we were together for about 1.5 years. But he lied to me‚ÄîDM‚Äôd a girl for a hookup while I was with him that same Xmas. I broke things off soon after. Honestly, I think I had already emotionally clocked out by then. It helped he didn‚Äôt try too hard to make amends, I guess‚Ä¶

Every guy after my first ex hurt me somehow. But him? At least he told me the truth. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt kind, maybe it came too little too late‚Äîbut it was still honesty. And weirdly, that meant something to me.

Since then, I‚Äôve graduated, landed a good job. My siblings outed my dating life to my parents thinking it would cause chaos, but it didn‚Äôt‚Äîit actually brought us closer. And yet‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just scared to trust anyone again.

If I hadn‚Äôt met him, maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have walked into all the pain that followed. Maybe the good that‚Äôs happened since doesn‚Äôt quite make up for what I lost. Idk sometimes I just wish I had a guy friend I used to know and dated him instead. The apps may have poisoned the well long before I joined but it‚Äôs made everyone and everything feel jaded now.

And I‚Äôm tired.
Tired of wishing it didn‚Äôt happen.
Tired of remembering the good bits.
Tired of wondering if I‚Äôll ever find anything like it again.
Tired of crying over it‚Äîeven after a good day, even after feeling strong.
Tired of wanting connection in a world that makes it feel like a joke.

Sometimes I just wish God would end the pain. Quiet the noise.

But until then, I‚Äôm here. Still remembering. Still missing him.
And knowing‚Äîwho I was with him, I‚Äôll never be again.
And whoever comes next‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll always be measured against a memory.",1,1752290287.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Two brands. One dreamed up by two locals who shared a passion for beer and history, the other a brain child of a millionaire wine maker from the heart of Napa Valley. One brand embraces the martime and working class history of its region and the other wanted to shed it. Only one could prevail. The name Savage and Cooke never really ment anything. If the curious patron inquired about its origins, they were told about the allure of its vissonary creator. If pressed further they might have been told they were names found on secret documents during the buildings renovation. Depending on the day of ones visit, they were brothers who worked on Mare Island. It's never really made clear when asked, but the genius and adroitness of its owner were reiterated. A man with a boutique coffee roaster, a winery, and a fried chicken restaurant on his vision board. Was the uncertainness of the future of the wine industry his downfall? Or maybe the delivery of historic ships to Mare Island Brewery clogged up the vision of his waterfront. In the end Savage and Cooke prepaired fried chicken in a makeshift trailer 4 days a week, while Mare Island Brewery grew it's two locations and added a third.

27 Y F
My surgery is in exactly a month so today is literally my last day to vape. My doctor said I have to stop 30 days before. I just threw my vape out and I‚Äôm freaking out.

I smoked occasionally for 10 years but only got truly addicted about 3 years ago. It‚Äôs not just a little habit. It‚Äôs how I function. Coffee and vaping together are my favorite part of the day and honestly the only thing that makes me feel good. It‚Äôs also the only way I can really focus and work and make money.

I‚Äôm so scared that without it I won‚Äôt be able to work, won‚Äôt get anything done, won‚Äôt even feel like myself. I have severe ADHD and nicotine feels like the only thing that helps me function.

Also really afraid I‚Äôll gain weight. I‚Äôm health conscious otherwise‚Äîthis is literally my one vice. I know vaping is bad for me but it‚Äôs felt like my security blanket.

I‚Äôm also scared I won‚Äôt even be able to drink socially without it anymore, since I always vape when I drink.

Not sure how else to say it, but I really need support now. Please only kind words‚ÄîI‚Äôm genuinely scared and don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do this.

Has anyone actually gotten off it and felt normal again? How did you work? How did you handle coffee without it? How do you not just go insane? Will I ever be able to drink socially again without it?

Frozen dew layered across bright, warm fallen leaves. A reminder of the season. The best season, not just for Halloween, but my birthday. My aunts and uncles found it weird that I was born so close to the ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Holiday‚Äù, but it never bothered me.¬†¬†

After all, I wasn‚Äôt the curse. My Dad was.¬†

‚ÄúHey, Truman. Can you come down here?‚Äù A shock of fear snapped me awake. What did he need me to do now? How will I screw it up this time?¬†

‚ÄúTruman, get your ass down here!‚Äù I jump out of bed and run down the stairs in my pajamas, to see my dad with his stained ‚ÄúSnap-on‚Äù shirt, pouring another cup of coffee. 	What were you doing?‚Äù He asked.¬†¬†

‚ÄúSleeping in.‚Äù I responded.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWell, when I call for you, can please just, not wait?‚Äù He says, as he pours Jim Beam in his cup of coffee. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty selfish.‚Äù He remarks, a dryness in his voice drowned out by the poison infused java.¬†¬†

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù I responded. What else am I supposed to say? I was only 12. He towered over me. I couldn‚Äôt fight back, even if I tried.¬† Maybe being born into this family is the curse.¬†

‚ÄúOk, I need help holding the light. Trying to replace the oil pump, but I can‚Äôt see shit.‚Äù He demands. I oblige and head into the garage. The concrete floor was cold, but it didn‚Äôt sting as bad as the broken beer bottle I next stepped on. Dad saw me jump and wince at the pain. He jumped too.¬†

‚ÄúThe fuck?‚Äù He sharply remarked, until he looked down at the remains of the bottle, and the small drip of blood from my foot.¬†¬†

‚ÄúOh. Watch your step.‚Äù He spoke. ‚ÄúSorry, I gotta clean this place.‚Äù¬†¬†

He said sorry? Thats a first.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI'll grab a band-aid really quick.‚Äù I remarked, until he quickly answered.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNah, you‚Äôll be fine. It‚Äôll be super quick, I promise.‚Äù¬†¬†

I quickly reach for some flip-flops by the door, and hurry over to the car. A 1984 Pontiac Fiero. What a piece of shit. Damn thing had no power, and an interior akin to a plastic Cronenberg film. Risking either an infection from the cut, or the wrath of my dad, I picked helping him. I didn‚Äôt need him ruining my day because I tried to put myself over him.¬†

‚ÄúI got this new oil pan for this thing. Supposed to fix the fire risk these things were known for. The oil pan was too small on the original models, so when the things would overheat, some of that oil would seep out, hitting the exhaust manifold, causing the thing to ignite.‚Äù He droned. I‚Äôve always been into cars, but I hated working with him. If it meant less time around him, the better.¬†¬†

‚ÄúSo, I need you to help with getting this thing out. I don‚Äôt have much time before I gotta head to work, so I need you to hand me the right bolts while I'm down here, ok?‚Äù He asked.¬†

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù I responded, nonchalantly.¬† He flashed me a sour look. ‚ÄúCould you at least try and be a little interested? Christ.‚Äù He snapped. I walked over to the Snap-on drawer as he lowered himself under the jacked-up car. ‚ÄúSecond from the top.‚Äù I opened it to a set of random wires and a tiny bottle of Jim Beam. Tried the one below it, and low and behold, the socket wrenches. Bastard can‚Äôt even remember his own tools.¬†

‚ÄúOk, hand me a socket extension, and...uhh...let's try a 10mm.‚Äù He asked. I looked and could only find a 9mm and a 12mm.¬†¬†

‚ÄúUhh...there isn't a 10mm.‚Äù I said, shakily.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThe fuck do you mean?‚Äù He snapped.¬†

‚ÄúI only see a 9mm and a 11mm. No 10mm.‚Äù I responded. I could feel an ice-cold panic set in, just like whenever I helped him. It starts in the fingers, and quickly runs up your arms, until you‚Äôre shaking. It feels like having frostbite on a hot summer day.¬†

Dad sighs, fire in his breath. ‚ÄúJust give me the 11mm.‚Äù I grab the socket with the extender and click the 11mm onto it. My quivering hands lower to reach him. We lock eye contact.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou cold?‚Äù he asked, an ever-slight concern in his voice. I didn‚Äôt respond as I put the wrench into his hands.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou know, we could enjoy this if you weren't so scared all the damn time.‚Äù He responded.¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt care.¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt want to be with him. I didn't want him here at all. Not in this garage, this house, this street, this city, anywhere. I just want this bullshit done so he can go to work and leave me alone.¬†¬†

Please, God. Just let him leave me alone.¬†¬†

He grabbed the wrench from my hands, pulling it deep under the recesses of rust and wires. His arms were visible, as he motioned under the oil pan, connecting the extender to the oil pan‚Äôs bolt. He started turning the wrench, only to frustratedly whip the wrench out from under the car, smacking my bare toe. The sharp pain makes me flinch and gasp in pain.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou wouldn't have gotten hurt if you put on fuckin shoes. Now, give me the 10mm.‚Äù He snarled.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIt-it-it's not there.‚Äù I responded, using all my strength to hold back tears.¬†¬†

He let out a breath of fire and brimstone as he pulls himself out from under the car, gets to his feet as his drunken mass towers over me and comes closer.¬†¬†

It all happened so fast I couldn‚Äôt even register it. A hairy arm whips forward, pushing me so hard i fell off my feet, landing right onto the workbench behind me, spilling his coffee and a toolbox. I fall to the floor; a hot cup of coffee smashed into the cold concrete floor, as polished chrome rods crash into my chest with a hundred thuds, followed by a big red box. He rips open the second drawer, small plastic bottle of alcohol flies out with some wires, as he pulls a small 10mm socket, buried deep within the drawer.¬†¬†

He snaps a look back at me. I didn't have any strength left in me.¬†¬†

So, I cried. It‚Äôs all I could do.¬†

Suddenly, the door to the house opens, and it‚Äôs a sight I've wanted to see all morning.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat was that noise?‚Äù My mom shouted. ¬†

She walks over, seeing me on the cold hard floor in a puddle of tears. My foot‚Äôs covered in blood, with a red-cracked baby toe on top. A cacophony of Snap-On tools litter me, with a heavy red box smacking me right in my neck. My head in a pool of boozed-up coffee and tears. She gasps like her souls being sucked out, as she reaches down to help.¬†

‚ÄúOH MY GOD, TRUMAN!‚Äù she shrieked, pulling me up from my bloody concrete-skinned hand. We met face to face, as she cradled me in the warmest hug I've felt in a long time. Whether from the crisp autumn morning, or from the frigid fear I've felt from the sick Bacchus I was helping.¬†

‚ÄúIf he just would've listened, I wouldn't have to clean this up.‚Äù He quietly snapped.¬†

‚ÄúIf you weren't such a drunk BASTARD, he wouldn't have hurt himself to begin with.‚Äù Mom fired back. She helped me get back in the house, picking up the broken shard and throwing it in the garbage right next to it.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWait, honey.‚Äù He replied, placing a hand on her shoulder. She let go of me just a second to whip her hand out and smack him so hard in the face he fell, collecting the Pontiac‚Äôs plastic side mirror on his way down.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou fuckin-‚Äù he tried to mutter.¬†

‚ÄúWe. Are. Done.‚Äù she responded, as she motioned me into the house, slamming the door so hard, a picture fell off the wall. Our family portrait.¬†¬†

Everything after that was a blur of stinging pain and yelling. Mom kept me in the living room, nursing my wounds with a pack of ice and Band-Aids as yelling persisted. I don‚Äôt remember what was said. All I remember was it ending with dad taking his shitcan of plastic and depression, cranking it over, and driving off into the unknown. Tires chirping as the 90 horsepower‚Äôs of shame tried leaving marks on the old Detroit pavement.¬†¬†

Then, mom came inside. Immediately, she picked up the home phone, calling grandpa. He knows his son‚Äôs tendencies, and how abusive he can be. This isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs crossed the line. Only the second. Previously, it was over me being bullied at school. Mom wasn‚Äôt home from work yet. Instead of showing sympathy, he screamed at me over dinner for half an hour, calling me a disgrace and ‚Äúfucking useless.‚Äù Thankfully, she did end up coming home, causing me to rat him out right to their faces, leading to a verbal scuffle, and dad running off.¬†¬†

Grandpa called, hooked us up with a divorce lawyer and that was nearly it. No more fear, tears, anxiety, or feeling like I'm never good enough. But then, when he came home, he had a family meeting, or as I'd like to call it, ‚ÄúA damn good performance.‚Äù¬†

Pleading to us over and over how it‚Äôll never happen again. He‚Äôll stop drinking, spending money, and treating us like garbage. Mom didn‚Äôt 100% believe it, grandpa wanted to believe it, but I did. The lawyer was called off, and our new life began. For a week. Then this incident happened. I know better now. What he did to us, to our family, will never happen again. I just remember sitting on the couch, staring at the door, waiting for him to step through that door, like deja vu.¬†¬†

But he never did. The sunset cased through the trees, an aura of golden hues lighting the living room like a movie set, falling below the horizon as the day fades to black.¬†¬†

And nothing. Just a dull ringing filling my ears, waiting for Dad's old Pontiac to fill the void. I ended up sleeping there.¬†¬†

‚ÄúAre you ready for bed, sweetheart?‚Äù Mom asked. The clock on the wall struck 9:00.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI... I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I replied. Mom sat beside me.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWaiting for him to come back, right?‚Äù she asked.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI just... Dad always plays these games. He sets us up for something good, and just...‚Äù I trailed off.¬†

‚ÄúHe just rips the rug out from underneath you?‚Äù She filled in the blanks. Thats what dad was best at. Setting you up for a fall, so he can revel in it. Thats all he‚Äôd ever done to me. Whenever I accomplished something great, he‚Äôd always come and shoot it down. A 95% on the final exam, a silver in cross-country, a date to the school dance. All of these met with the typical answer:¬†¬†

‚ÄúThats it?‚Äù¬†

And he would just look at me, waiting for my reaction.¬†¬†

But him leaving us, finally? That would be a real treat. But I couldn‚Äôt just accept that this is it. I felt the need to wait for him to open the door and pull the rug out from under my feet. Maybe waiting for him to come back, like I'm able to predict the rug pull, will make the impact sting less.¬†¬†

But he never came home that night.¬†

‚ÄúCan I just sleep here?‚Äù I asked mom. She nodded. ‚ÄúSure. Want me to bring you down a comforter?‚Äù She asked. I nodded, as tears began to well back up. She hugged me, as I released the pain, the peril, and the stinging memory of what happened earlier. Tears grew to sobs.¬†

Why can‚Äôt he just disappear? Permanently?¬†¬†

Chapter 2¬†

I don‚Äôt remember much of that night. No dreams, or images playing through my head. Typically, if something traumatic happened, it would play through my head like a VHS tape you didn‚Äôt have to rewind. The sounds, the images, all loop over and over. But that night, I didn‚Äôt see anything. I could just feel the warmth of my blanket, shielding me from the cold October night. However, I couldn't even trust the NASCAR comforter I wrapped so tight around me.¬†

My back started to get warmer, as if an electric furnace was facing my back. The growing heat crept through my skin, penetrating my spine until my chest felt soothing warmth. Felt good. That is until the heat got brighter. It stopped feeling like a furnace and started to feel more eternal. Something primordial. It grew from gentle warmth to glowing heat. I tried to move, but I couldn't. The heat grew into a searing pain, illuminating my back, and digging into my bones. I can still feel my comforter wrapped around me like a cocoon, pinning my arms into my burning chest. Suddenly, the heat flash overed, consuming my body. I couldn't move, open my eyes; I couldn't even cry for help. For my mom, or anyone. All I could do was watch faded embers of bright light pierce through my eyelids, like an x-ray. An infinite fire alight across my helpless body, eating away at my flesh as embers fall into a seeming abyss in front of me. My eyes open for just a second, to see nothing but a burned, charred body, flashing a glance at me. Seared lips, cauterized with dried, smoking blood, cracks open for just a flash to echo a word into what's left of my broiling soul.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù¬†

Then I'm shook awake.¬†¬†

‚ÄúTRUMAN! BABY, WAKE UP!‚Äù my mom cried, pulling my blanket off, revealing my sweat-soaked pajamas.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDid you have a nightmare?‚Äù she asked. I nodded, tears welling up. She hugs me, pulling me tight as I recalled the subconscious horror.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù I faintly asked. ‚ÄúHalf pass 6.‚Äù She replied. ‚ÄúYou gotta get to school in an hour. If you want, we can talk about your nightmare? Hopefully it helps?‚Äù¬†¬†

She told me that dreams can reveal things from your subconscious. I‚Äôve never really talked about them before, but this felt important. I‚Äôve never been burned before, and yet this all felt so real. We spent the next hour talking about it over pancakes and ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù, which was mostly creamer for me.¬†

‚ÄúI haven't heard back from your father. I‚Äôll give your grandpa a call in a bit.‚Äù¬†

I nodded. I finished my mug of hot Coffee Mate and as I headed up stairs to get dressed, mom popped a question:¬†

‚ÄúMaybe you had that dream because of a scary movie dad had you watch?‚Äù¬†

He did that a lot. The Thing, The Fly, Fire in The Sky (that one film where all the aliens look like Joe Biden), all that stuff.¬†

I nodded no. There was a copy of Final Destination 3 on the counter though.¬†

‚ÄúIf he showed you the tanning bed scene, I'm skinning him alive.‚Äù mom said.¬†

Chapter 3¬†

I walked through the old, blue painted doors into the main foyer of this decrepit place. Blue and yellow stripes line walls, covered with trophy cabinets and old photos. The smell of old books, floor cleaner and the swimming pool just down the hallway could pierce through any antidepressant. Getting to my first class, I'm met with the same old classmates I've known all trimester, with the same three guys in the back of the class. A skinny, tan-skinned guy, a fat, dark-haired guy and a bald one. The one person I'd still call a friend, but every now and again the other two would be nice. They were really the only people who talked to me. That‚Äôs alright.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMaaaan, you look like shiiit!‚Äù the fat one said. ‚ÄúParker!‚Äù The teacher snapped.¬†

I shot a glance at him.¬† ‚ÄúGo to hell.‚Äù I snapped.¬†¬†

‚ÄúTRUMAN!‚Äù The teacher snapped back, as the whole class lightly gasped.¬†¬†

I took my assigned seat at the back, right next to the three. Wish Parker wasn't as much of an asshole like he used to be.¬†¬†

‚ÄúooooOOOOO, Truman swooooooore!‚Äù Parker said, under his breath. I didn‚Äôt pay attention to him as the skinny one nudged him, shooting a glance.¬†¬†

‚ÄúRough night's sleep?‚Äù The skinny one asked. ‚ÄúYeah, Issac.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou should take some melatonin, dude.‚Äù The bald one asked.¬†

‚ÄúNah Ryan, it's not that.‚Äù I rebutteled. ‚ÄúJust more family bullshi-crap. Crap.‚Äù¬†

God, let today be over.¬†¬†

Suddenly, the teachers phone rings. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù¬†¬†

We all sit in silence. ‚ÄúOk, I'll tell him. Truman, your mom‚Äôs here to pick you up.‚Äù¬†

The entire class erupts into ‚ÄúooooOOOOOs‚Äù like I got in trouble, as I grab my things and head out. ‚ÄúAwww, what happened to your dad now?‚Äù Parker jokingly snapped.¬†

The entire class stops. Dead silence, and deadpan looks at him.¬†¬†

‚ÄúGo. To. HELL.‚Äù I said, walking out as everyone, including the teacher, eyes Parker, followed by everyone barking at him, calling him an asshole.¬†¬†

I walk to the office, with my mom waiting in the doorway. Tears were in her eyes.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat happened? Is it-?‚Äù I trailed off.¬†¬†

She nodded, yes.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDad‚Äôs leaving?‚Äù I asked.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs...passed.‚Äù¬†¬†

My heart froze as I hugged my mom, hoping she‚Äôd warm me back up.¬†¬†

Is it finally over?¬†¬†

I let go, only to look behind me and see, who else but Parker, presumably getting sent down here after what he said.¬†¬†

He looked at me like a sad puppy, full of guilt. I shot a look back of scorn. He just dipped his head, and walked away, as if he wanted to say sorry, but knew it wouldn't do anything.¬†¬†

Chapter 4¬†

The funeral home was packed. Aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews I haven‚Äôt seen in years line the walls, leading to the casket of my dad‚Äôs charred remains. I didn‚Äôt cry. Just walked up to the closed casket, placed my hand on it, and searched for whatever reason I could find to mourn. Couldn't find any. I felt like a cold-blooded psychopath in a room of sobbing people. Why should I cry? Why let out a single tear after years at the hands of a drunk bully?¬†¬†

All of a sudden, my hands began to burn. The top of the casket felt like a hot skillet, leaving behind a sting, but nothing else. I turned my hands over to see pale skin, and nothing else.¬†¬†

‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù Mom asked. ¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù I answered, slightly skewed in shock and confusion.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWell, let's wrap things up and get some ice cream, alright? Shouldn‚Äôt be too much longer. Bout‚Äô half an hour.‚Äù she assured me. I nodded and let out a slight smile. Mom never let me down.¬†¬†

We got home five hours later. It was about six o‚Äôclock, and thankfully we agreed to cremation. Not like there was much to bury anyways. I shed out of my dreadful black suit, threw on some Corvette pajamas and a Dale Earnhardt shirt, about to run with mom through the McDonalds drive-thru for a hot fudge sundae, when out of nowhere, the doorbell rang.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHey, Mrs. Fields! Is Truman home?‚Äù That‚Äôs Issac. As happy as I was to see them, that also means that-¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I wanted to come by and apologize.‚Äù Aaaand that's Parker. Damnit. Well, hopefully he‚Äôs a man of his word.¬†¬†

I come downstairs to see the guys. Issac, Ryan, and... Parker.¬†

‚ÄúHey, man. Look, I-I'm sorry for what I said.‚Äù Parker said.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWe just wanted to stop by and make sure you‚Äôre doing alright.‚Äù Issac said.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWell, we were just going to run down to McDonalds for some ice cream, if you guys wanted to come with?‚Äù Mom asked, which was met with gasps and ‚ÄúHell yeah‚Äôs‚Äù.¬†¬†

Suddenly, we heard a loud, muffled crash from the garage. We all froze.¬†

Honey, could you go check that out? I need to grab my purse.‚Äù Mom asked. ‚ÄúI'll come with!‚Äù Parker insisted.¬†¬†

We walked through the door to the mudroom, just outside the garage, when Parker stopped me.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHey, so. Look, I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to lose someone close like that. So, I don‚Äôt fully understand what it feels like. I know I‚Äôve been a bit of a dick these past few months, and that was probably the last thing I should've done.‚Äù Parker explained.¬†

Well, it's certainly better than just ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù I stare at him as he continued.¬†

‚ÄúJust...whatever I can do to make it up to you, I'll do it. I‚Äôm just...really sorry. Even if saying it isn't enough, I‚Äôm just really really sorry. Can we still be friends?‚Äù¬†

I was shocked. I just nodded and said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúOk, then one last thing. Why did you keep your dad‚Äôs car?‚Äù¬†

I froze. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù He shot me a confused look, only to point out through the window in the door, a melted, charred, automotive carcass.¬†¬†

Slowly, I opened the door, walking into a room filled with the smell of rotting metal and burned plastic. The tires were liquified wrapped around corroded wheels, sagging into the pavement. The bumpers, fenders and quarter panels were all dried, melted, and gray goo.¬†¬†

¬†The bare chassis was all that remained of what once was a Fiero.¬†¬†

My dad‚Äôs Fiero. And I could tell by the seared pieces of bones and a wedding ring, sitting in the remains of the footwell.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been two weeks since the accident. How...?‚Äù¬†

I was frozen. Couldn't say a word as Parker walked around the corpse.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHeh, almost as if he-‚Äù he trailed off. ‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù He finished, as he walked to the front.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs odd.‚Äù He added. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúWell, despite all the damage, for some reason, the front bumper looks...fine?‚Äù Parker said, as he leaned in front of the remains.¬†

He wasn‚Äôt wrong. It looked brand new. Polished, waxed, fresh. I started walking towards the door, trying to get my mom when suddenly, the smell of burnt metal began emanating towards the door, followed by a metal click. The door locked itself. The smell dissipated.¬†¬†

Then, the wheels began to turn.¬†¬†

Melted rubber slowly cracked and creaked as the rims rotated forward, inching further and further.¬†

It spooked Parker. He pushed against the bumper, stopping it. ‚ÄúHa! Nice try-‚Äù He stopped noticing me by the door. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not pushing it?‚Äù He asked. His voice was cold as mine. I nodded no. Then the wheels began turning again. Stronger. He started pushing back, falling backwards onto the wall as the Fiero inched closer and closer. I try and pull on the b-pillar, only to burn my hands in the process. Like on the casket.¬†

‚ÄúHey, man get me out of here. I don-‚Äù He was cut off by the sound of crunching plastic pinning his shins into the wall. He yelled in pain as the grille slid forward. I ran over, grabbing his arms, pulling with all I could. Amidst the skirmish, we both looked down.¬†

The grill was opening like a mouth. A slow, loud gasp of air emanated from the vehicle as suddenly, an earth-like snap made Parker fall to his knees. A powerful suction grew from the grill, now a gaping maw, as his shins snapped in half before collapsing into the vent. I grabbed tightly onto him as I looked back at the car.¬†¬†

It was growing from the bumper, forming a new, shiny red hood as the vent consumed his legs up to his knees.¬†¬†

Then, it stopped.¬†¬†

Parker, now a sobbing mass of blood and tears on the floor, looks on. ‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!‚Äù He screamed from the depths of his soul.¬†¬†

Just beyond the hood, in the tattered remains of the interior, a small green light grew, reflecting onto the bare metal bodywork. The aftermarket CD player turned on.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIf I could tuuuurn back time. If I could find a way...‚Äù faintly booms over ruined speakers. It was one of dad's favorite songs.¬†¬†

Then, the engine turned on.¬†¬†

An explosion of noise rocked the car, now half-way formed, followed by a red, warm mist rocketing out of the rear, like a geyser, covering the entire garage door. We didn't have long to look, because then, Parker was ripped out of my hands, falling into the gaping maw with a deafening shriek.¬†¬†

The cracking of bones and cartilage rang through the cooling vents, running into the mid-engined grinder. I grab onto what's left of his hands as he‚Äôs consumed all the way to his chest. The middle divider of the front grille sliced into his abdomen, parting him like a saw, as his face grew ghostly white. I could only hold onto his hand for so long, until with one big, metallic creak, he was consumed.

I looked down at my hands, my clothes, the ground, and everything. Before I had a second to react, I slipped. My head smacked the wall behind me, as I fell to the floor with a hard thud. The door bursts open.¬†

‚ÄúTruman, what happened?‚Äù Mom asks, before looking up, and shrieking like I've never heard before. I look up to see a perfectly clean garage. No blood, no damage, no Parker. All with a shiny, red Pontiac Fiero, sitting right in the middle of it.¬†¬†

A muffled song can only be heard booming from the interior.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIf I could tuuuurn back time...‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHey, Kenny! This is for scrap?!‚Äù a man asks, standing next to a red Fiero.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I dunno whats wrong with it, but whoever dropped it off was dead set on it getting crushed.‚Äù Kenny replies. ‚ÄúSomething about a fire risk?‚Äù He finished.¬†

‚ÄúGot the keys?‚Äù The man asks.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYeah, just a second.‚Äù Kenny replies, walking into the main office of the scrapyard.¬†¬†

The man walks to the driver side door, only to see its unlocked. He hops in, taking a look. ‚ÄúJesus Christ, this thing‚Äôs perfect!‚Äù A shiny, black dash next to pristine, maroon leather seats, and a four-speed manual he‚Äôs able to click right into gear.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThis thing‚Äôs...getting crushed?‚Äù He mutters to himself.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYeah, apparently!‚Äù Kenny pops up, startling the man.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDude. I‚Äôm taking this. This can NOT be crushed.‚Äù He says, being handed the keys. He puts them into the ignition, turns it over, and the engine roars to life.¬†¬†

\-¬†

‚ÄúYeah, they just let me take it home!‚Äù He says, after pulling the car into his garage.¬†¬†

‚ÄúOk, Tom. Just make sure whatever fire risks are fixed.‚Äù The friend over the phone says.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna look around. Something has to be wrong with it.‚Äù He says.¬†¬†

‚ÄúTake it easy.‚Äù He finishes, as he closes his phone, leaving only him, the Fiero, and a strange noise emanating from the car.¬†¬†

He pops the rear hood, looking around for the source of the noise, only to find a soft, glowing light from around the corner of the engine bay. The catalytic converter was glowing hot.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs...fuckin weird. I‚Äôm only a mile away from work.‚Äù He mutters to himself as he pulls his head out from the engine bay. He grabs two bricks to block the front wheels as he jacks up the rear. Pulling his creeper underneath, the sound grows into a moaning. He starts to undo the oxygen sensor, then the bolts attached to the Catalytic Converter, until the whole piece comes off the exhaust.¬†¬†

Walking towards the tool bench, the piece of exhaust is glowing red, vibrating, and now smoking hot as he sets it down to grab some welding gloves.¬†¬†

Looking down the center pipe, all he can see is a glowing red face.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYour turn.‚Äù¬†¬†

Within the blink of an eye, his entire body is sucked into the pipe.¬†

I'm relatively new to Hackintosh, but I have prior experience with multiboot setups and general OS installations. I've successfully installed macOS Ventura on both my Lenovo M720q desktop and X280 laptop with full Intel iGPU acceleration.

Recently, I picked up a Lenovo M920t and managed to install macOS Sequoia. The install went through fine, but I'm currently stuck with only 7MB VRAM and no proper Intel graphics acceleration. After logging in, the desktop goes white‚Äîno wallpaper shows‚Äîand the system becomes sluggish, which I suspect is due to missing or incorrect GPU configurations.

I can see the wallpaper briefly at the login screen, but once logged in, it turns white. I've tried device-id spoofing, followed the Dortania guide, attempted framebuffer patching, but no luck so far.

I've attached my system specs, current EFI folder, and relevant screenshots for reference. Apologies for the long post and all the attachments‚Äîjust trying to provide everything that might help.

Appreciate any guidance you can offer!

Let me break down each major island to help you decide which paradise fits your style.

Oahu - The Gathering Place
Perfect for first-time visitors who want a mix of everything. You'll find bustling city life in Honolulu, iconic Waikiki Beach, historic sites like Pearl Harbor, and plenty of shopping. The North Shore offers a more laid-back vibe with world-famous surf spots.

My absolute favorite experience on Oahu was taking a doors-off helicopter tour. Seeing the island from above gave me a whole new perspective - from hidden waterfalls to the stunning Ko'olau mountains. I booked through this link (https://athometouch.com/Honolulu) and it was worth every penny. The aerial views of Diamond Head and Pearl Harbor were unforgettable.

Maui - The Valley Isle
Choose Maui if you're seeking a balance between development and natural beauty. The Road to Hana, Haleakala National Park, and pristine beaches make it perfect for adventurers who still want comfortable amenities. Great for honeymoons and romantic getaways.

Big Island - Hawaii
This island is for nature lovers and those fascinated by active volcanoes. It's less developed than Oahu or Maui but offers unique experiences like night manta ray diving, coffee farm tours, and watching lava flows. The climate zones here are incredibly diverse.

Kauai - The Garden Isle
The most tropical and pristine of the main islands. If you're looking to escape crowds and immerse yourself in nature, Kauai's your spot. The Napali Coast, Waimea Canyon, and lush forests make it a hiking paradise.

Some practical tips for choosing:
- Consider flight costs and connections
- Think about your must-do activities
- Factor in travel time between spots
- Check weather patterns for your dates
- Consider your comfort with different levels of development

For first-timers, I usually recommend Oahu. It's easy to navigate, has excellent infrastructure, and offers something for everyone. Plus, those helicopter tours I mentioned earlier give you an incredible overview of the island's diversity. They regularly sell out though, so book early if you're interested.

Bottom line: There's no ""wrong"" choice - each island has its own magic. But matching the island to your travel style will make your Hawaiian vacation even more special.

Also if anyone has any advice/feedback that would be appreciated too :)

I'm a 38 year old male and have had RLS since I was 12. Starting around when I turned 30 is when it became unbearable and moved to my arms and chest on a nightly basis. I spent years powering through at work by taking 20 min naps in my car and drinking unhealthy amounts of coffee.

I've been on various treatments throughout the years with not many benefits which includes (in order):

\-Mirapex/Pramipexole: bad side effects including increased risk-taking along with attitude changes

\-Gabapentin and later Pregabalin - didn't work that well, it also lowered my IQ especially around spatial reasoning, this was a no-go for me working in data and computer science jobs

\-Carbidopa-Levodopa: Similar side-effects to Mirapex. It would leave my legs but I would still get it in left arm and sometimes chest. Also had what felt similar to an alcohol hangover in the morning.

\-Kratom: This worked better than any of the other options, but was short-lasting. I would take 2-3 grams before bed before waking up at 3AM where I would take another 1.5 grams. I would feel a weird slight hangover from it but was definitely better than not getting any sleep.

After this my neuro categorized my condition as being ""refractory"" and had me try Tramadol 50 mg. This was ineffective so she upped it to 100 mg, which like the kratom was effective for a short period of time and I would get it again between 2-3AM every night.

We then switched to methadone 5mg 3 months ago which was the first drug that worked and nearly completely rid me of RLS. I would still get it a couple nights/week but it was mild and I could walk it off after 10 minutes and it wouldn't return, it wasn't worth upping the dosage. Unfortunately this made me feel sedated and depressed all the time and I didn't have much energy.

My neuro then referred me to a pain clinic where we switched to OxyContin 10mg. It is shorter lasting and effective, though the current dose is a little low and I still get mild symptoms every night (we are planning on gradually upping this soon). This option is not as long-lasting as the methadone but I still have some low energy and depressed (though not as bad as the methadone). I'm not sure if it is entirely from this as I have had other stressful issues come up such as working long weeks w/o a vacation along with a couple of other stressful events that could be contributing to that too and causing burnout.

After sharing this info with my doctor he is having me get my testosterone levels checked next week and wants to start exploring injections. 

I am staying cautiously optimistic that we are on the right track and just hoping I get my energy back soon.

[No budget],"I just took delivery of a Profitec Go from Whole Latte Love and, a little too late, I discovered that the rubber hose that connects the reservoir to the pump had a tiny rupture, which may have led to a damaged pump. It also leaked water everywhere, but that isn't the issue. While I'm not too worried about finding a replacement hose at a good plumbing supply company, I AM worried about any damage this may have caused the pump. Ya see, I set it all up in accordance with the instructions and then, in accordance with the manual, I let it run for ""at least 30 seconds until water is being dispensed from the brew group before pressing the coffee button again to stop filling the boiler."" It was loud -clearly the result of cavitation in the pump, which was straining to pull in water through a leaky hose. I incorrectly allowed the pump to operate dry for approximately 45 seconds before it finally pulled in enough water (against the leaky tube) to stop straining. In hindsight, I realized that the abnormally loud pump noise was due to cavitation, which I know can result in damage.

Should I demand a replacement pump or a whole new machine under warranty? Or just replace the hose and hope for the best?

I‚Äôm hoping to hear some advice or thoughts from you all.**



I think I have a kind of *physical attraction* toward my friend. Every time I see him, I feel this strong urge to hug him, to get close to him‚Äîeven smell his scent (and yes, sometimes I have even more intimate thoughts). But I‚Äôve always kept those feelings to myself.



I‚Äôm 30, he‚Äôs 26. There‚Äôs something about him that feels so adorable and dependable. I love eating with him, hiking together, city walking‚Äîhonestly, even just grabbing a coffee with him brightens my whole day. No exaggeration: spending time with him can wash away all the tiredness I carry.



But in our group chat, he‚Äôs made it clear that he‚Äôs ‚Äúmale, straight, and into women.‚Äù There are three of us in the group‚Äîme, him, and a woman who used to be our colleague. We all worked at the same company before but have since moved on. The three of us still meet up occasionally, usually with the female friend driving us around to eat, hang out, or do things together.



Most of my interactions with him are limited to the group chat. He rarely talks to me one-on-one, and even when I message him privately, the conversations are short. Most of our communication happens in the group, where we joke around or share memes from the internet. But even just chatting with him there makes me happy.



I keep trying to find signs‚Äîany small clue‚Äîthat maybe he likes me back, but it‚Äôs hard to find any. And it often leaves me feeling frustrated and hopeless. I‚Äôve broken down and cried at night more times than I can count because of my feelings for him.



Not long ago, I lost my job and went on a solo hike in the desert. After coming back, I brought him some local specialties from the cities I passed through. But he ended up sharing them with our female friend instead, which hurt me deeply. It made me feel like, in his eyes, I‚Äôm nothing more than just ‚Äúa buddy from the group chat.‚Äù



I‚Äôve tried expressing my affection in other ways‚Äîcarefully picking out birthday gifts, bringing him coffee at work, treating him to nice meals. I‚Äôve done everything I could think of to show him how much I care.



A while back, we had a disagreement because of that local gift situation. I was upset, so I visited a scenic spot the two of us once went to together, and I even posted about it on social media to show how much I missed those happy moments. But he saw the post and didn‚Äôt respond at all.



I think he knows how I feel, but he chose to respond in his own way‚Äîby sticking to group settings and keeping things light, as if to say:

**‚ÄúDo you like me?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúNo‚Äîwe‚Äôre just bros.‚Äù**



And that hurts. Sometimes I can‚Äôt stop myself from crying. I‚Äôm getting older, and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship. The idea of purely liking someone with all my heart seems to get harder as the years go by. Whenever I think about that, I feel even more hopeless and sad about my life.

I threw the flowers on the floor and stomped on them before storming out of that place pushing Jessica in the process before storming out of the venue mad as the devil he tried to run after me, but he tripped and fell. As people were helping him up and also looking at the disaster. Wow when I made it home, I slammed the door and locked it and crashed into bed, since he wanted to cheat on me, I'm gonna make both of their lives hell. The next day I started gathering evidence of the cheating and fraud. See my sister used to be an influencer with her beauty until one day somebody assaulted and ruined her face so when she finally found a job as a office cleaner when she was doing her knife shifts, she took money from out the cash register and slipped them in her pocket when she was cleaning and she did it every day until the company went downhill and no more money was coming, so she just quit. She didn't answer that she started hunting for husbands until she found mine and while I was still dating him had an affair and then after he left when she took a test, she was pregnant and when she told him he was shocked and also scared told her to abort the baby, but she said no and said that she's keeping the baby and that he better pay child support but then he said abort. The child I already with someone and she just lost it started spamming him started calling him until he blocked her number and she just gave up until she gave birth found out that I  was getting married today and so happened to break down the door before I kiss someone who was kissing somebody else's lips after I got her keys, I went to go to my boyfriend's case I found out that he did fraud too, but by stealing from his manager at a coffee shop until he got fired for being rude to a customer. So that's how they got together I said to myself. After building both cases, my husband and my sister, both for the building cases about me and fake news. Saying that I was a fraud mentally unstable and makes up lies as the Photoshop images together of me acting crazy and me holding a baby doll that I never had. They wanted to ruin me so they can get together since he apologized to his baby girl, so I was making sure the hell had a special place with them when they die and then my lawyer called me saying that we had a meeting with Jessica and my husband, Jack when I got there the court hearing was already starting. They started making fake announcements about how I was mentally ill. I had done fraud and then I was and I was crazy and they probably thought that making a random court hearing will probably get me jail time because you think I never had evidence but then I brought out my detective and my papers of what they done and flatten them out on the paint table and then I started reading them Jessica fraud, has stole from her office multiple times until she left because it went downhill Jack fraud, stole money from his job as a coffee worker got fired for yelling at a customer. The judge looked astonish and astonishment, turned to anger as he turned to the both of them your claims have been dismissed. You both for spin five years in prison for fraud and false report. As they walked away with handcuffs, Jessica looked at me one more time with a serious glare that can kill ghost and now that I'm posting this right now, I'm happy that they're still in jail. I'm 23 now living in my own apartment and they'll be getting out of jail in two years probably less that they keep acting good. Hopefully they don't come back to kill me or report me again hopefully I'm safe.

A customer who threw off my day. I‚Äôm usually pretty chill when a customer comes in and wants some bastardized coffee and calls it a regular coffee name, but this one nearly broke my patience (and I‚Äôve worked with kids of all ages and surgeons. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm quite patient). 

I had a patient order ‚Äútwo iced dopios to go.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs been unusually hot here this week, so we‚Äôre icing a lot of drinks. Shots on ice aren‚Äôt uncommon for my area. I pull down two 8oz to-go cups, ice down shots in each. She asks for half & half. I grab the half & half and ask ‚Äúbig splash or little?‚Äù and she says ‚Äúwell, fill it up‚Ä¶‚Äù and then looks at the cup and says ‚Äúis that the biggest cup you have?‚Äù

By now, I‚Äôm confused, so I stop and think for a second and say ‚Äúno‚Ä¶ what cup size would you like?‚Äù She gets a bit miffed at my open ended question, and so I pull down a 12oz cup to show her, and she says ‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs better‚Äù. I switch cups, and she says ‚Äúwell, fill that one up.‚Äù I kinda take a moment to keep my face less perplexed and then turn back to her and ask ‚Äúyou want two shots and ice and then filled with half & half?‚Äù She says ‚Äúyes, a *dopio*‚Äù in this tone that lets me know she thinks I‚Äôm an idiot, emphasizing ‚Äúdopio‚Äù as though I didn‚Äôt hear her correctly before. 

I filled the cups up with half & half, set them on the counter and go to ring her out. She took one sip, set it back down and said ‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs a dopio‚Äù as though she was relieved we finally reached the end. 

I rang her out for two 12 oz breve lattes and she paid and left. She got a receipt, and in my mind I imagine her showing someone the receipt all upset and that person tells her she‚Äôs an idiot. Imagining this, even if it‚Äôs very unlikely to occur or in any way change her habits, just makes me feel better. Her tones and body language were so gross and got worse throughout the interaction. 

This is one reason I like to make drinks before charging on slow days, especially when it‚Äôs just me behind the counter. Two shots on ice is far different in price than a 12oz breve latte on ice. ",17,1752287161.0,barista,8,1.0,False
