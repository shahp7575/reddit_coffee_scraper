1o4290p,https://i.redd.it/opem868wuiuf1.jpeg,Halloween movie night party for young adults in southern Brooklyn,"The Marine Park Young Adults Association is excited to host our Second Annual Halloween Movie Night Party on Friday, October 17th at 5 PM at Marine Park Coffee, located at 3411 Avenue S. This year‚Äôs celebration will feature a double horror movie event perfect for spooky season.

We‚Äôll kick off the night with Halloween II (1981), directed by John Carpenter, which is often regarded as the best sequel to the original 1978 classic. The film picks up right where Halloween left off, continuing the terrifying story of ‚Äúthe night he came home‚Äù as Michael Myers stalks Haddonfield once more. While suspenseful, Halloween II is considered less frightening than many modern horror films, making it a great entry point for those who want a Halloween scare without being overwhelmed.

Following that, we‚Äôll show Barbarian (2022), a modern horror thriller directed by Zach Cregger, who has recently earned critical acclaim for his new release Weapons. Barbarian is filled with chilling twists and a more intense atmosphere, creating a scarier and more shocking experience compared to the classic slasher style of Halloween II. To make the night flexible and welcoming for everyone, guests are encouraged to come for one or both films ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to stay for the entire double feature.

To add to the fun, we‚Äôll be awarding a prize for Best Costume, with the winner receiving a gift from a local restaurant chosen by our Board. Attendees can also enjoy free popcorn, candy, and soft drinks throughout the evening.

The event has just a $5 cover fee at the door and is open to young adults ages 18 to 35. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of classic slashers, modern horror hits, or just looking for a fun community night out, this event promises to deliver a memorable evening of scares, laughs, and Halloween cheer.

Please reach out to Sam, the President of the Marine Park Young Adults Association, at sam@marineparkyoungadults.org for more information or if you have any questions for the event.",1,1760205576.0,Flatbush,0,1.0,False

I used to say the same thing. For years.

Then one day I realized: The difference between people who dream about writing and people who actually publish isn't talent. It's not even time. It's having a clear process and just... starting.

So I stopped making excuses and figured it out. The messy, imperfect, ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" way. And you know what? It worked.

I turned ""Meal Prep for Busy Parents"" from a random idea into a published eBook that actually helps people and generates income. No fancy writing degree. No expensive courses. Just a system that worked.

And here's the truth I wish someone had told me sooner:

Your knowledge matters. Someone out there is desperately Googling for answers you already have. That thing you think is ""too obvious"" or ""everyone knows this""? They don't. They need YOU to explain it.

You don't need to be perfect. You don't need months of free time. You just need to start.

I documented everything - how I chose my topic, planned without drowning in overwhelm, wrote my first draft without perfectionism killing my momentum, edited my rough ideas into something I was proud of, and published without breaking the bank.

If you've been waiting for a sign to finally write that book... this is it.

Here's what actually works (after 500+ failed attempts),"I've tried every morning routine you can imagine. 5am wake-ups. Cold showers. Meditation. Journaling. Green smoothies. That whole ""miracle morning"" thing.

Each one lasted maybe a week before I'd hit snooze and feel like a failure.

The problem wasn't discipline. It was that I was copying someone else's ideal morning instead of designing my own.

Here's what I learned after countless failures:

Your morning routine doesn't need to be impressive. It needs to be yours.

My current routine? Embarrassingly simple:
- Wake up (no specific time, just consistent sleep)
- Coffee
- 10 minutes deciding my top 3 priorities for the day
- Start working on priority #1

That's it. No meditation app. No ice bath. No 47-step ritual.

Some mornings I add a walk. Some mornings I don't. The core stays the same because it's so stupidly easy I can't fail at it.

The shift happened when I stopped asking ""What should I do?"" and started asking ""What would make today feel manageable?""

Turns out, clarity beats complexity. Knowing what matters today beats having the perfect morning aesthetic.

I wasted years chasing routines that looked good on paper. Routines designed by people with different lives, different energy, different brains.

The routine that works is the one you'll actually do tomorrow. Not the one that sounds impressive. Not the one that works for some productivity influencer.

Start small. Stay consistent. Adjust as you go.

That's the only morning routine advice that ever stuck for me.

""They're in the kitchen with your suit,"" the love of my life called back. ""I moved them this morning to be sure you wouldn't forget to wear them.""

Well, the love of my life except in moments when she moves my things without telling me. Then she becomes the irritation of my life.

'Safety first, fun last,' I thought to myself as I finished putting on the underlayer for my void suit. I already suspected the situation was going to be a bit more potentially dangerous than Skylar let on, although I thought my wife was overdoing it by insisting I wear the void suit and full safety plates. But as any married sapient can tell you, the words ""Yes, dear!"" will save your life and sanity. So, if my wife insisted on the void suit with armor plates, I'd wear the damn things.¬†

Finished with the suit underlayer, I stretched all four of my legs to test the fit and looked around. Datapad, Galactic ID, and my pouch of hard currency chits were ready for me to grab and go.

Honestly, I didn't need the hard currency, but it was useful to buy things that wouldn't show up on the joint account I had with my wife. We trusted each other in everything, yet my wife didn't need to know how many tapioca puddings I got from the human commissary.

I don't know exactly what's in tapioca pudding. Probably a narcotic of some kind since humans enjoy consuming strange and deadly substances of all types (I mean seriously, who drinks an industrial thinner like ethanol for fun?!?!?). I know the pudding isn't healthy but it's addicting. My wife just doesn't need to see charges from the commissary on a daily basis and yell at me for eating junk food.

Datapad, ID, and hard currency collected, I took in a deep breath and headed to the kitchen to grab my packed midday meal. Unlike humans and most other creatures, we don't need food or beverages to wake up. We stack energy reserves and only plan daily meal intakes to be polite with other sapient beings during mandatory meal breaks. Left to our own devices, we She‚Äôkari would eat only once per week as biology demands.

This is in stark contrast to my carpool ride today, Skylar. She seems to ingest copious amounts of a disgusting liquid called coffee along with any baked goods she can get her hands on every morning, and she is an absolute short-tempered nightmare until both beverages and confections are consumed.¬†

I paused for a moment as I realized she would be responsible for driving me to work. Before consuming coffee or baked goods. Perhaps carpooling was a bad idea? But curiosity had gotten the better of me, and it was too late now.¬†

My wife rubbed a claw along my side in a gesture of affection before helping me put on my void suit and the armor plates. Once done, I stood up and looked myself over. Encased in a Shanditech void suit with full safety plates, it would take a supernova to hurt me.¬†

I leaned over and picked up the two food containers and held them in my claws for a moment. Outside, there was a loud rumbling along with the beeping of a human vehicular horn.

""Remember, she only gets this if she behaves,"" my wife reminded me as she tapped on the second portable food container.

I splayed my front legs in acquiescence, earning a satisfied hum from my wife. I headed to the door and put on my void suit helmet. Activating the exterior speakers and microphone, I opened the door and stepped out into the day.

At the end of the path to my front door was Skylar wearing little more than her Terran Embassy uniform and a helmet. Behind her was the contraption that had so fascinated me, a two wheeled vehicle she said was a Harley. And evidently, the old combustion machine was tuned to run on ethanol rather than something called gasoline. She joked that if she had a rough day, she could suck out some of the fuel to get drunk. She also mentioned that if she ever ran out of fuel all she needed to do would be stop off at a bar or liquor store and get something at least 150 proofs.

This was one of many boasts about humanity I needed her to explain at some point. I wasn‚Äôt sure exactly what the connection was between ethanol and mathematical or physics proofs. Knowing what I do about humanity, it‚Äôs probably some strange correlation between the number of mathematical proofs the average human can solve after drinking a set amount of ethanol.

In any case, there was something disturbing about a vehicle that ran on a human intoxicant (realistically, an industrial solvent no matter what humans claim).¬†

As I approached, Skylar took off her helmet and looked at me with a rather annoyed expression. It was at this point I wondered if she was calm enough to drive, or if she required coffee or another human energy beverage first. Perhaps one of those things she called a donut?

‚ÄúReally, Rak‚Äôall?‚Äù she said as she looked over my void suit. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just going to the embassy, not into orbit. There‚Äôs no need for a fully armored void suit.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have doubts as to the safety of this vehicle, as does my wife,‚Äù I stated firmly. ‚ÄúIf I recall my research correctly, even humans sometimes refer to motorcycles as ‚Äòdonor cycles‚Äô due to their danger. While I am interested in satisfying my curiosity about this mode of transport, I am not willing to put my life at risk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI promised your wife I wouldn‚Äôt go over 30mph!‚Äù she grumbled at me.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I said flatly. ‚ÄúShe has observed your desire and ability to go from naught to faster than acceptable on inhabited roads. If I remember correctly, it takes you less than two seconds to exceed 30mph on this Harley of yours.‚Äù

Skylar rolled her eyes at me before responding. ‚ÄúShe threatened to permanently take away her baked scoladin if I put you in danger or go too fast. Trust me. I‚Äôll get you to work safely.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe shall see,‚Äù I said blandly. I trusted her and was curious to feel what it was like to ride on a motorcycle, but I also trusted my wife and knew this could be more dangerous than anticipated.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget!‚Äù my wife called from the door to my home. ‚ÄúI have GPS tracking on my datapad. I‚Äôll know if you go too fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh. She needs to learn to trust me,‚Äù Skylar mumbled under her breath as she put on her helmet and helped me onto the back of her Harley.

‚ÄúAfter the skateboarding incident, do you blame her?‚Äù I asked my human friend and coworker.

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt count! There was alcohol and a double dare involved,‚Äù Skylar responded with frustration. ‚ÄúAnd in this case, she has already threatened to take away scoladin. There are two things humans take very seriously. All things furry and baked goods. As much as I like to ride fast, I‚Äôm not going to lose her scoladin over a ride to work.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù I said calmly while taking a deep breath. I hoped the upcoming ride to work on her Harley would be as thrilling as Skylar promised.¬†

‚ÄúBesides, we need to build her trust,‚Äù she mused thoughtfully. ‚ÄúI figure 4 or 5 times of safely carpooling and she‚Äôll turn off the GPS tracking. Then you‚Äôll get to experience just what a Harley can do, and I‚Äôll still get yummy baked goods.‚Äù

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it!

This is also a quick reminder that I‚Äôm not dead yet. There will be more Haasha, Center of Attention, and Leave No Witnesses stuff soon! Life just got a little crazy at work these past few weeks.

1o422dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1o422dl/the_text_message_that_changed_how_i_think_about/,The text message that changed how I think about online dating,"Last year I sent what I thought was the worst first message of my life. I was matching with someone whose profile mentioned they were reading a specific philosophy book - one I'd actually read and had strong opinions about. 

My usual approach would have been something generic like ""I see you're into philosophy, that's cool!"" But I was feeling frustrated with dating apps and decided to just be completely honest about my thoughts. 

I sent: ""I noticed you're reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. I have to ask - did the chapter on free will vs determinism make you question everything about personal responsibility, or was that just me having an existential crisis in a coffee shop?"" 

I immediately regretted it. Too long, too intense, too specific. She was going to think I was weird or pretentious. I almost deleted the app. 

Three hours later she responded with a paragraph about how that exact chapter had kept her up until 2 AM questioning her life choices, and how refreshing it was to have someone actually engage with the ideas instead of just saying ""I like smart girls."" 

That conversation lasted three weeks. We met for coffee and talked for four hours about everything from philosophy to childhood memories to career dreams. Even though we ultimately weren't romantically compatible, she became a good friend and taught me something crucial about communication. 

The ""worst"" message worked because it was genuinely me. It showed I had actually read her profile, engaged with her interests on a meaningful level, and wasn't afraid to be vulnerable about my own experience with the topic.

I started applying this approach to all my messages: instead of trying to be universally appealing, I focused on being specifically appealing to people who would appreciate my authentic thoughts and interests. 

Some people didn't respond - and that was actually good. They self-selected out, saving both of us time. But the people who did respond were genuinely excited to have deeper conversations from the start. 

My response rate went from about 15% to over 60%, and more importantly, the conversations were so much more engaging. I wasn't performing a version of myself I thought they'd like; I was showing up as who I actually am",3,1760205127.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

After the meeting one of the couples struck up a conversation and per usual, my husband disappeared and left the 3 of us talking for 10 minutes before we all dispersed. 

He‚Äôs a great dad, excellent husband, partner and provider but he doesn‚Äôt see the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù in what he considers pointless so social interactions‚Ä¶.he has no desire to chat, attend events, help friends move, visit people we know in the hospital, go to funerals, etc.

I started wondering this morning over coffee‚Ä¶..do men not realize that we need community and a support network? 

Do they not realize that, like anything else in life, you get out what you put in and social rewards require social investments? 

Over the years, all these little conversations, volunteering, attending community sporting events, going to weddings, funerals, showers, etc. all build a social network which (should) be there for you in times of trouble to support, uplift, encourage and care for you.

Especially later in life when health issues are inevitable and earlier in life when, God forbid, tragedy occur your family. 

Most of the couples I know, if the husband does participate, it‚Äôs only when the wife drags him or nags him. ü§£

Over the past three months, I‚Äôve been cutting down gradually.
At first, I drank the same amount but had my last cup at 3 p.m. Then I reduced it to 1 liter (about 4 cups), last cup still at 3 p.m. After that, 1 liter before noon, that went on for a couple of months.
Next, I cut down to 0.75 liters (3 cups), then 0.5 liters (2 cups), and for the past two weeks I‚Äôve only had about 300 ml (1¬º cups) a day, with my last cup around 10 a.m.

And for these last two weeks, I‚Äôve been unbelievably tired, completely exhausted. I didn‚Äôt think it could get any worse.
But it did!

Now I‚Äôm on my third day without coffee at all! I‚Äôm super proud of myself. I‚Äôve got a bit of a headache, but not as bad as the last couple of weeks. The tiredness, though, it‚Äôs extreme! I can hardly stay awake even though I‚Äôm sleeping well.
My sleep quality has really improved, I fall asleep quickly (something I almost never used to do), I sleep deeply, and for much longer than before.

How long does it take before I feel somewhat balanced again, energy-wise? I absolutely refuse to start drinking coffee again!

When Alex's best friend Heather moves back into town, with my boundaries repeatedly ignored and my fiance's attention on her.
I was watching they walk arm in arm through a party like a couple... While I was left behind to fetch her drink.
She monopolized his time. It also seems to have taken my place.
When I came back, they were gone, but when I found him, he didn't seem alone.
I walked in on a scene that felt far too intimate to be between ""just friends.""
His 6'3"" frame engulfed her. She was tucked into his chest, cocooned in his arms, and he was gently rubbing her back.
 She looked like a woman in love.
His head snapped up the moment I walked in, and the look in his eyes held my attention, wide, startled, guilty. He knew exactly how this looked, and more importantly, he knew I wouldn't be okay with it. 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The moment I saw Alexander Bradshaw, I knew my life had changed forever. I had thought those moments only happened in movies. Eyes meeting across a crowded room, the world falling silent, everything else fading away. But there he was, ignoring everyone attempting to get his attention, his sole focus on me as he made his way across the party. I could see it in his eyes, he was feeling exactly what I was.
We moved seamlessly into each other's lives after that night. Our friend groups melded together in a way that neither of us expected, which I saw as confirmation that we belonged in each other's lives. My parents adored him. He and my father started golfing every Sunday morning, and Mom would break out her famous banana pudding every time we came for dinner because she knew how much he loved it.
While I never thought Catherine would be the type to sit and chat over coffee, she approved of our relationship and made me feel as welcome as someone like her could. Alex's family had a carefully crafted image to uphold, and marrying the daughter of a Supreme Court justice was certainly an asset. I don't believe it was intentional, time spent with Catherine and Joseph often felt like a brand meeting. Cataloging every move we made and debating the optics. But Alex never made me feel that way.
Until recently, Alexander had made me feel cherished and adored. He'd been my other half, my best friend.
Until six months ago, when his best friend moved home.
Heather and Alex have been close since high school. She transferred to his elite private school after she won a scholarship sophomore year. The girl from the wrong side of the tracks thrust into a world of entitled trust fund babies. She wasn't the girl with the designer clothes or expensive hand bags taken from Mom's closet. The mean girls never let her forget exactly where she came from and Alex, being the natural protector he is, took her under his wing. He was never the kind of person who would judge someone for not being as wealthy and he would never allow someone to be treated badly due to circumstances out of their control. I admire that about him.
His mother wasn't happy about it. Heather's Dad was in jail and when Catherine found out she forbade Alex from having anything to do with her. He refused, of course he refused. Alex would never abandon his friend. His loyalty and fierce protection of the people he loves is a core part of who he is. Once he accepts someone as his family, that's it. And Heather had become part of his family. The more Cathrine tried to push her out of his life the closer he pulled her in. Over the last 10 years he's continued the roll of her confidant and protector, her best friend.
Their friends have given me the rundown of their history and while Alex has told me his feelings for her have been nothing more than platonic and assured me their relationship was never romantic it's pretty clear that for a while everyone, including Heather believed it would be. They made plans for a new future together. A life in New York. Away from parents expectations and societal pressure.
But then Alexander 's father Joseph was diagnosed with cancer.
All their grand plans were ruined. Alex was Columbia bound and Heather had gotten into a prestigious program for young artists, but when Joseph's condition worsened familial guilt set it. His father had wanted him at the family alma mater, Georgetown and Alex couldn't bear the thought of being far away if the worst happened. She was understanding when he told her he wouldn't be joining her in New York. It seemed to work out for everyone. Joseph was cancer free after a grueling 3 year battle, Heather made a name for herself with packed galleries that led to sold out collections. She was no longer the girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Alexander would go to Georgetown like his father and he and I would meet on our first official day of law school.
I was warned to stay away from men with a ""Female best friend"". But I wasn't insecure. He had a vast friend group, many of whom were women I'd also become close with. So I didn't think too much of it. My first indication that this wouldn't go well should have been my first proper interaction with her. She called while we were cooking dinner and feigned shock at my existence.
""I'm sorry Shaw, is that a girl in your apartment?!""
""I told you about her. This is Zara"" I waved and said hi. She ignored me and continued her conversation.
""You told me about a girl but I didn't think it was serious. I've heard about a lot of your girls over the years, how was I supposed to know this one would become a regular""
Alex didn't say anything for a moment, the tension building with the obvious jab hanging in the air. All the while I stayed silent. It was his job to handle his friends and I knew that how he handled this moment would set the tone for our future. The confusion etched on his face mirrored my own. I know they'd had conversations about me. From telling her he had someone he wanted her to meet during her next visit, to the calls he'd answer over bluetooth in the car. He always told her when she was on speaker and that I was with him. She'd laugh it off, tell him she'd call back when he wasn't as busy and hang up. All before I ever had a chance to say hello.
""It's as serious as I've ever been and ever will be. Get used to seeing and hearing about her"" The conviction in his voice made my heart melt. I knew I could trust him to protect us but it didn't stop my nerves from being on edge. I brushed her behavior off, Maybe she was nervous, worried I would try and push her out of his life the way so many others had. I turned to look at her and the look on her face stopped me in my tracks but just like that it was gone. A big bright smile replacing it. I brushed it off again.
""It's about time, Bradshaw! I'm so happy for you guys. I can't wait to meet you, Zara!""
Taking a look at Alex I could see the relief on his face. He was happy ""his girls"" would get along. He couldn't wait for us to get together. He didn't yet understand what had just happened. Didn't see the wheels turning in her mind. The pressure behind her eyes growing, the tears she kept at bay. My existence in his life had gone from something she had to get through to something she had to remove. I hadn't seen it either. I told her I couldn't wait to meet her.
And then I backed off. Because the man I loved was telling his friend how much he loved me. And she seemed so happy for him. Maybe the way they included me in their facetime calls after that day made me underestimate her. Maybe the distance between NYC and DC gave me a false sense of security. But really I just trusted him. I was so secure in my relationship and in our love that the idea of another woman coming between us was unimaginable. I was so naive.
......
Seven months ago he proposed. We sat in our new condo surrounded by boxes. Everything was falling into place. The life we talked about building during all nighters at Law school. The future we'd planned was taking shape. I pulled a piece of pizza from the box, doing a dramatic turn and preparing to make my case of extra onion ALWAYS being a requirement on pizza when he dropped down to one knee and pulled out a ring box.
""Alex?"" I couldn't stop the tears if I tried. And I tried, I really did. I wanted to be a cute cryer but I couldn't escape my reality. My ugly cry face could win awards. I'm sure of it.
He cleared his throat and grabbed my knee pulling me closer to him. Running his hand down my calf again he pecked my hip and then settled back looking up at me.
""I actually saw you before you saw me. I don't know if you know that or not. I was watching you, entranced in the way you moved and cataloging every detail I could see for a solid 3 minutes before you looked at me, And I knew as soon as I saw those big brown eyes that I wanted to see them every day for the rest of my life. You stood on that terrace and before you told me your name you had changed the trajectory of my life. Every moment of the last 4 years has only solidified what I knew on day one. I was meant to spend my life with you. Please let me spend my life with you.""
My tears didn't stop but I wrapped my arms around his neck and whispered ""forever"" with a voice that sounded far more sturdy than I thought I could muster. We were getting everything we wanted.
Six and a half months ago Alex answered his phone to a hysterical Heather.
Her boyfriend had cheated on her, the other woman was pregnant and she felt like her life was over. Of course she couldn't stay in New York anymore, she was coming home. We told her we would support her in any way we could. When she asked Alex to fly to NYC and help her drive back with her U-Haul I was understanding. I suggested he take someone with him. But he told me she was embarrassed to tell their other friends the details or ask for anymore help. She was struggling and she needed her best friend.
So I ignored my discomfort and agreed.
When he stayed in New York two days longer than planned I tried to have grace. She was leaving her home of eight years with little notice. Heartbroken and preparing to start over in a town that always considered her an outsider. I took my sister to the dinner reservations he missed. Telling myself this was good practice. As lawyers we would have many nights our plans would be derailed in the future. I would be understanding. It sucked, but life happens. He'd be home soon and we could always make new reservations. We would adapt. Like I said, I was naive.
Then came the first surprise.
""Can you guys believe I snagged an apartment in your building? I saw it in my search and thought, There was no way a place in your building had become available and in my price range. It has to be kismet.""
I didn't want to be a petty person. But I knew without a shadow of a doubt that this wouldn't be a good thing. Moving to the city was one thing. Living in our building was another. It felt like my life was being invaded and I decidedly hated the word kismet. Maybe the elevator would break and she wouldn't want to make the trek from the third floor to the thirteenth too often. I should have known that was just the beginning of the Heather and Alexander show.
I think losing him would have been easier if he had physically left me. If Heather had returned, he'd realized she was the love of his life and he was sorry but he needed to let me go. If he didn't love me anymore. That would be easier for me. Black and white and wrapped in a neat little bow. We were together and then we weren't. I could have accepted that without losing myself in the process. Instead the slow unraveling of our relationship felt like torture. My relationship existed in purgatory and I couldn't see a way out. Heather very quickly stopped feeling like a potential friend and more like a storm cloud hanging over my relationship.
The heartbreak was cumulative. With every late night convo that just couldn't wait. Every early morning knock at our door. Every time he prioritized her feelings over my boundaries. Each incident created a new crack in what we'd built together. Until it didn't resemble a relationship anymore. Until I didn't recognize myself anymore.",1,1760204769.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

\*In cafe's and coffee shops it is common that there will be some sort of basket to place your day bag, large purse, or small backpack in at your table rather than setting them on the floor. I tuned into this after staff came over to get my attention, picked up my bag, and placed it in one. A reminder that one is in another country and its a nice idea actually.

\*Watch for bicyclists on sidewalks near stations. They may come flying past and if you are suddenly taking big random steps left or right the outcome could be bad. Speaking of bikes, if you are traveling with your own you cannot wheel it on the subway system as in many places in the west.

\*Tune into how Japanese use shared public spaces. I've seen two or three tourists cluelessly block sidewalks or subway station passageways used by hundred of people. Walking multiple people abreast on sidewalks is also bad. There are spots where the number of people per square mile or kilometer is indeed mind blowing. 

\*Train etiquette. Use quiet indoor voices on trains as not disturbing shared public space is a big cultural reality in Japan and do not place your bag on an empty seat next to you. Queue up on subway and train station platforms neatly as the Japanese do. Train etiquette cannot be overstated in importance so learn about it. Google Maps Directions will indeed tell you everything you need to know to taking the subway to a destination. Just follow it.

\*Otashi. In many restaurants there is a small table charge for eating there and generally a small appetizer item will be provided with that. It is not ""something I didn't order"" and is a norm in Japan. Don't create a big scene about it like some have. Also remember, especially Americans, there is no tipping in either restaurants or taxis so don't. Just don't.

\*Don't forget to check out official tourism information websites and once in Japan, the offices. They contain many useful details and unlike social media they are official. In Kyoto the tourism office at the JR station was able to get me the one remaining seat at a cultural performance during my stay.

\*Do be prepared to carry your wrappers and other minor trash in a plastic bag back to your hotel to dispose of. Its a norm there. Do not litter. Restrooms do not generally have trash bins or paper towels and soap. So bring hand sanitizer. 

\*If you want to tune into how people dress, Uniqlo is a good guide for this. Neutral and dark colors are normal in Japan. Remember clothing sizes are smaller there so you may be disappointed on a massive haul goal, I never found tennis shoes/trainers in my size. I shopped at Uniqlo in the US for my sizes before going. Also, don't over pack. Its more of a headache than it is worth. I've used multiple shirts from outdoor clothing shops that I can wash in the shower and they dry overnight.

\*Be considerate in hotel hallways and don't use your loud voice. Please don't throw items in your room if you have other rooms below you. 

\*Don't rely too heavily on social media in trip planning and don't take Instagram and TikTok very seriously. TikTok Japan and real Japan are two different places. Learn some thing about the culture and the norms and your trip will have more meaning. Don't make people miserable with your drive for Instagram photos. The people of the world are not our personal theme park.

\*Be willing to be a bit flexible with your schedule if the walking wears you out more than expected or you feel overwhelmed by being in a different country and culture. In years of travel there were always things I didn't make it to but had great trips. Plenty of things I was able to circle back to though by not trying to fill every minute in my trip planning.

Have a good trip and compile all the info you can. Maybe even be nice and say hello back to another traveler if they try to greet you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Barndominiums are rapidly gaining popularity among homebuyers looking for unique and functional living spaces. A 3 bed 2 bath barndominium offers an exciting mix of rustic charm and modern convenience. With various floor plans available, it's easy to find one that fits your lifestyle and preferences.

The allure of barndominiums lies in their adaptability. Whether you want an open-concept layout or distinct rooms for privacy, you have options. Here are some key features often found in 3 bed 2 bath barndominium floor plans:

- **Open-Concept Living Space:** Many designs highlight an open living area that combines the kitchen, dining, and living room. This layout is perfect for family gatherings and entertaining guests, offering a spacious feel and seamless flow between rooms.
- **Efficient Kitchen Layout:** A well-designed kitchen often includes an island or a breakfast bar, which maximizes counter space and provides a casual dining option. Ample storage and modern appliances can elevate your cooking experience.
- **Private Bedrooms:** The three bedrooms can be arranged in several ways‚Äîsome plans place them together for a cozy family feel, while others allow for separation for more privacy. Consider the layout that suits family dynamics best.
- **Functional Bathrooms:** With two bathrooms, it‚Äôs easy for families to manage busy mornings. Placing the master bath en suite provides privacy, while a second bath serves the other bedrooms, ensuring convenience for everyone.
- **Outdoor Access:** Many floor plans feature back decks or porches, blending indoor living with outdoor relaxation‚Äîideal for enjoying nature and fostering a connection with the outdoors.

As you explore various layouts, think about how you‚Äôll use each space. One popular model showcases a split-bedroom design, where the master suite is positioned on one side and the other two bedrooms are on the opposite end. This configuration promotes privacy and is perfect for families with older children or guests. The master suite often includes a walk-in closet and en suite bathroom, making it a private retreat for homeowners.

Another exciting option is the addition of a dedicated office space. Many barndominiums incorporate flex rooms allowing you to create an office, hobby area, or extra guest quarters. This versatility is invaluable in today‚Äôs remote working environment, as it helps create a quiet, productive space away from the main living areas.

Consider incorporating energy-efficient elements in your barndominium. High-quality insulation, energy-efficient windows, and solar panels can significantly reduce your utility bills while providing comfort year-round. Many modern barndominium plans include green building materials, allowing you to build a sustainable home while maintaining aesthetic appeal.

Outdoor living is essential in barndominium design. Sliding glass doors leading to a deck can extend your living space outdoors, offering an excellent area for barbecues or morning coffee. Covered patios provide shelter from the sun and rain, ensuring you can enjoy your outdoor space in various weather conditions.

When considering your barndominium, thinking outside the box is vital. Customizing your space to reflect your style can transform a basic floor plan into a dream home. For example, exposed beams and large windows can add character and let in natural light, making your home feel airy and welcoming.

As you evaluate 3 bed 2 bath barndominium floor plans, remember that your unique needs should guide your choice. Whether you prioritize family interaction in an open layout or seek a peaceful retreat in a split-bedroom design, there‚Äôs a perfect floor plan waiting for you.

By carefully considering your lifestyle and preferences, you can craft a living space in a barndominium that is not only functional but also a true reflection of who you are. Embrace the charm and versatility of barndominiums to create a home that you and your family will love for years to come.

The wide range of 3 bed 2 bath barndominium floor plans allows for customization and suits various preferences while emphasizing comfort and style. From open layouts to private retreats, these homes combine practicality with aesthetics, making them an excellent choice for modern living.

Key Considerations When Designing Your Ideal Barndominium Layout
----------------------------------------------------------------

Designing your ideal barndominium layout can be an exciting yet daunting task. A barndominium, often characterized by its barn-like structure and modern amenities, offers a unique blend of rustic charm and contemporary living. To ensure your design meets your needs perfectly, consider several key factors when crafting your layout.

### Understanding Your Space Requirements

First, you need to assess how much space you actually need. Think about your daily activities and lifestyle. Here are some considerations:

- **Family Size:** More bedrooms may be necessary if you have a larger family or frequently host guests.
- **Work from Home:** If you plan to work remotely, incorporating a dedicated office or workspace is essential.
- **Hobbies and Interests:** Factor in areas for hobbies, like a workshop or crafting space.

By identifying your specific space requirements early, you can avoid costly changes later in the process.

### Flow and Functionality

Once you understand your space needs, think about how the areas will flow together. The layout should promote ease of movement and functionality. Consider the following:

- **Open Concept Living:** This design can make your space feel larger and more connected. Open layouts are popular for kitchens and living areas.
- **Traffic Patterns:** Evaluate how people will move through the space. Ensure paths to key areas, like the kitchen and bathrooms, are clear and unobstructed.
- **Separate Zones:** Create distinct areas for work, relaxation, and entertainment to help maintain order in your daily life.

### Natural Light and Ventilation

Lighting plays a crucial role in your barndominium. Properly placed windows and doors can enhance the ambiance while making the space more inviting. Here are some tips:

- **Maximize Windows:** Larger windows or sliding glass doors can bring in more natural light, reducing your need for artificial lighting during the day.
- **Cross-Ventilation:** Strategically position windows to allow for airflow, keeping the home comfortable throughout the seasons.

These elements can significantly enhance your living experience.

### Storage Solutions

A well-planned barndominium layout includes smart storage solutions. Ample storage can help keep your space tidy and functional. Consider these options:

- **Built-In Cabinets:** Use custom cabinetry to maximize space without cluttering the rooms.
- **Multi-Functional Furniture:** Look for furnishings that offer storage solutions, like ottomans or beds with drawers.
- **Pantry Space:** If you love cooking, incorporate a pantry to store supplies easily.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Don‚Äôt forget about your outdoor area! A barndominium often has ample land, so take advantage of it by designing it into your living space. Think about:

- **Decks and Patios:** Create a space for gathering outdoors to barbecue or entertain friends.
- **Gardens:** Consider implementing a garden area for landscaping or vegetable growth.
- **Outdoor Recreation:** If space allows, include recreational spots for activities like cornhole or fire pits.

### Building Codes and Regulations

Before finalizing any design, familiarize yourself with local building codes and regulations. It‚Äôs essential to ensure your layout complies with local zoning laws. This step might include:

- **Setback Requirements:** Check how far from property lines you can build.
- **Permitting:** Secure any necessary permits before construction begins.

Addressing these codes upfront can save you headaches later in the process.

Designing your barndominium layout is about more than just aesthetics; it involves careful consideration of functionality, space, and local necessities. By addressing these key areas, you can create a living space that truly meets your needs and style preferences.

### Conclusion

When it comes to finding the perfect 3 Bed 2 Bath Barndominium floor plan, the options are diverse and exciting. These unique homes blend rustic charm with modern amenities, offering a multitude of layouts to suit various lifestyles. Whether you prefer an open concept for entertaining or a more traditional design that eloquently defines spaces, there‚Äôs a barndominium that can meet your needs.

As you embark on this design journey, it's essential to consider the specific requirements of your family and daily life. Think about how you want to utilize your space. Do you need a large kitchen for family gatherings, or perhaps a cozy nook for reading? Attention to detail can significantly impact the livability of your home, so take the time to assess factors like natural lighting, storage options, and outdoor accessibility.

Flexibility is key in barndominium designs; many plans can be tailored to reflect your personal style and preferences. Embrace the creativity that this building style offers, allowing you to create a warm, inviting environment that feels like home.

Ultimately, a careful blend of aesthetics and functionality will lead to a layout that not only meets your immediate needs but also supports your lifestyle for years to come. As you explore various 3 Bed 2 Bath Barndominium floor plans, remember that the right choice can enhance your living experience and align with your aspirations for modern living.

We saw some feedback about SLCmeetups being ‚Äúcliquish,‚Äù ‚Äúnot truly platonic,‚Äù or ‚Äútoo focused on drinking,‚Äù and we wanted to clarify a few things.

SLCmeetups has always been a mixed community, different hosts plan different styles of events. Some meetups happen at bars or concerts, while others are coffee hangouts, dinners, hikes, or game nights. The goal isn‚Äôt to push one type of culture, but to make space for people to connect however they‚Äôre comfortable.

You don‚Äôt have to drink (or not drink) to belong here. You don‚Äôt have to be religious, spiritual, or anything specific either, this community is about real connection, not conformity.

As for the ‚Äústrictly platonic‚Äù part: yes, that‚Äôs what this group is built on, and our rules and guidelines reflect that. However, we also recognize that we can‚Äôt control people‚Äôs individual intentions or what happens outside our events or off the server.

What matters is that we‚Äôre not promoting anything romantic or sexual in this space and that‚Äôs where our sister server, SLCmeetups+Date, comes in. That community exists specifically for people who want to explore dating or chemistry in a more intentional, adult way.

Regarding ‚Äúcliquishness,‚Äù it‚Äôs something that can happen naturally as friendships form especially among regulars who‚Äôve been showing up for a while. But our hosts and mods always encourage new people to jump in, introduce themselves, and even host their own meetups.

We take feedback seriously and always aim to make this community inclusive, respectful, and authentic because at the end of the day, SLCmeetups is about connection",3,1760204566.0,SLCmeetups,0,0.8,False
1o41thv,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1o41thv/i_used_to_rehearse_conversations_in_my_head_for/,I used to rehearse conversations in my head for hours before texting back,"Three years ago, I would literally write out text messages in my notes app, delete them, rewrite them, and sometimes never send them at all. I'd spend 2 hours crafting a response to ""how was your day?"" because I was terrified of saying something boring or wrong.

The breaking point came when I matched with someone on a dating app who seemed perfect for me. We had amazing conversations about books, similar life philosophies, everything clicked. But I was so afraid of ruining it with a bad text that I took 3 days to respond to her asking if I wanted to meet for coffee.

By the time I finally sent ""Yes, I'd love to! Sorry for the delayed response,"" she had already lost interest. She replied politely but the energy was gone. I realized my fear of saying the wrong thing was actually guaranteeing I'd lose the connections I wanted most.

That's when I started studying why some conversations flow naturally while others die out. I noticed that people who were good at texting weren't necessarily more clever or interesting they were just more authentic and consistent.

They responded with genuine curiosity instead of trying to craft the ""perfect"" message. I started practicing something I called ""interested over impressive."" Instead of trying to be witty, I'd simply ask follow-up questions about things they mentioned. Instead of crafting elaborate responses, I'd share honest reactions to what they told me.

The shift was incredible. Conversations started lasting weeks instead of days. People began telling me I was ""easy to talk to"" and ""a great listener."" The anxiety around texting didn't disappear overnight, but it became manageable because I had a framework that felt authentic.

**Day 3: Chania, Crete - The Charm of Old Town and a Night of Gods and Goddesses**

The third morning of our Desire Cruise brought us to the beautiful port of Chania on the island of Crete. The sun rose over the Venetian harbor, painting the pastel-colored buildings in soft morning light. This stop felt like stepping into a living postcard filled with centuries of stories.

We started the day wandering through the narrow streets of the Old Town, where bougainvillea spilled over stone walls and caf√©s served Greek coffee with views of the sea. Many of us lingered near the old mosque and lighthouse before heading off on excursions. Some explored the ruins of Aptera and its ancient fortress, while others chose wine tastings, monastery visits, or lazy swims in the translucent waters near Stavros Bay. The scent of grilled octopus, baked feta, and olive oil seemed to follow us everywhere. Chania was as charming as it promised, a perfect mix of history, sun, and salt air.

Back onboard the Marina, the afternoon rolled into a series of sensual and playful workshops that have become the hallmark of a Desire sailing. Amber led her Erotic Massage and Sensual Skills session, teaching couples how to build slow anticipation and connection through touch. Dr. Jess followed with her talk on The Ultimate Full Body Pleasure for Her, a powerful and empowering session that had everyone smiling and blushing by the end.

At 4 pm, guests of [TSC-Cruises.com](http://TSC-Cruises.com) gathered for our private open bar meet & greet in Toscana Restaurant. The energy was vibrant, the cocktails perfectly chilled, and it was wonderful to reconnect with friends new and old. From there, our group made its way to the grand staircase for ‚ÄúThe Gathering of the Muses‚Äù - an impromptu toga-themed photo shoot that turned into a joyful, laughter-filled moment of pure community. Seeing everyone dressed in flowing white and gold felt like a living tribute to the Greek gods.

As the ship sailed away from Crete, music from the pool deck blended with the glow of the sunset. Later that night, the Marina Lounge transformed for *House of Scoundrel*, a sultry cabaret of burlesque and fantasy that blurred the line between art and seduction. The night ended in full Desire style with the *Toga Party* in Horizons, where DJ Mauro kept the dance floor alive until the early hours. It was a celebration of pleasure, laughter, and connection that reminded us exactly why we came on this voyage.

Tomorrow we sail toward the island of Cephalonia - but tonight, Chania will linger in our memories as the place where the mythic and the modern met under the Cretan moon.

1st image: 
I'm being told ""this is just a stain"". I do not feel this is staining, I think it is a leaky filling. The filling is ~20 yrs old for a decent cavity. Last yr, the dentist did a tiny grinding adjustment in this spot (I had a filling in the tooth behind it, and my bite felt funny) This color change started to happen after that, coincidentally. 

2nd image: 
Told ""this is just part of your tooths anatomy"". With the hole being in that location, I'm concerned because I had some decay filled on the other side's same tooth, in that same spot. 
It may be because I've started paying so much attention to my teeth after the perio diagnosis, but I really don't remember seeing that there, years ago..

I'm new to the subreddit and thought I would post a progress report.  I started DS on August 10, 2025.  I had done Duolingo for nine months and I gave myself 150 hours for that. Plus I grew up in San Antonio, Texas and had a lot of passive exposure to Spanish, so there's a lot of words that I just know.  

At 300 hours I am pretty much where the roadmap says I should be.  I can understand native speakers quite well as long as they speak a bit slower.  Over the last month I gradually stopped watching beginner videos and now I am only watching intermediate.  I also listen to the DS podcasts when I am driving or walking the dog.  

For a while I was listening to the Simple Stories in Spanish podcast.  The woman who does this podcast is a Spanish teacher so she has very good grammar, but she is not a native speaker.  I know at some point in the future I will be speaking Spanish and a Minnesota accent will come out, but oh well.  I really liked her original stories and she's just a really nice person.  I stopped listening to her once I could follow the intermediate DS podcasts.  

The other day I was watching Andrea's Youtube channel just for a bit of variety and accidentally clicked on an advanced video.  She was speaking to Spanish speakers about how she learned English.  She sounded like she was speaking at a natural RAPID pace in Mexican Spanish and I was surprised that I was able to comprehend somewhere between 50 to 75% of what she was saying.  

My goal is to consume 2 1/2 hours of Spanish comprehensible input every day and I'm keeping up with it so far.  I am avoiding speaking but I do occasionally imagine how I would say something in Spanish.  I recently met a woman from Spain and I'm excited to have coffee with her next week and listen to a native speaker in person.  I am also looking forward to reading books in Spanish when I get to 600 hours or so.  

I am also doing about half an hour a day of French comprehensible input.  Estoy aprendiendo espa√±ol y frances al mismo tiempo porque soy loco.  Gracias.  ",8,1760204175.0,dreamingspanish,0,1.0,False

I'm also gluten and lactose free. I also take mental health meds for anxiety and depression, so I can't really drink coffee or even tea gave me bad anxiety the other day. Decaf tea.


My fatigue has been so bad lately. Worse than usual. Like we went to Target yesterday and today and I felt like I could barely stand and walk. It's weird because it's like systemic fatigue, but I'm still physically strong and have a good amount of muscle. I've tried pacing with exercise and even took a week off and it was there.

I read in a book a year or so ago about D-Ribose and how it's good for CFS. I remember it helping but forget why I stopped taking it. I remember seeing a post on the CFS sub that it can cause dementia or something. But the doses they used in mice were quite high... I just started taking it again and it seems to help. Has anyone taken is long term? From what I've read it's naturally occurring in the body, so I feel like in proper dosages and frequency it shouldn't be an issue. Like creatine.

**Chapter 1 ‚Äî The Joke That Started It All:**

¬†

Gloria in late December had the feeling of a country holding its breath. The skyline that once pulsed with traffic and laughter now looked bruised ‚Äî checkpoints at intersections, banners in another language, armored vehicles rolling slow like they were testing the patience of the whole city.

Sometimes, when I passed through the central boulevard, I still remembered how it used to sound ‚Äî vendors shouting over the hum of buses, the smell of roasted peanuts and rain-washed asphalt. Now the same street was silent except for the hum of engines and the occasional barked order through a megaphone.

Rain hadn‚Äôt fallen for weeks, but the air was heavy, as if the sky itself mourned.

I sat on the living-room couch with a closed engineering textbook on my knee. Civil engineering was my course; the drawings and formulas were what I came back to night after night because they were a map of future certainties. I had a plan, or wanted one ‚Äî to leave a name behind. Not a fleeting mark, but a legacy. I wanted to build something that would make the world remember me long after I was gone.

My cousin Raikou lay on the floor across from me. Two years younger, always quicker to laugh, always restless in a way that made me both proud and uneasy. He was flipping a coin ‚Äî the same tarnished coin he‚Äôd carried since childhood ‚Äî catching it with the same rhythm every time. He once said it brought him luck. Lately, I think he just liked having control over something that still obeyed his hand.

‚ÄúImagine not waking up here anymore,‚Äù he said without looking up. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ gone. A proper escape.‚Äù

He spoke quietly, but the sentence landed like a decision. The occupation had hardened into a daily reality ‚Äî public radio announcing curfews, foreign troops patrolling markets, and every small freedom measured against a new rule. Saying the word¬†*leave*¬†was no longer theater; it was survival.

I told him it was reckless. I told him the obvious things: the coast was watched, the borders were closed, the harbor was a line of metal teeth. But when Raikou fixed me with his usual impatient half-smile, I heard in his voice a resolve I couldn‚Äôt ignore.

‚ÄúWe either live our lives under someone else‚Äôs orders,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúor we find a way the occupiers didn‚Äôt expect.‚Äù

The laugh that rose between us was thin ‚Äî not humor, but defiance. The kind of laugh that acknowledges danger and chooses it anyway.

For weeks, the idea became a private code. We catalogued possibilities ‚Äî boats we might find, unguarded routes, familiar faces in the market who might help if we dared to ask. People said the ports were sealed. People lied for comfort. We listened and filed every contradiction like a list of exits.

One night in March, at a small internet caf√© run by Mr. Aymen ‚Äî a man who brewed coffee strong enough to mask despair ‚Äî Raikou and I sat beneath a flickering screen. The television looped the same images: barricades, foreign officers, the same city learning to speak less each day.

‚ÄúYou hear about the convoy?‚Äù Mr. Aymen muttered to a customer, too loudly for the room. ‚ÄúThey move at night now. They move like they own the dark.‚Äù

Raikou leaned closer. ‚ÄúThere are gaps,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúGaps that close, but only sometimes. A person who knows how to wait sees them.‚Äù

I nodded. Waiting, measuring, precision ‚Äî the tools of an engineer. And perhaps, of an escape.

By May, the idea had stopped being a joke. Raikou had been saving for weeks ‚Äî folded bills in an old tin, coins tucked in his shoes. He spoke less, smiled less. The restlessness in him had turned into direction.

One morning, I woke to find him already dressed, bag in hand. His coin rested on the table ‚Äî as if luck was no longer needed.

‚ÄúYou coming?‚Äù he asked.

No speech. No plea. Just the quiet certainty that if I said no, we would never meet again.

That night, the coast was a black line beneath a darker sky. Twelve faces met us there ‚Äî strangers with the same tired determination. A single patched boat waited, stripped of everything but purpose. There were no flags, no papers; only the resolve of those who refused to be counted.

I looked at the sea and felt how small we were. The water stretched out like an unspoken history, swallowing names too heavy to carry.

‚ÄúAre you afraid?‚Äù I asked Raikou.

He shrugged. ‚ÄúEverything we had is gone. This is the unwritten map.‚Äù

We stepped onto the boat together.

When the oars dipped into the water, the coast began to fade. The city shrank behind us, its dim lights trembling like memories that didn‚Äôt want to die. We had not chosen adventure. We had chosen necessity.

The motor growled, then softened to a hum. For hours, we drifted through darkness thick enough to erase direction. The air grew colder, metallic. Prayers filled the silence, whispered by lips that knew no more of faith than of geography.

Then, the engine began to choke.

The old guide ‚Äî a man whose name none of us ever learned ‚Äî raised a hand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here,‚Äù he said.

No one spoke.

Fog rolled in, silver and slow, swallowing everything in reach. There was no coastline. No horizon. Only the sound of our breath and the lapping of water that felt too still, too deliberate.

Raikou leaned forward. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean‚Ä¶¬†*here*?‚Äù

The guide didn‚Äôt blink. ‚ÄúThe place you were meant to reach,‚Äù he said. His voice carried no emotion ‚Äî only finality.

He turned off the engine. The boat drifted.

The air smelled of iron and rain that never fell.

I felt the weight of my ambition then ‚Äî all the structures I had wanted to build, the name I hoped to leave behind ‚Äî and wondered if I had just stepped into a kind of history no one ever returns from.

Raikou met my gaze. ‚ÄúIs this‚Ä¶ the other side?‚Äù

Before I could answer, the fog moved ‚Äî not like mist, but like something alive, drawing itself apart.

And that‚Äôs when I realized:

Raise the sails because we're on a journey to the past where the fashion tides are turning, turning all the way back to the good ol' days where people actually dressed up, not just to pick up their coffee. üöÄüï∞

*Legend has it,* what's old is new again:

- Bell-bottoms are no longer just for your off-beat uncle. They are strutting their way into our hearts and closets, probably plotting to outshine our skinny jeans. Watch out; they're wider than my desire to collect antique compasses!

*Speaking of things with ""bell"" in the name,* let's not ignore the ding-dong of the bell sleeves. They're fluttering back into the scene, flapping in the breeze like the flags of fashion's history. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

- And what's this? Plaid making the rounds? Thank goodness, because I was beginning to wonder if we could only make pixel patterns on screens. Now it's a 3D reality once again, tartan-up our lives.

*Embroidery?* Absolutely treasure-ific! Every stitch tells a story, and these days, it seems we're flipping the pages back to chapters filled with intricately adorned fabrics. Your denim jacket is just begging for that personal touch, something as unique as a map leading to your individuality's trove.

- Cannot be forgetting those brooches‚Äîshiny little tokens of personal flair! They‚Äôre making a sparkling comeback, not just on your granny‚Äôs Sunday best but on the jackets and bags of trendy folk who want to pin a little piece of splendor onto their everyday gear.

Let's not walk off the plank without mentioning the comeback czar: *Vintage tees!* Worn artistically under a blazer, they scream low-effort chic louder than a drunken seagull at a beach picnic.

- Ah, and the coordinates for footwear? Straight to platform shoes! Who wouldn't want to be a couple of inches closer to the crow's nest without actually climbing? A precarious balance between height and comfort, granted, but oh, what a view!

Now, before ye weigh anchor and set off pillaging through your ancestors' wardrobes, remember that style isn't about when. It's about _wear._ Wear it with confidence; wear it with pride. Whether it's from 1920 or 2020, it's not about the age‚Äîit's about the attitude. 

Happy style-sailing, you chic capitans and capitanas! Drop anchor in the comments and share your favorite throwback threads! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüßµüëóüëñ‚ú®",1,1760203406.0,FashionFuture,0,1.0,False

**Story so far:**

* The PLT recruit Onyx Hearthviper, a tatuaran ex-mercenary with the ability to generate a phalanx and her cat-sized gecko familiar named Allium.
* With many of Onyx‚Äôs equipment turned in after her resignation, Philia and Arek decide to supplement her previous weapons with technology to bypass its inability to properly muster mechanical weapons i.e. crossbows.

**Interlude 3.4B**

**Hardhorn Spire (Part 2)**

**\_\_\_**

‚ÄúThis is some strong thick wood.‚Äù Kvaris remarked as she opened the door. It was unlocked.

‚Äú*Thank you!*‚Äù Zefir said cryptically while the earthlings were laughing at some private joke.

Kvaris entered the tower. There were no signs of a struggle. All the furniture was untouched. Lived in, but in no way damaged. There was dust but not much. Dried muddy tracks disappeared into a rug that could use a wash but was in no way ratty. A grand hearth nestled opposite the door, with sand poured over the logs. Above, legs of ham, salted fish, and sausages hung on hooks from the rafters, giving off just the right scent of salt and curing meat without a hint of decay whatsoever. Root crops like potatoes nestled on wooden shelves with none of them having any mold or rot.

‚Äú*Do those smell fresh to you?*‚Äù Ingrid inquired as Sully dumped in more chilis into the work.

‚ÄúSeems so‚Ä¶‚Äù Kvaris said, ‚ÄúTo be honest, I think some of these need another week to ripen. These are all relatively fresh. I‚Äôll tell you another thing I smell‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like a cabin by the sea here. I smell the sea salt spray permeating everywhere along with coastal pine.‚Äù

She turned her attention to a small pyramid of casks resting atop another shelf. Burnt on the facing side was the familiar heraldry of a jodove dramatically holding up a tankard, his head crowned in a floral wreath of the hops used to flavor the ale.

Kvaris smiled, recognizing the brewery. ""The Pinnacle, that's some good taste.""

""*I'm coming over now.*"" Siria said, barely containing her excitement.

‚Äú*That tells me a lot.*‚Äù Ingrid giggled as she saw the elf hurrying over.

‚Äú*Bring a cask over to Ser Kevain.*‚Äù Philia said. ‚Äú*Make it two, that should help us squeeze more gold out of him.*‚Äù

\_\_\_

""Anubis just went inside."" Ingrid sighed, ""I know I'm the last to say this, but that's reckless.""

""Kitty-Five's identification scroll states that this tower's original location is at the very remote Keelhaul Atoll. So-called due to the island surrounded by treacherous rocks and reefs that shred ships."" Neith explained, ""You'll have a better chance docking the Gerald Ford on Nauru.""

""That explains her remark about the tower smelling like a coastal cabin..but still..."" Ingrid began, ‚Ä¶we don't have to worry about big bad monsters on Earth. Well, at least not the ones imported from outer space. And if that island is so unreachable, then who's to say every high tide some Godzilla comes over and basks on that island?""

The Aquila hovered up and down the tower, scanning the stone.

""Factoring the limestone composition of these blocks and the erosion patterns..."" Neith said, her cameras whirring as she examined the tower, ""I would estimate the age to be at least 400 years. The scratches on the wooden door are inconclusive, but if there were hostile entities on that island then that door alone was sufficient to thwart them.""

""What about climbing the tower?""

""Inconclusive"" Neith scanned the tower walls. ""The growth of moss and lichen on the upper walls render climbing unfeasible. The growth seems undisturbed, with no streaks of new contrasting with more established colonies. If anything attempted to climb here, it was a long, long time ago‚Ä¶""

‚Äú*At the very least‚Ä¶*‚Äù Siria said, stepping into the tower. ‚Äú*Whatever dangers lurk on Keelhaul Island have been stopped by the door.*‚Äù

\_\_\_

**Jordi‚Äôs Dismantling House:**

""I'm on the second floor..."" Kvaris said. ‚ÄúLooks like the sleeping quarters. Beds arranged in a circle around a central hearth. Arrow slits along the wall. ‚Äú

Her nose didn‚Äôt pick up the scent of mold or mildew, only the faint scent of sea-spray that came in when the breeze blew in from the loopholes.

‚ÄúThe beds aren‚Äôt exactly well-kept, but they're far from slovenly. Opening the windows now‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre thick solid slabs of wood . Swings inwards. Each has a steel latch to secure them. Steel plating on the outside, painted black‚Ä¶ windows themselves are rather small.‚Äù

She walked around the room, activating the fairy lights as she did.

‚ÄúDouble-decked bunks. Each has a chest at the foot‚Ä¶ opening one right now‚Ä¶just clothes and personal effects.‚Äù

""We can sort those out later in Autumnhollow."" Siria said from below, helping herself to a cup of Pinnacle. ""At the very least, the tower itself seems rather secure. What do you think, Kvaris?""

‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs lurking here so far‚Ä¶‚Äù Kvaris replied, sniffing around. ‚ÄúThe trapdoors leading to the floors above are lockable from above only. And...""

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs murder holes on the ceiling‚Ä¶‚Äù Siria observed dully, looking up.

Climbing up the second floor, she saw Kvaris just about to head up to the third. The garm pushed the trapdoor. While it had some weight, it opened.

""It's a bit of everything‚Ä¶‚Äù she said, looking around, ‚Äú...bookshelves, storage, a parlor... like this floor, each loophole has at least two quivers of arrows and a bow.""

Kvaris picked one up and gave it a pull, its draw weight was good and heavy. The weapons on racks while not fresh off of the anvil, all had their blades sharpened well. She hefted the axes and swords, finding them all well-balanced.

""Found some good weapons for our villagers. This place is well-equipped to stave off a siege.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed‚Ä¶‚Äù Siria murmured as she unrolled scrolls from a rack. ‚ÄúScrolls of fireball, restoration..‚Äù

‚ÄúBread and cheese too‚Ä¶‚Äù Kvaris said, opening up a barrel. ‚ÄúTwice-baked cakes and smoked cheese‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú*They‚Äôve set up redundancies in case they have to head upstairs quickly*.‚Äù Neith remarked.

Another barrel revealed itself to be filled with water, with a blessed stone sending bubbles floating up to the surface.

‚ÄúBare necessities to survive a prolonged siege in case they breached the door‚Ä¶‚Äù Kvaris remarked.

\_\_\_

**Farmer Grace‚Äôs House, Kansas, Earth:**

Arek resembled, to an earthling‚Äôs eyes, an upright walking shrimp. Two-thirds of his body stood upright, while the rest scuttled along the ground on six legs. Like how a bird‚Äôs feet naturally grasp when at rest, allowing them to sleep perched, a gulan‚Äôs back naturally arches backwards, having evolved to maintain their posture.

He sat on a chair made for his species, resembling a squat chair with a very tall back. He sat on this chair ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù, allowing him to relax by leaning forward into it. He had four arms, and like his back, were naturally crossed at rest. These rested atop his chair‚Äôs rest while his primary pair of arms rested atop his desk as he watched the Whales.

He drew from his mug of coffee, his mandibles clicking repeatedly in pleasure as he enjoyed the Earth-grown beans brewed according to the planet‚Äôs methods. Earthlings had told him that his favorite brand of coffee was nothing special, but as a gulan proverb goes; the neighbor‚Äôs sheep always tend to look fatter than your own. His mind raced for the terran equivalent, but failed to grasp the exact words.

‚Äú*What was it again?*‚Äù Arek thought ‚Äú*The trees always look taller? Or was it the fruit?*‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think of that dick tower, Kaguya?‚Äù he inquired with a snicker.

‚ÄúLike a mammalian penis, it sure is girthier on the inside.‚Äù the AI joked, before returning to a slightly more serious tone. ‚ÄúThe tac-cams of Siria and Kvaris showed dimensions much more spacious compared to Neith‚Äôs exterior scans, This allows the tower to have so many loopholes to shoot through.‚Äù

‚ÄúA perfect place to bunker up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI would say, hard cover.‚Äù

Arek was snickering.

‚ÄúThe door is a weakspot.‚Äù He said after some silence. ""What would you recommend to replace it with?""

""I would say they needed reinforced doors last week. Go local. Chobham composite plating. Quicker to source, tougher than steel, and lighter.""

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll send the requisition.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo that.‚Äù Arek said, taking another sip of coffee. ‚ÄúWhat else?""

""The crenellations are sloped at a steep angle, allowing for defenders to shoot lower. The merlons have loopholes..."" Kaguya said as she showed Kvari's feed as she walked along the upper deck.

Through the Aquila drone's cams, Kaguya commandeered one of the cameras and aimed high, showing that there was barely an inch of clearance from the top of the tower's pointy roof and the ceiling.

Back in Kvaris' cams, she saw a line of trap doors along the edge. Her sense of direction told her that these were along the overhang. She lifted one of the trap doors, revealing a sheer drop below, serving as either a machicolation or a way to rappel down.

""We already have a problem here. ""Arek observed. ""Our mice aren't tall enough to peek over the parapet...""

""That is a simple issue."" Kaguya showed a still from Kvaris' footage showing the parapet, crenels, and merlons. It took her a few minutes to generate a 3D render. From this diorama, she generated a wooden platform.

""These will give the mice clearance to shoot over the parapet."" Kaguya explained. The width of the wood platform extended a little into the merlons, halfway before it angled outwards into a loophole.

Meanwhile Kvaris looked up. showing the conical interior of the roof.

""A possible loft can be built there for storage."" Arek suggested. ""Or gunports in the unlikely event one needs to deal with an airforce.""

""RPG inadvisable. Recommendation: Javelin missiles to be stored at the top of the tower."" Kaguya said.

Arek shrugged. ""Can do. Colonel Allen owes me a favor.‚Äù

Kvaris was inspecting a small shrub that grew on a big ornamental pot. It was situated in the middle of the room and it had glowing runes forming an orbiting marquee.

""A little too big for a bonsai."" Arek said. ""What does it do, I wonder? Also, this seems to suggest the owners weren't dead for very long... is it?""

""Anubis, please walk around the little tree."" Kaguya instructed.

""It looks healthy, Kaguya."" Kvaris said as she examined the plant for signs of wilting. There were none.

""Inconclusive data, Arek. The placement would probably have provided enough sunshine outside of noon and near-noon hours, especially if this is the highest point in the island. The seaspray, fog and dew in the Keelhaul island might have provided enough moisture."" Kaguya said.

""There's little cherries too."" Kvaris noted, gently whisking aside the branches.

""Guano."" Kaguya said. ""Birds could have helped fertilize this plant, it is in a self-sufficient environment to thrive and grow.""

""I guess we'll just have to wait till Viel comes over."" Arek said. ""Maybe it's just a companion plant...but the magic planter it's in suggests it has a tactical purpose.""

\_\_\_

**Autumnhollow:**

""Glados, how is our little spy drone on the other Earth?"" Ingrid inquired as she plated up the pad-thai noodles. From the screen she could see Kvaris and Siria hurrying back, the Hardhorn already dismissed.

""For the meantime I have the Falcis perched up at one of the trees by the Meyer House."" Neith replied. ""Tomorrow morning, local time, I will start heading to Chicago. Even on an overcast day, Falcis‚Äô solar cells should be enough to power it while flying about. The bad news is, since that Earth is still in the 90s, it's not like I can approach anyone without them panicking. They're already facing a monster invasion, seeing a talking drone decades ahead of their time would probably make them assume it was an alien attack.""

Philia, who had begun chipping away at another crystolith suddenly stopped.

""If you guys think I would be there during a wormhead and avarice invasion..."" Arek's mandibles clickled rapidly in amusement. ""...let's just say I would have gotten Kaguya to high-tail me out of there in a jiffy.""

""Oh, I don't mean that."" Philia said ""I was thinking we could get the Dark Empire to glass the planet.""

Ingrid continued making a new batch, unconcerned.

""Just kidding."" Philia continued, resuming her chiseling. ""Just glass the entire state of Illinois. That should rid that Earth of its monster population.""

""How exactly?"" Ingrid murmured at first. ""Do you plan to like... hijack NASA several hundreds of miles away and prank call the emperor? You weren't even Dark Queen yet.""

""My authorization credentials were just snipped out of Zorkoth's own."" Philia explained.

""Sounds like a guy who'd still be alive if you hadn't dropped him into an alien woodchipper."" Ingrid snickered.

""No,"" Arek said. ""High Marshal Zorkoth is long dead. Around the time of the Seven Nations' War that happened in China. King Fish's credentials were granted to her as a testament to her uhhh... excellent job during her stint as Dark Queen. Very few, and those are at the top of the food chain of the Dark Empire; know Zorkoth's numbers. IF successful, it's highly likely they will take whatever she says seriously.""

""Let's hope then..."" Ingrid said, flipping the noodles and vegetables into the air, ""That their Umikla Hyperspace Relay is just loitering in its usual place like in our own timeline.""

""What's that?"" Selphie asked, entering the house. She headed off to the kitchen to wash her hands before helping with the preparation.

""Think of it as a colossal portal that allows star-faring ships to travel extreme distances instantly."" Ingrid replied ""The Dark Empire has another relay near their homeworld, allowing them to quickly muster their forces across impossible distances. We have a facility on Earth that should be able to send a signal powerful enough to reach the Umikla and make contact.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs like having a portal from the capital of Veles to the Elion-Nosco border?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly Selphie. You got it perfectly.‚Äù

Ingrid smiled as the dryad made cute noises from having her head patted.

‚ÄúPLT, found anything good so far?"" Ingrid asked.

""We've got some good finds."" Peanut said after a moment of silence. ‚ÄúA Xefilos.‚Äù

""Talk to me, Kinoko."" Ingrid said as began cracking eggs to make the golden wrapper for this batch of pad thai. Glancing up, she saw the little mushroom hold up what looked like a hula loop made of what looked like braided silver or platinum. Along the hoop were smaller rings that held up cracked soulstones that constantly fizzled with \[Mana\].

‚ÄúThat hoop looks fine.‚Äù Ingrid said, glancing at the feed. ‚ÄúBut at the state of those soulstones, that‚Äôs just deadweight?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù Peanut squeaked, inspecting the structure of the hoop itself for further damage ‚ÄúThe bad news is that whatever weapons were stored here are now irrevocably lost. The good news is that we can replace them.‚Äù

Peanut let go of the Xefilos, but rather than clatter to the floor, it slowly hovered downwards as if it was in lunar gravity.

""I'm guessing you have no idea what it does, Starchaser?"" The little mushroom smiled.

""Not at all."" Ingrid said as she deftly bundled the noodles, veggies and shrimps up. ""Besides you telling me that it stores weapons in those soulstones. It seems to be a rather awkward way to carry them around...""

Sammy spoke up, she and the wolians were now sparring two-on-one.

""That Xefilos cannot be taken from the owner until they die."" Sammy said over the staccato of furious fencing. ""Which means, whoever that will be gifted to, has to be decided wisely. I'm sure there's some way to undo ownership but it's likely extremely expensive if not outright difficult to find...""

""Once someone has claimed ownership of the Xefilos-"" Amalla panted as she fenced against the Nightmane rider, despite being outnumbered two to one, Tom Foster's issue stood her ground well. ""It assumes an immaterial, spectral form. I know this, because I once had one in my possession. It anchors itself to you like a ghostly raiment, and with a mere thought you can adjust its position-""

""Elevation, yaw and pitch."" Philia's hammer made a melodic \*ting\* as she fractured a huge chunk of crystal. ""It will always remain centered around the wearer and there's some minimum clearance required so you can't have it 'touch' your body, in a manner of speaking.""

""Yes..."" Amalla said, though she didn't really understand what those terms meant. ""From there you can muster any weapon stored with the stones. Like the Xephilos, these weapons can be manipulated in any way, so long as part of the weapon remains in contact with the Xephilos itself.""

""What happens if the enemy grabs and yanks the weapon?"" Ingrid asked as she began washing the wok.

""Then you get pulled as well."" Kaolla said, gasping as she ducked under Sammy's swing. ""However, whoever wields the Xefilos is afforded a great advantage.""

""Do you girls want it?"" Ingrid inquired.

""I would be honored, but the guns you have armed us already suffice."" Kaolla replied ""This is best given to Night-Rider, and I'm not saying this to catch her off-guard and land a free hit.""

""Why not King Fish or Kinoko?"" Sammy proposed. ""They sure could use an extra hand to fend off attackers closing in.""

""King Fish or I may end up accidentally hitting each other,"" Peanut squeaked, ""And I'm in no way skilled enough to imagine such an unconventional way of using a sword or spear.""

""Tempting offer‚Ä¶**da ga, kotowaru!**"" Philia said with dramatic flair. ""Besides the aforementioned reason that Kinoko gave, I already have ways to defend myself against attackers trying to get up close and personal with me.""

""We decline!"" Kinu and Kvaris chorused.

""Sister and I believe we should have the same equipment."" Kinu said as she held out a trident for Viel. The citrilan girl‚Äôs scroll of identification glowed as magic runes appeared all over the weapon, revealing its secrets. ‚ÄúWe do believe that Night-Rider will benefit from this the most, allowing her to‚Ä¶ I believe the word was ‚Äòbulldoze‚Äô through a throng as needed.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt your Tempest Lancers already do that?‚Äù Ingrid asked. ‚ÄúIf I remember correctly, even if it‚Äôs recharging you can just put your own \[Mana\] into it?‚Äù

‚ÄúA few things‚Ä¶‚Äù Viel said as she began reading through the scroll quickly. The glowing glyphs rapidly spread all over the scroll, taking time to solidify into controlled sears that formed words and figures. ‚ÄúThe Tempest Lancers aren‚Äôt that efficient when it comes to using \[Mana\] and its too complicated to calibrate without accidentally losing its abilities. Deregor used a lot of non-standard magic, so nobody really bothers to modify them.‚Äù

Viel paused to quickly finish her reading.

‚ÄúThis trident is known as the \[Cleaving Vanguard\],‚Äù She said, her eyes flicking to the diagrams burned into the scroll. ‚ÄúOn a successful strike, it will use the opponent‚Äôs Mana to create a second, cutting force along its tines. Meaning it‚Äôs simultaneously a trident and a cutting sword.‚Äù

‚ÄúNeat!‚Äù Ingrid exclaimed.

‚ÄúThe width of the cutting attack is equal to that of the length of the haft.‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúAt least this one we can take to an atelier if its length doesn‚Äôt reach parity with the phalanx. The distance the cutting force travels is half the length of the weapon as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat should go to Spartan.‚Äù Kvaris said ‚ÄúAmarok and I already have our brand of magical spears, as does Night-Rider. This weapon is best used for her centermost lancer, that way she can quickly drive a wedge into the enemy formation.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your call, girls.‚Äù Ingrid sad, cleaning up the wok.

‚ÄúGlados, show Starchaser this.‚Äù Siria said. Through the screen, Ingrid saw a torn and blood-stained choker. The soulstone embedded into the center glowed brilliantly as the elf poured her \[Mana\] into it.

‚ÄúThe good news is that you‚Äôre looking at a real gem here, pun intended.‚Äù Siria said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called the Champion Effigy. It shrouds the body in a protective field, taking precedence above all other defenses. It only works when the wearer isn‚Äôt attacking, and it‚Äôs been cleverly crafted such that each time it's active it enhances the user‚Äôs strength for the next strike. The bad news is that this came off the dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù Ingrid said ‚ÄúSlow your attacks and get a strength boost. In exchange it shields you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm familiar with the spellcraft of this artifact.‚Äù Siria said as she took out a knife and began taking off the mangled leather strap. ‚ÄúThe offensive capability was the original design of the Champion Effigy, the defensive capability was an act of serendipity. It was originally meant for the Kistomerxes cavalry elites two thousand years ago. There isn‚Äôt much knowledge left of them, so whatever surviving artifacts they had have yet to be fully accounted for, much less how to make new ones.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds awfully convenient that many of these useful artifacts can‚Äôt be reverse-engineered.‚Äù Ingrid as she waited for the mice to take out the bubbling-hot deep-dish pizza in the oven. She held another pizza in her hands, finished by another set of mice. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs intentional.‚Äù

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù Philia replied as she stepped back and let the troll workers carry off a huge chunk of crystalline shell. ‚ÄúEven magical artifacts today, well at least most of them have self-bricking measures to prevent tampering. Just like how US Javelin missile launchers can‚Äôt be used against our own. Take the Sally Pot for example. They have been stolen, even during its creators‚Äô heyday but all they got were ordinary cooking pots. Jailbroken ones are needles in an Everest-sized haystack. More or less.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill. There‚Äôs a fallacy here.‚Äù Ingrid slid the pizza into the oven. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing that both the Champion Effigy and the Xefilos are going to Night-Rider, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Siria said.

‚ÄúHow is that going to help? What‚Äôs the point of having extra arms, in a manner of speaking, if she‚Äôs gotta attack every two hours?‚Äù Ingrid snickered.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, it would be pointless. However, both items came from the same deceased.‚Äù Siria replied. ‚ÄúThe tiefling. This stands to reason her Xefilos did not violate the conditions of the Effigy charm.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have some Tauven War Drums to go with the Xefilos. Night-Rider would enjoy these.‚Äù Viel said. Ingrid took a look at her phone and saw Viel propping up a pair of kanabo-like clubs. They were made of steel, only as girthy as a baseball bat at its thickest, and had studs all over the long striking head., which was hexagonal rather than round.

‚ÄúSounds like they do more than just turn bones into powder.‚Äù Ingrid said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it do?‚Äù

‚ÄúOn impact, it generates an all-directional shockwave roughly equivalent to the strength of the attack.‚Äù Sammy said over the frenzied clacking of wooden swords. The Nightmane rider was sparring with Amalla and Kaolla somewhere in the Arcane Pasture.

‚ÄúDespite it being a simple club, the spellcraft is well made, so it doesn‚Äôt generate any force that goes toward the wielder. With those in the Xefilos, I can keep knocking back enemies while I perform one concentrated slash after another. I don‚Äôt however, intend to just use only powered concentrated attacks all the time. Even without the Effigy‚Äôs enhancement, the Xefilos will prove useful.‚Äù

""Found a dragon lance."" Kvaris said, holding up an impressive work of art. Its rondel guard was in the shape of a roaring dragon's head, and the shaft a spiraling flame. Runes flickered in and out of existence as Viel got to work identifying it.

""Not bad."" Ingrid said ""Does it breathe fire or something?""

""You wish."" Philia said, chipping off another shell. ""Less about dragon fire and more like hitting as if a dragon drop kicked you. Cavalry using them are like our world's A-10 GAU avenger cannons. Even if a horse was on a leisurely trot it would go through a car door like its tissue paper.""

""Sounds perfect for killing a dragon."" Ingrid said.

There was a collective gasp from almost everyone. Except for Philia and Zefir who chuckled.

""Faux pas!"" the two said.

""What?"" Ingrid asked, bewildered.

There was a jumble of words as everyone started speaking but Philia silenced them all.

""Let ME say it."" she said, her voice dripping with relish.

Everyone quieted down as Neith spoke into everyone's earpieces.

""Please let her say it."" The AI said. ""It's only fitting.""

1o41bf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1o41bf5/reveal_the_best_mini_coffee_maker_mecity_kc3002/,Reveal the Best Mini Coffee Maker Mecity KC3002 Review Worth Reading,"Testing out the Mecity KC3002 coffee maker has been a delightful experience sprinkled with a few quirks. Its charming pink design caught my eye right away ‚Äì it‚Äôs compact and cheerful, fitting beautifully on my kitchen counter without hogging precious space. For anyone like me who lives in a small apartment, this is a huge plus. Measuring 11 inches tall and just under 5 inches wide, it slides into tight spots effortlessly, which is just what I needed. I‚Äôve even considered packing it for road trips since the size screams ‚ÄúRV-friendly.‚Äù But aesthetics aren‚Äôt everything, right? Let‚Äôs dig into its capabilities.

**Performance That Brews Confidence**  
This coffee maker doesn't mess around when it comes to speed. The promise of a hot cup in two minutes is no exaggeration. Mornings are hectic in my household, so being able to hit a button, scroll my phone for a bit, and have fresh coffee in hand feels like a game changer. The versatility is what sealed the deal for me. With its 3-in-1 capability, it can handle K-cup capsules, ground coffee, and even loose tea. Switching between coffee and tea was seamless, thanks to the two unique filter holders included. It‚Äôs almost like it anticipates my caffeine (or calming tea) mood swings.

**User-Focused Positives**  
- Compact and lightweight, making it ideal for apartments, dorms, and RVs.  
- Two-minute brewing time keeps routines rolling smoothly.  
- Handles K-cup pods, ground coffee, and loose tea, offering versatility.  
- A user-friendly one-touch control system simplifies brewing.  
- Auto shut-off for an added layer of safety and convenience.  

**[Check Mecity KC3002 price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0cqxmtv4z/)**  

**Sophisticated Design Meets Simple Maintenance**  
Aside from its sleek style, the Mecity KC3002 stands out with its easy-clean design. Other coffee machines I‚Äôve owned have had a knack for splashing grinds all over the place, turning the cleaning process into an unexpected arm workout. This machine, however, changes the game with its uniquely designed filter holder. It keeps brewing tidy, and cleaning the chamber is straightforward. No leftover grinds sneaking into corners ‚Äì just a clean coffee maker, every time. Auto shut-off adds another layer of convenience, especially for forgetful folks like me. Who hasn‚Äôt left a coffee machine running halfway through rushing out the door? 

**Hiccups in the Experience**  
- Noisy brewing operation compared to some competitors.  
- Lacks a large water reservoir, which means constant refilling for multiple cups.  
- Doesn‚Äôt come with additional descaling solutions, something that could have been handy for long-term maintenance.  

**Good Aspects of Brewing Options**  
What grabbed my attention was the simplicity of its touch controls. Hit the button to brew, cancel, or even enter descaling mode ‚Äì the process is foolproof. While the compact water reservoir limits batch potential, I appreciated how easy it was to adjust the brew size. Whether you‚Äôre brewing a small cup or using up all the water, the system accommodates both needs reliably. Still, I did wish the water tank had a larger capacity for those days when caffeine demands seem endless. Descaling mode, activated by holding the power button for three seconds, isn‚Äôt revolutionary, but it‚Äôs a nice touch for keeping things running smoothly.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Smaller brewing capacity isn‚Äôt ideal for households with multiple users.  
- The pink design might not appeal to everyone (though I love it).  
- A few customers mentioned the plastic exterior feels less sturdy compared to more premium builds.  

**Competing Products**  
Stacking it up against other compact coffee makers like the Keurig K-Mini or Nespresso Essenza Mini, the Mecity has a stronger edge in versatility. Unlike the Keurig, which sticks to pods exclusively, this machine welcomes ground coffee and tea with open arms. However, Keurig's water reservoir tends to be larger, so if you‚Äôre a big-batch coffee drinker, that might be something to consider. As for the Nespresso, its sleek designs are tough to beat (and it undeniably feels more premium), but it does limit you to espresso-form drinks. Mecity KC3002 fills a crucial niche for those who want multiple brew options without sacrificing counter space.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Compared to many single-serve coffee makers, the Mecity KC3002 delivers solid functionality for its price. Sure, there are bells and whistles some may miss ‚Äì like app connectivity or smoother brewing mechanisms ‚Äì but for most home users, this strikes a great balance. I found it particularly appealing because of its 3-in-1 brewing capabilities and speed, which are typically features found in pricier machines. If value-for-money coffee solutions matter to you, this little guy‚Äôs got the goods.

He said my grandfather has transitioned to a different place. He didn't know where he was anymore. I assume it means that he's going into the light. 

I've had after death communications from a woman I dearly loved. She stayed with me for a while, and then also transitioned. Where she's at now is a place made from white light. It's all peace, love, innocence, etc. 

So, it seems that the afterlife has a demarcation between the astral worlds, and a higher place that is made of white light. I'm not exactly sure about that, but the idea of transitioning in the afterlife suggests to me that there are higher places that resemble ""heaven."" What do you think?

Over a decade ago, no one imagined that a simple ceramic cone would transform the world of specialty coffee.

Enter the Japanese **Hario V60**, now the global symbol of manual brewing and precision craftsmanship.



The genius lies in its simplicity: a 60-degree angle ensures balanced flow, while the single large hole at the bottom allows the brewer full control over pouring speed ‚Äî and thus extraction.

With the V60, the result depends less on the tool and more on the user‚Äôs skill, timing, and understanding of how water and coffee interact.



What makes the V60 ideal for specialty coffee is its **scientific flexibility**. Every variable can be tuned ‚Äî grind size, water temperature, pour rate, and even spiral motion.

Modern baristas now use digital sensors and programmed pour curves via **Poursteady** and **Acaia Brewguide**, turning brewing into a form of coffee engineering.



Yet, despite all the tech, the V60 preserves its soul ‚Äî a pure, transparent cup that expresses the bean‚Äôs character with honesty.

That balance between science and artistry is why it remains the top choice in World Brewers Cup competitions worldwide.



The V60 isn‚Äôt just a tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a philosophy: calm, control, and care in every pour.

1o418r1,https://i.redd.it/zvdrlzamniuf1.jpeg,Why Professional Photography Is Non-Negotiable for Real Estate Agents in 2025,"In the hyper-competitive real estate market, the difference between a listing that languishes and one that sells quickly often comes down to one crucial factor: professional photography. If you're still using your smartphone to capture listing photos, you're leaving money on the table‚Äîboth for your clients and yourself.

# The Digital Storefront: Where Home Shopping Begins

Today's homebuyers don't start their journey by driving through neighborhoods or calling agents. They start by scrolling through listings online, often on their phones during their morning coffee. According to the National Association of Realtors, 97% of homebuyers use the internet in their home search, and the first thing they notice? Your photos.

Your listing photos are your digital storefront. Just as a brick-and-mortar store invests in window displays, real estate agents must invest in professional photography to capture attention in those critical first seconds of online browsing.

# The Numbers Don't Lie: ROI of Professional Photography

Let's talk business. Professional real estate photography isn't an expense‚Äîit's an investment with measurable returns:

**Homes sell faster.**¬†Listings with professional photos spend an average of 32% less time on the market compared to those with amateur photography. In a market where time literally equals money (hello, mortgage payments and carrying costs), this matters tremendously to your sellers.

**Homes sell for more.**¬†Research shows that professionally photographed homes sell for $3,400 to $11,200 more than homes with standard photos. When you consider that professional photography typically costs a few hundred dollars, that's an extraordinary return on investment.

**Listings get more views.**¬†Professional photos generate 61% more online views than amateur photos. More views mean more potential buyers, more showings, and ultimately, better offers.

# Quality Signals Professionalism

When sellers are choosing an agent, they're evaluating your marketing capabilities. Your listing presentation‚Äîincluding photo quality‚Äîspeaks volumes about your commitment to their success.

Professional photography signals:

* You're serious about marketing their property
* You understand modern buyer behavior
* You're willing to invest in getting results
* You pay attention to details that matter

Conversely, poor-quality photos suggest the opposite. In an age where even teenagers can take decent smartphone photos, subpar listing images raise red flags about an agent's overall competence and effort.

# The Technical Advantages You Can't Fake

Professional real estate photographers bring specialized skills and equipment that transform ordinary spaces into compelling visual narratives:

**Superior lighting techniques**¬†that make rooms appear bright, spacious, and inviting‚Äîeven on cloudy days or in homes with limited natural light.

**Wide-angle lenses**¬†that capture entire rooms accurately, helping buyers understand spatial relationships and room flow.

**HDR photography**¬†that balances bright windows with darker interior spaces, ensuring no detail is lost to shadows or overexposure.

**Composition expertise**¬†that highlights a property's best features while minimizing less desirable aspects.

**Professional editing**¬†that corrects color balance, ensures straight lines, and creates a polished, magazine-quality final product.

# The Psychology of Visual Marketing

Human brains process images 60,000 times faster than text. When potential buyers scroll through listings, they're making split-second judgments based almost entirely on visual appeal.

Professional photography leverages psychological principles:

* **Emotional connection:**¬†Beautiful photos help buyers imagine themselves living in the space
* **Perceived value:**¬†High-quality images suggest a high-quality property
* **Trust building:**¬†Professional presentation builds confidence in both the property and the agent
* **Memory retention:**¬†Stunning photos are more memorable and shareable

# Multi-Platform Marketing Power

Professional photos aren't just for the MLS. They're assets you'll use across multiple marketing channels:

* **Social media posts**¬†that stop the scroll
* **Email campaigns**¬†with eye-catching featured images
* **Print materials**¬†like brochures and postcards
* **Your website**¬†portfolio and featured listings
* **Digital advertising**¬†on Facebook, Instagram, and Google

One professional photo shoot creates content that works harder across every platform, multiplying your marketing reach and effectiveness.

# Competitive Differentiation in a Crowded Market

Here's an uncomfortable truth: in most markets, buyers have dozens‚Äîif not hundreds‚Äîof options. When competing listings have similar prices, locations, and features, photography becomes the differentiator.

Professional photos make your listings stand out in search results, capture attention in email alerts, and encourage buyers to click through for more information. They're the difference between ""let's keep looking"" and ""we need to see this one in person.""

# The Smartphone Myth Debunked

""But my phone has a great camera!"" Yes, modern smartphones have impressive cameras, but real estate photography requires more than megapixels:

* Smartphones can't achieve the wide-angle perspective needed to show entire rooms
* Phone cameras struggle with the extreme lighting contrasts in interior spaces
* Amateur photographers often miss crucial angles and details
* Editing skills and professional software make a significant difference
* Consistency across 20-30 listing photos requires expertise and equipment

Professional photographers also understand real estate-specific best practices: decluttering, staging considerations, optimal times of day for exterior shots, and which features buyers prioritize.

# Your Professional Partner in Charlotte and the Piedmont Triad

For real estate agents serving Charlotte NC, Lake Norman, Mooresville, Huntersville, Cornelius, Winston-Salem, and The Piedmont Triad region, having a reliable photography partner is essential to maintaining a competitive edge.

[Mark Jacobs Productions](https://www.markjacobsproductions.com/)¬†specializes in real estate photography throughout the Charlotte and Piedmont Triad markets, understanding the unique architectural styles and buyer preferences in these communities. With local expertise and professional equipment, they help agents showcase properties in the best possible light‚Äîliterally and figuratively.

# Making the Investment Work for You

Professional photography should be a line item in every listing's marketing budget. Here's how to maximize your investment:

1. **Include it in your listing presentation**¬†to show sellers you're committed to premium marketing
2. **Schedule photography early**¬†so you can launch with strong visuals
3. **Use photos everywhere**¬†to maximize their value across all marketing channels
4. **Build relationships**¬†with photographers who understand your style and market
5. **Track results**¬†to demonstrate ROI to current and future clients

# The Bottom Line

In 2025's real estate market, professional photography isn't optional‚Äîit's fundamental to success. The agents who consistently win listings and achieve top results are those who understand that marketing begins with compelling visual content.

Your sellers deserve maximum exposure and the highest possible sale price. You deserve to build a reputation as a top-tier marketing professional. Professional photography delivers both.

The question isn't whether you can afford professional photography. It's whether you can afford not to use it.",1,1760203149.0,u_MJProductions,0,1.0,False

1o418ey,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o418ey,My Trip to Lyon,"LYON REVIEW

I planned our trip using a lot of recommendations and advice from Reddit, so I am giving back by sharing my whole trip including reviews. Hope this helps someone else!

**MY KEY TAKEAWAYS:**

Stay at **Hotel De Verdun 1882**

Eat at **Le Boeuf d‚ÄôArgent**¬†

Tour with **Quentin Walking Tours** 

I visited Lyon for 6 days in early September 2025. I was traveling with my husband and all of his siblings and in-laws, a total of eight people.

First and foremost, I loved Lyon! What a delightful city! So much history, and everyone was so friendly and welcoming. We were there for 6 days, but had some day trips. It was definitely not too much time. I found the city very walkable, and we did mostly walk everywhere. Spoiler, I have no bad reviews of any restaurants. Every place we tried was 5 out of 5 star. My husband and I went to Paris for a few days at the end of the trip, and honestly, I liked Lyon more.¬†

**HOTEL**

Hotel De Verdun 1882 - 82 rue de la Charit√© - 69002 LYON¬†

This hotel was excellent! I highly recommend staying here. It was one of the highlights of my visit.¬†

The owners, Isabella and Gilles, were there to greet us in the lobby each day. They were friendly, kind, helpful and willing to answer all our many questions. In fact, my sister-in-law started communicating with them via email after our reservations were made. They offered advice and recommendations for our trip. At the hotel they have created a booklet with all of their favorite places in Lyon, not just restaurants, but shopping, museums, and day trips.¬†They were so fun to chat with. Really welcoming and accommodating. 

The hotel itself is charming, full of art, interesting books and objects. And it is spotless. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the rooms and lobby. The rooms are so bright and fresh.

They offer breakfast, and honestly I was a bit skeptical expecting a typical hotel breakfast. But this was delicious and fresh everyday. Fresh croissants, pain au chocolat, and baguettes. Local, ripe fruit. Eggs, meats and cheeses. And, of course, coffees and teas.¬†

The location is great. We walked to most of our activities.¬†

**RESTAURANTS**

Le Boeuf d‚ÄôArgent - (dinner) Words cannot describe the incredible experience of dining here. I read about it in another Reddit post where it was described as unforgettable.¬† They were correct, and I am so glad I got to experience dining here. It is a family business. The kitchen is run by a sibling team: Chefs Arianna, Viviana and Antonio Pisacane, and the front of house is Viviana‚Äôs husband and sister-in-law (I think?) It was a seven course tasting menu and each course was better than the last. The chef came to greet us at the end of the meal and she was charming. If I am ever anywhere in France, I will come back to dine here again. Highlight of the trip. If you have to pick just one restaurant in Lyon, it should be this one.¬†

Bulle - (lunch) We had lunch when we went to see the Notre Dame de Fourvi√®re Basilica and Theatre Gallo Romain. The restaurant is elegant and has an amazing view of the city. The food was delicious! I had the ‚Äúmarket menu‚Äù and it was perfect. Not something I would have usually ordered, but I am so glad I tried it. Excellent.

Bouchon Tupin (dinner) - Cozy bouchon. The chicken was really delicious. Others ordered the pork, but the chicken was the best. Friendly service.¬†

Brasserie Georges - (dinner) This was the first restaurant we went to the day we arrived. I read that it was ‚Äútouristy‚Äù, but I thought it was as good and as authentic as some of the other places we went during the week. Great food, generous serving sizes. Beautiful restaurant. Chocolate dessert was a standout.

Cafe Comptoir Abel¬† - (dinner) I mean, honestly, every restaurant had amazing food. I am running out of adjectives. The one mark against this one was if multiple people ordered the same dish, they brought it out family style in one big serving dish. So three of us ordered chicken morels (so good!) and it was not served on individual plates. I didn‚Äôt mind, but some in my group didn't love that.¬†

Daniel & Denise St Jean - (lunch) I definitely had the lunch special here. And, as usual, a delightful and memorable meal.¬†Probably one of the best meals I have ever had (I said this about every restaurant all week).

Bouchon Palais Grillet (dinner) - I felt like this was one of the more authentic bouchons. Again, I am running out of ways to describe incredible meals. I had duck. It was perfect. Excellent food. Very traditional bouchon. 

**ACTIVITIES**

BEAUJOLAIS AND P√âROUGES TOUR¬†(Tasty Lyon: Private Beaujolais & Perouges Tour)

Yann was our tour guide. The tour included being picked up from the hotel, which was nice. Yann was very personable and knowledgeable. Perouges is a medieval town, with a fortress church. Very cool. Beaujolais was beautiful and the vineyard was exquisite. Fun day of history and wine tasting. Great tour.



GUIDED TOUR VIEUX LYON¬†(Quentin Walking Tour)

The whole group loved the tour. Quentin is a charming and engaging guide. Very fun and informative. I wish we did this tour on the first day. So many traboules!¬†Highly recommend. Do it early in your trip.



HALLES DE LYON PAUL BOCUSE

I walked through, but did not eat here. That was a mistake. Others in my group did eat here and raved about it. Just walking through was impressive. Definitely have lunch here.



VIENNE TOUR¬†(Get Your Guide - walking tour Vienne)

A short train ride away, Vienne is a cute, historic town. Pierre was a great guide. I mean, if you have an extra day to fill, it was good.



WALKING TOUR FOURVIERE HILL(Self guided)

Funiculaires de Fourvi√®re / Notre Dame de Fourvi√®re Basilica  / Theatre Gallo Romain¬† 6 rue de l'Antiquaille - 69005 Lyon 5√®me

We did this on our first day, which was a Monday so the museum was closed. We still got to see the Roman Theaters, but I wish we could have gone to the museum. Honestly I just used Rick Steves‚Äô guidebook for this whole day. It was a great resource. (https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/p/france-guidebook)



CROIX-ROUSSE DISTRICT¬†

I think this area does not get the attention it deserves. We went to the silk museum (very small, but interesting) and saw the Mur des Canuts (very large). Great views of the city. Then we walked down (and I mean physically declined!) the large pedestrian street with lots of shops, boutiques and restaurants. I loved this area and would have liked to spend more time here.¬†

I had been living with chronic pain for a while now but it was misdiagnosed as a herniated disc radiating the pain through my nerves of the hip and groin.","Now it‚Äôs a new journey that I just started this week. This Monday I saw my primary care Doctor Who was extremely empathetic to my extreme pain. She prescribed oxycodone 15‚Äì35 for the pain, to be used every six hours as needed for pain. She prescribed so many oxycodone that the pharmacist worried he would run out of his monthly allowance. She also prescribed a stronger blood pressure pill and Flomaz to increase urination. Also a water pill to alleviate my swollen feet and ankles. And in just a few days the edema is pretty much gone aside from the dry skin from the stretching. That had been painful so it is a blessing I don‚Äôt endure it anymore.

Finally PCD also prescribed Clonazepam because my anxiety, which has always been bad, is now off the charts. My hands tremble and shake if I need to write something down. I dreaded going to my oncologist appointment because I had a whole stack of paperwork to fill out. Thankfully Clonazepam calmed my nerves to the point I was able to successfully fill out the forms legibly. It also controlled my nervous over reaction to minor events, such as misplacing my glasses. 

My initial oncologist appointment was only two days after my PCP appointment. We discussed a lot of things and some of them gave me a little hope such as the possibility that I had prostate cancer instead of bone cancer. They stated that was a good thing because it was easier to treat. This initial visit was with the lead oncologist at my local center as well as a supervising doctor teleconference from Phoenix. 

They immediately sent me to the treatment room because my fluids and electrolytes were very low. They also prescribed morphine 15 ER, to be used every 12 hours as needed for pain

When I first searched oxycodone combined with morphine the results from AI were scary: that it could be very dangerous and even deadly. When I rewarded my question suddenly the answer was that it is often used as a combination to deal with serious pain.

My question, and if you have read this far I thank you, is if any of you have heard about being prescribed oxycodone as well as morphine. Because I have trouble sleeping at night and the oxycodone wears off in six hours at the most I thought I would try taking a morphine pill before bed that would hopefully get me through the night.

It was a strange night. I did not feel at ease. I did sleep a little better but I felt a little pain during the night. I realize the ER version in order to last a long time it‚Äôs not as strong but at least it doesn‚Äôt run out.

I then researched sleep meds that I could take that worked for me before: Benadry 
 melatonin, and baclofen. Each one of those, at least via AI, carried strong warnings that it could be very dangerous including death.

Does anyone take any of these combinations? I normally would only take one Benadryl and it would help me sleep or 1/2 a melatonin tablet. And the baclofen was indeed the most successful. Indeed I did take it while I was taking oxycodone and I didn‚Äôt feel any side effects except being groggy in the morning. But after one cup of coffee I felt good and I did not feel like a zombie the rest of the day.

To summarize my questions: is taking both oxycodone and morphine ER really that dangerous, considering it was prescribed by a competent oncologist. Also is a small dose of Benadryl or melatonin really that dangerous? 

I feel terrible without good sleep so I‚Äôm sure that is dangerous in end of itself.

I‚Äôm sorry if I posted this in the wrong sub. But I have been perusing this sub ever since I‚Äôve been diagnosed and started taking these meds. And the people here seem to be well-versed in how the meds work together or counteract each other. So I‚Äôm hoping someone might have a little advice. Of course I will follow up with my doctor but it‚Äôs the weekend now so I have to wait until Monday. My insurance allows me and on-call nurse 24-7 if I have concerns but I‚Äôm not sure they will have the knowledge that even this sub haa amassed.

If I am in the wrong place I can post this in the cancer sub. They are very helpful. I only thought there might be more experience with various meds to help with pain here.

Thank you.

They‚Äôre at the top of every menu. Cow‚Äôs milk is standard in every cafe. But what happens if you flip the default?

The¬†[graph from Faunalytics](https://faunalytics.org/tactics-in-practice-the-science-of-plant-based-defaults-and-nudges/)¬†shows what happens if the vegan option is the default option on a menu, with meat only available upon request, compared to the reverse. The effect on people‚Äôs choices is huge ‚Äì and we can see that non-vegans are a lot less motivated to eat meat at each meal than we might expect.¬†

Other evidence-based plant-based-default behavioural ‚Äònudges‚Äô include having more plant-based than meat-based dishes on the menu; moving plant-based dishes to the top of the menu and out of a ‚Äòvegan/vegetarian‚Äô section; and not calling them ‚Äòvegan‚Äô, ‚Äòvegetarian‚Äô, ‚Äòplant-based‚Äô, ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô or anything else that sounds grim/depriving but describing them in terms of their lovely flavors, textures, provenance and ingredients (e.g., ‚ÄúCuban Black Bean Soup‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúVegetarian Black Bean Soup‚Äù).

Vegan and vegetarian dishes are discreetly marked with symbols so that people can still see what they‚Äôre eating ‚Äì and the benefits for animals are huge, because animal consumption and animal harm is is being cut on a far larger scale than the tiny percentage of¬†vegans or vegetarians in our populations can achieve as individuals through their own dietary choices.

The US-based Better Food Foundation is the leader in promoting the use of behavioural ‚Äònudge‚Äô techniques like this to cut consumption of animal-based foods ‚Äì and they‚Äôre having enormous success. Due to their work, more than 500 institutions, businesses, and organisations now use plant-based nudge strategies in their catering. Because meat/dairy/fish/eggs stay on the menu ‚Äì though shoved into the corner ‚Äì there‚Äôs no reason for pushback.

1o4160a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o4160a,BQEYZ Frost Review ‚Äì The Warm Soul  ($179),"Hi, this is ADR from Electro Audio World.  
I‚Äôve been using the¬†**BQEYZ Frost**¬†for about a week now, mostly paired with my¬†**iPhone 14 Pro Max**¬†and the **Apple Lightning Dongle**.  
Yeah, I know ‚Äî that‚Äôs a pretty basic setup. No fancy external DACs or amps this time.  
But honestly, that‚Äôs part of the fun. It lets you hear what these IEMs¬†*really*¬†sound like without extra coloration or EQ trickery.  
Just plug in, hit play, and find out what they can do in everyday use walking to work, grabbing coffee, zoning out to some music.

Later on, I‚Äôll try the Frost with a dedicated DAP and share those impressions separately.

F**irst Impressions & Build**

True to its name,¬†*Frost*¬†feels cold to the touch solid aluminum housing with a perfectly smooth finish.  
It‚Äôs got that clean, icy sheen that catches the light without being flashy.  
Build quality is absolutely top-tier for this price: no rough edges, no weird seams, and it fits in the ear like it was made for it.

The shells are compact, seal nicely, and stay put during long sessions without creating pressure spots.  
Even the cable feels premium for its class soft, braided, non-microphonic, and the connectors are snug.  
It‚Äôs a small thing, but if you‚Äôre using these on your daily commute, you‚Äôll appreciate that level of refinement.

**Sound Signature**

**Smooth. Clean. Surprisingly Addictive.**

In short, Frost isn‚Äôt for bassheads or treble chasers it‚Äôs for people who appreciate¬†*balance*¬†and¬†*maturity*¬†in tuning. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúwow‚Äù IEM that punches you with sub-bass or crispy highs right away.  
Instead, it grows on you the longer you listen.

**Bass**

Controlled, tight, and nicely textured.  
It doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the mix, yet provides enough body to give rhythm and groove.  
There‚Äôs no mid-bass bleed, and nothing gets muddy.  
It‚Äôs the kind of low end that supports the track rather than dominates it.

**Mids**

Here‚Äôs where the Frost earns its name smooth, neutral, with just a touch of warmth.  
Vocals are natural and correctly placed in the mix.  
Female voices (think Lana Del Rey) sound lush and creamy, while male vocals carry that studio-grade density without sounding thick.  
Even straight out of the iPhone dongle, mids retain detail and texture, which shows the drivers are doing serious work on their own.

**Treble**

Detailed but never harsh.  
You get enough air and sparkle to keep things lively, but it avoids the fatiguing sharpness that plagues many hybrids. Cymbals, hi-hats, and upper harmonics feel open yet smooth.  
This isn‚Äôt an analytical treble like what you‚Äôd hear from an Etymotic or Moondrop Blessing 3 it‚Äôs more musical, more forgiving, but still revealing.

Technical Performance

This is where Frost punches well above its price.  
The soundstage isn‚Äôt the largest, but the imaging and separation are spot-on.  
Everything feels clean, organized, and tonally coherent.  
Transient response is fast not razor-sharp like some all-BA sets, but natural and consistent.

iPhone + Apple Dongle Synergy

Honestly? Surprisingly good.  
Apple still uses Cirrus Logic DACs, and they pair beautifully here.  
The Frost doesn‚Äôt need much power, and the dongle drives it cleanly with great dynamics.  
Sure, a higher-end DAC or DAP would open up the stage and add a bit more sub-bass weight,  
but you‚Äôre already getting about 90% of its potential right out of the Lightning jack and that‚Äôs impressive.

Genre Pairing

* **Acoustic / Jazz / Indie:**¬†Excellent ‚Äì fluid and emotional.
* **Pop / R&B:**¬†Balanced and enjoyable, vocals really shine.
* **Metal / EDM:**¬†Maybe a bit too polite lacks some slam.
* **Classical:**¬†Beautiful layering and timbre; strings sound natural.

Comparisons

If I had to place it in context:

* Tonally close to the¬†**Letshuoer Cadenza 4**.
* Smoother and more organic than the¬†**Moondrop Aria**.
* Similar to¬†**SeeAudio Yume II**, though Frost has a softer treble roll-off.

If you chase absolute resolution, there are sharper options out there.  
But if you want something you can listen to for¬†*hours*¬†without fatigue, the Frost makes a strong case for itself.

Final Thoughts

The¬†**BQEYZ Frost**¬†feels like that quiet, confident friend who doesn‚Äôt need to shout to be heard.  
It doesn‚Äôt try to wow you with exaggerated dynamics instead, it wins you over with¬†**consistency, finesse, and honest tonality.**  
In a world where every new IEM tries to be a marketing monster, Frost brings a refreshing dose of¬†*old-school maturity*.

Pair it with something as simple as an iPhone and Apple Dongle, and you‚Äôve got a portable, neutral, genuinely enjoyable setup.  
If you‚Äôre a detail chaser looking for the ultimate resolution, maybe look elsewhere.  
But if you value texture, warmth, and musical honesty Frost deserves your attention.

**Verdict**  
Smooth & balanced tuning  
Natural mids and vocals  
Tight, textured bass without bloat  
Pairs beautifully with iPhone dongle  
Best for: relaxed listening, acoustic, jazz, and vocal-heavy music

Thanks for reading.

So listen to my story,i found a new cafe at my region .There is a girl that works as a barista.I saw her a 2 times I took my take away coffee and left without talking.But I want to ask this girl out.So I met her 2 days after.I was determined to talk to her.In fact she begun first and asked me if i was at work this day.I replied so then I asked her of she studies.So we found out we are both engineers .I told her ""we could be coworkers "" and we speak the same ""language"" in a flirty way.Ok she was positive .But here I think I made the mistake .We talked a bit but I forgot to ask her name and I stuck.I didnt want to rush and ask her out and I had the mindset that she will see me again.In fact she told me she works the tomorrow day.So I was determined to talk a lit bit tomorrow amd her out.But the other day I couldnt talk to her easily.There was another barista coworker so I didnt want to make her feel uncomfortable.She asked me how i am,I told her I didnt sleep very much because I went out at night.She told me that she was out to with friend and she told me she was with a guy friend but she gave me the message that this guy is just ""a friend "" not a boyfriend.But I couldnt ask her out so I left disappointed.Yhe other day I went again but there was her supervisor in front.Again I felt disapointed and angry with myself that I didnt ask her out the day I could.
I am a stubborn guy I went there again and she just talked to me like she doessnt know me.I left defeated.
You know I think I have created some social anxiety about asking out this barista.The fact that I  chicken to aske her out whe there are people inn front of us has made me think I am afraid of the social pressure .What do you think I should do ?",1,1760202934.0,PickUpArtist,3,1.0,False
1o415jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dehradun/comments/1o415jn/lonesome_ranthoping_to_make_friends_23/,Lonesome rant(hoping to make friends) 23,"Hey there everyone, I'm raqs (using my nickname because nobody knows about it other than my one single friend who actually gave it), 23.

So I recently started working in a company in IT Park as a social media designer, the job is really interesting, I get to do what really interests me,ig most people don't get that,so I feel blessed in a way.

HERE GOES THE RANT-: So, the childhood was good,but teenage start hone ke baad se I realised that I'm very bad at socializing with other people, like haan once I get comfortable(maybe a week), But uske baad bhi I don't know why most of the people I met in life,jinke sath genuinely acha lga rehne me, they left me for no reason, a song I used to listen daily by Jagjit Singh, Hothon se choo lo tum.. There's a line in that, Jag ne mujse cheena, muje jo bhi lga pyaara...and I can relate to this HARDCORE...

So, starting a job in IT park, I thought I'll get to meet some new people, finally I'll be able to socialize and make friends, but I'm working in a startup and most of the people working there are older than me..

.I can't relate to them and also they're busy with their life as most of them are either in relationships or married...I thought koi social club hoga IT park me where I can meet other people but there is none..

And even though hota bhi to I don't think so mai baat bhi kr paata kisi se.. my usual routine is, office jaana,kaam krna and then...ghr jaane ka man nhi krta, kya krunga ghr jaake bhi, so mai kisi cafe me, kisi tapri pr ek coffee ek cig leke beth jaata hun..

It's getting worse day by day, I see people in groups, and it's not like it started because of my expectations ki job lgegi to socialize krne ko milega..it started when I joined first year in my college,

Drop out krke aaya tha, 1 saal se socialize nhi kiya tha, fir then it started getting worse, mera friend group ek jagah beth kr baatein krte they and mai bahaney maarke side me beth ta tha just because I was too anxious,..

Idk anxious about what exactly, looks? Communication? I was never weird, girlfriends rhi hain but unse breakup ke baad it got even worse,

Tbh it's been 6 years, since I started getting suidal thoughts, depression, anxiety but never talked about it with anyone,..No I'm not pessimistic or har waqt negative baatein nhi bolta,...last kuch months me I didn't got a single thought about suide but it has started again,

I try to distract myself through work but kaam khtm hone ke baad, logon ki stories dekhta hun koi club me hai, to koi dosto ke sath cafe gya hai...

and mai yahan coffee aur sutta pee rha hun..I just think sometimes ki kisi se jaake baat krun, but nhi jaata, usey weird lga to? Ya fir kyun hi baat krega koi? There's no connection.. I'm just a stranger

As I told I've had 2 girlfriends in the past but never really had a girl-friend( mahila mitr ~), ek thi...and tbh usey behen maanta tha, room leke rehti thi apne bf ke sath, pese nhi hote they unke paas to mai de deta tha, gaadi de deta tha..baad me pta chla they use to bitch about me ü´†...

I've had the experience of talking about my situation with another guy and he told me bhai tu ladka hai,softy kyun bn rha hai..

So, here's the deal... anyone working or studying near IT Park, or they think ki there is a slot empty for me to become friends with them you can hit me up.... I listen to music, Used to produce too..Now I work as a social media designer, would like to go out,have some fun,laugh, I don't judge, we're all humans..ü´† bye..",1,1760202922.0,Dehradun,6,1.0,False

I thought, maybe, I could cultivate an appreciation for reading, if only I carefully decided which ones were tailored to a person‚Äôs interests. Maybe they need only be initiated into the habit somehow? This is not the case. 

An example: I knew someone who expressed a genuine curiosity in the lives of Native Americans before Colombian contact. Perfect, I thought, I will lend them a book I happen to own on the very topic. So I offer them 1491 by Charles C Mann, which is a decent pop history on the subject, and he just will not take it. He literally cannot fathom himself reading, and he told me as much. I left it out on my coffee table, thinking maybe they‚Äôll try it anyway, and it remained there after he left.

This is not a complaint about the machine I own. This is a complaint about some snippy customer support agent who seems to think they have an MBA from Harvard and knows how to run a business. 

Backstory: I have a Beanz.con monthly subscription but noticed my orders were not counting towards the rewards spend. 

Action: 
Asked customer support about this and the response was that because I was getting a discount, the spend didn‚Äôt count. 

In truth, I had only received a discount on my last two orders because I cancelled the subscription and they tempted me to stay. I pointed this out stating that I had not received any spend count even when spending with no discount and I also politely pointed out that the response also makes no sense because I only get a reward to use against future orders after spending a certain amount and by giving me a discount means it would take me longer to get there. 

The last response: ‚ÄúThis is a good question. There is something not taken into account in the question, the cost of doing business. A discount on the order of coffee doesn't change how much it costs for that bag of coffee to be made.‚Äù

What kind of idiotic response is this from a customer service agent? I‚Äôm asking a legitimate question with a legitimate logical response and this motherf**ker responds like that?

Once he was in a rage and hit holes in the wall in front of me and my sister. I think i was 10. I remember he threw a pizza at my mom once, and once on easter he threw coffee inside and it was everywhere. I remember when i was 10 he told me he was leaving and i was ‚Äú90% of this shit‚Äù. He once said he wishes i wasnt born, think i was 11.

From their annual report:

[image](https://d2qkqhh60b0n0e.cloudfront.net/images/682cd249-03cc-4320-b825-c47822ad8591)

So they use flexible by buying name-brand consumables ""opportunistically"" through a centralized purchasing team to acquire product at significant discount.

They created a franchise model where independent operators. They share 50% of store-level gross profits with $GO. 

So, in essence, their business model relies on their ""WOW!"" deals to create a treasure hunt shopping experience. Pretty innovative.

[image](https://d2qkqhh60b0n0e.cloudfront.net/images/e1883be5-71b5-42a9-9415-5f62ab5c5ec0)

Purchasing is mentioned a ton in the annual report. This makes sense, but isn't the first thing I'd think about as 

*Note: this is part of my on-going research as I'm looking to buy equity in a local bodega in the town I live*

Revenue growth: very steady, compounding at 9.5% 5-year, 8.5% 1-year. Mostly due to adding new stores (opened 67 in 2024 alone). Minor growth due to ""comparable store"" growth of 2.7% in 2024, driven by a 4.2% increase in the number of transactions partially offset by a 1.4% decrease in average transaction size.

(good for me to note how they grew revenue, same store sales will be a KPI for our Bodega... but that may only be a one-trick pony once it is optimized).

Gross profit sits around 30%. 

Operating and Net income are RAZOR thin at 1.8% and .9% of sales (damn). This is a steep decrease from 2023, due to new store openings.

They acquired ""United Grocery Outlet"" in 2024, which is why they added so many stores in 2024.

My key takeaways:* Purchasing matters immensely
* Expect a 30-35% gross margin* Need to understand 'deli/coffee/bodega' margins over just groceries

* Inventory turns are hyper important for retailers* Inventory turnover = COGS/Avg Inventory
* 10-14x is good

*  Rent as % of sales should be &lt;6%
* Seasonality: expect 2-3x higher sales during peak season
* Labor as % of sales 18-22% of sales

Single people usually see me as completely whiny and annoying, so it's hard too. And since they did not live the experience of a marriage and a divorce, they cannot empathize. 

Yesterday I went on a dating app but I deleted it immediately. I'm scared of men who focus their interest on me living alone.

I was eyeing the lattecrema cool upgrade which unlocks the cold drinks for you. I thought it would cool the milk and set the coffee temperature to be cold/unheated when you select the cold drinks.

Turns out, all it does is not heat the milk. Coffee is still hot. Milk is not cold. Seems like this could have easily been done depending on the drink you choose considering for eg Caffelatte and Cold Caffelatte are listed separately. Also half the drinks it unlocks are milk-less drinks like cold espresso. In that case it literally does nothing. It tells you to put ice.

Just seems like a total scam and a huge turn off from the company. Sure I could have looked up detailed videos regarding this to know that it does absolutely nothing, but Lattecrema Cool that ""unlocks"" the cold drinks certainly implies that it cools something not just tells you ""Add 4 cubes of ice"".

1o40p56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1o40p56/almost_three_years_later/,Almost three years later,"I don't use this subreddit as much. In the beginning, I was here every day. The pet I lost was a dog named Saber who got out of our yard while I was out of town, with our coonhound Tibby. He was an all black pit mix who grew up with a mostly cement yard, so when we finally moved out into the country and gave him grass, he still preferred to be walked on the road. For anyone who lives out in the countryside, you're probably familiar with the way there aren't many street lights. People speed down the turns in the darkness. 

Tibby came home. Saber didn't. There are several things I will never be able to forget about that night. I will never forget seeing that glossy black lump on the side of the road after someone called and told me my baby was seen on South Venison. I can still hear myself saying ""that's not..."" and then my husband's voice starting to scream ""NO! NO!"" as he jumped out of my still-moving car. I will never forget rushing to put it in park and then making my own way over to where my husband was kneeling by the lump, which was Saber. Cold and stiff with his eyes closed. I will never forget the stranger who pulled over to make sure we were okay, who picked us both up off the ditch beside the road and offered empathy while most just drove by. 

In my marriage, I have been lucky to never have to be the strong one. That was always my husband. But that night, I was strong for us. While he fell apart, I knew we had to bring out boy home. I knew we couldn't just leave him there. I knew we needed to help his soul find his way home so it wasn't lost on that road forever. I had picked Saber up so many times, pulled him up into my lap, this adorable wiggly giant, yet that night the weight of death made him so much heavier. 

I will never forget the nights I woke up to him sitting by my side of the bed, staring at me, waiting patiently for me to make a little room so he could snuggle up next to me, where his butt was my pillow. There are still nights where I wake up and look to that spot. I still hold the back door open just a little bit longer so his spirit, if it's lingering, can come in after the other dogs do. 

I will never forget the way I had already given him a goodbye snuggle before leaving for my trip, when I had to circle back into the kitchen for something and he followed me in, and sat down looking up at me. The way I said ""I already said bye to you,"" and brushed him off. I will never stop wishing for a do-over of that moment. I will never stop regretting that trip. 

Before Saber died, I was planning to leave my husband. At first, I thought he would be okay because he had Saber. Then a day before my trip, I remember thinking ""I don't think I can leave Saber."" It felt like the universe took him from us both as a means of saying ""you can't keep scapegoating this decision on a dog."" 

For the next year, I was the strong one in our marriage. My husband talked about hurting himself in ways I have never heard before. It came to a point where I had to tell him that if he truly felt that's what he needed to do, then he needed to go stay with his mother because I didn't think I could survive finding another dead body of someone else I loved. 

I didn't really grieve Saber until a few months ago. I kept all of it bottled tight because if both of us fell apart, our other dogs would starve and we would lose our home. 

Shortly after he died, I was on NextDoor. I had made an account to post about our missing dogs. Someone posted about these two tiny dogs that seemed to have been abandoned at the end of a road near some train tracks. Saber was always the big brother to the world, that's what we called him. He protected everything he saw. He fought off our other dogs to save kittens, bunnies, skinks, birds, kids. He was everyone's protector. And when I saw those two dogs and read the post saying they had a rescue that would cover their expenses but only if they got a foster lined up, I knew Saber would want me to help them. 

One of the dogs was hit by a train before the rescue could catch her. The other was shaken up and looked like he had been given a hard life. He took months just to come out of his crate. He had burn marks all over his back and especially where a collar would have been, scarring so no fur grew. He growled at everything and didn't want us near him. 

Little by little, he started to trust me and later my husband. We named him Ralphie. I took him to meet several possible forever homes. I warned them all that he had been abused by someone and it would take time, but that he was a sweet boy once you got to know him. He was adopted and returned three times by people who swore they understood that he needed time and then took him to meet small kids within a day. 

Around February this year, I made a tiktok of Ralphie on my bed while I sang ""Look at this handsome mans"" at him over and over. He just rolled onto his back so I could rub his belly, he kept licking my hand. He had come so far from the scared little chi that once tried to bite everyone that came close. Someone commented ""come on folks, like and share, we know what to do!"" In two hours, this angel in Virginia reached out. 

We drove three hours north while she drove three hours south with all three of her dogs in the backseat to come meet Ralphie and see if it was a good fit. Immediately, I knew he was her dog. He was so calm when she picked him up. Not a tremble or growl. They loved each other right away, so he went home with her. 

Saber would have been proud. That night, without the little bald chi superglued to my side in the bed, after my husband had healed as much as he could, I fell apart. I finally said goodbye to Saber. 

I will never stop uttering ""my poor sweet boy,"" whenever I think of him. I don't think I'll ever stop missing him. When my husband and I talk about that day, we don't say ""when Saber died."" We say ""when it happened,"" ""that day,"" ""the awful thing."" We avoid South Venison Road. I keep tissues in my car because my husband still relives the moment when he's in the passenger's seat. Saber was his emotional support animal, and in his absence, I became his emotional support human the way I probably always should have been. 

What almost broke us individually rebuilt us as a couple. That doesn't mean I won't always wish it hadn't happened. If biting the bullet and leaving my husband sooner would have meant Saber would still be here, I would do it in a heartbeat. But it's a bell we can't un-ring. I'm thankful for the love I have found, for the strength I proved was always in me, for the man I married. Not everyone gets it. Some people might read this and think my husband is a weak man for falling apart like that over a dog. It's the guilt that crushed him. He was supposed to be watching the dogs, but he went inside to get his coffee and a storm that night had blown open the gate they escaped through. Had he stayed outside, he would have seen it happen and called them back. I hate that in the hours before I got home, he was suffering all that anxiety and fear by himself. 

Saber taught me a way to love that I had never really felt. I thought I knew what it looked like. I thought I was good at loving people. Saber taught me, even after he was gone, how to push my feelings aside to take care of my loved ones when they need help. That's another thing I will never forget. In all of these lessons, Saber lives on. ",5,1760201827.0,Petloss,1,1.0,False

My background is that I used to have 1000mg+ of caffeine a day between coffee, caffeine tabs and pre workout drinks. Clearly excessive and not healthy nomatter what your views are on caffeine. Over the past couple years I‚Äôve been on and off it multiple times normally lasting 3-4 months followed by a month of drinking caffeine. It‚Äôs mostly habitual to me as I get little to no energy from it. I could fall asleep immediately after an XL cup of coffee.

 My post however is to discuss something I noticed more recently. Every time after quitting caffeine I would get a day or two of headaches (the first time I quit it was a week straight and extremely painful headaches). Most recently instead of quitting caffeine I simply switched to black tea. Interestingly despite still having caffeine in my diet the headaches returned. Has anyone felt that there was something else in coffee that is causing many of there symptoms? For example I get a lot of brain fog if I drink coffee for an extended period of time. But I don‚Äôt experience that with other sources of caffeine.

1o40ni3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1o40ni3/discover_carbona_laundry_detergent_sheets_review/,Discover Carbona Laundry Detergent Sheets Review Are They Truly Eco-Friendly and Effective?,"Trying out the Carbona B0CHL5HN1T Laundry Detergent Sheets was an unexpected venture into eco-friendly territory for me. As someone who typically relies on bulky liquid detergents, I was curious about how these compact sheets would handle the mess my family manages to create on a daily basis. I tossed these into various challenging scenarios over a month, from gym clothes and coffee spills to the frightening mystery stains kids are prone to leaving behind. Here's my not-too-flowery take on it.

**Compact Design That Fits Anywhere**  
This generic detergent product is a game-changer in the portability department. Each package is lightweight and barely takes up any space, which made it a dream companion for a recent camping trip. Normally, I dread lugging around my usual detergent bottles, but slipping a pack of these ultra-thin sheets into my backpack was an entirely hassle-free experience. The recyclable plastic pouch ensures that everything stays mess-free, whether in your pantry or your luggage. It's incredibly convenient for travel enthusiasts and those with limited storage spaces, like dorm dwellers.

[Check Carbona B0CHL5HN1T price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0chl5hn1t/)

**Hard-Hitting Stain Removal Abilities**  
These sheets claim to fight tough stains, and I won't lie‚ÄîI was skeptical at first. Coffee spills and chocolate were my main adversaries in this test, and to my surprise, the product tackled them like a pro. The detergent worked effectively in both warm and cold water, a pleasant surprise considering a lot of eco-friendly products I've tried fail to deliver such consistent results in cooler temperatures. That said, it stumbled a little on oil-based stains, which required a second wash or supplemental stain treatment.

**Gentle on Clothes Yet Powerful on Dirt**  
My delicate blouses, dark jeans, and son's favorite graphic t-shirts all came out looking great after a spin with this detergent. The lack of perfumes and dyes was a huge plus for my family, especially for my youngest, who has sensitive skin. The Free & Clear promise lived up to its name, which is not something I can say for all ""sensitive-friendly"" options out there. It's lovely knowing you‚Äôre using something that‚Äôs not harsh on textiles but still gives a thorough cleanse.

**Eco-Friendly Features That Don‚Äôt Feel Like a Compromise**  
The environmental angle is what drew me in. Unlike liquid detergents that come in heavy plastic bottles, this product's lightweight nature and recyclable packaging are genuinely thoughtful touches. Although I adore the minimal waste aspect, I can't help but wonder how environmentally intensive the production process is for these sheets. Regardless, their mess-free use compared to regular detergents is a win.

**Advantages**  
- Compact and lightweight, perfect for travel and small spaces.  
- No spills or leaks, thanks to safe packaging.  
- Works reliably in various water temperatures.  
- Gentle formula with no perfume or dyes, suitable for sensitive skin.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Struggles with more stubborn oil-based stains without pre-treatment.  
- You might need two sheets for larger or dirtier loads, which could add up.  

**Competing Products**  
When it comes to alternatives, liquid detergents like Seventh Generation's Free & Clear option are worth mentioning. While this rival excels in tackling a wider variety of stains and typically comes in bulk sizes for cost efficiency, it falls short in portability and eco-friendliness due to its plastic-heavy packaging. Similarly, Tru Earth Eco-Strips offer a comparable laundry sheet product but might outperform in versatility for stain types, albeit at a slightly higher price point. Compared to these competitors, this product distinguishes itself with a solid middle ground of effective cleaning, skin-friendliness, and portability at a more affordable quality.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Pricing-wise, this product lands right in the sweet spot between budget-friendly detergents and premium ‚Äúgreen‚Äù options. Given its excellent portability, recyclable packaging, and solid stain-cleaning capabilities, it delivers substantial bang for the buck. Sure, you might use a tad more during heavy laundry days, but the overall cost-efficiency remains appealing. Whether you're traveling or just looking to reduce your ecological footprint, it justifies its investment.

\- Location will look worse on future job applications

\- Would require me to spend 1.5 hours a day driving

  
If you were in my shoes, what would you do? With Option A, I am worried that I will be limiting my future career because this internship does not train on the skills I want to use in the future. With Option B, I am worried that I am limiting my ""social/emotional"" options and will be stuck in the ""wake up, commute, work, commute, go home, sleep"" and will fall into a depression because it's quite literally in the middle of nowhere.

People keep telling me ""it's only for a year"" but I feel like they're not understanding that both offers have trade offs that will impact me significantly. What advice would you offer to someone who is struggling to make a decision like this?",1,1760201533.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

My (25F) friend invited me to her graduation party in mid-August, and one of her relatives was there, we'll call her Diana (25F). I was the only person who was not related to her who was invited to my friend's party. I interacted with Diana a little bit. At this graduation party, I found out Diana is bi, mainly because she was outed by her aunt. Anyways, I felt a certain way about Diana, and I found her social media, reached out to her there, asked her out for coffee/initiated planning the meetup, and got her number. We actually met up in late August, the meetup was 2 hours from both of us (we live 4 hours away). We had an 8 hour date (?), where we had food, walked around, and talked. I even came out to her. On this meetup, I learned/noticed that Diana 1) talks extremely quietly, even when we're walking around or eating 2) avoids eye contact 3) does not express emotions/has a ""flat affect"" (e.g. when she finds something funny, she hides her laughs) 4) has to be set up to date by her friends and 5) does not use her phone much. Also, while waiting for the food at the restaurants, she would bring out her diary/journal and would write in it, or read her book. This happened 3 times. Also, after she learned about my sexuality, she started talking to me more and asking me more personal questions.

So Diana is in a graduate program that involves a lot of reading and writing, and from my understanding, is working several jobs as well. Before we went out for coffee, she had finished her 2nd week of school. Since going out for coffee, I would text her, and she'd eventually started taking a while to respond. I kind of attributed this to maybe her feeling tired from her responsibilities. I was okay with the slower texts, as long she was texting me, answering my questions, and inquiring about me. Well, I ask her if she wants to do something together again, and I take the reins on planning. We decide to go to a classical music concert, in early October, and we each pay $90 for tickets. Basically, I also ask about if she wanted to do other things apart from the concert, and I make plans based on whatever she says we can do.

So anyways, the concert date is approaching. Our texts are pretty slow and spaced out, but she brings up the concert and that she's excited for it. The day before the concert, though, I let her know about parking and other logistics planning stuff, and she's agreeing. I think everything is going fine, until she agrees to plans and then immediately says she's not feeling well (she had to leave work early) and that she may not be able to go to the concert. I'm a bit sad, but I decide to check-in on her the morning of the concert, and ultimately, she tells me she's not going to the concert because of how sick she feels, and that she wants me to enjoy the concert without her. I actually don't end up going, and the next day I get a text from her asking about the concert. I tell her very honestly I didn't go because I felt sad, and she apologizes. I divert the conversation to school, and she tells me she's struggling with school.

Now, the last time we've texted was Wednesday night. It's Saturday and I'm still waiting for her text. I haven't told her how I feel about her (I really like her), and the last conversation was sort of about school. I hope things aren't over between us, but what are the next steps I could take? I hope this is not over.",1,1760201458.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Stripes (Rival/Backstab): Loves mocking Stripes and provoking his anger. Despite their rivalry, Ardoze respects his honor and speed.

üìú Backstory

Known as The Shadowborn Creator of the Apex, Ardoze gained infamy for stealing DNA and forging monstrous hybrids infused with his own dark energy. Once offered the power of light by the ancient King T. Rex statue, he instead chose darkness ‚Äî a choice the statue deemed evil but allowed. This decision transformed him into the Dark King of the Aerodactylus Tribe, spreading destruction across the Apex World.
From his colossal fortress at Mountain Rock Cliff Circle, Ardoze conducts twisted experiments, seeking to create a perfect army of corrupted hybrids to dominate the world. Revered and feared as one of the most dangerous villains in Apex history, he is a force of evil and ambition that no hero can afford to underestimate.

1o40j22,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1o40j22/first_prolonged_fast/,First prolonged fast,"Just completed my first multi-day water/coffee only fast. I‚Äôd like to preface that I normally eat only 1 meal a day and have been doing so for few yrs, so my body may have been more prepared to not having food for prolonged periods than others.

When it exactly started is up for debate üòÜ my last meal was Sunday night housing pizza after drinking. Not ideal I know. Monday morning I knew I was planning on fasting but I took a few fiber supplements early in morning and then realized I put my mushroom nootropic booster in my coffee that had few cals, so lets say conservative last calories were noon on Monday. From then on water/black coffee only

Broke my fast on Thursday night around 8:00 with few eggs followed by couple of light beers, felt amazing Friday. Lets call it 80 hours of true fast.

Something amazing happened, pretty much from Wednesday morning on I was cracked on energy, idk where it came from. I was in a state of heightened mental clarity, crushing it at work, working out (I ran 2miles every day no problem Monday-Thursday which is normal for me during week). No hunger cravings, I was crushing water like no other. The motivation & clarity I had were unlike anything I‚Äôve felt in a long time. Is this normal?? I must have lost 10lbs, I didn‚Äôt measure but can see it. Crazy how 4 days can reset my entire mentality and what felt like months of slipping in both my mindset & diet.

Looking forward to the next journey, is it safe to carry on like this every or every other week or does the body need time to reset? Any areas improvement to highlight? (I think my last pre-fast meal would be one). Now time to enjoy my ribeye and porcini stuffed tortellinis as reward tonight üòã. Happy Fasting!",1,1760201412.0,fasting,2,1.0,False
1o40hkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1o40hkx/the_owner_keeps_inviting_the_motel_goblins_back/,The Owner Keeps Inviting the Motel Goblins Back (and I‚Äôm Losing My Sanity),"I swear to God my motel owner loves drama. He has to at this point.

I took over management about three years ago. We‚Äôre a small boutique motel ‚Äî around 34 rooms and 3 off-site properties. The main courtyard takes up a whole block with four separate buildings. We‚Äôre in southern New Mexico, right on a hot springs aquifer ‚Äî so picture dirt, more dirt, roaches, and five indoor soaking baths üò≠.

This town? Full of absolute lunatics. Since we‚Äôre the cheapest motel around, we get everything from burned-out locals to wannabe spiritual healers who ‚Äúfelt called here by the springs.‚Äù Our only attractions are the hot springs and the lake, and somehow that‚Äôs enough to keep the chaos steady.

When I first took over, it was a disaster ‚Äî theft, mismanagement, party rooms, and long-term ‚Äúmonthlies‚Äù treating the place like their personal apartments. We‚Äôve cleaned it up so much. But the one thing we can‚Äôt fix?

The owner.
He‚Äôs 82 and believes every sob story that walks through the door.

Enter: Marissa.

This woman was the boss battle of problem guests. Entitled, manipulative, constantly flipping between calm and psychotic. Every few weeks she‚Äôd show up at the front desk, phone in hand, recording us while screaming that housekeeping didn‚Äôt ‚Äúrespect her schedule.‚Äù

Housekeeping has two designated days for monthlies ‚Äî they pick one. That‚Äôs it. We don‚Äôt do dishes, we don‚Äôt do laundry, and we don‚Äôt restock your paper towels or coffee anymore (thanks to her).

And don‚Äôt even get me started on guest laundry.
We had washers and dryers. Guests overloaded them, stole the soap, broke the machines ‚Äî and the owner refuses to buy commercial-grade replacements. So now we‚Äôve got regular household washers trying to handle motel volume. Spoiler: it doesn‚Äôt fucking work.

Back to Marissa ‚Äî she used to boss the housekeepers around like she was the CEO. She once tried to make them move 20+ tote boxes of her useless junk around her room. Girl, no. They‚Äôre here to clean, not play Tetris with your hoarding problem.

If housekeeping wasn‚Äôt at her door by 9:30 a.m. sharp, she‚Äôd start blowing up the front desk like her room was on fire.
Mind you, the housekeepers start at 9:30 ‚Äî they need time to prep their carts, not sprint to her beck and call.

One time, we were in the middle of a staff meeting ‚Äî announced and posted in advance ‚Äî and this woman storms into the meeting room screaming like she‚Äôs upper management. I told her point blank: ‚ÄúTake yourself back to your room. We‚Äôll get to it when we‚Äôre done.‚Äù

Of course, she has the owner‚Äôs personal number and loves to cry to him about ‚Äúneglect.‚Äù Like ma‚Äôam, we are not dropping everything because you need your royal suite vacuumed.

Thanksgiving weekend was the breaking point.
We were fully booked, phones ringing nonstop, and apparently she called while we were already helping another guest. Two minutes later she‚Äôs outside screaming into the courtyard, recording us again.

Why?
Because her remote batteries were dead.
I wish I was joking.

She‚Äôs told my assistant manager to kill himself, harassed guests across the property, and even picked fights with another long-term guest because his well-behaved dog sat on his porch. She‚Äôd deliberately walk her own dog past just to start drama, then call the cops claiming his dog ‚Äúattacked.‚Äù

Finally, I‚Äôd had enough. Told the owner: no more. We‚Äôre done with her, she‚Äôs banned, end of story. And we finally had peace for the first time in forever.

...Until this week.

Guess who‚Äôs coming back?
Yep. Marissa.

And why?
Because, and I quote, ‚ÄúWe need the money.‚Äù

At a discounted rate.

It depends... sometimes twice a month, sometimes only once. During summers it happened a lot...


Here‚Äôs my experience: sometimes I drink coffee (a really light one, just milk and sugar.) at night and go to bed 2/3/4 hours later, something strange happens. 

This whole thing starts within the first hour of sleep

I fall into these short but super vivid dreams, chaotic but not really nightmares. I wake up, feel insanely sleepy, and fall right back into another dream again. It keeps looping: dream, wake, dream, wake, until I get annoyed and tell myself as soon as i wake up... ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just get up, drink water, and walk for a couple of minutes.‚Äù And the moment I do that, the whole loop stops, and I instantly fall into deep sleep. I don‚Äôt get why it happens, how can my dreams be that vivid before the real REM period even starts?

It‚Äôs really hard to actually get up during these loops to drink water, since I only have about a 10 second window before I fall asleep again lol


What‚Äôs actually triggering this? Is it a bad sleep cycle, or am I just a coffee addict? (I'm not kidding when i say my coffee is really light)


I can say it‚Äôs not unhealthy, since I actually enter a really deep sleep after finally ending this loop and wake up after a full 8 hours without any interruptions.

Can I possibly trigger this intentionally? If yes, how, and should I try using it to lucid dream?

Do you love TONS of natural light, a private yard, and coziness galore? What about being a two-minute walk from Columbian Park and a 15-minute drive from Purdue?

1-bedroom ""bungalow"" available as of 11/9/25 due to an out-of-state move for a new job. Move-in date is negotiable. Depending on how quick it goes, an earlier move in might be possible. Apartment will be clean and move-in ready.

The unit is a ""mother-in-law suite"" that was added on to the main house and now functions like a duplex. It is roughly 650 square feet and has a private yard with fence, private entry, and a one-stall detached garage. It also has a spacious living area with floor-to-ceiling windows, a small bedroom with ample closet space, large kitchen, and a mudroom with washer & dryer (new as of December 2022, only ever used by me). Window A/C/heat combo in bedroom for coolness in the summer and extra heat in the winter. The bathroom is quirky: the sink and medicine cabinet are in the kitchen, but you get used to it quick, and the rest of the perks make up for it.

Rent is $1040 and includes $40 flat fee for water, sewer, and trash. Tenant is responsible for gas and electric. It is internet ready (Xfinity). Lease is pet-friendly with some extra fees, and there are some breed and age restrictions.

I have lived here for 3 years, and it has been wonderful. Maintenance is quick, and the landlord team is great. I have made a couple of furniture upgrades to the kitchen that I would be happy to leave behind for the next tenant as a housewarming gift, including extra cabinets and a microwave. If you don't want those, I'll sell them or give them to co-workers.

Points of interest:  
Purdue University - 15 minute drive  
Columbian Park - 2 minute walk  
Downtown Library - 15 minute walk  
Lafayette Farmer's Market - 15 minute walk  
Fuel Coffee - 10 minute walk  
Target / Walmart - 10 minute drive  
PayLess - 10 minute drive

**Leasing criteria:**¬†credit score of 600 minimum. Monthly income must be 3x rent. Credit, criminal, landlord, and employment check required before approval. Renters insurance is required. You will work with the leasing company, CNC Leasing, on all of that. I just need to find a new tenant, and they will take care of the rest. I've had a good experience with them thus far, in large part because they know how well I take care of my apartment.

They‚Äôre at the top of every menu. Cow‚Äôs milk is standard in every cafe. But what happens if you flip the default?

The [graph from Faunalytics](https://faunalytics.org/tactics-in-practice-the-science-of-plant-based-defaults-and-nudges/) shows what happens if the vegan option is the default option on a menu, with meat only available upon request, compared to the reverse. The effect on people‚Äôs choices is huge ‚Äì and we can see that non-vegans are a lot less motivated to eat meat at each meal than we might expect.¬†

Other evidence-based plant-based-default behavioural ‚Äònudges‚Äô include having more plant-based than meat-based dishes on the menu; moving plant-based dishes to the top of the menu and out of a ‚Äòvegan/vegetarian‚Äô section; and not calling them ‚Äòvegan‚Äô, ‚Äòvegetarian‚Äô, ‚Äòplant-based‚Äô, ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô or anything else that sounds grim/depriving but describing them in terms of their lovely flavors, textures, provenance and ingredients (e.g., ‚ÄúCuban Black Bean Soup‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúVegetarian Black Bean Soup‚Äù).

Vegan and vegetarian dishes are discreetly marked with symbols so that people can still see what they‚Äôre eating ‚Äì and the benefits for animals are huge, because animal consumption and animal harm is is being cut on a far larger scale than the tiny percentage of¬†vegans or vegetarians in our populations can achieve as individuals through their own dietary choices.

The US-based Better Food Foundation is the leader in promoting the use of behavioural ‚Äònudge‚Äô techniques like this to cut consumption of animal-based foods ‚Äì and they‚Äôre having enormous success. Due to their work, more than 500 institutions, businesses, and organisations now use plant-based nudge strategies in their catering. Because meat/dairy/fish/eggs stay on the menu ‚Äì though shoved into the corner ‚Äì there‚Äôs no reason for pushback.

We can [join in](https://www.betterfoodfoundation.org/join-us/) to help our colleges, universities, workplaces, hospitals, coffee shops and cities to go ‚ÄòDefault Veg‚Äô, with the support and [resources](https://www.betterfoodfoundation.org/resources/) of the BFF.

My (25F) friend invited me to her graduation party in mid-August, and one of her relatives was there, we'll call her Diana (25F). I was the only person who was not related to her who was invited to my friend's party. I interacted with Diana a little bit. At this graduation party, I found out Diana is bi, mainly because she was outed by her aunt. Anyways, I felt a certain way about Diana, and I found her social media, reached out to her there, asked her out for coffee/initiated planning the meetup, and got her number. We actually met up in late August, the meetup was 2 hours from both of us (we live 4 hours away). We had an 8 hour date (?), where we had food, walked around, and talked. I even came out to her. On this meetup, I learned/noticed that Diana 1) talks extremely quietly, even when we're walking around or eating 2) avoids eye contact 3) does not express emotions/has a ""flat affect"" (e.g. when she finds something funny, she hides her laughs) 4) has to be set up to date by her friends and 5) does not use her phone much. Also, while waiting for the food at the restaurants, she would bring out her diary/journal and would write in it, or read her book. This happened 3 times. Also, after she learned about my sexuality, she started talking to me more and asking me more personal questions.

So Diana is in a graduate program that involves a lot of reading and writing, and from my understanding, is working several jobs as well. Before we went out for coffee, she had finished her 2nd week of school. Since going out for coffee, I would text her, and she'd eventually started taking a while to respond. I kind of attributed this to maybe her feeling tired from her responsibilities. I was okay with the slower texts, as long she was texting me, answering my questions, and inquiring about me. Well, I ask her if she wants to do something together again, and I take the reins on planning. We decide to go to a classical music concert, in early October, and we each pay $90 for tickets. Basically, I also ask about if she wanted to do other things apart from the concert, and I make plans based on whatever she says we can do. 

So anyways, the concert date is approaching. Our texts are pretty slow and spaced out, but she brings up the concert and that she's excited for it. The day before the concert, though, I let her know about parking and other logistics planning stuff, and she's agreeing. I think everything is going fine, until she agrees to plans and then immediately says she's not feeling well (she had to leave work early) and that she may not be able to go to the concert. I'm a bit sad, but I decide to check-in on her the morning of the concert, and ultimately, she tells me she's not going to the concert because of how sick she feels, and that she wants me to enjoy the concert without her. I actually don't end up going, and the next day I get a text from her asking about the concert. I tell her very honestly I didn't go because I felt sad, and she apologizes. I divert the conversation to school, and she tells me she's struggling with school. 

Now, the last time we've texted was Wednesday night. It's Saturday and I'm still waiting for her text. I haven't told her how I feel about her (I really like her), and the last conversation was sort of about school. I hope things aren't over between us, but what are the next steps I could take?

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person. More simply? I want someone to casually chat with daily. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But I don‚Äôt have such lofty expectations of anyone ‚Äì including of myself. Let‚Äôs feel each other out to know what‚Äôs possible and what we‚Äôd like to see happen.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I‚Äôm designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, but am an adopter of voice chat, which I sometimes even prefer if I really vibe with someone.

In regards to aro/ace things, I'm a lifelong demisexual who's becoming less demisexual and more demiromantic with age. I'm also sapiosexual/romantic, graysexual online, and somewhat/increasingly aegosexual,

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it‚Äôs too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I‚Äôm an autodidact who‚Äôs been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I‚Äôve been young. I‚Äôm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I‚Äôm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

I‚Äôm struggling to find the proper start to this story. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly when everything started. Memories aren‚Äôt always linear and I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm piecing together a puzzle made of wrong pieces.¬†

However, this story has to be written. It has to be read.¬†

If not, I fear that all we went through will be for nothing.

In lieu of finding a beginning, I think it‚Äôs fair to say that this story begins at a restaurant called The Red Duck Cafe.

The Red Duck was a dive.¬†

It survived off of a steady stream of locals with an inclination towards alcoholism. Occasionally a bumbling tourist or a lost stranger would find their way into the dusty old bar, but it was the regulars who kept the lights on and the taps flowing. The only mixed drinks that were served were the kind with the recipe in the title. Tap beer was two dollars at happy hour and the entire place smelt like frying oil and cigarettes.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt the kind of place I frequented, but it was where my newest client had requested we meet at.

It was around seven o‚Äôclock when I found myself sitting at a table inside the bar. I waited patiently with a gin and tonic sitting in front of me. I watched the bubbles rise to the surface and pop, thinking about very little at all. The puddle of condensation around the glass grew by the second.

The bartender, an older man with a long beard, was the only other inhabitant of The Red Duck at that time. He stood behind the bar, cleaning the classes, wearing a rather bored expression. In the background an old Johnny Cash song played on the radio.¬†

When the door opened, a tall, dark-haired man walked into the bar. He glanced around with his hands in his pockets before his eyes fell onto me. He walked up to my table without any hesitation and sat down.

‚ÄúYou must be Alvaro,‚Äù I said as I offered my hand.

He shook it, ‚Äúcall me Varo,‚Äù he replied with a half-smile.¬†

His voice was rougher than I expected from a man his age. He couldn‚Äôt have been older than thirty-five, but his voice was harsh and weathered like the voice of someone much older and rougher.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Harper?‚Äù He asked when I failed to introduce myself.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúThanks for meeting with me,‚Äù Varo said as he stretched slightly. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs late, I work odd hours,‚Äù he explained. As he spoke, I noticed a strange scar across the side of his throat, it was white against his skin. I tried not to stare for too long.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no problem.‚Äù

Afterall, it¬†*was*¬†my job. It wasn‚Äôt so unusual to meet at odd hours with clients.

After a few moments, the bartender took Varo‚Äôs order and returned with a glass of whiskey. Varo sipped the drink, hesitating to tell me what it was that he was asking me to do.

After a moment of waiting I said, ‚Äúif you need someone found, you‚Äôre going to have to give me a little bit of information.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he nodded quickly, running his hand through his hair.¬†

He seemed nervous but I had to remind myself that not everyone is used to talking about people disappearing. Sometimes it was hard to talk about.

Varo finally met my eyes and asked, ‚Äúyou like Phoenix?‚Äù

I shrugged. So he was a small-talker. Great.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than a lot of places,‚Äù I said with a tone of passiveness. I didn‚Äôt really have much opinions on Phoenix. It was hot. There were lots of old people. What could I really say?

Varo nodded in response and sipped his drink. I hoped that the whiskey might help him get to the point.¬†

‚ÄúWhat kind of cases do you typically work on?‚Äù He asked after a moment of pause.

‚ÄúMinor things mostly,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúCheating wives, husbands with second families, that sort of thing‚Ä¶sometimes I‚Äôll work on a missing persons case, but that‚Äôs rare.‚Äù Being a private investigator was hardly as glamorous as it seemed on the big screen.¬†

Varo hesitated for a moment before saying, ‚Äúhave you found anyone? Like someone who went missing?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúA couple months ago a family hired me to find their son. I found him living with a bunch of other kids at some trap house outside of town. Before that, I was hired to find a man‚Äôs wife. She was across the country, living with an ex-boyfriend.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you find them?‚Äù

‚ÄúPhones, usually. They can be tracked easily, but sometimes people ditch their phones if they don‚Äôt want to be found.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what do you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I have access to their personal computer I might be able to narrow down the places they would go. People are pretty predictable for the most part.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if you can‚Äôt use their computer?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have my ways,‚Äù I said with a forced smile. After years of doing what I did, the idle job-talk was tiring. However, if I wanted Varo‚Äôs business, I needed to make him feel comfortable.

Varo didn‚Äôt return the smile. Whatever his situation was, he was clearly upset by it. Sweat beaded on his forehead and he continued to tap his fingers against his whiskey glass in a rhythmless tick.

‚ÄúMost people have a handful of locations that they would consider disappearing to.‚Äù I offered. ‚ÄúA vacation spot or a town they lived in before. Like I said, people are predictable. And they‚Äôre messy. Usually people slip up by paying for something with a credit card or contacting someone from their old life.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if someone was taken?‚Äù There was an intensity to his expression that led me to believe this was no longer a hypothetical.

‚ÄúIt gets more complicated,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs reason to believe that someone was abducted, usually the police get involved. Sometimes I can help, but ultimately I‚Äôm not law enforcement and I have my own restrictions.‚Äù

Varo looked genuinely disappointed to hear this explanation.

‚ÄúBut, it doesn‚Äôt mean that I can‚Äôt help.‚Äù I paused for a moment. ‚ÄúInstead of talking in hypotheticals, can you just explain what it is you want me to do?‚Äù

He let out a long sigh and scratched the back of his head, nervously. ‚ÄúMy sister stopped responding to my calls,‚Äù he said so quietly I almost didn‚Äôt hear him.

‚ÄúHow long ago?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo days.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould her phone be dead?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôs good with her phone. She never lets it die like that.‚Äù Varo seemed almost offended that I would ask such a thing.

‚ÄúWhat about being out of cell service, she‚Äôs not camping or anything, is she?‚Äù

The question brought a half-smile to his face. ‚ÄúNo, my sister isn‚Äôt the outdoor type.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid anything significant happen leading up to her‚Ä¶loss of contact?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to say ‚Äò*disappearance‚Äô*. At least not yet.

‚ÄúShe got into a heated argument with my mother. She left that night and I haven‚Äôt heard from her since.‚Äù There was a clear worry in his eyes, a look I knew all-too-well.

‚ÄúAre you asking me to find your sister?‚Äù

Varo hesitated before saying, ‚ÄúI am.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll need some information from you in order to do what I do,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start with her name, her address, and a cell phone number.‚Äù

I sat with Varo for a few hours at the Red Duck, learning about his sister, Luciana Delgado‚Äìwho went simply by Lu. She was a liberal arts student studying in Albuquerque. She had a few days off from school, so she went home to visit their mother in Las Cruces. It was shortly after that when she disappeared.¬†

‚ÄúWell be in touch,‚Äù I said to Varo as we walked out of The Red Duck together.

‚ÄúWhen should I expect to hear from you?‚Äù

‚ÄúResearch like this usually only takes a day or two. I should be able to track her phone until she lost coverage and hopefully learn more from there. I‚Äôll call you in less than two days.‚Äù

He nodded, still looking as nervous as ever. Typically at this point in a meeting, my clients would begin to calm down. Most people found it comforting to pass their stress to me. It was strange that Varo looked just on edge as ever as he walked towards his car. I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if there was something that he wasn‚Äôt telling me.

‚ÄúAnd Varo,‚Äù I called out before he could slip away into the night. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs hard but if there‚Äôs anything you forgot to tell me, please reach out. Even the smallest things can really help.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶text you if I think of anything.‚Äù

I dug into Lu‚Äôs case the moment I got home. At first, it seemed like a pretty straight forward case‚Äìthe kind of case I had worked on many times before.¬†

From what I found, Lu left Las Cruces, and eventually New Mexico as a whole. Somewhere on the other side of the Texas border, her phone had shut off. However, just before it lost signal, a singular call was made. The call had been made to a local towing company.

It wasn‚Äôt hard to find the towing company. It was the only one in a small town called Judgment, Texas. There were no pictures online nor was there an address listed. However, from the looks of Judgment, it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to find the towing company.

I walked into The Red Duck only to be met with the familiar smell of stale smoke and spilled beer. The bearded bartender gave me a quick glance before returning to his glass-cleaning.

‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt she have found a charger and recharged her phone by now?‚Äù Varo asked as I slipped into the booth seat across from him.¬†

Once again, we were the only two people in the bar. An old country song played out from the record machine. It sounded distorted and more echo-y than usual‚Äìbut maybe that was just the empty bar.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but the phone hasn‚Äôt been turned on since she called the towing company. I think it would be safe to assume that she had car problems and had to get a tow. Likely, she‚Äôs still in Judgment. It‚Äôs just a little east of the Texas border. It looks pretty remote, about an hour off the interstate, so it's possible she hasn‚Äôt been able to charge her phone.‚Äù

Varo gave a short, stiff nod. He looked even more uncomfortable than when I saw him before. He kept spinning his glass of untouched whiskey in a circle on the table. Dark bags were under his eyes and patchy stubble covered his jaw. Clearly, the disappearance of his sister was keeping him up.

‚ÄúI tried calling the tow company,‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúBut the call didn‚Äôt go through. The line was busy both times I called.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the hell would Lu drive an hour off the interstate to a random town,‚Äù Varo said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense that she would go that way.‚Äù

I gave a small shrug. Lots of family members failed to see the connections. ‚ÄúMaybe she has friends in that direction. Lots of young people go to friends‚Äô houses after an argument with their parents. Do you know her friends?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he admitted quietly. ‚ÄúBut I think she has friends who live closer than Texas.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call the towing company in Judgment once they open again,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Varo ran a hand through his hair and glanced around the bar. ‚ÄúBut I think I should just go down there myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you like someone to go with you?‚Äù I asked

Looking back, I have no idea why I offered that. I wasn‚Äôt friends with Varo and I didn‚Äôt know his sister personally. Sure, he was paying me, but I was a private investigator, not a bounty hunter. I rarely traveled with clients.

Despite this, there was an odd draw to the town of Judgment. I think I had started to feel this draw the moment I had searched its name. In the moment, however, I told myself I was being a good person‚Äìa good samaritan‚Äìby helping Varo find his sister.

Upon looking into the towing company Lu had called, I found that there was little information online about Judgment. So little, in fact, that it was boarding on suspicion. Why would a town not be labeled on Google Maps?

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre willing to go all the way to Texas?‚Äù His eyes met with mine and I knew I couldn‚Äôt take back my offer.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I would mind leaving Phoenix for a bit.‚Äù

Hearing what I offered, something in Varo‚Äôs demeanor shifted and he asked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay for the gas, lodging, and food, if you‚Äôd be willing to take your car.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds like a deal. I‚Äôve never been to Texas.‚Äù Or at least that was what I had thought at the time.

Less than twenty-four hours later, I picked up Varo from a dingy motel on the outskirts of the city. He tossed a black duffle bag into my trunk and climbed into the passenger seat. He rolled down the window the second he sat down.¬†

I apologized for the lack of AC, and he waved it off, asking if he could light a cigarette. I let him. I had never been a smoker myself but I didn‚Äôt mind the smell. Something about it reminded me of a time I couldn‚Äôt remember.¬†

Varo let a cloud of blue smoke out of his mouth as I accelerated into the interstate. According to my GPS, it would take nearly eight hours to reach Judgment. Varo and I had already agreed to take the drive in shifts. I would start us off, leaving Phoenix and heading south towards Tucson.

The radio played a rather mediocre playlist of the top 40s from the early 2000s. I wasn‚Äôt really listening to it, but the noise filled the silence between Varo and I.¬†

I didn‚Äôt know Varo well. Outside of discussing his missing sister, we hadn‚Äôt spoken much. Taking an eight hour road trip with a stranger wasn't exactly how I planned to spend my weekend, but I was interested to know about what the tiny town of Judgment held. I hoped we would be returning with Lu by the end of the weekend.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you expect your sister to say when we find her?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he blew out another cloud of smoke. It scattered across the dashboard like fog in a valley. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt expect her to be happy with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs none of my business but what was the fight between her and your mother about?‚Äù

Varo shrugged. ‚ÄúIt could have been anything. My mother is a devout Catholic, my sister is a liberal arts student.‚Äù he said.

I smirked. ‚ÄúHas she ever done something like this before?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe has a good group of friends in Las Cruces from what I hear. She fights with my mother sometimes but she never just leaves. Not like this. And not to a tiny town in Texas.‚Äù

I agreed it was odd. From everything he was saying, it didn‚Äôt add up. However, I had been investigating for long enough to know that one person‚Äôs perspective of something was always limited. There was likely something Varo was missing.

In Tucson, I gave up my position as driver in an attempt to sleep for a bit. Varo took over after we stopped at a truck stop. He drove back onto the interstate, lit a cigarette, and cracked open an energy drink. I gazed out my window at the dark desert skies.¬†

The mountains around Tucson couldn‚Äôt be seen in the dull light, but I was familiar enough with the area to know they were there.¬†

The interstate was illuminated in a way only an interstate could be. The lights of the cars reflected off of navigational signs and the freshly-painted lines in the road. There was something ethereal about the darkness that enveloped us. Anything or nothing could be out there and we would never see it.

I let my eyes close as I leaned back in my seat. I thought about the map we were following and the little dot which symbolized Judgment. It wasn‚Äôt long before a strange dream met me in my sleep.

*I was breathing hard, harder than I ever had in my life. Tears streaked my face and my feet were bloody, but I kept running. I ran across the rough, desert ground until I found pavement.*¬†

*I wanted to collapse there. Everything hurt. There was so much blood, too much blood. But I had to stay awake. I had to get help. I had to tell someone‚Äìanyone‚Äìwhat was happening to me.*

*I limped along the side of the highway, praying to the god that had abandoned me. I prayed for a car‚Äìfor a savior. I prayed for the blood to stop spilling from my wounds. I prayed for the pain deep inside of me to stop.*

*A bright flash in the distance made my heart leap. Someone was here. Someone was coming towards me. The car approached quickly, sailing through the dark night like a comet through the desert skies.*

*As it approached me, I waved, attempting to flag down the driver. Worried, it would fly past me, I stepped further into the road.*¬†

*The car didn‚Äôt stop until after it collided with my body.*

I woke up with a jump. Varo, who had been fumbling with his lighter, looked over at me.¬†

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said, not knowing if I had been having a dream or simply a memory. It was a weird sensation.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to pull off at the next gas station,‚Äù he said, ignoring my sudden jolt.

‚ÄúWhy? We just left that truck stop.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, like three hours ago. I have to piss.‚Äù

*Three hours*. It felt as though I hadn‚Äôt been asleep for longer than a few minutes.

I considered that in silence as he veered off the road and up an exit. Varo parked the car beside the building and left in a hurry. I remained seated. I didn‚Äôt have to go in and I certainly was in no mood to make small-talk with any other late-night travelers.

Varo walked back outside, pulling the hood of his sweater up over his head. He ducked into the car and backed out.¬†

‚ÄúHave you been to Texas before?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúI was born in Texas,‚Äù he said without explanation.¬†

‚ÄúReally? Why‚Äôd you leave?‚Äù I said.

He looked surprised by my question. ‚ÄúMy family moved,‚Äù he said simply. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much to see where we‚Äôre going. Just more desert.‚Äù He took a drink from his can.

I nodded, I had assumed as much. ‚ÄúDo you plan on stopping? I don‚Äôt mind driving again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI planned to stop in Las Cruces,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIs that alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs perfect. How far are we from there?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbout an hour.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you stopping to see your mother?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said quickly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll fill up and trade places again. I just want to make it to Judgment. I‚Äôll get us a hotel when we arrive there.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt argue. It made sense to me. Instead, I glanced out the window and began to wonder about Lu‚Äôs strange disappearance near Judgment.

Hours passed, eventually we made it to Las Cruces. Varo pulled into a gas station on the outskirts of town. I got out and stretched while he filled up the old car. I walked into the convenience store and bought myself a cup of coffee. The man at the counter stared at me in a way that made my stomach feel strange.

As I was attempting to swipe my card, he said, ‚Äúthey know you‚Äôre comin‚Äô. The Primores told them about your return.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúSorry, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúYa need to enter your pin,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I typed in my pin number, grabbed my coffee, and left.¬†

Despite the warmth of the air outside, there was something cold inside my gut. Something about the strange, nonsensical words from the clerk made me feel ill. For the first time, I began to question what I was doing. I pushed those feelings aside and told myself that I was just tired, that was all.¬†

I took over for the remainder of the drive. I sipped my coffee, realizing only then how terrible it was. ‚ÄòCoffee‚Äô was a pretty strong word for something that tasted like it had been filtered through a dirty sock.¬†

Beside me, Varo reclined his chair slightly and kicked his heavy boots onto the dashboard. I figured he would fall asleep like that but to my surprise his eyes remained open, focusing on the world outside the car.

For a while I drove in silence, assuming that Varo would eventually fall asleep.¬†

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you become a PI?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI went to college for criminal justice‚Ä¶I‚Äôve always been interested in that kind of stuff,‚Äù I said simply. ‚ÄúAfter school I decided to pursue a career as a private investigator. Learning the truth about things has always been important to me.‚Äù¬†

I was careful not to elaborate too much.¬†

He nodded. ‚ÄúDid you study in Arizona?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI actually lived in Denver for a while before I moved to Phoenix.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did you move?‚Äù

I hesitated before saying, ‚ÄúI had an‚Ä¶abnormal childhood. I don‚Äôt remember much of it‚Ä¶the doctors say it was amnesia. I moved to Denver as soon as I was old enough to leave foster care. After Denver, I found Phoenix and I guess I‚Äôve been there ever since.‚Äù

Varo said nothing for a long time. I wondered if I had over shared. Most people didn‚Äôt want to hear about foster care and childhood amnesia. It was really a bit of a mood killer.

‚ÄúThat sounds like a difficult childhood,‚Äù he said at last. I could feel his eyes on me as I drove.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I admitted. It was weird how the night could make you admit things you would never say in the day. ‚ÄúIf I couldn‚Äôt know the truth about what happened to me, then I wanted to at least help others know the truth.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you really don‚Äôt remember your childhood?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot before the age of about fifteen,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAt first, they told me my memories would resurface, but at this point, it‚Äôs been too long. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever remember who I was‚Ä¶where I was raised.‚Äù¬†

Typically, when I thought of the lost time, I felt very little at all. It was so long ago, I often couldn‚Äôt bring myself to grieve my memories. However, in the dim light of the car, I felt an unfamiliar pressure behind my eyes.¬†

It was as if the highway was hypnotizing me to¬†*feel*. I said nothing more about my past to Varo that night. And he didn‚Äôt ask anything more.

The sun was just a spark on the eastern horizon by the time we made it to the exit for Judgment. So far, Varo was right about western Texas, there wasn‚Äôt much to see.¬†

For the most part, it looked similarly to eastern New Mexico, an expanse of rugged hills. Small brush covered the ground in many areas, providing cover for all manner of desert wildlife. In the distance, mountains guarded the horizon.

The exit leading off the interstate was hardly an exit at all. The mile-marker sign had been run over. I only knew where to turn off because of the GPS I had programmed with Lu‚Äôs last known coordinates.

I followed the directions off the interstate and onto what looked to be a county road. However, much like the exit, it was unmarked. If this was a red flag, I wouldn‚Äôt have known it at the time. I was too busy feeling an overwhelming sense of indigestion, or at least that‚Äôs what I thought it was.¬†

My stomach churned as sweat began to drip down my back.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I need to pull over,‚Äù I said suddenly.

I swerved onto the shoulder of the road. Before Varo had a chance to respond, I put the car in park and practically launched myself out of my seat.¬†

I retched on the side of the road, grasping the car‚Äôs bumper for support. When I had finished, I found that Varo had gotten out of the car to check on me. He hesitated with a disgusted look on his face.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù again, I threw up.¬†

For once I was thankful for the desolate nature of the desert. No one drove by as the contents of my stomach were emptied onto the dusty road.

Without a word, Varo handed me a napkin. I accepted it with a nod of thanks and cleaned myself up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll drive for a little while,‚Äù he said as he walked to the driver's side and sat down. ‚ÄúJudgment isn‚Äôt far. Do you think you‚Äôll be alright until we stop again?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said as I collapsed into the passenger seat. ‚ÄúThat was weird. I‚Äôve never been sick like that from driving‚Äìit must have been the food.‚Äù

Gas station food didn‚Äôt exactly have the best rap. Likely, the burrito I had grabbed from our last stop had gone bad.

Varo pulled the car back onto the road without a word.¬†

‚ÄúSorry about that,‚Äù I said. It was hard not to be embarrassed.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt could be the elevation. Drink some water.‚Äù

The elevation didn‚Äôt seem like it would have changed much since Las Cruces. If anything, it would have made more sense for it to go down. However, I did as Varo suggested.

‚ÄúIf this town is as small as it seems, we shouldn‚Äôt have a problem finding your sister,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúHow small did it say it was?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs weird‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt look like there‚Äôs a town out here at all. I mean it‚Äôs not listed on Google Maps.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen how do you know it‚Äôs here?‚Äù

I gave a small laugh. ‚ÄúYellow pages. I looked up the number Lu had called and traced it to a towing company called Judgment Auto and Towing. They had nothing listed online other than their number. So, I ended up searching for anything with the name ‚ÄòJudgment‚Äô from around this area, that‚Äôs when I found it listed as a town.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs strange,‚Äù he said. His dark eyes were glued to the distant mountain on the horizon. ‚ÄúIt must be really small.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI guess. Or maybe it‚Äôs a bit of a ghost town.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt could happen. A lot of towns were built off of mining but when gold couldn‚Äôt be found, they sorta just‚Ä¶faded.‚Äù

I nodded. I knew all about ghost towns. Anyone who spent any time in the southwestern United States had heard about them. It wasn‚Äôt a stretch to say that Judgment was likely dying if not nearly dead. Possibly there weren't even enough people who lived there to warrant listing it as a true town.

‚ÄúAt the very least,‚Äù I began. ‚ÄúIt will be a place to start.‚Äù¬†

I stared at the dusty landscape and found it hard to think about a young woman willingly staying out there. What was Lu doing in a landscape like this? Would there even be a hotel to stay in?

I wondered about what I would find when we reached Judgment as I gazed out my window. After leaving the interstate, we had been steadily climbing in elevation. We were by no means in the mountains, but the elevation had been increasing slightly throughout the drive. It was possible that Varo was right and my sickness was caused by the climb.

The road was windy, but seemingly for no reason other than to be confusing. It wasn‚Äôt long before I found myself disorientated. We were going north? South? I was typically skilled with directions, but the sky had turned a hazy shade of white and I could no longer see the sun.

After about a half hour of driving, I saw a giant rock formation on the horizon. It wasn‚Äôt a mountain or a mesa, but rather a large monolith-like structure that rose from the earth like a finger pointed up. It was white instead of the sandy color of the earth.¬†

I felt an odd sensation in my chest and suddenly, I was overcome with a memory so vivid it felt like it was happening right then and there.

*I saw the light of day, but it was just a sliver of it.*¬†

*On my hands and knees I crawled toward the narrow exit of the coven. Rocks scraped my bare skin but I was determined to make it out. I had to make it out. Behind me, the cave echoed with a noise that made me sick, a dull clicking sound.*

*I crawled until I could pull myself out of the cave. My knees were bloody and bruised but I pushed on. The hole up ahead was barely large enough for me to fit through. Despite this, I stretched through it, shimmying and crawling like an animal in a trap.*¬†

*At last, I managed to get free. My palms were slick with blood as I pulled myself out of the hole in the earth and into the scorching bright light of day. A sob overtook me as I collapsed onto the ground.*¬†

*I gazed up at the giant monument that now towered over me.*

I came back to reality with a jolt, realizing that tears had been streaming down my face. The car was pulled off on the side of the road and Varo was staring at me with a strange expression. Worry creased between his brows as he watched me.

‚ÄúAre you alright? What the hell happened?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said as I breathed heavily. ‚ÄúI had‚Ä¶a memory.‚Äù¬†

I stared ahead at the giant stone monolith that took over the horizon. Deep dread settled in my chest.

‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶good?‚Äù He raised an eyebrow.¬†

I must have looked like a mess. A few minutes ago I was puking up my guts on the side of the road, now I was sobbing in the passenger seat.¬†*Some investigator I am*, I thought.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I think I‚Äôve been here before.‚Äù

A dark expression crossed Varo‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúIf you want, I can turn around and drop you off at the nearest town.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù I said, coming back to reality even further. I shook off the strange sensations. ‚ÄúThe nearest town is over an hour away. We‚Äôre so close. I‚Ä¶I think I might just be confused.‚Äù

With a bit of hesitation, Varo pulled back out onto the county road. I stared ahead.

‚ÄúWhat is that thing up there?‚Äù

‚ÄúA rock formation,‚Äù Varo said with a dismissive shrug.¬†

Despite his calm demeanor, I was drawn to his hands. They grasped the steering wheel with intensity. His tan skin looked white from the death-grip he had on the car.

I noticed that the road we were on was headed directly towards the monolithic stone. Varo could have been right. It could have just been a rock formation. However, I had seen Arches National Park and Monument Valley.¬†

While the giant stone ahead of us could have easily been a similar formation, there were no others around it. It was a lone rock, jutting into the skies. Its white stone looked unnatural against the dusty, tan landscape.

Despite the nausea in my gut and the strange memory I had, I told myself it was nothing. There was no possible way that I had been here before. This was far from where I had been found on the side of the road. I had never set foot in Texas let alone a strange desolate town called Judgment.

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person. More simply? I want someone to casually chat with daily. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But I don‚Äôt have such lofty expectations of anyone ‚Äì including of myself. Let‚Äôs feel each other out to know what‚Äôs possible and what we‚Äôd like to see happen.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I‚Äôm designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, but am an adopter of voice chat, which I sometimes even prefer if I really vibe with someone.

In regards to aro/ace things, I'm a lifelong demisexual who's becoming less demisexual and more demiromantic with age. I'm also sapiosexual/romantic, graysexual online, and somewhat/increasingly aegosexual,

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it‚Äôs too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I‚Äôm an autodidact who‚Äôs been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I‚Äôve been young. I‚Äôm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I‚Äôm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.
