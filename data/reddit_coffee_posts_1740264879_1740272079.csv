I'm M26 and there is a girl (F21) whom I love her. We work at same workplace. We are very good friends and comfortable in talking with each other. 4 months back I asked her out for dinner. She was fine for it but, made some excuses around why not on weekends or after office timings. I felt she clearly made some excuses to avoid. It's fine. Fast forward - till date I've asked her 3-4 times for other things like to drop off home, or grab a coffee in cafe, etc and got responses like she had to go somewhere, she has other plans etc.

Recently I came to know that within her friends circle she flaunts that I'm the guy who approaches her, some other people from workplace also approached her, etc. I've been observing that I'm the first one to initiate any thing in conversation. In-person in office she is the one who approaches to talk. Not sure if she is doing all this only for sake of attention.

From this community - I need help to understand in this situation what should I do. Should I detach myself from her and set boundary keep it a friendship level, nothing more than that ?

1ivxrxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACL/comments/1ivxrxp/right_knee_acl_reconstruction_surgery_post/,Right knee ACL reconstruction surgery post operation Day 9,"This is in reference to a Patellar Tendon  Anterior Cruciate Ligament replacement/reconstruction surgery, no other parts of the knee were messed with and are completely intact and in good health (wishfully). The doctor also gave me a PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) injection for the sake of healing well. The ACL was torn over a year and a half ago maybe even longer. I was able to adjust just fine without any real noticeable difference, except my other knee and other muscles were always compensating and I would feel the strain, however I could functionally run and maybe even play sports, never really attempted, but with careful consideration for movement I don't think it would be impossible. I decided to get the surgery to prevent any other damage to ligaments and return my knee to proper working function. The first three days were the hardest, Percocet was my absolute best friend, I am just wondering if I am doing everything wrong skipping all the benchmarks and being ignorant. I took the brace off after the first day, and started walking, more like limping, using mainly my right leg and muscles to carry most of the weight on my body. This worked until day 2-3 when all the nerve block wore off and I had to use another means to move around. I understand this is a costly tradeoff, a temporary one albeit and I don't think I can do that much damage in a few days of doing this. Never used crutches never attempted to learn after using them initially to get home from the surgery and having my left leg literally shake with strain, I did not even want to attempt them again.  I did receive a four legged walker however, which this cute nurse offered to throw in without cost. So for the next few days 2-6 I would use this four legged walker to move around, go to the bathroom and shower. Day 7 I still had some pain but was able to move around without the four legged walker while slowly applying some pressure to my right knee, this lead to me beginning to trust my knee in very limited positions. Knowing I would not push my current limits in attempting to run or even climb stairs rapidly. Even though I find know I can climb stairs if I only use my left knee to step up. I am on day 9 and I have been outside on my own twice for a very limited time to grab some coffee. I even drove once for 10 minutes, and did not feel overwhelming pain or safety concern, I find I can basically walk around with a slight limp that comes from me not wanting to over stress my knee with the weight and shifting the weight of my body to no greatly impact the step I make with my right knee. I also believe it is a result of my quad muscles being almost dormant, I also have well developed Cavs (I believe) which I tend to activate to make everything easier. Is this completely backward thinking? Or should I want to walk as much as I can without pushing anything and using pain as metered connection to notify me of when I am approaching the boundaries. Or should I be in bed not moving keeping my knee straight and using the crutches only to get where I need too. My first post op appointment is in two days and my first pt session is in three days. I have been using compression ice therapy, through this machine I got from amazon, its made a world of difference to the swelling pain and healing. I believe it's the reason I  I've recovered this fast. My knee flexion is just below 90 degrees, I've been working on slowly extending it and pushing past my limits, I've found recently that to push it past this applies pressure and pain to my quadriceps muscles (or anything maybe in the immediate area) not as much to the knee directly as it used to be to getting all the way up to this point, shortly under 90 degrees. Any sort of advice, disagreement, criticism is genuinely and unilaterally appreciated.

TLDR: I am walking by myself without crutches on the 9th day of surgery, trusting my knee only in certain positions, using my right legs and left Cavs as muscles to walk. Is this counter intuitive to this operation or is this exactly what I need to be doing. Currently at less than 90 degrees flexion and have only plateaued because of quadriceps pain when pushing it past this.",1,1740271594.0,ACL,0,1.0,False

1ivxr9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ivxr9m/what_i_wish_i_could_tell_my_brother/,What I wish I could tell my brother,"
My biggest failure has been raising my brother. It was role that didn't belong to me but one I tried to fill in the absence of a functional family. A role I didn't even realise I accepted; just something I attempted to do. 

I never thought they would treat you that way. I thought I was the problem, when I left for university I never intended to live under their roof again - I thought they had gotten tamer over the years. In some ways yes, but I was desensitized to what was normal. I was the scapegoat growing up; even when I was thriving and succeeding by whatever unrealistic expectation I was set; I was na√Øve to think my absence meant they would not shift that 'responsibility' onto you. It's not a burden a 5 year old should of carried - I'm sorry that I wasn't there to shield you from that. 3 years later when I returned from university; I say return, but I'd failed my degree, come back with my tail between my legs, pride humbled, future uncertain. What hurt me the most was the smile on your face was gone. I knew than but I couldn't admit it. I wasn't strong enough to face the truth that was staring me in the face.

I used to stop the arguments, I would take you to the park or to my friends house when I couldn't. I grew up watching our parents try to kill each other; I didn't want to be burdened with the same memories; but yours must of felt helpless, I used to try and stop them, throwing my body inbetween them so they wouldn't use the knives. At least I had some sort of feeble power or some sort of influence. I taught you to hide in the cupboard whilst I'd try to deescalate - or take you away if I couldn't. If I never left I think I could of let you have a few more years of childhood. I nearly stayed; our father wanted to clock out than, so I said I'd stay with you rather than go to university. He said he'd stay with our mother and you; I'm na√Øve, I believed that they had mellowed and the abuse I suffered was because they were young. Heck I didn't even realise I was abused. I've always known they didn't love me, but I thought they'd at least love you. 

Those 3 fucking years. I wish I knew what happened. You were too young to have lost your childlike confidence; some of the things you've told me still haunts me. But I don't know why you're still open to a relationship with them. Sometimes I feel like a shadow of my former self; I feel like I spent most my life fighting. I don't even like sharing some of the battles I'd faced, I'll find my peace with the past in my own way. Only thing I'll say is I didn't have good ways of coping before; the more I carried, the less energy I had, and the less energy I had, the less I had to be present with you at the time. I look back now, your cries for help were there. We can't change the past but I wish at the time you'd told me outright, trusted me. If you had, there was little I wouldn't of done. I misinterpreted the source of your pain; I was going to lock up my grievances deep down and play my part in the family if it meant you had a family system around you. Also I think as you grew older I expected you to be able to cope with more I suppose. In many ways I fell short but every now and than I mustered up enough of myself to give you advice on a way out. I'm not going to take credit since you put in the work; but I like to think I nudged you in the right direction here and there. 

You got angry with me, asking why I can't reconcile with our parents. That you are trying because you want to forgive them. I can see you might be able to; but I can't be part of it. I can't tell you my reasons since if I did, I don't think you could either. 

Our father was convicted of rape; he denies it to this day and blames our mother. I believe he did what he was convicted of; he molested me when I was younger; he had warped sense of boundaries but that aside I dealt with the abortion and emotional baggage that arose within our mother. I don't think you know about any of this, I hope not but you might have some patchy idea - but if anything I hope you know nothing of this and our mother didn't try and shift any of the blame on you somehow; it's what she does. He didn't answer my calls or texts when I begged him to pick you up from primary school - he did answer when I asked one of his friends to call and ask on my behalf. That was the first time in my life I'd begged someone for something.

When you started cutting yourself - shortly after I went to see our father for coffee. I wanted to let him know you were struggling, hoped as a family we could pull together but all I got was a 30 minute monologue about how hard his life was. I told him about you; he said I shouldn't worry about it and he can't do anything. Maybe I'm unreasonable for expecting him to do anything but he didn't contact me for years after that and decided that the best thing he could do was move half way across the country. You tell me I should forgive since he's a nice guy. I say, carry on accepting his money, that's all he has to offer you, he's showering you with money to alleviate his guilt. There are other things but what can I do. I'm not a perfect person and the anger I feel can't be forgiven with how I am now. All I know is that since I've gone no contact is when I've started to heal and process. 

We haven't spoke in 2 months now, you and I. I wish we could be in each others lives. You probably need me, but I need to be alone. I wish I was in a position mentally to offer what you need so you didn't have to go to our parents. But I have to be na√Øve once more; optimistic that you'll be ok. I just have nothing more to give, anyone, let alone you. The hypocrisy of ranting over an absent parent but I'm your brother not your father. Your as old as I was when I came back from university. You shouldn't be shackled by our family; you shouldn't feel responsible for any of our feelings - I'd be happy if you just go out there and focus on yourself rather than have a relationship with anyone in this broken family. Don't worry about me, I'll be ok - focus on yourself. I trust you'll be ok

Serendipity is a grossly underrated factor in life. I've been in Small Scottish Town for about 6 months now, and trawled the local bars about as many times.

Said Small Scottish Town has had a trajectory roughly representative of the whole. All the kids fled for the Big City at the first opportunity, the High Street had seen better days if not better highs. It was kept running mostly by pensioners, and middle-aged couples returning to their roots now that they wanted kids away from the hustle and bustle of urban life. It had about a ratio of 1:2000 bars per capita, down from a ratio of closer to *1:400* that was its absolute peak before Covid culled the herd. It was pure survival of the fittest, 27 bars brought down to four, or enough of the pensioners retired from drink by virtue of death. You can't buy a new set of clothes, but you sure can get still get drunk there. This is a story of how I did. 

I've been a good little boy for the duration of my stay in Scotland, and very rarely has the desire to haunt the local watering holes overtaken me. I had a shitty day at work, and the weekend beckoned, so I decided to stop by and have a drink. Perhaps two or three, as the mood took me.

I wandered up to a new pub, notable only in that a pint of Tenet's was half a pound cheaper than the last one I visited. As I approached the doors, I was greeted by a gaggle of regulars who had clearly popped out for a smoke. Notable among them were a lady who was well past inebriated and into loud drunk territory, and a bald and well-built gentleman, who if slightly past peak bouncer age, wasn't at the point it was unbelievable.

There I came, lugging a backpack full of random junk, NHS ID card flapping in the wind. I was just about to walk through the doors, when the lady accosted me and demanded that I show her my ID before I could enter.

This was eyebrow raising to say the least, the last time I was carded was back when I was 16, but I'm nothing if not long-suffering. I was just about to produce my government issued residency permit, a fancy piece of plastic that proclaimed with holographic probity that I was an alien with temporary reprieve in the nation, when she guffawed, embraced me in a bear hug, and explained that she was having me on. I laughed, and said that it's been a good while since I was asked to show ID, my haircut must have done wonders. 

Piss-takes are nothing unusual to me, and this town is isolated enough that it's avoided the transition of Britain into a Multicultural Nation, *exotic* would just about cover the handful of Polish expats and the odd Ukrainian refugee dwelling there. My color and complexion would scream *not from around these parts* regardless of whatever I said, and I didn't particularly care either way.  I'm just here to do my job, and potentially have a stiff drink when it's done.

I went through, relishing the temporary warmth and refuge from the chill. A pint of Tenet's please, to keep me warm and comfy in a country where the sun had just about deigned to stay visible in the sky when the clock struck five. 

I'd gotten halfway through my sorely needed drink when the lady who had had a laugh at my expense came in, and took her seat at the counter. She apologized for having me on, and when it was clear I'd handled it with good humor, began grilling me about who I was and what I was up to. 

I was happy enough to answer her endless queries. I'd been there for about 6 months and change. I was working in the psychiatric department of the hospital twenty minutes away, and was just about finished with that placement. She expressed surprise at the knowledge I was a doctor, but was interrupted by a friend of hers, another middle-aged lady with as many piercings and tattoos as she had years on me. 

It turned out that they all had the same bug-bear, namely the lack of doctors in the area. To translate further, a lack of *GPs*, the steadfast and underpaid bedrock on which the NHS stands. I commiserated with her, mentioning that I could certainly empathize with her, even with collegial congeniality and pulled strings, I had faced months long wait-times for my own medical concerns, and was aware that *years* was the norm when it came for waiting times for things that wouldn't kill you outright. 

Some more explanation followed, as I explained that no, doctors *are* allowed to sneak away for a drink at the end of the week, especially as I wasn't on the on-call rota for this weekend. 

This was met with hearty cheers, as an eminently sensible decision. I downed my first pint in pleasant company. I would have been content to watch the game show on the telly and nurse my drink, but the lady at the door decided to strike up further conversation.  I had nothing better to do, with only time spent grinding textbooks waiting for me back at home. 

Eventually, the conversation took unexpected turns. Tattoo Lady revealed that she was a born-again Christian, and expounded on her conviction that there was demonic influence running in the background, which compounded existing trauma and was a likely explanation for why several of her friends had been the victims of sexual violence. Not just once, but multiple times. 

This was a heavy subject, to say the least. I wisely opted for not challenging her beliefs in favor of a quick treatise on Internal Family Systems, a psychological framework for explaining mental illness that I, quite truthfully, explained believed in *literal demons*, unacknowleged trauma and personality shards (for a more prosaic explanation) being culpable. She helpfully drew up a PDF of an ebook she'd been planning to read on the topic, and even more helpfully, explained that she *hadn't* read it yet, except for the cover blurb. 

At this point, Bouncer Lady wanted to know more about me and what I was up to, I explained that I was a psychiatry trainee at the hospital further down the road. She began talking about her son, a Nurse Practitioner down in London, and how overworked the poor guy was, having to hold two bleeps at night. I commiserated, and said I hoped he was holding up well. She opened his Facebook profile, and showed a picture of him to me. I quite truthfully said he was a handsome guy, and that he took after his mum in that regard. 

With the bottom of her glass now visible, she went on to confide in me that he was gay. I didn't visibly react, beyond an *oh*, but did go on to ask if that had been difficult for him, given he'd grown up in Small Town. 

She said it had, though she and her family had been nothing but supportive. He'd been bullied quite badly in school, but had pulled through and was doing much better since he went to uni. She went on to complain that he no longer told her about the men he was seeing, especially since a solicitor boyfriend had rung her up when they'd broken up, and had threatened to commit suicide if he didn't come back to him. Then came an anaesthesist, who had sounded lovely, but had worried the lady sick when she fretted about him dosing her darling boy with all kinds of knockout drugs. 

I knew enough of the gay lifestyle down south to know that party poppers and all kinds of illicit substances were likely, but kept that to myself. I told her that I hadn't actually met any gay doctors since coming here, but she grumbled that it seemed to her that half of them batted die the other team, at least according to her son. 

She told me about the flat he had gotten a killer deal on, in London, and asked me where I was staying in town. I told her that I was renting, and that I lived with X and Y, a couple, expecting them to be recognized since the town was small enough that everyone knew everyone else. 

Her face shriveled up like a prune, like she'd bitten a lemon. ""They're bad people! You need to move away!"" 

I expressed surprise. They'd been quite nice to me, and besides, I was moving in a month or so to the big city (by local standards). 

She sounded relieved to hear that, but then went on to ask me about my rent. 700 pounds a month, I said. 

And what did I get for that, she asked? The front half of the property?

Nope, just a room. A large bed, a now defunct mini-fridge, a closet and a TV the size of my palm that I'd never used. She gasped in shock, and went on to explain that at the price I was paying, I could have had a whole house! She began calling over to the other denizens of the rapidly filling bar, asking them if they agreed I was being ripped off. A chorus of *ayes* came back.

At this point, she was drunk enough that she began saying that I was clearly a student, like her son, and it was terrible I'd been taken advantage of in that manner. I tried to explain that while I'm a trainee, I actually am a fully qualified doctor and that I do, in fact, get paid. Not as much as I'd like, but I have little in the way of expenses. These words fell on deaf (and drunk) ears.

She began offering that I move in with her, she told me she had a large house with 5 empty bedrooms, and that it was a sheer waste to have them lie empty while I paid out my arsehole elsewhere for nothing. I said that was far too kind of her, but I was locked in anyway, and would have to move.

At this point, she had another half a pint down the gullet, and began elaborating on why my landlords were *bad* people. Did I know they were *swingers*?? Had they ever propositioned me?? 

I reacted by straightening up, a dozen things I'd paid no need to clicking into place in my head. But no, I said, I hadn't known, and I don't think they ever asked me to join in their bed! 

She sniffed, saying she was surprised. Then she asked me if I was married. I said, not yet. No kids either? Not that I know of! 

Well.. Her son might well be single and coming by soonish.. 

Uh.. I'm straight as an arrow, last time I checked. I joked that I appreciated the offer, but I'm sure I'd be lynched by all the girls in town who languished in a state of dejection after they'd found out he was gay. She still demanded I move in, as she felt personally affronted by the violation of Scottish Hospitality that my landlords had engaged in, preying on a foreigner who hadn't known better. 

I told her I hadn't had much in the way of choices, as the only other listing on Spare Room had been a dingy attic room halfway to nowhere, for 550 pounds to boot. When weighed against the competition, I felt like 700 for a property closer to the center of town wasn't too much to ask for. 

I'd been bought a round of drinks, and then ordered one myself. I found myself checking Tattoo Lady's nose after she complained it always felt congested, and asked her if she'd ever been checked for a deviated nasal septum. No, came the answer, but she had poked a hole in it by doing too much coke in her teens. 

Those were the days, she said, when the stuff wasn't cut and didn't have a decent chance of killing you. I agreed, and revealed I'd once done a bit of Bolivian Nose Candy in a nightclub bathroom. I'd already been challenged on if it was alright for me to drink and vape as a doctor, and this went by uncontested. Who hasn't had a dissolute youth? 

The tattooed lady said she'd been clean for decades, and tried to keep the local kids straight, not that they'd listen. She then went on to talk about her struggles with bipolar disorder, and how she felt that she was often treated in a very dismissive way by *women*, with particular opprobrium from the typical nosy receptionist demanding to know more clinical details just for the sake of gossip. Remember, this is a really small town. She went on to praise a few of the local doctors, though half of them had seemingly retired by the time I came into the picture. She bemoaned the fact that these days, nobody really had the time to *talk*, and I tried to explain that the NHS, in its wisdom, tries to screen aggressively in an effort to avoid being overwhelmed, and the higher you go, the less time you'll have with progressively more qualified people. 

At about this point, I find out that the lady who just took over tending the bar works at the local medical practice. I ask her not to divulge my drinking habits, and she winks and say she won't tell if I don't. I go on to tell tall tales about how, when I'd visited the pub close to the nearest care home, I'd almost been confident that a few of the people drinking merrily were residents with dementia who really ought not to have been consuming alcohol alongside their meds. This was mostly an exaggeration, as the only confirmed sighting was a gentleman who had been seen as an outpatient with early dementia, and his meds were only *cautioned* when drinking. 

I made more smalltalk, enjoying a rare opportunity to observe the locals in the natural environment. I even learned a few things about cultural norms, such as how in those parts, overt displays of affection had been considered unseemly until quite recently. One of the ladies complained about how her elderly father only replied with a gruff *that's nice* when she told him she loved him. A shame, but the younger generations were better about these things. 

I preened internally at some rather effusive praise. I was told I was a model doctor, and that the ladies had gotten a ""good vibe"" off me from the start, and felt they could open up. I'm not sure how much of that was due to my usual politeness and ability to seem like I was intently hanging on to every word people tell me while my mind wanders, and how much of it was the beer. But I'll take what I can get. 

The lady who had offered to take me in wouldn't let up. I asked if she had a partner, experience in these parts telling me it was a more polite approach as compared to assuming someone was married. She told me her husband was a darling and wouldn't say a word if she insisted. I politely reiterated that I'd be quite happy to pay, and any sum below 700 quid was fine by me. She wouldn't hear it. I insisted that she at least talk to the gentleman, and reconsider it when sober, but this hurt her pride, and she puffed up and told me that her word was her bond, regardless of blood-alcohol content. Her tattooed friend nodded reassuringly. 

At this point, she insisted it was time to go home, though her friend cajoled her to stay for another round. I snuck in the opportunity to pay for it. In response, she perked up and said that even if I didn't pay a penny, I could cover drinks and make tea as a way of paying my way. I said I was more than happy to do the former, and already was, as a small token of appreciation for letting me know how badly I was being ripped off, but as to the latter, if she expected me to cook she'd better lower her standards and be ready for food poisoning. 

She assured me I couldn't be *that* bad, could I? 

At any rate, she said she was going home, and invited me to come with, so that I could scope out ""my"" room. I said that the gentlemanly thing to do would be to walk her home, and I would be happy to have a word with her husband if he was in. 

Along the way, she stopped at a nearby convenience store and asked if I wanted anything to drink. I demurred, but she insisted on picking *something*, and I said I'll have whatever she's having. There was a bit of a faff at the counter as her phone's contactless payment app asked her to scan her face first, something she was too far gone to manage. I was about to pull up my own card when she figured *something* out, and I grabbed the bag loaded with wine and soft drinks. It was evident that cashiers were well accustomed to handling the drunk and rowdy, I asked if another Indian I'd met there still worked at the place, but was informed he'd moved to Spain. Lucky bugger. 

We went the same route I'd normally take, her house was just a street over. It's a good thing I came along, because she was far from steady on her feet. Along the way, she said something that explained her distaste for my current hosts better than just her dislike of their lifestyle could. It turned out that my landlord's brother had knocked up her sister, and that her family had been embroiled in a lawsuit to establish paternity. This had been before quick and easy DNA testing, and they hadn't been able to win. The father's family had never accepted the kid, but he was older than me now and doing perfectly fine for himself. The rest of the walk was otherwise uneventful, barring her rehashing previous conversation while drunk to the gills. 

We came to her property, which I must say is lovely. She let us in, and I was greeted by a small shih tzu, wagging its tail away as I scratched him under the chin. She called over and asked if liked dogs. 

Love them, I said. And it's absolutely true, though my preference leans towards larger breeds. This one seemed nice, if yappy, and was happy to do laps around his mistress while she called it all kinds of incredibly derogatory names in a most endearing fashion. 

She showed me around, introducing my putative sleeping space with the same enthusiasm as a stage magician or the show runner in a Monty Hall problem. It wasn't terrible, nary a goat nor a super car in sight. A little cramped, but for the price of free this beggar isn't choosy. I was offered the run of the place, though if my present habits are any precedent, I hardly come out of my room. 

She produced a bottle of wine and began pouring us a glass each. I asked her where her husband was, and she said he was down the street, visiting his mother, who wasn't doing too well. She tried calling him, but he didn't pick up, so she ended up FaceTiming another woman. 

A quick recap followed, and when she turned the phone over to me, I genuinely thought I was talking to her daughter and asked the same. She laughed, saying she was her best friend, but I could tell she was pleased. Accidental flattery will get you anywhere, I say. 

She had some kind of role in the educational system, and expressed her frustration at the severe issues she ran into trying to get several kids assessed for learning difficulties. I mentioned that I had ADHD myself, and part of my interest in psychiatry arose from a desire to help out people in a similar boat. I explained that it had taken me *three months* to get assessed even with other medical professionals pulling strings out of collegiality, but that it dismayed me that kids could go years and grades without assessment and much needed help. 

At this point, my would-be host asked if we'd like to step outside for a smoke. I accepted a cigarette, too drunk to particularly hold myself to my usual abstinence, and we went out into their large, but dimly lit garden. She had music playing, and I began to feel growing consternation as she began dancing with me, drawing my hand to her waist and then tugging it lower. She was drunk enough that I didn't face much issue in carefully avoiding it, and once cigarettes burned out, came back in her wake, making sure to close the doors and keep the draft out. 

She excused herself, and ran to the toilet and proceeded to relieve herself with the door open. This was *awkward*, to say the least, and I settled for standing a good distance away and politely pretending I didn't hear her coughing either. I eventually got concerned enough that I asked if she was okay, and was told she was fine, it's just that cigarettes hadn't agreed with her. 

She came out, properly dressed, thank god. She asked me if I'd like a coffee, and I agreed, but insisted on making it for the two of us. At this point in time, her phone rang, and I could hear her husband on the other end, saying he was walking home. 

I'd just about finished up the coffee when he came in, heralded by the dog's barks, and didn't seem *too* surprised by my presence. I believe that at some point she'd mentioned that they'd had a guest over. I introduced myself, and he seemed like a decent sort, turning out to be a manager of several offshore oil rigs. 

She revealed that she ran a wedding boutique, one I'd walked past while on my way to my last haircut. I take back what I said about purchasing clothing not being an option in Small Scottish Town, at least if you're a bride-to-be. 

I apologized for the rather irregular situation, explaining that while I greatly appreciated the kindness his wife had offered me, I felt that I couldn't take advantage of her in her current state, and certainly not without running it by the other relevant stakeholder, her husband (the dog seemed pleased by my company). He seemed entirely fine with it, or at least was too polite to tell me to scram. I guess his wife did have a point about him going along with her suggestions. 

His wife interrupted my excuses by saying that it was *fine*, she wasn't just bringing someone in from the street, was she? 

I pointed out that she had, in fact, brought me in from the street. Or at least that's where we'd met before I had passed the shit-test and grabbed a drink. 

At any rate, I think I had been polite enough while trying to decline the offer, and said I'd give the two of them time to think it over. I assured them that there would be absolutely no hard feelings if they changed their mind, and I would probably figure something out in terms of a place to live regardless. If I'd been paying 700 a month for this long, it was clearly within my budget. 

I walked back home, and that was that. I probably might take them up on it, assuming that the passage of time and the elimination of liquor doesn't prompt second thoughts on their end. 

Inside, I was more than a tad bit thankful that four pints hadn't addled my senses, and that her husband hadn't walked in to find us in flagrante delicto, not that I had been interested. 

Nice people, the Scots, and at their best when you and they have comparable amounts of alcohol in your system. ",1,1740271524.0,redscarepod,0,1.0,False

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.¬† I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1ivxqnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ivxqnt/my_aunts_revenge_on_her_ex/,My aunt's revenge on her ex,"My (19) aunt ('Nana', 42) is probably the coolest person I have ever known. She is cool, she loves to bring gifts (especially for me, her favourite niece) and, most importantly. She is a petty woman.

She's had a few partners before her now husband (aka the second best uncle ever), though I never met most of them because, well. I was not even formed in the womb yet. My mom has met them, and she liked most of them. Most.

Here comes 'Wade'. At the time, my aunt was 29, and he was 30, openly bi, like he had a . No worries, aunt Nana is also bi. I was a toddler at the time they dated, never met him. It was a short relationship, from what my mom told me. He was a barista at a small coffee shop from my aunt's city (she lives in another city, far away, hence to why I never met him). They bonded over the same series. Two weeks later, aunt Nana asked him out on a date. She's a very direct woman, so she goes for what she wants. He accepts her offer, they go on a date, and then they go on three more before they start dating.

He was pretty chill. And they had a pretty nice relationship. Then he cheated. Some coworker from the shop. Aunt Nana found out because when she got to his apartment, while Wade was on the shower, the coworker was there. He was sitting on the sofa while listening to music. They both pointed at each other like the Spiderman meme image before aunt Nana decided to say 'fuck it, we're out', and they left.

Now, that would have been the end of the story. And it was. From what my mom told me, of course, because aunt Nana never told her the end. So me, being the curious soul I am, phoned aunt Nana and asked her what happened after. I heard a laugh from the other line when I asked the question, so I could already tell that it was gonna be interesting.

Aunt Nana interrogated the coworker for the details. He was 27, new to the job, and had no idea Wade was dating her until he got an invite to the apartment for the giggity, as Charlotte calls it. He saw her lingerie, which was the reason she had come to the apartment, and had a thought that maybe he had an actual, romantic, serious partner. Then Wade told him ""no, I just hook up with random people I meet at pubs and at the coffee shop. I don't do relationships. They're tedious.""

So the guy is chill. And then aunt Nana came and he realized that his thoughts were right and that the woman was Wade's girlfriend. So what does aunt Nana do? She gives him some sweet karma.

The apartment was small. Bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, simple necessities. Aunt Nana was the one who payed for it, Wade paid her rent, that's how it worked. So what she did was she put the apartment on sale when Wade was out on a trip with his mates, some bachelor party that aunt Nana had no clue about. She lived with her brother while the apartment was getting sold. She also blocked Wade's number after he left so there was no way he could contact her.

A week later, he shows up at her place, fuming, heaving for air, face red. She said, and I quote: ""His face was so red, I thought he was running a marathon he could never even reach until the first half."" He demands her to let her stay because she sold the apartment without his knowledge. She denies. Because this is her brother's place, he owns the house. There's a screaming match (although it's more him screaming and her talking calmly) and then she ends up saying ""you should have thought twice before cheating on me."" she shuts the door on him and just sits on the couch. She can hear him screaming at her, but she just ignores it and cranks the TV volume to nearly the max just to shut him up.

Uncle comes back, and Wade ends up screaming at him. No idea what happened, because aunt Nana had the volume tuning out the yelling. And when uncle entered the house, all she got was ""your ex is being a child. Ignore him.""

Best part? That wasn't the only thing she did.

Uncle lives at the other side of the city, so his home is pretty far from the apartment. Why was Wade so red and puffy and heaving? She ended up filling his car seats and his fuel tank with glitter. And he couldn't get it to work. So he ran all the way to uncle's house.

Aunt Nana is a delightfully petty woman and I strive to be like her.",2,1740271490.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Serendipity is a grossly underrated factor in life. I've been in Small Scottish Town for about 6 months now, and trawled the local bars about as many times.

Said Small Scottish Town has had a trajectory roughly representative of the whole. All the kids fled for the Big City at the first opportunity, the High Street had seen better days if not better highs. It was kept running mostly by pensioners, and middle-aged couples returning to their roots now that they wanted kids away from the hustle and bustle of urban life. It had about a ratio of 1:2000 bars per capita, down from a ratio of closer to *1:400* that was its absolute peak before Covid culled the herd. It was pure survival of the fittest, 27 bars brought down to four, or enough of the pensioners retired from drink by virtue of death. You can't buy a new set of clothes, but you sure can get still get drunk there. This is a story of how I did. 

I've been a good little boy for the duration of my stay in Scotland, and very rarely has the desire to haunt the local watering holes overtaken me. I had a shitty day at work, and the weekend beckoned, so I decided to stop by and have a drink. Perhaps two or three, as the mood took me.

I wandered up to a new pub, notable only in that a pint of Tenet's was half a pound cheaper than the last one I visited. As I approached the doors, I was greeted by a gaggle of regulars who had clearly popped out for a smoke. Notable among them were a lady who was well past inebriated and into loud drunk territory, and a bald and well-built gentleman, who if slightly past peak bouncer age, wasn't at the point it was unbelievable.

There I came, lugging a backpack full of random junk, NHS ID card flapping in the wind. I was just about to walk through the doors, when the lady accosted me and demanded that I show her my ID before I could enter.

This was eyebrow raising to say the least, the last time I was carded was back when I was 16, but I'm nothing if not long-suffering. I was just about to produce my government issued residency permit, a fancy piece of plastic that proclaimed with holographic probity that I was an alien with temporary reprieve in the nation, when she guffawed, embraced me in a bear hug, and explained that she was having me on. I laughed, and said that it's been a good while since I was asked to show ID, my haircut must have done wonders. 

Piss-takes are nothing unusual to me, and this town is isolated enough that it's avoided the transition of Britain into a Multicultural Nation, *exotic* would just about cover the handful of Polish expats and the odd Ukrainian refugee dwelling there. My color and complexion would scream *not from around these parts* regardless of whatever I said, and I didn't particularly care either way.  I'm just here to do my job, and potentially have a stiff drink when it's done.

I went through, relishing the temporary warmth and refuge from the chill. A pint of Tenet's please, to keep me warm and comfy in a country where the sun had just about deigned to stay visible in the sky when the clock struck five. 

I'd gotten halfway through my sorely needed drink when the lady who had had a laugh at my expense came in, and took her seat at the counter. She apologized for having me on, and when it was clear I'd handled it with good humor, began grilling me about who I was and what I was up to. 

I was happy enough to answer her endless queries. I'd been there for about 6 months and change. I was working in the psychiatric department of the hospital twenty minutes away, and was just about finished with that placement. She expressed surprise at the knowledge I was a doctor, but was interrupted by a friend of hers, another middle-aged lady with as many piercings and tattoos as she had years on me. 

It turned out that they all had the same bug-bear, namely the lack of doctors in the area. To translate further, a lack of *GPs*, the steadfast and underpaid bedrock on which the NHS stands. I commiserated with her, mentioning that I could certainly empathize with her, even with collegial congeniality and pulled strings, I had faced months long wait-times for my own medical concerns, and was aware that *years* was the norm when it came for waiting times for things that wouldn't kill you outright. 

Some more explanation followed, as I explained that no, doctors *are* allowed to sneak away for a drink at the end of the week, especially as I wasn't on the on-call rota for this weekend. 

This was met with hearty cheers, as an eminently sensible decision. I downed my first pint in pleasant company. I would have been content to watch the game show on the telly and nurse my drink, but the lady at the door decided to strike up further conversation.  I had nothing better to do, with only time spent grinding textbooks waiting for me back at home. 

Eventually, the conversation took unexpected turns. Tattoo Lady revealed that she was a born-again Christian, and expounded on her conviction that there was demonic influence running in the background, which compounded existing trauma and was a likely explanation for why several of her friends had been the victims of sexual violence. Not just once, but multiple times. 

This was a heavy subject, to say the least. I wisely opted for not challenging her beliefs in favor of a quick treatise on Internal Family Systems, a psychological framework for explaining mental illness that I, quite truthfully, explained believed in *literal demons*, unacknowleged trauma and personality shards (for a more prosaic explanation) being culpable. She helpfully drew up a PDF of an ebook she'd been planning to read on the topic, and even more helpfully, explained that she *hadn't* read it yet, except for the cover blurb. 

At this point, Bouncer Lady wanted to know more about me and what I was up to, I explained that I was a psychiatry trainee at the hospital further down the road. She began talking about her son, a Nurse Practitioner down in London, and how overworked the poor guy was, having to hold two bleeps at night. I commiserated, and said I hoped he was holding up well. She opened his Facebook profile, and showed a picture of him to me. I quite truthfully said he was a handsome guy, and that he took after his mum in that regard. 

With the bottom of her glass now visible, she went on to confide in me that he was gay. I didn't visibly react, beyond an *oh*, but did go on to ask if that had been difficult for him, given he'd grown up in Small Town. 

She said it had, though she and her family had been nothing but supportive. He'd been bullied quite badly in school, but had pulled through and was doing much better since he went to uni. She went on to complain that he no longer told her about the men he was seeing, especially since a solicitor boyfriend had rung her up when they'd broken up, and had threatened to commit suicide if he didn't come back to him. Then came an anaesthesist, who had sounded lovely, but had worried the lady sick when she fretted about him dosing her darling boy with all kinds of knockout drugs. 

I knew enough of the gay lifestyle down south to know that party poppers and all kinds of illicit substances were likely, but kept that to myself. I told her that I hadn't actually met any gay doctors since coming here, but she grumbled that it seemed to her that half of them batted die the other team, at least according to her son. 

She told me about the flat he had gotten a killer deal on, in London, and asked me where I was staying in town. I told her that I was renting, and that I lived with X and Y, a couple, expecting them to be recognized since the town was small enough that everyone knew everyone else. 

Her face shriveled up like a prune, like she'd bitten a lemon. ""They're bad people! You need to move away!"" 

I expressed surprise. They'd been quite nice to me, and besides, I was moving in a month or so to the big city (by local standards). 

She sounded relieved to hear that, but then went on to ask me about my rent. 700 pounds a month, I said. 

And what did I get for that, she asked? The front half of the property?

Nope, just a room. A large bed, a now defunct mini-fridge, a closet and a TV the size of my palm that I'd never used. She gasped in shock, and went on to explain that at the price I was paying, I could have had a whole house! She began calling over to the other denizens of the rapidly filling bar, asking them if they agreed I was being ripped off. A chorus of *ayes* came back.

At this point, she was drunk enough that she began saying that I was clearly a student, like her son, and it was terrible I'd been taken advantage of in that manner. I tried to explain that while I'm a trainee, I actually am a fully qualified doctor and that I do, in fact, get paid. Not as much as I'd like, but I have little in the way of expenses. These words fell on deaf (and drunk) ears.

She began offering that I move in with her, she told me she had a large house with 5 empty bedrooms, and that it was a sheer waste to have them lie empty while I paid out my arsehole elsewhere for nothing. I said that was far too kind of her, but I was locked in anyway, and would have to move.

At this point, she had another half a pint down the gullet, and began elaborating on why my landlords were *bad* people. Did I know they were *swingers*?? Had they ever propositioned me?? 

I reacted by straightening up, a dozen things I'd paid no need to clicking into place in my head. But no, I said, I hadn't known, and I don't think they ever asked me to join in their bed! 

She sniffed, saying she was surprised. Then she asked me if I was married. I said, not yet. No kids either? Not that I know of! 

Well.. Her son might well be single and coming by soonish.. 

Uh.. I'm straight as an arrow, last time I checked. I joked that I appreciated the offer, but I'm sure I'd be lynched by all the girls in town who languished in a state of dejection after they'd found out he was gay. She still demanded I move in, as she felt personally affronted by the violation of Scottish Hospitality that my landlords had engaged in, preying on a foreigner who hadn't known better. 

I told her I hadn't had much in the way of choices, as the only other listing on Spare Room had been a dingy attic room halfway to nowhere, for 550 pounds to boot. When weighed against the competition, I felt like 700 for a property closer to the center of town wasn't too much to ask for. 

I'd been bought a round of drinks, and then ordered one myself. I found myself checking Tattoo Lady's nose after she complained it always felt congested, and asked her if she'd ever been checked for a deviated nasal septum. No, came the answer, but she had poked a hole in it by doing too much coke in her teens. 

Those were the days, she said, when the stuff wasn't cut and didn't have a decent chance of killing you. I agreed, and revealed I'd once done a bit of Bolivian Nose Candy in a nightclub bathroom. I'd already been challenged on if it was alright for me to drink and vape as a doctor, and this went by uncontested. Who hasn't had a dissolute youth? 

The tattooed lady said she'd been clean for decades, and tried to keep the local kids straight, not that they'd listen. She then went on to talk about her struggles with bipolar disorder, and how she felt that she was often treated in a very dismissive way by *women*, with particular opprobrium from the typical nosy receptionist demanding to know more clinical details just for the sake of gossip. Remember, this is a really small town. She went on to praise a few of the local doctors, though half of them had seemingly retired by the time I came into the picture. She bemoaned the fact that these days, nobody really had the time to *talk*, and I tried to explain that the NHS, in its wisdom, tries to screen aggressively in an effort to avoid being overwhelmed, and the higher you go, the less time you'll have with progressively more qualified people. 

At about this point, I find out that the lady who just took over tending the bar works at the local medical practice. I ask her not to divulge my drinking habits, and she winks and say she won't tell if I don't. I go on to tell tall tales about how, when I'd visited the pub close to the nearest care home, I'd almost been confident that a few of the people drinking merrily were residents with dementia who really ought not to have been consuming alcohol alongside their meds. This was mostly an exaggeration, as the only confirmed sighting was a gentleman who had been seen as an outpatient with early dementia, and his meds were only *cautioned* when drinking. 

I made more smalltalk, enjoying a rare opportunity to observe the locals in the natural environment. I even learned a few things about cultural norms, such as how in those parts, overt displays of affection had been considered unseemly until quite recently. One of the ladies complained about how her elderly father only replied with a gruff *that's nice* when she told him she loved him. A shame, but the younger generations were better about these things. 

I preened internally at some rather effusive praise. I was told I was a model doctor, and that the ladies had gotten a ""good vibe"" off me from the start, and felt they could open up. I'm not sure how much of that was due to my usual politeness and ability to seem like I was intently hanging on to every word people tell me while my mind wanders, and how much of it was the beer. But I'll take what I can get. 

The lady who had offered to take me in wouldn't let up. I asked if she had a partner, experience in these parts telling me it was a more polite approach as compared to assuming someone was married. She told me her husband was a darling and wouldn't say a word if she insisted. I politely reiterated that I'd be quite happy to pay, and any sum below 700 quid was fine by me. She wouldn't hear it. I insisted that she at least talk to the gentleman, and reconsider it when sober, but this hurt her pride, and she puffed up and told me that her word was her bond, regardless of blood-alcohol content. Her tattooed friend nodded reassuringly. 

At this point, she insisted it was time to go home, though her friend cajoled her to stay for another round. I snuck in the opportunity to pay for it. In response, she perked up and said that even if I didn't pay a penny, I could cover drinks and make tea as a way of paying my way. I said I was more than happy to do the former, and already was, as a small token of appreciation for letting me know how badly I was being ripped off, but as to the latter, if she expected me to cook she'd better lower her standards and be ready for food poisoning. 

She assured me I couldn't be *that* bad, could I? 

At any rate, she said she was going home, and invited me to come with, so that I could scope out ""my"" room. I said that the gentlemanly thing to do would be to walk her home, and I would be happy to have a word with her husband if he was in. 

Along the way, she stopped at a nearby convenience store and asked if I wanted anything to drink. I demurred, but she insisted on picking *something*, and I said I'll have whatever she's having. There was a bit of a faff at the counter as her phone's contactless payment app asked her to scan her face first, something she was too far gone to manage. I was about to pull up my own card when she figured *something* out, and I grabbed the bag loaded with wine and soft drinks. It was evident that cashiers were well accustomed to handling the drunk and rowdy, I asked if another Indian I'd met there still worked at the place, but was informed he'd moved to Spain. Lucky bugger. 

We went the same route I'd normally take, her house was just a street over. It's a good thing I came along, because she was far from steady on her feet. Along the way, she said something that explained her distaste for my current hosts better than just her dislike of their lifestyle could. It turned out that my landlord's brother had knocked up her sister, and that her family had been embroiled in a lawsuit to establish paternity. This had been before quick and easy DNA testing, and they hadn't been able to win. The father's family had never accepted the kid, but he was older than me now and doing perfectly fine for himself. The rest of the walk was otherwise uneventful, barring her rehashing previous conversation while drunk to the gills. 

We came to her property, which I must say is lovely. She let us in, and I was greeted by a small shih tzu, wagging its tail away as I scratched him under the chin. She called over and asked if liked dogs. 

Love them, I said. And it's absolutely true, though my preference leans towards larger breeds. This one seemed nice, if yappy, and was happy to do laps around his mistress while she called it all kinds of incredibly derogatory names in a most endearing fashion. 

She showed me around, introducing my putative sleeping space with the same enthusiasm as a stage magician or the show runner in a Monty Hall problem. It wasn't terrible, nary a goat nor a super car in sight. A little cramped, but for the price of free this beggar isn't choosy. I was offered the run of the place, though if my present habits are any precedent, I hardly come out of my room. 

She produced a bottle of wine and began pouring us a glass each. I asked her where her husband was, and she said he was down the street, visiting his mother, who wasn't doing too well. She tried calling him, but he didn't pick up, so she ended up FaceTiming another woman. 

A quick recap followed, and when she turned the phone over to me, I genuinely thought I was talking to her daughter and asked the same. She laughed, saying she was her best friend, but I could tell she was pleased. Accidental flattery will get you anywhere, I say. 

She had some kind of role in the educational system, and expressed her frustration at the severe issues she ran into trying to get several kids assessed for learning difficulties. I mentioned that I had ADHD myself, and part of my interest in psychiatry arose from a desire to help out people in a similar boat. I explained that it had taken me *three months* to get assessed even with other medical professionals pulling strings out of collegiality, but that it dismayed me that kids could go years and grades without assessment and much needed help. 

At this point, my would-be host asked if we'd like to step outside for a smoke. I accepted a cigarette, too drunk to particularly hold myself to my usual abstinence, and we went out into their large, but dimly lit garden. She had music playing, and I began to feel growing consternation as she began dancing with me, drawing my hand to her waist and then tugging it lower. She was drunk enough that I didn't face much issue in carefully avoiding it, and once cigarettes burned out, came back in her wake, making sure to close the doors and keep the draft out. 

She excused herself, and ran to the toilet and proceeded to relieve herself with the door open. This was *awkward*, to say the least, and I settled for standing a good distance away and politely pretending I didn't hear her coughing either. I eventually got concerned enough that I asked if she was okay, and was told she was fine, it's just that cigarettes hadn't agreed with her. 

She came out, properly dressed, thank god. She asked me if I'd like a coffee, and I agreed, but insisted on making it for the two of us. At this point in time, her phone rang, and I could hear her husband on the other end, saying he was walking home. 

I'd just about finished up the coffee when he came in, heralded by the dog's barks, and didn't seem *too* surprised by my presence. I believe that at some point she'd mentioned that they'd had a guest over. I introduced myself, and he seemed like a decent sort, turning out to be a manager of several offshore oil rigs. 

She revealed that she ran a wedding boutique, one I'd walked past while on my way to my last haircut. I take back what I said about purchasing clothing not being an option in Small Scottish Town, at least if you're a bride-to-be. 

I apologized for the rather irregular situation, explaining that while I greatly appreciated the kindness his wife had offered me, I felt that I couldn't take advantage of her in her current state, and certainly not without running it by the other relevant stakeholder, her husband (the dog seemed pleased by my company). He seemed entirely fine with it, or at least was too polite to tell me to scram. I guess his wife did have a point about him going along with her suggestions. 

His wife interrupted my excuses by saying that it was *fine*, she wasn't just bringing someone in from the street, was she? 

I pointed out that she had, in fact, brought me in from the street. Or at least that's where we'd met before I had passed the shit-test and grabbed a drink. 

At any rate, I think I had been polite enough while trying to decline the offer, and said I'd give the two of them time to think it over. I assured them that there would be absolutely no hard feelings if they changed their mind, and I would probably figure something out in terms of a place to live regardless. If I'd been paying 700 a month for this long, it was clearly within my budget. 

I walked back home, and that was that. I probably might take them up on it, assuming that the passage of time and the elimination of liquor doesn't prompt second thoughts on their end. 

Inside, I was more than a tad bit thankful that four pints hadn't addled my senses, and that her husband hadn't walked in to find us in flagrante delicto, not that I had been interested.

1ivxq46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnitaMargaritaSnark/comments/1ivxq46/thoughts_from_a_canadian_paralegal_on_all_of_this/,Thoughts from a Canadian Paralegal on all of this,"I have been a paralegal for 20 years and currently manage and work in a law firm practicing in Alberta, Canada. I have extensive experience supporting lawyers and clients, and in certain cases, even representing clients in court. My experience spans multiple practice areas, including civil law, criminal law, family law, and child protection law‚Äîwhich, if you‚Äôre unaware, has its own legislation governing litigation and various aspects of our justice system.

I‚Äôm only posting this once, as I‚Äôm not a regular Reddit user. However, my close cousin, a true crime fanatic, linked me to the TikTok profile and this page because she has been following the situation closely and genuinely believes it will implode in a very negative way. I wanted to share a few comments based on my experience‚Äîyou can take them for what they‚Äôre worth.

At first, when I read through this thread, it did seem like a group of people potentially harassing this young woman on TikTok. However, after watching her live for almost an hour‚Äîbecause I just couldn‚Äôt stop‚Äîmy opinion completely shifted. In my experience, she exhibits significant mental health issues that align with narcissistic traits or even sociopathy. Of course, I‚Äôm not a doctor and can‚Äôt diagnose anyone, but that is my opinion based on what I observed.

She has no legal ability to subpoena Reddit for personal information, and even if she tried, I doubt Reddit‚Äôs legal team would comply, as they likely have default responses for such situations. If Reddit had concerns about this thread, it would have been removed. She has no legal basis for a claim against this discussion because she has willingly put her information in the public domain. I highly doubt that any judge‚Äîeven at the Supreme Court of Canada level‚Äîwould entertain such a case. While our justice system can be tough and at times unfair, common sense still plays a role.

Regarding her ongoing issues with her landlord: she has no legal grounds, though she may delay her eviction temporarily. In all likelihood, she will be evicted. She has claimed that her landlord is not allowed to watch her TikTok lives based on some local bylaw, but that‚Äôs not how civil litigation works. She is publicly displaying how she treats the property and the people who come into it, which only strengthens her landlord‚Äôs case. I can actually see her being ordered to pay legal fees for any case she initiates. Her petition means absolutely nothing legally‚Äîthere is no legislation stating that a landlord must extend someone‚Äôs lease based on a public petition. If this goes to trial or a judicial hearing, the evidence from her TikToks, showing the condition of the home, will likely be presented, and it will undoubtedly impact the judge or mediator handling the case.

As for the allegations of neglect and child abuse, the posts alone likely aren‚Äôt enough to prompt immediate action. It appears she has been in the system for years, and in my experience, narcissists in these cases learn how to navigate every loophole to delay proceedings. Child protection services typically won‚Äôt remove children unless there is substantial cause, which I sincerely hope doesn‚Äôt arise. The incident with the coffee pot falling on the child‚Äôs head was the turning point for me‚Äîit was absolutely disheartening. I am a very black-and-white, opinionated person because I have been in the legal field for over 20 years.

When it comes to child custody, the real issue here is the fathers of the children. There is no reason why a father couldn‚Äôt take the evidence posted on Reddit and TikTok to family court to seek increased parenting time, if not full custody. Family law doesn‚Äôt operate in the same rigid manner as criminal or child protection law. Family courts allow for hearsay, opinions, and circumstantial evidence. At the very least, a Section 211 report (a psychological evaluation of parenting capability) would be ordered. Given the way she speaks to others, her children, and about herself, it is evident that her parenting capabilities are minimal.

Another issue I noticed is that she is creating revenue streams through social media while also appearing to be on government assistance. If that‚Äôs the case, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the CRA took issue with it.

For those of you following this thread, I personally don‚Äôt support slandering someone based on their appearance. However, I can see that many of you genuinely care. I remember my first child protection case as a legal assistant, working through legal aid‚ÄîI was absolutely shocked and heartbroken by what some children endure. Most of us have our own struggles, and no one is perfect, but anyone with a moral compass can see the way she speaks and behaves. When challenged with facts, she lashes out, resorting to personal attacks and using words like ‚Äúnegate‚Äù and ‚Äúdictate‚Äù in completely incorrect contexts‚Äîlikely to sound more intelligent, but with no real understanding of their meaning.

Unfortunately, she is a narcissist.

I won‚Äôt be posting again, but after spending an hour watching this unfold, I felt compelled to share my thoughts. To those who genuinely care, I commend you. And to those engaging in unnecessary slander, I hope you reconsider‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs not who we should be as human beings.

Additionally, the mailroom, package room, business center, and gym are all on the 1st floor of the same building, so you can access them conveniently without going outside. The apartment is well-maintained, very clean, and quiet.

It is less than a 5-minute walk to Downtown Carrollton, where you can easily access various amenities such as coffee shops, bubble tea stores, multiple restaurants, and a bakery specializing in madeleines.

It's definitely not about a person with AvPD, but I feel certain themes in it very deeply and I thought some you may like some of the lines as well. You can read the full poem [here](https://eventhealphabet.livejournal.com/39167.html) and [here](https://youtu.be/tqdQ2CbI3WE), you can listen to its spoken word recitation with ambient musical background. I'll paste the most applicable and impactful (in my opinion) lines so you can see if they make you feel a certain way as well.

> *Christian is just learning to speak.
He unravels over the phone like a sweater.*

> *Christian keeps a box under his bed.
He whispers in his sleep.
He always carries his passport with him
in case he has to suddenly disappear.*

> *Christian boils down his days to
coffee, errands, bills, regrets,
daydreams, drinks, crying fits,
phone calls, nightmares.*

> *In two days he's brittle again,
a china boy who chips away at his skin
just to see how little it takes to leave a mark.*

> *Was it like this before? he asks.
Will it be like this forever?*

> *I just don't want to go home.
I just don't want to go home alone,
he whispers, as if the oxygen
costs too much.*

Nicole Blackman not only can portray horror, sorrow, depression and self-destruction in blunt, yet incredibly inventive ways, but it often feels like she's better at reading my brain than I am, these lines being just a few examples from just one poem. While none of her work, as far as I know, directly concerns any disorders or conditions, I think anyone with any kind of emotional struggle can find something they can resonate with.

At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right?

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**

I left the monthly Credit Card payments to show how my expenses average month to month.   The total ""normal"" expenses this year ended up being around $44,000 which is about $10,000 more than 2024.  This makes sense, since I had a ~$9000 ten day vacation to Iceland in October.

There were two additional expenses last year not shown above.  I bought a Tesla Model Y in March for $48,000, and then bought a Tesla Cybertruck in June for $107,000.   I sold my old 2018 Subaru STI for $24,500 and sold the Model Y for $40,000.  The TLDR here is that I knew the CT was coming but I wasn't expecting it so soon, so I wanted to get into a Tesla to get accustomed to driving an EV.  I happened to get that great offer to buy my STI so I took it and bought the Y.  If I knew I'd be getting the truck three months later I would have made different choices, but it is what it is.  Loved the Model Y, love the Cybertruck even more.  Best vehicle I've ever owned, it's awesome.  [Note, the Model Y and Cybertruck purchases were with cash, no loans.]

Next topic is income Taxes.  I have this broken out from ""typical"" expenses because for me because it's a function of my ""income"" which I control by realizing capital gains, which for me are kind of artificially high.  For 2024 my AGI was around $570,000 so my Fed Liability was $93,000 and State Liability was $24,000.   For **me** it doesn't make sense for me to roll those numbers into my expenses and say ""My expenses for 2024 was $161,000.""  That's just not a useful number for me to appreciate.

Looking more closely at the Credit Card, I see 70 line items for Amazon Purchases (more on that later), and 677 other line items.  Finally Grok3 shows its usefulness.  I'll just go through the heavy hitters:

Category| Total Expense| Line Items
:--|:--|:--|
Dinner	|$3,552	|98
Fast Food	|$1,660	|81
JunkSnack |$461|45
Pizza|$820|38
Coffee/Smoothie|$321|37
Groceries|$2,023|31
7-11 (Also JunkSnack)|$225|25
ICELAND|$5691|64
Video Games|$215|18
Lunch | $337|18
Car Wash|$82|11
Amazon Prime| $190| 12
Dental Insurance| $365|12
Utilties kWh | $1370|12
Utilities Internet | $976| 13

And some other stuff.  7-11 is popping in for a Hot Dog and a Slurpie.  JunkSnack is all the stupid <$10 gas station charges I see.  Fast Food is the BK, McD, Taco Bell, Arbies lines.  Lunch and Dinner would be more Restaurant-y type places.  I've recently started to go to Tropical Smoothie Cafe and Bigby Coffee to get smoothies: huge waste of money at $7 a pop, but they are yummy.

And finally: Amazon.  Report just came through, 105 line items.  Coffee stuff, microfiber cloths, some Atkins shakes, Cough Drops and other OTC stuff, ramen.  But, what about the Jerky and Redbull?!?!  There are 5 line items for Beef Jerky (and 3 line items for Slim Jims, we'll throw that in), and 41 lines for RedBull.  Total cost of Beef Jerky (and jerky adjacent products) was $490 and Red Bull was $2010.   Last year's update was $3000 in Beef Jerky and $3350 in Redbull.  We did it guys!  Pizza category is also down about 50% from last year.

The stock market was ripping last year and Bitcoin entered another booming cycle after the Halvening last year.   I stuck with my pre-determined plan that I've been executing for the past 10 years: sell off a fraction of my bitcoin every time the price increases 10%, and on a big retrace buy some back.   If the price just keeps going up I need to be happy with my sell point (I am), and if it comes back down the net result is I've sold near the top.   This time I ended up hitting ""sell triggers"" like six times.  This caused me to realize a lot of long term capital gains and a hefty tax bill, but I'm executing my plan and must be satisfied with those results.

I had a side little dalliance with TSLA too.  In July of 2024 TSLA was at $265 and then ""crashed"" after an earnings call, so I decided to make a move.  I bought $100,000 of TSLA at $219.  Since then I've executed a similar plan, trying to keep my holdings at a value of $100k.  I sold 55 shares at $270, 50 @ $290, 50 @ $346, and 50 @ $400.   So I was able to realize $67,000 in gains and still have 250 shares ($85k).   Over the years there have been a few times I wanted to make a move into TSLA, saw a similar opportunity but never did it (and it would have obviously ended well).  I'm glad I finally decided to take the action.

Roth Conversion Ladder!  The first few years I was doing $20, and now I'm doing $26,000 per year to fill the standard deduction and the 10% bracket.  I was comtemplating doing the 12% bracket last year also but my tax bill was already bananas so I didn't.  If this year Bitcoin stays flat and I don't need to sell off I'll consider doing a larget conversion this year.  The plan is to keep building the ladder but not ""removing any rungs.""  Those first year conversions will just be there available in the future if I need or want to use them.

High Level Picture: after expenses, buying and selling cars, and going on vacation, at the end of the day my start number was $2,005,000 and end number was $2,947,000.    ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**LIFE STUFF**

Life's been great.  I went on a 10 day vacation to Iceland in October with four couples.  We rented three Landcruisers and did the Ring Road, staying in eight different locations / hotels.   Some of the best food we ever had, it was a great time.  We hit the weather lottery too, it was clear and sunny with temps in the 45¬∞F range, got into a little bit of snow around day 5 when we were in the north, but driving was clear.   There was been chatter about the next group vacation being to Greece, but no timetables on that yet.

Still board gaming with a few of my friends.  The typical host has two kids that are getting older, turning 4 and 6 this year.  They are sweethearts, I can't wait until they get older and want to play games with us.  I get over that way a couple times per month for dinner and games.  Once I move house (if that ever happens, I feel like I've been talking about that for three years), it could be even more frequent to pop over.

""What do you do with all your time?!?"" Keep up my house, leasurely shop, cook for myself (my expenses list betraying me right now...).  I have a nice selection of YouTube channels I like to watch which in combination have a couple hours of new uploads every day to check out.  I really like Reaction channels, actually.  It's a way to rewatch a show or movie in a condensed way while also getting the enjoyment of seeing someone else experience it for the first time.   I have a good half-dozen channels I really like, which means I end up ""watching a movie with a friend"" basically every day.

I haven't been gaming all that much lately, but it goes in spurts.  A new game or season will come out, I'll go hard on it for a few days or a week, then put it back down.

Back in 2020, they were already killing it with gaming GPUs and starting to make moves in AI. Fast forward to now, and they‚Äôre not just ‚Äúthe gaming graphics company‚Äù anymore they‚Äôre simply everywhere. Like, seriously, their tech is in self-driving cars, robots, drones, and probably your smart fridge next (okay, maybe not yet, but give it a year ^^)

And the future? Oh man, they‚Äôre going all-in. They‚Äôre leading the charge on edge computing, which basically means your devices are about to get scary smart without needing the cloud. Imagine your coffee machine knowing how you like your coffee before you even open your eyes (finally, a machine that gets me, yes). They‚Äôre also diving into IoT, so their chips could end up in literally anything: factory robots, medical devices, maybe even your dog‚Äôs collar that tracks its mood or something.

But here‚Äôs the thing: NVIDIA isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúanother tech company.‚Äù They‚Äôve become the backbone of innovation. Think about it, most of the big AI breakthroughs we‚Äôve seen? Powered by NVIDIA GPUs. ChatGPT? Yep, trained on them. Self-driving tech? That‚Äôs NVIDIA too. Hell, I wouldnt even mind if this post was written using ChatGPT nowadays. At this point, NVIDIA feels like the no-brainer for anything cutting-edge in tech.

And let‚Äôs not forget, AI itself is kind of a black box. Like, we know it works and does cool stuff and all, but do we really understand what‚Äôs going on under the hood? NVIDIA is building the tools that make all of this possible. It‚Äôs exciting as hell but also makes me wondering and worrying all the same by how deep this rabbit hole goes.

What do you think? Are we all just living in NVIDIA‚Äôs new world order from now on? Or should we start thanking our GPUs for running half our lives in future instead? Will certain groups that use AI as a Tool, be more powerful in future than average? Im Torn here and forth",2,1740270477.0,NvidiaStock,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm in my early twenties and about to move into my first apartment. I don‚Äôt have much experience with interior design, so I‚Äôd love some advice on furniture placement and color choices for my living room!

Here‚Äôs what I have so far:

* **Brown dining table with black metal legs**
* **Two black/bronze lamps**

I‚Äôm planning to add:

* A **coffee table**
* A **lowboard for the TV**
* A **rug for the couch area**

My main questions:

* How would you arrange these pieces in the room?
* I‚Äôm considering painting the TV wall **midnight blue or petrol blue** and the other walls in **greige, taupe, or light beige**‚Äîdo you think this works?
* What colors would you recommend for the coffee table, lowboard, and rug to tie everything together?

You know, those little chores you keep putting off because they seem so‚Ä¶ well, boring. What if we turned them into quick wins instead of endless to-dos?

Here‚Äôs the trick I‚Äôve been using lately:

1. **Set a Mini Deadline**  
   Give yourself 5, 10, or 15 minutes‚Äîtops. Knowing there's a finish line coming up fast helps turn the task into a mini-challenge instead of a dreaded chore.

2. **Treat Yourself**  
   Promise yourself a small (or big!) treat after finishing. A cup of coffee, a few minutes of social media guilt-free, or that cookie you‚Äôve been eyeing. It‚Äôs like telling your brain, ‚ÄúHey, once we‚Äôre done, there‚Äôs a sweet reward.‚Äù

3. **Arrange a Game Plan**  
   Figure out the *exact* steps. If it‚Äôs cleaning your desk, decide: Throw trash, organize pens, wipe surface. Breaking it down helps you zip through it like a to-do ninja.

4. **Use the Loud Music Strategy**  
   Blast a favorite playlist (or any jam that makes you feel pumped). It tricks your mind into thinking you‚Äôre having a mini dance party instead of tackling something mundane.

Ever tried any of these? It might sound silly, but little hacks like these can make a huge difference. I used to dread even folding laundry‚Äîuntil I turned it into a 15-minute ‚Äúbeat the clock‚Äù challenge. Suddenly, it became a game I could *win.*

Have you found any other ways to turn boring tasks into quick wins? One small tweak can really shift your energy for the rest of the day. It‚Äôs crazy how a sprinkle of fun can take us from ‚ÄúUgh, not this again‚Ä¶‚Äù to ‚ÄúAll done‚Äîwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù",1,1740269819.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I came from a 5 year relationship na halos sampung beses ata akong niloko ng ex ko. Traumatizing yes. So ever since talagang sinabi ko na sa sarili ko na never kong maintindihan kung bakit nila ginagawa yun and like I've said, walang acceptable reason sa panggagago.

I've been single for awhile already when I met a guy last May 2024. Ganda ng ngipin, Dad Bod, we have the same taste sa music and ang ganda ngumiti. He's cute and good looking at the same time, physically attractive and he's smart. Cut to the chase, everything went smoothly, ang bilis namin nagkapalagayan ng loob. He's a good conversationalist and may emotional intelligence. We've been seeing each other for a month, nung bigla kong nahuli sa phone nya na may girlfriend pala siya. And right there and then, I told him that we should stop seeing each other. Mahirap but I know that it is the right thing to do. 

We lost connection for a month. And I tried my best not to think of him anymore. Kinaya ko naman. Kahit papano, di ko naman na sya iniisip. But after a month, nagising na lang ako ng madaling araw that he's knocking on my door. 

To make it short, we got back together. He said they are no longer together. He explained things to me, and I believed him. We live together for 6 months. Every weekdays kaming magkasama, pag weekend, umuuwi siya sa family niya sa Cavite. Naging ganun yung routine namin for 6 months. We do things together, taking a shower, watching movies, eating together, doing groceries, we actually look like a married couple. He rarely uses his phone pag magkasama kami except pag work calls. We were so inlove and so happy. There were times na uupo lang kami sa balcony, mag ve vape, and will talk about random stuffs. Like work, Yung kaibigan kong laging problemado sa lovelife, yung kaibigan niyang namatay, Future plans and us in the future. It was amazing. Wonderful. Magical.

Until one day, nag tampuhan kami sa isang sobrang liit na bagay. Akala ko simpleng tampuhan lang. Umuwi siya that day because it's friday. Nagintay ako ng Saturday, sunday, wala siyang messages. I waited for him ng Monday kasi ganun naman schedule niya eh, monday before 7am nasa condo na siya. Pero wala. Di siya bumalik. Himdi na ko nakatiis kaya ako na yung nagmessage, then sabi niya, he gave up already. 

I was lost. Super lost. Para akong batang iniwanan sa mall tapos hindi ko alam yung daan pauwi. What have I done wrong? Bakit? Hindi ko maintindihan. Ang dami kong tanong. Gulong gulo ako. He left me and totally cut me off in his life. Hindi na niya siniseen yung messages ko. Hindi na din nag rereply. Sobrang lost ako, and I isolated myself for a month. Out of everything. Socials. Friends. Family. Parang naging patapon yung buhay ko. Balik sa pagyoyosi and pag iinom. Smoke. And suicidal attempts. Medyo nabagok lang yung ulo ko nung time na naospital na ko and got diagnosed for General Anxiety Disorder.

2 months since we got separated, unti unti ko na ulit binubuo yung sarili ko. I got back to work. Nag dalawa, tatlong client pa ko sa pag vi VA para lang ma occupy yung utak ko. I went back to Cavite, sa family ko. Kasi di ko na kayang magstay sa condo, kasi everytime na nandun ako, parang nakikita ko sya sa bawat sulok ng kwarto. Then one day, I found out the truth. He lied. Ever since, hindi pala sila naghiwalay ng girlfriend niya. From the start, kabet pala ako. Gulong gulo ako, hindi ko maintindihan, 6 Months living together, pano niya naitago sakin yun? Hindi ko alam yung mararamdaman ko, I felt like I got used and manipulated. The day na nalaman ko, ang unang unang gusto kong gawin, ichat yung girlfriend niya. I wanna let her know that he's not the kind of guy that she thinks he is. I wanna ruin him just like how he ruined my life. Gusto ko siyang gantihan ksi gago siya.

I had the chance to confront him about it. And inamin niya yung totoo. I asked him everything, kasi yun na yung time para iclear ko lahat ng nasa utak ko. I asked him

""Bakit? Why did you left me just like that? Did you just used me for your own benefit? 1 year kayo together and sa 1 year na yun, 6 months nandun din ako, past time ba ako? Iniwan mo ba ko because you think it's the right thing to do or because you realized that you love her and you don't want to hurt her more? 6 months, was any of it true? Minahal mo ba ko? Totoo bang naging masaya ka or nag assume lang ako? Bakit parang ang dali sali sayo?""

Then he answered.

""You made me a home. You made yourself my wife. You made me a father. You made me everything. Do you think it would be that easy for me with all those? No words can express how much I love and miss you. Everyday akong tumitingin sa taas ng condo mo hoping that I would see you sa balcony. It's not easy not open this app and chat you. It's not easy not going back knowing I still have the key. It's not easy. Nothing was easy for me too. I was not married, but you made me feel like I am. You don't know how much you've made me happy that time that we were together""

Hindi kami nagkabalikan, but I guess I had the closure that I needed. Nasagot na yung mga tanong na naiwan sa utak ko.

If by any chance, you came across this post, I just wanna let you know that I was hurt and I still am. But I know that you're hurting too. Will everything that happened, pinapatawad na kita. So sana mapatawad mo din ang sarili mo. Katulad ng palagi kong sinasabi sayo, you are so much more than what you think you are. Please live better. Love better. Live happy.  Kahit anong gusto kong gantihan ka, I'll just leave this all in the past and let everything flows on its own. I wanna see you achieve everything that you've ever dreamed of. I wanna see you live a better life. Alam kong mali lahat, alam kong madaming magja judge sakin dito sa sasabihin ko, but sa lahat ng nalaman ko, I know it's wrong but I was happy in that 6 months with you.

 You bring me to that coffee shop in Rizal because nabanggit ko sayo once that I really wanted to go there, you know how important the 19th of the month is with me and you always make sure we celebrate it. You gave me my first prom dance because I told you I never experienced attending a prom in highschool. Sinuong mo yung ulan just to find me that time na may incident with my ex. You accepted and love me and everything about me. Never mong ginamit yung past ko against me. Because you said, it doesn't define who I am.

1ivx494,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1ivx494/ufe_uae_procedure_yesterday_and_how_i_got_here/,UFE / UAE Procedure Yesterday (and how I got here),"Reddit was such a great source of information for me as I was trying to decide what to do, so wanted to contribute my personal experience. For a condition that affects so many women, there is shockingly very little education about it. 

About me: Female, age 45, single, no kids, not planning to have kids

Actual procedure:
This was yesterday (Friday). Arrived 7AM for an 8AM procedure time. Had to fast after midnight, clear liquids ok (I only had water). Procedure was performed by an Interventional Radiologist. She had another doctor assisting, and there were at least 3 nurses, maybe more. I don‚Äôt remember an anesthesiologist or if there was one, they didn‚Äôt introduce themselves to me. I guess I‚Äôll find out when I see the bill. They gave me something that made me sleepy, some people are conscious throughout but I think I fell asleep. It was supposed to take 90 mins but they kept saying how fast it went when it was done, so I think it may have been done 45 mins to an hour? 

The actual procedure was painless, they put a catheter in my left wrist where the beads are inserted, and something else in my vein which I think is for the dye so that they could see the beads. I was advised not to shower for 24 hours after so that I didn‚Äôt get the wrist incision wet. When I finally did shower, it looked pretty healed up so no issue there. Some very minor bruising. Also not supposed to lift anything heavy or put pressure on my left wrist so that I don‚Äôt reopen the incision.

But OH BOY when they wheeled me to recovery, I started progressively cramping and I would say from about 15 mins post procedure until like 18 hours after, I had the most intense abdominal pain I have ever felt in my life. It also somehow got to my lower back and hips. It‚Äôs like my worst period cramp I‚Äôve ever had x 20. Never had kids so can‚Äôt compare it to childbirth but if this is what my ladies go through, god bless you. I was prepared for the pain, but was not prepared for the meds not to work. Oxycodone did nothing, so they gave me Dilaudid. AND IT DID NOTHING!! They made me stay at least two hours post procedure which is standard. After sulking and kvetching for another 2 hours, I finally willed myself to get up and get dressed to go home, largely because I felt bad that my sister had taken time off work to come get me. I‚Äôm glad she was there, I was making a big stink about needing an escort and why can‚Äôt I just leave on my own when I‚Äôm ready, but I don‚Äôt think I could have made it. I was not given the option to stay overnight; part of me wishes I had been so that I didn‚Äôt leave in so much pain, but also I‚Äôm not sure it would have helped if they couldn‚Äôt give me anything that made the pain go away. 

I kept up with the oxy even though it didn‚Äôt feel like it was doing anything. THIS IS IMPORTANT - they advised to keep up with the pain meds, which means setting alarms to wake up in the middle of the night. Didn‚Äôt eat anything this whole time, and I forgot to buy juice/didn‚Äôt feel like broth so I was just sipping water here and there but even the water made me want to throw up. But since I didn‚Äôt really have anything to throw up, all I ended up doing was gagging and peeing myself from the abdominal pressure, so it‚Äôs good that I remembered to sit on the toilet for this. There was something for nausea but I‚Äôm not sure how effective it was. I actually found it more helpful sucking on mints.

And then magically at around the 18 hour mark (early Saturday morning) I felt more human again. Slightly crampy especially when it was getting close to my next dose of oxy, but at least I wasn‚Äôt feeling so nauseous and could hold down small things like fruit jello cups and even coffee. I‚Äôve progressively made my way up to noodles and rice porridge (it‚Äôs now Saturday evening).

I had some mild spotting starting maybe like 5-6 hours post procedure.

I haven‚Äôt had a poo since Thursday though so that‚Äôs my next goal lol. They do prescribe miralex so I hope between that and coffee and now that I‚Äôm eating solid food, something happens soon.

How I arrived at the decision for UFE:
I first suspected I may have fibroids summer of 2022 when I felt a small, hard mass when I pressed down on my belly. I‚Äôve had heavy periods and cramping over the years but was fibroids wasn‚Äôt even on any doctor‚Äôs radar. I actually had to ask my PCP about it, even after she did a pelvic exam / Pap smear. Granted I wasn‚Äôt regularly going to an OB/GYN but I‚Äôm shocked that if it‚Äôs something I could feel, why wouldn‚Äôt a trained medical professional be on the lookout for it?

I was then referred to an OB/GYN who did an ultrasound, confirmed fibroids and polyps and swiftly moved to remove the polyps because even though they were benign, that‚Äôs typically where cancer risk is. She insisted the fibroids were not an issue unless it was causing heavy bleeding or cramps during periods. I explained that while the periods weren‚Äôt so debilitating as they had been in the past, the fibroids felt like they were physically getting in the way. It‚Äôs uncomfortable to do sit ups. I pee a little when I jump. And honestly, it‚Äôs unpleasant to have a belly that sticks out which I suspected was due to the fibroids. Her response: All women have bellies. As soon as I heard that I was out. She also spent less and less time with me each appointment and made me feel rushed and uninformed.

At the same time, I had been seeing a physiatrist for lower back and hip pain that was progressively getting worse and not improving with PT. While the scans did not surface a direct correlation, she speculated that there‚Äôs a chance it could be related, and she has had patients who when treating the fibroids also found relief for their back and hip pain. When I related my experience with my OB/GYN, she advised me to look for gynecologists specializing in fibroid care and with experience performing myomectomies. Sure enough when I looked up my OB/GYNs experience, she had performed little to none. 

By this point we are into 2023, and I did some research here and there but didn‚Äôt really move forward with anything. I wish I had pushed sooner but tbh I felt a little stuck. Something else ‚Äúmore urgent‚Äù always seemed to take priority.

At some point early 2024, I got my period on a flight back to NYC and had the worst cramps I‚Äôve ever had, and literally thought I was hemorrhaging to death. I went to my PCP and again she wasn‚Äôt concerned (yes maybe I should find a new PCP at this point, but she could see me the next day‚Ä¶). In any case, I‚Äôm convinced this was fibroid related so this lit a fire under me to actually do something to address.

My search brought me to NYU Langone Center for Fibroid Care and I felt like there was light at the end of the tunnel. I got a pelvic MRI, met with the surgeon‚Äôs NP who spent a lot of time explaining everything to me and then met with the gynecological surgeon specializing in fibroid care who spent more time with me talking through options. The MRI showed that I had ~20 uterine fibroids, with 3 dominant (2 subserosal and 1 intramural) Largest was one of the subserosal at 6 x 5 x 5 cm. I was told my uterus was the size of approx 4-month pregnancy, and the pressure was causing my bladder to collapse.

The surgeon advised that given the number and size of my fibroids, my only options were UFE or hysterectomy. Myomectomy would be too invasive and given my age they would likely grow back so didn‚Äôt really make sense. She also said if I needed more time to make a decision, there was a drug regimen that I could take for a short period of time to limit the growth but it wasn‚Äôt a long term solution (I think it was 6 months). I honestly wanted to just do a hysterectomy at this point, but the surgeon advised that if I had even an inkling of doubt in getting a hysterectomy, that the UFE was a very good path forward for someone in my situation. Hysterectomies are permanent and some people have regrets if they are not fully ready.

She then referred me to an Interventional Radiologist. Again, they spent a lot of time with me talking me through the procedure and how it would address my situation. I came away feeling like I had enough information to make a decision. I‚Äôd never had doctors and their staff spend so much time just talking to me before between the surgeon and the interventional radiologist.

I guess it remains to be seen whether the UFE ends up being effective for me, seeing that I‚Äôm day 1 post procedure :) I am supposed to book an MRI follow up in 6 months I think, I‚Äôll be sure to come back and report on progress!",3,1740269650.0,Fibroids,1,1.0,False

- Growing up I found interest in Animation, making my own cartoons on windows 98.
- I found music in my late Teens, mostly Metal/Emo/Punk
- I started creating my own music in Studio One
- I found interest in philosophy, studies in existence, reality, paradoxes
- I found interests in creating programs in Excel, writing VBA script and Macros etc
- I found myself listening to Extra Terrestrial material about life/reality via channeller Darryl Anka, which led me to temporarily quitting my job
- Went back to work and found myself now listening to Channeller Geoffrey Hoppe channeler at Crimson Circle about life/reality/truth/the story of earth, why we're here, who we really are etc.
- between Darryl Anka and Geoffrey Hoppe these teachings went on for about 10 years (my mid 20s to mid 30s)
- eventually something changed in my brain, my beliefs, my foundation of who I thought I was and what I thought I was doing, my overall perspective of myself and life... I had a mental breakdown, which felt like psychosis - complete disorientation of my whole life..

Looking back on all this I am seeing how all the things I did, the animation, the music, the programs...the philosophy and channeling... It all feels like these were ways of trying to find the perfect mirror to wear... So that at every angle I could substitute what is required of me, what is expected of me for what is being presented to me... 

It's like if I knew the ins and outs of life from a foundational place, the roots of it all... Then in any given circumstance I would always be ahead of the circumstance, as to be able to explain it off - I would always have the answer...

I'm so exhausted from trying to figure out myself in relationship to the rest of the world. Because it feels like I don't belong. Like the rest of the world is this giant boardgame and I am one of those board pieces that doesn't match the game... ""Like dice with a chess board.""

(I love chess btw)

Reviewing all these different aspects of my life I've began asking myself questions like ""am I autistic?""... I am definitely Neuro Divergent... But then that philosophical side of me comes out and says... 

""Words are made up... do you realise the insanity of that? Do you realise that, yes, words and language are what makes a complex society ""functional"" (if you can even call it functional), but when you see a tree... That is not ""a tree""... It's not what it is... Just in the same way that you can say hateful words to a dog in a loving manner, the dog responds to the emotion behind it, the resonance...""

So this whole language thing I can never take seriously... To label something and say ""I am kvnsnfksnd"" or ""I have jvjdncnsk"".. it's like what? The part of the brain that reads ""I am"" and then skips the next jibberish part... Is the cognition that understands the logical, artificially created world... And yet the jibberish part is actually how it really is...

However if you want to live and survive and participate in this life, you gotta take on this made up language and be serious about it, you gotta make it what you are, you gotta make it what it is... And I'm probably not the first to say it but.. it's bull shit the degree of conformity it takes to be human, to go day after day, week after week pretending the world we've created using this made up language is what it actually is... And all the manuipluation that comes with the language - advertisements, sexual coercion, narcissism, passive aggression, addiction..

It's just too complex, all of it. The internet has made it so much more complex, the constant connectivity, the growing expectations that come from technology... The role of a YouTuber utilising trends and taking advantage of the psychological conditions of people (knowingly or unknowingly) in order to generate their own revenue... Content content content content, patterns, emptiness, nothing with sustainance..

I've seen it in my workplace, the level of toxicity increasing rapidly... We have a safety guy who is constantly creating more safety rules - the moment any kind of incident that occurs - new rule... And they don't see it but the level of preventative actions they're taking to try and make things more safe has actually gone and done the opposite... The degree of safety has now created hazards...

I've always said this when it comes to designing programs in Excel... You need a balance of automation and manual user input... If either is too much, you get an abundance of errors and bugs... It's the same with this safety stuff... You have to allow room for user error, if you compensate too much you void the reason for the human to be there in the first place, all those attributes that allows the human to be human is taken away through precautions... And precautions are anxiety riddled...it's like stripping the soul...

So.. my post has skewed a lot and I've been meaning to get up and make banana bread and coffee...",0,1740269575.0,neurodiversity,0,0.5,False

We also get a lot of tire kickers or people just passing the time, which is fine! But why is it that so many of those people are, simply put, the worst?
The last hour of my day went like this:
Customer A: ""my dream is to own a victrola. Literally, it's my dream."" 
My partner: ""Hey actua-""
Customer A: ""An old one!""
My partner: ""We just got one in 2 hours ago, it's a 1921 portable victrola. Its in amazing shape too."" *does entire demo*
A: *grimacing in disgust* ""Not that one.""

Customer B walks in, I'm guessing in that 18-21age range. It's 15 minutes to closing. They slowly open the door so the bell doesn't ring. Their next move is to pick up an empty reel case on display. I inform them it's an empty case for display. 
B: üòê
Me: ""i have that album for sale though if you'd like it!""
B: üôÇüòê
Me: ""It's a vinyl record though."" 
B continues to stare and say nothing. I look down, maybe 30 seconds pass and they're suddenly at my desk, still silent.
Me: ""Oh! Did you want me to grab that record?""
B: ""No""
Me: ""Haha no worries! Is there something you're looking for?""
B: ""I'm killing time.""
Me: ""sure I get that! There's a coffee shop down the road that's really good if you need to kill more time!"" 
B: ""if you're buying."" *wink*
I tell him, he'll have to buy his own $6 drink. He then goes and plays with another item on display and puts it directly on the sign that says ""DO NOT TOUCH.""
He leaves at exactly 1 minute to close. And Customer A is still parked in right in front of the store, they've been sitting in their car for 30 minutes, taking up one of the few free street parking spots.
Why. What signals am I giving that I would buy this creepy child an artisinal coffee?? Why do you have to touch everything??? Why won't you leave!

Pre text; his name is Chevy, 8 years old he is a mix but the closest thing to a French basset. He has separation anxiety and is taking 40mg of human grade fluoxetine(do not get me started, I tried all the ""natural"" stuff and he'd fight it) (has been medicated for 6 years and has been upped 2 tiwce so he at the max)he has his good moments, but he is that dog that set the bar as when people refer to other dogs they say, well at least they're not as bad as Chevy. My vet said he would of given up on him.
Going to keep this short and detailed as possible, me and my wife our at are wits end. My dog will not let us sleep. I don't know what started to cause this issue. We narrowed it down to he has full blown anxiety attack over my cpap. He will sleep fine in any other situation but he hears it hiss or wine(when I adjust my mask in my sleep, I'm at 19psi and it's not the machine it's the seal to my face) he'll start to freak out. He'll make it our problem too, he'll stand and step on us to wake us up. You can only get him out of bed so many times till your tired. Can't lock him out side he'll trash something, or stress poop in the basement, can't lock him in another room he'll make a hole in the door, can't put him in a cage, he destroyed 3. The 3rd one he lucky to be alive he was so cut up and blood was all over the wall cause he doesn't know any better. I would give him alittle trazadone before bed but that would make him aggressive. Me and my wife would sleep in seprate beds and he'll be locked in with Me so my wife can sleep. It has gotten to the point that he anxiety drools all of me, all night. 
The positive things I've tried exercising and walking him more, I've tried getting Him used to the cpap during the day just a causal thing, gave him more stimulant tricks to do. I'm trying to get a quieter mask.
He is ""coffee shop"" trained and I will have hime sit on a place while I let him get used to the cpap seal make noise but it's made him worse. Luckily my parents will take him some nights and he sleeps with them just fine with no issue.
Everyone said they'd give up on him, I refuse to. He's my idiot!

1ivx1i9,https://i.redd.it/nxhbxe6i6ske1.jpeg,Pavers In The Darkroom,"I had an intense session a few nights ago that I want to share.¬†¬†I woke up at 2:30 am, wide awake.¬†¬†I drank some room-temperature coffee I had made before going to bed.¬†¬†I sat down to recap the events from the day prior, and whatever else popped into my head.¬†¬†When I recap, it‚Äôs usually at the start of my Darkroom session, done with eyes open, eye mask on, and while trying to quiet my internal dialogue.¬†¬†By the time I finished the day‚Äôs events I had hot-pink mist in front of me.¬†¬†

I started my 90-minute tensegrity routine(Silence, Dream, Center for Decisions, Vol 1 DVD, Unbending Intent - Mashing & Stirring, and Vol 2 DVD).  I was interrupted in the middle of Center for Decisions passes and reflexively took off my eye mask.¬†¬†Before doing that, puffs were dancing; I had already stuffed a few and saw a few dark red streaks come and go in the background.¬†¬†During the dream passes, I remember feeling a lot of spider webs and even felt hairs tickling my nose.¬†¬†

Tangent: Keep your mask on when interrupted to help retain your progress.¬†¬†Once I start my session, I try to keep my mask on until my alarm goes off.¬†¬†This includes going downstairs for water or the bathroom(within reason).¬†¬†There are a lot of fun sights to see when you venture out of your dark room with your mask on while your AP is away from its habitual position.

After the interruption, I did some more recap of recent events, got myself back to the same point as earlier, and finished my passes.¬†¬†I had a nice Affection for Energy Body silhouette form.¬†¬†Throughout the passes, I experienced bright, vivid colors, jet blackness, my body glowing, and a strong (to me) IOB presence.¬†¬†The stick figure bird that flies around and the eyeballs were active throughout my session.

Tangent: I‚Äôm now noticing the importance of tightening my abdominal muscles and hamstrings when performing passes.¬†¬†It helps quiet my internal dialogue by moving my attention to tightening those muscle groups while performing the movements.¬†¬†It‚Äôs noted in the Magical Passes book, but not something I noticed and put into practice until recently.

I sat to gaze in my lawn chair and did seated running man passes and head sweeps.¬†¬†Once the colored clouds and surfaces started flowing, I called out to ‚Äòintent‚Äô a few times, continued with the head sweeps, saw a dark spot on a surface, stopped to inspect, and the spot developed depth, like looking into a cylinder.¬†¬†At some point after this, I stopped mid-blank-out and noticed darkness surrounding me, a white fog, and behind the fog, what appeared to be a pattern of rectangles and squares resembling pavers(outdoor stone flooring).¬†¬†The fog was relatively static.  The background of the pavers moved up for a good 10-15 seconds, then shifted directions and panned to the right for the same amount of time.¬†¬†The paver pattern looked like it was projected onto a screen three to four feet(one meter) in front of me; at this point, my ID started acting up, and I noticed the moving pattern turning dark red.¬†¬†After this, dreams and blackouts marred my session.  One quick dream, I looked at my hands and left the dream; the other was longer, and I had only a little rationality.¬†¬†At some point between dreams, I got a repeat of a sight behind the fog, except it was of a house on a culdesack, and it didn‚Äôt move.",3,1740269432.0,castaneda,0,1.0,False

You have got a kick ass workflow in n8n or an awesome agent you wrote in Python and everything works great from your computer.... But now what? How do you make this agent accessible to an end point user or a commercial customer?

In this article I want to shatter the myth and fill-in the blanks, because for 99.9% of the youtube tutorials out there they show you how to automate scheduling an appointment and updating an Airtable, but they dont show you how to actually deploy the agent.

Alright so first of all get the mind set right and think, how is someone else going to reach the trigger node? It has to be stored someone where online that is reachable anywhere right? CORRECT!

Your answer for most agents will be a cloud platform. Yes some enterprise customers will host themselves, but most will be cloud.

Now there are quite literally a million ways you can do this, so please don't reply in the comments with ""why didnt you suggest xxx, or why did you not mention xxx"". This is MY suggestion for the easiest way to deploy AI agents, im not saying its the ONLY way, I am aware there are many multiple ways of deploying. But this is meant to be a simple easy to understand deployment guide for my beloved AI newbs.

Many of you are using n8n, and you are right to, n8n is bloody amazing, even for seasoned pros like me. I can code, but why do i need to spend 3 hours coding when i can spin up an n8n workflow in a few minutes !?

So let's deploy your n8n agent on the internet so its reachable for your customer:

{ 1 } Sign up for an account at¬†[render.com](http://render.com/)

{ 2 } Once you are logged in you will create a new 'Resource' type - 'Web Services'

{ 3 } On the next screen, from the tabs, select 'Existing Image'

{ 4 } In the URL box type in:

    docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

{ 5 } Now click the CONNECT button

{ 6 } Name your project on the next screen, and under region choose the region that is closest to the end point user.

{ 7 } Now choose your instance type (starter, pro etc)

{ 8 } Finally click on the 'Deploy' button at the bottom

{ 9 } Grab a coffee and wait for your new cloud instance to be spun up. Once its ready at the top of your screen in green is the URL.  
{ 10 } You will now be presented with your n8n login screen. Login, create an account and upload your json file.

Depending on how you structure your business you can then hand this account over to the customer for paying the bills and managing or you incorporate that in to your subscription model.

Your n8n AI agentic workflow is now reachable online from anywhere in the world.

Alright so for coded agents you can still do the same thing using¬†[Render.com](http://render.com/)¬†or we can use Replit. Replit have a great web based IDE where you can code your agent, or copy and paste in your code from another IDE and then replit have built in cloud deployment options, within a few clicks of your mouse yo u can deploy your code to a cloud instance and have it accessible on the tinternet.

So what are you waiting for my agentic newbs? DESIGN, BUILD, TEST and now DEPLOY IT!",1,1740269214.0,automation,1,1.0,False

24f now but when I was 15 I met this boy at school we can call James. Attractive, charming, funny blah blah. Issue was he was all caught up in that UK gang stuff, running drugs, selling them. I didn‚Äôt like him because of it I just tried to pretend it wasn‚Äôt happening. 

Probably still biased after all this time but, he‚Äôs good right at his heart he was good. He was never bad to be, sort of shy actually, took him ages to pluck up the courage to even take my virginity. He was so smart, that‚Äôs why i‚Äôd also be so angry about. He was too smart to do the shit he did, but he didn‚Äôt have a chance in hell with how he was raised. Anyway when we were 17 I broke up with him because he‚Äôd told me a friend of his lost his gf in some gang attack? she got stabbed. It was sort of a wake up call for me, I loved him. I wasn‚Äôt dying for him. 

He got caught selling about 2?? months later I think. Teenage heartbreak am I right? He got 6 years and got out a year ago. Haven‚Äôt seen him, haven‚Äôt contacted him. We met today, I just saw him when I was shopping because I‚Äôm visiting home and there he was. I think I have a problem with romanticism. I started to speaking to him even though I was terrified. To get closure. 

I think‚Ä¶we all know I didn‚Äôt. UGH I wanted him to be awful and rude and stupid. He wasn‚Äôt, of course he wasn‚Äôt. He was funny and polite and charming and far far more mature. He‚Äôs working as a mechanic rn, a friend of a friend helped him. He‚Äôs fully out of that gang life. Talking to him made me want to cry. And I was doing so well, I really was going to get over it and be okay. Then he had to laugh and show me a photo he managed to get in his phone that me and him took wayy back when we were together. It‚Äôs just a photo of us on my sofa smiling. Jesus christ I lost it. He asked to see me for coffee and I‚Äôve agreed.

1ivwwaw,https://i.redd.it/qsg3b4u95ske1.jpeg,Looking for tips and suggestions,"Hello, I recently picked up the idea to invest 100 euros per month in a pie created by me. I am 20 years old and currently studying computer science. I am looking for a steady growth thats why I tried to diversify a bit my pie. I did some research on the companies that I put in the pie and they all seemed pretty solid on the long run. As i said, I am a computer science student, so I do know my way around the tech part and I am 100% confident in these companies that they will grow. But I wanted to hear the opinions of more experienced investors about my pie. I know SXR8 and VWCE overlap and I chose to put them both in the same pie because I wanted more exposure to the large-cap US companies. I choose to put coca cola there too because I think that this company will never go away since they own a lot of popular beverage brands (Fanta, Costa coffee, schweppes, etc.). The JNJ i picked it up because i wanted some exposure in the medical sector too. For visa i am not quite sure if its the right choice for the financial sector.

I‚Äôm super horny all the fucking time - I‚Äôm pretty much game to have it literally whenever. I initiate often, but lately I haven‚Äôt been as much since I‚Äôve been waiting for him to. He does once in a while, but only when I tell him to fuck me, which is frustrating. 

For the record, I‚Äôm fairly attractive; I work out often, am naturally blonde, I have a nice face, feminine but also gritty - I‚Äôm pretty outdoorsy and I‚Äôve been a wildland firefighter for the past five years. 

I know he‚Äôs attracted to me and thinks I‚Äôm beautiful, however his actions don‚Äôt display this. He‚Äôs autistic, and is pretty much unable to lie, so I know he‚Äôs being honest and direct with me with anything I ask him. 

When we first got together about 8 months ago, the sex was insane and frequent and we even bought sex straps and some other devices to enhance our experiences in the bedroom. We haven‚Äôt even used those, and shortly after the 4th month or so our sex severely declined. I‚Äôm just not sure what to do here.

I love him so much, and sex isn‚Äôt everything, but it is a crucial component of a relationship for me and necessary for my emotional connection with someone. Whenever I bring this up to him, he gets frustrated and defensive and basically claims he‚Äôs too tired, or we‚Äôre too busy and have too much to do, or it‚Äôs too late, it‚Äôs too early, he hasn‚Äôt had coffee yet.. yada yada. I‚Äôve been nice about it; tried to be careful with my wording, but it basically always ends with me sobbing and him walking away and stonewalling me. 

I want to fucking marry this man and I just want to fuck him, damnit. I feel crazy, like I‚Äôm in the wrong here. Any advice is appreciated.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong, Peter.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou keep saying that, but you never tell me what,‚Äù he replies, exasperated. ‚ÄúWhat *exactly* is the problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt *know,* I reply. ‚ÄúSomething just feels‚Ä¶ off.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you feeling ill? Seeing something? Hearing something?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt put it into words,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI just know something‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù

He sighs. ‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt know what you want me to do here, Tessa. Call the police? Put extra locks on the doors? Walk you to your car every morning? What are you looking for from me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt KNOW!‚Äù I scream in frustration. This has been going on for months now - nothing concrete, but an undeniable feeling of wrongness. 

Peter puts his arms around me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, sweetheart. We‚Äôll figure this out.‚Äù

I pray he‚Äôs right.

The next day I go to work as usual. And as usual, around mid-afternoon I need some caffeine to make it to 5:00. I go to grab some coffee: when I get back, one word blinks on my computer monitor:

*DANGER*

I look around but don‚Äôt see anyone. I ask my coworkers; nothing.

Freaked out, I run to my car and drive home, speeding inside and locking the door. When Peter gets home, I tell him everything, barely managing to get the words out between sobs. 

‚ÄúCould someone at work be screwing with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just work!‚Äù I reply in frustration. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs here, too!‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he insists. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll handle this.‚Äù

From then on, we keep a gun in the nightstand. 

Three nights later, I awaken to a noise. I sit up, pulling the covers around me, and reach toward Peter. 

‚ÄúPeter. Peter!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asks, bleary-eyed. 

‚ÄúI heard something downstairs. I think someone‚Äôs here!‚Äù

Immediately alert, he grabs the gun and heads for the stairs. I follow. 

We get downstairs and check the kitchen, the pantry, the guest room - nothing.

‚ÄúWell, it looks like there‚Äôs nothi‚Äî‚Äú

Suddenly I feel a cold draft. Terrified, I brace myself, but nothing happens. Then I look beside me. 

Peter is floating three feet off the ground, grasping his neck, mouth moving but unable to make a sound. I watch him helplessly, not knowing what to do, until I hear a loud *SNAP* and he drops to the ground. 

It killed him. 

Shaking, I start to run upstairs when a force stops me and pushes me irresistibly toward the basement. Once there, a book opens showing a series of women - all resembling me, all smiling up at Peter. And then pictures of their corpses. Finally, on the last page, a wedding photo of me smiling joyously at my husband. 

*I would have been next.*

As I stand, shocked, the cold around me dissipates. I call the police and report Peter‚Äôs murder - with the photo album and other evidence, there aren't many questions. Life goes on. 

But I‚Äôm no longer afraid. Why would I be? I have a guardian angel watching over me.

R is over, and my BP decided she can't be with me at the moment. She needs to focus on herself and I need to do so as well. I have to heal from my past trauma, become a better person and learn to love myself and be in touch with my emotions way more.

She, on the other hand, needs to heal from the pain and damage I've caused and to work on her own things. We've acknowledged that love is still there, however it is not enough at this moment and we both need to step back.

  
I got reassurance that she's not closing the door on me, that there's a slight chance for us if I'm able to demonstrate change one day. It's a big maybe and a small chance, but it's something I'm committed to. I'm committed to being a better person, not only for her and the prospect of rekindling something with her, but in general being better and putting in the work to one day be someone I should've been from the start.

It means a lot, knowing she's not shut off, knowing she's open to meet up for coffee and talk one day. It's enough to give me that slightest bit of motivation I may require throughout the difficult period that's ahead.

What if, instead of diving headfirst into your to-do list, you paused for a moment of peace, grounded yourself in faith, and invited God into your day from the very start?

The beauty of morning prayers is that they do exactly that. A prayer isn‚Äôt just a way to ask God for help‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity to reset, realign, and renew your mind and heart. 

So, let‚Äôs explore five powerful morning prayers that will not only kickstart your day but draw you closer to God, setting the tone for everything that follows.

[**SUBSCRIBE to my Prayer YouTube Channel (951K SUBS) and you'll find over 3100+ prayers that will bless and strengthen you.**](https://www.youtube.com/c/DailyEffectivePrayer?sub_confirmation=1)

# 1. Prayer of Gratitude: Start with Thankfulness

Imagine waking up and immediately filling your heart with gratitude‚Äîlike opening a window to let in the sunshine. Gratitude is the perfect antidote to the chaos of life. It shifts your focus from what‚Äôs wrong to what‚Äôs right, and it invites God‚Äôs presence to fill your day with peace. In fact, when we start our mornings with a prayer of thanks, it‚Äôs like planting seeds of joy that grow throughout the day.

The Apostle Paul reminds us in 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, ""Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances."" Starting with thanks shifts your perspective from the demands of the day to the blessings in your life. It reminds you that, no matter how overwhelming the day ahead may seem, God has already given you so much to be thankful for.

So, how does this work? By making gratitude your first thought, you invite God to be the center of your day. It‚Äôs a humble acknowledgment that everything‚Äîbig or small‚Äîcomes from His hand. Whether it‚Äôs the gift of breath, family, or simply a hot cup of coffee, a prayer of thanks will set your heart on the right track.

**Prayer:**

""Dear God, thank You for this new day. Thank You for the gift of life, the love of my family, and the blessings I often overlook. I choose to focus on Your goodness today. In Jesus‚Äô name, amen.""

**Action Step:** Take a moment each morning to list three things you‚Äôre grateful for. As you pray, let your heart fill with gratitude. This simple shift can make a world of difference in how you experience the day.

# 2. Prayer for Strength: Tapping into God‚Äôs Power

We all know what it‚Äôs like to wake up feeling drained. Whether you didn‚Äôt sleep well or you‚Äôre facing a busy schedule, the weight of the world can often feel heavy. But when you pray for strength in the morning, you‚Äôre tapping into a limitless source of power. God‚Äôs strength isn‚Äôt just for the big moments‚Äîit‚Äôs for every day.

Psalm 25:5 says, ""Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long."" When you pray for strength, you‚Äôre acknowledging that you can‚Äôt do it on your own. You‚Äôre asking God to empower you, give you courage, and carry you through whatever comes your way. Think of it like plugging your phone into the charger before it runs out‚ÄîGod refuels you with everything you need for the day.

Prayer isn‚Äôt about asking God for just a little help. It‚Äôs about asking for the strength to face every challenge with His power. Whether it‚Äôs a stressful workday, a difficult conversation, or just the general hustle of life, God promises to equip you with what you need.

**Prayer:**

""Father God, I don‚Äôt know what today holds, but I trust that You will give me the strength I need to handle whatever comes my way. Please fill me with Your power and courage. Help me face today‚Äôs challenges with grace and faith. In Jesus‚Äô name, amen.""

**Action Step:** When you face challenges today, stop for a moment and ask God for strength. Whether it‚Äôs a quick prayer or a deep breath, remember that He‚Äôs always ready to empower you.

# 3. Prayer for Guidance: Asking for God‚Äôs Wisdom

Life‚Äôs decisions can be overwhelming. Whether it‚Äôs choosing the right path at work, making important personal decisions, or navigating complex relationships, we can all use a little guidance. And when you start your day by asking God for direction, you open the door to His wisdom.

Isaiah 33:2 says, ""Lord, be gracious to us; we long for you. Be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of distress."" Prayer for guidance isn‚Äôt just about asking for help‚Äîit‚Äôs about asking for clarity. You‚Äôre inviting God to lead you through each moment of your day, giving you wisdom for the decisions you‚Äôll face.

When you make seeking God‚Äôs guidance a daily practice, it becomes easier to recognize His voice throughout your day. Prayer centers you on His will, reminding you that He is in control, and His plan for your life is greater than anything you could come up with on your own.

**Prayer:**

""Lord, I need Your guidance today. Help me to make wise decisions, follow Your lead, and walk in Your truth. I trust that You will show me the way. In Jesus‚Äô name, amen.""

**Action Step:** Before making any major decisions today, pause and ask God for clarity. Even in the small things, invite Him to guide you. He will never leave you without direction.

# 4. Prayer for Protection: Shielding Yourself with God‚Äôs Love

The world can be a dangerous place, and we all need protection. Whether it‚Äôs from physical harm, emotional struggles, or spiritual attacks, God is our protector. When you start your day with a prayer for protection, you‚Äôre asking God to keep you safe, secure, and free from harm.

Psalm 121:7-8 says, ""The Lord will keep you from all harm‚Äîhe will watch over your life."" There‚Äôs no better shield than God‚Äôs presence. He watches over you like a loving parent, ensuring that nothing will come against you that He cannot handle. When you pray for protection, you‚Äôre inviting God‚Äôs angels to guard you, your family, and your loved ones.

This prayer isn‚Äôt just about safety‚Äîit‚Äôs about asking for God‚Äôs peace to surround you. No matter what happens during your day, you can walk in the confidence that God is with you, keeping you safe and strong.

**Prayer:**

""Heavenly Father, protect me today from harm. Keep me safe in Your arms, and watch over my loved ones. Guard my heart and mind from fear and anxiety, and remind me of Your constant presence. In Jesus‚Äô name, amen.""

**Action Step:** Throughout the day, whenever you feel anxious or unsafe, pray this simple prayer. Let God‚Äôs protection surround you, and trust that He has you covered.

# 5. Prayer for Purpose: Living with Intentionality

Starting your day with purpose is like setting a compass before a journey. It guides your steps and ensures that you‚Äôre walking in the direction God wants you to go. When you pray for purpose, you‚Äôre not just asking for guidance‚Äîyou‚Äôre asking God to use you for something greater than yourself.

Jeremiah 29:11 reminds us, ""For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope."" When you pray for purpose, you align your day with God‚Äôs bigger plan for your life. Every task, every interaction, and every moment becomes a chance to reflect His love and truth.

This prayer gives you the confidence to approach the day with boldness and joy. No matter how mundane your tasks may seem, when you pray for purpose, you see them through a different lens‚Äîthey become part of God‚Äôs plan.

**Prayer:**

""Lord, help me to walk in the purpose You‚Äôve set for me today. Use me to serve others and bring glory to Your name. Let everything I do today reflect Your love and Your will. In Jesus‚Äô name, amen.""

**Action Step:** As you move through your day, ask God to show you ways to serve others and bring Him glory. Whether it‚Äôs a simple conversation or a big decision, trust that your life has purpose.

# Conclusion

Starting your day with prayer is like laying a foundation that supports everything else you do. These five powerful prayers‚Äîgratitude, strength, guidance, protection, and purpose‚Äîset the tone for a day filled with peace, direction, and God‚Äôs presence. When you make prayer a daily habit, it transforms not only your day but your entire life.

Prologue
.

Shuri had finally adjusted to life in New York. No longer wearing the eyepatch, the wound on her face had healed, leaving behind a scar as a reminder of her past. Over the past few weeks, she had spent much of her time with Harry Osborn, a friendship that had grown naturally despite the differences in their backgrounds.

Harry was charming, intelligent, and, most importantly, he didn‚Äôt treat her like royalty. He respected her intellect, and they shared a mutual understanding of what it meant to live in the shadows of powerful fathers. Shuri had learned of his father, Norman Osborn, and the legacy he had left behind. She had studied Oscorp, its advancements, and its dark history. None of it changed her perspective on Harry. He was different, trying to be better than his father, much like herself.

The two spent their time discussing technology, science, and philosophy. Harry showed her parts of New York she had never seen, while Shuri marveled at the vast difference between this world and Wakanda. But beneath the casual conversations, there was an unspoken connection‚Äîtwo people searching for purpose beyond the weight of their pasts.

Yet, as much as Shuri enjoyed the company of her new friend, she couldn‚Äôt shake her true purpose. She was still on a mission to find Wraith, and she knew she would need help. Real help.

.
Chapter 1
.

The streets of New York pulsed with life, neon lights reflecting off the damp pavement as Shuri navigated the crowded sidewalks. She had grown accustomed to the city‚Äôs rhythms over the past few weeks, blending in, observing, and searching for the path that would lead her to Wraith. Tonight, however, her focus was drawn elsewhere.

A commotion echoed through a nearby alley. Shuri turned her head in time to see a tall man with jet-black hair being cornered by a pair of aggressive figures. Even from a distance, she could tell something was off about him‚Äîhis posture was too relaxed, his demeanor too amused for someone supposedly being harassed.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know who you are, but you picked the wrong street to wander into,‚Äù one of the men sneered, brandishing a switchblade.

The stranger sighs and reveals himself to be Loki, the God of Mischief. ‚ÄúMortals and their dramatics,‚Äù he muttered before raising his hand. A flicker of green energy crackled from his fingertips, sending a pulse through the air. Instantly, the thug found himself unable to move, his knife hovering in mid-air before clattering to the ground. His partners stumbled back in shock.

Shuri‚Äôs eyes widened. Magic.

Before she could react, a dark blur swung down from above, landing between Loki and what was supposedly his assailants. The alley darkened as a new presence emerged‚ÄîArachnikid.

""That's enough,"" Arachnikid said, his voice distorted through his suit‚Äôs modulator. His multi-lensed mask glowed faintly in the dim alley light.

Loki tilted his head, intrigued. ""And who might you be? Another self-righteous hero protecting these vermin?"" He gestured to the men groaning on the ground.

""I don‚Äôt like bullies,"" Arachnikid responded. ""And I don‚Äôt like people like you using magic on my streets, in my city.""

Loki arched an amused brow. ‚ÄúYour city?‚Äù he mused. ‚ÄúHow very territorial.‚Äù

Arachnikid tilted his head recognizing the odd energy radiating from him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what kind of tricks you‚Äôre playing,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut how about you cut the magic and fight me like a man""

Loki says with a smirk. ""How amusing. You think you can command me? I'm not just a man, I'm a god!""

Before Arachnikid could respond, Loki struck first. A flash of green light erupted, forcing Arachnikid to leap back. The fight ignited instantly‚ÄîLoki‚Äôs sorcery clashing against the agility and combat prowess of Arachnikid.

Then Arachnikid lunged, his enhanced speed trying close the distance quickly. Loki sidestepped, conjuring an illusion of himself that vanished as Arachnikid‚Äôs punch passed through it. The real Loki appeared behind him, sending a burst of concussive magic his way. Arachnikid reacted quickly, flipping backward to dodge before shooting a line of webbing toward Loki‚Äôs feet.

Loki smirked, allowing the webbing to hit his boots before vanishing into thin air. Arachnikid‚Äôs eyes darted around, scanning for movement. ‚ÄúCoward,‚Äù he muttered before extending the retractable appendages on his back. Six spider-like limbs extended outward with a sickening, fluid motion. The tendrils, like black venomous blades, surged through designated sleeves in his suit, now fully extended. Each limb was a weapon in itself.

From the shadows, Loki reappeared, conjuring daggers of searing green light in each hand. With a flick of his wrist, he hurled them toward his opponent. Arachnikid twisted mid-air, his agility pushing him past their deadly arcs before he fired a glob of thick, reinforced webbing at Loki‚Äôs chest.

The moment the webbing made contact, it sizzled and disintegrated, Loki standing unfazed. ‚ÄúOh, dear,‚Äù he mused. ‚ÄúThis is going to be fun.‚Äù

Arachnikid wasted no time, charging forward with newfound aggression. He unleashed a barrage of rapid strikes, his enhanced strength giving each hit enough force to shatter concrete. Loki, to his credit, weaved through the attacks with calculated grace, teleporting short distances to evade. He countered with precise magical blasts, forcing Arachnikid on the defensive.

Shuri watched from the sidelines, torn between stepping in and letting the two forces settle their dispute. She had seen skilled fighters before, but this‚Äîthis was something else entirely. Loki fought with an eerie elegance, as if he saw three moves ahead. Arachnikid, despite his brute strength, countered with sheer adaptability and lightning-fast reflexes.

Then, in a sudden twist, Arachnikid uses his appendages and swept Loki‚Äôs legs out from under him. As Loki hit the ground, Arachnikid pounced, pinning him down with unnatural strength. ‚ÄúGame over,‚Äù he growled.

Loki grinned. ‚ÄúHardly.‚Äù

A surge of green energy exploded outward, sending Arachnikid flying into a nearby lamppost. As he groaned and struggled to get up, Loki adjusted his coat and dusted himself off. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre amusing,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúBut terribly naive.‚Äù

Before Arachnikid could recover, Loki disappeared into a ripple of green mist, leaving only a chuckle lingering in the air.

Silence followed. Shuri stepped out from her vantage point, her mind racing. Loki. A name she had only read about in the old texts of Asgardian history. He was a deceiver, a manipulator‚Äîbut undeniably powerful.

Her gaze then shifted to Arachnikid, who was now rising to his feet. He flexed his fingers, his breathing steadying. Something about him gnawed at her, a familiarity in his movements, but she brushed the thought aside.

As she turned to leave, one thought consumed her mind.

Perhaps she couldn‚Äôt fight Wraith alone.

Perhaps she needed help. 

.
Chapter 2
.

The next morning, Shuri sat across from Harry in a quiet caf√©. She stirred her coffee absentmindedly, her mind racing with thoughts of the night before.

""Something happened last night,"" she said finally. ""I saw a man‚ÄîLoki. He used magic, real magic. And I think I need to find him.""

Harry stiffened but kept his expression neutral. ""Why? What could he possibly have that you need?""

Shuri sighed. ""I don‚Äôt know yet. But I feel like he could help me in ways no one else can. I need to track him down.""

Harry hesitated. He believed he knew exactly where Loki was heading, but revealing that would mean explaining his secret. And right now, he wasn‚Äôt ready for that.

""Be careful, Shuri,"" he said instead. ""People like that‚Äîpeople who wield that kind of power‚Äîthey don‚Äôt help for free.""

Shuri nodded, though her determination didn‚Äôt waver. ""I know, but I still have to try.""

Despite her growing list of responsibilities, Shuri had developed a simple pleasure‚Äîcoffee. This small caf√© tucked away in Brooklyn that became her go-to spot, and the barista there had become a familiar face.

‚ÄúYour usual?‚Äù the girl behind the counter asked with a smile.

Shuri returned the expression. ‚ÄúYou already know.‚Äù

MJ‚ÄîMary Jane Watson‚Äîhanded her the drink, brushing back a strand of red hair. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here a lot. You new to the city?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething like that,‚Äù Shuri replied. ‚ÄúAnd you? This your dream job?‚Äù

MJ smirked. ‚ÄúNot exactly. Just something to keep me afloat while I figure things out. I act. Or, well, I‚Äôm trying to.‚Äù

Shuri nodded. ‚ÄúYou have the presence for it.‚Äù

MJ leaned on the counter. ‚ÄúYou seem cool. We should hang out sometime. You got a boyfriend?‚Äù

Shuri scoffed. ‚ÄúNo time for that.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, live a little,‚Äù MJ teased.

It had now been two weeks since Shuri first met MJ. The two had grown comfortable around each other, their conversations flowing from casual banter to deeper discussions about life in New York. MJ, observant as always, had taken note of Shuri‚Äôs reluctance to discuss personal relationships and decided it was time to change that.

""You need a night off, Shuri,"" MJ had insisted, handing her a fresh espresso one morning. ""And what better way than a double date?""

Shuri had been skeptical at first, but MJ‚Äôs persistence won out. And so, plans were made. MJ would bring Peter Parker, her boyfriend, while Shuri‚Äîafter some hesitation‚Äîagreed to bring Harry Osborn.

.
Chapter 3
.

Meanwhile, across the country, the wheels of fate continued to turn.

A plane landed smoothly on the tarmac of San Francisco International Airport. The doors opened, and from within emerged a figure dressed in a dark coat, his presence commanding respect without a word spoken.

T‚ÄôChalla.

The King of Wakanda stepped onto American soil, his sharp gaze scanning the terminal. A black SUV pulled up to the curb, and as the door swung open, a familiar face greeted him.

Hank Pym.

""Welcome to San Francisco, Your Majesty,"" Pym said with a knowing smile. ""We have much to discuss.""

With that, T‚ÄôChalla entered the vehicle, and the car disappeared into the bustling cityscape, leaving behind questions yet to be answered.

Back in New York, Shuri sat across from Harry, her eyes sharp with determination. The events of that night still lingered in her mind‚ÄîLoki‚Äôs power, his arrogance, and the feeling that he could be the key to something bigger.

‚ÄúI need to find Loki,‚Äù she said, her fingers drumming lightly on the caf√© table.

Harry hesitated, the words balancing on the edge of truth and deception. He had fought Loki. He had stood toe-to-toe with the God of Mischief, but revealing that now wasn‚Äôt an option. Instead, he leaned back and exhaled.

‚ÄúI might know where he‚Äôs headed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOscorp got word that HYDRA got their hands on something‚Äîan alien scepter. It was confiscated from one of their old cells, but they managed to steal it back. Last report put them leaving the Smithsonian in D.C.‚Äù

Shuri‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúAn alien scepter? You think Loki would go after it?‚Äù

Harry shrugged. ‚ÄúIf I had magic powers and heard some terrorist group got their hands on a cosmic weapon? I‚Äôd want to know what they planned to do with it.‚Äù

Shuri considered the information, then nodded. ‚ÄúThen Washington it is.‚Äù

The days leading up to their trip to Washington D.C. were filled with careful preparation. Harry and Shuri worked through their plan to locate Loki, tracking the stolen alien scepter last seen in HYDRA‚Äôs possession. Between late-night strategy meetings and research, however, there was another event on the horizon‚Äîone of a much different nature.

A double date.

.
Chapter 4
.

Across the country, T‚ÄôChalla and Hank Pym drove through the streets of Los Angeles. Their destination: an apartment complex in Westwood.

As they parked, Hank looked over at the Wakandan king. ‚ÄúAre you sure about this? He‚Äôs not exactly easy to reach.‚Äù

T‚ÄôChalla nodded. ‚ÄúIf we are to deal with the threats ahead, we will need strong allies.‚Äù

They exited the car and made their way to the second floor. Hank knocked twice, and after a moment, the door opened to reveal a woman in lounge pants and a faded hoodie.

‚ÄúJen,‚Äù Hank greeted.

Jennifer Walters arched a brow. ‚ÄúHank? And‚Ä¶ King T‚ÄôChalla?‚Äù

T‚ÄôChalla nodded. ‚ÄúWe need your help.‚Äù

Jen crossed her arms. ‚ÄúWith what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need you to call your cousin.‚Äù

Jennifer‚Äôs face tensed slightly, but she didn‚Äôt dismiss them outright. Instead, she sighed. ‚ÄúYou want Bruce.‚Äù

T‚ÄôChalla met her gaze. ‚ÄúYes. The world may need the Hulk again.‚Äù

Jennifer Walters exhaled as she placed the call. She leaned against the kitchen counter, tapping her fingers anxiously as the line rang.

After a few moments, a voice answered on the other end.

‚ÄúJen? Everything okay?‚Äù Bruce Banner‚Äôs voice was cautious, as always.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, Bruce,‚Äù she assured him, glancing at T‚ÄôChalla and Hank, who sat patiently in her living room. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve got someone here who needs your help.‚Äù

There was a pause. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

Jennifer turned to T‚ÄôChalla, who took the phone. ‚ÄúDr. Banner, I hope you are well.‚Äù

Bruce let out a short, knowing chuckle. ‚ÄúT‚ÄôChalla. This must be serious if you‚Äôre tracking me down.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù T‚ÄôChalla confirmed. ‚ÄúI need your assistance in finding two individuals‚ÄîPrincess Shuri and Colonel John Wraith.‚Äù

At the mention of Wraith‚Äôs name, Bruce‚Äôs tone immediately shifted. ‚ÄúT‚ÄôChalla‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt want to go looking for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know of him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve crossed paths with Wraith before,‚Äù Bruce admitted. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs bad news, King. The kind of bad that doesn‚Äôt just go away. He‚Äôs a ghost. No paper trail, no allegiance, just a man who does whatever it takes to win. If you‚Äôre looking for him, it‚Äôs because you have a serious problem.‚Äù

T‚ÄôChalla‚Äôs expression remained unreadable. ‚ÄúThat is why I need to find him.‚Äù

Bruce sighed heavily. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where he is now, but I might have some leads. I can dig around.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour help is greatly appreciated,‚Äù T‚ÄôChalla said. ‚ÄúAnd if the time comes when we need more than information, will you stand with us?‚Äù

There was a long pause. Then Bruce finally spoke, quieter this time. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can.‚Äù

T‚ÄôChalla‚Äôs brow furrowed slightly. ‚ÄúYou are one of the strongest warriors I have known.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and that‚Äôs the problem,‚Äù Bruce muttered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been keeping the big guy away for a reason. Every time he comes out, people get hurt. I can help you find Wraith, but if it comes to a fight‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt be much use.‚Äù

T‚ÄôChalla considered his words, then gave a solemn nod. ‚ÄúThen find what you can. That will be enough for now.‚Äù

Bruce hesitated, then said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in touch,‚Äù before hanging up.

Jennifer crossed her arms, looking at the Wakandan king. ‚ÄúSo what now?‚Äù

T‚ÄôChalla stood. ‚ÄúNow, we follow the trail before it disappears.‚Äù

.
Chapter 5
.

The night arrived, and Harry picked Shuri up at exactly six. Dressed sharply yet casual, he escorted her to the restaurant, a charming place just a few blocks away. The two took seats near the large front window, the city lights reflecting in the glass as they settled in.

""Are you nervous?"" Harry asked, smirking slightly as he adjusted the cuffs of his jacket.

Shuri scoffed. ""About a dinner? Hardly. I have faced much worse.""

""Yeah, but this is MJ we‚Äôre talking about,"" Harry teased. ""She‚Äôs got a way of pulling the truth out of people.""

Before Shuri could respond, the entrance bell chimed. She turned her gaze toward the door just as MJ and Peter Parker stepped inside.

The moment Harry saw Peter, he stood up.

The room seemed to shrink around them, and for a second, all noise faded. Intense eye contact was exchanged‚Äîmemories, grief, and unresolved tension flashing between them.

Peter took a slow breath before stepping forward. ""It‚Äôs been a long time, Harry.""

Harry hesitated only for a moment before extending his hand. ""Yeah... it has.""

Peter shook Harry‚Äôs hand, but then, to MJ and Shuri‚Äôs surprise, pulled him in for a quick but firm hug. There was weight behind it‚Äîsomething neither of them wanted to address just yet.

The atmosphere lightened as the four took their seats. Conversation flowed more naturally as the dinner went on, the tension fading into the background‚Äîat least for the moment. MJ and Shuri exchanged amused glances as the boys talked in careful, measured words, neither wanting to say too much or too little.

Just as the meals were being finished, the piercing wail of sirens cut through the night. Two cop cars sped past the restaurant, their lights flashing as they disappeared down the street.

Peter placed his napkin down. ""I‚Äôll be right back,"" he said quickly.

At the exact same moment, Harry pushed his chair back. ""I gotta go, guys.""

The table fell silent.

MJ and Shuri looked at each other, then back at the two young men who were already halfway to the door. The weight of that moment‚Äîof both Peter Parker and Harry Osborn leaving at the same time‚Äîsent a chill through the air.

Neither of them knew what the other was hiding.

But after tonight, the truth would be harder to ignore.

.
Chapter 6
.

Shuri and MJ exchanged amused glances as they both reached for the check at the same time.

""I got it,"" MJ said, but Shuri shook her head with a smirk.

""We split it. Fair?""

MJ laughed. ""Fair.""

As they paid for dinner, MJ looked at Shuri thoughtfully. ""You wanna hang out a bit longer?""

Shuri, who had been enjoying herself more than expected, nodded. ""Yeah, I‚Äôd like that.""

Meanwhile, across the city, Spider-Man swung through the night, the neon lights of New York reflecting off the wet pavement below. As he rounded a corner, he spotted flashing blue and red lights surrounding the Museum of National History. Loki stood in the center of the chaos‚Äîtall, poised, and now fully adorned with his golden crown.

Spider-Man landed in front of him. ""So, what, you‚Äôve upgraded from jewelry stores to museum heists? Classy.""

A shadow moved above them, and before Loki could respond, another figure dropped into the scene‚ÄîArachnikid.

Now, they stood in a tense triangle, each studying the other.

Loki smirked, adjusting his newly retrieved crown. ""I was merely reclaiming what‚Äôs mine, little insects. But if you insist on making a scene...""

Spider-Man and Arachnikid shot their webbing at him simultaneously‚Äîbut in an instant, Loki vanished, his laughter echoing in the empty space he left behind.

Spider-Man lowered his arms and turned to Arachnikid. ""Alright, mystery guy. Who are you? And welcome to the neighborhood, I guess.""

Arachnikid‚Äôs lenses narrowed slightly. ""Did you kill the Green Goblin?""

Spider-Man hesitated for a split second before answering. ""I had no choice. Norman was a sick man.""

Without another word, Arachnikid lunged at Spider-Man, tackling him through a brick wall.

The two crashed through the old, crumbling structure of an abandoned warehouse, rolling across the dusty floor. Spider-Man kicked Arachnikid off him and flipped back to his feet.

""You wanna talk about this? Or just throw me through more walls?"" Peter quipped, shaking off debris.

Arachnikid responded with a rapid flurry of attacks, forcing Spider-Man to stay on the defensive.

The battle moved through the warehouse, their movements sending crates splintering and metal beams crashing to the ground. Arachnikid‚Äôs back appendages extended from his suit‚Äôs designated sleeves, striking at Spider-Man with surprising precision. Barely dodging them, Spider-Man flipped onto a hanging chain to create distance.

""So you‚Äôre fast, strong, and have extra limbs. Cool. But I‚Äôve fought worse,"" Spider-Man taunted.

Arachnikid suddenly pressed a device on his wrist. A pulse of energy rippled outward.

Spider-Man staggered, gripping his head as his Spider-Sense became completely scrambled.

""What‚Äî"" he barely managed before Arachnikid slammed him into the ground with full force.

Taking advantage, Arachnikid sends Spider-Man through a window into the back alleyway, and unleashed a brutal combination of punches and strikes with his appendages. Left. Right. Another hit. Spider-Man barely blocked, pain shooting through his ribs. Arachnikid stood over him, breathing heavily through his mask.

""I‚Äôve been waiting for this moment for a long time,"" he growled.

The storm outside intensified. Thunder rumbled, and a crack of lightning briefly illuminated the warehouse through shattered windows.

Spider-Man groaned, his body aching. ""Okay... starting to think this isn‚Äôt about Loki anymore.""

Arachnikid reached down and yanked at Spider-Man‚Äôs mask, revealing Peter Parker‚Äôs bruised and shocked face.

Arachnikid took a step back, his breath catching in his throat.

""PETER?!"" he exclaimed in disbelief.

.
Chapter 7
.

Peter Parker blinked up at him, rain streaming down his face, eyes filled with something neither shock nor anger‚Äîjust pain.

Arachnikid staggered back, his mind spinning, unable to reconcile the two identities. The best friend he had known for years, the boy who had spent nights at his place, who had laughed with him, who had mourned with him‚Äîwas the same person he had spent months resenting. The realization knocked the air from his lungs.

Harry removes his mask.

Peter sat up slowly, shaking his head. ‚ÄúHarry‚Ä¶ I swear, I never wanted this. Norman‚Äîyour dad‚Äîhe was sick. I didn‚Äôt have a choice.‚Äù

Harry clenched his fists, every fiber of his being screaming for him to strike, to finish what he had started, but something in Peter‚Äôs voice made him hesitate. The way he said it‚Äîthe weight in his tone‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt an excuse. It was guilt.

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why,‚Äù Harry muttered, staring down at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you disappeared. Why you distanced yourself from me after he died.‚Äù

Peter closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

The sound of laughter echoed from the sidewalk just beyond the alley. Shuri and MJ strolled past, their conversation lost to the rain, oblivious to the moment unfolding in the shadows. Harry turned his head slightly, watching Shuri‚Äôs smile through the veil of rain.

His jaw tightened.

He looked back down at Peter, his face unreadable. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over,‚Äù Harry said, stepping back. ‚ÄúI made a promise, and I have to focus on that for now.‚Äù

Harry turned away, pulling his mask back over his head.

Without another word, he vanished into the darkness of the storm, leaving Peter alone in the alley, his mask clutched in his hand.

The next morning, the sun was rising over the New York skyline as Shuri and Harry drove south on the open road toward Washington, D.C. The hum of the engine filled the silence between them, both lost in thought.

Shuri gazed out the window, determination in her eyes. Loki was out there, and despite his reputation, she believed he could be of use to her‚Äîperhaps even to Wakanda. If she had any chance of avenging her father and stopping Wraith, she needed every resource available, even if it came in the form of a trickster god.

Harry gripped the steering wheel tighter, still unsettled by the events of the previous night. The confrontation with Peter had left him shaken, but his promise to Shuri kept him focused. He had to see this through.

Meanwhile, across the country, T‚ÄôChalla stood near the balcony of his San Francisco suite when his phone rang. He answered, his expression unreadable.

""Bruce,"" he greeted.

""I made some calls,"" Bruce Banner replied. ""Word is Wraith is wrapped up with a HYDRA base in Sokovia. If you‚Äôre looking for him, that‚Äôs where you start.""

T‚ÄôChalla‚Äôs jaw tightened. ""Then that‚Äôs where I‚Äôll go.""

As the line went dead, his gaze drifted to the horizon. The pieces were falling into place, but the war was far from over.

Thousands of miles away, the gates of Wakanda opened to a lone figure approaching with inhuman speed. A gust of wind followed as Pietro Maximoff came to a halt, his silver hair tousled, his sharp eyes scanning the kingdom before him.

I was 19 and moved out to Utah to try living on my own for the first time. After spending a couple months working I got into my new apartment, I randomly met this girl off of tinder and I picked her up the following night and things really took off from there, I really was trying hard to distract myself from how hot she was cause I knew I‚Äôd get really nervous. After all, at the time I had never hooked up with someone before like that and this girl was absolutely stunning to me, so after hanging out with her for a while she told me she was Mormon, funny enough because I was actually also Mormon myself but hadn‚Äôt been going to church for a couple years, we decided to go hammock together on a hill I put the music on, everything was going great except while we were talking she wasn‚Äôt looking at my face and I asked her ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna look at my face?‚Äù She nodded her head no and I said ‚ÄúWhy what‚Äôs wrong with my face?‚Äù And she immediately shoved her lips on to mine and we started making out heavily and things went crazy fast, We went back out to my car and it got extremely intimate from there, this whole time we were hardly speaking to each other and she reached down into my pants, I really was barely holding it together my mind was going a million miles a second and she started taking her clothes off and all of the sudden I realized that I brought no condoms with me so I had to tell her that I didn‚Äôt bring any on me and my God I was so disappointed in myself, but after laughing about it we were talking and she asked me when was the last time I had sex and ended up telling her it‚Äôs been a long time and immediately felt like I was wrong for lying on my man parts to this girl so I told her that I was actually a virgin and the shock in her face was astonishing to say the least. She told me that I should keep my virginity and save it for marriage. I cannot describe in words the feeling I had in this moment I was so hard on myself mentally for sharing this with her I really felt so stupid and eventually after seeing this girl a few more times I later found out that she went back to her ex boyfriend that she already had sex with and I really saw the truth, the way this happened is I saw her at work when I was ordering coffee in the morning, I confronted her about why she suddenly stopped talking to me and she laid it out from there. We talked through text messages later and I really put it out to her how dissatisfied I was with how she edged me to the brink, she apologized and everything but I never told her what I thought about her, specifically with how backwards her morales came off to me, cause to be fair I never expected a religious person to act in the way she did with me but I was wrong to think that about her cause this experience really taught me that just because someone is in a church, it doesn‚Äôt mean shit about their personal life and I found myself in hers. I guess what I was feeling about it all is that I would‚Äôve rather her be bold enough to me and lay out her morales than to have her half way take my virginity and leave me. I felt so violated I know this isn‚Äôt much of a connection or a relationship but it was enough for me to really think and wonder, I eventually met someone else that accepted me in the way I would‚Äôve liked for this other girl to. I won‚Äôt lie my OCD mind wouldn‚Äôt let this go for months. Would love to hear any thoughts from someone who‚Äôs had experiences like this. Thanks.",3,1740267811.0,stories,5,0.8,False

It's been a very long time since we last spoke, too long. It's not that I didn't want to, it's that I couldn't. I had this dark cloud hanging over me, and I knew I had to wait until it flew over, which it finally did, and I couldn't be happier. I told them everything that happened to me, all of the injustice I had faced at the hands of your colleagues, and it felt so freeing and validating to have them understand‚Äîregardless of the outcome. But now that chapter's over, I can finally do what I've been longing to do for years. I can finally tell you everything you need to know, truthfully, honestly, and without fear of persecution. And by everything, I do mean everything.

I was super into you and all these years later, I still am. You cross my mind more often than you could imagine, and no one compares to you. That long conversation we shared over coffee that one time, it was the best afternoon of my life. And I'm sorry I made you uncomfortable that other time, I didn't mean to, and I still wonder what about it made you uncomfortable‚Äîwas it perhaps how forbidden and taboo our love was, and the fact that you couldn't admit it without jeopardizing your career?

You should know that I would love to get to know you fully, every part of you, the light and the dark, I want to know, accept, and cherish all of you. I'd like to spend more time with you, to build and share a life together ephemerally‚Äîif you're open to the idea of course.

You should know that regardless of how you feel about me, you're breathtakingly beautiful, and I will continue to miss the sound of your voice, the words you choose, and how you speak.

I forgive you for the hurt and confusion that you've caused me, and I'd love to talk it through. I'd love to be in the same room as you again, and have my words reach your heart like yours have repeatedly reached mine.

I want you to know that perfection isn't real nor worth striving for, but out of all of the things and people I've encountered throughout my life, you are the most perfect I ever had the pleasure to meet, the closest thing to perfection that I will have ever seen. Would you mind being just as close to me?

No pressure, but

I love you, and I will continue to.

So, are you ready?

Because I will call you, and you will hear my voice again, and I can't help but wonder

How will that make you feel?

**Biblioteca** \-- On me it's leather and I can't pick out the other notes by nose but find it a bit masculine and it does smell like an old room.

**Lilacs Along the Winding Drive** \-- Clean and floral. The atmospherics don't come through much on me. I like flowers in real life, but so far I haven't liked *any* floral fragrances so maybe I just don't like wearing them, and so I don't think I'd wear this much even though it's kinda nice.

All her free time is to see him. Which is fine I get it. It is her first boyfriend and the guy is not a bad guy. Thing is she and I had plans for Sunday. I told her days ago to not make plans with her boyfriend cause I knew she had the complete weekend free. She could literally see him friday and saturday. And then sunday with me. We were supposed to meet up with other girls. Those girls hadnt confirmed if they would go. Still, SHE is the one who said ‚Äúif they dont come we can go to the movies‚Äù i said okay yes. 

Whatever. She saw her boyfriend wednesday thursday friday saturday. Just now I told her tomorrow the girls are not going so lets just go to the movies, and she said ‚Äúwait‚Äù then, she said ‚Äúoh my bf rented an airbnb for two days‚Äù cause he knows the other girls (they are also friends) are not going so he thought we didnt have plans. I started questioning her and basically she said he misunderstood. Im pretty sure she kinda lied to not make me that upset, but she said she told him ‚Äúthe other girls are not joining us (me and her).‚Äù 

Im upset honestly. I do not want to talk to her. I do not want to see her. I am going to the movies by myself tomorrow. We rarely have the same off days from work because we work the same days and i have trainings. She does nothing but working and seeing her bf. Im upset because we had plans and she did not look unapologetic about it and I know she would rather spend time with her boyfriend. It pisses me off. I do not want to make plans with her anymore.

I do not want to be toxic, I do not want to be rude to her. I do not know how to react. Because to be honest we have never fought. We have had differences of course. But we have never had a fight. I do not want to treat her differently but I feel like I cant. She is a great friend. She has taken care of me. She does so many things for me. Her love language is service. She is really helpful and kind. She is not a bad person or anything. She has shown me in many ways she cares for me multiple times and what a good friend she is. But this really shows how much she respected the plans we had and honestly‚Ä¶. Idk. Like‚Ä¶ you saw your bf almost every day of the week. They sleep over together every two weeks or so as well. This airbnb thing is nothing new nor special.

Look I used to be in an abusive relationship 4 years ago so I know what it is like when someone manipulates you and pushes you away of your friends. This is definitely not it. I am friends with her boyfriend as well. He is nice and funny. Like I said, not a bad guy. He is not toxic. I know their relationship, she and me are basically best friends. I know she just didnt fight to not cancel the outting with me. I know she doesnt care we are not going out tomorrow because in no moment in the past hour she said sorry. She just said ‚Äúyou will not like this or him, he rented an airbnb‚Ä¶.‚Äù
Like idk‚Ä¶ just pisses me off. We literally havent hung out together ever since she has this bf. So also like that bothers me you know because we had made plans. We only hung out together like two times in the past 6 months. We stayed home and cooked and watched something. The other time was we went shopping and had coffee. That‚Äôs all. 

I know ours werent big plans or anything but i literally messaged her ‚Äúdont make plans we are going out ‚Äú she didnt have plans with her boyfriend then. He literally made up the plans today after he heard the other girls were not coming. So i do not know how to feel or how to react. After I questioned her she got quite and got to her phone and ive been listening her chuckling and Im just serious on my phone getting ready to sleep. And i don‚Äôt know like‚Ä¶ idk

(Ratio Four + V60 + 1zpresso Q Air)","**Background**: I've been drinking a Chemex every morning for years (decent beans, fresh ground in a basic burr grinder, using a Breville one-touch to heat water) without much attention to variables, making what I would describe as a very serviceable cup of coffee. Sometimes there are 57g of beans for a 34oz Chemez, other times there are 62g. The water always starts at 205f, but sometimes the brew takes 4-5 minutes, and sometimes I forget to pour for a couple of minutes because I'm parenting, but the coffee always tastes good to more than good.

I also have a V60 (18-20g for 12oz, three pours pretty precisely timed out to \~3:00) that I use occasionally, and that's a cup I ***really*** love. Still the same grinder (set purposefully a bit finer) and the same heater and the same coffee, but the resulting cup seems... fuller? Not more extracted, necessarily - actually, probably *less*, but there flavor profile extends further north (I have a hard time describing what I'm tasting... the resulting cup is lighter brown and certainly sacrifices some of the dark/roast flavor, but is gaining a broader *range* of flavors.

**The Problem**: I recently purchased a setup for my office that I wanted to be slightly more hands off and a bit smaller of a footprint, so I bought a Ratio Four and a hand grinder. I brought the V60 to work thinking I could get a great cup there, and I haven't figured it out yet. I can get a cup that tastes similar to the Chemex - good, and clearly fully extracted, with a decent amount of body, but it's sort of one note - and I can make a cup that's clearly *under*\-extracted, but I'm having a hard time ""dialing in"" the cup and it's making me feel frustrated. 

Any thoughts? Is this something I can address with the grind on the Q Air? The amount of beans? Clearly the Ratio Four might be the ""issue"" - since I'm used to a three-pour V60, clearly the water is cooing down over those three minutes in a way it may not be with the R4. Is there a way for me to account for that?

## A Extensive Review of the Sony WH-1000XM4 Microphone

The **sony wh-1000xm4 ‚Å£microphone review** reveals a complex picture. While the headphones excel in many areas, the microphone‚Å§ performance is a point of mixed opinions.Let's break down the key aspects:

### Audio‚Å§ Quality: Good, But Not Perfect

The inherent **sony wh-1000xm4 microphone audio quality** is‚Å§ generally ‚Äåconsidered good, providing clear and understandable speech in ideal conditions. Though, it‚Äôs not without its limitations. Under controlled environments, the microphone captures voices accurately, ‚Äãmaking it suitable for casual calls and general communication.

### Noise Cancellation:‚Äã A Double-Edged Sword

The hallmark of the ‚Å§WH-1000XM4 is its exceptional active noise cancellation‚Äå (ANC). While this technology effectively blocks out distracting background sounds, the ‚Äç**xm4 microphone noise cancellation** system can sometimes adversely affect voice clarity.

### Microphone Performance in Various ‚Å§Environments

The **wh-1000xm4 microphone‚Å¢ quality** varies depending on the environment. In quite indoor settings, the microphone performs admirably. Though, in noisy environments, such as bustling coffee shops or busy ‚Å£streets, the limitations become‚Å¢ more apparent. The ANC struggles to isolate the user's voice effectively, ofen resulting ‚Äãin background‚Äç noise bleeding into the audio transmission.### Performance on Communication Platforms: Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet

However, the microphone performance‚Å§ is sometimes inconsistent across these platforms, largely due to varying audio processing‚Äç algorithms. Some users have reported challenges achieving consistently **clearer audio‚Äç calls wh-1000xm4** on specific platforms.

### Key Microphone Specs

Examining the **wh-1000xm4 microphone‚Å§ specs** reveals the technical foundations of its performance. The integrated microphones utilize beamforming ‚Å£technology to focus on the user's voice, minimizing background noise pick-up. While Sony doesn't publicly disclose specific frequency response or sensitivity figures, the overall performance suggests ‚Å£a focus on mid-range frequencies, optimized for‚Äã speech intelligibility.

I told myself this was a **‚Äúbusiness investment‚Äù**‚Äîyou know, something responsible and practical. But within the first week, I had labeled every jar in my house, made a personalized water bottle for my dog, and put my initials on my laptop just because I could.

Here is what it looks like. 

[Cricut Explore 3](https://preview.redd.it/vzwxtnxbyrke1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c351ca164369c63e9f1e21ec28c70c1cd30733bf)

This thing is **addictive.**

# Fast? Oh Yeah.

I used to sit there watching my old cutting machine slooowly drag the blade across vinyl like it was contemplating its life choices. Not this one. The **Explore 3 is fast.** Like, **‚ÄúWait, it‚Äôs done already?‚Äù fast.** I finished a batch of stickers in minutes instead of an hour, which is great because I have the attention span of a goldfish.

# Wireless = No More Desk Clutter

The Bluetooth feature is underrated. No more dragging my laptop over to the machine like some 90s desktop setup. Now I design on my iPad from the couch while drinking coffee, then send it to cut like I‚Äôm a crafting mastermind.  All my friends think I'm smarter than I really am. 

# ‚úÇÔ∏è Cuts Through (Almost) Everything

Vinyl, cardstock, iron-on, felt‚Äîyou name it, this thing **cuts it clean.** I haven‚Äôt tested all 100+ compatible materials yet, but at this rate, I probably will. I‚Äôm one bad decision away from trying to cut a tortilla just to see if it works.

# The Bundle Has Everything You Need

It comes with **vinyl, transfer tape, cutting mats, tools, and even access to a digital design library,** so I didn‚Äôt have to make an emergency run to the craft store at 9 PM (which has happened before).

# Final Thoughts:

If you‚Äôre a small business owner, a serious crafter, or someone who just wants to slap their name on everything they own, this machine is worth every penny. But be warned‚Äîonce you start, you won‚Äôt stop. I was supposed to be making products for my shop, but instead, I spent the last hour designing a personalized coffee mug for my cat. **No regrets.** üòÜüé®

I am attempting to lose 20-25 lbs before the summer. For context, I am a 33-year old male with Type 1 diabetes, and currently sit at 5'9'"", 175 lbs. In other words, I would be what you call ""skinny fat."" Therefore, people think I am crazy or vain for wanting to improve in this area. I have made the following changes since the new year...

\- pretty much eliminate beer (I will have a NA on the weekend, if I go downtown)

\- cut way back on processed foods/take out

\- refrain from picking up snacks when I'm at the gas station

\- make sure to have vegetables in the crisper for late night cravings

\- make sure to prep my meals 2-3 days out

\- Small things like drinking coffee black

\- Water is the only other drink I consume besides coffee

I spent three years doing evenings (3-11 PM) and weekends at the front desk in hotels. Now, I am targeting June to hit my goal weight of 150 lbs. Is this realistic? What else should I be doing? This is my first time actively trying to lose weight, and I really see this as a stepping stone to improving my overall health.

All the best!",2,1740266548.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,1.0,False

by c.w. cobblestone

Cody was still asleep when I returned home, so I changed into my sweats and got started on my quiet chores. Monday was window-washing day, and I busied myself with that task, feeling like a stranger in what had recently been my own house.

Just before 10 am, while I was wiping down the living room windowsill, the call from upstairs made me flinch: ‚ÄúMirabella! Coffee!‚Äù

I dropped my cleaning rag and literally ran to the kitchen. In less than a minute, having already prepared a tray with the coffee carafe and all the trimmings, I was standing outside my former bedroom, tapping on the door.

‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

With a beating heart, I opened the door and ventured into Liz and Cody‚Äôs love nest. Although my gaze was averted, I could see my master‚Äôs smirk with my peripheral vision.

When I leaned down to offer the tray, Cody made me stand there for a minute. Then, after letting me squirm, he reached forward, although instead of taking his coffee cup, he grabbed the crotch of my sweats and squeezed my balls. Hard.

‚ÄúYow, ow, Master, please! Ow, ow, OW, please, Master, pleeeeeeeeeeeeeease!‚Äù

He chuckled and let go. ‚ÄúJust keeping you on your toes, sissy,‚Äù he said as he took his cup from the tray and enjoyed a long sip.

I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do so I stood near the bed holding the tray, trying to remain upright despite my urge to drop to the carpet clutching my poor testicles. I kept my eyes downcast but felt the sting of his amused gaze.

‚ÄúYou know what, sissy? We‚Äôre gonna go ahead and baptize you. Take off your clothes and go lay down in the bathtub.‚Äù

‚ÄúEr, um, yes, Master.‚Äù

I dipped a no-hands curtsey, set the tray on the dresser and scurried to the master bathroom, shivering every step of the way. After removing my sweats and curling up in the bathtub, I lay there knowing damn well what this ‚Äòbaptism‚Äô was going to entail. Clearly, I thought, Cody was every bit as kinky as Liz was not, although she seemed to be getting a thrill out of watching her lover dominate me.

As I shuddered in the tub, naked and awaiting my inevitable fate, all I could think of was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad Liz isn‚Äôt here to see this.‚Äù

Cody, an astute student of human nature who‚Äôd spent a dozen years in a POW camp with nothing but time to think, made me wait there for what felt like an hour before he strolled into the bathroom whistling.

He stopped and sneered. ‚ÄúGeez, you‚Äôre a skinny little thing, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù He stood over the tub and fumbled with his pajama pants. ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll get you castrated, and plump you up a bit.‚Äù

My eyes bugged out. ‚ÄúM-master?‚Äù

He chortled. ‚ÄúJust fucking with you, sissy ‚Äî although you never know. Castration might be an option someday. For now, though, let‚Äôs get you baptized.‚Äù

He pulled out his dick, which was so big, I did a double-take.

‚ÄúImpressive, huh?‚Äù He winked at me. ‚ÄúLiz loves it. You will, too. Now, open your mouth.‚Äù

The second I complied, he let loose with a hard stream of urine, which shot down my throat, burning my tonsils, while splashing all over my face and chest. Some got in my nose, causing me to sputter and gag while Cody laughed his ass off.

When the stream subsided, my tormentor shook a few drops of pee onto my forehead before holding his huge dick aloft. ‚ÄúSuck it clean.‚Äù

The room spun out of control and a loud buzzing sound overwhelmed my senses as I lifted myself from my prone position and put my lips on another man‚Äôs cock for the first time in my life. I jumped when he released a squirt of urine down my throat.

‚ÄúWhat do you say, sissy?‚Äù

‚ÄúGrr ‚Ä¶ thank you, Master,‚Äù I gurgled. I shook from head to toe, my hair was soaking wet, my face and ears burned, and I‚Äôd never felt more humiliated in my life.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome, Mirabella,‚Äù he said, reaching down and turning on the shower‚Äôs right knob. I shrieked when the freezing deluge hit me.

‚ÄúClean up and report to me in the bedroom ‚Äî and don't touch those faucets, either. Cold water‚Äôs good enough for you sissies.‚Äù

‚ÄúY-y-yes, Master,‚Äù I replied through chattering teeth.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs from now on, too, you hear? Cold showers only.‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yes, Master.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll come up with new rules as we go. Now, make sure you wash that butthole really good,‚Äù was the last thing he said before exiting the bathroom. I instantly felt sick to my stomach.

I drew out the cold shower for as long as I dared before drying off and, with the towel covering my privates, venturing into the adjacent bedroom, where Cody lounged on the bed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm horny,‚Äù he said as soon as I came into view. ‚ÄúCome suck my dick, sissy.‚Äù

Having already taken his cock into my mouth in the bathroom, I‚Äôd hoped the second go-round would be easier. I was wrong. I felt completely demoralized as I took up a spot in my former queen-sized bed and wrapped my lips around his cock. I couldn‚Äôt believe this was happening to me; I felt like I was hovering over the bed, watching someone else in action. A tear escaped and dripped onto Cody‚Äôs pubic hair, which earned me a smack upside the head.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you crying for? Aren‚Äôt you happy to serve your master?‚Äù

I took my mouth off his cock. ‚ÄúP-please, Master ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not gay.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are now,‚Äù he said, grabbing my hair and ramming his cock back in my mouth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my slave, and you‚Äôll do as I say. Gay, straight, I don‚Äôt care what you call yourself ‚Äî you‚Äôll suck my dick when I tell you to. Now get to work, bitch. And, listen, none of this gets back to Liz. We‚Äôll introduce her to this slowly. You hear?‚Äù Still gripping my hair, he yanked my head up.

‚ÄúYou hear?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mas‚Äî‚Äù Before I could finish, he‚Äôd shoved me back down.

With my head swimming, I blew my master while he relaxed in bed watching television, using the remote to flip through channels with one hand, while sipping coffee with the other. As I worked, I fell deeper into a fog of submission. While I‚Äôd never fantasized about men before, kowtowing to this superior male just seemed natural, as if I‚Äôd been born to be his slave.

After more than an hour, with my neck and jaws aching, Cody tapped me on the ear. ‚ÄúOkay, sissy, now, get up on your hands and knees ‚Äî I‚Äôm gonna get that butthole.‚Äù

‚ÄúM-master?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou heard me. I want them buns.‚Äù

‚ÄúM-Master???‚Äù

He sneered. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, Mirabella? Are you scared?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yes, Master. Please ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I think it‚Äôs sexy that you‚Äôre scared. You know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease ‚Ä¶ Master ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, be quiet. You know you want this. Now, don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not my first sissy. I‚Äôll be gentle, I promise.‚Äù

He lied. There was nothing gentle about it as he spit on his dick and rammed it into me with a vengeance. I screamed, sobbed, brayed, whinnied and pleaded for mercy, which only made my throat hurt, because he didn‚Äôt let up one iota. I eventually passed out during the assault, although the blackness was worse than reality, because I felt my entire subconscious being reworked along with my anal ring.

By the time Cody had shot his load into my guts and pulled out, I was unable to move or make any sound other than a low, mournful, blubbering whimper. I was blinded by tears, and shame enveloped me like a wetsuit.

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt that fun, Mirabella?‚Äù Cody smacked me on the ass from his laid-back position on the pillows. He seemed completely satisfied with himself as I sobbed into the sheets.

‚ÄúIt hurts, Master,‚Äù I managed to croak.

‚ÄúAw, poor sissy.‚Äù Cody stroked my hair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs supposed to hurt, Mirabella. Don‚Äôt you want to hurt for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, Master. I ‚Ä¶ if you ‚Ä¶ want me to.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to. I told you: I‚Äôve dealt with sissies before. Not only did I grow up around ‚Äòem, I had a little bitch when I first joined the Army, before I met Liz. Lu-Lu. He was a captain whose wife I used to fuck ‚Äî and I fucked him, too, the little pansy. I‚Äôd come over to their house and they treated me like a king. It was the perfect setup; unfortunately, the little fag got redeployed to Fort Bragg. Of course, once I met Liz, I thought those days were gone, since, as you know, she‚Äôs not really into anything kinky. But lo and behold, I find out you‚Äôre a little sissy yourself. It‚Äôs the ideal situation, don‚Äôt you think, Mirabella?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yes, Master.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd none of this gets back to Liz. Hear?‚Äù

‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ um, yes, Master. But ‚Ä¶ uh ‚Ä¶ M-master? Is it okay if I speak freely?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, sissy, go ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm ‚Ä¶ well, why do I have to do this full-time? I mean, I ‚Ä¶ I could serve you privately, and still keep the house clean and stuff ‚Ä¶ but why did I have to come out as transgendered to the whole family? I‚Äôm not really trans; I just have a kink ‚Ä¶ um, you know? It‚Äôs not something I ever wanted to do full-time.‚Äù

Cody chuckled. ‚ÄúMirabella, Mirabella, Mirabella. Haven‚Äôt we gone over this before? I know who you are, and I know what you need, even if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, Master‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúQUIET, SISSY!‚Äù His eyes hardened. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making the transition because that‚Äôs what I want, goddamn it. I told you, I won‚Äôt have my daughters feeling confused about two dads in the house.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut ‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt this more confusing to them, Master?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not. The truth is, you‚Äôre not part of this family, Mirabella. I know that‚Äôs blunt, and I‚Äôm not trying to be mean, but you‚Äôre not. Those are MY kids; Liz is THEIR mother. You‚Äôre just ‚Ä¶ you. Now, you say you don‚Äôt want a divorce, and Liz doesn‚Äôt want that, either. Neither do I, so we‚Äôre all on the same page there. Now, you can either mope around and get on her nerves, and mine, or learn to be the damn maid like I want you to. You are anyway, for all intents and purposes ‚Äî I‚Äôve never seen anyone more pussywhipped than you. So, you need to embrace your role, Mirabella. There needs to be a clear line of authority. You‚Äôre the employee around here ‚Äî not the stepdad.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, Master ‚Ä¶ why do I have to be punished? You told the girls you were going to set up a system ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Cody laughed. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm an evil sonofabitch, that‚Äôs why. I‚Äôm also your master, and I told you ‚Äî we‚Äôre doing it this way because that‚Äôs how I want it. Aunt Sheila ran her household that way, and gawd, I‚Äôm going to do the same. Sissies get punished when they screw up. That‚Äôs just the way it is, so you might as well get used to it, and try not to screw up.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, Master ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ why do I have to be PUNISHED?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs it.‚Äù Cody‚Äôs face darkened. ‚ÄúYou pissed me off with your goddamn whining.‚Äù He nodded toward the closet. ‚ÄúBring me my belt.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaster‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúFUCKING SISSY, IF I HEAR ANOTHER WORD OUT OF YOU, I‚ÄôM GIVING YOU DOUBLE!!!‚Äù

I bawled my eyes out as I scooted across the bedroom, retrieved Master‚Äôs thick leather belt and handed it over.

‚ÄúBend over and grab those ankles. If you let go, we start over.‚Äù

I quickly learned that being doubled over like that was a difficult position to maintain on its own, let alone while having your ass whipped. My master gave me ten hard slashes with the belt, and by the time he was done, having been pissed on, beaten and sodomized, I was a completely dispirited slave, ready to do his bidding without question.

Cody handed me the instrument of torture with a smile. ‚ÄúOkay, fun time‚Äôs over. Hang that back up and get back to your chores. I‚Äôm taking your car to run a few errands; the minivan‚Äôs still here if you need to go anywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Master.‚Äù

He reached down and messed up my hair. ‚ÄúChin up, Mirabella. This is the life you‚Äôve always wanted, even if you don‚Äôt know it yet. It‚Äôs the life I‚Äôve always wanted, too. After everything I went through, living through literal hell, I‚Äôve got my wife and daughters back, and a maid to serve us. We‚Äôre living the dream, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, yes, Master,‚Äù I lied.

//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\

My ass felt like it was on fire as I squirmed in the minivan, trying to get comfortable while waiting for the girls to get out of school.

A few hours earlier, the mailman had delivered my maid‚Äôs outfits and what I assumed was the chastity device in a box with a Nevada postmark. I hung the uniforms in my closet, which meant I had to throw out more of what was left of my wardrobe. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do about the chastity cage, so I called Cody‚Äôs cellphone. Since there was no answer, I left a message telling him the package had arrived, and set the box inside my closet before resuming my chores. I thought about changing into one of the uniforms to clean, although since I knew I‚Äôd have to change to pick up the girls, I decided to stay dressed in my usual sweats.

I‚Äôd been in a daze since Cody‚Äôs assault, and as I tidied the house, I felt like a completely different person ‚Äî a literal slave, although one who was morbidly happy about his lowly position. Maybe it was a bit of the Stockholm Syndrome, but I was overwhelmed with what I can only describe as romantic feelings for Cody, something I‚Äôd never before experienced with a man. I saw him as my abuser and my protector, and I found myself craving his approval as much as I craved Liz‚Äôs. The sonofabitch had pissed on me and raped me ‚Äî and deep down in my soul, I knew I‚Äôd loved every second of it.

My submissive euphoria was tempered whenever I‚Äôd contemplate the non-sexual aspects of our new paradigm, and my loss of status at home. At least when Cody humiliated me as he had earlier, there was an erotic element to it. But outside the bedroom, being treated like shit by the family, particularly Mia, didn‚Äôt turn me on ‚Äî it just hurt.

But I reminded myself that this was what my master wanted. And after the incredible bond we‚Äôd forged earlier, with him literally pushing himself into the depths of my soul and claiming it as his, I knew there was nothing I could ever deny him.

I heard the bell ring, and students began filing out of the school. After nearly an hour, Brooke and Mia wandered out of the building with a group of other kids. They said their good-byes and headed my way, oblivious to the fact that they‚Äôd made me cool my heels while they were screwing around with their friends ‚Äî something they‚Äôd always done.

The girls piled in the minivan‚Äôs backseat, and used my most respectful tone when greeting my employers.

‚Äú   Did you have a nice day at school?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as a nice day at school,‚Äù Brooke deadpanned, and I chuckled before putting the minivan in gear.

The girls were lost in their cellphones the entire drive, and didn‚Äôt say another word to me. I was relieved, since I‚Äôd been walking on eggshells whenever Mia was around ‚Äî and then, a wave of shame swept through me as I realized how frightened I was of a 14-year-old girl.

When I pulled onto our street, I saw my Audi in the driveway, meaning Cody was home from running his errands. Just thinking about my master made me shudder.

I followed the girls into the house. Mia shook off her coat and let it slip to the floor as she said over her shoulder, ‚Äúbring me chips, maid.‚Äù

Brooke smiled and handed me her coat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have chips, too, Mirabella, thanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Miss.‚Äù

I curtseyed to the girls, but they didn‚Äôt notice as they made a beeline for their father, who was chilling on the couch. After picking Mia‚Äôs coat up from the floor and hanging up both garments, I scooted to the kitchen and prepared two iced teas and two bowls of potato chips, the girls‚Äô preferred afterschool snack.

Cody smirked while I served his daughters. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs a big day for you, huh, Mirabella? Your uniforms came in.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, good for you,‚Äù Brooke said, trying her best to be supportive.

Mia scoffed. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter what he wears ‚Äî he‚Äôll still look stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, tell Mia to stop being mean to Mirabella all the time.‚Äù Brooke scowled at her sister. ‚ÄúEver since you told her Mirabella works for us, she‚Äôs let the power go to her head.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I haven‚Äôt ‚Äî the maid has to do what we say. Dad said.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be so nasty to him all the time. Tell her, Dad.‚Äù

I felt like a fool standing there while the girls argued over me, although my master was able to quickly take control of the situation.

‚ÄúMia, why are you mean to the maid?‚Äù he asked in a quiet, though authoritarian voice.

My youngest stepdaughter scowled at me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Dad ‚Äî he just gets on my nerves.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why? What does he do?‚Äù

Mia shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt do anything,‚Äù Brooke said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just mean to him all the time.‚Äù

Cody smiled and touched Mia‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúHoney, go easy on the maid, okay? I know this is all new to you, and things might be confusing. And I get that you‚Äôre testing your newfound power over the man who used to be your stepdad, and that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs natural. Just tone it down a little, huh? Your sister doesn‚Äôt like it, and neither does your mom.‚Äù

In a ‚Äúspeak-of-the-devil‚Äù moment, Liz walked through the front door, looking a bit haggard. I hurried to take her coat and purse, which she handed to me without a word before heading straight to her lover, who stood up and greeted her with a long kiss.

‚ÄúGet a room, you two,‚Äù Mia teased after the amorous couple had snogged for several seconds.

Liz broke off her kiss with Cody and sighed. ‚ÄúUgh, I had a long, hard day. Mirabella, hurry up and get dinner on the table.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo change into your uniform first,‚Äù Cody advised.

‚ÄúOh, his uniforms came?‚Äù Liz asked, showing more interest in my crossdressing than she ever had.

Cody answered in the affirmative as I headed toward the stairs, with my heart pounding.

1ivw0xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ivw0xo/looking_for_some_advicehard_truths/,Looking for some advice/hard truths,"\*Apologies, this came out as a longer write up than I intended\* full disclosure, I am not very experienced with relationships 

Essentially, I was pretty blindsided 3.5 months ago by my now ex saying probably what others have heard before - still loves me, but can't show or receive affection right now for reasons she hasn't been able to figure out herself. This change happened almost overnight, a week after she had experienced a (relatively minor) injury, but one that inhibited her active lifestyle. for the week prior, she clearly was mentally affected pretty negatively by this, but wanted my comfort through it - then overnight, a switch flipped and it almost seemed like she became a different person. To me, it seemed like the catalyst was entirely relating to the injury. My ex had a tendency to spiral in her own thoughts and it felt as if this is what was happening here based on prior experiences.

  
I wanted to work through it, however she said she wasn't able to receive or give affection at this point in time, and wasn't sure why that was - but she wasn't in a headspace to be able to work through things. I was the one who said i guess that means we need to break up, despite that being absolutely not what I wanted. 

  
Here's where I'm stuck - i've given it almost 4 months of ({almost) zero contact aside from one slip-up very early on. Unfollowed her social media, it seems she muted mine (she still follows but i noticed she never views any stories, etc) so we both have given the other pretty much total space.

  
I was down pretty bad for a couple months but slowly improved, to a point. However, it feels as if I've plateaued. When I think about her, I still want to see her - partly because I miss my buddy, and want to hear how she is doing, see her face, etc (i know that isn't a healthy reason to meet up). Also - partly because I felt I got zero closure, and I want to hear her thoughts after these 4 months as to what happened, if she thinks it's the right decision, etc. 

  
I realize she could have just been trying to let me down gently, but I do believe her when she said she still loves me and genuinely doesn't know why she's feeling this way. Her tears made me feel it was not a cut-and-dry break for her, and she vocalized during the conversation she doesn't know if this is the right call, but one that was made anyhow.

The lack of closure and uncertainty has made it challenging for me to completely move past this, because I can't help but wonder if taking these 4 months where we both were working on ourselves, was what we needed to figure this shit out. Getting hard proof that yes, this decisions still feels right to her, may benefit me in moving past this even if it would sting in the moment.

  
Any similar experiences? Am I being naive by thinking that meeting up for a coffee after 4 months of no contact isn't a horrible idea? I'm feeling tempted to just reach out and say ""hey, it's been awhile - want to meet up some evening this week and catch up?""",1,1740266491.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôve never used or tried one before. After using it for those 4 days, I‚Äôm hooked. SO much simpler, cleaner, and easier for espresso. That machine used the original pods. So when I got home, I found and ordered the Nespresso Inissia machine. I was unsure what the Vertuo pods were. I also found the machine new and on sale. I paid about $124 all in tax included. So now I now come here for help and advice (which I probably should had done sooner). Did I purchase an ok machine? What pods should I look for with that drink order in mind? Does each pod make only one shot of espresso? The two size buttons, do they correlate with the pods ordered? Like, if I use the larger button on an espresso pod, will it be watered down? And vice versa, if I use the small on a non espresso pod, will I not be getting the full cup? Are there even non espresso pods? I prefer blond espresso in drinks as lighter roasts tend to hold more caffeine. But I‚Äôm not opposed to the occasional hot cappuccino with a good crema.

1ivvrlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ivvrlp/what_hurts_the_most/,What Hurts the Most.,"The office was the same as always‚Äîstale air, the hum of computers, the rhythmic clatter of keyboards. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in a dull, artificial glow that seemed to seep into your bones. A dense fog of coffee and printer toner hung in the air, mingling with the artificial pine of the maintenance staff's morning cleaning routine. I settled into my chair with a quiet sigh as the familiar pain flared up again‚Äîdeep, gnawing, radiating down my left leg like a slow-moving fire.

It had been bad for weeks, but today was unbearable. A deep, pulsing ache that burrowed into my bones, twisting and tightening with every breath. Nothing helped. It was relentless, like some creature had taken residence in my left side and was slowly, methodically, gnawing its way through me.

The morning meeting dragged on in the conference room. Jenkins from Marketing droned about quarterly projections while I tried to focus on anything but the burning sensation that radiated through me. The polyester office chair seemed designed specifically to amplify my discomfort, each slight adjustment sending fresh waves of pain through my body.

""Still bothering you?"" Greg's voice drifted over from the next cubicle after we returned. He was sipping his coffee‚Äîblack, two sugars, the same way he'd taken it for the past seven years‚Äîwith the usual lazy concern in his tone. Steam curled up from his ""World's Okayest Dad"" mug, a gift from his teenage daughter that he treasured despite its ironic intent.

""Yeah,"" I muttered, trying to find a comfortable position. ""Worse today.""

""You should really get that checked out, man.""

I just nodded, even though I knew I wouldn't. What could they do? Nothing ever worked. Not anymore. Besides, I'd had enough of doctors, enough of sympathetic faces and carefully worded explanations.

The morning crawled by. Sharp sensations shot through my left side with each breath, each small movement becoming an exercise in endurance. The numbers on my screen blurred together, my fingers hesitated over the keyboard, my mind drowned in the slow, unbearable throb that pulsed through me. The quarterly report I was supposed to be reviewing might as well have been written in Sanskrit.

Email notifications kept piling up. Each little ping felt like a personal attack, another demand I couldn't meet, another reminder of how much this pain was taking from me. The cursor blinked accusingly on my half-finished response to Corporate.

By lunch, I could feel the pity radiating from my coworkers. The way they glanced at me when they thought I wasn't looking, their voices softening when they spoke to me, as if volume itself might shatter me. Lisa from accounting‚Äîwho hadn't said more than ""good morning"" to me in three years‚Äîsuddenly appeared at my desk, offering to grab something from the vending machine. The concern in her eyes made me want to scream.

The break room was worse. Everyone huddled around their usual tables, conversations dropping to whispers as I microwaved my sad frozen dinner. I caught fragments: ""...hasn't been the same since..."" and ""...should take medical leave..."" The microwave hummed, masking their words but not their intentions.

The afternoon stretched endlessly. Meetings blurred together, a parade of PowerPoints and action items that barely registered. My calendar reminder for the 2 PM client call felt like a death sentence. I sat through it, camera off, muted except when absolutely necessary, letting the client's complaints about the latest software update wash over me like static.

Just Checking In

---


Sarah from HR stopped by my desk at 4:30, her forced cheerfulness more exhausting than the pain itself.

""Just checking in,"" she chirped, perching on the edge of my desk like we were old friends. ""You know, we have great resources for wellness here. And the employee assistance‚Äî""

""I'm fine,"" I cut her off, perhaps too sharply. ""Just a bad day.""

She retreated, leaving behind a pamphlet about workplace wellness that I immediately buried under a stack of papers.

The Silence at Home

---


The apartment was quiet when I got in, the only sound the low hum of the fridge and the distant wail of a siren somewhere in the city. I let out a long breath, sinking into the couch, pressing my fingers against my side in a useless attempt to knead the pain away. It was deep now, an unbearable weight pressing into my bones. The throbbing had become an agonizing pulse that seemed to echo through my entire body.

The silence felt oppressive. I flicked on the TV, letting some mindless reality show fill the space. Contestants argued over something trivial while judges made exaggerated faces of shock. The normal world, carrying on as if nothing had changed.

I needed sleep.

My dinner sat untouched on the coffee table‚Äîsome microwave meal I'd grabbed from the freezer without really looking at the label. The thought of eating made my stomach turn. Instead, I peeled off my work clothes, every movement stiff and slow, and lowered myself into bed. The sheets were cold against my skin. I shifted, trying to find a position that didn't make it worse.

From my bedroom window, I could see into the apartment across the street. A family eating dinner, laughing about something. A normal evening in a normal life. The kind of life I used to have, before...

I lay there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for relief. The pain twisted deeper, a searing pressure that made my breath catch. Minutes stretched into hours as I drifted in and out of consciousness, the agony following me even into my dreams.

Finally, exhaustion won.

Waking Up to Reality

Sunlight filtered through the blinds when I opened my eyes. For a moment, the pain was distant, dulled by sleep. I pushed myself up, still groggy, ready to start another day.

Then I tried to stand.

The world tilted violently. My hands grasped at empty air as I crashed to the floor, shoulder slamming against the cold hardwood.

He sometimes gets into moods where he just wants quiet and space, but also sometimes is lonely and wants  me to just lay by him silently

Today  he is in this mood an dhas been since thursday I laid for a bit got up to get coffee with my sister brought him a coffee and food he wanted me to lay i did but he got huffy because i was too cold. So i went and did chores around 1 pm i brought him another coffee and he didn't want me to stay so I didn't, at 3 I decided to go back out so I went to tell him he wanted me to lay down so I did but he thought it was too much so I left. I got home at 5 and went upstairs ( he's still in bed playing video games ) so I just said hungry? And he nodded so I said what do you want I'll cook ! and he snapped saying  i want fucking  silence.
I took a deep breath and said how would you feel is i laid in bed all day you offered to make and bring me food and I snapped that I wanted silence?

He says i would feel like you were hungry for fucking silence!

So I just went back downstairs I'm going to go out I'm not sure I'm coming back today even  though we haven't spent a night about in 14 years. I'm just so mad, he talks about how sensitive I am he is such an emotional mess I have to walk on egg shells  this is why I can't be direct! ... that said this is no where near the worst thing he has ever said to me so I don't know why I'm so upset.

>!\- Essence tends to pile up when there‚Äôs nothing left to upgrade. Maybe there could be a way to convert excess essence into materials when visiting a person or a certain location.!<

**Magic spells**:

>!\- The magic system feels well-paced (stamina management early on, rain spells as we earn money for crops, etc.). I‚Äôm excited to see more spells.!<

**Day Cycle**:

>!\- Stamina and health aren‚Äôt punished too harshly, so I enjoy taking advantage of that extra hour at the cost of four hours (probably not the most efficient, but it's fun!).!<

>!\- A sound alarm for 12 AM, similar to the one for 8 PM, would be super helpful. I tend to ignore pop-up notifications when I‚Äôm focused, but I always notice the 8 PM sound.!<

**Inventory**:

>!\- Love the 30-slot inventory!!<

>!\- While I understand the alphabetic order of items, it feels odd. It would be great to have an option to organize items by category (e.g., forageables, crops, ranching, etc.).!<

**Maps**:

>!\- The map is functional, and I love being able to see characters‚Äô locations. It‚Äôs simple and easy to use, but I‚Äôd welcome a more detailed version in the future.!<

>!\- It would be nice if hovering over a character‚Äôs icon showed their name. I‚Äôve mixed up Reina with Josephine, Merri with Celine, and Hemlock with Landen and Olric (among others). Also, Maple‚Äôs pixel icon could be more distinguishable‚Äîher brown hair blends into the gray/white areas.!<

**Shipping**:

>!\- The shipping system works well. I like that we can move and add more bins.!<

>!\- A tesserae count before shipping would be an awesome QoL improvement. It‚Äôd also be great if we could sell items instantly at a store or other location rather than waiting for the next day.!<

**Ranching & animals**:

>!\- I‚Äôm glad the auto-pet mechanic is coming! The skill upgrades are great too, especially the one for newborns.!<

>!\- In my experience, I started ranching quite late‚Äîaround late summer, I believe‚Äîand I didn‚Äôt find much incentive to focus on it beyond the food story quest involving cheese and eggs. I haven‚Äôt received many quests related to ranching in the early game either. While I understand that it can be a great money maker with minimal effort after investing in hearts, I personally find farming more satisfying. Ranching feels a bit repetitive, especially having to pet all the animals and replenish hay, only for it to be eaten by every pet if the barn is full. It just doesn‚Äôt feel as engaging to me compared to the mines, where I enjoy the challenge of figuring out how to defeat monsters, almost like solving a puzzle.!<

**Farmhouse**:

>!\- Cute house with a good amount of space! Excited for more upgrades!!<

>!\- Please add a notebook or to-do list, either integrated into the diary or as a new item in the inventory. I‚Äôd love to have something I can check and edit on the go.!<

**Events**:

>!\- I love the events so far! I‚Äôm always excited for more. Fields of Mistria is one of the few games where I read through all the dialogue instead of skipping it.!<

>!\- I‚Äôd love to see more events like the Spring Festival, where we gather flowers. Maybe incorporating a minigame element would be fun, though I really enjoyed the Shooting Star Festival as well‚Äîit was adorable! While it‚Äôs not necessary, I think it would be amazing if there were a photo album feature. For example, after a cutscene, we could get a fully pixelated frame featuring the characters and the background from our point of view. I know it might be difficult to include us in the shots, but even without us, I think it would be a nice touch! This game reminds me of those romance-story games I used to play, and that kind of feature would really add to the charm. Also, I find it interesting that characters‚Äô birthdays aren‚Äôt a bigger deal in the community and are mainly just for the player (I understand why, of course). It would be nice if we could trigger a party at the inn to celebrate with everyone! I placed my birthday on Spring 2, just like my real birthday, but I was a bit disappointed when neither Eiland nor Adeline celebrated with me, especially since they‚Äôre so welcoming and accommodating. (I guess I was a little spoiled, haha!)!<

**Characters**:

>!\- I love all the characters and their designs. The way they interact and their cute animations are a huge highlight.!<

>!\- Olric definitely needs to be a romanceable character‚Äîplease, please, please! I was heartbroken (I'm sorry for being dramatic) when I first met him and saw he didn‚Äôt have a heart. I had to settle for Juniper and March (though I‚Äôm very excited for Caldarus‚Äô release). It would be cool to meet Adeline and Eiland‚Äôs parents or even visit the capital someday. I‚Äôd also love to see more flaws or drama among the characters, as it adds depth to their personalities. While the characters are all friendly, accommodating, and helpful‚Äîwhich is lovely‚Äîit can start to feel a bit repetitive. For example, it feels a bit odd that Juniper can easily manipulate the villagers with her magic (though watching Olric turn into a bunny was hilarious). What I‚Äôm hoping for are storylines that explore deeper conflicts or differing perspectives. A good comparison would be Bokura, where you have to choose between two sides‚Äîeach with valid points, but ultimately you need to pick a stance. It could even lead to a compromise between the two sides. Think Life is Strange with its balance of empathy vs rebellion (Max vs Chloe) or Ghost of Tsushima with honor vs abandoning tradition. There are so many games that explore these kinds of moral dilemmas, and I‚Äôd love to see something similar in Fields of Mistria.!<

**Monsters**:

>!\- The monster designs are fantastic, and I love the challenge of figuring out how to defeat them. Keep it up!!<

**Museum**:

>!\- I love being able to see all the items needed to complete the museum, and the checkbox feature for submissions is very helpful.!<

**Areas**:

>!\- Locations like the general store, bathhouse, inn, and blacksmith are great.!<

>!\- The clinic, fish shop, and summit feel a bit lacking. I never really buy anything at the clinic, and I‚Äôve only gone there once to see what happens if I die. The fish shop is mainly for recipes and the first fishing rod, and I rarely visit the summit except for the stamina well.!<

**Fish**:

>!\- The fishing is okay, very simple.!<

>!\- An indicator feature of fish that are missing for the museum or providing hints on which fish we can catch when we are fishing would be incredibly helpful. I really don‚Äôt want to keep pulling up the wiki to see which fish are associated with which sizes. It‚Äôd also be great if the descriptions of fish indicated whether they‚Äôre cookable or not, some aren't indicated for some reason, leading me to end up hoarding fish because of this. I‚Äôd love to see more fishing mechanics and faster leveling up of the fishing skill (I did not unlock level 30 i think... so I'm sorry if I am ignorant).!<

**Cooking**:

>!\- The infusion mechanic is really cool!!<

>!\- It would be awesome to have hints on where or how to obtain locked recipes. Also, being able to cook or make items like soy sauce, honey, or salted rocks would be a great addition.!<

**Quality of life wants and needs**:

>!\- Please make objects behind other objects semi-transparent (similar to Stardew Valley) to help with farm design.!<

>!\- Multiplayer! I‚Äôd love to play this with my boyfriend, even if it means adjusting the essence requirements to unlock skills for balance purposes.!<

>!\- The furniture placement system could be improved. It‚Äôs often frustrating to center furniture, and it would be fun to interact with chairs and coffee!!<

>!\- More heart events for non-romanceable characters would be fantastic. Even if they don‚Äôt lead to romance, it would be great to unlock deeper friendships or lore.!<

>!\- A way to move chests with items inside would be super helpful! Whether it‚Äôs an item or a skill, anything that makes this possible would be amazing.!<

>!\- Add a display system for items in signs (similar to Stardew Valley). It would be great to see the actual items instead of just colored chests.!<

>!\- More weapon types, like bows or magic wands.!<

>!\- More unexpected or dramatic character expressions, like Celine‚Äôs cute blush or Juniper‚Äôs OH HO HO HO, would add more personality!!<

>!\- Please make gathering wood and stone faster through upgrades or skills. Especially wood‚Äîgetting only five pieces per tree is tedious compared to the faster-paced mining (due to passively getting it through killing monsters and skills).!<

>!\- Fast travel options (perhaps through hidden cave passageways) would be greatly appreciated!!<

>!\- Please make Essence pop up much faster! There were so many times I‚Äôd break a tree and then have to wait for the Essence to appear. It gets a little annoying, and often, I just end up running away before it shows up.!<

>!**For Fields of Mistria Team**: I truly wish you all the best success moving forward. Please remember to take proper breaks and pace yourselves, as your well-being is the most important.!<",10,1740265466.0,FieldsOfMistriaGame,0,1.0,False

My tolerance is a little higher, at least at this moment in my life (college is rough). I usually can't tell a big difference unless I've had a second cup of coffee that day. I can feel my thoughts become a little bit more coherent, but not by much. My tics are usually good, but sometimes it's just the perfect mix of environment+mood+caffeine that will send me into a tic attack. It's just funny because you'd think it'd either be one or the other.
