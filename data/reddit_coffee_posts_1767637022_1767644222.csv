1q4wof0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1q4wof0/6_things_that_secretly_give_you_anxiety_but_no/,6 Things That Secretly Give You Anxiety (But No One Talks About Them),"Almost everyone deals with anxiety, but not everyone knows \*why\* it shows up when it does. It’s easy to blame it on stress, trauma, or burnout, but the truth is, a lot of low-key habits and modern-day lifestyle choices are quietly feeding our anxiety daily without us realizing it.

This post isn’t about preaching. It’s meant to unpack some sneaky anxiety triggers backed by legit research, stuff you won’t catch from a 12-second TikTok by some influencer with zero actual knowledge. All the insights here are pulled from verified sources like \*The Huberman Lab Podcast\*, \*The Journal of Anxiety Disorders\*, and behavioral science research from Harvard and Stanford.

If you’ve been feeling anxious but can’t figure out why, here are 6 overlooked triggers that might be messing with you—and what to do instead.

**Caffeine… especially on an empty stomach**

Andrew Huberman (neurobiologist at Stanford)\* breaks this down beautifully. In one of his episodes, he explains how caffeine reduces adenosine (the chemical that makes you feel sleepy), which is great for alertness—but also triggers your body’s stress response.

Drinking coffee first thing without food? That’s like pouring gasoline on a nervous system already dealing with cortisol spikes from waking up.

In a 2022 study from \*Nutrients Journal\*, researchers found that high caffeine intake significantly increases anxiety symptoms, especially in sensitive individuals.

Fix:\* Try drinking it 90 minutes after waking and eat something first. Even a banana helps slow the cortisol peak.

**Not enough morning sunlight**

Light is medicine for your brain. A lack of sunlight disrupts your circadian rhythm and messes with your dopamine and serotonin—two essential chemicals for regulating mood and stress.

A 2020 paper in \*Frontiers in Psychology\* noted that people who get less than 30 minutes of morning light had significantly higher anxiety scores.

Morning light tells your brain it’s time to wake up, which sets the tone for cortisol balance for the entire day.

Fix:\* Get outside within 30 minutes of waking up. You don’t need direct sun—just daylight on your skin and eyes for 10 minutes helps a ton.

**Too much scrolling, not enough social**

There’s a difference between passive consumption (doomscrolling) and active connection (FaceTiming a close friend).

The \*American Journal of Preventive Medicine\* found in their study of 1,787 adults that individuals with high social media use were 2.7 times more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression.

**The problem isn’t the phone; it’s how we use it**

\* \*Fix:\* Limit passive apps (like IG and TikTok) to 30 minutes a day. Use that time to call a friend or do something IRL with someone. Quality over quantity.

**Always needing a Plan B**

Sounds smart in theory, right? But living in constant backup-mode trains your brain to expect failure before anything even goes wrong.

Harvard psychologist Dr. Daniel Gilbert has studied how ""impact bias"" makes us overestimate how bad things will feel if they go wrong—so we pre-plan our disappointment and unknowingly keep ourselves in a low-level threat state.

Fix:\* Make the plan. Commit. Don’t always prep for disaster. Training yourself to sit with uncertainty builds actual resilience.

**Perfectionism disguised as productivity**

People love to wear “I’m a perfectionist” like a badge, but psychological research shows that perfectionism is highly correlated with chronic anxiety.

According to a meta-analysis in \*the Journal of Clinical Psychology\*, perfectionistic tendencies, especially the fear of making mistakes, drive heightened anxiety responses, procrastination, and burnout.

Fix:\* Try the 90% rule from Greg McKeown’s \*Effortless\*: if something feels 90% good enough, ship it. Let “done” be better than “perfect.”

**Low blood sugar crashes (aka ‘hangxiety’) are real**

Skipping meals or eating only sugar/carbs causes blood glucose levels to spike fast, then crash; that crash often feels \*exactly\* like anxiety: shakiness, irritability, and racing thoughts.

A 2021 review in \*Harvard Health\* linked blood sugar instability with increased anxiety and panic symptoms.

Fix: Balance your plate. Add protein to every meal. Don’t go more than 4–5 hours without food. Think eggs, Greek yogurt, nuts, tofu, or protein shakes.

These things may seem small, but they add up. Anxiety isn’t always about what’s happening around you—it’s often what’s happening \*inside\* your nervous system. The good news? These are all learnable adjustments, not personality flaws.

How do you do the whole dating side of things? 

  
I'm a mum (32) of 4 lil ones... yep, that probably sounds terrifying in itself to any man.

  
But I was seeing someone a while back, we'd always meet for coffee ect and things were going really well. 

I ended up going a bit quieter for just over a week due to health and kids ect. I messaged the guy apologising for my ignorance. He took it well. Was a bit upset I didn't message him at all, which I understand that... but at the same time, he didn't message either. 

  
And it's happened again. I had a family member pass away, he gave me some time to grieve. We were talking again after that, and then he went quiet. I've messaged him, he'd reply, but not with anything that could make the conversation continue. 

  
The last time I spoke to him was on christmas, wishing him a merry Christmas. He replied, but apart from that he hasn't even text. 

  
We went from texting every day to not texting at all. 

  
I have explained I'll be slow at replying, due to looking after my children, cleaning ect, but other than that, I'll reply. He was upset when I didn't message before, but he hasn't even bother either. So I don't get it. 

  
I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't do dating, as I was in a 10yr relationship before, and it's all new to me. So I'm pretty rubbish at it all.

30M,firstborn, divorced 2 years ago, abused as a kid, 6 years after escaped from cult (famous one in my home country), currently trying on myself for removing all the doctrines that been put since i was 10 years old, doing odd jobs for maintaining my cafe racer(oil change, work commute, and i illegally didn't have license to ride)  .

my parents still are indoctrinated from those cult brainwash and they try to force me to think as they are, family gatherings are weird and me full of silence and they think me as a failure and easily manipulated. They arrange a marriage that i in limbo of accepting (my ex-wife also lived in the same cult) and after couple of years of living together. Ex-Father in law sees me as an irresponsible guy who smokes (i smoke because I'm depressed) and they force me to divorce my ex-wife. While me in marriage, I tried to increase income by doing odd jobs (busking, delivery rider, music teacher) yet still they think i am that irresponsible guy and they successfully inciting my ex-wife to ran away from me and isolate me. I had to take the decision of divorcing my wife as a way for me to be safe from those manipulating father in law.

  
after the divorce, i became a guy that easily manipulated, always crying alone, riding my bike to nowhere and almost kill myself from zoning out on bike, and now i have dislocated my shoulder as a reminder of myself not to zone out on bike and it hurt when i went to sleep.

i sleep a lot and keep missing on appointments for work, my boss always scolds me as a guy who shouldn't live in this face of earth, less eating, more coffee and cigarette and doom scrolling around my laptop and my phone while my bank account is decreasing rapidly.

my friend asks me to go to a volunteer therapy, and they diagnosed me as ADHD. Only my father acknowledges me as ADHD guy but my mom kept denying. i didn't take any medications because they think all chemical related things to do with medicine is evil and destroying your brain (which I still believe). I couldn't take any CBD related medicine because my country law declared it as illegal.

my work is temporary, i almost tried to kill myself but failed miserably because of my fear in next life. But i had 3 attempts to suicide.

finding help in my country is expensive and everyone thinks that you are a maniac and crazy guy if you get help from psychiatrist or mental health related things.

i get all of the dream of being abused during my childhood (the residue of the abuse permanently stays from the scars, loped right ears from pulling from my abused childhood days and burnt scar on my feet, weird shape on my head because woman in the cult throws on me a wood chair) and waking up felt i wanted to die occasionally and sleeping for many hours and waking up  i felt very drained of energy and exhausted.

am i worthy of living? or just better do nothing until i die from any possible causes? or dying is better for my family because they think i am a burden to family, my siblings, and my society? or move away from my home country and die out of my home country is better because i am not a burden anymore to them?

She would get overwhelmed and then just shut down, and want to figure out/argue about something right then and there. I would always try to at least move her out of the aisle to somewhere a bit more out of the way, but she would just stay put and not move until we finished our argument. And God forbid I said something along the lines of ""it's not that big of a deal"", her response would be ""oh so you think I'm making this a big deal huh??""

Airbnb is no longer a “side hustle”; it’s a takeover. Every second house or apartment seems to come with a complimentary key lockbox and a “perfect for short-term letting” description. And before anyone says, “But they’re building new apartments,” please do have a look at the listings — even the developers are marketing them as ideal Airbnbs. That tells you everything.
Long-term renting is already wildly unaffordable, and this isn’t helping. At some point, there has to be regulation around how many Airbnbs exist and where they’re allowed. A city can’t survive on weekend visitors alone.

We met when I had moved temporarily to his city and ultimately I ended up staying there for him (I like the city but the main reason was him). We’ve had a great couple of years and I love him to the bottom of my heart but there’s two issues that have I was aware for a while, but I feel like they are getting ready to explode and I don’t want them to.

1) He has anxiety which can make him stressed and sad sometimes. The anxiety mainly comes with world politics, potential wars, Russian nukes etc. I remember the worst thing he ever said to me was what was the point in continuing Uni as the world was going to end anyway. Other small things like making difficult decisions can stress him out (and he’ll get a bit mad at me during it). We’ve talked a good few times about his anxiety and stress and usually it’s agreed he’ll speak to someone and look into resources but it never happens unfortunately. This is usually a rinse and repeat every 2/3 months when his anxiety gets bad again. He pretty much refuses to go and see a doctor about it incase it gets put on his “permanent record” and he is stuck medication for life, can’t drink alcohol or coffee, can’t do certain jobs or has to pay more for travel insurance. He thinks most other resources are a waste of time and don’t work. He thinks councillors either won’t work and he’ll be forced to pay £50 a week to one for the rest of his life.

2) We’re both gay of course, but he isn’t out to his brother (25) or his dad even though we’ve been going out over 2.5 years. He told his mum about 6 months after we met and to be fair, she didn’t appear to take it great at first but from what I understand she is okay now and asks about me often enough (has gotten me a Christmas present too). I’ve only met her twice but I’ve recently learned she’s been asking me around for dinner but my boyfriend has been putting it off. 

Based on the reaction from his Mum, I wasn’t surprised he put off telling his dad but that was two years ago. My BF was taking a gap year at the time and then went to do a Master’s last year so the logic at the time was that he was waiting until he was working full time in case he got kicked out. He’s been working now since September and while I wouldn’t expect such a quick turnaround, again I’ve recently learned that he has no real plans to do so and isn’t sure what the catalyst will be. I’m really unsure why he hasn’t told his brother who I assume will be perfectly okay with it given his age, with one reason I’ve been told “something will just be different” between them. Note that his brother lives 3 hours away and they see each other about once a month. Overall my BF says once he gets his anxiety under control then it’ll be okay to tell them but as above I don’t know when that will happen.

I really really do love him but at this point I don’t know what help I can give him and the whole not being out thing is starting to eat away at me. I feel like whenever I try to help him with his anxiety I’m not able to (“but this.. but this..”). We had plans to move in together mid this year but to be honest that timeline seems unrealistic given the current pace. On a personal level, I would like to move flats and not have a flat mate so ideally don’t want to be wasting another year in a flat I don’t particularly like. 

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

1q4wd0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1q4wd0k/my_wife_is_permanently_stuck_in_mom_mode_and_its/,My wife is permanently stuck in mom mode and it's affecting our marriage. I don't even know how to begin to approach this.,"Before I even type this, I already get the sense that people are going to jump all over me and call me a piece of shit but I really hope that that doesn't happen in that my best of intentions comes through louder than anything else here.

We have an 18-month-old boy and we both adore him, my wife especially so. All she wants to dote on him and love him and talk about him and how wonderful he is. That all sounds great, so what's the problem?

I love that my wife adores our child. He's every bit as precious to me as he is to her. However, I'm getting the sense that she is giving 110% of herself to him and I'm getting nothing from her and I don't mean just sex, but rather emotionally and mentally. Let me give you some examples.

Every night when we all get home, we play with him, dance with him, tickle him, and just generally love on him. However, my wife who is not in bad shape, completely exhausts herself and she's ready for bed by 8:30. I'm lucky if we get 20 minutes together to eat and talk before she's dragging herself to bed because she just spent the last 3 hours doing cardio with him essentially. I'm usually left up by myself to wash all the dishes, sweep, mop, and do laundry. Again, I love that we play with him but I try to conserve some energy so that I can do what I need to do at the end of the night. 

Over the holiday break, we both had the day off when our son's daycare was open so I suggested we go out and get brunch and then go to a bookstore and then get some coffee. She excitedly agreed but then whenever I tried to talk to her, the conversation lasted only a minute or two before she would either cut me off or let me finish and then reply with something like "" I love (our son) so much. I love him I love him I love him"" and then she would start to look down at her phone and watch videos and pictures of him. She did this at both brunch and coffee and then at the bookstore she spent the entire time in the kids section looking for books for him. I asked if she wanted to check out a new series that we had been wanting to read together that they had displayed on the other side of the store and she said no. 

We haven't had sex in almost 5 months. I gave up trying to initiate because she turned me down probably eight times in a row over the course of a month and a half. When we do have sex, it's very by the numbers and my wife doesn't want to do hardly anything that she used to love. Example, she won't let me go down on her ever because she isn't shaved. I asked her why she doesn't just shave then and she said that because she's a mom now and she feels weird not being shaved. I bring this up because she used to absolutely love when I would do that for her. She wanted me to do this for her sometimes 4 or 5 nights in a row. I'm only saying this to give some context as to the complete 180 when it comes to this topic.

There are other things as well that I won't get into but every time I ask why she doesn't like doing XY and Z anymore the answer is always because "" I'm a mom now and that's weird for me to do"". My first thought was that maybe she's self-conscious that's because of the way her body changed and I gently asked her if that was a factor and she emphatically said no.

I already have an idea of what readers are thinking at this point so I will address some of them preemptively. 

She does not have postpartum depression.

We do take care of domestic duties nearly split right down the middle. If anything, I actually do more around the house than she does but not holding that against her. Just a fact.

I've tried romancing her and trying to reconnect various ways but our little one always seems to pop up as a distraction, whether he's physically there or not.

I haven't tried to talk to her about this yet because how do you even begin to ask the mother of your child to be less obsessed with her baby?

Closing thoughts: again, I really hope that my best intentions that I'm trying to convey are coming through. I'm not wanting her to love our son any less. I'm just trying to ask her to love me a little bit more.

1q4wc91,https://i.redd.it/o9dk8w657lbg1.jpeg,‎‏USMLE Step 1 Experience (Pass) img,"This is a long post, but if you feel lost or you’re just starting, try to read it till the end — it might help you.

Alhamdulillah, I passed USMLE Step 1, and this is my experience.

⸻

The Beginning

I started studying for Step 1 out of curiosity. I wasn’t fully adapted to medical school, and my basics were weak. I found the idea interesting and useful, but I didn’t have a clear plan, strong motivation, or solid reasons to keep going.

Later, I realized this is the most important point of the whole journey.

Your reason for preparing for Step 1 is what will carry you through. It’s the real fuel, because Step 1 preparation is long, exhausting, and difficult — but at the same time, anyone can do it.

One of the most important things I learned was to turn any negative situation in my life into motivation to study more and continue. That mindset is what allowed me to keep going for more than one year and nine months of preparation.

⸻

Starting Preparation

I first joined Dr. Shebl’s course during my 3rd year (2022). The course was helpful, but my studying alongside medical school was not consistent or serious.

When Step 1 became pass/fail, I wanted something shorter and faster, so I moved to Boards & Beyond. Unfortunately, at that time my preparation was mostly just reading First Aid and watching videos without solving questions.

That was a big mistake.

Anything before you start solving questions doesn’t really count.

Your real preparation starts when you begin UWorld.

Another important point: before starting Step 1, try to have a mentor or someone ahead of you. If not, read many experiences on Reddit, Telegram, or groups like EAMTAR, and take what fits you.

⸻

First Read

I started my first read in March / April 2025.

Main sources: First Aid – UWorld

Explanations: Boards & Beyond – Bootcamp

	•	Pathoma: First 3 chapters (read from First Aid)

	•	Anki: I was a bit random with it, but AnKing with UWorld tags is the best use and helps a lot in retaining information

	•	Dirty Medicine: Biochemistry and ethics, plus system-specific videos

	•	Sketchy + Anki: Best for microbiology

	•	Ta7 Pharma: Old and new playlists were excellent

	•	Randy Neil: Biostatistics

	•	ChatGPT: Used as a personal tutor to focus only on high-yield Step 1 material

⸻

Study Method

I finished system videos quickly since I had seen them before, then read First Aid and solved UWorld. I was solving offline and leaving 1–2 blocks per system, which caused problems later. Solving online from the beginning is much better.

During this phase, I had 5th-year exams, so I divided my time, and sometimes relied on Anki to avoid stopping completely. After exams, I took two days off, finished the remaining systems, and reviewed for about 10 days. Forgetting a lot at this stage is completely normal.

⸻

First NBME

At the end of 2025, I took NBME 22 and scored 46%.

It’s a bad score, but for your first NBME, the number doesn’t matter.

What matters is knowing where you stand and identifying your weakest systems.

⸻

Second Read

I was advised to solve UWorld again. Since I had already completed around 80% offline, I subscribed to USMLEPrep. I reread First Aid and solved systems again.

This phase comes with confusion, low confidence, and feeling like you remember nothing — all of this is completely normal. I started with systems, then moved to random blocks. My UWorld scores were initially in the 40s, then gradually improved to the 70s. Usually, scoring 60–70% in UWorld correlates with NBME scores in the 60s.

⸻

Loneliness & Motivation

Most of the time, you will be alone during this journey, and that was true for me. I tried not to feel isolated. I created a Twitter account and followed doctors during match season, watched people succeed, and read experiences on Reddit and Telegram.

During this period, I also watched a lot of motivational videos. It may sound silly, but it helped. I needed anything that pushed me to sit down and study even when I wasn’t in the mood.

Through this, I joined study groups with people preparing like me, which helped especially during the NBME phase. I also studied online with camera on using Study Stream and Discord.

⸻

UWorld Strategy

I used to read the last line first, glance at the answer choices, then read the full question. Always read the full explanations — why your answer was wrong and why the other options were incorrect.

⸻

NBME Phase

This is the most important phase of preparation:

	•	Solve timed

	•	Identify weak systems after each NBME

	•	Categorize mistakes:

	•	Knowledge gap

	•	Anxiety or tricky question

	•	Poor reading or changing answers

Review NBME 26 and above at least twice.

⸻

Scores

NBME 21: 69.5

NBME 23: 64.5

NBME 24: 68

NBME 25: 68

NBME 26: 70

NBME 27: 76

I then entered a plateau, but my level was improving as the exam difficulty increased.

NBME 28: 68.5 → booked eligibility (Nov–Jan)

NBME 29: 69

NBME 30: 69

NBME 31: 68 → booked exam date

NBME 32: 69 (used propranolol 10 mg, also in NBME 33, which helped reduce anxiety and probably prevented score drops)

NBME 33: 74

Free 120: 67

You don’t need very high scores. Higher scores help confidence, but if you’re above 68 in three exams, take the exam.

The goal is PASS.

⸻

Exam Day – 16/12

I traveled to Cairo the day before. Slept early but woke up anxious. I woke up at 6:30, ate two sandwiches, drank coffee, took two 10 mg propranolol tablets, and arrived early.

The exam was very similar to NBMEs. Most blocks finished on time or even a bit earlier. It felt like a mix of NBME style, UWorld, and Free 120. Sometimes you feel you studied something and the exam asks it differently, but if your scores are good and you did your part, don’t panic.

My mentor always told me:

“The next block is the reason you will pass.”

⸻

Post-Exam

I left the exam not knowing how I did. I remembered correct and incorrect questions and felt like I messed up. I tried to distract myself during the waiting period, but it was mentally exhausting for two weeks.

⸻

Final Thoughts

I started with weak basics, and that didn’t stop me.

Your GPA does not define your future. You may take longer, but you will get there.

Consistency is the key. Trust the process and the scores.

Whether you pass or fail, you gain a lot from preparing for Step 1.

1q4wbwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q4wbwr/i_deleted_all_distractions_for_60_days_and_my/,I deleted all distractions for 60 days and my brain completely rewired,"

I was addicted to constant input. Phone while eating, YouTube while working out, podcast while driving, TV while cooking. I hadn’t experienced actual silence in probably 3 years.

The second I felt bored or uncomfortable, my hand would automatically reach for my phone. Waiting in line, sitting on the couch, lying in bed, even at red lights. I was terrified of being alone with my thoughts.

I didn’t even realize how bad it was until I tried to read a book one night and couldn’t focus for more than 30 seconds. My brain would wander, I’d feel anxious, and I’d grab my phone to check something. Anything. Just to feel that hit of stimulation.

That’s when I realized my attention span was completely destroyed. My brain had been rewired to need constant novelty and I couldn’t function without it.

So I made a decision: 60 days of zero unnecessary distractions. No phone during meals, no podcasts during drives, no TV as background noise, no scrolling when bored. Just me and whatever was actually happening in front of me.

What I actually did:

**Mornings in complete silence.** Coffee, breakfast, getting ready, all without checking my phone or turning on any media. Just sitting there existing. Brutal at first.

**Drives without podcasts or music.** Just driving and thinking. Or not thinking. Just being present with the road and my thoughts. Felt weird as hell for the first two weeks.

**Meals as actual meals.** No phone, no TV, no reading. Just eating and experiencing food. When I ate with other people, just conversation. When alone, just me and my thoughts.

**Workouts without content.** No YouTube videos, no music, no podcasts. Just me lifting weights or running in silence. My gym probably thought I was insane.

**Bathroom breaks stayed bathroom breaks.** No more scrolling on the toilet for 20 minutes. Just doing what I came to do and leaving. Cut my bathroom time in half honestly.

**Waiting became waiting.** In line, at appointments, between tasks, I just waited. Didn’t pull out my phone. Didn’t look for something to consume. Just existed in the moment.

**Blocked everything during work hours.** Used this app called Reload to block all social media, YouTube, news sites, everything from 9am to 6pm. When distractions literally won’t open, you’re forced to sit with boredom.

## Days 1-7: Withdrawal was real

The first week I felt like I was losing my mind. My brain was so used to constant stimulation that silence felt physically uncomfortable. I was anxious, irritable, couldn’t sit still.

I’d reach for my phone dozens of times throughout the day and remember it was blocked or I’d made a rule not to use it. That moment of denial felt awful every single time.

Day 4 I almost quit. I was sitting at a red light with nothing to do and I felt this overwhelming urge to check my phone. My hand moved toward it automatically. I had to physically sit on my hand to stop myself. That’s when I realized how addicted I actually was.

## Days 8-14: My brain started adapting

Week two something shifted. During a silent drive I started actually thinking about things. Not just surface level thoughts, but deep reflection about my life, my relationships, decisions I needed to make.

I remembered conversations I’d had years ago. Random memories from childhood would pop up. Ideas for projects I’d been wanting to start. My brain was finally accessing information it had been too cluttered to reach.

During a silent meal I actually tasted my food for the first time in forever. I noticed textures, flavors, temperature. Eating became an actual experience instead of just something I did while scrolling.

## Days 15-30: Boredom became productive

By week three I started having ideas. Real ideas, not just thoughts. Solutions to problems I’d been stuck on at work. Concepts for side projects. Clarity about relationships and friendships.

I realized all these ideas had probably been trying to surface for months but my brain never had the space to process them because I was constantly feeding it input.

I solved a work problem during a silent drive that I’d been struggling with for weeks. Just randomly, the solution appeared fully formed. That never would have happened if I’d been listening to a podcast.

During workouts without music I started pushing harder because I was actually present with my body instead of distracted by content. I was more aware of form, fatigue, progress.

## Days 31-45: I started craving silence

This was the weirdest shift. I actually started looking forward to my silent morning coffee. To drives without podcasts. To meals without my phone. The boredom I’d been terrified of became peaceful.

I’d finish work and instead of immediately turning on TV or scrolling, I’d just sit on my couch for 10 minutes doing nothing. And it felt good. Restorative. Like my brain was finally getting the rest it needed.

My sleep improved dramatically. When you’re not constantly stimulating your brain, it actually knows how to shut down at night. I was falling asleep faster and sleeping deeper.

## Days 46-60: Everything felt clearer

The last two weeks I felt like a completely different person. My attention span came back. I could read for an hour without getting distracted. I could work on tasks for 2-3 hours straight without needing a dopamine hit.

Conversations became deeper because I was actually present. I wasn’t thinking about what to check on my phone or what video I wanted to watch later. I was just there, listening, engaging.

I started noticing things I’d been missing for years. Birds outside my window. The way light hits my apartment in the afternoon. Details in people’s faces when they talk. I’d been so distracted I’d stopped actually seeing the world around me.

## What actually changed after 60 days:

**My brain works again.** I can focus on difficult tasks for hours. I can read books and retain information. I can think deeply about complex problems. My attention span fully recovered.

**I have real ideas now.** Creative thoughts, solutions, insights, all coming naturally because my brain has space to process. I started two side projects from ideas that came during silent moments.

**I’m present with people.** My relationships improved because I’m actually there during conversations. Friends and family noticed the difference. My girlfriend said I seem more engaged and attentive.

**I’m calmer.** Not being constantly stimulated reduced my baseline anxiety significantly. I don’t have that restless feeling anymore. I can just be still.

**I enjoy small things.** A good meal, a nice drive, sitting outside, conversations, all became genuinely enjoyable instead of just time to fill with content. Life got richer.

**I sleep like a human.** Not consuming content before bed means my brain can actually wind down. I fall asleep in 10 minutes instead of scrolling for an hour.

**I know myself again.** Turns out I have thoughts, opinions, preferences that aren’t just reactions to whatever content I’ve been consuming. I remembered who I actually am.

## The reality, it was uncomfortable as hell

This was one of the hardest things I’ve done. Sitting with boredom and silence when you’re addicted to stimulation feels awful. There were days I wanted to give up and just go back to constant distraction.

But pushing through that discomfort revealed that I’d been avoiding myself. All that content consumption was just a way to not think about my life, my choices, my feelings. Once I stopped avoiding, I could actually address things.

## If you’re addicted to constant stimulation:

Start with one meal today. No phone, no TV, nothing. Just you and your food. See how uncomfortable it feels. That discomfort is showing you how dependent you’ve become.

Try one drive without a podcast. Just drive and let your mind wander. Notice how hard it is to not reach for audio content.

Sit somewhere for 5 minutes without pulling out your phone. Just sit. Just be. See what thoughts come up. Most of them will be “I should check my phone” at first. That’s the addiction talking.

Use blockers that actually enforce the rules. I used Reload to block everything during the day so I couldn’t cheat even when I wanted to. External enforcement works when willpower fails.

Give it time. The first two weeks are brutal. Week three is when it starts shifting. By week six you’ll actually crave the silence. Your brain needs time to heal from constant overstimulation.

Embrace the boredom. Don’t run from it. Sit with it. Let your mind wander. That’s where all the good stuff happens. Creativity, problem solving, self awareness, all require mental downtime.

## Final thoughts

60 days ago I was terrified of silence and bored. I needed constant input to function. My attention span was destroyed. My brain was cluttered. I’d forgotten who I was under all the content consumption.

Now I crave silence. I can focus for hours. I have ideas and insights. I’m present with people. I know myself again. My brain works the way it’s supposed to.

Two months of deliberately practicing boredom completely rewired my relationship with distraction and stimulation.

Your brain is more interesting than your phone. You just have to give it space to show you.

Start today. One silent meal. One quiet drive. Five minutes of sitting without reaching for your phone. See what shows up.

The person you’ve been avoiding with all that distraction is worth getting to know.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",3,1767643308.0,getdisciplined,3,1.0,False

This one isn't about client tax strategies. It's about YOU.

Tax season is coming. And if you're anything like I was a few years ago, you're about to sacrifice your health, relationships, and sanity for the next 90+ days. 

This checklist is based on what’s called the SHiFT framework (Social, Health, Financial, Time)....use it BEFORE busy season hits to set yourself up for survival & success.

Before February 1: Set Your Boundaries

1. Have you communicated your availability windows to clients? (Example: ""I return calls Tuesdays and Thursdays. Emails within 48 hours."")
2. Did you block personal time on your calendar FIRST, before filling it with work hours?
3. Do clients know your deadline for receiving documents if they want timely filing?
4. Have you set an auto-responder with realistic turnaround times?

Check Your SHiFT Score (Rate yourself 0 to 10 in each)

* S: Social. Are you protecting at least one relationship touchpoint per week with those that matter most to you? (Dinner with spouse, call with a friend, family meal etc.)
* H: Health. Do you have a non-negotiable physical activity on your calendar? (Even 15-minute walks count)
* F: Financial. Is your pricing set so you're not trading hours for dollars at a loss?
* T: Time. Have you identified at least one morning or afternoon per week as ""protected focus time""?

Total your score and multiply by 2.5. That's your ROI on yourself right now. Ideal Goal: 100%.

Quick Wins to Protect Your Balance

* Block 7 AM to 8 AM for yourself (workout, journaling, coffee without email etc.)
* Batch similar tasks: Mondays for review, Tuesdays/Thursdays for calls, Fridays for wrap-up
* Empower your team. If you're doing things someone else could do, you're the bottleneck.
* Schedule a midseason reset day in early March. Put it on the calendar now.

One Question to Ask Yourself

""If I keep operating the way I did last busy season, what's the cost to my health, my family, and my sanity?""

If you don't like the answer, make one small SHiFT this week.

Your firm's success grows from your balance. The greater your ROI on yourself, the greater your impact on your clients.

HAPPY (and healthy) TAX SEASON!

I run a small coffee shop in Brooklyn, and last month we got hit with a really nasty article from a local blog. They claimed we had health code violations (we didn’t), but the story spread fast on social media. For a few days, it felt like our reputation was on fire  calls dropped, foot traffic slowed down, and I was honestly panicking.

We didn’t have a PR team or a crisis plan. So I had to figure it out on the fly. Here’s what we did, in case it helps anyone else:

Responded publicly but calmly  We posted a short, polite reply on the blog and our social media, stating the facts without getting defensive.

Reached out directly I emailed the blog editor with evidence (our latest health inspection report) and asked for a correction.

Pushed positive content - We posted more behind-the-scenes photos, customer stories, and good news to push the negative article down in search results.

Asked our regulars for support - A few loyal customers left nice Google reviews, which helped balance the sentiment.

It worked, but it was stressful and took a lot of time I didn’t have. If you’ve been through something similar  what did you do? Did you try anything I didn’t? Would you hire help next time?

Honestly, looking back, if the situation had been more serious - like if the article ranked high on Google and started affecting our search results long-term - I probably would've looked for professional support. I’ve heard some folks in similar situations reach out to specialized crisis management pr agency when they need to act fast and don’t have the bandwidth to handle it alone.

Would love to hear your stories or advice especially if you’ve been through this and came out the other side.

Phoenix has been covering the spread left, right, and centre – but the Rockets have won 4 of their last 5 and are a whole other breed at home. And yes, I know Phoenix just pulled off a nice win over the OKC Thunder, but the Suns also had the benefit of playing this encounter on their own court. To boot, Phoenix’s last trip to Houston saw them lose by 19 points. My money’s on the Rockets to win and cover here, friends.

Fine, I'll expense every single receipt instead.","This happened a couple weeks ago at my job in marketing. Our team had a company credit card for ""business expenses"", which included client lunches, travel, and the occasional team meal. The policy was loose, as long as it was under $50 per person and work-related, it was fine. I'd use it maybe once a week for a quick sandwich while working late, always with a receipt uploaded to our system.

Enter my new micromanaging boss, let's call him Dave. Dave decided he didn't like how ""casual"" we were with the card. During a team meeting, he announced that from now on, no one could use it for personal meals, only client-facing stuff. When I asked for clarification (since my lunches were during overtime), he snapped, ""If it's not with a client, pay for it yourself and expense it later. Follow the rules.""

Okay, Dave. Malicious compliance activated.

For the next month, I stopped using the card entirely for anything small. Instead, every single expense, coffee runs for meetings ($4.50), parking fees ($12), even a pack of pens from the office supply store ($3.99). I paid out of pocket and submitted individual expense reports. Our system required scanning receipts, filling out forms with justifications, and getting manager approval for each one. Normally, we'd batch them monthly, but the policy didn't specify, so I submitted them daily.

By week two, Dave's inbox was flooded. He had to approve 5-10 reports a day from me alone. Other team members caught on and started doing the same for their stuff. He'd grumble about it in emails: ""This is unnecessary bureaucracy."" But hey, following the rules, right?

The breaking point came during a big client pitch. We were hosting them at the office, and I was in charge of snacks. Instead of using the card for a $200 catering order, I paid personally and submitted the expense right after. Dave, swamped, didn't approve it in time, so I politely informed him during the meeting (in front of the clients) that ""per policy, I can't provide the food until the expense is cleared."" The clients were confused, the meeting stalled, and Dave had to awkwardly approve it on his phone while everyone waited.

After that, he called an emergency meeting and reversed the policy: ""Use the damn card for small stuff, just keep receipts."" Victory.

TL;DR: Boss bans company card for non-client meals, so I expense every tiny purchase individually, burying him in paperwork until he caves during a client meeting.",20,1767642494.0,MaliciousCompliance,21,0.59,False
1q4vxbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1q4vxbc/be_specific/,Be specific!,"I've manifested a lot of really big things over the years, but I wanted to share a recent success story that I find hilariously ironic and reminded me to be specific when intentionally manifesting.
A few years ago, my car started having all the problems cars have after 10 years and I felt like I was constantly getting work done on it. I was in the midst of a separation and not in the financial position to buy a new car, especially since it would be considered marital property in the divorce settlement. I started visualizing a brand new, black SUV in my driveway. I didn't focus on the make and model, just brand new, parked in front of my garage with the temp tags on it. Even though I was single, I remember cultivating the feeling that it was a surprise, something I didn't have to pay for, and there was a man (perhaps my next partner?) standing next to it with the keys and asking me if I wanted to take it for a spin. 
Fast forward about a year. Every now and then, I come back to that visualization, but still in the process of divorce and not wanting to buy a car yet. I'm at my attorney's office one afternoon signing some paperwork and ask what I should do in the event my car goes caput and I HAVE to buy a new car... well a week later the transmission goes out. I HAVE to buy a new car. 
At this point, I'm not in the financial position to buy the black SUV I've always wanted, and we're selling the house so I haven't visualized a new car in the driveway for months. I remembered a few years back seeing an orange SUV on the road and thinking it was so cute and I said to myself that I would love to find a used, fun colored car like that in my budget!
I walked into a dealership a few days later, and wouldn't you know, they had just gotten a trade in the day before that met my criteria and budget- an orange suv! It needed some work, but if I bought it, they would have it ready by the end of the week. 
Okay, so far it seems like my manifestations are coming along. I said I needed a new car, the old one removed itself from my reality and the one I wanted showed up. Not the black suv I originally wanted, but I guess some manifestations don't work out. 
Two months later, my ex husband totals his car. Freak accident that he somehow walked away from without a scratch. He's also not in the financial position to buy a new car until the house is sold, so he borrows a car for a few weeks until we finally get an offer. I'm at the house one day, cleaning up and packing with the kids (he had been living there and I had moved out) when I walk outside to see him standing in the driveway next to his BRAND NEW BLACK SUV. He holds out the keys and asks if I want to take it for a spin 🤦‍♀️ Because in my visualization, I didn't really specify that the car was for me! Just that it was a surprise and that I didn't have to pay for it! What I should have also visualized was me in the car doing my daily life, driving the kids to school, grabbing coffee, listening to music, etc. 
So here's your reminder that if you need something specific, you need to BE specific! It's okay to manifest surprises, or ask for something to come into your reality without knowing the details, just don't be surprised if it doesn't look how you wanted!",5,1767642444.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

The book was... ok, but most importantly, it helped torn down that mental blockage of attention span, and its easy story and prose made me realize that i did love to just sit and read and read and read.

now my reading habits are pretty solid, i jump genres when i'm starting to feel bored, and my consistency is there, that's in part to that day that i picked legends and lattes (and other books).

A few months ago i saw a new book coming from Travis Baldree, and was like, yeah, why not? cozy fantasy is not something that i do much often nowadays. so to prepare, i read the second one, the prequel: bookshops and bonedust. it was... ok. you could starting to see a lil something there. the author wants to bring the vibes but also do something more, beyond. did he? eh... it was a cute book, but like in any prequel, those are specially hard to bring complex stakes, even if those are small.

now i got to Brigands & Breadknives. He brings that prequel character to fulfill a cozy retirement plan, next door to the original coffee shop retirement plan from the first book. the question of ""now how will he turn this around and make it different?"" gets its answer quickly...

Light spoilers ahead:

so the rat woman hates it

she got her bookshop and she finds herself hating it, and hating her life there, but she feels guilty because she involved her friends, and asked favors to make that happen. makes sense, so we can see the meta-narrative here pretty fast ""maybe the cozy life stuff is not for everyone, maybe it gets boring if you do it too much, but you'll feel guilty if you leave it because you got other people involved, and also, that's all you've been doing (successfully) your whole life!"". cool, i get it, the author is going to work those very personal feelings in this new book, interesting to see, lets get to it!

Does he do it? that's the part where im not sure. that's the part where i'll like your opinions.

To me it reads as a meandering book of a DnD'esque  party that learns just enough about themselves. the millennial elf gets a bit of a jolt of things she has forgotten about, but we don't get to see much of it, the animated weapons stay pretty much the same, the goblin is wiser than she appears so is her arc is really an arc? i don't think she needed to learn anything. i'm not sure. 

and of course, the protagonist. she gets to a solid point of ""well, i now can ask for forgiveness but i still have no idea of what i want, i guess i'll keep looking for it"" which... yeah, valid. Its ok, we don't get a final satisfying answer. the book keeps nudging you to the red herring of she being an adventurer, which she rejects, so we get to the real answer of she being an storyteller which she makes truth... except she's still doesn't feel 100% comfortable with it, or does she? will she in the future?

which brings us back to the author's way of working though his stuff. he spells it out in the acknowledgements in the end, so this is not like an out there reading of this book; his insecurities on making something new, and leaving the ""cozy"" stuff behind and all that. But did he get an answer? i don't think so. and yeah, that's just life and all that but... well, was the meandering to a non answer worth it? that's the shitty part because as days pass, i don't think it was wort it for me particularly. i guess it was the execution? i mean, i looove Hands of the Emperor so, i know i love meandering long books if i get to connect with the characters. so maybe it was that? that i didn't connect with the foul mouthed rat woman?

One thing that i'll give BIG kudos to Travis is that he worked through it! instead of sitting in his ass for a decade+ living of his legend (u know who i'm talking about) he decided to put all those uncomfortable thoughts and insecurities on paper. Now that's a lesson i can not only agree, but i hope to follow. Do the thing even if you're feeling insecure and stressed af!

1q4vtcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1q4vtcn/are_we_really_politically_literate/,Are we really politically literate?,"I was discussing with one of my former college mate. Niko bado kwa hometown yangu na my friend is still back in Nairobi, alichoose kustay hapo and since my leave is almost over nakuja Nairobi. So recently tulikuwa tunabonga na kuna question ilifly between us. Aliuliza about which coffee brand is good? Na unaweza ask why this whole thing was triggered by coffee but I am getting there.

Nilimwambia that I usually take local brand coffees hata kaa ni expensive, mostly preferring somali or Ethiopian coffee juu these are more floral and not as stringent, na ni type I had grown up drinking. Nikasema that in Nairobi, nanunuanga coffee beans na kuziroast na kuzisaga nyumbani juu ni cultural na I have control over the type of roast...

Blah blah, now we are getting to the gist of the story. Akaniambia that anaprefer Nescafe... na nikasema off handedly that I have boycotted Nestle for like 9 years now. Akaniuliza what Nestle has done... na I explained that their actions are too long na I just directed him to a tiktok video na YouTube video that explains Nestle(what they did to Africa in particular). This is the same way nime boycott hadi coca cola(because of what happened to Mexico), na hadi unnecessary tech items, because nanuanga phones only when mine imeharibika and I need changing(juu ya congo)... na I try to support local kenyan made companies na business na farms.

I realised that while talking to people, that wengi are not literate politically, and sadly wengi wako na hii veil over their eyes. Sitaki kusema that some are willfully ignorant, juu some that I have talked to have genuinely researched the informations, but most are so willfully arrogant in their ignorance, and its deeply saddening. Juu kuna time one person aliniambia that ""Kwani pesa yako itawaumiza wao?"" And nika reply that even if haitawumiza, it is better that my soul rests and morality yangu haiwezi niallow to support kitu when I know haitakuwa for the betterment of others.  

The conversation about coffee triggered a whole discussion about politics. Na sometimes knowledge is a curse because there are so many things at play that unaweza jidhani uko conspiracy theorist. Kama wakenya we have so many ways to research information...

1q4vsia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1q4vsia/something_i_noticed_about_couples_who_actually/,something i noticed about couples who actually last,"This isn’t a hot take. It’s just something I kept noticing after watching relationships around me quietly fall apart.

Not because of cheating. Not because of huge fights. But because once things slowed down, once life got repetitive and boring, the relationship didn’t know what to do with itself.

No excitement meant no connection. Silence felt like a problem. Calm felt like something was wrong.

That made me curious, so I went digging. Not in a “how to save your relationship” way, but in a “why does this keep happening” way. Turns out there’s a pretty consistent explanation.

---

One of the biggest indicators of a healthy relationship isn’t passion or chemistry. It’s whether two people can exist together without constant stimulation.

Can you sit in the same room doing nothing and not feel awkward?  
Can a quiet weekend pass without someone starting a fight just to feel something?  
Can boredom exist without being mistaken for loss of love?

A lot of couples fail right there.

---

Therapists talk about this more than social media does. Esther Perel has mentioned that long-term connection isn’t about avoiding monotony. It’s about how couples relate *inside* it. People who stay curious about each other don’t panic when things slow down. People who confuse intensity with intimacy do.

That’s where problems creep in.

---

Another thing that shows up in research is emotional regulation. Not communication skills. Not “using the right words.” Just the ability to handle your own stress without dumping it onto the other person.

Couples who last aren’t better at talking. They’re better at calming themselves down. When tension rises, they don’t immediately turn the relationship into a battlefield.

That matters more than people want to admit.

---

Conflict itself isn’t the issue either. Everyone argues. What matters is whether the relationship still feels emotionally safe during and after disagreement.

Do you feel like you can repair things, or do conflicts leave lingering fear and distance? Secure relationships recover. Insecure ones collect damage.

---

Something surprisingly small also makes a difference. Shared routines.

Not big romantic gestures. Tiny, boring rituals. Morning coffee. Evening walks. Checking in before bed. These create a sense of “us” that survives when nothing exciting is happening.

Without them, people drift without realizing it.

---

And maybe the most uncomfortable truth of all:

At some point, attraction fades into friendship. If you don’t genuinely like each other, that’s where everything collapses.

Not shared hobbies. Not sex. Not compatibility on paper. Actual enjoyment of each other’s presence.

If everything external disappeared, would you still want to sit next to them?

---

Most relationships feel incredible at the beginning. New things usually do.

The real test is what happens when nothing special is going on. When life is quiet. When there’s no story to tell.

I stopped by a coffee shop I don’t even go to that often, maybe once every couple weeks, usually when I’m running late. I walked up half-awake, staring at the menu like it was written in another language.

I laughed because I genuinely had to think about whether that was correct. It was. Exactly right.

She said, “You always hesitate for like five seconds before ordering, so I figured today I’d save you the trouble.”

It wasn’t a big thing, but it felt nice being recognized without being noticed, if that makes sense. Like my existence left a soft outline somewhere.

How was that one?""  And then I say....



Ohhhh my gosh was this one spicy! But here's the thing, it was also very very good. The FMC (Violet) is a plus size baker. Baking is her passion and her comfort. She has self esteem issues, I'll come back to that, she tries so hard to be the peacemaker and is a chronic people pleaser. She also has fertility issues and self esteems issues. I found her instantly likable and relatable. Her ex is getting married to her sister, and they both treat her terribly. They are making fun of her for going to the wedding alone when through shenanigans that can only happen in a smutty book, her ex's three older, much better looking, much nicer, and much more successful brothers all say they are going as her date at the same time. And rather than back tracking and clearing things up, they double down. Triple down? And the ""fake dating"" trope begins. I loved how wholesome and supportive these three men were. Sometimes Violets self deprecating attitude felt like a bit much, but mostly she was just voicing those feelings of inadequacy that so any of us have. Was it a reflection of a truly healthy viable relationship? Oh gosh no. But hearing them reassure her, encourage her, helping her see not just her own physical beauty, but her self worth and potential was heart warming. It honestly and legitimately made me smile and feel good as she learns to believe in herself and see herself in a better light. That's not to say I'd put this book on the ""entirely wholesome"" shelf. It absolutely goes on the smut shelf, behind a little red curtain, with that little sign that says ""18+ only"".  But it's that combination of spicey and wholesome that seems to be my sweet spot. And I'm going to try more Eva Ashwood and hope they have this same flavor.

I reached out a couple of days after the breakup offering support if she wanted it, and she was very kind but said she couldn’t accept it. I accepted that, and didn’t text again for a good while. During that time she watched all of my stories like it was a part time job, even if she was travelling (went back home to Australia for the holidays) or with family/friends.

I texted her a couple of days ago asking if we could go for coffee or just generally talk before we go back to our postgrads. It turned out that she’s extended her trip so she’s still in Australia, but she was happy to have a conversation and offered to FaceTime. I didn’t feel like it was fair to do that because I didn’t want to take away from her family time, so we agreed to talk when she’s back in the country we’re both studying in in a couple of weeks.

1q4vivz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1q4vivz/how_to_build_a_morning_routine_that_doesnt_suck/,How to Build a MORNING ROUTINE That Doesn't Suck: The Science-Based Guide You Actually Need,"I used to think morning routines were BS reserved for productivity influencers and people who unironically enjoy green smoothies at 5am. Then I spent months diving into sleep research, behavioral psychology, podcasts with actual scientists (not just self-help gurus), and realized most morning routine advice is completely backwards. We're told to wake up at some ungodly hour and immediately meditate for 45 minutes like some enlightened monk, but nobody's addressing why your current morning feels like dragging yourself through concrete.

Here's what I learned from digging through research and experimenting on myself. Your morning doesn't suck because you lack discipline. It sucks because you're fighting against your biology, your actual life circumstances, and advice designed for people who don't exist. The cortisol awakening response kicks in within 30 minutes of waking, your adenosine levels (the sleep chemical) are still elevated, and your prefrontal cortex (decision making center) isn't fully online yet. So yeah, no wonder that 5am workout routine lasted three days.

**The biggest mistake is trying to build the ""perfect"" morning instead of one that actually works for YOUR brain and YOUR life.** Stop copying some CEO's routine. They have a personal chef, no commute, and probably didn't sleep like shit because their neighbor's car alarm went off at 2am.

Start with understanding your chronotype. This isn't woo woo stuff, it's legit circadian biology. Dr. Matthew Walker covers this extensively in his sleep research, basically some people are genuinely wired to wake earlier (larks) and others later (owls). If you're an owl, forcing yourself into a 5am routine is like running your system in the wrong operating mode. You can shift it slightly over time, but fighting your natural rhythm creates cortisol spikes and screws with your mood for the entire day.

**Build backwards from your non-negotiables.** What HAS to happen in your morning? Kids need to get to school? Work starts at 8? That's your anchor. Now work backwards. If you need 30 minutes to not feel rushed, wake up 30 minutes before that time. Not 2 hours. Not when it's still dark and your soul hurts. 30 minutes. You can always add more later, but starting with something stupidly achievable builds the actual habit loop.

The researchers Andrew Huberman talks with on his podcast emphasize light exposure within the first hour of waking. This isn't about buying a $300 SAD lamp, just get outside for 5-10 minutes or sit by a window. Sunlight triggers cortisol production (good cortisol, the wake-up kind) and sets your circadian clock. This single thing improved my energy more than any supplement or biohack. On cloudy days you need a bit longer because the lux levels are lower, but it still works.

**Most people sabotage mornings the night before.** Your morning routine actually starts at like 9pm. If you're scrolling TikTok until midnight with your phone blasting blue light into your retinas, your melatonin production is suppressed and your sleep quality tanks. The book ""Why We Sleep"" by Dr. Matthew Walker is legitimately the best sleep science book that exists, he's a neuroscience professor at UC Berkeley and his research on sleep's impact on literally everything (mood, metabolism, immune function, memory) is wild. One of those reads that makes you immediately change your behavior because the data is that compelling.

Here's the thing about those elaborate 17-step morning routines. They fail because they require too much activation energy when your brain is still booting up. Instead, create an automatic sequence. James Clear talks about habit stacking in ""Atomic Habits"" (insanely practical book, zero fluff, just behavioral science you can actually use). Link your new habit to an existing one. When coffee starts brewing, I do X. After I brush my teeth, I do Y. Your brain loves patterns and this removes the decision fatigue.

**Don't make your morning routine another thing to fail at.** If you miss a day, you didn't blow it. Life happens. You're building resilience here, not chasing perfection. The goal is a morning that gives you energy and headspace, not one that feels like passing a daily inspection.

Try the app Finch for habit building if you need external accountability that doesn't feel preachy. It's weirdly effective because you're taking care of a little bird character, and somehow that gamification makes it easier to show up for yourself. The morning check-ins are gentle but keep you honest.

Another tool worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and Google engineers. It turns high-quality knowledge sources like research papers, expert interviews, and books into personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans. You can customize the length and depth based on your schedule, from 10-minute summaries during your commute to 40-minute deep dives when you have time.

The app creates a structured learning plan around your specific goals and struggles. Plus, you get a virtual coach avatar that you can chat with anytime for recommendations or explanations. It's useful for building morning knowledge habits without feeling overwhelmed, especially when you're still figuring out your routine.

The most underrated morning move is doing one hard thing first. Not the hardest thing in your entire day, just something slightly uncomfortable. Cold water on your face for 30 seconds. Ten pushups.

1q4vhz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q4vhz0/an_ascension/,An Ascension,"I was excited as I turned the lights off and climbed into bed that night. For the first time in a good long while I had been enjoying my evenings in a way that felt natural. No longer was I up until two or three in the morning, the blue light of my computer monitor burning my eyeballs until I would finally cave to exhaustion. Instead, it was a little after ten, and I had already gotten nice and comfortable as I slipped on my headphones and began the preparatory process of my evening meditation.

I’d been implementing the practice every night for about a month. It all started after one long, late night conversation with a buddy from class. Jake was about as opposite a person from myself as one could be, but that was why I enjoyed his company. Talking to him was just… easier. I didn’t feel as though I had to hide behind any preconceived notions of who I was. There was no mask. And for a kid from a good family, raised in a good church, who always had good grades and whom everyone referred to as “a good guy”, having a friend like Jake meant having someone with whom I could have brutally honest conversation with. I could ask the questions that I would never dream of burdening family or life-long friends with. Questions of faith, life, meaning, or any number of topics that, after striking out on my own, I quickly realized the answers I possessed were not of my own choice; they had all been thrust upon me by my environment. Conversing openly with Jake led me to realize that my upbringing had cemented itself more deeply and firmly than what I noticed was normal amongst my peers, and I was beginning to confront what this meant for me, especially on a psychological level.

“Me personally,” Jake had said during one of our first conversations, “I can’t get behind organized religion. Not to say I don’t believe in God; I just find the idea of boxing him into strict categories ridiculous. I mean, we’re talking about a being, a divine entity that supposedly brought all things into existence. And what, we’re supposed to believe he only shared the specifics of how to get in touch with him with the Jews or the Indians? With the Christians or the Muslims or the Buddhists? I don’t know man. I don’t want to believe in a God who seems to have just written off entire people groups, you know?”

I can still remember how angry I’d been at his words. But I hadn’t had a good rebuttal. It was the first time I’d had my faith questioned so openly. I honestly hadn’t known how to respond. I wouldn’t have ever talked with him again if our philosophy professor hadn’t assigned us a group project for the first term on day one. But after a couple of nights spent working together over beers and cigars, Jake quickly became that archetypal college friend, the one I can’t separate from my college experience at all.

During our sophomore year, I’d been complaining about how messy and chaotic my mind felt. I was still going to church, praying and reading my bible, but I was constantly battling a feeling of being ‘on edge’. I couldn’t relax, and my chest hurt from an undiagnosable tightness.

That was when Jake had recommended I try meditation, transcendental meditation specifically. He said he’d been practicing it for years, and that his parents had taught it to him at a young age. Jake's parents were textbook hippies, the chill kind that didn’t pretend it was still 1969. I couldn’t stop the alarm bells from going off in my head at the mention of meditation—mental images of demonic yogis and deceiving cult leaders flashing through my mind. Jake must have picked up on my hesitation. “Relax man,” he’d said. “This isn’t gonna open a portal to hell or whatever. It’s just an exercise for your mind. Take what works for you, discard what doesn’t. I think you’d really benefit from it. It might help you relax and get to the root of whatever is bothering you.”

He sent me a short video, a guided meditation that I saved to my watch-later list and proceeded to ignore for a couple days. It wasn’t that I didn’t trust Jake, but you have to understand; I was seriously raised that this stuff was demonic, that by emptying my mind in an “un-Christ-like” way, I would be opening myself to spiritual attack—possession, madness, apostasy. But, as my own attempts to relieve myself continued to bear no fruit, I decided it was worth the risk. And after my first session, I was hooked.

The only way to describe it is that, for the first time in what felt like years, I felt true peace. My muscles relaxed. My jaw unclenched. The tightness in my chest disappeared. The surface-level thoughts, worries about school and life and the future, all melted away. I found clarity in those thirty minutes that I hadn’t managed to attain in years of bible studies and prayer meetings. I felt… myself.

And so, I kept practicing. I talked about my experiences with Jake. He was happy for me, happy that it was working. I started dreaming again—when had I stopped dreaming? I started tracking my dreams, writing about them, mining them for meaning. My grades, which had been slacking slightly, jumped right back up. My hesitation and indecisiveness disappeared. And, most importantly, I felt as though I had discovered something that had been purposefully left out of my faith, like I’d found a hidden truth—one buried beneath pounds of misplaced superstition.

I didn’t lose my faith. If anything, it grew stronger. I still went to church, to prayer, but with a newfound vigor. And while my attempts to share what I had found with friends from church were met with blank or nervous stares, I wasn’t discouraged. Not even in the slightest. Meditation quickly became routine, one I stuck to, well, religiously. I talked with Jake about it constantly, so much so that I think I began to annoy him a little. Every day, I was asking for tips, advice on breathing, how to clear my mind further, how to really dive deep and connect with myself. This went on for a while. Until one night, while drinking at a local brewery, he looked me dead in the eye and said.

“Dude, listen, you’re trying too hard. Just let whatever happens, happen. Let go.”

His words bounced around in my head for the rest of the evening, until he had to leave to meet a girl and I decided to go home. As I had for months, I got everything together, lay down, started a free-flow guided meditation, and closed my eyes.

*Just let go. Just let go. Whatever happens, happens*. I repeated what Jake had said to me over and over again as I drifted into a deeply relaxed state of mind. I felt my body loosen, felt my eyes grow heavy while my mind grew sharp. I let my thoughts drift across my mind, ignoring the temptation to analyze or interact with them in any way. I breathed deeply, inhaling through my nose, smelling the ever-present odor of a musty college dorm room, and exhaling through pursed lips while humming slightly in my throat. I kept this up for several minutes, until something happened that had never happened before.

I felt my body begin to tingle. I lost track of my limbs, of the point of contact where flesh met bed sheet. My head felt like it was lolling to the side, further and further, dragging my body along with it in an ever-upwards spiral. Ever upwards, up and up and up, until the very meaning of the motion was lost upon me. A part of my mind, that distant, caged fear of the unknown, threatened to panic; to pull me from the experience. But I continued to recite Jake's words in my mind. *Just let go. Just let go. Whatever happens, happens.* I kept my mind clear. I knew what was happening, logically. I’d read about out-of-body experiences, but I was shocked to find myself within one. I fought the urge to flee, to think, and focused on just being.

I found myself in an old church, the stones covered in moss, cracked and broken. It was a cathedral. Why was it a cathedral? I wasn’t Catholic, never even been to mass. A gargoyle, half its face broken, glared down at me with one gray eye. I entered the church. The roof had caved in, silvery moonlight streaming in from a distant, unfamiliar sky. The light was cold against my skin. I walked between the rotten wooden pews, the stench of mildew and mothballs thick in the stale air. The moonlight ignited the large stained glass windows of the cathedral; icons of saints watched me as I approached the altar. The cross loomed down from above the altar; old, dry wooden beams stained red. But something was wrong. Christ hung from the cross, but a hood was over his face. I felt heat within me, a burning sensation, a need to know, to unveil, to reveal my God's face. I reached up with a pale, ghostly hand, wisps of moonlight bouncing from my skin. The room grew brighter and brighter as I neared the base of the hood. Nothing could have prepared me for what I found beneath it.

I stared into green eyes. Messy blond hair. A square face, too young to have the wrinkles it did around its mouth and above its cheeks. Cauliflower ears from years spent wrestling in high school. A fleshy pink mole on the right side of the neck.

I stared at myself. I don’t know how long. I was dead before my own eyes. Thunder sounded above the cross. Lightning from a rainless storm rained down bolts of blinding light from above. The cathedral shook, collapsing in on itself. And never once did I move.

The sound of a slamming door woke me from sleep. Sunlight filtered in through the window, as did a cold breeze.

“Holy shit are you okay?”

The pain came next. My right wrist ached. I turned to look at the window. It was broken; I’d broken it in my sleep and cut my wrist. All at once I truly woke, my senses firing as I gasped in pain and clutched my wrist. My roommate David hurried to my side and pulled out his phone to call 911. I stared at the blood as it dripped down my arm. I stared at my face in a piece of shattered glass that had fallen into my bed, the crystalline edge only a few inches away from where my neck had been.

What passed between then and now is all a blur. I dropped out of school—I couldn’t find the strength to go to class. I stopped going to church—I wasn’t sure why I’d ever gone in the first place. I lost touch with Jake, despite his best efforts to be there for me. I don’t know. Maybe a part of me blames him. I’m writing this from a small coffee shop near a park in Seattle. I don’t know who will read this. Maybe it shouldn’t be read, the words of a drunken dropout. I don’t dream much anymore, neither do I sleep. But when I do, I still see that cross. I still walk between the pews of that cathedral. And I still remember the first coherent thought that crossed my mind as I stared into that piece of broken glass.

*There was no God on The Cross.*

**I'm freshly 49, male, in good health, live in NY, and have moderate OA in both hips with joint narrowing and osteophytes.**

**Today, I had my first PRP shot in one hip joint and, if the results are good, I'll do the other one. Here's what happened...**

I went to Columbia Doctors in Manhattan, paid $950 out of pocket (as far as I know, PRP for hip OA is not covered by insurance). 

A nurse checked my vitals, asked if I'd had breakfast and was hydrated (I was, kinda; I wish I'd thought about this earlier), and she handed me 2 cups of water, just in case. I'd had a sweet drink on my way into the clinic.

Another nurse did my blood draw. I didn't look but I could feel it – he used a butterfly needle and when I looked after he was done, he had taken a large amount of blood into the chamber – I'm not sure how much but it looked like a coffee mug's worth! He explained that it would produce 7ml of PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) – which is the largest amount they use, as the hip is such a large joint. He took it away to the centrifuge. 

15 mins later I went into another room where the ultrasound was set up. I changed into a pair of shorts (given to me by the nurse) and lay down. The doctor checked my hip with the ultrasound, then sterilized the area. She then injected some anaesthetic into the hip area (the injection site was at the front of the top of the leg, not at the side as I had imagined). This felt a little uncomfortable but it was fine. 

Then, using ultrasound again, another needle was inserted – again, I didn't look – it might have been the same one?? And then the doctor hooked up my PRP and injected it in.

The needle was uncomfortable for sure – I couldn't exactly pinpoint it but the sensation was exactly where it is when I'm having a flare up – only a little sharper. Again, I couldn't ""feel"" the PRP being injected but it was uncomfortable again – and started to ache at once. And then, a moments later, it was done. I got a band aid over the injection site and that was that!   
  
I wouldn't quite call it pain, but it throbbed quite a bit. ""This is why we only do one hip at a time,"" said the doc. I was able to stand fine but walked out with a bit of stiffness, a mild limp, and they gave me a set of crutches (charged to my insurance) to keep. The pain/throbbing started to subside within 30 mins. They recommended I get a taxi home. I was at the clinic for about an hour, maybe less. They were all super friendly and speedy and professional.

I've now resting up at home and have taken some Tylenol (no NSAIDS for 2+ weeks). I can expect some inflammation and maybe pain in the next 24 hours or so. 

The discharge notes say to Rest on days 0-3, use crutches if needed, and days 4-14 – stop using crutches if your pain has improved, and try some ""gentle stretching exercises.""

I'll update this post with anything important, including the results.

I wrote this in case anyone is thinking of trying the same thing :) Apologies if this is repeating anything already shared here. Thanks!  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Background: I was diagnosed via X-Ray just over 8 months ago. It was a shock – I didn't know much about OA, and thought I was too young – but it also made sense. I'd had ""tight"" hips for years, and if I got a cold, flu or Covid, my hips would really ache. But my personal trainer – and me – thought I just had chronic tightness due to running, working out, and LOTS of desk time. Cue lots of deep squats and stretching, plus the ""frog"" pose which always seemed to make me feel worse (I wish I'd paid a bit more attention to this).

I ended up with what I now know was a big flare up. In pain, I went to physio who recommended an X-Ray, and that's how I was diagnosed. I then connected with a Sports MD at Columbia. She's great and gave me some good advice: modify the way you work out (if it hurts, don't do it), go to physio, be healthy, do Reformer Pilates, be less stressed. And the physio told me to stop sitting at my desk so much (I started with 20 min blocks, standing and then sitting). 

I took their advice and, slowly, the flare up subsided. I sometimes use ice packs, and occasionally I take an NSAID. But I'm now more aware of the triggers. I wear squishier shoes now, too. I miss running, though.",2,1767641203.0,Osteoarthritis,4,1.0,False

A few years back this game popped up in (I think) an indie/cosy game showcase and it piqued my interest. I remember it might have been something like Coffee Talk’s playable story style game. From what I recall, it was about some kind of dystopia/Black Mirror-esque reality where (and this is a vague recollection) you as the player are acting as a ‘proxy’ therapist; where AI has advanced to the point that it’s used to generate therapy responses, but due to AI lacking the human connection/a body, human beings are employed to relay the AI responses to clients. 

I believe the word proxy was either in the title or heavily used in the trailer. I also am pretty sure I saw it during the Covid years, so I imagine the trailer came out in 2020-2022 with a release date shortly after that.

1q4v9jf,https://i.redd.it/7oemjz790lbg1.jpeg,Nano vs Mino - Pre-Ground Coffee,"TLDR: Mino wins! Even when comparing amino stock basket and Nano w/ Basket Plus. 

Decided to do a real world comparison today. I have some leftover pre-ground grocery store coffee I bought while moving houses. Need to use it up. 

There have been multiple times when traveling or camping that haven’t wanted to (or couldn’t) bring my grinder and fresh beans. 

Mino: stock system (12g pressurized basket). 12g coffee in , 25g out in ~13 seconds. 

Nano: Basket Plus. 16g coffee in (couldn’t fit 18g), 35g out in ~7 seconds. 

The pressurized basket on Mino definitely helps out here. Got some decent crème for it being pre ground coffee, some decent texture and pretty balanced acidity. Tasted like an espresso shot made with pre-ground coffee and even had a few notes of dried fruit like the bag says it should. 

The Nano resulted in a drink much closer to tea than espresso. Not horrible, but no crème, no body and nearly no flavor. The flavor it did have wasn’t unpleasant, just nothing distinctive. This makes sense to me with how fast the water runs through. No resistance means no contact time which means minimal extraction. 

I know I could have used the original Nano pressurized basket that holds 6-7g to get more extraction. But needing to do two 6g shots to match the Mino seems terrible. And things would get cold. 

For the situations where I can’t take a grinder and don’t want to spend the money on pods, I’m definitely taking the Mino with me.

Khair, we got a hotspot from a lady and that’s how she contacted her guy. At first, he was saying that he wouldn’t be able to come. She understood and I felt a little peace.

My dad called me and asked when he should pick me up. I told him to pick us up at 7 pm. It was already around 6:30 pm when the guy texted again saying that he *would* be coming.

That’s when I completely lost it and started panicking and told her not to meet the guy because if my dad saw them together he’d be mad at me and I was too scared of what he would do afterwards. She promised me she’d only meet him for ten minutes and we’d be back before my father arrived.

Minutes went by. She was in the car with him for a good twenty minutes and that’s when the bomb dropped on me, my dad came and saw her in the car and he glared at me. He looked so disappointed.

He came inside the café where I was sitting and that’s when he called my friend’s dad and told him everything. Her father came to pick her up and I don’t know what happened at her end because she’s been offline since then.

My father isn’t talking to me and he said that he didn’t expect me to deceive him like this. I don’t know what to do. I’m so scared.",8,1767640963.0,IslamabadSocial,24,1.0,False

He’s not someone I’ve been in touch with at all in the last 5 years. But he randomly texted me a couple of days and I thought it would be good to catch up. I am on decent to good terms with most of the men I’ve dated.

He’s married for the last 3 years (arranged marriage), has 2 kids, runs his own businesses. His family had a host of businesses even when we were dating but he wasn’t actively doing any work. Nor was he ambitious at the time which was one of the reasons we broke it off.

When we met today, we did a bit of small talk. I asked about his wife(27F) and what she does professionally. I expressed surprise that she got married at 24, and he made a comment that I got married really late since I got married at 29 because girls in his community get married at 21. Basically started glorifying marrying early. I’m not against it, to each their own, but everyone has a different perspective.

Then we started talking about kids and I mentioned that my husband and I weren’t planning on having any because we wanted a DINK lifestyle and weren’t ready for that responsibility. Again, started pushing his perspective on me.

I couldn’t think of more to say so I asked if he had travelled for leisure or gone for any vacations recently since it was festive season and end of year. Then he said that he travels for work and his wife comes along and they usually get to have small trips in between because of it.

I agreed that that was convenient and better than working in corporate because we have desk jobs and have to take leaves specifically to travel. He then started showing off about his businesses and travelling within the country. Basically every second sentence was layered with showing off of some kind, on every topic we spoke on. On the vacation front, I mentioned I’d been out of the country recently and was planning another trip later this year with my husband.

He started mocking me with condescension about him being busy because of all his businesses. Then I told him I was shifting to another city soon. He said that the current city we live in is perfect and why would I want to leave. The air pollution here is intolerable and my husband and I collectively decided to move base and hopefully migrate and settle somewhere else. He started sharing stuff like it’s not good to run after money blah blah.

At one point, I had enough. The whole time we were talking, I realised that his personality had a 180 makeover and I no longer recognised this person. I had no clue why he was showing off or spouting conservative crap.

I called him out on it very clearly and said I think meeting was a bad idea. He just started showing of some more regarding political connections. I got up and walked off. This whole interaction was 20 minutes. In the cab, I texted him that this was not an acquaintance I wanted to continue and blocked him.

I took a deep sigh and realised what a bullet I dodged. Also realised how much I value my own time.

1q4v5jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1q4v5jm/how_to_stop_being_lazy_af_productivity_hacks_that/,How to stop being lazy AF: productivity hacks that actually work from science not TikTok,"Let’s be real. Everyone lowkey struggles with laziness. Especially now. You scroll  you doom-watch  then you wonder why you can’t get yourself to do basic life chores or finish that one task that’s been haunting you for weeks. And when you search for ""how to stop being lazy ” you’re hit with a flood of IG reels and TikToks telling you to just ""wake up at 5am and grind"" or ""drink lemon water and romanticize your life.” Honestly  most of it is either influencer cosplay or straight-up unscientific fluff.

So here’s a post to cut through that. Based on actual research  psychology  and books that don’t get enough love. Laziness isn't a personality flaw. It’s usually a symptom. Low energy  overwhelm  perfectionism  fear of failure  dopamine burnout. But here’s the good news: this stuff can be learned  trained  and upgraded. Like a mental OS update.

Curated from peak productivity books  obscure behavioral psych studies  and top-tier podcasts like  Huberman Lab  and  The Tim Ferriss Show .

You ready? Let’s go.

You’re not lazy  you’re energy mismanaged  

Stanford behavioral scientist BJ Fogg  in  Tiny Habits   explains that laziness is often a misdiagnosis. People don’t have a motivation problem. They have a  system  problem. Big tasks feel overwhelming  so the brain resists.

 Fix:  Start with micro-habits that take under 2 minutes. Not “read a book” but “open the Kindle app.” Not “clean your room” but “put one sock in the laundry.” Once you start  momentum builds. This works because of the psychological principle called the Zeigarnik Effect (incomplete tasks stress us into finishing them).

Laziness = dopamine dysregulation  not lack of willpower  

Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman breaks this down in his episode on dopamine burnout. Scrolling endlessly trains your brain to expect  instant  dopamine hits. Real-world tasks? Delayed payoff. So your brain says “meh.”

 Fix:  Cut back on cheap dopamine. Short-term dopamine fasts (even 4 hours of tech-free time) can reset your brain’s reward circuitry. You’ll start finding focus less boring again. Pair this with “task bracketing” (set a very clear start and end boundary for a task)  which makes it seem less infinite and overwhelming.

 Perfectionism is just fancy laziness with better PR  

Dr. Brené Brown calls perfectionism “a twenty-ton shield.” It masks fear of failure  not high standards. You delay action because you can’t stand the idea of doing it  imperfectly . So nothing gets done.

 Fix:  Follow the “shitty first draft” method from author Anne Lamott. Write the ugly version. Build a broken prototype. Act like  nobody  will see it. This switches your brain from outcome-focused to process-focused. Which is what actually builds habits.Your environment isn't neutral. It’s either draining or driving you  

 James Clear in  Atomic Habits  said it best: “Environment is the invisible hand that shapes behavior.” A cluttered space  distracting phone  noisy people? All silently pushing you into inaction.

 Fix:  Design your environment to make laziness harder. Put friction between you and your vices (e.g.  delete apps  unplug your router after 10pm). Reduce friction for good habits (keep your journal on your pillow  set up your workspace the night before).

Your calendar is lying to you  Most people fill their calendars with meetings and TO-DOs but leave zero time for actual DOING. According to Cal Newport ( Deep Work )  this causes “attention residue.” You half-task and feel like you worked all day but achieved nothing.Fix:  Use  time blocking  for deep focus. Not just “do emails” but “9:00–9:45 respond to 10 emails.” Reserve 2+ hours a day with zero meetings or phone use. Even 1 hour of real deep work beats 6 hours of shallow attention.

Motivation can’t be trusted  but momentum can  A 2011 study from the  Journal of Behavioral Decision Making  found that progress feedback significantly increased task completion rates. Meaning  it’s not motivation that keeps us going  it’s progress we can see.Fix:  Use “visible progress tracking.” Habit trackers  Notion dashboards  or even just a sticky note checklist. Don’t aim for perfection. Aim for streaks. A chain of 3 days is already enough to rewire your self-perception from lazy to active.

you don’t need “discipline ” you need better scaffolding  

This one’s from Dr. Katy Milkman’s book  How to Change . She found that people build habits better when there’s “temptation bundling”  pairing something you love (like music or coffee) with something hard (like running or studying).Fix:  Only watch your favorite Netflix show while folding laundry. Only grab your daily barista coffee if you wrote 200 words first. This tricks your reward system into craving the hard task too.

Laziness isn’t a curse. It’s a signal. And most of the time  it’s not even about the task. It’s about the  invisible weights  making the task harder than it needs to be. The weights can be removed. Your system can be rebuilt.Most viral advice is vibes  not science. But if you change the structure  the behavior tends to follow. Willpower is unreliable. But routines? Environments? Dopamine setups? Those are hackable.

Let lazy be a phase  not a personality.

1q4v3ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1q4v3ps/pressure/,Pressure,"Shannon is a stickler for procedure, and always has been. A broken rule is as dangerous to her as a broken bone, and she’s never been shy about voicing her displeasure when things go awry. On the first night of our honeymoon she yelled at me in the middle of a restaurant for not pushing my chair in all the way when we got up to leave. I remember standing, slack-jawed and full of hurt, as she chewed me out for being inconsiderate and stupid. I remember falling asleep that night with her turned fully away from me on the bed. The next day, she slapped me across the face for leaving a book on the bed. 

I’m often at the receiving end of her temper. Despite managing my own mistakes, Shannon also uses me as an outlet for people outside our home that can’t seem to adhere to her rules. I’ve heard more than enough about her boss that chews too much and the kids across the street who leave their bicycles in our driveway. After all these years of marriage you would think that I would have built the stomach for them, but the mere idea of her screaming at me is still enough to make my whole body shake. I’m brave enough to admit that I can’t handle it. I’m scared enough to do anything I can to prevent it. Over the years I’ve learned that it is always easier to ask her before I commit to something. I have a terrible memory and she has a phenomenal radar for those making mistakes. 

I have built my life upon Shannon’s rules in order to maintain peace for the both of us. Her morning mug must always contain ¾ coffee and ¼ cream. The TV’s volume must never be at an even number. The car cannot have more than one cup in the cupholders. The hand soap must never smell like citrus. The credit card bill must never exceed three hundred dollars. Friends cannot come to our house without notifying her four days in advance. For twenty years I have managed to scrape by with only a few thrown toasters, screaming tantrums, and snide, disparaging words. 

She’s wonderful in those alternate moments. She loves to say that I’m the perfect man for her and that I’m such an incredible listener. It’s nice to have that quiet, when we can curl up on the couch (with our feet on the ottoman, never ever on the floor) and snuggle. I like to feel as though I’m doing the right thing by making her happy. It’s a simple arrangement, really. Life can even be pleasant when everything must be one particular way. I’ve adapted. 

But today I am scared again. 

The day’s violent storm brought a tree down upon the house. I returned home from work and resisted the urge to call the insurance company, because Shannon always said that they are all scammers who will steal our money. I am panicking about what she will say, and the certain hell she will raise over all this damage. I turn off the engine and step through the barely-functioning door. I call her name a few times, but nobody answers. I can feel my heartbeat in my mouth. 

*What did I forget? Is she mad at me?* 

The living room has been pulverized. The tree ripped a hole down the middle of the house, collapsing our fireplace and almost all of the structure. Shannon’s antique teacups are in pieces, scattered about the floor. I almost have a heart attack right then and there at the sight of them. She’s definitely infuriated. I call for her one more time and with less confidence. No one replies. Her phone must be dead, another rule broken. 

I am desperate to salvage the situation. I fix what I know. The rug is facing the wrong direction, the shelves on the wall are askew, the wind is too loud against the remaining window panes. The grime and dirt can be managed, but I have to do it right away. 

I can almost hear her howling about everything that has happened, and can almost feel the pain in my jaw as if she is winding up right now. I desperately move around the room, water occasionally splashing in my face and soaking my clothes. I manage to somewhat pull the kitchen back together, but I will need to ask her what to do about the tree. It’s cumbersome and tearing the house apart even further. 

*Who do you call if not insurance? Maybe a handyman of hers–*

I am distracted from my thoughts by a creaking sound in the bedroom, the sound of wood cracking and breaking. I take hesitant steps towards the doorway and peer inside. The roof has fallen the most here, the top of the tree having smashed it through entirely. This is not what gives me pause. 

Stomach-down on the carpet is Shannon. Her body is visible. Her head is not. There are giant wooden beams and blocks of concrete on the spot where her head should connect to her neck. Every second the rain beats into us, the pillars and concrete are slowly settling. A red puddle blooms, squelching low and in rhythm with the sloshing of the water in the room.

And I’m standing here paralyzed with my phone in my hand. I cannot remember the ambulance rule. I cannot remember if Shannon would want me to call someone. She won’t answer. I prod her shoe with my foot (but not her ankle, never ever touch her ankles) and nothing happens. Thunder booms outside and I feel as if I’ve turned to stone. Each second is an eternity. I block out the sounds of her screeching in my head to try and remember what to do. 

Everything will be fine when I remember the rule, but fuck me I wish it would happen sooner.

1q4v3ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/comments/1q4v3ng/my_recovery_story/,My recovery story,"Sorry for the long post. Hope it’s worth the read. This is in response to a post about vestibular tests and I’m hoping this reaches a wider audience this way.

As far as we know, I fit the criteria for both vestibular migraines and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD). My understanding is that essentially my central nervous system mixes up the signals sent by the eye, inner ear, and other sense organs. So while my inner ear functions normally, my brain is confusing the signals and telling me I’m moving when I’m not. 

I had relentless ear infections as a child and one day became extremely dizzy when I was 9 years old. I grew up with nystagmus, a constant feeling of being on a boat and or a feeing of being pulled to the right (which has wrecked my posture and I am trying to fix with pilates, yoga, and strength training). I would get “drop attacks” where I felt like a sudden jolt of falling through the floor (those were the worst in school very embarrassing and scary). I struggled to fall asleep I was so dizzy for years. As a kid there were many times I would sleep sitting up with my glasses on and the lights on. (I now purposely walk around without glasses in the AM, sleep in the dark, lay flat, and regularly roll both ways when I’m changing positions or get up in the morning). I was terrified of riding the bus, certain (actually most) classrooms, and I often sat in the nurses office during gym class or pep rallies. It significantly disrupted my social life, grades, and mental health. It was torment probably about 80% of my waking time and I was very suicidal because of it from about 11-20. 

My small town physicians (and my poor parents) did not know what to do with me. I went to ENT, neurology, three different dizziness specialists and two vestibular rehab therapists. (One sucked the other was amazing and helped me understand what was happening and how we could fix it. She often had interns come work with me and said I was a once in a life time case that should be studied lol.) I did drive (not sure why I was allowed to) and I struggled with that off and on whether I was a driver or passenger. Being dizzy and off balance and terrified infiltrated most of my youth and I let it rob me of many opportunities. I often wonder what life would have been like without it. It did keep me away from drugs (besides pot, but even then that made me dizzy sometimes so I hit terrified of even being around it) which was a huge problem in my friend group/hometown. 

I am now almost 27 years old (F) and I ride horses regularly (not well lol), I can drive long distances (regularly drive 6 hours two states away to see my partner without too much of a problem), I drink coffee (more than I probably should), I run on a treadmill, work 12+ hours a day on my feet as a vet tech, and many other things that were beyond my imagination. 

I had a fantastic vestibular therapist as a teenager and the exercises were absolute torment but it did help. Essentially she made me incredibly dizzy (think spinning in a chair, standing on different things that moved, walking down a long hall turning my head every step, etc it was a nightmare) and then while I was recovering (we had to push it to the point of me feeling like I was gonna lose consciousness it was so bad) quizzed me on random things to try to coordinate my brain and vestibular system. It was brutal but it helped significantly. I imagine if I still did the exercises I could make even more of a recovery and maybe even be competitive in horse riding (I still tend to lose my balance more easily than the average rider). 

I struggled with the migraine aspect pretty severely during puberty and in my early 20s, but managing stress and staying very active has helped (thank you vet med and horse riding/barn chores/poverty forcing me to work multiple jobs to survive sometimes). 

I am now off of all medications (I did topiramate for 7 years (the brain fog was awful) and lamotrigine for about 3 years (it wasn’t bad but I was determined to try being med free)) and if I eat well (doesn’t have to be perfect), sleep well, stay active/hydrated I have maybe 1 episode a month (which I use similar anxiety strategies described below to get through it especially if I am busy and can’t go sleep in a quiet room). Sugar, processed foods, and alcohol (I get wicked hangovers now, usually 1-3 days so I drink rarely and try to drink little if I do. Smoking even a small amount of weed makes me feel like I’m falling through the floor so unfortunately I do not partake) are my main migraine triggers now. I think my age may have helped as well. A couple of my specialists over the years told me if I ever got pregnant or when I hit menopause my migraines would likely disappear (due to hormone change) but as I’ve gotten older they have reduced in frequency. I think a lot of it has to do with anxiety/stress management and staying active. 

For my PPPD, I believe now the biggest help the past few years has been eliminating anxiety when I feel dizzy or even just “off”. I used to hold onto walls, close my eyes, lean a certain way etc and naturally panic when it got bad. Now, similar to my vestibular rehab, I do the opposite. I sit with it. I do not try to compensate in anyway. I try to relax my neck shoulders, etc, and feel the spinning, swaying, drifting sensation, jumpy vision, etc. and most importantly let go of any mental or physical tension. Sometimes it can take 15 minutes. Sometimes it’s 5-10 seconds. I tell my body we are safe, this is just a silly mix up with my brain, it will end soon, and I am not scared or in danger here and that this feeling is truly no big deal. It has done wonders for my dizziness and mental health. (I have also gotten into doing energy work with horses and they can sense the slightest iota of any kind of mental tension. The practice to completely still my mind and body began from them as did my awareness of my bad posture and balance). I still purposely do things that challenge my dizziness several times a week. That could be bending side to side and doing head circles (to try to fix my crooked body from all the postural compensation but also challenge my dizziness), walking on a treadmill or stair stepper, or even just going to a place that normally makes me anxious about my dizziness like the grocery store or auditorium. 

A couple summers ago I went out on a boat for a company outing for the first time in probably a decade. It was very scary at first, but I ended up recovering just fine. I did drink alcohol in a desperate attempt to kind of slow down my anxiety and my CNS, and I was hungover for a day but it was worth it. I think if I could do it in small bursts several times a week I could do it totally sober eventually. We were out on the lake for three hours (with close coworkers who knew this was a big deal and kind of an experiment for me. That helped me feel safe enough to try it.) My next goals are to go in an elevator and hopefully one day fly in a plane! 

I think if this had not happened to me at such a young age where I was forced to continue staying active and going to school (especially later as an adult, I have to work to survive. I had no other option to feed myself and stay housed) I would have ended up on disability (which one of the dizzy specialists in Chicago recommended for me actually). 

I’d recommend practicing meditation and anxiety management techniques on good days/comfortable places and then slowly incorporate those strategies when doing things that purposefully are triggering. Its not comfortable and it usually gets worse before it gets better. But, you would be amazed how much control you have over your mind (and then in effect your body) even when you feel like you are spiraling out into space. I have practiced enough that now I can slow down and notice that if I let any anxiety in it is like dumping gasoline on the “dizziness” fire (again thank you horses for teaching me that you are only gonna get hurt when you think about getting hurt lol). 

I still have bad days and I’m even working on intermittent fmla to protect my job. I do still have to call in about once every 6 weeks or so because of it. If I worked a desk job or remotely I imagine that call offs would nearly be eliminated, but this job forces me to be active on my feet and that’s a good thing. I am not sure I could willingly push myself this hard if given the choice. 

When starting out make sure you are safe and not risking falling, operating a vehicle, etc. Eventually branching out to harder things, longer, in public spaces, etc. As always consult a doctor before changing your meds. None of this constitutes as medical advice and I am not a medical professional. Safety of yourself and others is always paramount. 

Sorry for the long answer I’m approaching 20 years of fighting this and I want to give some hope! Please feel free to ask any questions, I would love to help if I can! If there are other subreddits I could post this in that would give people hope I’d love to know as well. ",4,1767640658.0,VestibularMigraines,0,1.0,False

I stalled in month 3 didn’t lose anything. So after 4 weigh ins of the same weight I switched to eating strictly rice, chicken breast, eggs and broccoli. I’d weigh everything individually with a food scale. I also lowered my calorie intake to 1300. I do not use any oils only 0 cal cooking spray. I also don’t use sauces besides siracha and soy sauce. I stopped walking everyday and instead switched to lifting in the gym 3-4x a week with a mile walk on the treadmill after lifting.  I lost my next 10 pounds this way fairly consistently 2+ pounds a week.

Now I’ve stalled again. Two weigh ins ago I was 234 then the next week my period hit and I was 235, I expected to go up a little during this time. Wasn’t that worried. and now this weigh in I’m 237. I have changed nothing. I’m still eating 1300 calories of rice chicken broccoli and eggs same no oil and sauces as before. Still hitting the gym sessions. I actually even upped the intensity of my mile walk with incline. I’ve also had 24 hour fasts (1 a week) the last week and this week. I generally get 6-8+ hours of sleep and my water is a little low I average about 45-50oz a day but it’s been that way the whole time basically. 

I don’t struggle with hunger cravings that stopped on month 3. I don’t snack very often and if I do I always log it. I don’t consume liquid calories, I drink 1 cup of coffee with measured out creamer, 1 10 calorie energy drink, and the rest of my day is water. I don’t use oils to cook my foods. I really don’t think there’s hidden calories here that I’m not logging correctly. 

I’ve heard about starvation mode, but I feel like people are very split on it. Half think it’s real half think it’s bullshit. Even if it is real, at my size and my intake would it even be possible for it to stop weight loss? I prioritize protein and do weight lifting which is both supposed to help boost your metabolism and fight the slow down…  I don’t think I have anything medically that would prevent weight loss but I haven’t been screened or checked.(will be soon ish)

Has anyone else experienced this? What else can I try? My goal was to lose as close to 90lbd as I could in a year and I’m disheartened that I’m only 30lbs at this point. ",2,1767640613.0,WeightLossAdvice,3,1.0,False

He has A LOT. He does not like to go with my son anywhere because he’s difficult and a toddler.

He is a very good man, no one is perfect, recently I learnt a lot about him from his family and traumas/wounds from childhood, father basically escaped from the family \*slowly\*, he was always wanting his father more, mother did everything but was always angry, worked and took care of him and brothers. 

My 1st problem: After having a son, I realize how important it is to have a good husband and to be able to provide for your children so they can have the most opportunities and experiences from life.  I am very lucky in this department because my husband is a very good man and a good father.  However, what I am realizing, is that I want more from life, I want to travel, and to drive a nice car that I like, he always buys some cheap cars to save money, I KNOW. Its stupid to think the way I do, I cant help it!

The 2nd problem: My husband wants more children and he makes it clear we will have more \*boys\*, but, I feel like he does not have that much energy for them? Or patience…  Although he is getting better.

I am fully fully completely dependent on him financially. I worked before my son, but never made a lot, even though I got multiple \*worthless\* degrees, was just never lucky in work. We were both broke when we got together but he makes good money now. He makes good money now but its never stable and I have NO clue what he makes or how (in fintech) I am fully in baby mode, I feel like I have a mom brain 24/7 and have jello in my head. Sometimes Im even awkward socially because I lost my personality a bit.

My husband's life didn't really change, he still goes out for coffee with friends whenever he wants, meanwhile I feel guilty when I do it. We are the only ones taking care of our boy, we do not even have a babysitter for him. I have never been away from him for more than 2 hours. Meanwhile he goes on ""worktrips"" sometimes and gets a break and lots of ""me"" time. He encourages me to go out more but all I do is go to the gym everyday for an hour and that’s plenty of time for myself and I lost a lot of weight and look better than even before I had a baby. 

I feel like if we have another baby, I will just continue living my life the way I never wanted to.  Not travelling, not having more finances, never seeing my family (we moved to a different  continent). I cant really work here yet, because of the language barrier so I would need to do online work/studying in the beginning (which I will gladly do)

I love my son, but is it time to put him in daycare? Has any women been in a similar situation? 

How do I nicely tell my husband I want more from life (drive the car I want,  put my son in a specific daycare I like, etc.  before we have another kid?  My husband and I get along very well and have good communication but I notice I find it hard to communicate what I want bc of insecurities.

tl;dr      It seems like my husband makes all the decisions and I am just a baby caretaker.  How do I stand up for myself before having another baby to make sure I don’t resent my husband down the road\\\\\\? ",0,1767640509.0,marriageadvice,11,0.25,False

1q4v0kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1q4v0kw/the_detox_lie_exposed_the_one_morning_drink_that/,The Detox Lie Exposed: The One Morning Drink That Actually Works.,"Every time I scroll TikTok, I see someone swearing their skin cleared, bloat disappeared, and life changed forever after drinking “this ONE simple thing” on an empty stomach. Lemon water. Apple cider vinegar. Celery juice. Pink Himalayan salt in warm water. Some even go as far as recommending baking soda cocktails. It’s everywhere.

But most of it? Not backed by real science. Just influencers chasing virality with pretty glass jars and aesthetic kitchen vibes.

This post is for anyone who's been overwhelmed by all this wellness noise. What actually works, and why? After digging through legit sources (peer-reviewed research, expert panels, and functional medicine science), here’s what to actually pay attention to if you want a real morning *reset* — and what to ignore.

The goal isn’t quick-fix detox culture. It’s consistent habits based on how your body *actually* works.

---

*Let’s break it down: what to drink on an empty stomach (and what not to).*

- **✅ *Filtered water with minerals or electrolytes (not plain tap water) first thing in the morning***
  - After 7–9 hours of sleep, your body wakes up dehydrated. You literally lose water through your breath overnight.
  - According to the CDC, even mild dehydration impairs cognitive function, mood, and digestion. You’ll feel clearer almost instantly when rehydrated.
  - *But here’s the key:* Plain water sometimes flushes out electrolytes, especially if you drink it in large amounts. The World Health Organization recommends adding trace minerals (like magnesium, sodium, and potassium) to your water if you’re doing it first thing. You can get this from a pinch of sea salt or trace mineral drops.
  - Dr. Andrew Huberman explains on his Huberman Lab podcast that adding electrolytes in the morning helps activate the adrenal system and support cortisol rhythms — which is what gives you energy naturally, with no caffeine required.

- **✅ *1 small cup of warm water + lemon (with pulp, not juice-only)***
  - Not for “fat burning” or some magical pH effect — that’s a myth. But lemon pulp contains pectin and flavonoids, which support gut motility and help prep your digestion before eating.
  - According to a 2018 review in *Nutrients*, citrus flavonoids can support liver enzyme activity and reduce inflammatory markers — but only as part of a consistent habit, not a miracle cure.
  - Just avoid it if you have acid reflux, and rinse after to protect your teeth enamel.

- **✅ *Green tea or matcha (not coffee) if your cortisol is dysregulated***
  - If you’ve been waking up wired but tired, or crashing mid-morning, it could be tied to your cortisol pattern.
  - A 2021 review in *Frontiers in Nutrition* found that green tea polyphenols (especially EGCG) reduce oxidative stress and may help regulate blood sugar and cortisol spikes.
  - Matcha is especially helpful because it contains L-theanine, which balances the caffeine and reduces the jitters.
  - Skip coffee for the first hour after waking — Dr. Rangan Chatterjee and other longevity experts agree that delaying caffeine gives your natural cortisol levels time to rise without interference.

---

*What you can skip:*

- **❌ *Apple cider vinegar “shots” straight up***  
  - TikTok loves it. Your enamel and gut lining don't.
  - Clinical trials from the *Journal of Functional Foods* in 2019 show mild blood glucose improvements from ACV when taken with meals — not on an empty stomach.
  - If you use it, dilute a teaspoon in water and drink it slowly *with* food, not before.

- **❌ *Celery juice obsession***  
  - There’s zero evidence it “detoxes” you. Celery is great — but there’s nothing magical about juicing it solo.
  - The claims stem mostly from anecdotal content via the Medical Medium which, heads up, is not medically trained.
  - A 2020 analysis in *Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition* showed that while celery has phenolic compounds, whole celery in meals is just as beneficial (and more sustainable) than expensive juice habits.

- **❌ *Baking soda water for alkalinity***  
  - Please don’t. It can mess with your stomach acid and has been linked to increased risk of metabolic alkalosis if overused.
  - Your body regulates blood pH tightly — you can’t change it meaningfully through food or drinks. That’s just basic biology.

---

*Bonus tips to level up your morning habit stack:*

- **Add a small pinch of magnesium glycinate or trace minerals to your water**
  - Helps with muscle recovery, mental focus, and hydration
- **Try mouth-taping at night to keep nasal breathing (reduces dehydration and fatigue)**
  - Big in biohacking circles, with support from Dr. James Nestor in *Breath*
- **Don't just hydrate — move**
  - A 3–5 minute stretch or walk after your drink gets your lymphatic system moving, which *does* help your natural detox systems work better

---

The reality? Your liver and kidneys are already detox experts. You just need to support them with simple, smart habits — not marketing gimmicks.

I’m a Flair 3 Pro user based in **Europe (Belgium)** and I’m trying to find the **perfect coffee scale** for my setup.

My requirements are simple:

* **Accuracy 0.01g**
* **Built-in timer** (or stopwatch that’s easy to use)
* Preferably **< \~10cm width** so it fits nicely near/under the Flair drip tray

I’ve been looking around but haven’t found many compact scales that fit all of this. I’ve seen a lot of talk about the **Weightman**, but in Europe it’s around **85€**, which feels expensive for a scale — though I totally understand the appeal if it’s worth it.

So I’d love to hear from the community:  
👉 **What scale do you use for your Flair setup?**  
👉 **Do you have recommendations available in Europe?**  
👉 Any honest pros/cons of your scale? (especially compact ones)

Bonus: Any other small tools/accessories you find **really useful** with a Flair (e.g. tampers, distributors, etc.) would be great to know too!

Also happy to hear if anyone in **Belgium** has direct experience!

Thanks in advance! ☕️💛

Salut tout le monde ! 😊

Je suis utilisateur d’une **Flair 3 Pro** basé en **Europe (Belgique)** et je cherche **la balance idéale** pour mon setup.

Voici mes besoins :

* **Précision 0,01 g**
* **Minuteur / chrono intégré**
* **Largeur < \~10 cm** si possible, pour qu’elle rentre bien autour / sous le bac de gouttes de ma Flair

J’ai cherché pas mal, mais j’ai du mal à trouver quelque chose qui coche toutes ces cases. J’ai vu beaucoup parler de la **Weightman**, mais en Europe elle est autour de **85 €**, ce qui me paraît cher pour une balance — même si je comprends que ça puisse être justifié si la qualité est là.

👉 **Quelle balance utilisez-vous pour votre Flair ?**  
👉 **Des recommandations disponibles en Europe ?**  
👉 Des avis honnêtes sur vos balances ? (spécialement les modèles compacts)

And also say upfront be honest with your feedback. My questions have nothing to do with shamming plus size people, but to get me to tune into my feeling and concerns. For me someone’s weight can go up and down, and I know my weight has been up and down. I know right now its getting better and going down, but it has been up there 309 lb. Right now, I am 260 lb. I can ride my mountain bike, workout at the gym, fast walk around the lakes etc. I don’t have any mobility issues; knock on wood I am grateful I don’t. Stuff happens in life where some people do run into mobility issues due to weigh or other health issues. Everyone deserves to be accepted and loved regardless of weight, mobility. So let me flip the script and if I was the plus size man, and who says I am not I could be to some people, society had put that unfortunately visual stigma on us. But let’s say it’s me at 309lb. I know I have a lot to give, and offer in a relationship, and accept me for me.

I met someone online, gorgeous pictures, she shares pictures from herself back in the day. Currently this person is in her 60’s and so am I in my 60’s. We had our first coffee date, and there I discovered she was plus size, with a slight limp. I asked her about the limp and she needs a knee replacement. Well, that’s par of the course as some people age, it happens. Not an issue. I genuinely like this lady, she has the values I am looking for, and is on the same page I am on with my journey. Plus, she has the most beautiful face, I would say she is Fine!

 

We will be having a second date and hanging out coming up this next weekend.

 

Honestly, I don’t have a point, I have concerns. Knee replacement, mobility, active life style and at this late stage in our life could be a hurdle. We are compatible on so many things, but taking into consideration weigh and mobility is that really something I should be having a conversation with her about? Would these concerns be rude for me to even ask on our second date?",0,1767640248.0,dating_advice,9,0.5,False

1q4uvc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1q4uvc5/mil_constantly_puts_me_on_the_spot/,MIL constantly puts me on the spot,"My MIL heavily operates on a “the worst they can say is no” strategy with everyone in her life. This trait isn’t always negative, but often results in her being incredibly rude and inconsiderate. I am a recovering “people pleaser” and love my MIL very much, but I am getting burnt out from her asking me if it’s okay if she does something rather than her realizing it’s rude to ask in the first place. She is well known for this trait. Even worse, she will sometimes do something first, and then ask me if it’s okay while it’s happening. It forces me to have to say “no” or feel like I can’t. She lacks social awareness and a baseline of respect about how people will feel if she asks in the first place. 

My MIL has an apartment on our third floor (we are inheriting her house and currently live there. She has given us so much and I’m so grateful, which adds to my feeling like I can’t speak up). I’ve been struggling to make this space truly mine, because she hasn’t prioritized building a separate entrance to her floor like she promised (it is in the budget). As a result, she has to walk through our space on the first and second floors to get to her apartment on the third floor. I’ve adapted to this, though it’s been difficult for me in many ways. She doesn’t take her outside shoes/ boots off when she walks through my space (right now it’s snowy where I live too, making it even messier). I am a strict “no outside shoes in the house” gal for many reasons. My husband is going to ask her to stop, but why can’t she realize this is an obvious form of disrespect? There’s a lack of communication on my part about the rules because I feel like she’s done a lot for me and who am I to ask her to change her ways after she has had this house for 20 years? As close as her and I have become, her not thinking “it’s their space, better take off my boots” baffles and devastates me. It’s that deep for me. I don’t expect her to read my mind, but I’m certain we all know people in our lives who do socially unacceptable things that leave us confused.

I gave her permission to bring someone over this morning into our kitchen to drop something off (I work from home and my office is in the dining room so any activity during the day is disruptive). There was no miscommunication about this quick visit. That quick visit turned into “would you like some coffee?” At my kitchen table. And then another person showed up. This lasted half an hour, she thanked me, then went up to her space. 

However, two hours later, without asking, she brought ANOTHER family friend over into my kitchen to chat at the kitchen table. Again, I work from home and this was very disruptive. Fifteen minutes into them talking she asks me “is it okay that we’re talking here?” This put me on the spot and in front of a guest I had to awkwardly say “I guess it’s okay.” In a very annoyed tone. She got the hint and they went up to her space to chat instead. I’m so mad at myself for not saying what I actually wanted to say. Just because I let something happen one time, she thinks it’s okay to continue as if it’s a lifetime pass. I’ve asked her in the past to treat this space like my office during my work hours. I want to cherish and respect this space without giving up my agency and dignity. 

She is not malicious, and in her heart she is a loving and emotional person, but she is incredibly inconsiderate and controlling and does not truly respect me if she can’t stop being imposing and rude. My husband has repeatedly confronted her about this, to the point where they have yelled at each other. I even had a huge fight with her last summer. I’m lucky to have a protective husband, but this house just ain’t a home. And I feel like a failure for not being able to stand up for myself in the moment anymore. I just want to feel respected and at peace and have privacy.

* We finetuned prompts and pushed an update a few weeks ago that improved the memory context. In these coming weeks, we'll be working on bug fixes and improving the single player experience on Status since that's what the majority of users care about. Most major bugs are fixed at the moment, we understand that there are issues with repetitiveness that we're looking into as well. 
* **If you are experiencing issues with Status not loading (posts not loading, dms not loading), you likely do not have notifications on. Make sure you go to your phone's settings and make sure that notifications are on. Status only works if your notifications are on. Don't worry, we won't send notifications to your phone if you are not using the app.** The reason why Status now needs notifs on to work is because Apple changed the way silent notifications are delivered. We're planning on replacing this requirement, but it's big infra change and will take some time. 
* Also, if you ever purchase a subscription or coffee and it for some reason doesn't load or end up in your inventory, please ask for a refund from Apple/Google - this is a bug affecting a 1% of users right now, and we're looking into it! 
* You'll be able to find announcements on new updates within the Status app, and we'll continue to post on Discord/Reddit so you know what we're working on.

By the end of this, you’ll see why letting go feels like losing your identity — and how staying in this loop quietly costs you years without realizing it.  It starts in those first quiet moments, alone in your apartment, when the absence hits like a wave you didn’t see coming.
You tell yourself it’s just temporary, but deep down, there’s this pull, this unspoken dread that without them, you’re somehow less.
That silent pain: the fear that this person was your last shot at feeling truly alive, and moving on means admitting you bet everything on the wrong hand.
It’s not something you voice at brunch with friends in Toronto or over coffee in Chicago — it’s the ache that lingers when the lights go out.  You replay those late-night talks, the way they looked at you, not because you want the pain, but because it’s familiar in a world that feels suddenly foreign.
Pause for a second — this isn’t weakness; it’s your brain’s way of holding on to what once felt safe.
In the glow of your phone screen at 2 AM, you hover over their name, knowing one tap could reignite the spark or shatter the illusion.
That’s the entry point, where attachment recycling begins — not as a choice, but as an automatic response to the void.
But here’s the uncomfortable part nobody tells you: this pattern doesn’t just happen; it’s wired into you from years of seeking connection in a disconnected age.
Think about your last scroll through Instagram — exes popping up in stories, mutual friends tagging them — it’s designed to keep you hooked, turning heartbreak healing into a daily battle.
You convince yourself it’s harmless, just checking in, but each glance reinforces the cycle, making post-breakup recovery feel impossible.  This is only the beginning.
The deeper layers — intermittent reinforcement, how it reshapes your identity, and the precise way to break the loop — are in the full video.

Went into a caloric deficit, worked out 3-4 times a week, and the weight on the scale wouldn’t budge. I was constantly inflamed and lethargic despite being active and eating healthy/drinking water. I felt hopeless — I would lose 3lbs in a month despite my best efforts (managed to stick with it and lost 7lbs). It just felt like my body just wanted to hold onto all the fat it could. I decided to go on Tirzepatide this past Nov after 2 years of trying it the natural way. 

It was the best decision I made — I feel like my normal self again and not just by the number on the scale. I’m less inflamed, I can enjoy food without overindulging, my PMS symptoms are less intense, and I don’t have brain fog/feel lethargic. I also fit into all my old clothes 🥹 I’ve managed to keep my muscle by focusing on protein and putting electrolytes in my water has helped me overall especially when I first started.

Developed gastritis in September 2025 with symptoms of severe nausea, burning pain in my stomach, couldn't eat anything without significant flare up in symptoms.  I was literally bed ridden and completely exhausted.  Felt I would never feel normal again. Had my gallbladder removed end of Sept, which didn't really help with my symptoms but it needed to be removed for its own reasons.  I did end up needing to take cholestyramine for about 1.5 months post op to help with bile in my stools.  That has since resolved and I no longer need to take it. 

I went on 40 mg of panto x 2 times/day and 25mg Amitriptyline at bedtime.  Started that mid October.  I started to feel some relief within a few days, but continued with very bland diet for about a month to mid November.  I was starting to feel really improved and slowly introduced all foods back. 

I can now eat whatever I want for the most part.  I am drinking coffee again.  I am slowly weaning off panto, and down to 1/day in the am.  Hoping to cut that in half in a few weeks and slowly get off it altogether.  I still have some days where my stomach will burn a little or I will have some nausea, but I just don't have coffee that day, or eat bland foods for a day or 2 and it settles out.

In the beginning of my diagnosis, I felt so incredibly lost and honestly the sickest I've ever felt.  This group was really helpful for me, and its the reason I tried amitriptyline, which I think was a big factor in my recovery.  I just wanted to say thank you for all the people who post, and I wanted to post a positive outcome as encouragement for those still fighting this.  I know I am lucky to be recovering so quickly, but there is hope for others that you can find resolution with this battle.  ",3,1767639635.0,Gastritis,5,1.0,False

1q4ukmd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4ukmd,I think my baby is near the end.,"He developed stomatitis around October and it hit hard. Steroids didn’t work, antibiotics didn’t work, and the partial mouth extraction didn’t work either. In fact, I really believe the surgery kills his spirit

I got it done on Dec 22 2025 and he has not been the same.

His eyes are just so different, like he’s tired. I know I can get more surgery to remove all of it, but I don’t think he can mentally survive more. He’s also not physically strong enough.

He’s barely eating and last night I found him sleeping in his own poop. 

I think it’s time.

His story: (it’s a bit long)

His name is Marcellus, nickname “Welly Belly.”

I was 19 years old when my roommates said they found a kitten next to the train tracks. 

For the first time in my life, I wanted an animal so badly. I’m not the type to pick up strays or get attached to strays, but I instantly wanted this one.

We had a rough first year together. We lived with a hoarder and an emotionally abusive person. I left the day things got physical and packed up over night. I grabbed all that I could and begged my dad to let me take my baby with me. Not long after that we ended up moving somewhere else.

I ended up loosing Welly Belly during that move. He was lost for 2 years. I went back to that area once a week for the first year, and every so often the second year. Not a day went by where I didn’t bawl my eyes out praying for him to come home. I even found his collar at one point, but I could never find him. 

I couldn’t find him, and I had assumed the worst. 

On June 21, 2019 I received a text. “We found your pet, please text home if untied, or call this number below” It was 8:40am and I was on the bus heading to work. I dialed the number and a vet was on the phone. She let me know some sweet older lady had found my cat crying around the streets not too far from where I lost him. She took him in and said he was the sweetest boy she ever met. The vet scanned for microchips and that’s when I got the text. 

I was so stunned. I let the vet know I didn’t have a car so I needed to plan a pick up time, but the kind woman who found him offered to drop him off at my place. So I went to work and counted the minutes till I can get home. 

As soon as I got to my apartment and walked in the door, I had a full on meltdown. I felt so many emotions at once. Relieved my baby was alive. Scared because I couldn’t afford a pet, but also happy that he was coming home. 

A few hours later, the nice lady brought him home. She got him all his shots for me and was happy to reunite us.

That first month we were inseparable. He refused to leave my side and I couldn’t stop staring at him. “This is real, he’s home.”

He actually got very fat when during the first few months. He wouldn’t stop eating, I assume because he was starving on the streets. At one point he was 21 pounds before the vet said he needed to loose weight. I got him down to a healthy 15 pounds, he’s a big cat so for him this was normal. 

My baby has 1 sister and 2 brothers now. He loves to bully his sister, and has bonded with the brothers.

He would listen to me play banjo and meow along, like he was singing or complaining. I like to believe singing because one time I was playing, he jumped on my lap and starting meowing a long. 

He is my work from home buddy, always laying on my lap while I work. Hissing when I want to get up. In fact he did that a lot when we were cuddling. Like he was saying “how dare you interrupt my nap.” I always let him win, and he’d snore the day away while my arms or legs went numb.

Prior to the stomatitis, he was also very food motivated. I’d catch him stealing my food if I dared to walk away from it. One time I left sushi on the coffee table and came back to half of it gone. Ofc it was him, it’s always him.

I’ve had this cat since I was 19, and I’m 30 now. Even though it’s only been 11 years, I feel like he’s been here forever. 

He’s been with me through so many life stages that it’s hard to imagine he won’t be there for my 40s. But I think my baby is telling me it’s time.",6,1767639548.0,cats,1,0.81,False

If you feel at all resistant to re-framing I would skip this post. I am experiencing poverty but the only mouths to feed are my cat and dog who are thriving - frankly. I've stockpiled for them when I knew the wheels might come off last year, I'm home more and the dog gets snowy walks instead of boring car rides. 

Like so many of us at the kill line, there was a perfect storm in August; a breakup, a car too expensive to fix, illness. I’ve been making ends meet creatively and ventured to the food bank once - it’s across town and I’ve just got a backpack, but that trip in October becomes relevant as you'll see. I’ve applied for support but haven’t heard back, yet. I’ve got a doctor’s appointment tomorrow to apply for a tax credit to pay for medication, a form that very ironically costs 150$ - almost the monthly value of the credit - to complete. It would help enormously and I have hope it'll come to fruition, even if it’s months from now. 

I’ve worked both as a volunteer and professionally in community services so I recognize many of the faces I interact with as now a case/participant instead of, say, helping fundraise for community gardens. That has been a growing opportunity, embarrassing yes but I’m having to just exist in the world exactly as I am and it's like a growth exercise. Another upside is that I know what resources are available locally. 

This weekend I spent my time awake chugging along on applications and projects that could provide income at some point. I have internet for now.  It was easy to focus because there’s officially zero food left. Another way the world is conspiring for me? I’m a pretty experienced faster. The fact I’m not currently doing it to try and manage pain is a blessing. I know all this extra free time from cooking, shopping and cleaning gives me more energy to direct towards finding the next opportunity. I’m not eating for pleasure, I’m not having endless coffee. If I were pressed, I could reasonably pass this off as a New Year's related lifestyle change. How's that for timing?

I’ve been having miso soup using the last of the kale and frozen garden bits for a couple weeks, with the odd discounted protein or ramen pack. Over the weekend we've dwindled down to just broth, teas, I have an ancient bag of greens powder I discovered in the back of the cupboard as it emptied. Yesterday I fished out the last of the tofu chunks but at 11pm I couldn’t sleep. 

I drank a grey/green juice and brought the miso broth up on low heat. The last item from the food bank was frozen methi thepla I broke up and stirred in. That’s when it hit me. 

I was making gruel. 

A surprisingly culinarily adventurous gruel! With home grown kale stalks and tomatoes I rescued from the compost pile, blanched and stashed away. I had a green juice! In a different context this meal could be considered almost snobby. The flatbread mostly dissolved as I hoped and was delicious but the chunks that didn’t break down were …challenging, as texture goes. Also? Hot slop CLINGS like porridge more than a sip of tea, so I also burned the absolute shit out of my mouth because I was so impatient to eat it. Another lesson learned! Look at all this personal development! 

I got a lot done, I'm probably getting a bit leaner, the animals are okay and I have change to do one more load of laundry. I now have a clean fridge and cupboard. I know it can be so invalidating to be forced to reframe truly horrendous situations, but I’m not sure I’m in one. I don’t know what’s coming next, but I do feel uncharacteristically zen - I feel more calm than I was at the end of the summer when I still had things to lose. And at every turn it’s like I’ve been preparing for this moment my whole life.

To kick off the new year, I wanted to reshare this post because OCI bid list deadlines are starting to come up for the early schools who have their OCI's in \*checks watch\* well I guess right bleepin' now.

# Hopefully this will help answer the question ""how the frick does OCI bidding work?""

For context: While students are increasingly getting firm offers during [pre-OCI](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1irueip/preoci_explained_for_those_of_you_prepping_for/) (meaning direct applying), many others still get their offers through On-Campus Interviews (OCI); consider it your second shot at the apple these days.

Here, it becomes crucial to structure your bids *strategically* so that you can maximize your chances of landing a summer associate position at a big law firm; this is because you usually only have a limited number of bids (i.e. 30), versus directly applying, when you can just blanket the entire AmLaw 200 if you wanted. 

# With that in mind, here are the biggest data points you should be balancing when building your bid list.

# 1. Understand your school's OCI bidding system

Law schools typically use a lottery, preselect, matching system, or student choice system for OCI (they might go by different names, but this is the gist). Here's a brief overview of each:

* **Lottery System**: Firms are assigned to students randomly, ensuring everyone gets a fair chance at interviews. However, your chances of getting an interview with a top firm might be lower due to the randomness.
* **Preselect System**: Firms review student applications in advance and select who they want to interview. This system often favors students with higher GPAs and relevant experience.
* **Matching System**: This combines elements of both lottery and preselect, balancing student preferences with firm selections.
* **Student Choice:** This is where students who rank a firm highly on their list are essentially guaranteed an interview with the firm. While this is a great opportunity to get to talk to the firm of your choice, make sure you don't target a firm you are not in the GPA range for (more on that below), since it will kind of be a waste of a bid since they might not be willing to hire you because of your GPA anyways.

It's critical you understand your school's system because it changes how to arrange your bid list. For example, if the first 10 of your bids are student choice, and the next 20 are preselect, you'll want to be strategic about which firms you list as your first 10 because they're your strongest bullets to get an interview.

But, something to consider, if a firm almost never takes students from your school and you are significantly below their GPA range, you're guaranteeing an interview that will be extremely unlikely to turn into a callback or job offer.

**So order of your bid list matters.**

# 2. Use historical GPA data

***Ask your law school's career services office for historical GPA data on firms that recruit from your school.***

Your career services office almost certainly keeps track of everything related to OCI hiring.

Specifically, they should have:

**1) a database listing** ***every single firm*** **that hires from your school, and the GPA ranges of the people given offers, including the high, low, and median numbers.**

**2) a database where they collect the number of people who applied, the number of people who are given screeners, the number given callbacks, offers, and how many took those offers.**

Though they may be obstinate about sharing this data with you (we've seen schools outright say they don't have it, can't share it because of legal liability, say they don't know what students are talking about, etc.), but this would be something we *highly highly highly* recommend asking them for.

If OCS say no:

1. You can check in on the [tracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1jsztlb/the_big_law_offer_and_timeline_tracker_a_database/) pinned to the sub to see other students from the same/similar schools with the same/similar GPA's at all the same firms instead. It's a much smaller data pool but it should give you something to work with if your OCS is unhelpful.
2. Make sure you bother OCS anyways. This is the time to advocate for yourself and investigate further (of course, if they don't give it to you, then they don't give it to you and you have to do a little reverse engineering to figure it out, but it's worth the ask).

The career counselors objectively know this information and should be using it to help you structure your bid lists, and in that case, you should arguably be allowed access to it to make an informed decision.

This information is objectively ***the most helpful*** when it comes to determining which firms you should target and categorize as safety, target, or reach.

# Once you have this data, it’s essential to be realistic about your GPA.

Just like when you were applying to law school, use the following strategy to portion out which firms should make up which parts of your bid list:

* **Some Safety Firms**: Firms where your GPA is above their typical range.
* **Mostly Target Firms**: Firms where your GPA is within their typical range.
* **Some Reach Firms**: Firms where your GPA is below their typical range but you have other strong qualifications or a compelling story that might make up for it (something like Law Review, you're applying to a diversity summer position because you are diverse, you have especially strong networks there, etc).

# 3. Filter by firm location and firm size

You can use Vault to see the office locations of each firm. Make sure your list includes firms with offices in the city your school targets or, if your school only targets small markets, make sure you include major markets like NYC or other where you are open to working. Larger markets mean it's just plain likely the firm will offer more summer associate positions, i.e., a New York office might take upwards of 60 or more summers, whereas a San Francisco office might take 6.

If you need help finding this, this data is also collected on the [application tracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1jsztlb/the_big_law_offer_and_timeline_tracker_a_database/) in one place if you need it (with a ""compare firms"" button that puts it all side by side).

You can also find this data on firms through the [National Association for Law Placement (NALP) directory](https://www.nalpdirectory.com/), Vault, Chambers, [Law.com](http://law.com/), and a series of other sites that have the data sort of scattered around. It takes some digging but it's there.

You of course don't need to go to a firm with a large class if you don't want to, but larger programs typically offer more opportunities in terms of trying out different practice areas and a greater likelihood of receiving a summer, and therefore, full-time offer since there are more offers available to give.

# 4. Balance The Rankings: Reputation, Revenue, and Practice Group

While Vault certainly gets the most attention, don't just look at the Vault ranking and say ""ah yes, this is the best firm for me because it is high in the Vault rankings."" Be thoughtful about what the rankings are *actually* telling you.

* [**Vault**](https://vault.com/) **Rankings**: This rank is about general firm reputation. It doesn't speak to the quality, size, or capability of particular practice groups you might be interested in. For example, if you want to do corporate work, you shouldn't be applying to Quinn Emmanuel just because it is high on the Vault rankings because *they don't do corporate work,* they're a litigation only shop. So while Vault can be a great starting point to gauge the reputation of a firm, it shouldn't be your only deciding data point.
* [**AmLaw 200**](https://www.law.com/law-firms/) **Rankings**: This list ranks firms by revenue, indicating general financial health, stability, and possibly resources that will therefore get invested into the summer program.
* [**Chambers**](https://chambers.com/) **Rankings**: ***This is arguably one of the most important things to research.*** **Chambers ranks** ***practice areas*** (in addition to attorneys individually), on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the best. If you have any indication of what practice area you may want to pursue, *check Chambers*. It will help you compare between firms based on that practice group specifically, with higher ranked practice areas being usually the larger and more sophisticated practice groups that might make up the bread and butter of the firm, i.e., it's not going to be fun if you try to apply to a firm and say you are dying to practice Maritime Law, but they only have 2 guys that do it; in that case, you probably are not going to get the chance to do much of that work and it might not be the right firm for you.

# 5. Bid the firms you have a network at, or if you don't have a network and you want to apply, network before you get there

First, there are a series of networking posts on the sub if you search networking, and remember that there is a wiki pinned to the right side of the sub with a series of guides about this and more.

Second, remember that the stronger your network at the firm, the more you'll be able to lean on it through this process. Ideally you'll be able to have at least one person (or ideally at least a couple people), who you've talked to about your practice areas of interest. This is because:

* you'll want to name drop them in your resume to show you did your due diligence on the firm before applying (this wins points when HR/Legal Recruiters scan your cover letter and decide whether you should get a screener)
* you'll want to name drop them in the interviews for this same reason

So when you have your final list of firms you want to bid on, we recommend immediately taking the time to make sure you have at least one person at each firm you can use as a conversational talking point to say, ""look, I went above and beyond the next applicant to make sure I talked to the firm's people and I understood the firms culture."" Of course, this isn't what guarantees an offer by any means, but it certainly makes for an application that is that much stronger.

Ultimately, preparing for OCI can be overwhelming, but with a well-thought out strategy and the right resources, you can substantially increase your chances of getting screeners, callbacks, and offers out of a complicated and exhausting system.

# Now, let’s talk some OCI math and how to play this game.

You’ve probably heard people say stuff like “you’ll be fine if you get X number of screeners,” or “Y number is the safe zone.” So what’s the truth?

# ✅ What’s a Good Number of Screeners?

Well there is no hard cutoff. The real answer is that a good number of screeners is the number that gets you at least one offer.

But I (just personally, this is just an opinion) think that a **very solid conversion rate** looks like about **a third or more of your bids turn into screeners** (whether they be lottery or preselect).

So for example, if you got something like **9 screeners out of \~30 bids,** I would think that's totally okay.

\*\*Caveat here to say that there are plenty of people who would reasonably disagree with this number, and that's okay. That's just what I find is around a good number, assuming you used up all your bids and bid reasonably within your GPA margins, for hopefully a positive result at the end. More than that is amazing, less than that is also okay, but if for example I bid at 30 firms and you only get 1 screener, I might think there might be an issue with my application, maybe a really rough GPA, targeting super small or hyper competitive markets only, etc--basically something would lead me to think that that number feels really low, and it's worth trying to troubleshoot to see what happened. 

If you land around that 1/3 ish number, you’re probably in a strong place — especially if your GPA is competitive and you’ve done at least some prep. Obviously, more screeners = more shots on goal, but working with a sizable number and having quality applications still matters.

# 🧠 So How Do You Stand Out in OCI Screeners?

Well first, make sure you're prepared generally. You can see guides on the wiki pinned to the right side of the sub on [how to prepare for a big law screener interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1gu7vnl/how_to_prepare_for_big_law_screener_interviews_a/) and a [callback interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1hmq8ry/i_have_a_callback_what_do_i_do_now_a_1l_and_2l/).

**But if you can. Network. It's the one lever you can pull after your school and GPA are set in stone.**

I recommend talking to at least **one attorney at each firm** you’re bidding/got a screener from. It can be a short Zoom, coffee, quick call, whatever — but I recommend it (again, there are guides on the wiki and in the pinned Welcome post on the sub).

Why?

# Because one of the most common OCI questions is:

“So… why this firm?”

If your answer is generic, then it becomes really hard to stand out against every other applicant who bid on that firm and is interviewing.

But if your answer references someone you spoke to, what you learned, and how it aligns with your goals — suddenly you're a bit more memorable. You seem **engaged**, thoughtful, and not like you’re mass applying (even though, yes, we all are and they know that).

# Real Talk: This Is a Numbers Game

OCI is chaotic. Everyone’s playing the odds. But your job is to:

* Play the numbers with intention (and bid appropriately, more details on [How To Make An OCI Bid List for Big Law](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1kapkwj/how_to_make_an_oci_bid_list_for_big_law_tactical/))
* Make every screener count by prepping as best you can
* Show firms you’re not just applying blindly — you’re genuinely interested

Because when it comes time to cut that screener list down to callbacks, they *will* prioritize people who’ve shown interest, done the work, and didn’t phone it in.

# TLDR:

* 1/3 or so conversion of your bids? I'd personally consider that a solid start. I.e. \~10/30.
* There’s no true “safe zone” — the more, the better.
* Networking is how you can tip the odds in your favor now that school and GPA are set.

# And don't forget!

**Just because OCI is happening, doesn't mean you can't still direct apply.** If there is a firm that didn't make it on your bid list for whatever reason, you can still direct apply to shoot your shot!

I find that my brain works really well with parametric design programs - programs where you draw a line/shape, and ***then*** assign it a fixed dimension, and locate other features with reference measurements and assigned dimensions. If i need to draw a rectangle in solidworks, i choose the start point, draw a rectangle of random shape and size, then assign it the dimensions I actually want with the dimension tool. I know there are more efficient ways of doing this, but this approach feels extremely intuitive to me, and matches how I think.

I find non-parametric programs like Shetchup, or Blender, or Fusion360, where you 'push and pull' surfaces, and work in undefined measurements, very un-intuitive for me. 

I know that you ***can*** still assign dimensions in Sketchup, by typing a value while you have a line being drawn, but these measurements are not fixed, and you have to START drawing something, then let go of the mouse without moving it too much, so that it's still aligning in the direction you want the measurement to apply to, before typing it in, and hitting enter. 

Solidworks, on the other hand, is very intuitive to me, but it's too complex, and too rigorous with wanting full definition on every line and measurement and coordinate space. If I were designing engine parts, that would all matter, but when I'm just sketching out a simple coffee table, it's frustrating overkill, and I'm getting conflict and warning popups constantly.

You didn’t set an alarm. Your body dragged you out of sleep like it had a subpoena. It knows. It has *always* known. Today is the day your academic self-worth becomes a PDF with no margins for mercy.

Tell yourself you’re calm. You are not calm. You have been stress-dreaming about Bluebook citations chasing you down a hallway while yelling “id.” You have been micro-stressing in your sleep like a Dell laptop running Westlaw. You wake up sweating and already exhausted, which is impressive considering you have not yet suffered.

Check your email. Nothing. Refresh. Nothing. Refresh again like the portal is shy, or coy, or wants to see how bad you really want it.

Convince yourself grades probably won’t be released today. They said “mid-January,” which is not a date but a *vibe*. Go make coffee. Spill it immediately. Stare at the spill. Whisper, “Yeah. That tracks.”

Sit down at your computer. Log into the student portal. Your password doesn’t work. Of course it doesn’t. Why would *anything* work today? Panic-reset it. Create a new password you will absolutely forget. Forget it instantly. This is foreshadowing.

Finally log in. Stare at the screen. The grades tab is there. It has always been there. But today it looks… different. Sharper. Judgmental. It knows what it did.

Do not click it. Hover over it. Pull your hand back like it bit you. Text your non-existent law school group chat “are grades out???” even though you already know they are because the universe feels loud and wrong.

If you had friends, one would reply “yeah.” Another would say “I’m sick.” A third would simply send “lol” and then never speak again.

Click the tab.

Your heart rate spikes like you’re being cold-called by God.

The page loads slowly. Painfully. Begin bargaining with God, the curve, your professor, and the one exam answer where you said “under common law principles (vibes).”

Grades appear.

You don’t understand them at first. Letters. Just letters. No comments. No explanations. No “great job!” No “we see your effort.” Just raw outcomes. This is the law.

You stare at the screen like maybe if you blink they’ll rearrange themselves into something better. They do not. They are committed to the bit. Precedent has been set.

Immediately calculate your GPA. Immediately calculate it again because that cannot be right. Use three different calculators. One of them is a Reddit comment from 2014. Average them. Panic anyway.

Fixate on the grade(s) that is/are lower than you expected. The one that hurt your feelings. Your brain is a hater and has chosen violence. Ignore the one that is fine. Ignore the one that is objectively good. Your brain has selected its emotional support failure.

Replay the exam in your head. Remember the question you thought you crushed. Realize you may have been hallucinating confidence due to malnutrition and caffeine poisoning.

Google “is it normal to get \[grade\] first semester 1L.”  
Results include:  
• “Yes, totally normal!”  
• “I got that and now I’m a federal judge.”  
• “You’re cooked.”  
• “Pack sunscreen.”  
Close the tab. Open it again. Close it harder.

Check the curve breakdown. Realize you do not know how curves work. Decide the curve is personal. Decide the curve hates you. Decide the curve saw something in you and said *absolutely not*.

Text your family. They say “We’re proud of you!” You feel nothing. You respond “thanks!” with a thumbs-up like a hollow corporate email sent from a ghost.

Text a friend from school. They say “same boat.” You don’t know what that means. Is it *your* boat? A better boat? A boat with oars? A boat with jobs? What boat. Titanic boat. Rowboat. Yacht. You need clarification and will not get it.

Convince yourself this determines your entire career. Remember someone once said “grades don’t matter.” Remember someone else said “grades are literally everything.” Decide both are true. Decide neither are true. Decide grades are everything. Decide grades mean nothing. Decide law school is fake. Decide *you* are fake.

Spiral about OCI. Spiral about clerkships. Spiral about jobs that do not yet exist but that you are somehow already disqualified from.

Open your outline folder. Close it. Why is it even there? Who are you to look at it?

Consider dropping out for exactly eleven seconds. Decide you are too tired to fill out the withdrawal form.

Look at the grades again. They have not changed. They will never change. This is permanence. This is the law. This is your villain origin story.

Refresh the page just in case. Same.

Suddenly feel extremely protective of your GPA like it is a wounded animal. You may insult it, but no one else is allowed to. Especially Reddit.

Go on r/LawSchool “just to see how others are feeling.” Read a post titled “Grades Aren’t Everything!” followed immediately by “If You’re Below Median, It’s Over.” Develop a twitch. Close Reddit. Open it again.

Close your laptop.

Sit in silence.

Then open it again and recalculate your GPA one more time, just to be sure.

Congratulations. You have received your first 1L grades. You gained a letter, lost years off your life, and unlocked a brand-new anxiety that will now follow you like a clerkship you didn’t apply for.

**Memory transcription subject: Lanaj, Venlil Bricklayer**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: January 7th, 2137*

\++++++++++



The two of us stood in the shade of a local grocer’s wide tent. My daughter was busy inspecting various pieces of produce, trying to find the substitutions she’d need to replicate her planned Human dish without access to their home’s ingredients. While she didn’t know how some of these Earth vegetables tasted, it seemed like other brave aspiring cooks had begun compiling tips online.

Unfortunately, I couldn’t really focus on helping her in her quest. Right now, my attention was set fully on the masked Human doing the same two rows down.

There were… a lot more of them out than I expected.

They’d been getting braver recently; more and more of them had been wandering outside their designated districts and interacting with the rest of town. Trying to make herds with the locals, find work, and see what Venlil Prime had to offer. And slowly, but surely, the town was adapting. I was starting to see “Humans Welcome!” signs in a lot of the stalls and businesses around town, and it seemed like the strange predators were starting to take notice. They weaved in and out of stalls and herds of prey, the herds themselves no longer parting quite so wide to keep their distance from the predators. The noise and chatter of the market that normally withered whenever a Human was around instead filled the air all around me.

Seeing them take an interest in our people and be accepted in turn was a good thing, for sure, but… but…

Suddenly, I startled as I felt something touch my shoulder. “Wh–”

“Dad?” my daughter asked. It was her tail. “You’ve gotta pay.”

“Huh? Oh…” We were at the cashier’s counter, the stall’s Gojid owner staring at me impatiently. I’d been focusing on the Humans in the herd and followed her without even realizing. “Sorry,” I apologized, my snout flushing orange.

I quickly paid for the vegetables and spices, and we made ourselves scarce before I could embarrass myself any further. “Did you get everything you needed?” I asked.

She pulled up the list on her pad. “Let’s see… we’ve got bitter melroot, deeproot, bunt leaves, ulren, some Yotulian ruje, dried magmaroot shavings, krasi bulbs… I think we’re only missing sharpseed oil.” my little blossom replied. She looked up at me as she shoved the device back in her bag. “Are… you okay?”

“I’m okay,” I lied. I don’t know how convincing I sounded, but it clearly wasn’t enough given the way her ears twisted.

“Are you sure? We can take a break,” she offered.

“I…” I wiggled my ears. I knew she meant well, but I felt like I was being treated like a pup. “Let’s just find the last thing. I can make it.”

“<Okay.> We’ll be quick.”

Yet despite our efforts, the last ingredient took quite a while to find. Sharpseed oil was an extremely spicy extract—so much so that even a single drop could add a lot of heat to a big dish. As such, even with the wide selection the Grove’s market had to offer, we had to search through several before finally finding it. By the end, I was positively wilted; it was taking everything I had to keep it together. So many people. Watching me. Or were they…?

“Ugh, *finally…*” Hiyla grumbled as we walked out of the stall. The little bottle of yellowish, unassuming liquid was dropped into one of the grocery bags. “Okay, that should be everything. Let’s go–”

She glanced up at me; I don’t know what she saw, but her eyes widened and she quickly took my paw in her tail. “Oh, Stars… Dad, you look *awful*,” she said quietly.

“B-Blossom, I’m *fine,*” I protested. I really just wanted to get out of here.

“No, you’re not. You’re shaking like a frightened sunspeck. I can feel it on my tail,” she replied.

*I am?* I looked at my free paw; sure enough, it trembled almost imperceptibly. I hadn’t even noticed. How long had that been going on? Had I always felt so lightheaded?

“I-It’s alright,” I tried to argue to one of the only people I could fully trust. We’d been walking for so long, it was getting hard to breathe. “I-I don’t want you to have to worry about me so much. Come on, let’s just go–”

At that moment, a random Human from the herd accidentally bumped my shoulder. Their masked face snapped in my direction, and I think I might have heard something like a brief apology—but I barely registered it under the horrible shrill bleat that escaped my throat.

It cut right through the noise of the market, bringing it to a still silence. Nearly every eye, covered or not, immediately turned in my direction.

There were so many people. Watching. Waiting for me to slip up. To descend on me. Prey turned predators. No way to know for which is which. No escape. Nowhere to run. Hurts to breathe. Can’t even tell if some of them are really watching. But they must be. Watching. Always watching. Always the faceless eyes. Predators. Prey as predators, all around me!

Feel a tug on my arm. Pull away. Danger! Go away! No! It grabs again! No escape. Useless to try. Always useless. It’ll take me. Probably to treatment. Always the treatment. The faceless eyes watch. Unseen. Darkness in the edges of my vision. No sympathy. Don’t deserve it. None of us do.

Legs give out. Fall on the ground. Screamed at. Shaken. Curl into a ball. Waiting for the shock. Don’t even know what I did. But that never matters. A face. A worried face–

“DAD!”

All at once, my head clears. I’m back in the market. People are still watching, but the faces I can see look concerned. My daughter is the one shaking me, fear and worry plastered on her features.

“Dad! What’s wrong?! Dad!” she bleats.

“I…” My voice cracked. I wasn’t even sure.

Shame and grief washed over me all at once. I thought I could handle this; something as simple as running an errand with my daughter. I thought I had a better understanding of my limits, and I’d been doing *better.* But all I’d managed to do was cause a scene.

I never wanted either of my pups to see me like this. Let alone Hiyla. She’s still a pup... For Stars’ sake, I’m her father; wasn’t *I* supposed to protect *her?*

My daughter had stopped shaking me, but still had a look of blind panic on her features. She didn’t know what to do. I reached out and put a paw on her shoulder.

“I’m… I’m okay…” I managed to say. My throat felt tight.

“Dad…?”

One of the Humans—the one who bumped into me, I think—cautiously stepped closer with that gentle, smooth gait I saw on a lot of my coworkers when they were trying not to frighten the jumpier prey.. “Uh, sorry, man… are you alright? I didn’t mean it–”

“I-It’s alright…” I croaked. Thoughts were hard, everything felt… jumbled. Blended together into a soupy mess.

“A-Are you hurt?” my little blossom asked anxiously. “Sh-Should I… Oh, Stars, what do I do? M-Maybe I should call an ambulance–”

“No!” I ordered, far louder than I intended. She jumped in shock; it only made me feel worse. “I…” What did I need? Shelter. I needed… shelter. Somewhere with less people, less faceless voices.

I could barely focus, but in the haze, I spotted a small covered stall about fifty tails down the path. I needed to get there, and calm down. Somehow, I managed to stumble to my hindpaws, and quickly wrap my tail around my blossom’s wrist before making my way towards that singular guiding star. She let me lead her, but that look of worry never left her. People stared as I went. I tried not to focus on any of them. It’d just make things worse.

I pushed through the flaps. It was some kind of… bar? There were a few stools at a makeshift counter with an aging Gojid wearing an apron behind it, along with a single Venlil customer. The owner took one look at me and his ears drooped; I must have looked a mess.

“Water…” I croaked.

Wordlessly, the Gojid swiped up a cup and filled it with life-giving liquid. He didn’t even have time to place it on the counter before I took it from his paws and drank greedily, downing the whole thing in one big gulp.

“Dad? Are you okay?” my daughter asked worriedly. She still looked terrified.

“I’m…”  I squeezed my eyes shut. Everything still felt foggy, like someone had jammed woolgrass into my head. But that wasn’t important right now; I knelt down, scooping her into a hug. I needed to assuage her own fears. “I’m okay. I’m sorry I scared you.”

“I… Forget about me! You looked like you were going to have a heart attack!” she bleated tearfully. But she wrapped her arms around me all the same.

*Stars… I’ve had to do a lot of apologizing to pups today. I’m such a mess… I never want her to have to worry about a broken old Ven like me.*

“Uh, is… everything alright?” the Gojid asked, peeking at us from over the counter. “Was that you who screamed out there?”

“I’m… yes, sorry,” I sighed. Worry about the shame later, just… try to clear my thoughts right now. I stood and looked around; we were enclosed in a dark-green tent, by a tarp cut into sections that hung down to around my waist. I could occasionally see the hindpaws of passerbys walking outside, but knowing they weren’t looking at me was already doing wonders for my psyche. The air tasted strange. Not like alcohol, but bitter, burnt, and yet oddly pleasant, like Sulean incense. It was all… strangely cozy.

I also happened to glance at the Venlil customer. Just idly, while I was drinking in the details of this warm little haven from the crowds. But my attention snapped back to him when I realized what I’d seen. He was wearing combat gear. The same padding I’d seen Flowerbud wear when I visited her gym back when they were still secret. The gloves and leg protectors still covered his limbs, but the helmet sat next to him on one of the empty stools.

Wait… Actually, now that I got a good look at him, I recognized him. He was the pup from last paw. I talked to him through the fence, when I was helping with finishing the brickwork.

I must have been staring, because he suddenly glared up at me. *“What?”* he practically growled.

*…Nope, not dealing with that right now.*

I turned back to the Gojid. “What is this place?” I asked, hoping to change the subject from my outburst.

“This is my little makeshift coffee shop,” the Gojid replied, his voice filled with pride. “Pikro, of Pikro’s Coffee Cradle, at your service. Name still pending.”

“Coffee?” Where have I heard that before…? I think Flowerbud mentioned it to me once?

“It’s a kind of tea from Earth. Learned how to make it from the best,” he explained confidently. “Completely prey-safe, and it’s got a lot of caffeine, so it’ll put some pep in your step. How about a cup?”

*I suppose it can’t hurt.* I turned back to my daughter. “Would it be alright if I took a little break here?”

She flicked an ear. She was still anxious, but looked a bit better now that I seemed better myself. “Can I try too?” she mumbled quietly.

“To be honest, it’s a bit of an acquired taste for a Venlil. It’s a complex drink with a lot of depth, but it’s always bitter,” he said. “Why don’t you try some of your father’s first? I’ll get you something else if you don’t like it.”

“Okay…” she relented. We both took a seat at the counter and watched the Gojid begin the surprisingly intricate process of preparing the drink. We asked questions as he worked, which he was all too happy to answer; the drink was a simple tea made from ground roasted seeds of the Earthen coffee plant, yet it had a wide variety of brewing methods and variations, and the seeds themselves had hundreds of different strains that could each impart subtle differences in taste. I never knew Humans took their tea so seriously.

Eventually, a small teacup of steaming, dark liquid was placed in front of me on a saucer, along with a few sugar packets and a small spoon. “Enjoy,” the brewer said.

I carefully took the cup, tasting the air around it. It was as warm and inviting as a fireplace, prompting me to take a small sip. Immediately, flavors exploded across my tongue; a deep bitterness that almost made me wince, yet hidden just underneath were hints of… fruit? There was a delicate flavor to it that prompted me to have just a bit more, even without the assistance of the sugar.

“It’s good,” I said. The Gojid simply flicked an ear in appreciation while he washed dishes.

“Can I try?” My daughter took the cup right as I placed it back down, taking a sip before I could react. Her eyes widened, and her face and features contorted into a grimace, though she managed to swallow before sticking out her tongue. “Blegh!”

“Blossom…!” *Don’t be rude!*

“No, it’s alright. That’s the reaction I get from all the pups,” the Gojid laughed. “Want some fruit juice instead? I’ve got stingfruit, lampan–”

“Ooh, lampan, please!” she bleated, returning the cup of bitter tea to me without a second glance. A tall glass of cold yellowish juice was placed in front of her a moment later, which she took to happily.

“This is a nice little stand you’ve got here, uh… Pikro,” I said, watching my daughter’s tail wag in delight. “Very cozy. I like how it’s covered.”

“Thanks. It’s my little den away from my den,” the Gojid said. “The covering’s pretty new, actually. Got the idea from a Human customer; it’ll let them take off those masks in here so they can relax without scaring the people on the main path.”

“Huh…” *Is that so…?*

My daughter, having finished her juice, placed the now empty glass on the counter. “Thank you!” she bleated merrily, before turning to the only other occupant in the stall; the ornery Venlil yearling two seats down, staring into his own cup. “Um, excuse me… those are fighting pads, right? Are you a fighter?” she asked.

His ears rose in surprise, probably from hearing such a term or knowledge come from a small pup, and he glanced up to look at us. A moment later, a look of recognition flashed across his features. He probably remembered me, but I wondered if he’d met my daughter somewhere before, too. But eventually, his gaze quietly returned to the dark tea in his cup. It had long since gone cold.

“...I thought I was,” he mumbled, just as bitter as the drink he stared into.

“You thought?”

“Yeah.” He sighed in frustration. “I, look, I don’t want to talk about it with some pup, alright? Just leave me alone.”

…What a rude little brat.

“O-Oh…” My daughter went quiet for a moment. “Um, have you met my sister then? She goes to Starlit Hope, and she’s really nice. I bet she’d help you if you’re having trouble.”

Rather than the positive, hopeful reaction either of us were expecting, though, the Venlil’s ears once again rose in shock. He sank his snout even deeper into the counter this time.

“...You don’t happen to mean the gray exterminator, do you?”

“Nnno? She’s a really light brown color, and has this Human jacket she likes to wear.”

Snout met counter with a heavy *thud.* “Of course. Of brahking course I run into her family when I don’t want anyone to see me,” he grumbled to himself. “Am I being punished? Haven’t I been punished enough already?”

“Uhh…” My daughter didn’t know how to respond. I didn’t blame her; I didn’t either. “Punished? What happened?”

“I said I don’t want to talk about it!” he suddenly snapped. 

Turning a half-circle in the seat, he began roughly pulling off the gloves and leg pads he was wearing, and haphazardly tossing them towards the helmet on the stool next to them. My daughter turned slightly to glance at me, signing a silent “<what’s his problem?>” with her tail. Only one of the gloves landed on the cushion; the rest fell into a loose pile on the ground.

“Take these back. I didn’t mean to steal them,” he fumed, sliding off the stool and starting to walk out. “Since your sister’s so much *nicer* and *better* than me, I’m sure she’ll understand.”

“Wh-What?” my daughter stammered. “I don’t get it. Wh-What happened?”

“You want to know what happened?” he snapped, whipping back around to glare at the both of us and causing Blossom to lean back in her seat. I quickly put my tail in front of her, between the two of them. “I humiliated myself in front of everyone there! I challenged that girl, your sister, to a fight so that I could skip all the boring running and weightlifting and speh and get right to the good stuff. And I got completely destroyed! I didn’t even hit her *once!* And the whole thing was *my* fault!”

*He challenged her…?* “Didn’t you only start last paw?” I asked.

“Don’t remind me…” he brayed solemnly. A lot of the anger seemed to have left him with the outburst, and he’d shifted back to depression. “I already know it was a mistake. I thought I’d win because I was bigger than her, but I didn’t think it through. Just like always.”

He shuffled back into his stool and collapsed into it, holding up his forehead with his paws. “All I ever do is disappoint everyone and brahk up everything I touch. Anything I try to do on my own turns out terrible. It’s no wonder barely anybody actually likes me.”

My ears fell. I didn’t want to pry too much into this stranger’s life, but…

“Did they kick you out for losing, or something?” I asked.

He flicked both his ears in a *no.* “They were all nice about it. I don’t even get *why.* But I ran off like a baby pup when I lost.” He sighed. “Some predator I am… speh, even the actual predators were pitying me afterwards. I almost wish they’d just killed me.”

“You’re not a predator just because you like fighting,” my daughter interjected.

“No, that’s not…”

He sank even lower into his own arms and went quiet. I picked up my tea and drank what was left. I could see why my older daughter liked this stuff… even if it was making me feel a bit jittery.

“Why did you want to join in the first place?” I asked curiously.

“Cuz, well…”

It took him a little while to continue. Maybe he didn’t even really know himself.

“…I get… angry, all the time,” he explained. “It’s probably some kinda Predator Disease. I dunno. But it’s constant. I’m not really smart, and a lot of my ideas usually turn out to be awful, so that means that usually no one really listens to what I’ve got to say. And it just… pisses me off. My parents are rich and I’m still not technically an adult, so they can keep me out of any real trouble. But I’m just a big disappointment to them, and everyone kinda avoids me cuz I keep blowing up over stupid speh.”

He picked up his own cup, and stared at the black liquid inside, before placing it back down without drinking. “Everyone always called me a predator, cuz even when I tried to be a *good herd member,* I’d always end up taking something the wrong way and getting angry. Even my parents are starting to believe it. I only have one actual friend, and every time I screw up I’m afraid I’m gonna disappoint her too.” He began to idly scratch a groove into the counter. “I guess, eventually, I just… decided to embrace it. Everyone already thought I was a predator, so why not just act like one? I could make them all afraid of me and get respect that way. And if I could learn to *fight* like a predator, it’d work even better.”

I tilted my head. “So… you want to attack or intimidate people to make them respect you? That’s not real respect.”

“I already know that,” he admitted bitterly. “But I guess… I thought it was the closest I’d ever get.”

“I see…”

I guess this is what can happen when Predator Disease goes totally untreated. I had no illusions about what had happened to me, and wouldn’t wish it upon anyone no matter how badly they needed help, but… leaving these problems unchecked can cause people a lot of pain too.

“Stars, why am I even telling either of you all of this?” he whined. “I don’t even know you, there’s nothing you can do about it.”

“Probably not,” I admitted. “And to be honest, I do question whether you should actually go back, given your motivations. But, you know… I don’t think making a mistake is *stupid*. Like, sure, you made a rash decision, but I doubt any of the Humans or prey there are really going to hold it over you. There’s nothing stopping you from going back next paw, if you wanted.”

“Are you serious?” he scoffed. “Running off like a coward after a loss like that? I’m at the bottom of their pack, man. No way they’ll let me back in after that.”

“Their *pack?*”

“Yeah. I needed to establish myself as a high-ranking member by beating one of the stronger ones, and I blew it. Like an idiot.”

My daughter and I shared another look. “…I… don’t think they’re like that,” I replied slowly. “They’re more herd-like than anything, from my experience. You’d be treated like you’re *new,* but…”

“Seriously…?” he groaned, mumbling mostly to himself. “Stars, why do these predators have to be so damn *boring…?*”

…Does he WANT to get kicked out?

“I, look, I’m not saying you have to fight my daughter again right away,” I explained, trying to change the subject and only having a brief mental disconnect from the idea of potentially encouraging exactly that. “I’m not wholly familiar with how things work there, but the Humans would train you, right? You could try again once you’re more confident, if you wanted. No one’s going to fault you for not having the knowledge right at the start.”

“Who cares? I’m just going to get destroyed again,” he spat bitterly.

“So pick yourself up and try again.”

He scoffed. “Oh, it’s that easy, huh?”

“I’m not saying it’ll be *easy,*” I countered. “Far from it. I’ve only ever watched the sport from the outside, but the things those people put themselves through in the name of their craft seem absolutely brutal. Yet they do it anyway, for their own reasons.”

His ears twitched as he thought. “…I don’t really have a reason anymore,” he said.

“Why not find a new one, then?”

He didn’t reply, so I simply shrugged with my tail. “Look, I’m not saying you *have to* go back, or even that you *should.* That gym’s not a place for most people; I know it’s not as bad as people might believe at first, but I’d still never join myself in a million cycles,” I whistled. “There’s one thing I can tell you, though: You’re not going to earn any real, genuine respect if you always run the moment things stop going your way.”

“…So, what, I should go back and get tossed around some more?” he asked. Less angrily this time, and more… confused. “What’s that going to accomplish?”

“...I guess…” It was hard to put my thoughts into words. “When I first found out that my daughter was herding with Humans, I was absolutely furious. I thought it was the dumbest, wool-brained, most dangerous idea I’d ever heard. And even back then, she only told me she was *exercising* with them; it was a while before she admitted any of the combat aspects. But either way, she went through with it despite all my misgivings, and worked hard, coming home completely exhausted every paw, and… now I couldn’t be more proud of her. Seeing her put her whole heart and soul into something was inspiring, you know? Even if I didn’t agree at first.”

The Venlil listened quietly, seemingly turning the words over in his head.

“Look, I don’t know if all your ideas are actually bad, or anything like that,” I continued. “But even if they are, there’s something to be said about taking a bad idea and putting your whole back into it. If people see you really working hard at something, they tend to respect the *effort,* regardless of the end result. And if you stumble on the way or embarrass yourself a bit, so what? Just keep working at it.”

“...How do I know that’s going to work?” the Venlil asked.

“You don’t,” I shrugged. “But it’s better than just giving up, right?”

He stared straight ahead, thinking. Staring at the cold drink in his cup, with little twitches of his tail and ears.

Eventually, he lifted a paw. “Hey, could I get some sugar packets?”

The Gojid teaman was shaken out of his stupor. “Huh? Oh… right,” he stammered. I’d almost forgotten he was there.

Either way, he grabbed a few packets and gave them to the Venlil, who began tearing them open and dumping them into his cup. Once he’d used them all, he downed the rest of his drink in one go with a light grimace. “Mmph… better, but still not great,” he said. He went to leave, but not before glancing at me over his shoulder. “...I’ll think about it. And, uh…”

I tilted my head. “<Yes?>”

“Uh…” His snout tinged a bit orange, and his ears pinned back. “…Don’t tell Lerai we talked, got it?”

I couldn’t help but whistle, which only made him bloom even more. “I mean it!” he bleated.

“Alright, alright. <Promise,>” I agreed.

He only sighed. “Whatever,” he grumbled. “Stars, I need a brezik…”

With that, he left, disappearing into the formless hindpaws of the crowd.

“...Weird kid,” the Gojid observed. “Wandered in like a lost pup.”

“I dunno. I don’t think he was so bad,” my daughter replied.

I simply stared at the spot where he’d left. I didn’t know if I was any help, but… I had the sense he still had a lot of things to figure out. A lot of people liked to dismiss the problems of pups and young adults as simple, but they couldn’t always be solved with a quick pep-talk.

Either way, I was left to relax with my daughter for a moment longer. With my mind taken off my own screw-ups by that conversation, I was already feeling a lot better.

“...Hey, Dad?” my daughter began.

“Yeah?”

“Promise you’ll tell me if you’re feeling bad like that again, okay?”

“Oh, little blossom…” I leaned over and pulled her towards me with my arm and tail. “I’m sorry. I don’t want you to have to worry about me.”

“Why not?”

“Because…” *Because you had to grow up too fast. Because you should be worrying about normal pup things like school and friends, not whether your father’s going to be able to handle a simple errand run.*

“Well, I’m gonna,” she declared before I could voice any of my inner turmoil. “You’re my dad. How could I not worry? It’s not fair that only *you* should have to worry about *me,* you know.”

“I don’t know if it’s that simple.”

“Yeah, it is. Why do you people keep overcomplicating things?” she huffed. “You *just* told that guy that it’s fine if you mess up as long as you’re doing your best.”

“…I did,” I relented. I wasn’t entirely sure I agreed right now; I wished I could see things as simply as her. But her heart was in the right place. “Okay, I’ll try.”

“Good!” She slid off her seat. “Come on, let’s get home if you’re feeling better. I wanna start cooking.”

I flicked an ear, quickly tapping my pad to pay for the drinks. “Thank you,” I said to the Gojid behind the counter.

“Come back anytime.”

I began to walk out with my daughter in tow, before suddenly remembering. “Oh, right, we need to take th–”

But as I turned to collect the pads and helmet that the Venlil had left behind, I only found an empty seat.

They were already gone.

1q4uctn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1q4uctn/aitah_for_being_hurt_for_my_husband_leaving_me_to/,AITAH for being hurt for my husband leaving me to go to the gym?,"I (f, 29) and my husband (m,30) have been married for 10 years. I’ve lost 50 lbs in the last couple of years and my husband just started on his fitness journey a few months ago. Because I started a physically demanding job I’ve fallen off at the gym but I’ve maintained my weight and lost muscle tone. For a month I said once the new year comes I’m going to start working out again (the holidays is our busy season) so two days ago I asked to try his pre workout on my first day back. He said sure and offered to make me a cup. 

I told him to give me a half or quarter of a scoop because I’m sensitive to preworkout. I’m also on Wellbutrin for anxiety and it already has a stimulant. The workout was great but did say it was a little strong. I didn’t workout too long because I did legs and 9 months ago I tore a calf and didn’t want to push it. The next day I went back to the gym and asked if he could make me another cup (he has a lot of supplements and I wasn’t sure what he used). 

I get to the gym have a great workout but noticed I had to keep going but thought it wasn’t awful as I was doing arms and had no previous injuries. By this time I’ve worked out for 90 minutes and 25 of those were cardio. After my workout I had to leave straight after the gym to pick up my daughter from a friend’s. I drove for 5 minutes and realized I was feeling off. I called my husband and asked if he put a half a scoop. He asked why and If I had a good workout. I said yes but explained I felt off, like I had to vomit and wasn’t sure I should be driving. He stated that he gave me a full scoop and thought I meant just a half a scoop for the first day so I could get acclimated. 

I explained that didn’t make any sense. I picked up my daughter and focused hard to get us home. As soon as I walked through the door I grabbed a banana and explained I was going to lay down. 15 minutes later passed he comes joyfully walking up the stairs singing and getting ready for the gym. 5 minutes passed and he asked was I okay. I said no as I felt awful and I can’t even close my eyes because they were twitching also my palms and feet were clammy. I was so glad I didn’t take my medication. 

I go downstairs because I look up how to help how I was feeling and on google it said electrolytes helped. So I’m making it and say that I’m about to cook. At this point he’s making all his supplements to leave. I say I’m going to have such a hard time sleeping and ask if he can stop on the way home at the store to get me something so I can rest. He reluctantly says yes but can I put the chicken in the oven for his meal prep. I kind of feel like he shouldn’t have asked me because at this point I shouldn’t even be cooking. But I say yes. He then tells me this pre workout is 700 mg of caffeine. I say that shouldn’t even be legal. I don’t even drink a coffee after having a 200 mg energy drink in the morning. And he leaves. 

I start the oven and decide I should take a quick shower since I was still dirty from the gym. My kids (they’re 6 and 4) are watching tv.  I make sure I didn’t make the shower too hot because I don’t want to raise my blood pressure. I’m not even in the shower for three minutes and I notice I’m seeing stars. So I call my mom and tell her what’s going on (she doesn’t live too far) so if an emergency happens and my kids try to call her she knows. She asks where my husband is… I said the gym (it’s 25 mins away) and she’s pissed. She texts him and states he shouldn’t have left me without my knowledge. Not even 30 seconds passed and he calls me with an attitude saying “ I have to turn around your mom is complaining I left you” so I say “ it was kind of shitty you left me” he says “I can’t deal with you two” and hangs up on me. Almost acting if we’re being dramatic. 

So he pissed I called my mom. But he saw what state I was in and still chose to leave and I was scared. I’m not mad that he made a mistake even though I think he was careless and didn’t listen to me the day before but I do feel like the attitude was unnecessary. So AITAH?

I’m a recently separated Army logistics officer actively trying to relocate to Austin and break into the civilian job market. I’ve applied around but figured it’d be smart to actually start meeting people in the city instead of just firing resumes into the void.

My background is in logistics, supply chain, operations, and program management. Leading teams, managing complex operations, and driving execution in fast-paced environments. I’m targeting roles in those areas and would love to connect with locals who work in operations, tech, manufacturing, retail, or logistics.

I’m mainly here to:

* Grow my Austin network
* Learn which companies are great to work for
* Get insight from people already in the space
* And hopefully land something meaningful

If you’re open to connecting, grabbing coffee, or pointing me in the right direction, I’d really appreciate it.

1q4ubup,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTireland/comments/1q4ubup/i_want_to_get_closer_to_someone_from_work_i/,"I want to get closer to someone from work I hooked up with. How should I proceed, if at all?","About 3 and a half months ago I hooked up with another guy from work. Thing is, neither of us are out so we’ve kept it a secret. We’re both bi. 

We continued to message each other afterwards though, including sending nsfw pics etc. and talking about how we both wanted to hook up again. Problem was, neither of us had any availability to have the other one over so it hasn’t actually happened yet. 

About 2 months after that night, I noticed he started being very quiet with me so I asked if something was wrong. He said that he’s started seeing a girl so he didn’t want to continue ‘texting’ me like that while that’s going on. He said if the relationship ends he’ll let me know because he said he’d love to make time for us to hook up, which suggests to me that he’s taking it pretty casually. 

Him wanting to stop those sorts of conversations while he’s with her is of course fine with me, but I can’t stop thinking about him for two main reasons. 

Firstly, he’s the only person that knows about my sexuality, and I’m only the second person to know about his, so I’d like to keep talking to him and get a bit closer because, to me, it’d feel like a waste otherwise. 

We work in different departments so we don’t see each other very often at all and we don’t  actually know each other very well. That being said, I still want to keep in touch given we know each other’s big secret. 

Secondly, I just can’t stop thinking about him. I guess I’m just frustrated that we didn’t get to hook up again but I’ve started to really like him. I’ve always had a thing for him (3+ years of occasionally seeing him in work) and it’s playing on my mind. 

We’ve both said that we don’t want a boyfriend given that we haven’t come out and we’re bi anyway but I’d try it out with him. He’s the only guy I’ve ever liked like that, hence why I’ve never felt the need to come out because I’ve only ever looked for hookups with guys.

Is it worth asking him if he wants to grab a coffee at work or to strike up a conversation again some other way? Not to confess that I like him, but just to potentially help form a friendship. 

He would often start the conversation when we were texting each other so I know the physical attraction is mutual. He’s the one who gave me his Snapchat username so he was clearly into it at the time. We also had some conversations relating to us being bi and our experiences etc. so it’s not like it was all sexual either. 

Tl;dr: hooked up with another closeted bi guy who is now seeing a girl and doesn’t want to keep sexting me but I want to see if he is up for hanging out, without anything sexual happening, because it’d be nice to be able to openly talk to someone else irl who knows about my sexuality ",6,1767639025.0,LGBTireland,4,0.88,False

You finish your main coding work, and instead of resting or building cool features, you drag yourself to a coffee shop to ""do marketing.""

I was chatting with Josh recently (he runs **GymNote Plus**). He was stuck in this exact loop. Every weekend, he forced himself to sit down and grind out SEO blog posts for 2 hours.

He told me, ""It was just a chore... I wanted to focus on features.""

And honestly, the problem isn't just the lost time—it's the mental drain. When you force yourself to do work you resent, you burn out. Fast.

Eventually, Josh stopped fighting it. He decided to automate the ""chore"" part of his business so he could just get back to coding. He started using my tool, **Ship Content**, to handle the drafts.

The difference was pretty immediate:

* **Before:** 2 hours of frustration every Sunday.
* **After:** He spends that time building new features (the stuff he actually enjoys).

He sent me a video saying, ""I don't have to think about it anymore.""

I think that should be the goal for us: protect your energy for the ""high leverage"" tasks—like building a great product—and automate the boring stuff.

If you're dreading your ""marketing shift"" this weekend, maybe it's time to stop doing it manually.

I'm here to take my chances to get to know a person. As I only have one regret in life and that is when I'm gone, i don't want to be gone without truly knowing someone. Knowing someone as a friend is different from someone who knows how you wake up, how you have bad habits we have difficulty overcoming, or giving a simple gift because you know what someone really wants. I'll be covering some details about me and my expectations about you. If you don't think we align, please do not bother messaging as it will only waste both our time.

**About me**

I'm from the province but will  be moving to Manila soon, i prefer someone who I can hangout with the city vibes.



**Finances**

About me: I'm pretty comfortable with what I have. I don't make so much money like politicians but i hope to earn more than what I have today in a cleaner way. 

About you: Preferably want someone who values money and has no debt. I just want someone who is also mindful with expenses. No gambling addiction pls.



**Religion**

About me: I am agnostic so I don't believe in gods. We really shouldn't expect an ultimate reward for doing good.

About you: Prefer someone who aligns with my religious/unreligious goals haha



**Family**

About me: I do want to start a family but I want both my partner and I to be emotionally, mentally, financially stable. I am close with my family and we talk often.

About you: Looking for someone who has the same mindset.



**Fitness**

About me: I am someone who goes to the gym regularly, I am not yung super gymrat but I do value my fitness well to care.

About you: Don't mind if hindi ka naga gym as long as you are not letting yourself be undisciplined with your health.



**Other things**

About me: I'm around 5'9 or 5'10 depende sa sapatos ata lol. I'm medium light-skinned and i'm not chubby nor payat. Looks better in person sabi nila. I like learning and playing video games.

About you: Share me about yourself in a message so we can talk about it.



 Again, if you don't think that the things I've shared about me resonates with you. Feel free to drink a coffee instead, cheers!",1,1767638920.0,PhR4Dating,0,1.0,False

After not being able to sleep, getting ready, and driving over, I sat around for over 15 min while office staff tried to figure out what's going on. Finally the admin assistant comes out and tells me the job was put in by mistake because it's a PD day and there are no students on campus. They told me I could cancel or they will edit the job to half day, and since I was already there I didn't cancel. Our district handbook says schools pay us half day pay if they no longer need us or send us home early. I asked about getting my updated parking pass and they gave me a paper to sign and said I can come back the next day to get my pass. They said the staff had a meeting until lunchtime and said I could grab some breakfast in the meeting room before leaving, which included bagels and coffee. It felt awkward sitting in the large meeting room with people I never saw before so I just grabbed a bagel and left.
What would you have done? Does this happen regularly? Did they want me to come back when they said to bring the parking pass paper the next day? Would you return to this school? It's the 2nd closest HS to me, so I'm conflicted. ",6,1767638912.0,SubstituteTeachers,16,0.8,False

On one side, there’s natural stuff like black coffee + banana.
On the other, supplements like pre-workout powders (caffeine, citrulline, beta-alanine) or electrolyte drinks/tablets.
For people who train consistently (4–6 days a week):
What has worked best for you long term?
Any issues with dependency, sleep, or tolerance over time?
Is sticking to coffee/electrolytes smarter than hardcore pre-workouts?
Not looking for extreme energy spikes—just sustainable performance and focus.

It was to the point where I was thinking I could truly save him after vets gave me medication for him. I had a bit of hope that he would make it. The day I seen him suffering I had decided that I was going to euthanize him but my conscious said no because I was going to continue his medication. That same day he died at night. My heart aches tremendously everyday. The silence in my house is loud. I feel like I lost a part of myself. I had a coffee today and it was disgusting. My uncle is in the hospital for a really bad infection. Not sure if he will make it. I spent my weekend keeping him company at the hospital so he doesn’t feel alone. My aunt had told me he was crying for the days I didn’t see him due to my dog dying. It’s been hard man. My boyfriend hasn’t necessarily kept me company I understand he is busy with his own life. My heart hurts so much honestly my pets death has truly taken a toll on me. The morning after my dog died my dad was rushing me at the vet when I was saying goodbye to my dog cause I went to get him cremated I was sobbing my legs were trembling of how terrible it hit me. It hurt me so much how much he was telling me to hurry up with my final moments with my beloved baby.

I'm actively building a new circle of friends and looking for cool, open-minded people from all over the world – preferably from Germany, because I want to build real friendships in real life (but online/international connections are just as welcome).

A little about me: I'm Norbert, I work in HR/People, I'm pretty active (running is my thing), I enjoy cooking, and I'm always trying new things – recipes, videos, ideas, everything. I like people (sometimes) who are up for real conversations, not just small talk. Friendships that can grow: from ""let's grab a drink sometime"" to ""let's spontaneously plan a weekend trip.""


```
What I'm looking for:

• People who are reliable and don't just write ""we should meet up sometime""

• Humor, curiosity, a little bit of chaos in your mind is okay

• Interest in doing things together: coffee, walks, food, sports, museums, bars, events, cooking, whatever works

• Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia - Düsseldorf & surrounding area) would be ideal for IRL – but if you're somewhere else: get in touch anyway

If you want to get a feel for my vibe: You can find more on Instagram at piroggen_prinz.


When you write, please include:

1. Where you're from

2. What you currently have the most energy for (e.g., sports, food, travel, games, art, tech, whatever)

3. Whether you'd prefer IRL, online, or both

No drama, no sales talk – just honest people who want to make each other's lives a little better.

We're looking for goofy, mature people with level heads and a good sense of humor. Our group was previously midcore/semi-hardcore, but as three of our members have recently had children and we've all gotten a little older, we've decided to switch to a ""motivated casual"" style.

We're raiding Tues/Wed 7:30-9 pm ET on Primal DC. Discord required. There is a possibility we will extend our raid time to 9:30 pm ET, so let us know if this will prevent you from joining us (it won't disqualify you).

Crafted gear is not expected, but consumables are. If you won't be using crafted gear then we do expect that you will keep up with tome gear and normal raid drops. Reading up on upcoming fight mechanics is a requirement, this will not be a blind party due to our short raid times.

I wanted to get some opinions on backflushing habits.

Right now, every day that I use my machine, I do a water-only backflush for \~15 seconds. I don’t use Cafiza at all — just plain water. I’m wondering if this is sufficient or if I should be using detergent more often.

For context:

•	Machine: ECM Mechanika Slim PID

•	Water: 1 gallon distilled water from Whole Foods + Third Wave Water (espresso machine profile)

•	I only ever use this water in the machine

•     I use a puck screen with every pull

Is a daily water-only backflush a good practice, or could this lead to coffee oil buildup or other issues inside the machine over time if Cafiza isn’t used regularly? If you do use Cafiza, how often do you think is appropriate with a setup like this?

I’m a recently separated Army logistics officer actively trying to relocate to Austin and break into the civilian job market. I’ve applied around but figured it’d be smart to actually start meeting people in the city instead of just firing resumes into the void.

I’m targeting roles in those areas and would love to connect with locals who work in operations, tech, manufacturing, retail, or logistics.

* Grow my Austin network
* Learn which companies are great to work for
* Get insight from people already in the space
* And hopefully land something meaningful

By the end of this, you’ll see why letting go feels like losing your identity — and how staying in this loop quietly costs you years without realizing it.  It starts in those first quiet moments, alone in your apartment, when the absence hits like a wave you didn’t see coming.
You tell yourself it’s just temporary, but deep down, there’s this pull, this unspoken dread that without them, you’re somehow less.
That silent pain: the fear that this person was your last shot at feeling truly alive, and moving on means admitting you bet everything on the wrong hand.
It’s not something you voice at brunch with friends in Toronto or over coffee in Chicago — it’s the ache that lingers when the lights go out.  You replay those late-night talks, the way they looked at you, not because you want the pain, but because it’s familiar in a world that feels suddenly foreign.
Pause for a second — this isn’t weakness; it’s your brain’s way of holding on to what once felt safe.
In the glow of your phone screen at 2 AM, you hover over their name, knowing one tap could reignite the spark or shatter the illusion.
That’s the entry point, where attachment recycling begins — not as a choice, but as an automatic response to the void.
But here’s the uncomfortable part nobody tells you: this pattern doesn’t just happen; it’s wired into you from years of seeking connection in a disconnected age.
Think about your last scroll through Instagram — exes popping up in stories, mutual friends tagging them — it’s designed to keep you hooked, turning heartbreak healing into a daily battle.
You convince yourself it’s harmless, just checking in, but each glance reinforces the cycle, making post-breakup recovery feel impossible.  This is only the beginning.
The deeper layers — intermittent reinforcement, how it reshapes your identity, and the precise way to break the loop — are in the full video.

I am a very basic coffee drinker and tend to usually drink it iced with creamer. I did however want to experiment with different beans and grinding my own to see if I could consistently make something I would like at home. 

Current set up: 
- Bonavita 5cup 
- baratza encore grinder

 First beans I tried were Sputniks, a medium roast, which I found to be too acidic for my taste/use case. Next I tried some pre-ground Kirkland Supremo Bean dark roast and enjoyed that more. Makes sense since that’s when I learned dark roast is less acidic. 

Is there a dark roast that you recommend I try if I liked the Kirkland?

1q4tz0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1q4tz0q/why_smart_men_stop_trusting_motivation_10000/,"Why Smart Men Stop Trusting Motivation (10,000 Notes Later)","I spent a year drowning in notes. Like proper drowning. Had folders within folders, tags for tags, a color-coding system that would make Marie Kondo weep. Thought I was building some genius second brain. Turns out I was just hoarding digital clutter and calling it productivity.

The breaking point? Couldn't find a single useful note when I actually needed one. Classic. Started digging into research from cognitive scientists, productivity nerds on YouTube, and honestly just trial and error that made me want to throw my laptop out the window. What I found completely flipped how I think about learning and memory. 

Turns out our brains don't work like filing cabinets. They work like networks. Messy, chaotic, beautiful networks. And once you stop fighting that and start working with it, everything changes.

**Stop organizing, start connecting.** This sounds counterintuitive as hell but hear me out. Dr. Barbara Oakley (engineering prof who literally wrote the book on learning) explains in Learning How to Learn that our brains don't retrieve information by searching through neat categories. They follow trails of association. Like how thinking about coffee makes you think about mornings which makes you think about being tired which reminds you of that embarrassing thing you said in 2015. Fun times.

So instead of spending hours deciding if a note about habit formation goes in ""Psychology"" or ""Self Improvement"" or ""Productivity"", I just link it to related concepts. Reading about dopamine? Link it to your note about social media addiction, motivation, and that time you rage-quit Instagram for a week. Your brain already does this naturally. Your notes should too.

Zettelkasten is the fancy German word for this method, made famous by sociologist Niklas Luhmann who wrote 70 books using it. But you don't need to get precious about the system. Just make connections and watch the magic happen.

**Write in your own words, not copy paste hell.** This was the game changer nobody talks about. I used to highlight everything, copy entire paragraphs, felt super productive. Remembered exactly nothing. 

There's this concept called ""desirable difficulty"" from psychologist Robert Bjork's research at UCLA. Basically, making things slightly harder actually improves learning. When you force yourself to rewrite something in your own words, your brain has to process it, understand it, reshape it. That's where the actual learning happens.

Make It Stick by Peter Brown breaks this down beautifully (won tons of awards, these guys literally study how memory works). They found that the effort of recall and rephrasing creates stronger neural pathways than passive reading. So now when I'm reading something good, I close the book and write what I remember. Messy, imperfect, in whatever words come out. Works stupidly well.

For tracking this stuff I use Readwise which syncs highlights from everywhere and actually prompts you to review them. Not sponsored, just genuinely useful because it forces that recall practice.

BeFreed is an AI-powered personalized learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create custom audio podcasts and adaptive learning plans based on your actual goals. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts, it lets you customize the depth (10-min summaries or 40-min deep dives with examples) and choose voices that actually keep you engaged, from sarcastic to smoky tones. 

The adaptive learning plan evolves as you interact with it, and you can chat with the virtual coach Freedia about your struggles to get recommendations tailored to you. It's been surprisingly helpful for internalizing concepts during commutes instead of mindlessly scrolling. Worth checking out if you want structured learning that fits your schedule.

**Review notes like you're explaining to a confused friend.** Best thing I ever did was start a weekly ""note review"" habit. Not reading through everything like some robot, but picking random notes and seeing if I can actually explain the concept out loud. If you can't, you don't really know it.

The Feynman Technique is all about this. Richard Feynman (Nobel Prize physicist, absolute legend) would test his understanding by trying to explain complex physics to children. If he couldn't make it simple, he didn't understand it well enough.

I'll randomly open a note about cognitive biases or whatever and try explaining it like I'm texting a friend. Use stupid examples. Make it weird. The weirder the connection, the better you remember it honestly. Our brains love novelty.

Ash is actually great for this if you're working on mental models and thinking patterns. It's like having a personal coach who calls out your BS and helps you think clearer. Makes reviewing notes way more active.

**Don't chase the perfect system.** Here's the uncomfortable truth nobody wants to hear. I wasted MONTHS watching productivity YouTube, buying courses about note-taking systems, customizing templates. Classic procrastination disguised as preparation.

Your note-taking system doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be functional. There's actually research showing that ""productivity shame"" is a real thing. We feel like we need the perfect system before we start, so we never actually start. It's a trap.

Just pick something (Obsidian, Notion, literal paper notebooks, whatever) and start dumping thoughts. You can always migrate later. The best system is the one you'll actually use. Revolutionary concept I know.

The uncomfortable reality is that most of our learning struggles aren't about the tools. They're about our relationship with information and our own insecurities about intelligence. Society tells us smart people remember everything perfectly, organize flawlessly, never forget. That's nonsense. Even memory champions forget where they put their keys.

Your brain is plastic, adaptable, constantly rewiring itself based on what you do with it. It's not about having perfect notes. It's about building better thinking patterns. The notes are just scaffolding for that process. Once I stopped treating my notes like some sacred knowledge temple and started treating them like a playground for ideas, everything got easier.

The goal isn't to remember everything. It's to build a system that helps you think better, connect ideas faster, and actually use what you learn. That's it. Stop optimizing and start learning.",1,1767638288.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False

Dear fellow coffee lovers,

I purchased the ES701 a couple of weeks ago. I'm very happy with it, but there's one thing I can't get my head around, and that is the grind size for a single espresso.

It keeps recommending a grind size of 20+. If I ignore the recommendation and, for example, use grind size 8–12, the water will not run through properly and it will produce a little over 10 ml of coffee. If I select the recommended 20+ grind size, I get a perfect run-through, but the taste of the espresso is bad.

If I use the double basket with grind size 8, I get a perfect double espresso.

I already tried tamping a little softer. I started thinking that the holes in my single basket are not machined to the right size.

Ive tried to transition at least ten times and i keep backing out. Im small, curvy from waist training, my face is girlish, i was literally forced to voice train into a more feminine tone as a teen by my grandmother, i feel like ill never be right.

I dont even compare myself to cis men anymore, id kill to even be some fucking pooner with dyed hair and piercings but i cant even achieve that. Ive been trying that and i look like some alt girl. I hate this. I hate myself. I feel like im going insane. 

Please any advice is welcome other than ‘just stop caring!’ Or ‘start T!’ Im trying. Ive also BEEN on t for a year. Its done basically nothing. Im on a totally normal dosage but my hormones are jacked up because i have a fucking tumor in the back of my head on some gland that gives me the hormones on a pregnant woman. Because of course i do.

Not really. 

It's been a couple lazy days strolling around Savannah near-ish to River St. Pretty much no traveler kids around. No street musicians except the sax player that always plays by the ferry when tourists disembark.

The first few days were just me wandering around and remembering where everything is, finding a reasonably priced coffee shop to charge my stuff at, and where the food is. This place is full of food. If you're hungry in Savannah you're not making any effort.

Second night in I hit River St. to head back to camp. Spot a guy with a guitar. I meander over his way to see what he's playing. It appears he and the guy next to him are kinda huddled up talking/tuning/who knows what.

As I roll up, the non-guitar player looks up at me. ""You've been watching me for weeks and I want to know why."" ""I just hitchhiked into town two days ago."" ""Oh. You did?"" 

Pretty typical life-long aggressive drunk homeless dude. He swings his hand back to shake mine. I know what's coming. Dude has been a scared little bitch his whole life so he makes up for it by acting tough and trying to dominate other people. I put my hand out. He swings his as hard as he can and tries to give me the death grip.

I spent a few years as a stone mason. A little over thirty years playing guitar. I've worked countless hard manual labor jobs over the years. Good luck buddy.

His hand hits mine. I don't move a millimeter. He goes for the death grip. I match his strength and add some. I feel a tug. I yank him to his feet. He looks me in the eye to see if I'm impressed. I stare him right in the eye with an 'if you wanna dance I'll let you pick the music' look in my eye.

He softens up, welcomes me to Savannah. Introduces me to a guy smoking a joint. A few 'nice to meet yous' and a couple hits later I decide to bail.

This isn't my scene. It was for a lot of years. I spent a long time getting as fucked up as possible, starting street parties with my guitar, and hangin' with hotties.

These days I might have a beer a couple times a year. (Except at my brother's house, but we don't need to get into that. 😆) But I pretty much run solo. I've made my life as peaceful as I can, and I intend to keep it that way.

Yesterday I checked out a new feed for breakfast that wasn't here four years ago when I was here last. Walk in. There's a couple guys serving coffee. Bottled water and O.J. for us to grab on the table. 'Yay for coffee!' Grabbed one of each. Found a seat. EDC pack and hoody/coat combo on chair. 

Through the line. Breakfast burritos, fruit, and cheese crackers. I see a bottle of hot sauce nobody is touching. My southwest roots kick in. I shake out a decent amount of that stuff on my plate. Head back to my seat. 

There's now a few reasonably intelligent dudes sitting in front of me. (I'm on the corner of an L.) I listen for a bit. Decent conversation. These guys aren't drunks or addicts. I slowly ease my way into the conversation. 

Wound up hanging with these guys for the better part of the day. They're all around my age, not partyers as far as I can tell. One is a traveler like me. Not afraid of work. Been all over. We've covered a lot of the same ground. Gave eachother some info on different places we'd been. Some of it about here even.

All the places that stopped serving for the holidays are back open today. I have no idea when breakfast is, but I know where. Look the place up. ""Breakfast at 8:30."" 'What time is it? 7:45' It's roughly a half an hour walk.

Comb my hair, shove stuff in my pockets, check my small backpack, double check everything at lightning speed.

Out of the tent, through the trees and bushes, across the field, and out onto the street.

Made it with five minutes to spare. 'Perfect!' Dudes from yesterday walk up behind me.

Breakfast secured, I roll with the other traveler up to the library. Easy place to hang and charge...

1q4tsm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU/comments/1q4tsm9/personal_statment_for_application/,Personal Statment for Application,"Hi there,

I was thinking of applying for General Engineering at DTU for the upcoming Summer. As a foreign Student, I had to write a personal statement. Would someone be able to give me feedback on this personal statement? Thank you at advanced. 

  
It was back in elementary school when we had science class on which things burn and which don't, and why it was very basic, but that sparked my interest. The older I got, the more advanced my passion got. In 4th grade, I received a 3d printer. I turned it into a small business, and I sold personalized key fobs to my friends. I improved my 3D printer over the years; for example, I changed the software and bought and built add-ons for it. These thinking habits persisted over the years as I upgraded my room into a smart home, using a Raspberry Pi as the controller, and began studying physics. I developed a strong interest in physics, but others viewed my interest as unconventional because I thought it was one of the most valuable subjects in school.

​

To further improve these skills, I decided to study General Engineering because it offers an opportunity to contribute to society by developing sustainable and efficient solutions that enhance everyday life. In modern society and tech, gaining deeper knowledge is crucial; it's necessary to understand systems, not just isolated aspects. *For instance, when improving a technical system such as a coffee machine*, it is essential to know how one part works and how it affects the overall coffee experience. A comprehensive understanding of both the art of making coffee and the engineering behind its appliances is necessary, even without requiring expertise in unrelated fields. That's why I believe General Engineering, with a particular focus, is a valuable discipline today because it equips us to address complex challenges and enhance our surroundings. Studying engineering will empower me to use this knowledge and thinking to improve personal lives and society as a whole.

​

The school subjects I enjoyed most were Mathematics and Physics. Their clear structure and logical reasoning matched my analytical thinking. In science, having a solid base and applying knowledge to new problems appeals to me. This process is both reasonable and challenges me to think differently.

​

It was in one of my physics exams, where the last task was the hardest: we had to solve a problem in which one light beam was broken through a grid. The task was to find the distance from the centre to these two light beams, which were exactly on top of each other and had the same wavelength, and many students in my course initially believed that information was missing. There wasn't any missing data, so I thought about it a bit longer, but in the end,I realized that several variables cancelled each other out. I was thinking. *I understood the solution*, and it's so nice. When I thought about that problem again after graduating from high school, I decided I wanted to be an engineer.

​

When I decided to upgrade my 3D printer and add some new features, it kept failing on every new print,which led me to question the cause of the failure. I *therefore decided to restart the process from the ground up*. I reflashed the mainboard, reconnected the wires, and didn't touch anything on the base. In the end, it kept failing. After that, failing, I felt very frustrated, so I checked every part; there I found a production fault, and that the wires were good. When I solved it, everything worked in harmony. The same goes when I have absolutely no idea how to do something: I always look for guidance, some spark that gets me to the solution. I also remember one time at a Badminton coaching course, we had the task to build the highest tower only from balloons. The other teams started directly, and our team first thought about the process. I remember seeing nearly all of the other teams trying only with manpower to get higher than themselves,but I suggested to my team that we are in a sports hall.

​

DTU, specializing in Living systems, advanced materials, Cyber systems, and future Energy, gives me the best opportunity to be ready to tackle the problems in the next decades. I personally, who had school during times of AI, know the possibilities and risks Cyber systems can give us, but also create, and for these problems, the DTU undergraduate program would be good at preparing me for them.

​

I am motivated to study at DTU because I admire the Danish way of life, reflected in athletes like Viktor Axelsen and Anders Antonsen. I value project-based learning and group work over purely theoretical study, and DTU offers an environment that supports both. Completing General Engineering would enable me to pursue my career and sporting ambitions in Denmark, a country I see offering long-term growth, innovation, and opportunities. I am excited to bring my passion and problem-solving skills to DTU, confident that this program will equip me to make a lasting contribution to society.

1q4tsbh,https://v.redd.it/i101lsa1qkbg1,"I built a free, open-source VR Mirror Therapy tool to help my partner recover from two strokes, and I want to share it with the community (Web and Private).","Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on, hoping it might help others in this community.

In 2023, my partner suffered two strokes due to an AVM (Arteriovenous Malformation), which resulted in right-side hemiparesis and aphasia. To help with her rehabilitation and neuroplasticity, I initially built her a physical mirror box. However, after researching and talking to therapists, I learned that VR (Virtual Reality) could offer a more immersive and effective experience for **Mirror Therapy**.

Being a developer, I decided to build a tool for her that is accessible to everyone.

**What is it?** It is a **VR Mirror Therapy application** that runs directly in your mobile browser. It uses your phone’s camera to ""flip"" the image of your healthy limb, tricking your brain into thinking the affected limb is moving (pain-free), which helps retrain neural pathways.

**Key Features:**

* **100% Free & Open Source:** I built this to help, not to make money.
* **No Install Needed:** It’s a web app. Just click the link and it works on iOS and Android browsers.
* **Private:** No registration, no login, and no data collection. You just open it and use it.
* **Accessible:** It works with any standard smartphone and cheap VR goggles (the $10 ones you can find on Amazon or AliExpress).
* **Global:** Translated into **50 languages**.

**How to use it:** I’ve made a short video explaining how it works here: 👉 **Demo Video:**[https://youtu.be/JC6Q8dHTTCo](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://youtu.be/JC6Q8dHTTCo)

**Try the App:** You can access the tool here: 🔗[**https://neocodebinary.github.io/vrtherapy/**](https://neocodebinary.github.io/vrtherapy/)

**What's next?** I am currently working on native versions for the **App Store and Google Play** to reach more people (these will also be free). The project has an optional ""Buy me a coffee"" button if anyone wants to support the development, but it is completely optional. The tool is fully functional for free.

I sincerely hope this can help you or your loved ones in their recovery journey. Please let me know if you have any feedback!

  
Special thanks to the moderators for allowing me to post this here. ",5,1767637892.0,OccupationalTherapy,1,1.0,False

1q4ts1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1q4ts1q/help_me_solve_a_norseman_mystery/,Help me solve a Norseman mystery,"So there’s this story from a road trip some friends and I took about 10 years ago and it is so bizarre to me that I still can’t quite make sense of it a decade later. I wanted to share and see if our experience was consistent with anyone else’s, or maybe anyone who has lived in Norseman and can give me some insight. 

So it’s 2016, and two friends and I are driving from Perth to Melbourne. We book a night at the Norseman caravan park to sleep before tackling the Nullarbor plain the next day. Two of us grew up in the southwest of WA and had passed through or stayed in Norseman like 4-5 times each in our respective childhoods, so I had memories of like a high street and a pub and a playground filled with people that do not stick out as unusual in comparison to other small towns we would have stopped at during various camping trips. 

We’re driving down the coolgardie/esperance hwy trying to find our campground which has been mislabelled on Google Maps, so we’re doing laps of the main street trying to find it. It’s right around sunset and the town is completely dead. Not just quiet, it was like everyone heard us coming and hid. It was *eerie.* We drove up and down the town for about 20 minutes and didn’t see another soul. No adults, no kids, no cars driving, no bird noises. Children’s bikes were knocked over in the middle of the footpath, cars were sitting in front yards with all of their doors open and no one inside. We stopped to look at the map outside a house that had half a load of laundry hung up and the other half in a basket, two cups of tea or coffee sitting on a table with a plate of food between them and genuinely no one around. Like everyone was interrupted in the middle of something. I called my parents to ask if I had missed anything in the news that had happened here because we were all so confused.

So we finally find the caravan park, set up our tent and are looking for the toilet block when we walk around the back and find what looks like a deflated circus tent, and a bunch of broken down buses and trucks that all appeared to be for the same circus. We’re even more confused and don’t wanna hang out at the haunted circus caravan park until bed time, so we decide to drive to the Norseman Hotel and treat our frayed nerves to a beer. 

I had thought the “whole crowd goes silent when city slickers enter the country pub” was just a trope but I swear to god when the three of us walked into this pub, everyone stopped their conversations and watched until we sat down. It was completely full of patrons, so I guess we found where everyone was hiding, and they stopped staring after a while. There was a jukebox you could play songs on and on a small tv screen above it, every other song they would play either the music video, or a montage of very plainly written anti-domestic abuse PSAs. They were also plastered all over the bathrooms too. It was like “HITTING YOUR WIFE OR CHILD IS **AGAINST THE LAW**” “ITS A **CRIME** TO PHYSICALLY ABUSE YOUR SPOUSE” “IT DOESN’T MATTER HOW DRUNK YOU ARE, **ITS STILL ABUSE**”. Harrowing. 

There was also this woman. Not someone you would look at twice on the street anywhere else, but she was like the main character of this bar. It was as if there was a spotlight on her at all times. She was just floating around talking to every table in the bar, sitting down to chat for a bit, or pulling people to their feet to dance with them. I looked over at one point and she was slow dancing in place with a person with dwarfism who was standing on a bar stool. Hadn’t even noticed him up til this point. Flame Trees comes on the juke box and she notices me singing the words to my friend and she points at me from across the room and beckons me with her finger. I swear to god, I did not make a cognitive choice to get up, I was pulled across the bar to this woman like a magnet. At the end of the song she leaned into my ear and said “thanks for the dance” in this very high pitched girly voice that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. 

Later that night as we’re trying to fall asleep, I keep waking up my friends because I hear something sniffing around the tent. They tell me to shut the fuck up because it’s probably a possum or a wallaby or a wombat. The next morning as I’m packing up our tent, I scour for animal foot prints and there are none. We left for the Nullarbor just as the sun was rising. 

All of these things on their own are part and parcel of your usual quirky Australian bush town experience. People leave bikes out, everybody needs a PSA, sometimes circuses break down and decide they like the town so much they’ll stay, probably right? I grew up around these weird small town characters, hell - a large chunk of my extended family ARE these weird small town characters. These are subjective things that all likely have separate, rational explanations, and I know that I come off as histrionic or melodramatic, but I cannot stress enough how much my body and mind were on edge the entire time we were there. It was a deep, unsettling feeling that I have only felt a few times in my life. It was so different to every other memory I had of Norseman, but I have not been back there since. Reviews of the Norseman Hotel and the caravan park we stayed in are all very plesant and complimentary. 

I want to know if anyone passing through Norseman has had similar stories. Did anyone live there and knows the history behind the abandoned circus? or the town-wide sunset curfew? Why was the vibe so off on this one night ten years ago??",9,1767637877.0,perth,7,0.91,False

1q4tr8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q4tr8k/aita_for_deciding_to_mostly_cut_off_my_dad/,AITA for deciding to (mostly) cut off my dad.,"Apologies for wall of text, TLDR at the bottom.

Bit of background: My dad has mobility issues due to an artificial hip needing to be replaced.  He has had a few falls in the last couple of months and I have written to the hospital on behalf of my father due to us both feeling stressed, and him getting injured - he is mid 80s - (we're in the UK), and the surgeon offered an appointment which we accepted and went last week.  My dad is also the only member of my family who still talks to me.  I live 80odd miles away so I keep in touch with him by phone *at least* once a week, more if he has had falls or is ill.  My arsehole brother lives 5 minutes away from where my dad does.

So this last episode kicked off with the aforementioned hospital visit.  I drove him to the hospital going the way I would usually go, due to us getting stuck in traffic I wanted to go the motorway to get there faster.  We got there with 10 minutes to go but with him shouting at me while I was driving was making me almost lose control while driving and driving in the hospital but we eventually got a disabled parking bay, and into the hospital we go.

He goes in for an x-ray, while I get coffee and wander around while trying to find him, heh.  Eventually he comes out and we wait for the surgeon.  

We get called in, and we both go into the room to see the surgeon.  We get the surgeon up to  speed with the falls and pain, then get onto the x-ray and other test results with it turning out that the other main reason he hasn't had the surgery, apart from his age, is his lack of diabetes control.  We're both Type 2 - If your parent(s) are diagnosed with Diabetes, get yourself tested regularly kids - and he likes a drink, usually voddie.  

The appointment ends and we go home with dad starting to go off on one about him being able to control his Diabetes (forgetting that tests look over the last couple of months) is great (tests would disagree) and that he can ""stop whenever he likes"" (I would disagree).  And keeps on and on and on.  I try to explain what it means when he's told he has a ""nominated Doctor,"" and that it doesn't mean he will always get to see the nominated Doctor, it just means that any paperwork/test results/medication changes go through them.  He always thinks he knows it all, and always thinks the above with only ever seeing the same doctor all the time.  Which, to be fair, would be nice. (As I have many medical conditions and having one point of contact each time would be great)

We get back to his home and he is still going off on one about it all, we get food in and I go home around 8pm.

I call him on Thursday the 1st of January, 2 days later, to wish him Happy New Year, asking if he is ok, etc..  Of course it is after midday so he is a bit drinked (Remember, he can stop whenever he likes?)  and proceeds to off on one *again*.  And I cannot deal with it any more and hang up on him (not the first time I have done this, or my finest moment).

I've not called him since, nor has he called me.  But I have (mostly) cut off my dad.  I have decided to only call him on Wednesdays, which would normally be the day I call, and ask if he is ok.  

If he says ""Yes,"" I will then say ""I'm glad,"" saying ""Goodbye,"" then ending the call.

or 

If he says ""No,"" I will tell him to get his other son who lives 5 minutes away to help as I am fed up with listening to it all the time.

I feel guilty already and it's not been a week yet.  AITA/WIBTA for doing this?

TLDR: Elderly dad is doing my head in because he hasn't had his hip replacement replaced (it's been 30 odd years), and gets uptight when you try to explain how things work with GPs, or how things are when they look at test results as he knows how it all works and he can do it all in a heartbeat.  Does my head in and I hang up (for the 2nd time) and want to go with the bit just above the TLDR.",1,1767637830.0,AITAH,2,0.57,False

I am looking for some advice on print settings and material for printing a replacement gear on my coffee grinder. 

I have an X1C and have .2, .4 and .6 nozzles.  I am unsure which one would lead to a more durable print.  I think the recommendation is to print using PA12, but I am unsure what settings are optimal for printing gears, or if PA12 is suitable to use inside a coffee grinder.

I am aware that the PA12 material should be used right out of the filament dryer and that I should have a very high bed temperature.

Any advice for gear printing is greatly appreciated!",1,1767637707.0,3Dprinting,2,1.0,False

Hi Reddit 👋

I’m 24F, an IT professional surviving on deadlines, Wi-Fi, and coffee ☕️💻. I’m calm, friendly, and I strongly believe dishes should not turn into archaeological discoveries in the sink 🫣🍽️. I respect personal space and prefer a peaceful, drama-free home after work.

Yes!,"TLDR Review: these had a great blend of an almost cornbread like flavor to the pancakes with a nice crunchy texture from the topping, a little savory from the cream cheese and melted butter and tons of sweetness from the sugar, cinnamon base and syrup. Paired really well with coffee naturally. Bummed this just left the menu, I swear I saw it when I looked yesterday ",1,1767637492.0,IHOP,2,1.0,False
1q4tl2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/playadelcarmen/comments/1q4tl2a/not_coming_back_to_playa_del_carmen/,Not coming back to Playa del Carmen,"Spent 2 weeks in Playa del Carmen and I had enough for a lifetime. I haven’t felt more dehumanized by locals in any other place on the planet and I traveled a lot. People here think Americans are walking dollar pinatas. I had to hustle for everything: taxis (especially), coconuts, simple garments, jet skis, etc. “It’s Christmas Day, prices are double”, so I walked to another taxi to re-negotiate, and the first driver literally walked next to me and told whoever I was talking to, not to lower the price. It happened again on Jan 1st. Few people can take an order properly: “I’m allergic to X”, and the food will come with X; “I want a hot coffee”, and a large will come; ""I want a mezcal"", and a regular Tequila will be served. And everyone expects tips, even when I was served a rotten salad - literally. The people here are desensitized and they simply don’t care. It doesn’t matter if the service is garbage, another dumb American with money will come and pay. It’s ok. After 20 years of traveling, the closest experience came in the very touristy parts of Italy where the attitude towards tourists was similar. Back in February I traveled to Mexico City and the experience was flipped: amazing service, amazing food and the locals didn’t have a FU attitude. The locals in Playa del Carmen really need to be careful: we are all a reflection of the world; if you treat people like crap, they will treat you back the same way. I wasn’t nice to people by the end of my vacation. For the record, I do need to mention that many locals are decent and nature is so incredibly beautiful. Also, for the record, I didn’t grow up in the US and I see the world through a different lens, but Playa del Carmen really takes the cake.",17,1767637464.0,playadelcarmen,66,0.66,False
