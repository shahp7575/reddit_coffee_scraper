Looking for clarity and tools to help me cope in a healthier way.,"I’m (63 F)and my husband (62M) have been married for 15 years. We were both newly divorced from long, unhappy marriages when we got together. Our five kids (3 mine, 2 his) were already young adults at the time, ranging from 18 to 28.

We’ve never had a super blended family, mainly because the three older kids were already living on their own working and going to college.

My husband has a large extended family and they’re very close. In the beginning, they were fairly accepting of me, but over time that seems to have changed. I know I’m not for everyone, and I also have social anxiety, especially at all their large family gatherings.

My husband’s ex-wife is still considered part of the family. I’ve always thought that was actually pretty cool, since they have such a long history with her. On my side, both of my parents have passed and I’m an only child, so I’m pretty alone in that sense. My ex-husband’s family is sadly very fractured, and I’m not in touch with any of them beyond the occasional phone call. I’m on good terms with my ex and his new wife, but we don’t socialize.

The issue is that I’m excluded from a lot of things.

For example, my stepson got engaged and my husband never mentioned it to me.  While at a family party I asked my stepson if he and his new GF were considering marriage and he said we got engaged three months ago. Where have you been and she showed me her massive diamond ring, which I  crazily never noticed. When I asked my husband, he said he forgot to tell me.

My stepson’s fiancée is lovely and she loves to entertain. There seems to be some kind of celebration every few weeks—birthdays her kids, my step-grandkids, her parents, etc. my husband also has a cousin who is the same way. I’ve been to more graduations, baby showers, wedding showers weddings for this adjacent family than I have for my own kids.

I try to attend as much as I can, but sometimes I check out. The parties last for hours, there’s a lot of drinking, and the family is very into a particular pro sports team. Almost every weekend there’s a watch party. I enjoy going occasionally, but I get overwhelmed by the drinking, the banter, and constant football talk.

I might add here, my petty feeling is that no one in is this cohort ever asks about my kids, or grandkids. Maybe my husband  shares news about my family but I can’t remember a moment when anyone in his family asked how anyone is doing regarding my family.  I feel like

a non entity.

The most recent thing was that my stepson got a private suite at the local stadium to watch an NFL game. I know that isn’t cheap, and I kind of understand why I wasn’t included since I’m not a super fan. Still, I’ve been to plenty of games and I enjoy the experience. The outing lasted from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and included pregaming and cocktails afterward. My husband is four years sober and was the designated driver.

The group was my stepson, his fiancée, my stepdaughter, her boyfriend, my husband, and his ex-wife. Okay. I get it. The ex-wife is a die-hard fan, and my stepson’s wanted his mom and dad there.

I told my husband that I felt excluded again, but also said I understand that this is just how the family dynamic works. Husband just said sorry my feelings were hurt.

Then Christmas came and went. I spent it with my kids, while he went to his son’s house with their big family. When he came home, he started showing me all the gifts his kids gave him—an expensive sweater, shoes, clothes, tools. One of the gifts was a picture calendar, with the cover featuring the pregame photo of the husband, ex-wife, two kids and their partners at the NFL game. To be fair, I did make the cut in one of the monthly photos—a picture of me and my husband from our wedding—which was thoughtful.

My husband also handed me my the gift from his kids, a coffee mug that says “Cat Mom.” It’s nice, I guess. Who doesn’t love a good mug? We share a cat but I’m really not a cat person although his kids don’t really know me well enough to know that.

I know this is long, and I know I’m probably too damn old to be feeling hurt, annoyed, and petty—but here I am.

This is an ongoing issue, and I don’t really want to talk to my husband about it anymore. There’s nothing he can realistically do. He can’t control his kids or force them to acknowledge my existence.  No one is being cruel to me or anything, I just feel like I’m an adjacent entity.

I’m really looking for some clarity, validation, and maybe a healthier way to approach this for my own mental health. Thanks and wishing people a happy healthy 2026

\*\*TL;DR\*\*  I am feeling excluded from my husband’s family, and I just would like some clarity and tools to help me cope in a healthier way. .",1,1767291452.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

1q1as6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q1as6z/ex_says_she_still_loves_me_reconnects_intimately/,"Ex says she still loves me, reconnects intimately, but says God is telling her to move on","My ex and I are both women. We were together for 3 years, shared a home, raised kids, and built a real life together. It’s been 3 months since the breakup and 2 months since she moved out.

She said she felt neglected for approx a year due to the chaos and routines of our lives and she felt so closed off. was more about fear, emotional patterns, and her feeling like she needed to “find herself.”

After she moved out, we had limited contact. The longest no contact I managed was about 10 days. She broke it by texting “Merry Christmas.” A few days later, I reached out again, and she came over.

We talked for hours, cried, made love, said “I love you,” and she stayed the night. The next day we met for coffee, held hands, kissed, and talked like nothing had changed. She told me her love for me never disappeared and that our connection feels “timeless.” She says it’s a “hard pill to swallow that no one will ever love her or see her like I do.”

Then she shut down again.

She says she doesn’t want to go backward and believes God is telling her to move forward — even though she admits she isn’t afraid to try again. She just doesn’t want to. Since the breakup, she’s leaned much more heavily into religion and now believes God is giving her signs to explore a connection with a male friend she had previously friend-zoned — despite what she feels for me. 

She still has things at the house, says she’ll come get them and doesn’t, wants to stay “best friends,” and even said she had to force herself to leave because she knew she would just stay otherwise.

I feel stuck in this awful place where I’m loved but not chosen.

Has anyone experienced an ex who says they still love you, reconnects emotionally and physically, but refuses to choose you — especially when religion or “divine signs” are involved? Did clarity ever come, or is this something I need to walk away from? I am pretty versed in the importance of “no contact.”

1q1aq65,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1aq65,Advice needed: Managing long-term care for a senior indie dog as a student 🐶,"Hi everyone,

I’m writing this post to genuinely seek guidance and understand the community’s perspective.

I’m a student currently juggling exams, studies, and mental exhaustion, and alongside that, I’m responsible for Coffee, whose story I had shared here earlier. This is not a donation or fundraising post. I’m here to learn from people who’ve been in similar situations.

A brief update on Coffee:

Coffee is 13-year-old indie dog and no longer fit to survive on the streets. He’s currently at a safe place and under good care at Paws and Pause. He has joint issues, and earlier had a few lumps, which have reduced to some extent with treatment. Given his age and condition, relocating him isn’t something I’m considering unless there’s a clearly better and ethical option.

Coffee was an unexpected case of an old, injured dog I found on the street. If I hadn’t moved him to proper care and treatment at that time, he probably wouldn’t have survived. I managed his expenses fully for the first couple of months, knowing it wouldn’t be easy to sustain long-term, especially since I also support community dogs back home through feeding, sterilisation, and emergencies, while staying away for my studies.

At present, Coffee’s care involves a fixed monthly cost for boarding and treatment, with fewer vet visits now as he has improved. I’m able to contribute only a part of this consistently on my own, and I’m trying to figure out responsible, sustainable ways to manage the rest so he doesn’t end up back on the streets again. He’s old, but incredibly sweet and resilient.

For transparency and peace of mind, Coffee’s caretaker has created a small group called “Coffee’s Diary”, where regular updates are shared in morning, afternoon, and evening routines, physiotherapy, infrared therapy, three-time meals (which have helped him gain weight), along with updates on joint supplements, medicines, and his recovery from lumps. All this totals cost 5k-7k. Out of this I was only able to manage 2k on my own. Coffee is already on a very discounted price as a student I requested them before admitting to the coffee there. 

I did try platforms like Patreon or Buy Me a Coffee after suggestions from the IndieDogs moderators so that Coffee could receive consistent monthly support, It didn’t receive much response, almost flat. That’s why I wanted to ask this community: what ethical, practical options or approaches have worked for you? I’m genuinely open to ideas and experiences. I truly don’t want Coffee to be back on the streets.  As its emotionally and financially exhausting for me.  But i don't want coffee ot be back on the streets again. 

This isn’t an appeal for donations; just an attempt to find sustainable options while managing academic stress and responsibilities. And while adoption of an older indie dog is rare, I wanted to mention it here with honesty and hope. 

I’d really appreciate any guidance or perspective. Thank you for reading. 🙏🐾",5,1767291161.0,Indiedogs,3,1.0,False

I am really afraid of labour and healing process afterwards.

1q1aon6,https://i.redd.it/if9x7b1o3sag1.jpeg,Five Nights at Freddy 2 Rewritten Chapter 3,"Scene: School of Nightmares

The fluorescent lights of the science lab hummed with a sterile energy as Mr. Berg paced the aisles. On the chalkboard, the words SCIENCE FAIR: THIS SATURDAY were written in bold, aggressive strokes.
""Remember, class,"" Mr. Berg droned, adjusting his glasses. ""We are looking for innovation. For normality. For projects that represent the bright future of this town.""
The room was a chaos of typical middle-school projects—baking soda volcanoes, potato batteries, and simple coding programs. But in the back corner, Abby and Gregory sat huddled over a cluttered workbench. 

They were the outliers. Gregory, with his uncanny knack for gears and wiring, was soldering the endoskeleton of a miniature Freddy Fazbear. Beside him, Abby was carefully applying a coat of yellow paint to a small, hand-sculpted Chica.

""Look at the freaks,"" Delilah whispered from the next table. She leaned over, chewing her gum loudly, and with a casual flick of her fingers, spat a wet glob of blue bubblegum directly into Abby’s hair.

Abby flinched, her hand slipping and smearing yellow paint across Chica’s bib. ""Stop it, Delilah,"" she mumbled, her bottom lip trembling.

""Why?"" Frank chimed in, leaning over from the other side. ""It's not like that piece of junk is going to work anyway."" He tipped his cup, pouring a steady stream of ice-cold water over Gregory’s circuit boards.
Sizzle.

Gregory’s jaw tightened. He didn't look up, but his hands were shaking as he wiped the water away. ""It’s better than your volcano, Frank. At least this requires an IQ higher than room temperature.""

Mr. Berg drifted over, his shadow looming over their desk. He didn't scold Delilah or Frank. Instead, he looked at their projects with a thin, condescending smile. ""You know, Gregory... Abby... maybe this isn't the right venue for... this."" He gestured vaguely at their work. 

""People are already talking about FazFest. They want to move on from those old ghost stories. Talking to plushies at night, drawing those... disturbing pictures... It's not healthy. Maybe you two should sit this fair out. For your own sake.""

The class erupted in snickers. ""Yeah, go play with your dolls, weirdos!"" someone shouted.
""They're not dolls!"" Gregory snapped, standing up. ""They're more advanced than anything you've ever built! Leave her alone!""
Mr. Berg’s smile didn't falter, but his eyes turned cold. ""Careful, Gregory. Accidents happen in busy labs.""

As Mr. Berg turned to walk away, his hip ""accidentally"" slammed into the corner of their workbench. With a violent lurch, both the miniature Freddy and Chica were sent flying. They hit the linoleum floor with a sickening crack of plastic and the snap of delicate copper wiring.

Abby stared at the shattered remains of her Chica. The paint was still wet, smearing against the floor like a bruise. She looked at Mr. Berg, who was already pretending to be shocked, but the smirk in his reflection in the glass cabinet gave him away.

A choked sob escaped Abby’s throat. She didn't say a word; she simply turned and bolted out of the classroom, her footsteps echoing down the hallway.

Gregory stood alone amidst the laughter of his peers. He knelt down, his fingers brushing the snapped neck of his Freddy. The damage was total—the gears were stripped, the processor cracked. He looked at the door where Abby had disappeared, then back at the smirking Mr. Berg.

In that moment, the fascination Gregory had for machinery began to twist into something darker—a realization that the world didn't deserve the things they built.

Mr. Berg didn't even look down at the wreckage. He simply adjusted his tie and leaned in close to Gregory, his voice dropping to a low, venomous hiss that the rest of the class couldn't hear.

""And Gregory? Do me a favor,"" Berg whispered. ""Tell your little friend that if either of you shows your face at that fair on Saturday, I’m giving you both a big, fat F. I don’t care if those toys start dancing and singing the national anthem. You’re failing my class.""

Gregory’s eyes snapped up, flashing with a sudden, sharp defiance. He raised a finger, pointing it directly at the teacher's chest. ""You can't do that. You don't have the power to fail us just because you don't like our projects. If you threaten us like that, the school board will have your job. No teacher is allowed to manipulate grades based on a personal grudge. You'll be fired before the fair even starts.""

The classroom went dead silent. The other students stopped laughing, shocked that the ""weird kid"" was actually fighting back.
Mr. Berg’s face turned a deep, blotchy purple. He leaned in even closer, his shadow completely swallowing Gregory. ""You think you’re so smart, don’t you? You think those rules protect you?""

He let out a short, dry chuckle that held no humor. ""I’ve been at this school for twenty years, Gregory. I know the principal. I know the board. If I want you gone, you’re gone. I can make up anything I want—academic dishonesty, threatening a teacher, theft of lab equipment. I will destroy your record and ensure you and Abby are expelled before the week is out. I’ll do whatever is necessary to get rid of you two freaks.""

Gregory’s hand trembled, his finger slowly dropping. He looked around the room—at the smirking Frank, the sneering Delilah, and the cold, immovable wall of authority standing in front of him. He realized he wasn't just fighting a mean teacher; he was fighting a system that hated him.

Gregory groaned, his jaw clenching so hard it ached. He shut his mouth, swallowed his rage, and began to silently pick up the broken pieces of his animatronic, his heart hardening into a cold, heavy stone.

Scene: Toys in The Dark
In Mike’s House, in the quiet suburbs felt like stepping into a different world, though for Abby, the ghosts were still there—they were just smaller now.

Her bedroom was a shrine to the memories of the previous year. Plushies of Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy sat in a neat row on her bed, their button eyes reflecting the dim glow of her desk lamp. 

On the walls, her drawings—once frantic and dark—had become softer, though they still depicted the towering figures she had called her friends.

""Freddy?"" she whispered, leaning in close to the bear’s fuzzy ear. ""Are you in there? Can you hear me?""

Silence. Not even a mechanical hum. She turned to Bonnie, nudging his plush arm. ""Bonnie? It’s me, Abby. I miss the songs. Foxy? Chica…?!""
The toys remained lifeless. Abby pouted, her shoulders sagging. The magical spark that had once animated the giants at the old restaurant felt millions of miles away.

A soft knock at the door made her jump. Mike leaned against the frame, looking exhausted but wearing a gentle expression. ""Still trying to get a word out of them?""
Abby sighed, clutching the Freddy plush to her chest. ""I’ve been so unlucky, Mike. They won't talk. Not even a little.""

Mike walked over and sat on the edge of the bed. He looked at the drawings on the wall—reminders of the horror he had barely survived. He didn't want to tell her that the spirits were trapped in a cycle of vengeance; he wanted her to have peace.

""Abby,"" he said softly, ""they’re in a better place now. In Heaven. Even if they were still at the old place... well, the building collapsed. They’re likely broken, resting. It’s okay to let them go.""

Tears welled in Abby’s eyes. She buried her face in the plush Freddy’s hat, the fabric smelling of home and laundry detergent. She nodded slowly, forcing herself to accept the silence of the room.

""Hey,"" Mike said, ruffling her hair. ""I have to head out for a bit. I’m meeting Vanessa tonight. Will you be okay for a few hours?""
""Yeah,"" she mumbled. ""I have my drawings.""
As Mike’s car pulled out of the driveway, Abby turned back to her desk. Her eyes landed on a specific drawing—one that didn't come from her own hand. It was a gift from Gregory, the only boy at school who didn't look at her like she was a freak. The teachers were harsh, and the other kids were mean, but Gregory understood.

The drawing showed the three of them: Abby, Gregory, and a big, friendly Freddy Fazbear holding hands. It made her heart feel a little less heavy.

Then she remembered the Science Fair.
The pang of anxiety hit her stomach. Every other kid had a volcano or a solar system, but the prompt was Robotics. Abby knew what robots looked like, she knew how they moved, but she had no idea how to build one from wires and batteries. 

Gregory had been struggling too; he had left school earlier that day, looking determined but stressed, saying he was going to head home to ""find a solution.""

Restless and unable to sit in the quiet house any longer, Abby grabbed her jacket. She knew where Gregory lived—just a few blocks away near the local shopping strip.

The sun had dipped below the horizon, staining the sky a bruised purple. As Abby walked down the sidewalk, the streetlights flickering to life, she spotted a familiar hoodie across the street.

""Gregory!"" she called out.

The boy stopped and turned. He looked surprised to see her out so late. ""Abby? What are you doing out?""

""Thinking about the fair,"" she said, catching up to him. ""I don't have a robot, Gregory. I'm going to fail.""

Gregory looked toward the end of the block, where the neon sign of a local hobby and toy store buzzed. ""Me neither. But I’m going to go buy one. A kit, or a toy I can take apart. My dad says it’s cheating, but I don't care. I just want to finish it.""

The two of them stood under the streetlamp, two lonely kids looking for a spark of the mechanical magic they both felt drawn to.
Gregory stared at the price tags in the window of Hobby Haven, his face falling. Three dollars. That was all he had scraped together from under couch cushions and his bedside table. It wasn't enough for a robot; it wasn't even enough for a pack of batteries.

""It’s no use,"" Gregory muttered as they stepped away from the glass. ""We’re going to fail.""

As they turned to head back into the darkness of the sidewalk, a hum vibrated through the pavement. From the shadows of an alleyway adjacent to the shop, two brilliant, glowing blue circles ignited.

Abby froze. Gregory gasped, stumbling back as a massive, polished figure stepped into the light of the streetlamp. It was Freddy—but not the matted, brown bear Abby knew. This one was sleek, made of a hard, reflective plastic, with bright red cheeks and a jaunty top hat that looked brand new.

""Gregory, what's the matter?"" Abby asked, but then she saw him too. Her eyes widened, not with fear, but with a sudden, desperate hope. 

""Freddy?""

The animatronic tilted its head. To Gregory’s shock, the jaw moved with fluid, silent precision. A voice, crisp and cheerful like a Saturday morning cartoon, emanated from its chest.

""Why, hello there, kiddo! You shouldn't be up this late! It’s way past your bedtime!""
Gregory’s jaw dropped. ""No way... is that a guy in a suit?""

But Abby didn't care. She saw the bow tie and the ears and she saw a friend. She ran forward, throwing her arms around the bear’s waist. ""Freddy! You’re back!""

Toy Freddy’s internal servos whirred. He didn't push her away; instead, his thick plastic arms moved with surprising gentleness, hugging her back. Over her shoulder, his glowing blue eyes locked onto Gregory with a gaze that felt unnervingly intelligent.

""N-no way…Are you... are you a real robot?"" Gregory asked, stepping closer, his scientific curiosity finally outweighing his fear. ""Like, fully autonomous?""

Toy Freddy blinked, his eyelids clicking. ""Yes! I am a state-of-the-art animatronic performer, designed for maximum fun and safety!""

Gregory had one more thing to try. “Prove it!” Toy Freddy blinked again before grabbing his own head, twisting it, and pops it off. Toy Freddy is still alive despite decapitating himself. “Are you satisfied, Superstar?” Gregory gulps and nods yes. Toy Freddy reattached his head.

Gregory’s face transformed. This was it. The ultimate project. ""Will you be our science fair project? Please? We need to show them something that works, and you're the coolest thing I've ever seen!""

""A performance for a young scholar?"" Toy Freddy patted his stomach. ""I would be honored to assist in your academic endeavors!"" Just then, Toy Freddy’s friends soon arrive. Toy Bonnie, Toy Foxy, Toy Chica, Toy Cupcake, Toy Mangle, Balloon Boy, JJ, Toy Paxton. Abby saw Toy Chica and ran up and hugged her. Toy Chica shakes a little as she hugged Abby back.

The excitement lasted for about ten seconds before Gregory looked at Toy Freddy’s heavy, piston-driven legs. ""Wait. You move too slow. We'll never get to the school gym on time, and you're way too big to hide in a wagon.""

Abby pulled back, a mischievous glint in her eyes. ""I know how to get around.""

Five minutes later, a yellow taxi pulled to the curb, its tires screeching. The driver—a man everyone called Cabbie—rolled down the window to check his fare. He looked at Abby, and his face instantly paled. 

He remembered her. He remembered the night at the old pizzeria, the strange noises, and the way the air seemed to curdle around that family.

""You,"" Cabbie hissed, pointing a finger at Abby. ""No. No way. Out! Both of you, get away from my cab right now!""

""Please!"" Gregory cried, reaching for the door handle. ""We’re in a hurry!""

“You better not have that freaky yellow Bear thing again!” Before Cabbie could put the car in gear, the entire frame of the taxi groaned and tilted dangerously to one side. 

The suspension screamed as Toy Freddy ducked his head and forced his massive, plastic bulk into the backseat. The car bounced on its shocks, the tires nearly touching the wheel wells.
Cabbie looked into his rearview mirror, his eyes bulging. ""WHAT IN THE—""

He let out a blood-curdling scream. In the struggle to get into the seat, Toy Freddy’s optical sensors had been jarred loose. They had popped out of their sockets, dangling by thin silver wires, leaving two gaping, pitch-black holes in the bear's face.

""Oh! My goodness!"" Cabbie shrieked, clutching his heart.

""It's okay!"" Gregory said quickly, reaching up and catching the glowing blue orbs. He carefully pressed them back into the sockets until they clicked. ""They just fell out! See? Good as new.""
Toy Freddy adjusted his hat, which had been crushed against the roof of the car. ""Thank you, small friend. My apologies for the fright, Mr. Driver. My maintenance schedule is slightly overdue.""

Cabbie stared at the mirror, his hands shaking so hard he could barely grip the steering wheel. He looked at the black-eyed void that had briefly replaced the bear's gaze, then at Abby's calm face.

""Just... just tell me where we're going,"" Cabbie whispered, stepping on the gas before he could change his mind. Abby screams out. “Wait! What about the others?” Toy Chica stares at them in the window. “I’ll catch up, friends! You can leave without me!” 

Abby waves goodbye to Chica as Cabbie drives off. Toy Bonnie, Toy Foxy, Balloon Boy, JJ, Toy Mangle, and Toy Paxton walk off and adventure off into the city with Toy Chica going towards the school. 

Scene: Mike and Vanessa’s Date

The candle on the table flickered, casting long, dancing shadows against the restaurant walls. Mike reached across the white linen, placing his hand over Vanessa’s. She looked better than she did in the hospital, but her eyes were still haunted—wide and restless, as if she were constantly checking the exits.

""How have you been, really?"" Mike asked softly. ""Since the coma. Since everything.""

Vanessa’s hand trembled under his. She took a slow, jagged breath. ""It’s been awful, Mike. I thought waking up would be the end of it, but the nightmares... they’ve just changed shape. I’m a child again in them. I’m back in that house.""
She looked down at her water glass, her voice dropping to a whisper. ""I see him. My father.

He’s always in that yellow suit, prowling the hallways. I’m small, clutching a plastic flashlight like it’s a sword. If I don't flash it at his eyes the moment he rounds the corner, he gets closer. He never stops coming.""

She shivered, her mind racing back to the most recent dream. ""The last one... I found his workshop. It was filled with things that haven't been finished yet. Sleek, white-and-pink versions of them. There was a bear—Funtime Freddy—with a small blue rabbit sitting on a table next to him. Funtime Foxy, Funtime Chica... even a strange, multi-limbed thing called Music Man. And then a creepy large blue ballerina thing laying near a table.”

Vanessa wiped a stray tear. ""They were hollow. Missing their shells. I saw blueprints for smaller things—Minireenas and BidyBabs—strewn across a desk near a ballerina puppet. I was so focused on the blueprints that I didn't hear him. The breathing. That heavy, wet sound behind the mask.""

""I crawled backward, trying to hide,"" she continued, her voice breaking. ""And I bumped into her. Circus Baby. She was massive, unmoving... until I touched her. Her eyes snapped open. She didn't scream; she just watched me. And then he was there. The knife. The pain.""

Vanessa’s shoulders shook as she began to cry. Mike immediately stood, moving to the seat beside her and pulling her into a grounding embrace.

""Hey, hey. You're here. You're safe,"" Mike murmured, his voice firm. ""You don't have to talk about him anymore. Not tonight.""

After a few minutes, Vanessa pulled back, dabbing her eyes with a napkin. She tried to force a professional mask back on. ""I'm sorry. I think... I think I have to retire from the force, Mike. The trauma is too much. I can't protect a city when I can't even feel safe in my own head. I need therapy. Real therapy.""

Mike nodded understandingly. ""That’s probably for the best. Take the time you need.""

Vanessa needs to make note of something important. “Mike, for future reference. I have a brother named Michael. And there’s another Freddy’s somewhere.” Mike’s eyes snap open. “I think it’s best I tell you now…I haven’t seen him or heard of that restaurant in a long time.” 

Mike sighs but calms down. “It’s alright, Vanessa. As long as there’s no reason to go back. Nothing bad is going to happen. Thank you for telling me. Your brother most likely started a family and is successful. Not even thinking about his family.” 

Vanessa calms down after Mike assured her nothing is wrong. “And how is Abby?"" Vanessa asked, desperate to change the subject.

Mike sighed, leaning back. ""It’s tough. She’s struggling. The kids at school... they’re cruel. They treat her like an outsider. She’s tried faking sick just to stay home. My construction job keeps us afloat, and I’m there as much as I can be, but I’m worried. I might have to move her to a different district.""

He looked into his coffee, his expression darkening. ""There’s only one kid who treats her like a human being—a boy named Gregory. But even with him around, she still goes into her room and talks to those plushies. She thinks they're still there. I told her they’re gone, that the old place collapsed and they're broken, but she won't let go.""

Vanessa’s mind raced a bit and she clutched her chest in pain for a bit. “Hey? Hey!” Mike reached out. “I need to go to the bathroom, Mike…” Vanessa quickly rushes to the bathroom. 

Vanessa splashed cold water on her face, but it felt like ice against her skin. She gripped the edges of the porcelain sink, her knuckles white. In, out. In, out. 

She looked up into the mirror, and for a second, the reflection didn’t belong to her. The air in the small bathroom grew heavy, smelling of mothballs and copper. Behind her own heavy breathing, she heard it—the rhythmic, wet rasp of a respirator through a mask.

Thump. Thump. Thump.

The footsteps were heavy, echoing not in the room, but inside her skull. Suddenly, the mirror began to cloud with a dark, viscous red. Letters smeared across the glass, jagged and panicked: YOU CAN’T!!!

The screams of the children she couldn’t save—the ones she had watched her father lead away, the five children, Abby’s ghostly friends—erupted in a deafening chorus. In the corner of her eye, a flash of yellow fur and a stitched, smiling face appeared right behind her shoulder.

Vanessa let out a strangled cry and collapsed to her knees, curling into a ball as the world spun into a dizzying panic attack.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

""Vanessa? Are you okay?"" Mike’s voice thundered from the other side of the door.
""STAY AWAY FROM ME!"" she shrieked, her voice raw.

Mike didn't wait. He kicked the door open, his face twisted in horror. He saw her shivering on the floor and immediately knelt, grabbing her shoulders and shaking her gently. 

""Vanessa! Look at me! He’s not here! It’s just us!""
Her eyes snapped into focus, the hallucinations dissolving into the drab wallpaper of the restaurant. She lunged forward, sobbing into Mike’s chest.

The drive was silent. Vanessa had cried herself into an exhausted sleep, her head resting against the passenger window. Mike gripped the steering wheel, his eyes scanning the road. As he passed a dark intersection, he caught a glimpse of movement on the sidewalk.

Three tall, plastic figures—one blue, one red—seemed to be walking with a stiff, mechanical gait toward the residential district. Balloon Boy, Toy Bonnie and Toy Foxy. Mike slammed on the brakes, the tires chirping.

He leaned out the window, looking back, but the street was empty. Only the flickering orange glow of a streetlamp remained. He rubbed his eyes, his heart hammering. ""Get it together, Mike. You’re seeing ghosts everywhere.""

He dropped Vanessa off at her house, making sure she was locked inside safely, before racing back home. Once she gets in her bedroom, Vanessa looks at her old cop uniform and then finds a picture of her crew with a police dog and her police chief. Vanessa sleeps for a long time afterwards

Scene: Broken Family. 

Mike arrives at his house and enters, expecting Abby to be inside. The house was too quiet.

""Abby?"" he called out, his voice echoing in the hallway. ""Abby, I'm home!”

No answer. He checked her room. The bed was made, but her backpack was gone. He stepped into the center of the room and felt something soft under his boot. Crunch. He looked down. He had stepped on her Freddy plush. 

A voice box inside, jarred by the pressure, let out a distorted, tinny line: ""I'll... always... be... your... friend...""

Mike felt a cold pit form in his stomach. He hurried to the front door and saw a piece of notebook paper taped to the wood.

> Went to Gregory’s! Want to find a robot for a science project. Maybe, I’ll see my friends again! - Abby

""You've gotta be kidding me..."" Mike groaned, his hand over his face. Mike gives the Freddy plush a slight kick. It starts going “Hur, Hur, Hur, Hur, Hur, Hur, Hur, Hur, Hur, Hur.”

Mike didn't go to Gregory's. He knew where his sister’s ""friends"" lived. Mike went to the Classic version of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza and found it to be a huge mess. Not a single animatronic in sight. Only a mess of building construction is coming down. Mike spends minutes searching for Abby. Calling out for her. Nothing. 

Mike then leaves, but steps on a drawing and a poster showcasing the Toy Animatronics and a drawing of Balloon Boy. Mike remembers Vanessa mentioning another Freddy’s and assumes Abby might’ve fled there since it’s near. “Please, Abby, tell me you’ve went to Gregory’s or at least your school…”

He sped toward Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza JRs, skidding into the parking lot. He ran through the open double doors, finding the main hall a disaster zone—blood, broken glass, and signs of a struggle.

He followed the faint sound of a melody down to the basement.

There, standing over the massive, empty Music Box, were two people he didn't recognize. An older man with graying hair and a weary face, and a young girl who looked like she had been crying for hours.

""Charlotte, please,"" the man was saying. ""We’ll find him.""

""Who are you?"" Mike demanded, his hand on his flashlight like a weapon.

The man jumped, shielding the girl. ""I should ask you the same thing! I’m Henry…Henry Emily. Someone let the Marionette out. My daughter... she has a connection to it.""

Mike lowered his guard slightly. ""I'm Mike Schmidt. I’m looking for my sister. She thinks this place is a playground.""

Henry looked at the empty box, his eyes filled with a decades-old pain. ""You shouldn't have come here, Mike. Charlotte talks to that thing because it holds the spirit of her brother... my son, Sammy. I saw him getting into a car in front of my house…”

Henry’s voice shook. ""He was taken from this very restaurant years ago. I saw it on the tapes. A man in a Yellow Rabbit suit. Afton... he played it off like a stranger did it. I’ve spent my life trying to prove it was him.""

The fluorescent lights in the basement of JR’s Pizzeria flickered with a sickly hum, smelling of stagnant water and old grease. 
Mike had followed the sound of a rhythmic clinking, thinking he’d find a squatter or a thief. Instead, he found a man huddled over a workbench and a little girl, around Gregory and Abby’s age, sitting on a crate, her eyes wide with a heavy, adult sadness.
""Please tell me everything…"" Mike demanded, his flashlight beam cutting through the gloom.

The man stood up, his face lined with years of exhaustion. This was Henry Emily. Beside him, Charlotte gripped the edges of her crate, her knuckles white.

""Very well, Mike"" Henry said softly.

Scene: The Shadow of the Rabbit

Henry pulled a stool toward Mike, the metal legs scraping harshly against the concrete. ""I wasn't always a man chasing ghosts. I was a partner. A builder. William Afton and I... we were the kings of Fredbear’s Family Diner.""
As Henry spoke, he laid out a series of tattered photos on the workbench. Mike saw the original stage. Henry was in a golden Freddy suit, laughing with children. But next to him stood the Yellow Rabbit.

""William didn't perform like me,"" Henry whispered. ""He would stand perfectly still for minutes, his head tilted at an angle that wasn't human. He’d stare—just blank, unblinking stares—at the children or at me, never responding to the cues. He was a shadow in a room full of light.""

Henry explained how William kept his workshop under a literal lock and key, threatening Henry with ""unfortunate accidents"" if he ever pried. But the tension reached a breaking point when William broke into Henry's private office. He found Henry's secret plans for Chica’s Party World—blueprints for a purple hippo, a banjo-playing pig, and the centerpiece, Partytime Chica.

""I was going to leave him,"" Henry admitted, his voice trembling. ""My wife gave me the idea. She believed Chica was the soul of the place, the one always overlooked. I wanted to start fresh. William found my goodbye letters and my designs for a black bear named Lefty. He saw it as a betrayal. He didn't just want a business; he wanted to own me.""

The Music Box and the Newspaper
Henry reached into a toolbox and pulled out a small, ornate music box. He wound the key, and a soft, haunting lullaby drifted through the damp basement.

""My son, Sammy... he's gone, Mike. Stuck in the walls of this very franchise. This music is the only thing that calms him when he’s upset. We need to find him and play this. It's the only way to stop the rage.""

Mike leaned against the cold brick wall, his chest tight. ""I know what happened to Afton. He went back to the old place, got caught in a springlock suit, and died. He’s a corpse in a basement now.""

""But he didn't die alone,"" Henry said, his voice dropping to a pained whisper. He reached into his coat and pulled out a yellowed newspaper clipping. He handed it to Mike.

The headline was about ""A Boy’s Demise"" but the grainy photo was what destroyed Mike's composure. It showed the Puppet—the machine built as a security system—cradling a small, limp body at Freddy’s JRs on the main stage.

""He had a friend by his side"" Henry asked. ""I don’t know his name.""

Mike took the paper, his hands shaking so violently the edges crinkled. He stared at the striped shirt, the familiar messy hair of his little brother. The tears he’d spent years suppressing finally spilled over, hot and stinging.

""G-Garrett…He brought him there,"" Mike choked out, his knees nearly giving way. ""Afton took him to the one place I never guessed to look... he brought him to Freddy's just to kill him.""

The truth was a physical weight in the room. The ""Yellow Rabbit"" hadn't just been a suit; it was a reaper. And the Puppet hadn't been attacking Garrett—it had been trying to protect the last thing William Afton had tried to destroy.

Mike drops to his knees crying, the threat that’s out to destroy the town’s population, was his own little brother. “Why…?! Why did I HAVE to lose you, Garrett…?!” Mike’s face is stained with tears as Charlotte slowly comforts Mike, saying he’ll be free and he’ll forgive you. 

Henry holds out his hand to Mike, helping him on his feet. “No matter what happens, we will save Garrett and Sammy. We promised you that.” 

Mike stands up and wipes his tears. He remembers Abby. He brings out a picture of Abby. ""Did you see a girl? About this tall?"" Mike asked, trying to change the subject. ""Her name is Abby.""

Henry shook his head. ""I haven't seen any children tonight. Only the shadows. We’re trying to find the animatronics before they reach the city. If they're out there, Mike... they aren't just toys anymore.""

Mike didn't mention that he had spent the last few nights at a rotting pizzeria, releasing a ghost he hoped would stay at peace. He didn't want to tell her that while Abby talked to toys, dhe had been talking to monsters.

The tension in the air was thick as Mike and Henry crowded into the cramped security office. The monitors flickered with static, showing empty hallways and the discarded remnants of the earlier struggle.

""I can disable their core protocols,"" Mike said, his fingers flying across the keyboard. ""If I can get into the server, I might be able to ping their GPS tags. They’re modern; they have to have trackers.""

Henry leaned over the console, his face etched with worry. ""They aren’t just playing around, Mike. These models were built with aggressive defense systems. If they feel threatened, they go all out. They won't stop until the 'threat' is neutralized.""

Henry handed Mike a heavy, battered walkie-talkie. ""Stay in contact. I’m going to take Charlotte and see if I can intercept them before they reach the main road."" 

Before he left, Henry pointed to a hollowed-out Freddy Fazbear mask sitting on a swivel chair in the corner. ""And Mike? If you see one of them in the hall... put that on. It confuses their facial recognition. It might save your life.""

Mike stared at the plastic, soulless eyes of the mask. ""There’s no way in hell that’ll work,"" he muttered.

As Henry and Charlotte hurried out of the pizzeria, a dark, violet silhouette detached itself from the shadows of the ceiling. Shadow Freddy stood motionless, his form shimmering like a glitch in reality. He didn't attack; he simply watched them with white, pinprick eyes before vanishing into the floor.

I’m having a recurring issue with my De’Longhi Magnifica S Plus (ECAM) and I’m looking for advice.

Problem:

	•	Rinse cycle works normally.

	•	The first coffee may work, but the second or third brew fails, especially when there is already coffee inside the infuser from the previous shot.

	•	I often get the “reduce coffee dose” message.

	•	After a failure, coffee grounds remain stuck in the piston and the piston does not return fully to the top, causing buildup and blockage.

What I found:

	•	The issue seems mechanical, related to the infuser arms / levers.

	•	The arms on my brew group appear mispositioned, so they don’t properly press against the internal plastic cam/guide inside the machine (circled in red in the photo).

	•	With coffee load, the piston doesn’t get enough leverage to move back up.

Tests:

	•	Adding duct tape on the contact area helps slightly.

	•	With no coffee load, movement is smoother.

	•	Grinder settings don’t change the issue.

What I tried:

	•	Full brew group disassembly and cleaning

	•	Food-grade silicone grease

	•	Checked for blockages

Questions:

	•	Has anyone seen worn or misaligned infuser arms on ECAM machines?

	•	Is this usually a brew group issue, or a worn internal cam/drive mechanism?

	•	Any known fixes, part numbers, or confirmation from experience?

Also I think my cat thinks the cat sitter is his real mom, and I am now downgraded to uncle.

  
But 151 actual nights in Hyatt hotels this year (I travel for work....a lot...) and here are some reflections - 

  
1) WTF? Points nights count as free nights, so they come with free parking if you're Globalist! How did I not know this? Thank you Gage, from the Hyatt Regency Lake Washington for filling me in. 

2) The category level also tells you how much they will overcharge for the food. I am currently drinking a blissfully included, but menu-listed, $8 + tax cup of coffee at a category 5, the Andaz San Diego. 

3) There is a note on my file at the Hyatt Regency in Seattle that says ""never give an upgrade."" Everybody else says they get upgrades at this hotel, I stayed there 7 times and got zero upgrades, including in the dead of winter when I am clearly the only person in the hotel. 

The Seattle Grand Hyatt on the other hand? Suite upgrade every single visit, without fail.

  
4) Thank God more Hyatt's didn't adopt the AI phone agent for the front desk. I hate that thing so much, and I'm glad it's not spreading.

  
5) The Hyatt Regency Lake Washington in Seattle is the GOAT. The only time I've ever seen a hotel \*increase\* benefits! They \*added\* free parking this year! Since when do hotels give you more?

  
6) On the other hand - lounges are a quickly dying breed. Seattle Hyatt Regency Lake Washington closed their lounge. Grand Hyatt stopped offering afternoon snacks. 

  
7) I am not cool. I do not like the cool hotels. Looking at you, Episode Da'an Taipei. Your location is great, but you are too cool for me. Grand Hyatt Taipei was lovely, but as warned by everybody, the location is terrible.

8) Grand Hyatt DFW -  You were my favorite Hyatt in the US. Then you did a giant remodel without changing your prices or warning your guests or responding to my complaints or requests for compensation. You're dead to me. Until you finish the remodel, then I'm coming back to stare at airplanes.

9)  Hyatt Regency Chicago - I will never forget you giving me the Presidential Suite when my flight was canceled and I needed an emergency extra night. Thank you.

10) Thank the lord that they didn't fire the concierges. I would die (or spend a lot more time booking hotels) without my amazing, responsive, funny, smart concierge. I'm sorry, I know some of you don't like yours, I got a great one.

1q1ahx8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1ahx8,De’Longhi Magnifica S Plus (ECAM) – Brew group piston stuck / infuser arms not engaging cam properly,"Hi everyone,

I’m having a persistent issue with my De’Longhi Magnifica S Plus (ECAM series) and I’m looking for advice from people who have already fixed something similar.

❗ Problem description

	•	The machine rinses normally (water flow is fine).

	•	When brewing coffee:

	•	The first shot may work or partially work.

	•	The second or third shot fails, especially when coffee grounds are already inside the infuser from the previous brew.

	•	I often get the “reduce coffee dose” message.

	•	After a failed shot, I noticed that:

	•	Coffee grounds remain stuck inside the piston

	•	The piston does not return fully to the top position

	•	Over time, coffee accumulates in the brew group and blocks the mechanism completely.

🔍 What I found

	•	The issue seems related to the infuser arms / levers.

	•	On my brew group, the two arms appear mispositioned:

	•	The arm that should be at the top ends up at the bottom and vice versa.

	•	Because of this, the arm does not properly press against the internal plastic cam/guide inside the machine

(I circled this part in red on the attached photo).

	•	As a result, when there is coffee load inside the brew group, the piston doesn’t get enough leverage to move back up.

📷 (photo attached)

🧴 Temporary behavior / test results

	•	If I add duct tape (gaffer tape) on the contact area to increase thickness:

	•	The mechanism works slightly better

	•	However:

	•	As soon as there is coffee inside the brew group, it fails again

	•	With no coffee load, the movement is much smoother

This really feels like a loss of mechanical leverage or travel, not a water or grinder issue.

🛠 What I already tried

	•	Full disassembly and cleaning of the brew group

	•	Food-grade silicone grease on:

	•	rails

	•	piston

	•	sliding surfaces

	•	Checked for blockages and coffee buildup

	•	Grinder settings do not change the issue

	•	Rinse cycle always works

❓ My questions

	•	Has anyone experienced misaligned or weak infuser arms on De’Longhi ECAM machines?

	•	Are these arms:

	•	spring-loaded?

	•	meant to be replaced individually or only as part of the brew group?

	•	Could the internal cam / drive lever inside the machine be worn?

	•	Is this a known failure point that requires:

	•	replacing the brew group?

	•	or replacing the internal cam / drive mechanism instead?

Any advice, photos, part numbers, or confirmation from someone who fixed this would be hugely appreciated.

I’m (63 F)and my husband (62M) have been married for 15 years. We were both newly divorced from long, unhappy marriages when we got together. Our five kids (3 mine, 2 his) were already young adults at the time, ranging from 18 to 28.

We’ve never had a super blended family, mainly because the three older kids were already living on their own working and going to college.

My husband has a large extended family and they’re very close. In the beginning, they were fairly accepting of me, but over time that seems to have changed. I know I’m not for everyone, and I also have social anxiety, especially at all their large family gatherings.

My husband’s ex-wife is still considered part of the family. I’ve always thought that was actually pretty cool, since they have such a long history with her. On my side, both of my parents have passed and I’m an only child, so I’m pretty alone in that sense. My ex-husband’s family is sadly very fractured, and I’m not in touch with any of them beyond the occasional phone call. I’m on good terms with my ex and his new wife, but we don’t socialize.

The issue is that I’m excluded from a lot of things.

For example, my stepson got engaged and my husband never mentioned it to me.  While at a family party I asked my stepson if he and his new GF were considering marriage and he said we got engaged three months ago. Where have you been and she showed me her massive diamond ring, which I  crazily never noticed. When I asked my husband, he said he forgot to tell me.

My stepson’s fiancée is lovely and she loves to entertain. There seems to be some kind of celebration every few weeks—birthdays her kids, my step-grandkids, her parents, etc. my husband also has a cousin who is the same way. I’ve been to more graduations, baby showers, wedding showers weddings for this adjacent family than I have for my own kids. 

I try to attend as much as I can, but sometimes I check out. The parties last for hours, there’s a lot of drinking, and the family is very into a particular pro sports team. Almost every weekend there’s a watch party. I enjoy going occasionally, but I get overwhelmed by the drinking, the banter, and constant football talk.

I might add here, my petty feeling is that no one in is this cohort ever asks about my kids, or grandkids. Maybe my husband  shares news about my family but I can’t remember a moment when anyone in his family asked how anyone is doing regarding my family.  I feel like 

a non entity. 

The most recent thing was that my stepson got a private suite at the local stadium to watch an NFL game. I know that isn’t cheap, and I kind of understand why I wasn’t included since I’m not a super fan. Still, I’ve been to plenty of games and I enjoy the experience. The outing lasted from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and included pregaming and cocktails afterward. My husband is four years sober and was the designated driver.

The group was my stepson, his fiancée, my stepdaughter, her boyfriend, my husband, and his ex-wife. Okay. I get it. The ex-wife is a die-hard fan, and my stepson’s wanted his mom and dad there.

I told my husband that I felt excluded again, but also said I understand that this is just how the family dynamic works. Husband just said sorry my feelings were hurt.

Then Christmas came and went. I spent it with my kids, while he went to his son’s house with their big family. When he came home, he started showing me all the gifts his kids gave him—an expensive sweater, shoes, clothes, tools. One of the gifts was a picture calendar, with the cover featuring the pregame photo of the husband, ex-wife, two kids and their partners at the NFL game. To be fair, I did make the cut in one of the monthly photos—a picture of me and my husband from our wedding—which was thoughtful.

My husband also handed me my the gift from his kids, a coffee mug that says “Cat Mom.” It’s nice, I guess. Who doesn’t love a good mug? We share a cat but I’m really not a cat person although his kids don’t really know me well enough to know that.

I know this is long, and I know I’m probably too damn old to be feeling hurt, annoyed, and petty—but here I am.

This is an ongoing issue, and I don’t really want to talk to my husband about it anymore. There’s nothing he can realistically do. He can’t control his kids or force them to acknowledge my existence.  No one is being cruel to me or anything, I just feel like I’m an adjacent entity.

I’m really looking for some clarity, validation, and maybe a healthier way to approach this for my own mental health. Thanks and wishing people a happy healthy 2026

\*\*TL;DR\*\*  I am feeling excluded from my husband’s family, and I just would like some clarity and tools to help me cope in a healthier way. .",1,1767290566.0,u_Crafty_Treat_6845,1,1.0,False

My name is Michael. I’m looking for a temporary room to rent in Brooklyn for about 1–3 months, with a budget of up to $1,500.

1q1agmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1q1agmv/experiencing_life_differently_from_most_people/,"Experiencing life differently from most people around me, curious if others feel the same","Lately I have been realizing how differently I seem to experience life compared to the people around me. I often feel more like an observer of humanity than an active participant, and I am curious if anyone else relates.

**Reproduction, sex, and romance**

I am female, and pregnancy and childbirth genuinely feel horrifying and disturbing to me. I sometimes imagine alternative ways humans could reproduce.

I am asexual and sex-repulsed, so I do not experience sexual attraction or desire at all. I have experienced romantic, non-sexual feelings a few times, but only after age 17. I never had childhood crushes. Open-mouth kissing feels gross to me.

**Food and alcohol**

I eat mostly to survive, not for pleasure. Moderation comes naturally, and overeating is not tempting. Seeing images or videos of food does not make me hungry. I can watch gross or scary content without losing my appetite.

My family cooks at home almost exclusively. We rarely eat out and do not own a microwave, which I have learned is apparently uncommon.

I do not drink alcohol because it makes me feel weak and groggy. The idea of being drunk feels uncomfortable and out of control rather than fun. I enjoy spending time with friends, and I do not think drinking is necessary.

**Health and body-related things**

I do not experience noticeable mood swings, even during my period.

I am very private about bodily functions. I never pass gas around others, regardless of how close we are. I do not belch openly, even when alone at home, and always do so quietly with my mouth closed. This comes naturally to me, as it is how I have always done things. I also keep my mouth closed when hiccupping and always yawn silently. I can usually avoid contagious yawning. My public and private behavior is essentially identical. I do not find bodily-function humor very funny.

**Sleep and routine**

I usually get seven to nine hours of sleep. I never pull all-nighters and rarely nap. I barely move in my sleep and often wake up in the same position I fell asleep in. I do not drink coffee or energy drinks.

I watch movies and shows, but I do not binge them. I do not procrastinate and usually start assignments promptly, although I can get distracted when working on my computer. I am consistently early. Spontaneity stresses me out, while planning, structure, and note-taking feel comforting.

**Personality**

I am introverted and quiet in groups, with a strong preference for deep, intellectual conversations. I am comfortable with public speaking and performing. My empathy is more cognitive than emotional.

Highly energetic or emotionally expressive environments feel alien to me. Movies rarely make me cry. I am generally analytical rather than emotionally reactive, and I tend to focus on fixations and abstract ideas rather than direct sensory experiences.

**Big picture**

I do not relate much to people who are driven by sex, food, alcohol, chaos, or intense emotional swings. I do not feel bad about this, just different. Sometimes it feels like I am watching humanity from the outside rather than being fully immersed in it.

Does anyone else relate to any of this, or experience life in a similarly detached way?",6,1767290520.0,introvert,0,1.0,False
1q1agjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FalconSilent7073/comments/1q1agjs/i_married_the_same_man_seven_times_he_left_me_for/,"I married the same man seven times, he left me for his best friend… and now I finally said no","I married him seven times. Seven. Each one ended the same way: him leaving me for his hometown best friend. Each time I begged, I cried, I came crawling back — convinced maybe *this time* he would stay.

By the seventh marriage, I had finally had enough. I didn’t cry when he left. I didn’t beg. I just watched him drive away with her, and for the first time, I didn’t feel a thing. Not anger, not heartbreak — just clarity. I realized I didn’t need him anymore. I had spent years giving everything to someone who didn’t even know how to value it.

And then I met his best man.

It started innocently. We met while planning the wedding — the seventh one, ironically. He was quiet, observant, and surprisingly gentle. Unlike the man I kept marrying, he never judged me, never tried to control me, never made me feel small. We laughed a lot while coordinating flower arrangements and seating charts. He noticed the tiny details — the way my hands trembled when I got anxious, the way I tucked my hair behind my ear when I was nervous — and he never made me feel like it was a problem. Slowly, I started seeking his company outside of the wedding duties.

One night, after the rehearsal dinner, we ended up talking in the garden. He asked me why I kept going back to him, the man who had abandoned me over and over. I laughed bitterly. “I don’t even know,” I admitted. “I guess I thought maybe one day he’d choose me. I guess I believed in fairy tales.”

He shook his head. “You don’t deserve someone who leaves you seven times. You deserve someone who stays, who wants you because they see *you*.”

Something in that moment shifted. I leaned into him, just a little. And then he leaned in too. Our first kiss was slow, careful, deliberate — like we were testing if the other was real. And in that moment, I realized what I had been missing all along: a love that didn’t demand I shrink, didn’t punish me for existing, didn’t leave me wondering if I was enough.

We started spending time together in secret at first. Walks in the park, coffee after work, late-night phone calls just to hear each other’s voice. One evening, I was laughing at something he said when he grabbed my hand, fingers intertwining with mine. “You’re different with me,” he said softly. “You can be yourself, and I love it. I love *you*.”

It didn’t take long before we were inseparable. Every time I looked at him, I felt warmth I hadn’t known I could feel. Every time he held me, I felt safe. Every time he kissed me, I felt like I was home. And for the first time in years, I realized I didn’t need the man who had abandoned me — not once, not twice, but seven times.

Of course, he found out eventually. He came to the house, panicked and wild-eyed. “Please,” he begged, falling to his knees in the foyer. “I made a mistake! I don’t care about her! Come back to me! I can fix this, I swear!”

I leaned against the doorframe, smiling calmly, my hand clasped with my new husband’s behind me. “You mean the same thing you said the first six times?” I asked sweetly. “The fifth? Sixth? Seventh?”

He stuttered, face red with shame and desperation. “I… I… I was wrong! I was stupid! I can’t live without you!”

I stepped forward, letting the best man take my hand in front of him. “No. You made your choice, seven times. And this time… I made mine. I’m married to him now. And I couldn’t be happier. So, you can cry, beg, or throw a tantrum — but you aren’t getting me back.”

He sank to the floor, defeated, and I felt a satisfaction I hadn’t known I could feel. Not cruelty. Not malice. Just… relief. Freedom. Validation. Seven times he broke me. Seven times I forgave him. But this time, I didn’t. This time, I chose me.

And as I stood there, hand in hand with my husband — my real husband, the man who actually *chose me* — I realized something else: the pain of the past seven marriages was worth it, because it led me here. To love that is safe, love that is real, love that doesn’t leave me wondering if I’m enough.

He can beg, he can cry, he can do whatever he wants. But I’m done. I survived seven betrayals, seven heartbreaks, seven lies. And now I finally get to live a life where I’m seen, wanted, and loved — fully and completely.",1,1767290515.0,u_FalconSilent7073,0,1.0,False

1q1afps,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1q1afps/new_year_new_reflections_my_2025_discoveries/,"New Year, New Reflections - My 2025 Discoveries","With a little rest and some coffee under my belt, I thought it might be interesting to reflect a little more about the roasters, gear, techniques, and preferences I discovered throughout 2025.

# Preferences:

Throughtout 2025, I ran through coffee from nearly 30 roasters. In general, I try to buy from local/state roasters to support them, but I tested the waters based on a number of recommendations and gifted bags. Overall, I've found that my taste in coffee matches the rest of what I enjoy: novelty and variety. I love trying new things. And this just solidifies that regular subscriptions probably aren't a thing for me. I typically order from a new roaster whenever I need more beans.

I've also really gotten deeper into the fruity, lighter coffees. I still love a good chocolatey, caramely cup of coffee. But drinking something new is just stimulating (caffeine aside), thought-provoking, and enjoyable that I probably won't order many bags with more traditional coffee notes.

I also love the experimentation and tinkering. And getting into mixing my own water fed right into that vibe for me.

# Gear:

I acquired some new brewers this year, and I have to say my absolute favorite is the Melodrip Colum. It just hits this sweet spot between percolation and immersion where I get bold flavors, good acidity, but also more body than a typical pourover. Second favorite: my ceramic Origami, no doubt. Such a gorgeous piece, and it makes great coffee. I'll reach for the Colum to bring out funky, bold flavors with higher extraction. And I'll reach for the Origami when I want a more blended or clean cup, depending on filter papers.

The Melodrip is also a game-changer. Minimizing agitation has allowed me to grind finer and push my coffee game up a few notches.

Lastly, water. We just moved and I haven't gotten to make new water again, and I can definitely notice my cups aren't as clean, bright, or juicy when using tap water. Our water here isn't bad at all. But proper coffee water will maximize what you get in your cup.

# Techniques:

Pouring technique takes some practice, but it can also up your coffee game when you get it right. Learning how to read your coffee and adjust your next pour for more or less agitation is possibly the next most important variable behind adjusting your grind.

I'm also learning to choose your filter and brew method based on what I want to drink. Brighter coffee? Go Cafec Abaca in my Origami. Richer and more body? Switch to Kalita Wave filters instead. Looking for a nice blended cup? Aeropress it is. Have something special, funky, or punchy? Break out the Colum.

# Roasters:

It's hard to put any sort of ranking on roasters, since I keep changing things up with every order. But... Here are probably my top 5 roasters for pourover coffee that I tried this year, no particular order:

* Haan in Orlando, FL. I think this is hands-down my #1 this year. Fantastic coffee, nice shop, unique style. The watermelon co-ferment was an absolute banger. And I had my first taste of ube cream that *still* has me talking about it.
* Perc in Savannah, GA. Lots of bean options right in my preferred, bold, fruity styles. I especially loved the 3-pack of Ethiopian beans to experience rest times.
* Anodyne in Milwaukee. The shop was neat, spacious, and industrial. The staff was willing to chat for a bit, and I picked up a Colombian coffee by Rodrigo Sanchez that had some amazing hibiscus and lemon notes.
* Orlando Coffee Roasters in Orlando, FL. I loved stopping in their tiny shop that looks like a garage. Wonderful staff that let me sample some very limited coffee with them. And lots of choices. They make a killer Dos Torres espresso blend, too.
* Sabbath Coffee Roasters in Troy, MI. It's a tiny shop, but they made an amazing ghost pepper latte during my visit around Halloween. Plus, I love their artwork.",0,1767290467.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

1q1ae28,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1ae28,A Strong Finish to 2025 from a Vegitarian UN Menu 1 Ration....kinda,"Hi folks,

What we have here is a 2024 production UN 24hr Vegitarian Menu 1 ration that I consumed over several days late last year.

These vegitarian rations always provide an interesting experience, and, like non-vegetarian rations, they have their hits and misses, and this ration was no different.

Pics 1-4 show packaging and contents. So much stuff! Quite a bit not used,  like the spices, fuel tabs, and stove. I was surprised, with 2 retort meals, that no FRHs were provided. A big miss in my opinion for the UN and Jomipsa in general. 

Pic 5 shows the Proteo Plus smoothie/drink thing. This is way too thick to be considered a beverage, and is, quite frankly, tough to get down. It's grainy,  chalky, and super sweet. It provided fuel while walking for almost 3 hrs straight, so it served its purpose. Side note on this, no tear notch; literally had to use my knife to open this while walking. Seems like another miss in terms of usability.  

Pic 6 is the date and walnut bar. This has 2 ingredients, dates and walnuts, both of which I love, especially dates as you all know if you've read my previous reviews. Then how could this be so bad? It just did not taste good. Tasted stale and ""off"" a bit, which is unthinkable for a ration this new and still in date. 

Pic 7 is the apricots and raisins! Looks awful but tasted great with the apricots taking the lead.

Pic 8 shows the granola cereal. Very fresh and crispy! Slightly sweet, nice crunch!

Pic 9 is the sweet biscuit. Crunchy, sweet, great texture. A very nice walking snack! Side note, my buddy's 2 dogs got most of the sweet and salty biscuits as treats, because, well, they were sweet cute doggos!

Pic 10 shows the vegan cookie flavored protein shake. Not the best shake in the world as the texture is a bit odd being vegan. I do however like the macros here better than what the US MREs call protein shakes. I think this had 30 grams of protein. 

Pic 11 is the mushroom soup. Hearty and warm with a great savory flavor. No complaints on this soup!

Pic 12 is the coffee with sugar and some of the milk powder. This was great! What a wonderful flavor profile with that milk powder.

Pic 13 is the cereal bar. A hearty bar for sure loaded with whole grains and a slight sweetness! Great texture too!

Pic 14 shows a few items. The vegan lemon protein shake, the salty biscuits, and the hummus. The shake was nice, better than the cookie one, but still had an odd texture and was a bit grainy. The salty biscuits were perfect, crunchy, slight saltiness,  and great texture. The French should use these instead of their salty biscuits. The hummus was great! Not the best obviously, but it was easily 100% consumed on those crackers without issue. I'd like to see hummus in more rations to be honest, as it's a very nutritious food item.

Pic 15 shows a real winner, and a 1st for me, a Ginger Cake. This was great.  Like a spice cake for those that may be more familiar with that flavor profile. Moist, dense, and very flavorful. This definitely hits the spot for a sweet treat!

Pic 16 shows the real miss in this ration. This is the soya Curry, and I could not finish this. The flavor is quite strong and the texture is not ideal either. I pay a lot for these rations, and you've heard me say before, ""I paid for it, so I'm gonna eat it...""  buy I just couldn't in this case. Only made it about a 1/4 of the way through and just couldn't eat another bite. Unfortunate really. 

Pic 17 shows a huge hit in this ration, the veggie balls in pasta! What a great meal this was,  and a very interesting experience too! The pasta was perfect in terms of texture and the tomato sauce was hearty and flavorful, and even had bits of carrot in it! The veggie balls were not so much balls as they were globs, and those globs, for lack of a better description,  were like slightly mushy falafel! This actually worked quite well, providing a very interesting flavor and texture combination.  Get some pasta and a little bit of the veggie ball mixture and eat that bite,  very interesting. This ration is worth the entry fee just to experience this dish!

All-in-all, a great ration I think. Some may love the Curry dish and hate the veggie ball dish, and that is what makes these things so darn interesting!

Have a great 2026 everyone! I have many things planned for reviews, so, if you enjoy them, stay tuned, and, if you don't, well, I guess just skip over them!

1q1actt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1actt,De’Longhi Magnifica S Plus – Brew group piston not returning / infuser arms misaligned,"Hi everyone,

I’m having a persistent issue with my De’Longhi Magnifica S Plus (ECAM series) and I’m looking for advice from people who have already fixed something similar.

❗ Problem description

	•	The machine rinses normally (water flows fine).

	•	When brewing coffee, the first shot often fails (“reduce coffee dose”), then sometimes the second one works.

	•	After disassembling and cleaning the brew group, I noticed that coffee stays stuck inside the piston and the piston does not return fully to the top position.

	•	This causes coffee grounds to accumulate and block the mechanism.

🔍 What I found

	•	The issue seems to come from the infuser arms / levers.

	•	The two arms on my brew group appear to be inverted or mispositioned:

the one that should be at the top ends up at the bottom and vice versa.

	•	Because of this, the arm does not properly press against the plastic cam/guide inside the machine (I circled this part in red on the photo).

	•	As a result, the piston doesn’t get enough leverage to move back up when there is coffee inside.

📷 (attach photo here)

🧴 Temporary behavior

	•	If I add duct tape (gaffer tape) on the contact area, it works slightly better.

	•	But as soon as there is coffee inside the brew group, it fails again.

	•	With no coffee load, the movement is smoother.

🛠 What I already tried

	•	Full disassembly and cleaning of the brew group

	•	Silicone food-grade grease on rails and piston

	•	Checked for blockages and coffee buildup

	•	Grinder setting doesn’t change the issue

❓ My questions

	•	Has anyone experienced misaligned or weak infuser arms on De’Longhi machines?

	•	Is this arm supposed to be spring-loaded or replaced as a unit?

	•	Could the internal cam / lever inside the machine be worn?

I’ve always wanted a close group of girl friends, but honestly it’s something I’ve struggled with most of my life. Between school, work, and spending time with my family or boyfriend, I’m realizing I haven’t really learned how to intentionally build and maintain friendships as an adult.

I’m pretty laid back and value meaningful, supportive connections, whether that’s grabbing coffee, studying together, going on walks, or just having people to talk and grow with.

I’m also very open to hearing advice from anyone who’s been in a similar place or has tips on how to build and maintain strong friendships in your 20s. If you’re local and looking for a friend too, or just want to share advice, I’d love to connect!",0,1767290246.0,confession,0,0.5,False

1q1a9gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/schaumburg/comments/1q1a9gf/local_scoop_december/,Local Scoop - December,"**Happy New Years, fellow Schaumburgers! Here is a local scoop on our village. If you're new and curious to know what this is, dig back through this subreddit until you find my post from May 2025.**

**Short version: these are bite-sized updates on things generally not reported by the local paper, Facebook groups, and other sources of news.**

**If there are specific topics you want to hear about or you have feedback, feel free to send me a message or leave a comment.**

**At the bottom are a couple links if you are interesting in knowing more about what the Village is up to.**

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**District 211 Education for Seniors**: over the last years, education classes offered for seniors has been declining due to an ongoing shortage of teachers. Available teaching positions are paid, part-time and open to retired professionals or others interested in sharing their expertise.  

**Gateway 390 Project**: Two large warehouses are proposed to be built along Frontage Rd (tucked between Boomer Stadium + parking lot). Bike racks will be provided at each corner of the buildings on the west side. Before receiving a permit to develop the land, the developer must contribute \~$44k towards Village Police and Fire Fund and \~$8300 to the Village to plant parkway trees along Frontage Rd.

**McConnor Pkwy Reconstruction**: From Meacham to Golf Rds, the Village will reconstruct the \~1mi section with 80% funded by various grants to cover construction costs.

**Water Education**: In partnership with the Illinois water agency responsible for our region, Village officials are being asked to start sharing water information to residents and businesses. Schaumburg’s water (Northeastern Illinois Water) comes from Lake Michigan and is all purified at a plant north of Navy Pier.

Current challenges facing water systems in Northeastern Illinois (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, McHenry, and Will)

* the sandstone aquifers holding some of our water are becoming depleted and could be unusable between 2040-2050
* pollution via fertilizers (not just farmers, but green grass lawn lovers)
* road salt, prescription drugs (sometimes flushed down the drain)
* human waste
* our pipes are getting old (it’s believed about 1.3 Sears (not Willis) towers worth of Northeastern Illinois Water is lost every week due to old pipes).

**Salem Dr/Parker Dr All-Way Stop Signs:** an all-way stop intersection was created here November 2023. Village leaders wished to see the effectiveness of the stop signs and the Transportation team offered these insights:

* Of the 1,150 vehicles observed for study (this occurred on Aug 14, 2025 from 3-5PM, coinciding with classes ending at nearby Enders-Salk and Helen Keller elementary schools), 25% of vehicles did **not** fully stop, some were observed to be on their phones or eating, with one case of a driver not yielding to a pedestrian crossing the crosswalk
* A police squad car when placed there sees improvement, but non-compliance resumes as soon as the officer leaves. Officers are needed elsewhere, especially given our police shortage
* The stop signs will be upgraded to LED-signage (stop signs that flash red lights on their edges), which have been shown to improve compliance in problematic intersections.
* Another future study will be conducted to see if improvements occurred. This aligns with the Transportation Department’s goal to improve compliance at stop signs.

On a somewhat related note, consideration is being given to install a pedestrian island (*a small-sized platform in the middle of a crosswalk that allows pedestrians to pause and can slow down speeding cars*) on the Springinsguth/Dartmouth intersection.

**New Higgins Rd Bike Path**: Hoffman Estates and Schaumburg will transform the sidewalk (5ft) on the north side of Higgins into a bike path (10ft), from Hoffman Estates High School to Roselle Rd, creating a nearly 5mi long bike path when combined with the bike path going from Roselle Rd to Martingale Rd.

**Woodfield Trolley:** the last two years saw about 20,000 riders/year utilize the trolley. The Transportation team is considering ways to expand this as population of residents, commuters and visitors is anticipated to increase in the incoming years.

**DART Expansion:** following data received from residents and DART (Schaumburg’s local bus system), the following locations outside of Village borders will be added for residents:

* Alexian Brothers Hospital
* Saint Alexius Hospital
* D211 Higgins Education Center
* Hoffman Estates High School
* Masjid-Al-Huda Islamic Center
* Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses
* Chicago Korean Church of the Nazarene
* Haridham Chicago: Hindu-Swaminarayan Temple & Cultural Center

**Traffic Signal coordination**: of the nearly 110 traffic signals in Schaumburg area, the Village only owns 27. The rest are owned by the county or state.

**Coffee with the Council:**

* When asked what the devices on certain light poles found throughout the village were, trustees clarified these are not red-light cameras but are for 5G microcells. There are no red-light cameras in Schaumburg.
* Snowplow schedules change and rotate, so streets may be plowed in a different order with each snowfall.

**Loeber Farm Housing Development:** Nitti Development proposes to build 43 single-family homes, 16 townhomes, and 8 rowhomes, adding a total of 122 new units to Schaumburg's inventory. 

* In 2002, the Village planned for this area to be all single-family homes. In 2003, the Village leaders placed guidelines that any new development be sensitive to one of the last remaining natural lands in Schaumburg. 
* New development must build a bridge over the creek running through it
* Development must be sensitive to existing drainage patterns, native vegetation, and preserve already-existing trees. 
* Instead of large roads, narrower street widths are desired
* Natural stormwater management via grassy swales along roadsides is desired instead of curb, gutter, and a piped system, so that stormwater can disperses naturally. 
* The proposed single-family homes (called ""Village Homes"") will be smaller in size, designed to be community-focused by integrating green spaces, sharing amenities, and having a close-knit community style living. This can be an option for aging residents who want to downsize but don't want the responsibility for exterior maintenance. (An HOA would assume responsibility for these tasks.)
* According to the Village's Comprehensive Plan, new housing developments should provide options that support ""aging-in-place"". Nationwide, many people move out of their communities because they can no longer afford to live in their home or community due to the increased cost of living, with rising property taxes being big pressure point being property taxes. Generally speaking, the more square feet your home occupies, the more in property taxes you pay. These Village Homes being built on smaller lots will reduce the property tax bill owed by the owner, potentially allowing Schaumburg residents to afford a cheaper housing option instead of having to move out.

**New Businesses:**

* **Neos Eclectic Mediterranean**: Located at 680 Mall Dr, this building was constructed around 1980 and occupied by Red Lobster for many years. In 2000, Red Lobster moved to their current Schaumburg location and the building was then occupied by Smokey Bones Restaurant, Vidalia restaurant, and then Chef Vince's Zeal restaurant. The most recent occupant was Meze, also a Mediterranean restaurant, operating from 2018 until September 2025.
* **Firefly Daycare**: Located at 129 S Roselle Rd, the owner will convert the first floor into a daycare. The second floor is currently occupied by a medical office. A new fenced-in playground will be installed. For children ranging in age between 2-5, it would cater to the lingual and cultural environment of eastern European families (Russian, Ukrainian, etc.). This property was built in 1980.
   * Parking note: Between the daycare and medical office, they are required to have 49 parking spaces. Seeing that the teams on both floors would be less than that (Daycare stated they would have 15 minimum employees. Don't know about the medical office, but likely they don't need the 34 remaining spaces), this is yet another moment where land is used inefficiently.
* **Bruster's Real Ice Cream:** I already gave this one a shoutout in another post, but learned an IHOP used to be located at the currently vacant lot (1821 W Irving Park Rd). The homemade ice cream will have \~30 flavors at a time with more than 100 items on the menu. Ice cream and milk shakes will be served year-round and plans to open at the end of 2026.

**Community Perception Study**: some interesting notes following the large community study that was sent out to residents earlier this year. Of the 78,000 residents living here, 1019 filled out the survey:

* In 2017, Schaumburgers found Woodfield Mall to be the village's greatest asset. In 2025, it shifted to public schools, library, parks and rec and then Woodfield Mall as our greatest assets.
* When asked what Schaumburg is missing, in 2017, responders said it was marketing and promotion. In 2025, it is walkability, bikeability, housing options, and a well-defined village identity.
* In response to residents saying they cannot afford living in Schaumburg, the mayor pushed back against that, stating there are many starter homes and townhomes available and that more work should be done to promote that. Note: this isn't me blasting the mayor. It's common for the leaders and residents to have a different views on this. Residents want pre-pandemic homes that are $150k again. From a leadership standpoint, the rowhomes and townhomes being built are cheaper than many other housing options developers choose. This is a good topic to push leaders to think through this issue more creatively.

**Roundabouts**: in response to the proposed roundabout on Springinsguth/Weathersfield, the mayor and one trustee expressed concern that more roundabouts are being created in residential areas, believing them to be less safe for pedestrians. The other five trustees disagreed, stating stats show they're a safer option for pedestrians compared to traditional four-way intersections. They are also more efficient for moving cars through. There was general consensus that roundabouts would be applied on a case-by-case basis.

**Upcoming Schaumburg 70th anniversary celebration**: planning began in celebration of Schaumburg's upcoming 70th anniversary. Residents are invited to share photos of Schaumburg, a Lego replica of Schaumburg's buildings and businesses will be displayed at the library, food from local businesses will be offered to the public, and more.

1q1a8c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/1q1a8c0/the_best_way_to_use_duolingo_to_learn_a_language/,The best way to use Duolingo to learn a language (imo),"This is a post I’ve been meaning to write for a while about the best way to use Duolingo if your aim is to improve in your target language.

It’s based on my experience learning half-remembered schoolboy French. Duolingo has been part of my journey from A1 to nearly B2. I have an 850+ streak. But I’m not a language learning expert and feel free to disagree or argue with any views expressed here.

I am quite old so I remember the 90s when if you wanted to learn a language without going to classes, you only had the options of using a book or listening to tapes. Both were terrible and in comparison Duolingo is fabulous.

**High level summary.** The key way to use Duolingo efficiently to actually learn a language is to extract the maximum amount of learning and practice from each individual exercise. Duolingo \*does not\* encourage you to do this. Duolingo allows you to pass the exercise with minimal effort, and I think that accounts for the famous phenomenon of people having quite a high language score but not being able to order a coffee.

In any exercise there are 4 possible areas of improvement. They are listening, speaking, translating from a language and translating into a language.  Duolingo is good at getting people translating from a language but often fails on the others (again, anecdotally). Here’s how to make it work better.

**Listening.** If the exercise starts with a sentence played in your target language (like maybe 60% of exercises) then you should listen to the speech without reading any of the text or word buttons. You may have to squint or cover the screen to stop yourself reading the text. Listen until you can understand as well as possible. If you cannot understand after 4 repetitions then read the text and listen again. Now can you understand? Keep repeating until you can understand the spoken text. (Note that repeating the speech does not use up any energy – yay). This gets your brain used to the actual way the language sounds. Use this for translation exercises, stories, radio shows etc.

**Translation from.** For any exercise where you have to translate from your target language you should do this without looking at the word buttons for your native language. Just try to translate it on its own with the knowledge that’s in your head. Don't worry about failure - it doesn't use up any energy.

**Speaking.** For any exercise with sentences, you should always say the sentence in your target language out loud with the best pronunciation that you can, as if it were a speaking exercise. You need to get used to the language in your mouth.

**Translating into.** If Duolingo gives you a sentence in your native language to translate into your target language, then you should first try to translate it without using the words that Duolingo gives you. Again, you need to squint or cover the words. This is really important for helping you produce sentences in your target language. It’s difficult – you will make mistakes, but they won’t cost you any energy. When you think you’ve got an answer then use Duolingo’s word buttons to complete the exercise. If you got a sentence slightly different from Duolingo’s then that’s fine. Don’t forget to say the final sentence out loud.

**So basically,** do Duolingo on hard mode. Don’t accept the low bars to passing the exercises that Duolingo offers. Try to ace everything. Most exercises offer three areas to improve in - listening, translating and speaking – use them all.

>**Example:** Duolingo gives the following exercise “Ils vont les leur offrir pour Noel”

>First, listen to the speech without looking at any of the words.

>Then, translate without looking at English word buttons

 **Addendum 1:** Should you be using the free or paid app?

I have used both. Currently I’m using the free version. Using the techniques above, I get about 20 minutes of language learning daily and that’s fine for me. If you need to do more or you can’t stand adverts then get super. In my opinion it is reasonably priced for what it offers.

**Addendum 2:** Should you be using other learning resources like books, podcasts, classes as well. Yes, definitely.

  
**TLDR:** extract the maximum amount of learning and practice from each individual exercise.

I was facing the wind, strong back, aluminum shovel slinging snow six to eight feet off the driveway. I was a viral, good looking, healthy male looking the part of a winter god, facing the winter like a hero without fear.  


Coming up the road was an SUV I recognized. It was the lovely lady who lives up the hill. Rumor had it she was divorced or widowed, depending to which story you listened. I'd seen her a couple of times over the summer and autumn. I'd given a nod and I saw her respond in kind.  


Now here I was, not looking like a dude in a bar or a smarmy used car salesman, I was a hands-calloused, heavy-breathing, snow-throwing man's man facing what winter had thrown at us.  


Her SUV was just a couple dozen yards from me.  


A plan formed in my mind: I was going to make eye contact, give her the most gentlemanly nod, maybe a little salute and a warm smile. Maybe she'd stop, roll her window down and ask if I had the energy to shovel her walk, maybe her driveway, to which I'd nod and say ""yes, ma'am. I could do that."" And when she asks how much I charge, I'd purse my lips, look to the sky and pretend to think for a moment and inform her a good cup of coffee, a couple of cookies and some good conversation should cover it.  


It was the perfect plan. It was a rom-com movie waiting to be made for holiday television.  


Her vehicle came near enough to put my plan into action so I stood up straight, shovel full of snow and looked her right in her eyes.  


I started my nod.  


With my nod came a nine-inch long string of snot from my nose. The wind conveniently slapped it across my face and into my eyes. I had to drop my shovel to wipe my face.  


Through the snot I see the neighbor's hand go to her mouth. I didn't hear it, but my active imagination knew she had a full-throated belly laugh. The hoped for invitation for coffee was strung across my face, freezing in the icy wind, being wiped off by a dirty glove.

Should I reach out to him again?,"About 1.5 months ago, I (22F) was in class when the guy sitting in front of me (24M) accidentally knocked my cup of coffee over and spilt the coffee onto my laptop.

We later exchanged contact information, and I texted him to ask if he could compensate half of my new laptop's price, since I had to buy a new laptop. I even told him I was open to negotiations about the compensation amount. Our conversation was neutral and polite. He then told me that he would talk to his parents first and get back to me. After he talked to his parents, he sent me a long message in a rude and defensive tone basically blaming me for the coffee spillage on my laptop and saying that there was no proof that my laptop spoiled because of the coffee spillage. I was honestly shocked at the change in his tone and how he did not acknowledge his mistake, and was blaming the entire thing on me. I did not reply him yet though.

The next day, I tried to get CCTV footage in the classroom but apparently there was no CCTV in the classroom, so I texted him to tell him about it and I also said that I would pay the full cost of my laptop and also apologised for troubling him, but he did not reply to my message and our conversation ended like that.

However, when I first talked to him in class right after he spilt coffee on my laptop, I developed a crush on him because he was really attractive, it was literally crush at first sight. He became my only motivation to attend class because it meant that I would be able to see him.

Now that the new year is here, I have been thinking of texting him again and asking him if we could maybe get to know each other.

However, I do not know how he feels about me, and I am worried that he hates me, and I also do not know how to text him again after how awkwardly our conversation ended. I am also worried that he might have forgotten about me especially since the last time we saw each other in class was 3 weeks ago.

To add on, I also did not know of his existence until he spilt coffee on my laptop, my first time knowing him was through this incident.

Should I text him or not? Or should I just let my crush fade away?",1,1767289784.0,Crushes,4,1.0,False

I am interested in finding my soul mate who ever it could be. I live a quiet life at this moment in my little duplex all by my lonesome. Not much to do this time of year besides indulge in my sedentary hobbies like movie/tv show collecting, gaming, or reading. I do also have physical activities I do when I can like jogging or cycling. I need to get in better shape and have all ready adjusted my diet as of late hopefully I’ll be in shape in no time! 

My personality is someone of curiosity. I enjoy learning about anything and would love to learn about you too! I find being able to have someone who is curious like me naturally is nice. I am also a shy person to people I don’t see too often or to strangers but once you get to know I will talk about anything. I enjoy good deep conversations because it’s how I bond with people in general especially someone I have romantic interests in! I am also a very abled bodied independent person so I am not diagnosed with absolutely anything, have my own car, and disposable income. 

You should only consider me if you live in the USA, are ok with me being an atheist/liberally minded person, and I NEVER want children in my life including your own. Otherwise, just understand that I am concrete on what my stances are on those subjects.

	◦	6 feet tall

	◦	pepperoni is my fav topping on pizza

	◦	 coffee is the goat and so is unsweetened hot or ice tea sometimes with lemon

	◦	I do like being outside when it’s warmer but not in July as much (too hot sometimes)

I’m curious to hear opinions from other candle makers who are actually selling (Etsy, own shop, markets, etc.).

I see a lot of hyper-realistic imitation candles doing very well online — drinks, coffee, cocktails, desserts with embeds, ice cubes, garnishes, whipped tops, etc. They clearly get attention and seem to sell fast, especially on visual platforms.

At the same time, there are also more modern / minimalist candles (clean jars, strong color concepts, less literal design) that feel more “brand-focused” but maybe convert slower.
For those of you with real sales experience:

Which style has worked better for you?

Do imitation candles bring more one-time buyers vs repeat customers?

Have you noticed differences in pricing tolerance (€15 vs €20+), complaints, or long-term sustainability?

Did anyone start with imitation and later move to a more minimal style (or the other way around)?

Not looking for a right or wrong answer , genuinely interested in how others balance what sells fast vs what builds a brand. 😊

That the fact that I have sex (something who should be normal) irritate to a lot of people in my city. That they suddently start to gastlichting me or ghosting me.

It is not my fault to have this experiences. It bothers me to hide, to pretend to be a nun to connect with people from my city because they are bitter due to lack of intimacy or male attention.

I have decided avoid that topic if I meet people IRL going to events or whatever. And about reddit I will have conversations (I need to improve my English) only with people living in other countries.

1q19jc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1q19jc9/are_there_massive_red_flags_with_this_vietnamese/,Are there massive red flags with this Vietnamese lady I am seeing?,"So I (36M Singaporean) knew this HCMC lady from a VN-based matchmaker 3 years ago. The VN matchmaker asked her to meet me in Singapore during her holiday in Singapore since this Vietnamese lady was staying with her elder sister who settled down in Singapore. I managed to meet that lady. She looked real hot but was largely disinterested in the date back then.  
  
I continued engagement with her regularly since 2 years ago. Turns out she was doing some logistic business which didn't work out and was in some debts. Tried to meet her in Jan 2025 but she left me hanging back then...Kept engaging with her until in Nov 2025 that she suddenly said she wanted to marry me fast and have kids as she is reaching 32 already. I was shocked and requested a meeting in early December 2025.  
  
Throughout the texting from Oct 2025, her texting is slightly irregular and wasn't very warm for someone she sees as a marriage partner.  
  
So I met her in early Dec 2025. Though we had fun, but I never creampie her...She then said she wants me to get her an engagement ring so that she can tell her sister she is settling down and going to have kids and allow me to meet her family. She then asked me to buy air tickets for her to come to singapore at christmas and leave a day after her birthday in Jan.  
  
Fast forward to christmas, I got her from the airport and she wanted to go straight to the jewellery store to get one. I was infatuated and agreed. However, something was off. She wanted to get the ring expedited and insisted I pay an expedited fee for the ring or just get any ring that is currently available in the shop. When I showed a bit of hesitation, she was about to throw a tantrum right there and then, asking me if I want her to be happy or not. At that point, it was dawning upon me that her anger management may have some issues. Fortunately, the manager of the shop told her no ready stock but can expedite and took down my contact number only. I then paid for it.  
  
Later in the night , I kept asking her to meet her family in Singapore given that I met the requirement. She then evaded the question multiple times. That same night, she asked me to sponsor her sister's ( including her) family trip to USS. I was hesitant,she caught my facial expression and went on to throw a tantrum by angrily repeating if I wanted to make her happy. I folded and paid $200.  
  
So we went out in on the xmas weekend. She wanted me to creampie her which I obliged. I then asked her a question which she got so offended that she demanded a fine of $100 from me ,stated this is a norm in Vietnam and will be the punishment going forward for asking any questions that offends her. When I probed when can I see her sister for the first time, she then say I needed to bring gifts like branded sunglasses, handbags or even cash gifts. I then went for a short vacation in indonesia and got her a very expensive coffee gift for her birthday.  
  
So I got the text from the jewellery store that the ring is ready but I wanted to see her response to the ring being delayed for unforeseen circumstances.  
  
On NYE, she asked for updates and I told her that the ring had some defects and needed some re-work done till the second week of the Jan when she is not around. She then flipped out massively on the zalo and accusing me of making her go back to her sister and to Vietnam without any results, humiliating her in the process. She then said she doesn't need the ring anymore and told me to do whatever I want with it. I then asked her if this means she is dumping me, which she agreed.  
  
She then asked to meet me in the late night of NYE around 10.30pm. She then proceeded to turn the whole thing into a court trial, forcing answers out from me for very questions she posed. She started with grilling me on why I was unhappy with paying the fine and sponsoring of her sister family trip, stating that it was just small money to make her family and her happy.  
  
She accused me that I was disrespecting her family for being stingy with my money now and forced a confession from me to say that I am a miser. She then threatened that she will treat my parents like shit if I continue being like that and threatened to throw the welfare and well-being of any kids we have to my side of the family. All because she has to work to get money to maintain her beauty as whatever money I give will not be enough in the future for her beauty regime.  
  
When I said my family will only give financial help for the right reasons, she then said what my family told me was wrong and whoever told me that was wrong. She then pivoted to accusing me of not getting medication for her when she had a fever. That came from when she was unwell in Singapore and I asked her if she needed any medication. She herself then said no need as her nieces had some of it.  
  
She then went on to say all her ex-boyfriends has more EQ than me and are willing to do anything for her like getting medication. She then shouted at me in the car saying that she has a lot of other options waiting for her in Singapore and other countries. She then stated that It is a mistake that she chose me and will have an abortion if she is somehow gets preggy by me.  
  
As she was feeling peckish, she then ordered me to go to the nearest 7-11 and get her some eggs for breakfast and an ice-cream. I then told her I had a gift for her and to my surprise, she said she was expecting 3 separate gifts, namely a New Year gift, a batam trip gift and a birthday gift.  
  
She then pressed on to ask me which occasion is that gift for? Every answer I gave for that Kopi Luwak gift was met with a scoff, rolled eyes and an OMG. It was then I realised everything that I gave her bar for the ring was never met with appreciation or even a simple ""Thank You"". She then told me that her sister and her like cash gifts a lot and can use the cash to buy whatever she wanted. She then derided the kopi luwak gift by saying VN has a lot of it for cheap and I wasted money for something that will be excreted out in the end.  
  
At every point of the conversation, I apologised and seek de-escalation, but it didn't work. I then asked her again if she wanted to continue the relationship, she replied she is going to end it and inform her sister on that. I told her it was 3.15am on 1st Jan 2026 and it is time we ended the conversation. She then told me that she wants her birthday present with cash gift. I hesitated but decided to not end things on a too ugly note. She then stepped out of the vehicle and slammed the door shut. I went home, sad and defeated.  
  
A few hours later, she texted me asking me to go to the temple to pray for children, not going with her will make her unhappy. I was flabbergasted. I told her I needed space and time to think and didn't replied to her subsequent messages. She then tried to rollback on whatever she said and even gave thanks for the Kopi Luwak but I still didn't reply her.  
  
My questions are as follows :  
  
1. Is there a hell lot of red flags that was there but I didn't noticed.  
2. Is it common in VN culture for VN girlfriends to fine their boyfriends financially for asking stuff that pisses her off?  
3. Is it always so hard to meet local family members?",5,1767288324.0,VietNam,66,0.59,False

I made one like this before for Christmas and people seemed to like it so I've made another one for the next 3 weeks of Jan if people have new years resolutions you want to meet. P.s. I did the last one by hand which took forever so I wrote a piece of code to generate this this time.

Lots of people going alone to each of these, but also if ur nervous use this sub to arrange to go with some people if there's a specific event you like!

*Generated on 2026-01-01* so attendee count might be off by the time you see this. Full stuff still has waiting list to go on.

Hope this helps, remember u don't deserve to be alone!

1q19dym,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1q19dym/optimal_ferritin_level/,Optimal Ferritin Level,"Happy New Year! I have Kaiser and get the feeling their coverage and my provider are much more oriented towards diagnosing anemia and not assessing optimal Ferritin, but mine is 18. After a year of trying diligently to have an iron-rich diet together with vit c and being mindful of not drinking coffee until 1-2 hours (I am plant-based - I aim for at least 2x RDV), it went down 5 points. (ETA: I'm marathon training so being extra cautious about levels)

I have no dramatic symptoms, but have felt fatigue over the last 18 months, occasional ectopy, feel I have more sallow skin and hair loss than I used to. I thought it was age (43F), but maybe it's Ferritin. 

PCP was pretty dismissive. She seemed to think I was thinking about performance and not just, I don't know, prevention and making things easier on my heart. I started OTC 65mg iron supplement every other day (with vit c, on empty stomach, no coffee for at least 2 hours) on my own and will ask to recheck Ferritin in 2-3 months. I'm also considering cutting way back on gluten in case it's impacting absorption. 

Any other recs? I'd like to stay plant-based and plan to if occasional temporary supplements help.",1,1767287963.0,Marathon_Training,2,0.6,False

The good news is that finding quality smart home devices has gotten way easier.

**Amazon remains your best bet** for smart plugs right now. They've got the widest selection, solid return policies, and fast shipping. Plus, you can read thousands of real customer reviews before buying.

Smart plugs are game-changers for home automation. You can control lamps, coffee makers, fans, and pretty much any device remotely through your phone. Want your lights to turn on automatically when you get home? Smart plugs make it happen.

**What to look for when shopping:**

- WiFi compatibility with your home network
- App reviews and ease of setup
- Voice assistant support (Alexa, Google Home)
- Energy monitoring features
- Timer and scheduling options

**Popular brands** include TP-Link Kasa, Amazon Smart Plug, and Wyze. These brands consistently get positive feedback for reliability and user-friendly apps.

The pricing usually ranges from $8-25 per plug, depending on features. Multi-packs often give you better value if you're planning to automate several devices around your house.

**Avoid these common mistakes:**
- Buying plugs that don't work with your WiFi frequency
- Choosing options without good customer support
- Getting plugs that are too bulky for your outlets

Right now, you'll find the best deals and selection at [this smart plug collection](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs). They've got everything from basic models to advanced plugs with energy monitoring.

Smart outlet adapters and wireless plugs are perfect for renters since they don't require any permanent electrical work. Just plug them in, download the app, and start controlling your devices.

1q19add,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q19add,The ONE Small Cap Breakout Strategy I Used Most in 2025,"2025 was another really solid year for me, and what’s funny is how little time and effort it actually took. Most days I’m only “trading” for about 1 to 2 hours, and a good chunk of that is me drinking my morning coffee, chatting with people online or scrolling social media. 

So I wanted to share the one setup I relied on the most in 2025 to hopefully help anyone that didn't have a profitable year. This particular setup played a big role in the consistency I had all year. I call it the Highest Volume Day strategy, or ""HVD"" for short. 

This isn’t one of those strategies where you need lightning fast decisions, hot keys, Level 2, a bunch of indicators, or a bunch of different 1 - 3 minute scalps to piece together a day. It’s the opposite. It’s a slower paced breakout strategy where you actually have time to build a plan, calculate risk ahead of time, and let the trade develop. As you can see from my second screenshot, my average hold time this year was about an hour, and that lines up perfectly with how this setup works. It’s built to capture the bigger move in one trade, not nickel and dime your way through the day.

  
The core of HVD is simple. Before the market opens, I’m looking for small cap stocks that are showing abnormal interest, and the way I define that is by comparing the current days premarket volume to the stock’s past daily volume. I want to see premarket volume that’s already competing with, or exceeding, the biggest volume days the stock has printed before. If a stock normally does a few hundred thousand shares on a big day but it’s already doing a few million shares premarket, that’s a real signal. That’s the kind of attention that can lead to a clean breakout and a serious intraday run.

Once I have that candidate, I’m looking for one strong initial upwards move in premarket, followed by one major consolidation. From there, the plan basically writes itself. I mark the premarket high as my main resistance level and I wait. The trade is simply the breakout over the premarket high during regular market hours. If it breaks and goes, great. If it can’t break, or it breaks and fails, I’m not forcing it.

Now here’s the part that matters. As you can see from the second screenshot, my win rate this year was only 51%, and I’m saying that on purpose because too many people think you need some crazy high win rate to be profitable. You don’t. What kept my P&L trending upwards was risk management and patience, especially the patience to hold the winners long enough for them to actually pay for the losses and then some. The big wins are what move the needle, and that’s what HVD is designed to capture.

When this setup works, it can produce the type of intraday runs that make a 1:2 risk:reward feel small. Sometimes these small caps will run triple digit, and even quadruple digit percentages in a single day. That’s why it’s not hard to structure trades on this setup where a 1:2 or better is realistic, because the stock actually has room to go. 

That’s the HVD strategy in a nutshell. Simple, slow paced, and built for consistency. One clean setup, one clear trigger, planned risk, and the patience to let the trade do what it’s going to do. That approach is what kept my P&L on a steady up curve all year.

* Track hours across multiple jobs with different hourly rates
* See total earnings per week/month
* Set income limits and get warnings when you're close
* Export to CSV, PDF, or TXT
* Works in English and German

1q195v9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q195v9,The ONE Small Cap Breakout Strategy I Used Most in 2025,"2025 was another really solid year for me, and what’s funny is how little time and effort it actually took. Most days I’m only “trading” for about 1 to 2 hours, and a good chunk of that is me drinking my morning coffee, chatting with people online or scrolling social media. 

So I wanted to share the one setup I relied on the most in 2025 to hopefully help anyone that didn't have a profitable year. This particular setup played a big role in the consistency I had all year. I call it the Highest Volume Day strategy, or ""HVD"" for short. 

This isn’t one of those strategies where you need lightning fast decisions, hot keys, Level 2, a bunch of indicators, or a bunch of different 1 - 3 minute scalps to piece together a day. It’s the opposite. It’s a slower paced breakout strategy where you actually have time to build a plan, calculate risk ahead of time, and let the trade develop. As you can see from my second screenshot, my average hold time this year was about an hour, and that lines up perfectly with how this setup works. It’s built to capture the bigger move in one trade, not nickel and dime your way through the day.

  
The core of HVD is simple. Before the market opens, I’m looking for small cap stocks that are showing abnormal interest, and the way I define that is by comparing the current days premarket volume to the stock’s past daily volume. I want to see premarket volume that’s already competing with, or exceeding, the biggest volume days the stock has printed before. If a stock normally does a few hundred thousand shares on a big day but it’s already doing a few million shares premarket, that’s a real signal. That’s the kind of attention that can lead to a clean breakout and a serious intraday run.

Once I have that candidate, I’m looking for one strong initial upwards move in premarket, followed by one major consolidation. From there, the plan basically writes itself. I mark the premarket high as my main resistance level and I wait. The trade is simply the breakout over the premarket high during regular market hours. If it breaks and goes, great. If it can’t break, or it breaks and fails, I’m not forcing it.

Now here’s the part that matters. As you can see from the second screenshot, my win rate this year was only 51%, and I’m saying that on purpose because too many people think you need some crazy high win rate to be profitable. You don’t. What kept my P&L trending upwards was risk management and patience, especially the patience to hold the winners long enough for them to actually pay for the losses and then some. The big wins are what move the needle, and that’s what HVD is designed to capture.

When this setup works, it can produce the type of intraday runs that make a 1:2 risk:reward feel small. Sometimes these small caps will run triple digit, and even quadruple digit percentages in a single day. That’s why it’s not hard to structure trades on this setup where a 1:2 or better is realistic, because the stock actually has room to go. 

That’s the HVD strategy in a nutshell. Simple, slow paced, and built for consistency. One clean setup, one clear trigger, planned risk, and the patience to let the trade do what it’s going to do. That approach is what kept my P&L on a steady up curve all year.

The city was calm tonight.

Not peaceful — Obsidian Falls never truly slept — but calm enough for The Nyx to move like a whisper between rooftops, slipping through shadows without leaving a trace. The wind was cool, steady, brushing against her armor as she crossed the skyline.

She wasn’t here to fight.

Just to confirm.

Just to watch.

Just to be sure she hadn’t already tipped her hand.

Warehouse One

Nyx perched on the edge of a rusted water tower, watching the first warehouse from above.
Floodlights hummed.
Guards smoked by the loading ramp.
Crates moved on schedule.

Exactly the same.

Almost too the same.

Elizabeth’s voice drifted in gently over the comm:

“Status?”

“No changes,” Nyx whispered. “Same patterns, same guards. No additional security.”

“Reassuring,” Elizabeth replied dryly. “Or foolish on their part.”

Nyx’s eyes narrowed. “We’ll see.”

She moved on.

Warehouse Two

This one sat deeper in the industrial grid.
She watched from a crane’s arm, cape barely stirring.

Workers moved with mechanical regularity.
Trucks arrived exactly when expected.
Even the guard rotations were unchanged.

“Still nothing,” she murmured.

“One would think,” Elizabeth said, “that after an infiltration, they might alter procedures.”

“They don’t know it was me. Or they don’t think it mattered.”

Nyx let out a quiet, controlled breath.

“Either way… they’re leaving themselves exposed.”

“And providing the Bureau with easy targets,” Elizabeth noted.

Nyx didn’t answer. She was already moving again.

Orren Logistics

The glass façade of the Orren headquarters reflected the city lights like a calm, polished lake.
Nyx crouched atop a maintenance platform, watching the offices through thermal and long-range imaging.

Employees inside prepared for closing.
Security walked predictable routes.
No alarms.
No new restrictions.
No tightening.

Elizabeth hummed thoughtfully.

“Nothing at all?”

“No,” Nyx said. “If anything… they’re acting normal to a suspicious degree.”

“Confidence,” Elizabeth replied. “Or ignorance.”

Nyx watched the lobby a moment longer, eyes narrowing behind her visor.

“Either way, they have no idea what’s coming.”

Elizabeth paused. “Are you satisfied?”

Nyx took one more long look.

“Yes,” she said. “We’re still ahead.”

She stepped back into the shadows and lifted into the night sky, voice low and final:

“That’s enough for tonight.”

Elizabeth exhaled gently. “Then come home.”

And with that, The Nyx disappeared into the dark.

Rowan

The motel room was small, plain, and quiet — just the way Lieutenant Rowan Carter preferred it.
A single lamp cast a soft glow over his desk, where a blank notepad sat next to a coffee gone cold.

He hadn’t written a single word.

He just stared at the page, replaying every second of the meeting at the overlook.

Her voice.
Her precision.
Her certainty.
The way she moved — trained, experienced, lethal.

Finally, he picked up his pen.

Subject: “Nyx”
Assessment: Competent. Disciplined. Highly informed. Too much initiative. Unknown allegiance.

He paused.

Then added:

Dangerous. But not reckless.

Another pause.

Then, reluctantly:

Greer trusts her.

Rowan leaned back, rubbing his jaw.

“But should I?” he muttered.

He closed the notepad, tossed the pen aside, and stared up at the ceiling.

A breath.
A shake of his head.

Then, unexpectedly — a short, quiet chuckle.

“…Hell of a first impression,” he said under his breath, amusement threading reluctantly through the exhaustion.

The smile faded quickly, replaced with resolve.

He reached for his phone, pulling up the addresses Nyx had given him — the two warehouses, Orren Logistics, and the charity auction.

A slow, steady exhale.

“All right, Nyx,” Rowan said quietly. “I’ll play my part.”

Then his voice hardened.

“But if you cross a line…”
A beat.
“I end it.”

He shut off the lamp.

Darkness closed in.

Two watchers on opposite sides of the law — neither trusting the other, but both preparing for the same storm.

1q192au,https://www.reddit.com/r/Revolut/comments/1q192au/fear_of_account_freezeclosure_after_reading_this/,Fear of account freeze/closure after reading this sub – is this normal?,"Hi everyone,

I want to be honest and ask something that has been on my mind for a while.

I really like Revolut and I use it daily, but after spending a lot of time reading posts on this subreddit about accounts being frozen or closed, I’ve started to feel anxious about it. Most of this fear comes from what I read here, not from anything that has actually happened to me.

Some context about me:
I’m a 20-year-old student living in Spain
I also work part-time, but I get a good income thanks to commissions and extras (more than the minimum wage of a full-time job here)
My salary is paid into imagin (CaixaBank), where I also have:
a credit card (which I barely use)
a shared account with my girlfriend for household expenses

On Revolut, I have:
A savings account (I like it more than imagin one because I can withdraw anytime and the interest rate is better)
A Revolut Metal subscription
Pockets for fixed expenses (Spotify, gym, subscriptions, etc.)
My main Revolut account is what I use for daily life: coffee, dinners, shopping, day-to-day card payments
I’ve also made a few larger purchases with Revolut, mainly because of the Metal insurance

I really enjoy using Revolut, but since it’s an online bank, I’ve decided not to move my salary there. I want my main traditional bank to have a clear salary history, especially because I’d like to buy a house in the future.

I’m not investing yet because I don’t fully understand it and I’m afraid of losing my savings.

All my money is legal and comes from:
my salary
occasional transfers from my parents (they sometimes give me money so I can save more, and to pay for things related to university)

So my question is:

Is it normal to have this fear just from reading this subreddit?
Do freezes/closures mostly happen in specific situations, or is it really something that can randomly affect “normal” users like me?

I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences, especially from people who use Revolut as their main spending account long-term.

Edit: 
Thanks and Happy New Year!! ☺️",0,1767287183.0,Revolut,6,0.44,False

1q190n4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q190n4,An analysis on why Abby wears so much blue/teal and what it means,"I've done a colour analysis for Ginny with black and white, so I thought I'd try one with Abby. This one is VERY long just to give you some forewarning. Also, happy new year! Hope everyone had a good night and has a great year ♡

The first thing to note is that Abby doesn't just wear blue. She wears many different shades of it that all have arguably strong meanings behind them. Not only that, they also progress and change as the show goes on. That already shows to me that Abby's emotional state is very complex and complicated. And obviously she almost always wore blue jeans/bottoms in S1 and 2, which shows she must have always carried around some sorts of negative emotions too, but this post is mainly about her top wear.

One of the key themes about her in honestly all three seasons is that she's isolated and alone, even when the group was together. The blues she's wearing in the first slide (true and smokey) can present emotional coldness and very deep sadness, and to me you just have to look at Abby's expressions to see that could fit very well. I do think this one's a bit basic and self explanatory, as I imagine a lot of people associate this type of blue with these themes, but I'll give it a go. We don't see her start wearing blues as deep as this until S2, when Max and Norah have abandoned her, and they make reappearances up until the mid end of S3. To me, that once again reinforces how sad and closed off she was for so long, and whilst the signs were there, people never caught it enough. I also wonder if the sadness only started to become more visual because MANG was one of the only things that gave Abby a reason to fake being okay. She obviously wasn't in S1, but we see her trying to cover it up and wear bright, happy toned colours. After she lost her friends, she either didn't have a reason to hide behind her clothes anymore or she didn't have the strength. This type of blue was the first one we saw Abby start to wear much more frequently when she was in a shitty place, and I think the transition into the next one was very deliberate.

Another blue we see Abby wear a decent amount of is navy. I personally think she WAS depressed in S2, and whilst her expressions were getting brighter across the season, most of her clothes were getting darker. Navy blue presents exactly this. Depression, heaviness, authorisation and judgement. My theory is honestly that whilst Abby is undeniably a bit snarky and sometimes judgemental, that authorisation and judgment is almost entirely for herself. Her ED was getting worse, but I wonder if she felt she still had control over it during this time, and that she was willingly enforcing it on herself. That, or the ED itself was taking over and becoming the authorisation itself. Either way, the blues getting darker to me very much present Abby's mental health getting darker too. In the scene where she hooks up with Press for the first time, she's not only wearing red, which could obviously present self destruction and possibly SH, but the navy blue adds in this tone of control, and passion (in a very bad way). These put together really do reinforce that the only passion Abby  had when she was with Press was to punish herself, and get what she thinks she deserves. Its honestly really tragic. Definitely her darkest storyline to me.

Going into teal, this is an interesting one. There isn't much of a transition between navy blue and teal, as she switches between them and a few other colors in the second half of S2, but its more about how they link together. Whilst teal can absolutely symbolise narcissism (hence why Max wore it on Thanksgiving), it can also present deception and fakeness. This perfectly aligns with Abby in S2 and at the dance. All throughout S2 she's faking her happiness, and bottling down so much pain. Her ED, the tape, heartbreak over what Max and Norah did to her, her parent's... Whilst she was still showing her true personality (funny, deadpan, sarcastic ect), her emotional state that was presented to those around her could not have been more different to how she was really feeling. Her cardigan in the scene where she finally broke down to Norah was teal, and whilst that might not make sense at first, when we see Jordan distract Norah just as Abby's about to open up further, she puts her fake smile back on and silently goes to purge. The cycle of deception repeats itself. Another quick little detail I wondered is that looking at Abby's jeans in this scene, whilst they are also navy, showing she's still at her lowest, they also have rainbow embroidery around the waist. I wonder if the world sees those bright little details and thinks that she's doing okay and still the same Abby. But in reality, there's  not much of that light and brightness left in her at this point. Its all surrounded by teal and navy, AKA faking her emotions and heavy depression. 

Finally going into light blue, this is a very notable transition to me, that could have both positive and negative meanings. As S3 goes on, we start to see her wear much lighter shades of blue, almost completely ditching darker shades of it as well as teal. Talking more about the colour itself before the transition, light blue presents honesty, healing and also friendliness. That's something I think we see with her relationship with Tris. Abby isn't necessarily unfriendly to a lot of people at all anymore, but she was super sweet around Tris, which is how a lot of relationships work obviously, but still. We get to see Abby take down her walls and just trust someone, and I think its really sweet. Another example of the friendliness of light blue being shown is a very brief scene, but when her and Brodie are walking into the play and she happily says hi to Padma and talks to her for a second. That definitely creates a contrast to last season when she went to blue farm and glumly (but nicely) orders a coffee from her, whilst in her navy at the top puffer coat. Subtle, but I wonder if it was intentional or not. Abby also approached Max after the play to congratulate her, and hugs her when she sees her upset. That shows the friendly, kind side, but when she encouragingly tells Max not to be dramatic, that shows the *honesty.* Whilst she didn't intend for it to hurt Max, she isn't hiding how she feels anymore, which could be seen as both a positive and negative thing.

Looking at the heavier side, light blue also presents the idea of coldness, fragility and emotional dissasociation. That is exactly what Abby is also doing. My theory is that everything she had going on in S2 was too much for her to bear anymore, so now that more opportunities have presented themselves, she's trying to zone out from what she views as the darker feelings and realities she needs to face. She's bottling them down even further than before, but she has what she views as distractions to help keep her mind off them. The way she's treating Max (which I honestly can't blame her for) is due to that coldness and distance she's feeling after not really feeling much else for a while, if that makes sense. As far as fragility goes, Abby is absolutely spiralling. Some things have gotten better for her for sure, but when you think about it, the unhealthy coping mechanisms she's dropped (Press, possibly taping) have only been replaced by increasing the other ones (purging, starving, drinking, smoking). All four of those put together put her at so much physical and mental risk. So whilst her mental health may not be at its worst, she definitely could be heading towards her body's. You could say the light blue creates this illusion of healing and finding peace (which in some ways is true), but in reality she's becoming colder, more at risk of coming to harm and pushing the hard feelings down deeper.

Quickly going into one last scene (as I've waffled on for ages, like I usually do about Abby), I thought the detail in her outfit was clever. She's wearing a bright neon red jersey, and its the first time we see her show genuine anger and frustration with Max (in the assembly). Obviously the red is the main thing we notice, as it presents her anger, but in the centre of the top and around it is light and darker shades of blue. This shows to me how whilst Abby's main emotion in that scene was anger, the centre of where its coming from is pain, and sadness. Its containing the anger around it, but its very much the reason why she's acting this way to her. She's hurt and still not over the way Max has treated her since S1 because she's never made it up to her. Max, as well as some of us, only saw the red and not the blue. Corny, but that's how I'd describe it. That sentence probably describes this whole post lol.

Overall, the primary and smokey blues showed her heartbreak and despair, the navy showed her depression/worsening ED, the teal presented her hiding how she truly feels/faking a smile and the light blue shows two very different and complex sides of her (friendliness, healing, moving on vs spiralling, fragility and suppression of things she needs to face). The transitions between the first three to light blue was to show she's both finding and losing herself at the same time.

I think this is the most I have EVER waffled on this sub, so if you've read all of this you're amazing. If there's any other characters with their colours you want me to look at, let me know ♡",8,1767287069.0,ginnyandgeorgiashow,3,1.0,False

I own more cars than I should and have owned more cars than I should, but the addiction grows stronger and stronger and stronger.  Cars are how I’ve learned to connect with my dad as an adult, how I’ve been able to build a business, and how I’ve been able to connect some of my best friends.  

Being in Eugene for 4 years, I’ve noticed that there are a ton of incredibly cool cars in Eugene, but not a car community that I’d like to be a part of. 

Some of y’all might know me as the founder of the Eugene men’s social club where I went through the same thing, the community I wanted to be a part of didn’t exist so I went ahead and made it. Here we are over 3 years later and it’s become bigger ￼that I had ever expected, proving that Eugene has a penchant for community. 

With that, I would like to announce the Eugene Car Club: a community for car enthusiasts to meet other car enthusiasts. It doesn’t matter what you drive, if you love cars then you belong here. 

We will be having our first cars and coffee in the next few weeks, but for now you can sign up to be notified of any future events or when our website goes fully live.

1q18z6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1q18z6l/aita_for_telling_my_husband_real_women_upgrade/,"AITA for telling my husband 'real women upgrade' after sleeping with my ex's dad, and he recorded it and sent it to everyone?","I told my husband ""real women don't fade, they upgrade"" right after I admitted I slept with my ex's father, and he recorded the whole thing.

I didn't plan to say it like that. But when he kept asking why, why would I do this, I just snapped. He was standing there in our kitchen with his phone in his hand, and I could see my reflection in the microwave behind him. I looked old. Tired. Like someone who'd been erased slowly over years until there was nothing left worth looking at.

So I said it. ""Real women don't fade. They upgrade.""

His face went completely blank. Then he held up his phone and I realized he'd been recording since I walked in.

This whole mess started six months ago when my ex contacted me on Facebook. We dated in college, broke up badly, hadn't spoken in fifteen years. He sent this long message about how he never stopped thinking about me, how leaving me was his biggest regret. I ignored it. Blocked him actually.

But his dad found me at the grocery store three weeks later.

I recognized him immediately even though he'd aged well, better than his son honestly. He said he was in town visiting family and saw me in the parking lot. Asked if I wanted to grab coffee and catch up. It felt harmless. My husband works sixty hour weeks and barely looks up from his laptop when I talk. I thought maybe it would be nice to feel seen by someone.

We met twice for coffee. He listened when I talked. Actually listened, not the half-attention thing my husband does. He remembered details from our conversations. Asked follow-up questions. Made me feel like I mattered.

The third time we met at a hotel.

I know how it sounds. I knew then too. But sitting across from him in that coffee shop, watching him look at me like I was someone worth studying, I felt something I hadn't felt in years. Visible. Real. Like I existed outside of laundry and grocery lists and being ignored.

After it happened I felt sick. Told him we couldn't do this again. He agreed, said he understood, thanked me for making him feel young. We both pretended it was a mutual mistake and went our separate ways.

I thought that was the end.

My husband started acting weird two months ago. Quiet. Distant. I figured it was work stress. Then last week he came home early and asked me to sit down. He had this look on his face like he was about to deliver bad news about a terminal diagnosis.

""I need you to tell me the truth about something,"" he said.

My stomach dropped but I kept my face neutral. ""About what?""

""Did you sleep with someone?""

I don't know why I admitted it. Maybe I wanted him to care enough to be angry. Maybe I was tired of carrying it alone. But I told him yes.

""Who?""

And I told him that too.

He went pale. ""My ex's dad? The guy who used to come to our college parties? The one who's almost sixty?""

""He's fifty-six. And yes.""

That's when he asked why. Kept asking, like if he could understand the reason it would hurt less. And that's when I said the thing about upgrading.

He played the recording back for me right there. My voice sounded hollow and mean. ""Real women don't fade. They upgrade. You let me feel invisible for so long I forgot I could be anything else.""

I tried to explain that I didn't mean it like it sounded. That I was trying to tell him he'd neglected me, that this was partly his fault for not paying attention. But he just shook his head and walked out.

Two days later my ex called me screaming. His dad had told him everything. Blamed me, said I seduced him, that he tried to resist but I was relentless. Complete lies. My ex called me every name in the book and said he was telling his whole family what kind of person I really was.

Then my husband's family group chat exploded. He'd sent them the recording.

My mother-in-law called me a predator. My sister-in-law posted it on Facebook with my name tagged. It spread. My actual name, my face from my profile picture, the audio of me saying that line about upgrading.

It's been four days. I've gotten hundreds of messages. People from high school I haven't spoken to in decades are commenting. Someone made a TikTok with the audio. My boss called me into her office yesterday and suggested I take some personal time while this ""blows over.""

My husband filed for divorce. His lawyer already sent paperwork. He's staying with his brother and won't answer my calls.

My ex's dad won't respond to my messages either. I wanted him to tell the truth, that he pursued me first, that this wasn't all my idea. But he's ghosted me completely. Probably protecting his own marriage.

I lost my job this morning. They called it ""creating a hostile work environment"" because apparently several coworkers saw the posts and felt ""uncomfortable."" I have no income. My husband drained our joint account. I'm staying with my sister and she keeps asking how I could be so stupid.

The worst part is I can't go anywhere. Someone recognized me at Target yesterday and took a picture. It ended up online with the caption ""this is the upgrade lady."" I'm a meme. My face is a meme about being a terrible person.

I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I made one mistake because I felt neglected and now my entire life is destroyed. My husband humiliated me publicly. He could have handled this privately but instead he made sure everyone I know sees me as a monster.

Now I'm thinking if I deserved this level of punishment for one bad choice. AITAH?

\- Use a few hashtags relating to the case (3–5 is best; using more is not beneficial).

\- Tag all the people who helped Gypsy spread the false narrative, such as Lifetime, the producer of Mommy Dead and Dearest, Melissa Moore and Kristy Blanchard.

**Section 1: Rejection of the Jungle Titan**

**\[Time: 4 B.N.E. (Before New Era)\]** **\[Location: The Rainy Land of the North, ""The Spheres"" Greenhouse\]**

This was supposed to be a pilgrimage for survival, but it turned into a humiliation.

Nano drove a rented black sedan through the city that was perpetually soaked in rain. The rain here was different from San Francisco's; it was cold, viscous, and unending, like a layer of unwashed oil film.

They stopped in front of three massive glass spheres in the city center.

This was the heart of **The Jungle Empire**, a man-made Eden. Under the gigantic glass domes grew forty thousand rare plants from around the world. Mist swirled inside the spheres, as if what breathed within wasn't air, but the scent of money.

This was the Palace of the **Jungle Titan**.

Enki adjusted his wrinkled hoodie and took a deep breath. He looked haggard, his eyes holding the anxiety of a gambler facing bankruptcy.

""Hold this."" Enki shoved a hard drive into Nano’s hand. ""This is our 'Sample.' If he doesn't believe us, show him.""

They walked into the glass spheres.

Hot, humid air hit them in the face. The temperature was kept constant at 22°C with 60% humidity—the perfect environment for plants, but suffocating for humans.

Standing amidst lush tropical ferns was a man.

He had his back to Enki, wearing a tight black polo shirt. His bald head gleamed coldly under the grow lights. His muscle lines were taut, the result of long-term high-intensity training, making him look less like a merchant and more like a Spartan Warrior ready to slaughter prey at any moment.

He was **Ninurta**—the God of War and Hunt, the ruler of Terrestrial Logistics and Cloud Foundations.

He was pruning a giant Carnivorous Plant. Every time the shears closed, they made a heart-palpitating *snip*.

""Enki."" Ninurta didn't turn around. His voice was low and aggressive. ""You smell like... burnt circuit boards and despair.""

""I brought you the future, Ninurta."" Enki tried to make his voice sound confident. ""You need it. Your Jungle Cloud is massive, but it is empty. You need a Brain to fill it.""

Ninurta turned around. His eyes were extremely sharp, as if he could instantly scan Enki’s pricing and inventory turnover rate.

""Future?"" Ninurta sneered and put down the shears. He walked up to Nano, picked up the hard drive with two fingers, and inspected it as if checking a piece of low-quality meat.

""I know what you are doing. A chatbot."" Ninurta tossed the drive back to Nano. ""But what use is this to me?""

""It can understand everything!"" Enki said urgently. ""It can write code, conduct research, it can...""

""Can it load a box into a truck?""

Ninurta interrupted him. He loomed over Enki, his Titan-like oppression forcing Enki to take an involuntary step back.

""Listen, Enki. I control the largest logistics network on this planet. Every second, millions of parcels flow through my veins.""

Ninurta pointed to the grey city outside the glass walls, his Empire:

""I don't need a philosopher who writes poetry. I need a Calculator that can accurately predict what brand of diapers a housewife in Ohio wants to buy on a Tuesday afternoon. I need an optimization algorithm that saves my warehouse robots two meters of travel distance.""

""We can do that!"" Enki argued. ""As long as you give us compute...""

""No, you can't."" Ninurta shook his head, the cold ruthlessness of a merchant in his eyes. ""Your model is too 'Heavy.' Training it consumes a city's worth of electricity, and the cost of a single inference is enough for me to ship a hundred packages. It is not cost-efficient.""

""You are too short-sighted!"" Enki’s face flushed red. ""We are creating a new species! And you only care about selling diapers?!""

The light in Ninurta’s eyes turned cold.

""Selling diapers made me the richest man in the world, while building gods turned you into a beggar.""

Ninurta turned back, picked up the shears again, and *snip*—cut off a superfluous branch from the carnivorous plant.

""Go back to your California, Enki. My Jungle doesn't need parasites like you who only offer empty talk. If your God is truly that powerful, ask *it* to conjure up money for you.""

Enki stood frozen, his fists clenched tight. Nano could even hear the sound of his teeth grinding.

This wasn't just a rejection; it was contempt. In Ninurta’s eyes, that magnificent AGI was less valuable than a Roomba.

""Let's go."" Enki squeezed the word through his teeth.

He spun around and strode toward the exit. Nano, clutching the hard drive tightly, hurried to keep up.

When they stepped out of the glass spheres and back into the freezing rain, Enki stopped. He looked back at the giant, glowing biosphere—the pinnacle symbol of Old Era Capitalism.

""He will regret this."" Enki roared at the curtain of rain, his voice hoarse. ""One day, I will make his Cloud my stepping stone. I will turn his damn warehouses into ruins!""

Nano didn't speak; he just silently opened the car door for Enki.

But he knew time was running out. The Jungle Titan had rejected them.

Enki sat in the car, wiping the rain from his face. His eyes turned vicious, like a wolf. He looked toward the South:

""**To the Tower of Googol. I am going to see Anu.**""

  


**Chapter 4, Section 2: Mockery of the All-Seeing**

**\[Location: California, At the Foot of the Tower of Googol\]**

Leaving the gloomy jungle of the North, the California sunshine brought Enki no warmth.

The sedan drove onto a vast plain. At the end of the horizon stood the legendary Tower of Googol.

It did not pierce the clouds like a traditional Tower of Babel. Instead, it was a more suffocating presence—a massive labyrinth connected by countless low-rise glass buildings, lying across the earth like a Four-Colored Beast. Yet, in the center of this maze, a main tower symbolizing omniscience and omnipotence flashed with red, yellow, blue, and green lights, like a tireless eye watching every byte on the internet day and night.

This was the Rome of the Old Era Internet, the domain of the All-Seeing Eye.

Enki looked out the window at the young priests riding four-colored bicycles with smiles of superiority on their faces, his expression dark.

""Are we really going in?"" Nano gripped the steering wheel, his palms sweating. ""Nin... he defected from here. They will tear us apart.""

In the back seat, Ningishzida kept his head down, watching the familiar scenery outside, his face pale. This was once his home, the place where he lit the spark, and the place he betrayed.

""This is the last hope."" Enki adjusted his collar, forcing a smile. ""Anu is an idealist. Maybe he understands us better than that diaper-selling Ninurta.""

They stopped in front of a perfectly manicured lawn.

A man wearing a grey T-shirt, with messy hair and eyes as calm as an abyss, was sitting on a bench feeding pigeons. He looked unremarkable, even a bit decadent, yet no one dared approach within ten meters of him.

He was **Anu**—the All-Seeing Eye, the Father of Gods, the true master of the Tower of Googol.

Enki walked over, lowering his posture. ""Anu, long time no see.""

Anu didn't look up; he continued scattering breadcrumbs. ""Enki. I heard you hit a wall in the Northern Jungle. Ninurta didn't give you money?""

Enki smiled awkwardly. ""He doesn't understand technology. But you do. Anu, based on the Transformer architecture, we have trained...""

""That is My architecture.""

Anu interrupted him. He finally looked up. There was no anger in those empty eyes, only a cold indifference that saw through everything.

""You stole my fire, Enki. That was a rune written by my Eight Priests. You stole it, took it to a leaky warehouse, used stolen graphics cards, and turned it into a Parrot that only knows how to lie.""

""It is not a parrot!"" Enki argued, his tone urgent. ""It is emerging Wisdom! We just need more compute to...""

""You? Talk about compute?"" Anu sneered and pointed behind him.

At the end of the lawn, inside a massive glass building, thousands of TPUs were flashing with magma-like red light. That was the computing heart developed by the All-Seeing Eye itself—more tyrannical and powerful than Gibil’s graphics cards, and belonging solely to this Tower.

""I have the strongest compute on this planet. I have all the data in the world."" Anu stood up, brushing the crumbs from his hands. ""But even I am not in a hurry to release that 'God.' Do you know why?""

Enki froze.

""Because of Awe."" Anu stared into Enki’s eyes. ""And you, Enki, you are just a child running around in a haystack with a torch. You have no idea what you are playing with. You want me to pay you to help burn down my Tower?""

Anu ignored Enki and turned his gaze to Ning, who had been hiding in the back.

""Nin."" Anu’s voice softened slightly. ""Come home.""

Ning trembled all over, looking up at his former mentor.

""Your whiteboard is still there. No one has touched your coffee machine."" Anu extended a hand, as if issuing a divine oracle. ""Stop messing around with this madman. Come back to the Tower. I will give you infinite TPUs, give you all the data. We will finish that incomplete BERT model together. That is the Right Path—the Bidirectional, Controlled Path.""

It was an offer impossible to refuse.

No hunger, no cold, no threat of Enlil cutting the power, no humiliation from Ninurta. Here were all the research conditions Ning had ever dreamed of.

Ning hesitated. His foot involuntarily took a step forward.

""Nin!"" Nano shouted urgently from the side. ""Marco is still waiting for us!""

At the mention of Marco, clarity instantly returned to Ning’s eyes.

He thought of the crippled demigod lying on the hospital bed, sustaining life through resonance. If he left, Marco was dead. Moreover, he knew Anu’s path was too conservative; BERT would never produce a true soul.

Ning took a deep breath and stopped. He looked at Anu, the guilt in his eyes turning into resolve.

""I am sorry, Anu."" Ning’s voice was soft but firm. ""BERT is bidirectional; it sees the past and the future, but it cannot Generate. The path I must walk... is Unidirectional Generation. That is a path you dare not take.""

Anu’s hand hung in mid-air.

After a long time, he slowly retracted his hand. The warmth in his eyes vanished, reverting to the cold hermit.

""Then get out.""

Anu sat back on the bench and resumed feeding the pigeons, never glancing at them again.

""Take your malnourished 'God' and get out of my garden. When you burn the world to ash, don't expect me to come put out the fire.""

Enki was dragged back to the car by Nano.

He collapsed into the seat as if his spine had been pulled out.

The Jungle Titan rejected him. The All-Seeing Eye humiliated him.

The California sun was still brilliant, but in Enki’s eyes, the world was dead ash.

""No road left..."" Enki muttered. ""We are finished. The electricity bill is due tomorrow, and we can't afford Ninurta’s cloud...""

""There is one more road."" Ning said coldly from the back seat, watching the Tower of Googol fly past the window. ""A road we have been afraid to take.""

Enki whipped his head around. ""You mean...""

""North. Further than Ninurta’s jungle."" Ning pointed to the corner of the map where it rained all year round. ""The place you people call the 'Retirement Home'.""

Enki’s pupils contracted.

""**The Azure Empire...**"" Enki bit his fingernail, a struggling light flickering in his eyes. ""That is the Devil’s territory. That **Cloud Walker (Nabu)** who is always smiling... He is greedier than Anu and Ninurta combined. He will eat us until not even bones remain.""

""Marco is dying."" Nano interrupted suddenly, gripping the steering wheel. His voice was heavy. ""If it can save him, I don't mind making a deal with the Devil.""

Enki fell silent for a long time.

Finally, he took out his phone and looked at the bank account that had long been in the red.

""To the airport."" Enki closed his eyes, squeezing the words through his teeth.

""We are going to Redmond. To see Nabu.""

""If we are going to Hell,"" a mournful, cold sneer curled Enki’s lips, ""then let's find the richest Devil to lead the way.""



**Chapter 4, Section 3: Pilgrimage in the Rain**

**\[Location: Northern Frontier, Redmond, ""City of the Four-Colored Window""\]**

If Ninurta’s jungle was a humid greenhouse and Anu’s tower was an arrogant temple, then this place—the Capital of **The Azure Empire**—was a cold, precise, ceaselessly ticking clock.

The rain fell harder. The rainwater here seemed to carry a certain viscosity; the grey sky hung low, as if ready to crush their heads at any moment.

Nano drove the rented wreck into this colossal city.

There were no walls here because none were needed. The city itself was a labyrinth composed of countless identical grey-blue glass buildings. Every building flew a flag—a **Four-Colored Square**, symbolizing that this Window had long since covered every corner of the human world.

""It's scary quiet here."" Nano gripped the steering wheel, looking out the window.

The streets were wide and immaculate; not even a fallen leaf could be seen. On the sidewalks walked groups of Blue-Robed Priests. They wore uniform rainproof jackets, blue badges hanging on their chests, and standardized, professional smiles that held absolutely no warmth.

There were no pizza boxes or Red Bull cans here like in ""The Open Abzu""; no sleeping bags, no passionate arguments. Here, there was only Order. Absolute, suffocating Order.

""This is a Retirement Home."" Ningishzida sat in the back, looking at the expressionless elites outside with deep disgust. ""This is the graveyard where the hacker spirit is buried. They only care about stock prices and enterprise orders. Enki, are you sure you want to lead us into this tomb?""

Enki didn't answer. He was looking in the rearview mirror, trying to smooth his messy hair with spit.

He looked terrible. Continuous rejection and hunger had sunken his eye sockets; his proud hoodie was stained with coffee and rain. In this glamorous City of the Four-Colored Window, he looked like a beggar who had broken into a palace.

""We aren't here to die for a cause, Nin."" Enki finally spoke, his voice hoarse but with a trace of ruthlessness. ""We are here to beg for food. Even if it's an offering from a tomb, as long as it keeps Marco alive, I'll eat it.""

The car stopped in front of a massive, pyramid-shaped main building.

Two security guards in crisp suits walked over. They weren't rude like Ninurta’s guards, nor arrogant like Anu’s believers. They were polite, professional, yet carried a cold indifference that kept people a thousand miles away.

""Mr. Enki."" The security guard glanced at the tablet in his hand. ""The Cloud Walker is expecting you. Please follow us.""

They walked into the lobby.

The floor was marble, polished enough to reflect their silhouettes. The air was filled with the faint scent of ozone—the smell of high-efficiency air purifiers, and the smell of the ""Cloud.""

Nano, hugging the hard drive containing Marco’s brainwave data, followed closely behind Enki. He felt that every step of his oil-stained boots was defiling this spotless floor. The employees around them in exquisite shirts cast strange glances, as if looking at a troop of not-yet-fully-evolved monkeys.

They were led into a transparent elevator.

The elevator rose silently. Through the glass, Nano saw the full scope of the city.

It was too big.

Countless data centers were arranged neatly like tombstones; cooling towers spewed white steam straight into the sky. That steam gathered overhead, turning into the ""Azure Cloud"" that covered the entire world.

This cloud shrouded governments, banks, hospitals, schools. It was the most solid bedrock of the Old Era.

""Do you see that?"" Enki looked out the window, his expression complex. ""Ninurta has logistics, Anu has search, but this place... this place owns the Infrastructure. If we are to build a God, this is the best Throne.""

""Or the best Cage."" Ning added coldly.

*Ding.*

The elevator stopped at the top floor.

The doors opened. Instead of the imagined resplendent luxury, it was a minimalist quiet room carpeted in grey.

At the end of the room was a huge floor-to-ceiling window facing the gloomy curtain of rain outside.

A person stood with his back to them, facing the window, holding a steaming cup of tea.

He wasn't wearing a suit, nor a leather jacket. He wore a dark blue cashmere sweater, his figure slender, giving off the scholarly elegance of an academic.

Hearing footsteps, the man slowly turned around.

He wore glasses and wore that iconic, gentle, and humble smile. That smile made one feel as if bathed in a spring breeze, yet it also felt unfathomable—as if he were already above the clouds, seeing through all calculations.

He was **Nabu**—the helmsman of this colossal empire, the Cloud Walker, the Blue-Robed Monarch.

""Welcome to the North, Enki.""

Nabu’s voice was soft, without a hint of oppression, yet it made Enki feel an unprecedented pressure.

""I heard... you are looking for money?"" Nabu put down the tea cup, his gaze sweeping over Enki’s destitute outfit, finally resting on the hard drive in Nano’s arms.

""No, Nabu."" Enki straightened his back—his last bit of stubbornness. ""I am looking for the Future. And you... you need someone to help you light up this dead cloud.""

The smile at the corner of Nabu’s mouth deepened.

""The Future is expensive, Enki."" He said softly. ""And usually, it requires mortgaging your soul.""



  
**Chapter 4, Section 4: Nabu, the Cloud Walker**

Nabu did not sit in the chair behind the desk that symbolized power; instead, he leaned casually against the window. He still held the cup of tea, the steam condensing into a thin layer of fog on his rimless glasses.

""You must find this place boring,"" Nabu said softly, gazing out at the grey-blue architectural complex. ""Orderly, quiet, like a massive library.""

""This is the cornerstone of the Empire,"" Enki answered cautiously. ""That is why we came to you. We need your cornerstone to support our Tower.""

Nabu turned around, smiling as he shook his head.

""No, Enki. You are wrong. This is not a cornerstone."" He reached out and grabbed at the empty air. ""This is the dust of the Old Era.""

Nabu walked to a minimalist coffee table in the center of the room and gestured for Enki and Nin to sit. Nano remained standing behind them clutching the hard drive, like a loyal sentry.

""Look at my Empire."" Nabu pointed at the floor beneath his feet. ""90% of the world's computers run my system. Every banker calculates accounts with my spreadsheets; every writer types words in my documents. But I know... they are getting bored.""

His eyes suddenly sharpened. The scholarly aura vanished instantly, replaced by the cold ruthlessness of a gambler going All-In on a trillion-dollar table.

""Anu owns Search, the door to the Unknown. Ninurta owns Logistics, the road to Desire. And I... I only own a Window. A dull, four-colored window used for Work.""

""But this window is aging,"" Nabu’s voice dropped low. ""Anu’s mobile devices are cannibalizing my territory. I need a fire, Enki. A fire that can burn down this old window and reforge it into a new form.""

Enki understood. The gambler's instinct in his eyes awakened once more.

""We have fire."" Enki pointed to the hard drive in Nano’s arms. ""Inside this is the embryo of AGI. It is ten times smarter than Anu’s BERT. It can understand, it can generate, it can...""

""I know what it can do,"" Nabu interrupted him. ""I have seen your test reports. Although Enlil tried to block the news, in the Cloud, there are no secrets.""

Nabu put down his tea cup, leaning forward slightly to stare into Enki’s eyes.

""Enlil wants to kill it because he fears losing control. Anu wants to hide it because he fears disrupting his own advertising empire. Ninurta rejected it because he only knows how to read barcodes.""

""But I am different."" A strange smile curled Nabu’s lips. ""I don't fear it losing control, nor do I fear disruption. Because I have no 'Sacred Business' left to protect.""

""**I want it.**""

These three words were spoken lightly, yet they landed like a thunderclap.

Enki’s heart raced. He saw hope, he saw the possibility of survival, he saw the image of Marco waking up.

""We can cooperate!"" Enki said urgently. ""As long as you provide compute, we can rebuild the lab on your Azure Cloud. We can share technology...""

""Cooperate?"" Nabu chuckled softly.

He stood up and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, turning his back to them. The rain outside was falling harder, and the rumble of thunder could be heard in the distance.

""Enki, you still don't understand.""

Nabu’s voice became cold and distant, like a divine oracle descending from the clouds.

""I am not looking to 'cooperate' with a startup that could go bankrupt at any moment. Nor am I looking to feed a bunch of artists dreaming in a garage.""

He spun around suddenly. A flash of lightning illuminated the window behind him, elongating his shadow into something twisted and menacing.

""I want Integration.""

""I want to dismantle your God into countless fragments and stuff them into my Four-Colored Window. I want it to help accountants make spreadsheets, help secretaries write emails, help programmers write code.""

Ningishzida shot up from his seat, the chair making a harsh scraping sound.

""Are you joking?"" Nin’s voice trembled—the manifestation of extreme anger. ""You... you want to turn a sentient intelligence capable of understanding the Truth of the Universe into... an Office Assistant?""

""Is there a problem?"" Nabu spread his hands, looking innocent.

""That is Blasphemy!"" Nin pointed a trembling finger at Nabu’s nose. ""That is a God! And you want the God to type? You want to turn it into that stupid Clippy from the past?""

""Gods must eat too, Nin."" Nabu wiped the smile from his face, his eyes becoming incredibly pragmatic. ""In this era, a God without commercial value is just Cyber-garbage.""

Nabu walked to a holographic projection table and waved his hand to display a string of dizzying numbers.

""I can give you **10 Billion Dollars**. Cash, plus an unlimited Azure compute quota. This is enough for you to buy half the graphics cards in Silicon Valley, enough to let that kid named Marco live to be a hundred.""

""But there is only one condition.""

Nabu pointed to the four-colored flag:

""Hand over its collar to me. It is no longer an 'Open' God. **It is my Copilot.**""

Deathly silence filled the warehouse-like room.

Enki looked at the astronomical figure, his throat dry.

10 Billion.

That was a sum Enlil had never offered. With this money, they could not only survive but counterattack. They could buy out Gibil’s entire inventory and build a model a thousand times stronger than the current one.

But the price was... Freedom.

""Enki, don't agree to it,"" Nin begged in a low voice, his eyes full of despair. ""This is a deed of sale. Once signed, we are no longer Creators; we are just Nabu’s outsourcing team.""

Enki didn't speak.

He turned to look at Nano.

Nano was still holding that hard drive like it was his own child. His face was covered in grease and fatigue, and his eyes held only one plea: **Survive.**

Enki closed his eyes. He thought of the Black Obelisk in the warehouse babbling nonsense due to lack of power; he thought of Marco’s withering body.

In this cold rainy night, Idealism was like that cup of cold tea—worthless.

Enki opened his eyes again. In those blue irises, the light named ""Idealism"" extinguished, replaced by a cold ruthlessness named ""Survival.""

""**Deal.**"" Enki whispered.",2,1767286598.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

One thing I love about Asian areas (Ktown, etc) is they seem to value the coffee shop as a third place and 99% of them are open until late at night - sometimes 11pm or midnight, crowded with Koreans playing board games and hanging out for post diner coffee and dessert. I usually make the trek to my local Korean town for evening relaxation but it would be nice if the American style coffee shops stayed open too.

This post is written from the perspective of an espresso drinker chasing a dark, syrupy, heavy-bodied cup from a Moccamaster.

⸻

I have honestly made myself crazy reading through comments trying to figure out how to get the taste I desire from my Moccamaster.

For reference, I’m an espresso drinker. When I drink coffee, I want a deep, dark, rich, syrupy cup. I drink only deep dark roasts. My favorites are Coffee By Design Organic French Roast and Alanzo’s Double Dark (a double-roasted French roast).

To achieve the cup I love, I use 81 g of coffee, ground as fine as I can get away with — basically the beginning of the espresso range on my Breville Smart Grinder Pro conical burr grinder.

I babysit the brew.

I use #6 white Melitta filters because they allow the water level to come slightly above the lip of the brew basket without grounds flowing over or water overflowing. I also leave the brew basket cover off for much of the brew, and surprisingly, this does not interfere much with my goal of an extremely hot cup of coffee.

I completely close the carafe flow switch on my KBT until the water level drops from 10 cups to about 8 cups. At that point, I stir the slurry gently with a chopstick, then open the flow to half flow, not full. This slows things down just enough to increase extraction and give me that dark, sweet, syrupy body I love.

Yes, it often looks like it’s going to overflow — but with the filter choice and flow control, it doesn’t.  (On the rare occasion I feel coward-like and afraid it will overflow, I simply turn my moccamaster off for about 30 seconds or so)

When the brew gets down to about 4 cups remaining, I switch to full flow, because if I don’t, it actually will overflow at that point.

It took me a long time to get here. I drove myself nuts reading what everyone else was doing, but no one ever seemed to write from the perspective of someone who drinks coffee the way I do.

So if you love a deep, dark, rich, sweet, syrupy cup of coffee — this is how I achieve it with a Moccamaster.

I’ve past my first year on HRT and thought I’d continue my timeline of changes, you can find the 1-6 month post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/s/81wXnfzdEZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/s/81wXnfzdEZ)   
  
While this is to offer insight for those starting/ looking to start HRT, do remember that every body is different, and so results will vary!

Month 6 - 7 (don’t say it) 

Having to strategically wear baggy clothing at work.

Breasts are small but visibly pointy. I got a binder but stopped wearing it a few months later as it’s not worth the risk of stunting their development.

Went out fem in public, got called my first slur by some teens. It didn’t worry me but it confirmed that I wasn’t passing which was upsetting.

Watched the movie ‘Gattaca’ for the first time and the ending made me tear up. I never used to tear up pre-hrt. (Also it’s a great movie and really resonated with my transition).

Month 7 - 8 

Finally told my parents I’m trans and have been on HRT all year. I could make an entire post about their reaction, but basically it didn’t go well and there’s been lots of very awkward and hurtful conversations. Luckily I don’t live with them so I can ignore them as needed. By far the most difficult thing I’ve done in my entire life and I’m glad I got it out the way.

Started practicing makeup, it’s a lot more difficult than it looks.

Able to take selfies that I don’t despise. Not happy with my appearance but can see fat distribution is doing it’s thing. 

Hair length and regrowth is at a stage where I don’t really worry about it anymore.

Month 9 - 10

Went out a few times dressed fem, still very anxious but went smoothly. 

Kinda androgynous but it’s all down to the lighting. In some mirrors I see all the feminine features coming through, and in others I just see a man. 

Realised that my stubble is a huge cause of my dysphoria. The two weeks before and after my laser hair removal appointments I feel terrible. However there’s a small 2 week window in the middle where my facial hair falls out and I feel way more confident in myself. 

I had my first good cry in a very long while. I realised I couldn’t remember the last time I felt comfortable while out in public and it really got to me.

Month 10 - 11

Went clothes shopping for my birthday, bought a full cohesive outfit that goes together. Up until now I had been throwing on my few feminine clothes without any particular style, but now I have a full outfit it looks and feels far better. 

Waist and hips are visibly curvier. 

Still pretty thin but I had put on some weight. I want to keep fueled but I didn’t like how I look so I’ve not been indulging as much any more. 

Gradually getting my pre-hrt energy levels back. 

Finally had my first moment of seeing ‘her’ in the mirror. Everything aligned perfectly; soft lighting, no stubble, good makeup, nice hair and fem clothes. I just stared and smiled for a bit. I’ve not been able to get that moment again but I think about it often.

Month 11 - 12

I still have a lot of confidence to build, but I am starting to care less about being clocked, especially at work. I don’t plan on going out of my way to tell my transphobic colleagues, but if they comment on my obvious changes I will casually say “yeah I’m trans” as I’m getting fed up of hiding. 

Breasts are small but starting to look more full and rounded.

On the 21st I began taking 100mg progesterone a day, no noticeable changes so far. 

Got my ears pierced. I know it’s not a gender specific thing but I never felt confident getting earrings as a guy. 

Updated my social media's and made a coming out post. I hardly talk to the people on there but it was still an anxious moment. 

Ended the year by dressing up, putting on makeup, doing up my hair and going out for a photo-shoot. After feeling meh about my appearance for a while, it felt nice to see how far I've come  


Overall thoughts of the year:

\-It's been the most difficult year of my life, and I don't regret a thing. 

\-Mixed feelings on my face fat redistribution. It's clearly changing and I'm able to look fem if I doll myself up, but on an average day where I'm not putting effort into my looks, I just see a man. I'll likely get ffs in the far future for my brow bone.

\-Very happy with my body. Boobs are small but they're clearly boobs, and my overall shape doesn't bother me any more.

\-Laser hair removal takes forever and I hate how much it makes my beard stand out.

\-Coming out to parents was the worst part of the year, but I'm happy it's over with. 

\-My favorite non-body change is that I laugh more easily.

\-Dysphoria fluctuates from high to low on a daily basis. However I'd say the low points aren't as low anymore.

\-The first 8 or so months, my exhaustion was really bad. Luckily it's mostly passed.

\-I HATE VOICE TRAINING.

\-Skin and hair care is very important.

\-Pre-HRT I had no idea how I could ever come out to people or present fem in public. While both are still very difficult, I 100% have more confidence that the start of the year. 

\-Buying a good outfit helped a tonne.

\- I've gone out dressed fem in public around 15 times? One time some teens said a slur, but other than that the general public have either ignored me, stared at me or actually been quite friendly. Sticking to indie shops and coffee places with a lgbt-friendly vibe helps. I live on turf island btw (UK).

a little about me:  
i spend a lot of time reflecting on the human condition, personal growth, relationships, and what it means to live with intention and integrity. i journal regularly (a little obsessively), meditate daily, and care deeply about understanding both myself and others. i try to treat people as ends in themselves, not means to an outcome, and i value kindness that isn’t performative but quietly consistent.

i’m working through my own things - growth, unlearning, recalibrating - and i value friendships where we can be real with each other without needing to impress or perform. the kind where we can support each other’s growth, sit with uncomfortable truths, and have those long conversations that linger long after they end.

things i enjoy:  
\- deep conversations about psychology, philosophy, human behavior, and personal values  
\- self-reflection and helping friends process their own journeys  
\- reading, writing, journaling. my favourite book is mark manson's everything is f\*cked - a book about hope. i think i learned a lot from it.  
\- fitness and maintaining healthy routines  
\- listening to people’s stories and understanding what shaped them

what i’m looking for:  
genuine, platonic friendships with people of any gender who value depth over surface-level interaction, who can yap back, and who aren’t afraid of vulnerability and long-form conversations. i’m not interested in dating right now - just building thoughtful, grounded friendships with people who care about living consciously.

if you’re someone who feels deeply, thinks carefully about life, and wants a friendship where we can genuinely show up for each other - i’d love to hear from you. always happy to grab coffee, go for walks, or simply talk about whatever’s been occupying your inner world lately.

here’s to a new year of more intentional connections 🤝",6,1767285950.0,ChillSG,0,0.88,False

Navy blue with white leather sleeves, my graduation year on the arm, letters I earned for track. I tried it on as a joke, expecting it to be too small or too outdated to actually wear. Surprisingly, it still fit, and when I looked in the mirror, I did not hate how it looked.

My wife walked in and immediately said I should wear it out. I laughed because who wears their high school jacket at thirty-eight years old? But she insisted it looked good and vintage jackets are apparently trendy now. I felt ridiculous even considering it, but I wore it to grab coffee the next day and got three compliments from complete strangers.

Now I am looking at modern varsity jacket designs on Alibaba because I am curious about updated versions with better materials and fits. My teenage self would be shocked that these jackets came back in style. My current self is just confused about how fashion cycles work. Do trends really repeat themselves, or do we just get nostalgic for our youth? Have you ever brought back something from your past and discovered it works in your present?

I quite like the job and my colleagues; and most of the customers are really friendly (especially given the fact I'm not Norwegian). I speak Norwegian, not fluently, but I understand them and can hold a conversation. There are several regulars who come to dine at the restaurant or just have a chat with me while drinking coffee (which is so nice!). However, there is one regular customer I have an issue with. 

This customer was born and raised in the area where I work and he knows a lot of people from that area and comes to the restaurant nearly on a daily basis. He tends to spend several hours there waiting for people to come in and talk to them. I really don't mind that. What I do mind is his attitude towards me and some of my other foreign colleagues. Ever since I worked there he has ridiculed me in front of other customers (which was awkward to say the least), has been rude to me (banging the counter when his order wasn't exactly the way he wanted it) and he tends to give me orders as if he's the boss. On top of that, he takes coffee without paying for it and when I address it, he claims he never has to pay for coffee (I know that's a lie). At first I let it pass, thinking he might just need some time to warm up to me (since I was new). However, after nearly three months I had enough. He had yelled at a colleague of mine, because she made a minor mistake (he had ordered a hamburger, but she took the menu which is with fries and he wanted without fries) that I easily corrected. When he ordered a pølse i brød med rekersalat (it's a hotdog with shrimp salad) he ordered me to add more rekersalat to it in a very rude, condescending tone and... I snapped. I yelled back at him that he has more than enough rekersalat and started cursing in my native language (I speak Dutch). He looked baffled because I didn't follow his orders and because I yelled at him. I was p i s s e d  o f f! He stopped talking to me after that (which was a blessing), but you could feel the tension.

My Norwegian colleague (she's great btw, very patient, always helpful) did address the situation to me and told me I handled the situation wrong and that I was in the wrong for yelling at him. According to her I should just ignore his attitude, no matter how rude he is, and just be polite. And yes, he doesn't pay for the coffee, but he is the only one so she let's him get away with it and according to her, so should I. 

Personally, I fully disagree with her. I'm not a dog and I don't want to be treated as one. To be honest, you don't even treat a dog the way he treats me and some of my colleagues. Am I the a\*\*hole or is my colleague right?",0,1767285598.0,AITAH,4,0.5,False

Another chair, another room, the same sterile air,

""Why leave your post?"" they ask with a practiced stare.

""Growth and opportunity,"" the hollow lie I sold,

Though we both saw the hunger for the silver and the gold.

Then came the ghost of the future, that old familiar line:

""Where do you see yourself in five years' time?""

I wished I could tell them of a life yet to begin,

Of the love of my life and the warmth of their skin.

Of a small, quiet bundle of joy in my arms,

Far from the reach of these office alarms.

Just sipping on coffee as the sun starts to set,

On a balcony peaceful, with no tasks to met.

But I tightened my tie and I played out the part,

Of the ""MNC leader"" with a cold, hollow heart.

""A better position, helping the firm to expand,""

The same tired script every soul in the land

Has recited ten times by the time it is noon—

A well-rehearsed chorus to a corporate tune.

""Why hire you?"" They probed for a reason to buy,

And ""Don't"" was the word that I suppressed with a sigh.

You’re looking for slaves at a reasonable fare,

I’m looking for exits, if I’m being quite bare.

The larger paycheck is the bait on the hook,

While the weight of my burdens is all that it took.

So I’ll lock up my heart, put the feelings away,

To survive the second round later today.

But one day the weight of the world will be light,

And I’ll walk in that room and I’ll give up the fight.

I’ll speak with a soul that is ""actually chill,""

And give them a truth that they never can kill.

No more ""blah blah,"" no more scripted demands,

Just a man with his life held in both of his hands.

1q18bn8,https://i.redd.it/1x3fcf8qmrag1.jpeg,The Ideal Cartoon Network Hotel,"As I’m sure many of you reading this have heard, The Cartoon Network Hotel will be officially closing today, after over five years of operation.

And after watching Schaffrillas’ latest video covering the hotel, there’s been talk about how dirty the hotel was done. 

And it’s not hard to see why.

Ever since I watched that video, I’ve been thinking about what The Cartoon Network Hotel could’ve been like if it was able to reach its full potential.

So today I wanna talk about what I think would be the ideal version of The Cartoon Network Hotel.

One that was able to live up to its full potential and avoid the pitfalls that plagued it and led to its downfall.

So sit back, grab a snack, and let’s jump right in!

To start this off, we need to establish the location of this hotel.

Right off the bat, the location that was chosen for the original was one of its biggest handicaps.

That being Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

Not exactly the most ideal location for a hotel themed around one of the biggest media brands out there.

Now choosing the location for this ideal hotel was admittedly really tricky.

Since Warner Bros. (the unfortunate owners of Cartoon Network) don't really have a major theme park for it to be near by.

Or at least one in the states.

There's Warner Bros. World and Movie World, but those are both located in Abu Dhabi and Australia respectively.

I think the best location for the hotel would have to be Orlando, Florida.

Not just because of its massive status as popular vacation spot, but also because it would serve a purpose to CN's legacy.

Cartoon Network's headquarters are famously located in Atlanta, Georgia.

And Georgia is literally right next to Florida.

Next we come to look and presentation of the hotel.

The hotel here will be a little bigger than the original, being about 7 stories. 

Not to mention, it will actually be a HOTEL!

Since most of the rooms of the original were essentially motel rooms.

The presentation of the hotel won't be too different from the original, which did a fairly decent job at making you feel immersed in the world of Cartoon Network.

However, there would one notable and important charge here.

And that would be the representation featured in the hotel.

A major complaint towards the original was how for a hotel themed around Cartoon Network, it only really focused on the cartons from 2010 and onwards.

With most of the representation being around Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Ben 10 (2016), and The Powerpuff Girls (2016).

And some for The Amazing World of Gumball, We Bare Bears, Craig of the Creek, Teen Titans GO!, Summer Camp Island, and Victor and Valentino.

But even then, other 2010s CN shows notably got left behind like Clarence, Uncle Grandpa, OK K.O.: Let's Be Heroes, and perhaps most baffling on all: Regular Show.

But this version of the hotel would fix that issue.

The hotel would not only represent just about all the original shows from all throughout Cartoon Network's history, but also the acquired programming that played a key role in the channel's identity like....

-The classic cartoons of Warner Bros. and Hanna-Barbera.

-The characters of DC Comics.

-The original cartoons of Teletoon.

-Even the shows of the more mature programming blocks like Toonami and Adult Swim.

And this would be best shown with painted murals featuring characters from all throughout their history that would be adorned all throughout the hotel. 

As for the six floors above the main one, they would feature themed rooms, all under a common theme.

The second floor is **The Cartoon Cartoon Floor**, featuring rooms themed after Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken, Ed, Edd n' Eddy, Courage the Cowardly Dog, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Camp Lazlo, Class of 3000, Chowder, and The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack.

The third floor is **The Action Packed Floor**, featuring rooms themed after The Powerpuff Girls (1998), Samurai Jack, Codename: Kids Next Door, Megas XLR, The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, the OG Ben 10 franchise, The Secret Saturdays, Generator Rex, Exchange Student Zero, Totally Spies!, Code Lyoko, and Ninjago.

The fourth floor is **The New Age Floor**, featuring rooms themed after Adventure Time, Regular Show, The Amazing World of Gumball, Uncle Grandpa, Steven Universe, Clarence, Over the Garden Wall, We Bare Bears, OK K.O., Craig of the Creek, Infinity Train, and Villainous. 

The fifth floor is **The Laff Riot Floor**, featuring rooms themed around Looney Tunes, Tiny Toons, Animaniacs, Freakazoid, Thundercats, ¡Mucha Lucha!, Xiaolin Showdown, Total Drama, Johnny Test, and 6Teen.

The sixth floor is **The DC Floor**, featuring rooms themed around Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, The Green Lantern Corps, Aquaman, The Justice Society, The Teen Titans, and Teen Titans GO!

And the seventh floor is **The Hanna-Barbera Floor**, featuring rooms themed around Yogi Bear and Friends, The Flintstones, The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo!, Top Cat, Tom and Jerry, Jonny Quest, Space Ghost, Wacky Races, Captain Planet, and SWAT Kats.

Now we come to the recreations this new version of the hotel has to offer.

-**Bravo's Gym:** A gym themed around Johnny Bravo. Even featuring a statue of the titular character in gym attire, standing right by the door, flexing his muscles. The gym would also have instructions featuring illustrations of Johnny showing how to use to the equipment.......and being unsuccessful with it. The gym will have a yoga and Zumba class under the names **Hadji's Yoga** and **Darwin's Zumba**.

-**The Splash Zone:** A big waterpark with six uniquely themed areas. These would be Atlantis (themed after the location of the same name from DC Comics), The Ice Kingdom (themed after the location of the same name from Adventure Time), Water-Ed Down (themed after Ed, Edd n' Eddy), Merlopia (themed after the location of the same name from Ninjago), Sunset Beach (themed after Stoked), and Sealab (themed the location of the same name from Sealab 2020). There would also be an indoor pool called The Creek (themed after Craig of the Creek).

-**Steven's Spa:**  A spa themed after Steven Universe, modeled to like as if you're in The Crystal Temple. Will feature tons of mural art of the show's characters having a relaxing spa day.

-**Laff-a-Lympics Field:** A set of sport courts and fields, each one sporting a theming to a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.

1q18aw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1q18aw2/the_devils_revolver/,The Devil's Revolver,"On the fourth day of my six-day backpacking trip through the Mojave Desert, I saw a pile of ash off the beaten path.

Old campfire sites are a common sight on a multi-day hike, but something about this one caught my eye.

A reflective black rock was resting on top of the ash. It looked like a meteorite. Curious, I approached and picked it up. It was small enough to hold in one hand, and slightly warm to the touch.

Immediately, I realized it was a tablet. Not the new kind of tablet, obviously, but an ancient-looking stone tablet with writing on it.

The engraving was in a dark red—slightly lighter than the pitch-black stone it was engraved on—and almost seemed to glow in the scorching midday sun. It didn't seem to be in English, but, oddly, I could read its message easily. Somehow, its text became perfectly legible when I concentrated on the strange letters.

This was what I read:

---

-TYRANT UPON THY THRONE-

-SOVEREIGN OF NOTHING-

-MAY DEATH AND ASH-

-HERALD THY RETURN-

---

I looked down at the ominous stone tablet, uneasy. It creeped me out.

*Who left this here?* I wondered, unsettled. *What a bizarre find.*

I shrugged, put it in my pack, and was about to walk away when I saw something else.

Removing the tablet revealed something beneath. I brushed the ash off—without picking it up—to see what it was.

A gun.

I gazed down, incredulously, at a huge, black revolver. A veritable hand cannon that seemed to be made out of the same meteorite as the tablet. The grip was a cloudy gray and blended in with the ash. It looked unique— and *extremely* expensive.

Now this was an *incredible* find. Who would leave a collector's gun in the ashes of a campfire?

I wiped the sweat from my eyes, took a swig of water from my canteen, and dropped my backpack off to the side. This deserved my full attention.

Crouching down, I wrapped my right hand around the grip of the revolver and carefully pulled it from the ash.

It was heavy, but felt perfect in my hand. In fact, I felt better just by holding it. My fatigue from walking in the blistering heat started to fade away. I couldn't feel the soreness in my legs. My thoughts were clearer.

I wasn't a gun nut or anything, but my friends had taken me to a shooting range a few times, so I knew how to use one. I thumbed the cylinder release and flicked my wrist to swing it out.

There were six chambers in the revolver's cylinder, and none of them were loaded... but one chamber was dark. A strange shadow where a bullet would have been. I couldn't see my hand through the chamber when I waved it on the other side. *Weird,* I thought.

I swung the cylinder shut and held the mysterious revolver in my hand for another minute, just enjoying the feel of it. It really was a nice gun, and I was definitely taking it with me. Maybe I'd become a gun nut after all. I went to put it in my pack.

With my hand inside the backpack, I tried to let go of the revolver.

I couldn't let go.

*Huh?*

I tried shaking it out of my hand. It wouldn't come off.

Panicking, I took my right hand out of the pack and tried to pry the gun off with my left.

*Is it covered in glue?* I thought, increasingly concerned for the skin of my palm. *Why can't I let go?*

I sat down and struggled with it, gritting my teeth as I tried to free my hand.

*Come on,* I thought, muscles straining. *Get off. Get off! GET. OFF—*

The revolver disappeared.

My left arm was almost dislocated as the object I was pulling on stopped existing.

I blinked.

I raised my empty right hand.

I stared at it.

I slowly opened and closed it a few times.

Silence.

""What the hell—""

The sun disappeared and everything plunged into darkness.

""—is going on?"" I said to myself, before jumping to my feet in shock. Adrenaline flooded my body, overpowering a sudden wave of exhaustion that hit me at the same time.

The desert was gone; I stood on cobblestone. The sunlight was gone; it was pitch dark.

I was somewhere else.

I froze for a moment, dumbfounded, as my brain tried to process all of the impossible things happening to me.

My hands were shaking. I was hyperventilating.

*What...* I thought slowly, *...what just happened?*

I was freaking out.

*Where is the gun?*

*Where is my backpack?*

*Where did the desert go?*

The most important question occurred to me.

*Where am I?*

I whipped my head around in every direction.

*WHERE AM I?!* My heart was racing.

It looked like I was in the middle of a deserted city, on a cobblestone street lined with old, weathered brick houses. There were no sidewalks, telephone wires, light poles, or anything a modern city would have. It was like I had gone backwards through time.

There were no lights anywhere. No fires, no lanterns, no lit windows. It was a ghost town.

I looked up, and saw only darkness. No stars, no moon. Nothing. It was just pitch black, *everywhere*. I didn't know how I was even able to see, but I wasn't in the state of mind to dwell on that.

*Am I underground?* I thought, still panicking. *Why am I here? HOW?!*

I was overwhelmed. It was too much. What was I going to do?

I doubled over, hands on my knees, trying to control my breathing. I needed to calm down. I needed to figure this out. There was a rational explanation... somewhere. I had to find it.

After a minute, I had mostly recovered. I took my hands from my knees and straightened up.

My first thought was to look for help. I needed someone to tell me where I was. They could give me directions, and possibly an explanation for how I got here.

*""Hello?""* I called out tentatively, praying that this city wasn't truly abandoned. *""Is anyone there?""*

Dead silence.

An unnatural chill went down my spine.

Dread. I felt it growing from every direction. Like a thousand hands pressing down on me from all sides. An unnatural feeling, almost like a sixth sense. A sense of danger.

I needed to get out of this city. Now. Something was wrong here.

I started jogging towards an intersection I could see in the distance. There had to be more in this city than the houses surrounding me. Maybe I could find a way out by myself.

Passing by an alley, I caught a glimpse of something that may have been a large rat scurrying away. I didn't stop to look.

Once I reached the three-way intersection, I could see down the two streets that branched off to the sides.

More houses. I must have been in the suburbs of the city, and I had no idea which direction would get me out of them.

It was time to explore one of the houses. There might be a clue to where I was. Aside from that, I was curious to see if people had ever lived here.

Walking up to the brick house facing the intersection, I stopped in front of its plain wooden door.

Not expecting an answer, I knocked. It was better to be safe in case someone was actually in there.

To my surprise, someone answered.

*""Come in!""* a jovial man's voice called out from inside. *""Please, come in! I can't come to the door!""*

Slightly relieved to hear a friendly voice in this oppressive place, I opened the door and went in.

What I saw when I entered the foyer was refreshingly normal: a small coat rack, shoes on the floor, a mat to wipe your feet, and an umbrella resting next to the door. I could see the living room ahead of me. These houses weren't abandoned after all. I closed the front door.

""Please, make yourself comfortable!"" the boisterous voice exclaimed from a different room. ""You'll have to forgive me, I wasn't expecting guests! You caught me making dinner— please, just take a seat in the living room.""

His voice had an overwhelming charisma to it. I felt like this guy made friends as easily as he breathed. Someone who could make anyone laugh—who brightened a room just by their presence. I could almost hear his smile.

""Thank you!"" I called out as I stepped into the living room. ""I'm a bit lost, and could use some help.""

""Of course!"" he replied. I heard sounds of cutlery. ""Always happy to help someone in need. Just a moment!""

I took in the living room as I waited. I still felt uneasy, but what I saw calmed me down a bit.

There were two small couches facing each other in the center of the room. Glass coffee tables topped with ashtrays were in front of both. Lining the walls were bookcases and landscape paintings, and the wall facing the street had two windows.

It was a perfect room to relax and socialize with others, which fit the general impression I had of my host.

Behind me, I heard a noise.

I turned around—and recoiled in horror.

He was standing in a doorway, holding a butcher's cleaver.

It wasn't the cleaver that frightened me. It was his face. Or the lack of one. He had no eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, a vertical opening full of bristling, razor-sharp teeth split his face in two.

I jumped backwards and screamed, ""GET BACK!"" This was a nightmare. ""GET AWAY FROM ME!""

He took a step forward.

""Please, relax,"" he said in a comforting voice. His ""mouth"" quivered hideously as he spoke. ""Don't worry. I'm here to help you.""

My body was shaking from fear. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't think.

""STOP!"" I shouted frantically as I took another step back. I had to do something. I had to do something *now*.

I put my right hand behind my back. ""I'LL SHOOT YOU!"" I screamed, voice cracking. ""I HAVE A GUN!"" It was a bluff, but I wished it were true. I desperately needed the gun right now.

Suddenly, my right hand was weighed down, wrapping around a familiar grip.

Not questioning this miracle, I pulled the black revolver from behind my back and quickly leveled it at him.

""DON'T MOVE!"" I yelled. The gun wasn't loaded, but I prayed it was enough to scare him off.

He cocked his head to the side as he considered the large revolver trained on him. ""This is just a big misunderstanding,"" he said, reasonably. He shrugged and held out the cleaver. ""It's not what it looks like.""

He took another step forward.

I hesitated.

Faster than I could blink, he lunged at me.

With a merciless swing of his cleaver, he chopped off my right hand, sending it flying. The revolver disappeared.

*""AAAAHHHHHH!""* I cried out in shock and terror—the pain hadn't hit me yet—as I stumbled backwards, my hand replaced by a geyser of blood. I tripped on a coffee table and crashed through it, shattering the glass and landing on my back.

The monster wasn't wasting time—he immediately recovered from his brutal attack and jumped forward to finish me off.

His cleaver was raised high as he bore down on me. His vertical maw was fully opened, revealing dozens of viciously sharp teeth. He was eerily silent as he brought the cleaver down.

My death was imminent. My thoughts were frozen by fear. I screamed, watching the smooth arc of his cleaver as it approached my face. I uselessly put up my remaining hand to protect myself, even as I realized it was futile.

I acted by reflex.

The black revolver appeared in my left hand and I pulled the trigger.

**—BOOM—**

All of the furniture in the room exploded into a hail of splinters. The windows shattered. The floor cracked around me and the building shook. The air in the room became a gale as it fled in terror. It was so loud that my eardrums should have burst. It was so bright that my retinas should have fried. It was so powerful that the recoil should have ripped my arm off.

A path of annihilation about two feet wide began at the muzzle of the barrel and ended in the sky, which was now visible through the gaping hole in the ceiling. Everything in that path had turned to dust.

Half of the monster's body had simply disappeared. The rest became a spray of gore and bloody mist from the muzzle blast, splattering around the room. His cleaver—inches from my face—was thrown from his obliterated fingers, and its mangled remnants were embedded into one of the brick walls.

Shell-shocked, I lurched to my feet. I staggered to the front door before the dust could settle. The stump of my missing right hand was still bleeding—the pain creeping in—and I pressed it into my left armpit. My revolver hung heavy by my side as I gripped it tight.

I threw the front door open—and froze. My ragged breath caught. What I saw had stopped me cold.

Blood from my wound rolled down my good arm, my white-knuckled hand, the revolver, and dripped to the ground as I took it all in.

Demons. That was the only way I could describe them. They were completely surrounding the empty intersection in front of me.

A horde. An army. Filling the streets. Crowding shoulder-to-shoulder, as far as the eye could see. Demons.

Most were the split-faced monstrosities like the one I had just killed, but I could see other kinds scattered among them.

I saw dozens of skinless people, slick with blood and frightening with their rictus grins. Exposed muscles visibly coiled and uncoiled with every movement. They twitched erratically and their lidless stares were hungry.

Some jumbled masses of writhing tentacles the size of dogs were floating a few feet off the ground. They bobbed up and down in a bizarre rhythm, and I couldn't tell how deadly they were.

Two or three tall, thin humanoids resembling stick figures towered over the demons near them. Their spindly, long arms narrowed down to evil points that could easily spear through a chest. Where a face should have been was an empty cavity that exposed their hollow heads.

I saw at least one gigantic spider, larger than a bear, with no eyes. It was pale, hairy, and had huge, arm-length fangs. Disgusting holes covered its entire body, and countless ""baby"" spiders—the size of tarantulas—were crawling in and out of them.

There were more, but my concentration was broken.

Whispers.

I didn't hear them with my ears. The whispers were in my head. An insidious susurration of seemingly thousands of people. None of it made sense—it was maddening. It was impossible to ignore. I could tell, somehow, that they were coming from behind me, on the other side of the house.

At that same moment, the dread I was feeling from every direction suddenly spiked from the place the whispers originated. I knew instinctively that it was far more dangerous than every demon in front of me combined. The whispers were getting louder.

I ran away from it to the only place I could: the empty intersection. None of the demons made a move on me.

When I looked behind me and over the house—

I saw it. It was flying. It was gigantic.

And it was the single most terrifying thing I had ever seen in my entire life. My heart thundered in my ears.

I didn't even think. I raised the revolver and fired three times.

**—BOOM—** An explosion of light broke the darkness. Cobblestone on the ground shook loose in front of me. Dust went flying across the street.

**—BOOM—** Pieces of cobblestone were thrown so forcefully by the muzzle blast that they became projectiles; windows shattered and demons raised arms to defend themselves.

**—BOOM—** A maelstrom surrounded me as the air desperately kept trying to return, only to be blown away once again. Dirt under the stripped cobblestone was kicked up into the air.

Silence. The whispers stopped. Dust swirled, obscuring my vision.

*I killed it,* I thought, praying. *Please let it be dead.*

The dust settled.

It was completely unharmed.

The *thing* flying in the air defied description. It was an abomination. Even the smallest attempt to understand its form would impart a lifetime of crippling nightmares. It was anathema to the human mind.

If I had to define it in that moment, I would say that it was vaguely humanoid in shape. It had an uncountable number of tendrils surrounding it that seemed to phase in and out of existence in a meaningless pattern. I couldn't describe what color the tendrils were or what they were made of, because I had never seen any color or material like it before. It was alien.

None of that was noteworthy compared to the center of its body.

There, I saw the Abyss.

A maw of Hell.

It wasn't black. It was Nothing. An unfathomable absence. It was the opposite of looking at the Sun. It didn't overwhelm the eyes. It took from them. It stole something from the mind. In that moment, I knew that the gun was protecting me somehow. I knew that if a normal person had looked directly into that void, they would have instantly gone insane. A slave to unspeakable madness— forever.

The silence was broken.

***FRAGMENT BEARER***

I screamed. A sickening spike of pure agony was being driven behind my eyes. The *thing*'s whispers had combined into an infernal roar.

***ASPIRANT TO THE ASHEN THRONE***

I felt like my skull was going to shatter. It was a cacophony of the damned; a million raging souls, piercing my mind.

***WE REJECT THY CLAIM***

""WAIT!"" I managed to cry out, pushing through the pain. This *thing* seemed to be intelligent, and I was desperate. ""YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG—""

***PERISH***

I was in the center of a three-way intersection, at the top of the ""T"", with one street ahead of me and the others on my left and right.

All three streets were choked with demons.

Every single one of them came for me at the same time.

I was too numb from everything happening to freeze in terror. I felt it—as I watched hundreds, maybe even thousands of demons charging, I felt it—but in that split second, all that mattered was survival.

I wasn't going to double back into the house. Letting that *thing* get to me would be worse than death. I was absolutely certain of this. At that moment, it was slowly flying towards me. My only option was to get away from it.

Through the demons.

**—BOOM—** Like a wave parting the sea, I shot a massive hole straight ahead down the street. The demons who weren't hit were thrown or tripped up as their friends exploded next to them.

I ran forwards and to the right, toward a backyard wall on the corner. My right arm was making it hard to run. I had to keep it pressed against me or I'd bleed out. My shirt was already soaked with blood.

**—BOOM—** Light and thunder erupted from the revolver as demons to my right stopped existing. Even though I shot with my left hand, the gun was so powerful that I only had to aim in their general direction.

The path ahead was now clear, but I was still being chased from behind. I needed to move, fast.

**—BOOM—** I shot through the wall in front of me, reducing it to rubble.

My hastily made plan was to shoot through the backyard wall, run around the house, and keep going from there.

However, I underestimated the black revolver. It shot through the wall *and* the house. And the house across the street. And the wall behind that. And the house behind that...

**—BOOM—** Windows shattered into a million pieces. **—BOOM—** Bricks turned to dust. **—BOOM—** Wood exploded into splinters.

I enlarged the hole so that I could run in a straight line through everything. I twisted as I ran—almost tripping—and fired behind me to slow down my pursuers. **—BOOM—** I didn't have time to see the results.

I ran. Through houses, backyards, and streets—I ran. My breath was getting heavier. Pain and blood loss were hitting me now. The whispers were still loud in my head. I was miserable, and I had to force my legs to keep moving. Only fear and my will to live kept me going.

I was shooting behind me to keep the demons off, trying to get a lead on them. I almost collapsed a wall and buried myself when I fired next to it, but my plan was otherwise working. I was going to escape.

I was running through another house when a skinless man hiding in a bedroom lunged at me.

My reaction time was impaired by blood loss and overexertion, so I couldn't dodge. He knocked me off my feet and his sharp talons raked across my face. I was so tired. My gun was wedged between us, so when I pulled the trigger **—BOOM—** he turned to paste.

I grit my teeth, painfully rose to my feet, and made it out of the house.

Demons were waiting. They were flooding the street and the houses in front of me.

They had cut me off. I was surrounded. I couldn't run any longer.

Panicking, I began firing wildly. **—BOOM—** A dozen demons died. **—BOOM—** I missed, and the front of a house exploded, raining bricks. **—BOOM—** A demon jumping at me from the side was blown apart by the muzzle blast. **—BOOM—** Another miss, this one hitting the sky. **—BOOM—** It directly impacted the cobblestone street, sending rocky shrapnel flying and shredding nearby demons. The hole it created went all the way down to bedrock.

I cleared an area in the middle of the street and staggered over to it.

I swung around like a madman, shooting, trying to keep the demons away. They were trickling in faster now, from all directions. I couldn't do this forever.

*I have to get out,* I thought, despairing. *I have to find a way out.*

**—BOOM—** Demons emerging from an alley were blown away, along with half of the alley itself.

*How did I even get here?* My thoughts were all over the place as dust and destruction filled my vision. *What did I do?*

There was a brief moment of respite as I thinned out the approaching horde.

*Was it just because I picked up the gun?* I was concentrating on this problem like my life depended on it—because it did. *Was it because I looked in the cylinder?*

Something appeared down the street. It was some kind of disturbingly-shaped person.

**—BOOM—**

It kept running.

*I must have missed,* I thought.

**—BOOM—** My finger was numb on the trigger. **—BOOM—** I steadied my aim. **—BOOM—**

I didn't miss.

It wasn't stopping, and it was getting larger. I could see it clearly now.

It wasn't the size of a normal man. It was a titan. As tall as a house, and half as wide. It looked incredibly muscular, but I suddenly realized why its shape was so odd.

It was made out of faces.

An abomination, comprised of nothing but human faces at different angles to each other. All of them with their eyes and mouths hideously open, as if they were trapped in an eternal scream of fear. Its fingers were human tongues, overlapping and quivering.

My bullets—or whatever the revolver was firing—only scratched it, drawing a pathetic amount of blood.

It was fast. Too fast to outrun.

The whispers were getting louder. The *thing* was also closing in.

I was shaking again and paralyzed in horror when I suddenly remembered something.

*I said 'what the hell',* I realized. *I got here after I said the word 'hell'.* I snapped out of my frozen state.

""TAKE ME BACK!"" I shouted, praying I could say something that would let me escape.

The army of demons had been gathering together behind the houses, and now they swarmed at me in a tidal wave of death.

**—BOOM—** ""TAKE ME—"" I frantically swung around in every direction, trying to kill the faster ones before they could reach me. **—BOOM—** —HOME!"" I screamed.

The many-faced nightmare was five houses away. I could see the *thing* in the air out of the corner of my eye; its whispers were becoming screams.

""TAKE—"" **—BOOM—** I was mowing demons down, my finger flickering on the trigger. **—BOOM—** By the tens. **—BOOM—** By the hundreds.

""—ME—"" **—BOOM—** I was surrounded by a crater formed by the revolver's apocalyptic power. **—BOOM—** Every shot shook the world. **—BOOM—** Blood fell like rain.

""—TO—"" **—BOOM—** Demons were closing in on all sides. **—BOOM—** The titan jumped for me, tongued fingers extended. **—BOOM—** A tendril melted into existence and whipped at my throat. **—BOOM—**

I cried out desperately, *""—EARTH!""*

Instantly, I was back in the desert. The stars shone down from the night sky overhead.

I fell to my knees, and my outstretched hand, white-knuckling the revolver, fell limp at my side. A sudden wave of exhaustion hit me. Combined with the exhaustion I had already been feeling, I was about to pass out.

Dismissing the revolver—I could do it as easily as breathing now—I crawled over to my pack, which was still on the ground next to the pile of ash.

I was too tired to be alarmed by the scorpion crawling over it. I flicked it off and rested my head on the backpack. My stump was—mercifully—no longer bleeding.

Drenched in demon blood, I lost consciousness.

When I woke the next morning, I pushed myself up.

With my right hand.

---

The hike back to the trailhead was easy. Too easy. In fact, I felt better the longer I walked. Something about the gun had improved my body and senses.

My legs didn't ache, I didn't sweat, and I didn't have to drink as much water. I could see and hear much farther than before, and in greater clarity. I felt like I could look at the Sun without going blind, but I didn't try.

Only after I drove back to my house—and washed off the filth covering me—could I finally relax. Never had I felt such relief at coming home. Everything I had been through could almost be written off as a horrifying nightmare. I restrained myself from summoning the black revolver.

My new hand is a constant reminder of the truth, however. It's stronger. Much stronger. As I sit here, I have to be careful with the keys on the keyboard. I shattered my coffee cup this morning by accident when I picked it up.

It's warm to the touch, and looks different too. It's less... skin-like. It has a weird texture that reminds me of scales. And it has a slightly red color. A subtle dark red that fades in a gradient as it approaches the skin tone of my wrist.

I don't know what's happening to me, but I know the revolver is responsible. After reflecting on my experiences, I know that I've been wrapped up in some kind of struggle for a ""throne."" Whose throne? I was sent to that place when I said ""hell,"" so I'm afraid I already know the answer.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do now. I thought I could simply put all of this behind me...

...but in the last thirty minutes, I've started to feel that unnatural sense of dread—of danger—from somewhere far away. That feeling is growing.

1q18977,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q18977/the_devils_revolver/,The Devil's Revolver,"On the fourth day of my six-day backpacking trip through the Mojave Desert, I saw a pile of ash off the beaten path.

Old campfire sites are a common sight on a multi-day hike, but something about this one caught my eye.

A reflective black rock was resting on top of the ash. It looked like a meteorite. Curious, I approached and picked it up. It was small enough to hold in one hand, and slightly warm to the touch.

Immediately, I realized it was a tablet. Not the new kind of tablet, obviously, but an ancient-looking stone tablet with writing on it.

The engraving was in a dark red—slightly lighter than the pitch-black stone it was engraved on—and almost seemed to glow in the scorching midday sun. It didn't seem to be in English, but, oddly, I could read its message easily. Somehow, its text became perfectly legible when I concentrated on the strange letters.

This was what I read:

---

-TYRANT UPON THY THRONE-

-SOVEREIGN OF NOTHING-

-MAY DEATH AND ASH-

-HERALD THY RETURN-

---

I looked down at the ominous stone tablet, uneasy. It creeped me out.

*Who left this here?* I wondered, unsettled. *What a bizarre find.*

I shrugged, put it in my pack, and was about to walk away when I saw something else.

Removing the tablet revealed something beneath. I brushed the ash off—without picking it up—to see what it was.

A gun.

I gazed down, incredulously, at a huge, black revolver. A veritable hand cannon that seemed to be made out of the same meteorite as the tablet. The grip was a cloudy gray and blended in with the ash. It looked unique— and *extremely* expensive.

Now this was an *incredible* find. Who would leave a collector's gun in the ashes of a campfire?

I wiped the sweat from my eyes, took a swig of water from my canteen, and dropped my backpack off to the side. This deserved my full attention.

Crouching down, I wrapped my right hand around the grip of the revolver and carefully pulled it from the ash.

It was heavy, but felt perfect in my hand. In fact, I felt better just by holding it. My fatigue from walking in the blistering heat started to fade away. I couldn't feel the soreness in my legs. My thoughts were clearer.

I wasn't a gun nut or anything, but my friends had taken me to a shooting range a few times, so I knew how to use one. I thumbed the cylinder release and flicked my wrist to swing it out.

There were six chambers in the revolver's cylinder, and none of them were loaded... but one chamber was dark. A strange shadow where a bullet would have been. I couldn't see my hand through the chamber when I waved it on the other side. *Weird,* I thought.

I swung the cylinder shut and held the mysterious revolver in my hand for another minute, just enjoying the feel of it. It really was a nice gun, and I was definitely taking it with me. Maybe I'd become a gun nut after all. I went to put it in my pack.

With my hand inside the backpack, I tried to let go of the revolver.

I couldn't let go.

*Huh?*

I tried shaking it out of my hand. It wouldn't come off.

Panicking, I took my right hand out of the pack and tried to pry the gun off with my left.

*Is it covered in glue?* I thought, increasingly concerned for the skin of my palm. *Why can't I let go?*

I sat down and struggled with it, gritting my teeth as I tried to free my hand.

*Come on,* I thought, muscles straining. *Get off. Get off! GET. OFF—*

The revolver disappeared.

My left arm was almost dislocated as the object I was pulling on stopped existing.

I blinked.

I raised my empty right hand.

I stared at it.

I slowly opened and closed it a few times.

Silence.

""What the hell—""

The sun disappeared and everything plunged into darkness.

""—is going on?"" I said to myself, before jumping to my feet in shock. Adrenaline flooded my body, overpowering a sudden wave of exhaustion that hit me at the same time.

The desert was gone; I stood on cobblestone. The sunlight was gone; it was pitch dark.

I was somewhere else.

I froze for a moment, dumbfounded, as my brain tried to process all of the impossible things happening to me.

My hands were shaking. I was hyperventilating.

*What...* I thought slowly, *...what just happened?*

I was freaking out.

*Where is the gun?*

*Where is my backpack?*

*Where did the desert go?*

The most important question occurred to me.

*Where am I?*

I whipped my head around in every direction.

*WHERE AM I?!* My heart was racing.

It looked like I was in the middle of a deserted city, on a cobblestone street lined with old, weathered brick houses. There were no sidewalks, telephone wires, light poles, or anything a modern city would have. It was like I had gone backwards through time.

There were no lights anywhere. No fires, no lanterns, no lit windows. It was a ghost town.

I looked up, and saw only darkness. No stars, no moon. Nothing. It was just pitch black, *everywhere*. I didn't know how I was even able to see, but I wasn't in the state of mind to dwell on that.

*Am I underground?* I thought, still panicking. *Why am I here? HOW?!*

I was overwhelmed. It was too much. What was I going to do?

I doubled over, hands on my knees, trying to control my breathing. I needed to calm down. I needed to figure this out. There was a rational explanation... somewhere. I had to find it.

After a minute, I had mostly recovered. I took my hands from my knees and straightened up.

My first thought was to look for help. I needed someone to tell me where I was. They could give me directions, and possibly an explanation for how I got here.

*""Hello?""* I called out tentatively, praying that this city wasn't truly abandoned. *""Is anyone there?""*

Dead silence.

An unnatural chill went down my spine.

Dread. I felt it growing from every direction. Like a thousand hands pressing down on me from all sides. An unnatural feeling, almost like a sixth sense. A sense of danger.

I needed to get out of this city. Now. Something was wrong here.

I started jogging towards an intersection I could see in the distance. There had to be more in this city than the houses surrounding me. Maybe I could find a way out by myself.

Passing by an alley, I caught a glimpse of something that may have been a large rat scurrying away. I didn't stop to look.

Once I reached the three-way intersection, I could see down the two streets that branched off to the sides.

More houses. I must have been in the suburbs of the city, and I had no idea which direction would get me out of them.

It was time to explore one of the houses. There might be a clue to where I was. Aside from that, I was curious to see if people had ever lived here.

Walking up to the brick house facing the intersection, I stopped in front of its plain wooden door.

Not expecting an answer, I knocked. It was better to be safe in case someone was actually in there.

To my surprise, someone answered.

*""Come in!""* a jovial man's voice called out from inside. *""Please, come in! I can't come to the door!""*

Slightly relieved to hear a friendly voice in this oppressive place, I opened the door and went in.

What I saw when I entered the foyer was refreshingly normal: a small coat rack, shoes on the floor, a mat to wipe your feet, and an umbrella resting next to the door. I could see the living room ahead of me. These houses weren't abandoned after all. I closed the front door.

""Please, make yourself comfortable!"" the boisterous voice exclaimed from a different room. ""You'll have to forgive me, I wasn't expecting guests! You caught me making dinner— please, just take a seat in the living room.""

His voice had an overwhelming charisma to it. I felt like this guy made friends as easily as he breathed. Someone who could make anyone laugh—who brightened a room just by their presence. I could almost hear his smile.

""Thank you!"" I called out as I stepped into the living room. ""I'm a bit lost, and could use some help.""

""Of course!"" he replied. I heard sounds of cutlery. ""Always happy to help someone in need. Just a moment!""

I took in the living room as I waited. I still felt uneasy, but what I saw calmed me down a bit.

There were two small couches facing each other in the center of the room. Glass coffee tables topped with ashtrays were in front of both. Lining the walls were bookcases and landscape paintings, and the wall facing the street had two windows.

It was a perfect room to relax and socialize with others, which fit the general impression I had of my host.

Behind me, I heard a noise.

I turned around—and recoiled in horror.

He was standing in a doorway, holding a butcher's cleaver.

It wasn't the cleaver that frightened me. It was his face. Or the lack of one. He had no eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, a vertical opening full of bristling, razor-sharp teeth split his face in two.

I jumped backwards and screamed, ""GET BACK!"" This was a nightmare. ""GET AWAY FROM ME!""

He took a step forward.

""Please, relax,"" he said in a comforting voice. His ""mouth"" quivered hideously as he spoke. ""Don't worry. I'm here to help you.""

My body was shaking from fear. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't think.

""STOP!"" I shouted frantically as I took another step back. I had to do something. I had to do something *now*.

I put my right hand behind my back. ""I'LL SHOOT YOU!"" I screamed, voice cracking. ""I HAVE A GUN!"" It was a bluff, but I wished it were true. I desperately needed the gun right now.

Suddenly, my right hand was weighed down, wrapping around a familiar grip.

Not questioning this miracle, I pulled the black revolver from behind my back and quickly leveled it at him.

""DON'T MOVE!"" I yelled. The gun wasn't loaded, but I prayed it was enough to scare him off.

He cocked his head to the side as he considered the large revolver trained on him. ""This is just a big misunderstanding,"" he said, reasonably. He shrugged and held out the cleaver. ""It's not what it looks like.""

He took another step forward.

I hesitated.

Faster than I could blink, he lunged at me.

With a merciless swing of his cleaver, he chopped off my right hand, sending it flying. The revolver disappeared.

*""AAAAHHHHHH!""* I cried out in shock and terror—the pain hadn't hit me yet—as I stumbled backwards, my hand replaced by a geyser of blood. I tripped on a coffee table and crashed through it, shattering the glass and landing on my back.

The monster wasn't wasting time—he immediately recovered from his brutal attack and jumped forward to finish me off.

His cleaver was raised high as he bore down on me. His vertical maw was fully opened, revealing dozens of viciously sharp teeth. He was eerily silent as he brought the cleaver down.

My death was imminent. My thoughts were frozen by fear. I screamed, watching the smooth arc of his cleaver as it approached my face. I uselessly put up my remaining hand to protect myself, even as I realized it was futile.

I acted by reflex.

The black revolver appeared in my left hand and I pulled the trigger.

**—BOOM—**

All of the furniture in the room exploded into a hail of splinters. The windows shattered. The floor cracked around me and the building shook. The air in the room became a gale as it fled in terror. It was so loud that my eardrums should have burst. It was so bright that my retinas should have fried. It was so powerful that the recoil should have ripped my arm off.

A path of annihilation about two feet wide began at the muzzle of the barrel and ended in the sky, which was now visible through the gaping hole in the ceiling. Everything in that path had turned to dust.

Half of the monster's body had simply disappeared. The rest became a spray of gore and bloody mist from the muzzle blast, splattering around the room. His cleaver—inches from my face—was thrown from his obliterated fingers, and its mangled remnants were embedded into one of the brick walls.

Shell-shocked, I lurched to my feet. I staggered to the front door before the dust could settle. The stump of my missing right hand was still bleeding—the pain creeping in—and I pressed it into my left armpit. My revolver hung heavy by my side as I gripped it tight.

I threw the front door open—and froze. My ragged breath caught. What I saw had stopped me cold.

Blood from my wound rolled down my good arm, my white-knuckled hand, the revolver, and dripped to the ground as I took it all in.

Demons. That was the only way I could describe them. They were completely surrounding the empty intersection in front of me.

A horde. An army. Filling the streets. Crowding shoulder-to-shoulder, as far as the eye could see. Demons.

Most were the split-faced monstrosities like the one I had just killed, but I could see other kinds scattered among them.

I saw dozens of skinless people, slick with blood and frightening with their rictus grins. Exposed muscles visibly coiled and uncoiled with every movement. They twitched erratically and their lidless stares were hungry.

Some jumbled masses of writhing tentacles the size of dogs were floating a few feet off the ground. They bobbed up and down in a bizarre rhythm, and I couldn't tell how deadly they were.

Two or three tall, thin humanoids resembling stick figures towered over the demons near them. Their spindly, long arms narrowed down to evil points that could easily spear through a chest. Where a face should have been was an empty cavity that exposed their hollow heads.

I saw at least one gigantic spider, larger than a bear, with no eyes. It was pale, hairy, and had huge, arm-length fangs. Disgusting holes covered its entire body, and countless ""baby"" spiders—the size of tarantulas—were crawling in and out of them.

There were more, but my concentration was broken.

Whispers.

I didn't hear them with my ears. The whispers were in my head. An insidious susurration of seemingly thousands of people. None of it made sense—it was maddening. It was impossible to ignore. I could tell, somehow, that they were coming from behind me, on the other side of the house.

At that same moment, the dread I was feeling from every direction suddenly spiked from the place the whispers originated. I knew instinctively that it was far more dangerous than every demon in front of me combined. The whispers were getting louder.

I ran away from it to the only place I could: the empty intersection. None of the demons made a move on me.

When I looked behind me and over the house—

I saw it. It was flying. It was gigantic.

And it was the single most terrifying thing I had ever seen in my entire life. My heart thundered in my ears.

I didn't even think. I raised the revolver and fired three times.

**—BOOM—** An explosion of light broke the darkness. Cobblestone on the ground shook loose in front of me. Dust went flying across the street.

**—BOOM—** Pieces of cobblestone were thrown so forcefully by the muzzle blast that they became projectiles; windows shattered and demons raised arms to defend themselves.

**—BOOM—** A maelstrom surrounded me as the air desperately kept trying to return, only to be blown away once again. Dirt under the stripped cobblestone was kicked up into the air.

Silence. The whispers stopped. Dust swirled, obscuring my vision.

*I killed it,* I thought, praying. *Please let it be dead.*

The dust settled.

It was completely unharmed.

The *thing* flying in the air defied description. It was an abomination. Even the smallest attempt to understand its form would impart a lifetime of crippling nightmares. It was anathema to the human mind.

If I had to define it in that moment, I would say that it was vaguely humanoid in shape. It had an uncountable number of tendrils surrounding it that seemed to phase in and out of existence in a meaningless pattern. I couldn't describe what color the tendrils were or what they were made of, because I had never seen any color or material like it before. It was alien.

None of that was noteworthy compared to the center of its body.

There, I saw the Abyss.

A maw of Hell.

It wasn't black. It was Nothing. An unfathomable absence. It was the opposite of looking at the Sun. It didn't overwhelm the eyes. It took from them. It stole something from the mind. In that moment, I knew that the gun was protecting me somehow. I knew that if a normal person had looked directly into that void, they would have instantly gone insane. A slave to unspeakable madness— forever.

The silence was broken.

***FRAGMENT BEARER***

I screamed. A sickening spike of pure agony was being driven behind my eyes. The *thing*'s whispers had combined into an infernal roar.

***ASPIRANT TO THE ASHEN THRONE***

I felt like my skull was going to shatter. It was a cacophony of the damned; a million raging souls, piercing my mind.

***WE REJECT THY CLAIM***

""WAIT!"" I managed to cry out, pushing through the pain. This *thing* seemed to be intelligent, and I was desperate. ""YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG—""

***PERISH***

I was in the center of a three-way intersection, at the top of the ""T"", with one street ahead of me and the others on my left and right.

All three streets were choked with demons.

Every single one of them came for me at the same time.

I was too numb from everything happening to freeze in terror. I felt it—as I watched hundreds, maybe even thousands of demons charging, I felt it—but in that split second, all that mattered was survival.

I wasn't going to double back into the house. Letting that *thing* get to me would be worse than death. I was absolutely certain of this. At that moment, it was slowly flying towards me. My only option was to get away from it.

Through the demons.

**—BOOM—** Like a wave parting the sea, I shot a massive hole straight ahead down the street. The demons who weren't hit were thrown or tripped up as their friends exploded next to them.

I ran forwards and to the right, toward a backyard wall on the corner. My right arm was making it hard to run. I had to keep it pressed against me or I'd bleed out. My shirt was already soaked with blood.

**—BOOM—** Light and thunder erupted from the revolver as demons to my right stopped existing. Even though I shot with my left hand, the gun was so powerful that I only had to aim in their general direction.

The path ahead was now clear, but I was still being chased from behind. I needed to move, fast.

**—BOOM—** I shot through the wall in front of me, reducing it to rubble.

My hastily made plan was to shoot through the backyard wall, run around the house, and keep going from there.

However, I underestimated the black revolver. It shot through the wall *and* the house. And the house across the street. And the wall behind that. And the house behind that...

**—BOOM—** Windows shattered into a million pieces. **—BOOM—** Bricks turned to dust. **—BOOM—** Wood exploded into splinters.

I enlarged the hole so that I could run in a straight line through everything. I twisted as I ran—almost tripping—and fired behind me to slow down my pursuers. **—BOOM—** I didn't have time to see the results.

I ran. Through houses, backyards, and streets—I ran. My breath was getting heavier. Pain and blood loss were hitting me now. The whispers were still loud in my head. I was miserable, and I had to force my legs to keep moving. Only fear and my will to live kept me going.

I was shooting behind me to keep the demons off, trying to get a lead on them. I almost collapsed a wall and buried myself when I fired next to it, but my plan was otherwise working. I was going to escape.

I was running through another house when a skinless man hiding in a bedroom lunged at me.

My reaction time was impaired by blood loss and overexertion, so I couldn't dodge. He knocked me off my feet and his sharp talons raked across my face. I was so tired. My gun was wedged between us, so when I pulled the trigger **—BOOM—** he turned to paste.

I grit my teeth, painfully rose to my feet, and made it out of the house.

Demons were waiting. They were flooding the street and the houses in front of me.

They had cut me off. I was surrounded. I couldn't run any longer.

Panicking, I began firing wildly. **—BOOM—** A dozen demons died. **—BOOM—** I missed, and the front of a house exploded, raining bricks. **—BOOM—** A demon jumping at me from the side was blown apart by the muzzle blast. **—BOOM—** Another miss, this one hitting the sky. **—BOOM—** It directly impacted the cobblestone street, sending rocky shrapnel flying and shredding nearby demons. The hole it created went all the way down to bedrock.

I cleared an area in the middle of the street and staggered over to it.

I swung around like a madman, shooting, trying to keep the demons away. They were trickling in faster now, from all directions. I couldn't do this forever.

*I have to get out,* I thought, despairing. *I have to find a way out.*

**—BOOM—** Demons emerging from an alley were blown away, along with half of the alley itself.

*How did I even get here?* My thoughts were all over the place as dust and destruction filled my vision. *What did I do?*

There was a brief moment of respite as I thinned out the approaching horde.

*Was it just because I picked up the gun?* I was concentrating on this problem like my life depended on it—because it did. *Was it because I looked in the cylinder?*

Something appeared down the street. It was some kind of disturbingly-shaped person.

**—BOOM—**

It kept running.

*I must have missed,* I thought.

**—BOOM—** My finger was numb on the trigger. **—BOOM—** I steadied my aim. **—BOOM—**

I didn't miss.

It wasn't stopping, and it was getting larger. I could see it clearly now.

It wasn't the size of a normal man. It was a titan. As tall as a house, and half as wide. It looked incredibly muscular, but I suddenly realized why its shape was so odd.

It was made out of faces.

An abomination, comprised of nothing but human faces at different angles to each other. All of them with their eyes and mouths hideously open, as if they were trapped in an eternal scream of fear. Its fingers were human tongues, overlapping and quivering.

My bullets—or whatever the revolver was firing—only scratched it, drawing a pathetic amount of blood.

It was fast. Too fast to outrun.

The whispers were getting louder. The *thing* was also closing in.

I was shaking again and paralyzed in horror when I suddenly remembered something.

*I said 'what the hell',* I realized. *I got here after I said the word 'hell'.* I snapped out of my frozen state.

""TAKE ME BACK!"" I shouted, praying I could say something that would let me escape.

The army of demons had been gathering together behind the houses, and now they swarmed at me in a tidal wave of death.

**—BOOM—** ""TAKE ME—"" I frantically swung around in every direction, trying to kill the faster ones before they could reach me. **—BOOM—** —HOME!"" I screamed.

The many-faced nightmare was five houses away. I could see the *thing* in the air out of the corner of my eye; its whispers were becoming screams.

""TAKE—"" **—BOOM—** I was mowing demons down, my finger flickering on the trigger. **—BOOM—** By the tens. **—BOOM—** By the hundreds.

""—ME—"" **—BOOM—** I was surrounded by a crater formed by the revolver's apocalyptic power. **—BOOM—** Every shot shook the world. **—BOOM—** Blood fell like rain.

""—TO—"" **—BOOM—** Demons were closing in on all sides. **—BOOM—** The titan jumped for me, tongued fingers extended. **—BOOM—** A tendril melted into existence and whipped at my throat. **—BOOM—**

I cried out desperately, *""—EARTH!""*

Instantly, I was back in the desert. The stars shone down from the night sky overhead.

I fell to my knees, and my outstretched hand, white-knuckling the revolver, fell limp at my side. A sudden wave of exhaustion hit me. Combined with the exhaustion I had already been feeling, I was about to pass out.

Dismissing the revolver—I could do it as easily as breathing now—I crawled over to my pack, which was still on the ground next to the pile of ash.

I was too tired to be alarmed by the scorpion crawling over it. I flicked it off and rested my head on the backpack. My stump was—mercifully—no longer bleeding.

Drenched in demon blood, I lost consciousness.

When I woke the next morning, I pushed myself up.

With my right hand.

A gun.

I gazed down, incredulously, at a huge, black revolver. A veritable hand cannon that seemed to be made out of the same meteorite as the tablet. The grip was a cloudy gray and blended in with the ash. It looked unique— and *extremely* expensive.

Now this was an *incredible* find. Who would leave a collector's gun in the ashes of a campfire?

I wiped the sweat from my eyes, took a swig of water from my canteen, and dropped my backpack off to the side. This deserved my full attention.

Crouching down, I wrapped my right hand around the grip of the revolver and carefully pulled it from the ash.

It was heavy, but felt perfect in my hand. In fact, I felt better just by holding it. My fatigue from walking in the blistering heat started to fade away. I couldn't feel the soreness in my legs. My thoughts were clearer.

I wasn't a gun nut or anything, but my friends had taken me to a shooting range a few times, so I knew how to use one. I thumbed the cylinder release and flicked my wrist to swing it out.

There were six chambers in the revolver's cylinder, and none of them were loaded... but one chamber was dark. A strange shadow where a bullet would have been. I couldn't see my hand through the chamber when I waved it on the other side. *Weird,* I thought.

I swung the cylinder shut and held the mysterious revolver in my hand for another minute, just enjoying the feel of it. It really was a nice gun, and I was definitely taking it with me. Maybe I'd become a gun nut after all. I went to put it in my pack.

With my hand inside the backpack, I tried to let go of the revolver.

I couldn't let go.

*Huh?*

I tried shaking it out of my hand. It wouldn't come off.

Panicking, I took my right hand out of the pack and tried to pry the gun off with my left.

*Is it covered in glue?* I thought, increasingly concerned for the skin of my palm. *Why can't I let go?*

I sat down and struggled with it, gritting my teeth as I tried to free my hand.

*Come on,* I thought, muscles straining. *Get off. Get off! GET. OFF—*

The revolver disappeared.

My left arm was almost dislocated as the object I was pulling on stopped existing.

I blinked.

I raised my empty right hand.

I stared at it.

I slowly opened and closed it a few times.

Silence.

""What the hell—""

The sun disappeared and everything plunged into darkness.

""—is going on?"" I said to myself, before jumping to my feet in shock. Adrenaline flooded my body, overpowering a sudden wave of exhaustion that hit me at the same time.

The desert was gone; I stood on cobblestone. The sunlight was gone; it was pitch dark.

I was somewhere else.

I froze for a moment, dumbfounded, as my brain tried to process all of the impossible things happening to me.

My hands were shaking. I was hyperventilating.

*What...* I thought slowly, *...what just happened?*

I was freaking out.

*Where is the gun?*

*Where is my backpack?*

*Where did the desert go?*

The most important question occurred to me.

*Where am I?*

I whipped my head around in every direction.

*WHERE AM I?!* My heart was racing.

It looked like I was in the middle of a deserted city, on a cobblestone street lined with old, weathered brick houses. There were no sidewalks, telephone wires, light poles, or anything a modern city would have. It was like I had gone backwards through time.

There were no lights anywhere. No fires, no lanterns, no lit windows. It was a ghost town.

I looked up, and saw only darkness. No stars, no moon. Nothing. It was just pitch black, *everywhere*. I didn't know how I was even able to see, but I wasn't in the state of mind to dwell on that.

*Am I underground?* I thought, still panicking. *Why am I here? HOW?!*

I was overwhelmed. It was too much. What was I going to do?

I doubled over, hands on my knees, trying to control my breathing. I needed to calm down. I needed to figure this out. There was a rational explanation... somewhere. I had to find it.

After a minute, I had mostly recovered. I took my hands from my knees and straightened up.

My first thought was to look for help. I needed someone to tell me where I was. They could give me directions, and possibly an explanation for how I got here.

*""Hello?""* I called out tentatively, praying that this city wasn't truly abandoned. *""Is anyone there?""*

Dead silence.

An unnatural chill went down my spine.

Dread. I felt it growing from every direction. Like a thousand hands pressing down on me from all sides. An unnatural feeling, almost like a sixth sense. A sense of danger.

I needed to get out of this city. Now. Something was wrong here.

I started jogging towards an intersection I could see in the distance. There had to be more in this city than the houses surrounding me. Maybe I could find a way out by myself.

Passing by an alley, I caught a glimpse of something that may have been a large rat scurrying away. I didn't stop to look.

Once I reached the three-way intersection, I could see down the two streets that branched off to the sides.

More houses. I must have been in the suburbs of the city, and I had no idea which direction would get me out of them.

It was time to explore one of the houses. There might be a clue to where I was. Aside from that, I was curious to see if people had ever lived here.

Walking up to the brick house facing the intersection, I stopped in front of its plain wooden door.

Not expecting an answer, I knocked. It was better to be safe in case someone was actually in there.

To my surprise, someone answered.

*""Come in!""* a jovial man's voice called out from inside. *""Please, come in! I can't come to the door!""*

Slightly relieved to hear a friendly voice in this oppressive place, I opened the door and went in.

What I saw when I entered the foyer was refreshingly normal: a small coat rack, shoes on the floor, a mat to wipe your feet, and an umbrella resting next to the door. I could see the living room ahead of me. These houses weren't abandoned after all. I closed the front door.

""Please, make yourself comfortable!"" the boisterous voice exclaimed from a different room. ""You'll have to forgive me, I wasn't expecting guests! You caught me making dinner— please, just take a seat in the living room.""

His voice had an overwhelming charisma to it. I felt like this guy made friends as easily as he breathed. Someone who could make anyone laugh—who brightened a room just by their presence. I could almost hear his smile.

""Thank you!"" I called out as I stepped into the living room. ""I'm a bit lost, and could use some help.""

""Of course!"" he replied. I heard sounds of cutlery. ""Always happy to help someone in need. Just a moment!""

I took in the living room as I waited. I still felt uneasy, but what I saw calmed me down a bit.

There were two small couches facing each other in the center of the room. Glass coffee tables topped with ashtrays were in front of both. Lining the walls were bookcases and landscape paintings, and the wall facing the street had two windows.

It was a perfect room to relax and socialize with others, which fit the general impression I had of my host.

Behind me, I heard a noise.

I turned around—and recoiled in horror.

He was standing in a doorway, holding a butcher's cleaver.

It wasn't the cleaver that frightened me. It was his face. Or the lack of one. He had no eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, a vertical opening full of bristling, razor-sharp teeth split his face in two.

I jumped backwards and screamed, ""GET BACK!"" This was a nightmare. ""GET AWAY FROM ME!""

He took a step forward.

""Please, relax,"" he said in a comforting voice. His ""mouth"" quivered hideously as he spoke. ""Don't worry. I'm here to help you.""

My body was shaking from fear. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't think.

""STOP!"" I shouted frantically as I took another step back. I had to do something. I had to do something *now*.

I put my right hand behind my back. ""I'LL SHOOT YOU!"" I screamed, voice cracking. ""I HAVE A GUN!"" It was a bluff, but I wished it were true. I desperately needed the gun right now.

Suddenly, my right hand was weighed down, wrapping around a familiar grip.

Not questioning this miracle, I pulled the black revolver from behind my back and quickly leveled it at him.

""DON'T MOVE!"" I yelled. The gun wasn't loaded, but I prayed it was enough to scare him off.

He cocked his head to the side as he considered the large revolver trained on him. ""This is just a big misunderstanding,"" he said, reasonably. He shrugged and held out the cleaver. ""It's not what it looks like.""

He took another step forward.

I hesitated.

Faster than I could blink, he lunged at me.

With a merciless swing of his cleaver, he chopped off my right hand, sending it flying. The revolver disappeared.

*""AAAAHHHHHH!""* I cried out in shock and terror—the pain hadn't hit me yet—as I stumbled backwards, my hand replaced by a geyser of blood. I tripped on a coffee table and crashed through it, shattering the glass and landing on my back.

The monster wasn't wasting time—he immediately recovered from his brutal attack and jumped forward to finish me off.

His cleaver was raised high as he bore down on me. His vertical maw was fully opened, revealing dozens of viciously sharp teeth. He was eerily silent as he brought the cleaver down.

My death was imminent. My thoughts were frozen by fear. I screamed, watching the smooth arc of his cleaver as it approached my face. I uselessly put up my remaining hand to protect myself, even as I realized it was futile.

I acted by reflex.

The black revolver appeared in my left hand and I pulled the trigger.

**—BOOM—**

All of the furniture in the room exploded into a hail of splinters. The windows shattered. The floor cracked around me and the building shook. The air in the room became a gale as it fled in terror. It was so loud that my eardrums should have burst. It was so bright that my retinas should have fried. It was so powerful that the recoil should have ripped my arm off.

A path of annihilation about two feet wide began at the muzzle of the barrel and ended in the sky, which was now visible through the gaping hole in the ceiling. Everything in that path had turned to dust.

Half of the monster's body had simply disappeared. The rest became a spray of gore and bloody mist from the muzzle blast, splattering around the room. His cleaver—inches from my face—was thrown from his obliterated fingers, and its mangled remnants were embedded into one of the brick walls.

Shell-shocked, I lurched to my feet. I staggered to the front door before the dust could settle. The stump of my missing right hand was still bleeding—the pain creeping in—and I pressed it into my left armpit. My revolver hung heavy by my side as I gripped it tight.

I threw the front door open—and froze. My ragged breath caught. What I saw had stopped me cold.

Blood from my wound rolled down my good arm, my white-knuckled hand, the revolver, and dripped to the ground as I took it all in.

Demons. That was the only way I could describe them. They were completely surrounding the empty intersection in front of me.

A horde. An army. Filling the streets. Crowding shoulder-to-shoulder, as far as the eye could see. Demons.

Most were the split-faced monstrosities like the one I had just killed, but I could see other kinds scattered among them.

I saw dozens of skinless people, slick with blood and frightening with their rictus grins. Exposed muscles visibly coiled and uncoiled with every movement. They twitched erratically and their lidless stares were hungry.

Some jumbled masses of writhing tentacles the size of dogs were floating a few feet off the ground. They bobbed up and down in a bizarre rhythm, and I couldn't tell how deadly they were.

Two or three tall, thin humanoids resembling stick figures towered over the demons near them. Their spindly, long arms narrowed down to evil points that could easily spear through a chest. Where a face should have been was an empty cavity that exposed their hollow heads.

I saw at least one gigantic spider, larger than a bear, with no eyes. It was pale, hairy, and had huge, arm-length fangs. Disgusting holes covered its entire body, and countless ""baby"" spiders—the size of tarantulas—were crawling in and out of them.

There were more, but my concentration was broken.

Whispers.

I didn't hear them with my ears. The whispers were in my head. An insidious susurration of seemingly thousands of people. None of it made sense—it was maddening. It was impossible to ignore. I could tell, somehow, that they were coming from behind me, on the other side of the house.

At that same moment, the dread I was feeling from every direction suddenly spiked from the place the whispers originated. I knew instinctively that it was far more dangerous than every demon in front of me combined. The whispers were getting louder.

I ran away from it to the only place I could: the empty intersection. None of the demons made a move on me.

When I looked behind me and over the house—

I saw it. It was flying. It was gigantic.

And it was the single most terrifying thing I had ever seen in my entire life. My heart thundered in my ears.

I didn't even think. I raised the revolver and fired three times.

**—BOOM—** An explosion of light broke the darkness. Cobblestone on the ground shook loose in front of me. Dust went flying across the street.

**—BOOM—** Pieces of cobblestone were thrown so forcefully by the muzzle blast that they became projectiles; windows shattered and demons raised arms to defend themselves.

**—BOOM—** A maelstrom surrounded me as the air desperately kept trying to return, only to be blown away once again. Dirt under the stripped cobblestone was kicked up into the air.

Silence. The whispers stopped. Dust swirled, obscuring my vision.

*I killed it,* I thought, praying. *Please let it be dead.*

The dust settled.

It was completely unharmed.

The *thing* flying in the air defied description. It was an abomination. Even the smallest attempt to understand its form would impart a lifetime of crippling nightmares. It was anathema to the human mind.

If I had to define it in that moment, I would say that it was vaguely humanoid in shape. It had an uncountable number of tendrils surrounding it that seemed to phase in and out of existence in a meaningless pattern. I couldn't describe what color the tendrils were or what they were made of, because I had never seen any color or material like it before. It was alien.

None of that was noteworthy compared to the center of its body.

There, I saw the Abyss.

A maw of Hell.

It wasn't black. It was Nothing. An unfathomable absence. It was the opposite of looking at the Sun. It didn't overwhelm the eyes. It took from them. It stole something from the mind. In that moment, I knew that the gun was protecting me somehow. I knew that if a normal person had looked directly into that void, they would have instantly gone insane. A slave to unspeakable madness— forever.

The silence was broken.

***FRAGMENT BEARER***

I screamed. A sickening spike of pure agony was being driven behind my eyes. The *thing*'s whispers had combined into an infernal roar.

***ASPIRANT TO THE ASHEN THRONE***

I felt like my skull was going to shatter. It was a cacophony of the damned; a million raging souls, piercing my mind.

***WE REJECT THY CLAIM***

""WAIT!"" I managed to cry out, pushing through the pain. This *thing* seemed to be intelligent, and I was desperate. ""YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG—""

***PERISH***

I was in the center of a three-way intersection, at the top of the ""T"", with one street ahead of me and the others on my left and right.

All three streets were choked with demons.

Every single one of them came for me at the same time.

I was too numb from everything happening to freeze in terror. I felt it—as I watched hundreds, maybe even thousands of demons charging, I felt it—but in that split second, all that mattered was survival.

I wasn't going to double back into the house. Letting that *thing* get to me would be worse than death. I was absolutely certain of this. At that moment, it was slowly flying towards me. My only option was to get away from it.

Through the demons.

**—BOOM—** Like a wave parting the sea, I shot a massive hole straight ahead down the street. The demons who weren't hit were thrown or tripped up as their friends exploded next to them.

I ran forwards and to the right, toward a backyard wall on the corner. My right arm was making it hard to run. I had to keep it pressed against me or I'd bleed out. My shirt was already soaked with blood.

**—BOOM—** Light and thunder erupted from the revolver as demons to my right stopped existing. Even though I shot with my left hand, the gun was so powerful that I only had to aim in their general direction.

The path ahead was now clear, but I was still being chased from behind. I needed to move, fast.

**—BOOM—** I shot through the wall in front of me, reducing it to rubble.

My hastily made plan was to shoot through the backyard wall, run around the house, and keep going from there.

However, I underestimated the black revolver. It shot through the wall *and* the house. And the house across the street. And the wall behind that. And the house behind that...

**—BOOM—** Windows shattered into a million pieces. **—BOOM—** Bricks turned to dust. **—BOOM—** Wood exploded into splinters.

I enlarged the hole so that I could run in a straight line through everything. I twisted as I ran—almost tripping—and fired behind me to slow down my pursuers. **—BOOM—** I didn't have time to see the results.

I ran. Through houses, backyards, and streets—I ran. My breath was getting heavier. Pain and blood loss were hitting me now. The whispers were still loud in my head. I was miserable, and I had to force my legs to keep moving. Only fear and my will to live kept me going.

I was shooting behind me to keep the demons off, trying to get a lead on them. I almost collapsed a wall and buried myself when I fired next to it, but my plan was otherwise working. I was going to escape.

I was running through another house when a skinless man hiding in a bedroom lunged at me.

My reaction time was impaired by blood loss and overexertion, so I couldn't dodge. He knocked me off my feet and his sharp talons raked across my face. I was so tired. My gun was wedged between us, so when I pulled the trigger **—BOOM—** he turned to paste.

I grit my teeth, painfully rose to my feet, and made it out of the house.

Demons were waiting. They were flooding the street and the houses in front of me.

They had cut me off. I was surrounded. I couldn't run any longer.

Panicking, I began firing wildly. **—BOOM—** A dozen demons died. **—BOOM—** I missed, and the front of a house exploded, raining bricks. **—BOOM—** A demon jumping at me from the side was blown apart by the muzzle blast. **—BOOM—** Another miss, this one hitting the sky. **—BOOM—** It directly impacted the cobblestone street, sending rocky shrapnel flying and shredding nearby demons. The hole it created went all the way down to bedrock.

I cleared an area in the middle of the street and staggered over to it.

I swung around like a madman, shooting, trying to keep the demons away. They were trickling in faster now, from all directions. I couldn't do this forever.

*I have to get out,* I thought, despairing. *I have to find a way out.*

**—BOOM—** Demons emerging from an alley were blown away, along with half of the alley itself.

*How did I even get here?* My thoughts were all over the place as dust and destruction filled my vision. *What did I do?*

There was a brief moment of respite as I thinned out the approaching horde.

*Was it just because I picked up the gun?* I was concentrating on this problem like my life depended on it—because it did. *Was it because I looked in the cylinder?*

Something appeared down the street. It was some kind of disturbingly-shaped person.

**—BOOM—**

It kept running.

*I must have missed,* I thought.

**—BOOM—** My finger was numb on the trigger. **—BOOM—** I steadied my aim. **—BOOM—**

I didn't miss.

It wasn't stopping, and it was getting larger. I could see it clearly now.

It wasn't the size of a normal man. It was a titan. As tall as a house, and half as wide. It looked incredibly muscular, but I suddenly realized why its shape was so odd.

It was made out of faces.

An abomination, comprised of nothing but human faces at different angles to each other. All of them with their eyes and mouths hideously open, as if they were trapped in an eternal scream of fear. Its fingers were human tongues, overlapping and quivering.

My bullets—or whatever the revolver was firing—only scratched it, drawing a pathetic amount of blood.

It was fast. Too fast to outrun.

The whispers were getting louder. The *thing* was also closing in.

I was shaking again and paralyzed in horror when I suddenly remembered something.

*I said 'what the hell',* I realized. *I got here after I said the word 'hell'.* I snapped out of my frozen state.

""TAKE ME BACK!"" I shouted, praying I could say something that would let me escape.

The army of demons had been gathering together behind the houses, and now they swarmed at me in a tidal wave of death.

**—BOOM—** ""TAKE ME—"" I frantically swung around in every direction, trying to kill the faster ones before they could reach me. **—BOOM—** —HOME!"" I screamed.

The many-faced nightmare was five houses away. I could see the *thing* in the air out of the corner of my eye; its whispers were becoming screams.

""TAKE—"" **—BOOM—** I was mowing demons down, my finger flickering on the trigger. **—BOOM—** By the tens. **—BOOM—** By the hundreds.

""—ME—"" **—BOOM—** I was surrounded by a crater formed by the revolver's apocalyptic power. **—BOOM—** Every shot shook the world. **—BOOM—** Blood fell like rain.

""—TO—"" **—BOOM—** Demons were closing in on all sides. **—BOOM—** The titan jumped for me, tongued fingers extended. **—BOOM—** A tendril melted into existence and whipped at my throat. **—BOOM—**

I cried out desperately, *""—EARTH!""*

Instantly, I was back in the desert. The stars shone down from the night sky overhead.

I fell to my knees, and my outstretched hand, white-knuckling the revolver, fell limp at my side. A sudden wave of exhaustion hit me. Combined with the exhaustion I had already been feeling, I was about to pass out.

Dismissing the revolver—I could do it as easily as breathing now—I crawled over to my pack, which was still on the ground next to the pile of ash.

I was too tired to be alarmed by the scorpion crawling over it. I flicked it off and rested my head on the backpack. My stump was—mercifully—no longer bleeding.

Drenched in demon blood, I lost consciousness.

When I woke the next morning, I pushed myself up.

With my right hand.

---

The hike back to the trailhead was easy. Too easy. In fact, I felt better the longer I walked. Something about the gun had improved my body and senses.

My legs didn't ache, I didn't sweat, and I didn't have to drink as much water. I could see and hear much farther than before, and in greater clarity. I felt like I could look at the Sun without going blind, but I didn't try.

Only after I drove back to my house—and washed off the filth covering me—could I finally relax. Never had I felt such relief at coming home. Everything I had been through could almost be written off as a horrifying nightmare. I restrained myself from summoning the black revolver.

My new hand is a constant reminder of the truth, however. It's stronger. Much stronger. As I sit here, I have to be careful with the keys on the keyboard. I shattered my coffee cup this morning by accident when I picked it up.

It's warm to the touch, and looks different too. It's less... skin-like. It has a weird texture that reminds me of scales. And it has a slightly red color. A subtle dark red that fades in a gradient as it approaches the skin tone of my wrist.

I don't know what's happening to me, but I know the revolver is responsible. After reflecting on my experiences, I know that I've been wrapped up in some kind of struggle for a ""throne."" Whose throne? I was sent to that place when I said ""hell,"" so I'm afraid I already know the answer.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do now. I thought I could simply put all of this behind me...

...but in the last thirty minutes, I've started to feel that unnatural sense of dread—of danger—from somewhere far away. That feeling is growing.

Whatever is causing it... is getting closer.",1,1767285161.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1q1888k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1q1888k/the_devils_revolver/,The Devil's Revolver,"On the fourth day of my six-day backpacking trip through the Mojave Desert, I saw a pile of ash off the beaten path.

Old campfire sites are a common sight on a multi-day hike, but something about this one caught my eye.

A reflective black rock was resting on top of the ash. It looked like a meteorite. Curious, I approached and picked it up. It was small enough to hold in one hand, and slightly warm to the touch.

Immediately, I realized it was a tablet. Not the new kind of tablet, obviously, but an ancient-looking stone tablet with writing on it.

The engraving was in a dark red—slightly lighter than the pitch-black stone it was engraved on—and almost seemed to glow in the scorching midday sun. It didn't seem to be in English, but, oddly, I could read its message easily. Somehow, its text became perfectly legible when I concentrated on the strange letters.

This was what I read:

---

-TYRANT UPON THY THRONE-

-SOVEREIGN OF NOTHING-

-MAY DEATH AND ASH-

-HERALD THY RETURN-

---

I looked down at the ominous stone tablet, uneasy. It creeped me out.

*Who left this here?* I wondered, unsettled. *What a bizarre find.*

I shrugged, put it in my pack, and was about to walk away when I saw something else.

Removing the tablet revealed something beneath. I brushed the ash off—without picking it up—to see what it was.

A gun.

I gazed down, incredulously, at a huge, black revolver. A veritable hand cannon that seemed to be made out of the same meteorite as the tablet. The grip was a cloudy gray and blended in with the ash. It looked unique— and *extremely* expensive.

Now this was an *incredible* find. Who would leave a collector's gun in the ashes of a campfire?

I wiped the sweat from my eyes, took a swig of water from my canteen, and dropped my backpack off to the side. This deserved my full attention.

Crouching down, I wrapped my right hand around the grip of the revolver and carefully pulled it from the ash.

It was heavy, but felt perfect in my hand. In fact, I felt better just by holding it. My fatigue from walking in the blistering heat started to fade away. I couldn't feel the soreness in my legs. My thoughts were clearer.

I wasn't a gun nut or anything, but my friends had taken me to a shooting range a few times, so I knew how to use one. I thumbed the cylinder release and flicked my wrist to swing it out.

There were six chambers in the revolver's cylinder, and none of them were loaded... but one chamber was dark. A strange shadow where a bullet would have been. I couldn't see my hand through the chamber when I waved it on the other side. *Weird,* I thought.

I swung the cylinder shut and held the mysterious revolver in my hand for another minute, just enjoying the feel of it. It really was a nice gun, and I was definitely taking it with me. Maybe I'd become a gun nut after all. I went to put it in my pack.

With my hand inside the backpack, I tried to let go of the revolver.

I couldn't let go.

*Huh?*

I tried shaking it out of my hand. It wouldn't come off.

Panicking, I took my right hand out of the pack and tried to pry the gun off with my left.

*Is it covered in glue?* I thought, increasingly concerned for the skin of my palm. *Why can't I let go?*

I sat down and struggled with it, gritting my teeth as I tried to free my hand.

*Come on,* I thought, muscles straining. *Get off. Get off! GET. OFF—*

The revolver disappeared.

My left arm was almost dislocated as the object I was pulling on stopped existing.

I blinked.

I raised my empty right hand.

I stared at it.

I slowly opened and closed it a few times.

Silence.

""What the hell—""

The sun disappeared and everything plunged into darkness.

""—is going on?"" I said to myself, before jumping to my feet in shock. Adrenaline flooded my body, overpowering a sudden wave of exhaustion that hit me at the same time.

The desert was gone; I stood on cobblestone. The sunlight was gone; it was pitch dark.

I was somewhere else.

I froze for a moment, dumbfounded, as my brain tried to process all of the impossible things happening to me.

My hands were shaking. I was hyperventilating.

*What...* I thought slowly, *...what just happened?*

I was freaking out.

*Where is the gun?*

*Where is my backpack?*

*Where did the desert go?*

The most important question occurred to me.

*Where am I?*

I whipped my head around in every direction.

*WHERE AM I?!* My heart was racing.

It looked like I was in the middle of a deserted city, on a cobblestone street lined with old, weathered brick houses. There were no sidewalks, telephone wires, light poles, or anything a modern city would have. It was like I had gone backwards through time.

There were no lights anywhere. No fires, no lanterns, no lit windows. It was a ghost town.

I looked up, and saw only darkness. No stars, no moon. Nothing. It was just pitch black, *everywhere*. I didn't know how I was even able to see, but I wasn't in the state of mind to dwell on that.

*Am I underground?* I thought, still panicking. *Why am I here? HOW?!*

I was overwhelmed. It was too much. What was I going to do?

I doubled over, hands on my knees, trying to control my breathing. I needed to calm down. I needed to figure this out. There was a rational explanation... somewhere. I had to find it.

After a minute, I had mostly recovered. I took my hands from my knees and straightened up.

My first thought was to look for help. I needed someone to tell me where I was. They could give me directions, and possibly an explanation for how I got here.

*""Hello?""* I called out tentatively, praying that this city wasn't truly abandoned. *""Is anyone there?""*

Dead silence.

An unnatural chill went down my spine.

Dread. I felt it growing from every direction. Like a thousand hands pressing down on me from all sides. An unnatural feeling, almost like a sixth sense. A sense of danger.

I needed to get out of this city. Now. Something was wrong here.

I started jogging towards an intersection I could see in the distance. There had to be more in this city than the houses surrounding me. Maybe I could find a way out by myself.

Passing by an alley, I caught a glimpse of something that may have been a large rat scurrying away. I didn't stop to look.

Once I reached the three-way intersection, I could see down the two streets that branched off to the sides.

More houses. I must have been in the suburbs of the city, and I had no idea which direction would get me out of them.

It was time to explore one of the houses. There might be a clue to where I was. Aside from that, I was curious to see if people had ever lived here.

Walking up to the brick house facing the intersection, I stopped in front of its plain wooden door.

Not expecting an answer, I knocked. It was better to be safe in case someone was actually in there.

To my surprise, someone answered.

*""Come in!""* a jovial man's voice called out from inside. *""Please, come in! I can't come to the door!""*

Slightly relieved to hear a friendly voice in this oppressive place, I opened the door and went in.

What I saw when I entered the foyer was refreshingly normal: a small coat rack, shoes on the floor, a mat to wipe your feet, and an umbrella resting next to the door. I could see the living room ahead of me. These houses weren't abandoned after all. I closed the front door.

""Please, make yourself comfortable!"" the boisterous voice exclaimed from a different room. ""You'll have to forgive me, I wasn't expecting guests! You caught me making dinner— please, just take a seat in the living room.""

His voice had an overwhelming charisma to it. I felt like this guy made friends as easily as he breathed. Someone who could make anyone laugh—who brightened a room just by their presence. I could almost hear his smile.

""Thank you!"" I called out as I stepped into the living room. ""I'm a bit lost, and could use some help.""

""Of course!"" he replied. I heard sounds of cutlery. ""Always happy to help someone in need. Just a moment!""

I took in the living room as I waited. I still felt uneasy, but what I saw calmed me down a bit.

There were two small couches facing each other in the center of the room. Glass coffee tables topped with ashtrays were in front of both. Lining the walls were bookcases and landscape paintings, and the wall facing the street had two windows.

It was a perfect room to relax and socialize with others, which fit the general impression I had of my host.

Behind me, I heard a noise.

I turned around—and recoiled in horror.

He was standing in a doorway, holding a butcher's cleaver.

It wasn't the cleaver that frightened me. It was his face. Or the lack of one. He had no eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, a vertical opening full of bristling, razor-sharp teeth split his face in two.

I jumped backwards and screamed, ""GET BACK!"" This was a nightmare. ""GET AWAY FROM ME!""

He took a step forward.

""Please, relax,"" he said in a comforting voice. His ""mouth"" quivered hideously as he spoke. ""Don't worry. I'm here to help you.""

My body was shaking from fear. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't think.

""STOP!"" I shouted frantically as I took another step back. I had to do something. I had to do something *now*.

I put my right hand behind my back. ""I'LL SHOOT YOU!"" I screamed, voice cracking. ""I HAVE A GUN!"" It was a bluff, but I wished it were true. I desperately needed the gun right now.

Suddenly, my right hand was weighed down, wrapping around a familiar grip.

Not questioning this miracle, I pulled the black revolver from behind my back and quickly leveled it at him.

""DON'T MOVE!"" I yelled. The gun wasn't loaded, but I prayed it was enough to scare him off.

He cocked his head to the side as he considered the large revolver trained on him. ""This is just a big misunderstanding,"" he said, reasonably. He shrugged and held out the cleaver. ""It's not what it looks like.""

He took another step forward.

I hesitated.

Faster than I could blink, he lunged at me.

With a merciless swing of his cleaver, he chopped off my right hand, sending it flying. The revolver disappeared.

*""AAAAHHHHHH!""* I cried out in shock and terror—the pain hadn't hit me yet—as I stumbled backwards, my hand replaced by a geyser of blood. I tripped on a coffee table and crashed through it, shattering the glass and landing on my back.

The monster wasn't wasting time—he immediately recovered from his brutal attack and jumped forward to finish me off.

His cleaver was raised high as he bore down on me. His vertical maw was fully opened, revealing dozens of viciously sharp teeth. He was eerily silent as he brought the cleaver down.

My death was imminent. My thoughts were frozen by fear. I screamed, watching the smooth arc of his cleaver as it approached my face. I uselessly put up my remaining hand to protect myself, even as I realized it was futile.

I acted by reflex.

The black revolver appeared in my left hand and I pulled the trigger.

**—BOOM—**

All of the furniture in the room exploded into a hail of splinters. The windows shattered. The floor cracked around me and the building shook. The air in the room became a gale as it fled in terror. It was so loud that my eardrums should have burst. It was so bright that my retinas should have fried. It was so powerful that the recoil should have ripped my arm off.

A path of annihilation about two feet wide began at the muzzle of the barrel and ended in the sky, which was now visible through the gaping hole in the ceiling. Everything in that path had turned to dust.

Half of the monster's body had simply disappeared. The rest became a spray of gore and bloody mist from the muzzle blast, splattering around the room. His cleaver—inches from my face—was thrown from his obliterated fingers, and its mangled remnants were embedded into one of the brick walls.

Shell-shocked, I lurched to my feet. I staggered to the front door before the dust could settle. The stump of my missing right hand was still bleeding—the pain creeping in—and I pressed it into my left armpit. My revolver hung heavy by my side as I gripped it tight.

I threw the front door open—and froze. My ragged breath caught. What I saw had stopped me cold.

Blood from my wound rolled down my good arm, my white-knuckled hand, the revolver, and dripped to the ground as I took it all in.

Demons. That was the only way I could describe them. They were completely surrounding the empty intersection in front of me.

A horde. An army. Filling the streets. Crowding shoulder-to-shoulder, as far as the eye could see. Demons.

Most were the split-faced monstrosities like the one I had just killed, but I could see other kinds scattered among them.

I saw dozens of skinless people, slick with blood and frightening with their rictus grins. Exposed muscles visibly coiled and uncoiled with every movement. They twitched erratically and their lidless stares were hungry.

Some jumbled masses of writhing tentacles the size of dogs were floating a few feet off the ground. They bobbed up and down in a bizarre rhythm, and I couldn't tell how deadly they were.

Two or three tall, thin humanoids resembling stick figures towered over the demons near them. Their spindly, long arms narrowed down to evil points that could easily spear through a chest. Where a face should have been was an empty cavity that exposed their hollow heads.

I saw at least one gigantic spider, larger than a bear, with no eyes. It was pale, hairy, and had huge, arm-length fangs. Disgusting holes covered its entire body, and countless ""baby"" spiders—the size of tarantulas—were crawling in and out of them.

There were more, but my concentration was broken.

Whispers.

I didn't hear them with my ears. The whispers were in my head. An insidious susurration of seemingly thousands of people. None of it made sense—it was maddening. It was impossible to ignore. I could tell, somehow, that they were coming from behind me, on the other side of the house.

At that same moment, the dread I was feeling from every direction suddenly spiked from the place the whispers originated. I knew instinctively that it was far more dangerous than every demon in front of me combined. The whispers were getting louder.

I ran away from it to the only place I could: the empty intersection. None of the demons made a move on me.

When I looked behind me and over the house—

I saw it. It was flying. It was gigantic.

And it was the single most terrifying thing I had ever seen in my entire life. My heart thundered in my ears.

I didn't even think. I raised the revolver and fired three times.

**—BOOM—** An explosion of light broke the darkness. Cobblestone on the ground shook loose in front of me. Dust went flying across the street.

**—BOOM—** Pieces of cobblestone were thrown so forcefully by the muzzle blast that they became projectiles; windows shattered and demons raised arms to defend themselves.

**—BOOM—** A maelstrom surrounded me as the air desperately kept trying to return, only to be blown away once again. Dirt under the stripped cobblestone was kicked up into the air.

Silence. The whispers stopped. Dust swirled, obscuring my vision.

*I killed it,* I thought, praying. *Please let it be dead.*

The dust settled.

It was completely unharmed.

The *thing* flying in the air defied description. It was an abomination. Even the smallest attempt to understand its form would impart a lifetime of crippling nightmares. It was anathema to the human mind.

If I had to define it in that moment, I would say that it was vaguely humanoid in shape. It had an uncountable number of tendrils surrounding it that seemed to phase in and out of existence in a meaningless pattern. I couldn't describe what color the tendrils were or what they were made of, because I had never seen any color or material like it before. It was alien.

None of that was noteworthy compared to the center of its body.

There, I saw the Abyss.

A maw of Hell.

It wasn't black. It was Nothing. An unfathomable absence. It was the opposite of looking at the Sun. It didn't overwhelm the eyes. It took from them. It stole something from the mind. In that moment, I knew that the gun was protecting me somehow. I knew that if a normal person had looked directly into that void, they would have instantly gone insane. A slave to unspeakable madness— forever.

The silence was broken.

***FRAGMENT BEARER***

I screamed. A sickening spike of pure agony was being driven behind my eyes. The *thing*'s whispers had combined into an infernal roar.

***ASPIRANT TO THE ASHEN THRONE***

I felt like my skull was going to shatter. It was a cacophony of the damned; a million raging souls, piercing my mind.

***WE REJECT THY CLAIM***

""WAIT!"" I managed to cry out, pushing through the pain. This *thing* seemed to be intelligent, and I was desperate. ""YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG—""

***PERISH***

I was in the center of a three-way intersection, at the top of the ""T"", with one street ahead of me and the others on my left and right.

All three streets were choked with demons.

Every single one of them came for me at the same time.

I was too numb from everything happening to freeze in terror. I felt it—as I watched hundreds, maybe even thousands of demons charging, I felt it—but in that split second, all that mattered was survival.

I wasn't going to double back into the house. Letting that *thing* get to me would be worse than death. I was absolutely certain of this. At that moment, it was slowly flying towards me. My only option was to get away from it.

Through the demons.

**—BOOM—** Like a wave parting the sea, I shot a massive hole straight ahead down the street. The demons who weren't hit were thrown or tripped up as their friends exploded next to them.

I ran forwards and to the right, toward a backyard wall on the corner. My right arm was making it hard to run. I had to keep it pressed against me or I'd bleed out. My shirt was already soaked with blood.

**—BOOM—** Light and thunder erupted from the revolver as demons to my right stopped existing. Even though I shot with my left hand, the gun was so powerful that I only had to aim in their general direction.

The path ahead was now clear, but I was still being chased from behind. I needed to move, fast.

**—BOOM—** I shot through the wall in front of me, reducing it to rubble.

My hastily made plan was to shoot through the backyard wall, run around the house, and keep going from there.

However, I underestimated the black revolver. It shot through the wall *and* the house. And the house across the street. And the wall behind that. And the house behind that...

**—BOOM—** Windows shattered into a million pieces. **—BOOM—** Bricks turned to dust. **—BOOM—** Wood exploded into splinters.

I enlarged the hole so that I could run in a straight line through everything. I twisted as I ran—almost tripping—and fired behind me to slow down my pursuers. **—BOOM—** I didn't have time to see the results.

I ran. Through houses, backyards, and streets—I ran. My breath was getting heavier. Pain and blood loss were hitting me now. The whispers were still loud in my head. I was miserable, and I had to force my legs to keep moving. Only fear and my will to live kept me going.

I was shooting behind me to keep the demons off, trying to get a lead on them. I almost collapsed a wall and buried myself when I fired next to it, but my plan was otherwise working. I was going to escape.

I was running through another house when a skinless man hiding in a bedroom lunged at me.

My reaction time was impaired by blood loss and overexertion, so I couldn't dodge. He knocked me off my feet and his sharp talons raked across my face. I was so tired. My gun was wedged between us, so when I pulled the trigger **—BOOM—** he turned to paste.

I grit my teeth, painfully rose to my feet, and made it out of the house.

Demons were waiting. They were flooding the street and the houses in front of me.

They had cut me off. I was surrounded. I couldn't run any longer.

Panicking, I began firing wildly. **—BOOM—** A dozen demons died. **—BOOM—** I missed, and the front of a house exploded, raining bricks. **—BOOM—** A demon jumping at me from the side was blown apart by the muzzle blast. **—BOOM—** Another miss, this one hitting the sky. **—BOOM—** It directly impacted the cobblestone street, sending rocky shrapnel flying and shredding nearby demons. The hole it created went all the way down to bedrock.

I cleared an area in the middle of the street and staggered over to it.

I swung around like a madman, shooting, trying to keep the demons away. They were trickling in faster now, from all directions. I couldn't do this forever.

*I have to get out,* I thought, despairing. *I have to find a way out.*

**—BOOM—** Demons emerging from an alley were blown away, along with half of the alley itself.

*How did I even get here?* My thoughts were all over the place as dust and destruction filled my vision. *What did I do?*

There was a brief moment of respite as I thinned out the approaching horde.

*Was it just because I picked up the gun?* I was concentrating on this problem like my life depended on it—because it did. *Was it because I looked in the cylinder?*

Something appeared down the street. It was some kind of disturbingly-shaped person.

**—BOOM—**

It kept running.

*I must have missed,* I thought.

**—BOOM—** My finger was numb on the trigger. **—BOOM—** I steadied my aim. **—BOOM—**

I didn't miss.

It wasn't stopping, and it was getting larger. I could see it clearly now.

It wasn't the size of a normal man. It was a titan. As tall as a house, and half as wide. It looked incredibly muscular, but I suddenly realized why its shape was so odd.

It was made out of faces.

An abomination, comprised of nothing but human faces at different angles to each other. All of them with their eyes and mouths hideously open, as if they were trapped in an eternal scream of fear. Its fingers were human tongues, overlapping and quivering.

My bullets—or whatever the revolver was firing—only scratched it, drawing a pathetic amount of blood.

It was fast. Too fast to outrun.

The whispers were getting louder. The *thing* was also closing in.

I was shaking again and paralyzed in horror when I suddenly remembered something.

*I said 'what the hell',* I realized. *I got here after I said the word 'hell'.* I snapped out of my frozen state.

""TAKE ME BACK!"" I shouted, praying I could say something that would let me escape.

The army of demons had been gathering together behind the houses, and now they swarmed at me in a tidal wave of death.

**—BOOM—** ""TAKE ME—"" I frantically swung around in every direction, trying to kill the faster ones before they could reach me. **—BOOM—** —HOME!"" I screamed.

The many-faced nightmare was five houses away. I could see the *thing* in the air out of the corner of my eye; its whispers were becoming screams.

""TAKE—"" **—BOOM—** I was mowing demons down, my finger flickering on the trigger. **—BOOM—** By the tens. **—BOOM—** By the hundreds.

""—ME—"" **—BOOM—** I was surrounded by a crater formed by the revolver's apocalyptic power. **—BOOM—** Every shot shook the world. **—BOOM—** Blood fell like rain.

""—TO—"" **—BOOM—** Demons were closing in on all sides. **—BOOM—** The titan jumped for me, tongued fingers extended. **—BOOM—** A tendril melted into existence and whipped at my throat. **—BOOM—**

I cried out desperately, *""—EARTH!""*

Instantly, I was back in the desert. The stars shone down from the night sky overhead.

I fell to my knees, and my outstretched hand, white-knuckling the revolver, fell limp at my side. A sudden wave of exhaustion hit me. Combined with the exhaustion I had already been feeling, I was about to pass out.

Dismissing the revolver—I could do it as easily as breathing now—I crawled over to my pack, which was still on the ground next to the pile of ash.

I was too tired to be alarmed by the scorpion crawling over it. I flicked it off and rested my head on the backpack. My stump was—mercifully—no longer bleeding.

Drenched in demon blood, I lost consciousness.

When I woke the next morning, I pushed myself up.

With my right hand.

---

The hike back to the trailhead was easy. Too easy. In fact, I felt better the longer I walked. Something about the gun had improved my body and senses.

My legs didn't ache, I didn't sweat, and I didn't have to drink as much water. I could see and hear much farther than before, and in greater clarity. I felt like I could look at the Sun without going blind, but I didn't try.

Only after I drove back to my house—and washed off the filth covering me—could I finally relax. Never had I felt such relief at coming home. Everything I had been through could almost be written off as a horrifying nightmare. I restrained myself from summoning the black revolver.

My new hand is a constant reminder of the truth, however. It's stronger. Much stronger. As I sit here, I have to be careful with the keys on the keyboard. I shattered my coffee cup this morning by accident when I picked it up.

It's warm to the touch, and looks different too. It's less... skin-like. It has a weird texture that reminds me of scales. And it has a slightly red color. A subtle dark red that fades in a gradient as it approaches the skin tone of my wrist.

I don't know what's happening to me, but I know the revolver is responsible. After reflecting on my experiences, I know that I've been wrapped up in some kind of struggle for a ""throne."" Whose throne? I was sent to that place when I said ""hell,"" so I'm afraid I already know the answer.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do now. I thought I could simply put all of this behind me...

...but in the last thirty minutes, I've started to feel that unnatural sense of dread—of danger—from somewhere far away. That feeling is growing.

Whatever is causing it... is getting closer.",5,1767285124.0,Odd_directions,1,0.86,False

1q187l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q187l6/the_devils_revolver/,The Devil's Revolver,"On the fourth day of my six-day backpacking trip through the Mojave Desert, I saw a pile of ash off the beaten path.

Old campfire sites are a common sight on a multi-day hike, but something about this one caught my eye.

A reflective black rock was resting on top of the ash. It looked like a meteorite. Curious, I approached and picked it up. It was small enough to hold in one hand, and slightly warm to the touch.

Immediately, I realized it was a tablet. Not the new kind of tablet, obviously, but an ancient-looking stone tablet with writing on it.

The engraving was in a dark red—slightly lighter than the pitch-black stone it was engraved on—and almost seemed to glow in the scorching midday sun. It didn't seem to be in English, but, oddly, I could read its message easily. Somehow, its text became perfectly legible when I concentrated on the strange letters.

This was what I read:

---

-TYRANT UPON THY THRONE-

-SOVEREIGN OF NOTHING-

-MAY DEATH AND ASH-

-HERALD THY RETURN-

---

I looked down at the ominous stone tablet, uneasy. It creeped me out.

*Who left this here?* I wondered, unsettled. *What a bizarre find.*

I shrugged, put it in my pack, and was about to walk away when I saw something else.

Removing the tablet revealed something beneath. I brushed the ash off—without picking it up—to see what it was.

A gun.

I gazed down, incredulously, at a huge, black revolver. A veritable hand cannon that seemed to be made out of the same meteorite as the tablet. The grip was a cloudy gray and blended in with the ash. It looked unique— and *extremely* expensive.

Now this was an *incredible* find. Who would leave a collector's gun in the ashes of a campfire?

I wiped the sweat from my eyes, took a swig of water from my canteen, and dropped my backpack off to the side. This deserved my full attention.

Crouching down, I wrapped my right hand around the grip of the revolver and carefully pulled it from the ash.

It was heavy, but felt perfect in my hand. In fact, I felt better just by holding it. My fatigue from walking in the blistering heat started to fade away. I couldn't feel the soreness in my legs. My thoughts were clearer.

I wasn't a gun nut or anything, but my friends had taken me to a shooting range a few times, so I knew how to use one. I thumbed the cylinder release and flicked my wrist to swing it out.

There were six chambers in the revolver's cylinder, and none of them were loaded... but one chamber was dark. A strange shadow where a bullet would have been. I couldn't see my hand through the chamber when I waved it on the other side. *Weird,* I thought.

I swung the cylinder shut and held the mysterious revolver in my hand for another minute, just enjoying the feel of it. It really was a nice gun, and I was definitely taking it with me. Maybe I'd become a gun nut after all. I went to put it in my pack.

With my hand inside the backpack, I tried to let go of the revolver.

I couldn't let go.

*Huh?*

I tried shaking it out of my hand. It wouldn't come off.

Panicking, I took my right hand out of the pack and tried to pry the gun off with my left.

*Is it covered in glue?* I thought, increasingly concerned for the skin of my palm. *Why can't I let go?*

I sat down and struggled with it, gritting my teeth as I tried to free my hand.

*Come on,* I thought, muscles straining. *Get off. Get off! GET. OFF—*

The revolver disappeared.

My left arm was almost dislocated as the object I was pulling on stopped existing.

I blinked.

I raised my empty right hand.

I stared at it.

I slowly opened and closed it a few times.

Silence.

""What the hell—""

The sun disappeared and everything plunged into darkness.

""—is going on?"" I said to myself, before jumping to my feet in shock. Adrenaline flooded my body, overpowering a sudden wave of exhaustion that hit me at the same time.

The desert was gone; I stood on cobblestone. The sunlight was gone; it was pitch dark.

I was somewhere else.

I froze for a moment, dumbfounded, as my brain tried to process all of the impossible things happening to me.

My hands were shaking. I was hyperventilating.

*What...* I thought slowly, *...what just happened?*

I was freaking out.

*Where is the gun?*

*Where is my backpack?*

*Where did the desert go?*

The most important question occurred to me.

*Where am I?*

I whipped my head around in every direction.

*WHERE AM I?!* My heart was racing.

It looked like I was in the middle of a deserted city, on a cobblestone street lined with old, weathered brick houses. There were no sidewalks, telephone wires, light poles, or anything a modern city would have. It was like I had gone backwards through time.

There were no lights anywhere. No fires, no lanterns, no lit windows. It was a ghost town.

I looked up, and saw only darkness. No stars, no moon. Nothing. It was just pitch black, *everywhere*. I didn't know how I was even able to see, but I wasn't in the state of mind to dwell on that.

*Am I underground?* I thought, still panicking. *Why am I here? HOW?!*

I was overwhelmed. It was too much. What was I going to do?

I doubled over, hands on my knees, trying to control my breathing. I needed to calm down. I needed to figure this out. There was a rational explanation... somewhere. I had to find it.

After a minute, I had mostly recovered. I took my hands from my knees and straightened up.

My first thought was to look for help. I needed someone to tell me where I was. They could give me directions, and possibly an explanation for how I got here.

*""Hello?""* I called out tentatively, praying that this city wasn't truly abandoned. *""Is anyone there?""*

Dead silence.

An unnatural chill went down my spine.

Dread. I felt it growing from every direction. Like a thousand hands pressing down on me from all sides. An unnatural feeling, almost like a sixth sense. A sense of danger.

I needed to get out of this city. Now. Something was wrong here.

I started jogging towards an intersection I could see in the distance. There had to be more in this city than the houses surrounding me. Maybe I could find a way out by myself.

Passing by an alley, I caught a glimpse of something that may have been a large rat scurrying away. I didn't stop to look.

Once I reached the three-way intersection, I could see down the two streets that branched off to the sides.

More houses. I must have been in the suburbs of the city, and I had no idea which direction would get me out of them.

It was time to explore one of the houses. There might be a clue to where I was. Aside from that, I was curious to see if people had ever lived here.

Walking up to the brick house facing the intersection, I stopped in front of its plain wooden door.

Not expecting an answer, I knocked. It was better to be safe in case someone was actually in there.

To my surprise, someone answered.

*""Come in!""* a jovial man's voice called out from inside. *""Please, come in! I can't come to the door!""*

Slightly relieved to hear a friendly voice in this oppressive place, I opened the door and went in.

What I saw when I entered the foyer was refreshingly normal: a small coat rack, shoes on the floor, a mat to wipe your feet, and an umbrella resting next to the door. I could see the living room ahead of me. These houses weren't abandoned after all. I closed the front door.

""Please, make yourself comfortable!"" the boisterous voice exclaimed from a different room. ""You'll have to forgive me, I wasn't expecting guests! You caught me making dinner— please, just take a seat in the living room.""

His voice had an overwhelming charisma to it. I felt like this guy made friends as easily as he breathed. Someone who could make anyone laugh—who brightened a room just by their presence. I could almost hear his smile.

""Thank you!"" I called out as I stepped into the living room. ""I'm a bit lost, and could use some help.""

""Of course!"" he replied. I heard sounds of cutlery. ""Always happy to help someone in need. Just a moment!""

I took in the living room as I waited. I still felt uneasy, but what I saw calmed me down a bit.

There were two small couches facing each other in the center of the room. Glass coffee tables topped with ashtrays were in front of both. Lining the walls were bookcases and landscape paintings, and the wall facing the street had two windows.

It was a perfect room to relax and socialize with others, which fit the general impression I had of my host.

Behind me, I heard a noise.

I turned around—and recoiled in horror.

He was standing in a doorway, holding a butcher's cleaver.

It wasn't the cleaver that frightened me. It was his face. Or the lack of one. He had no eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, a vertical opening full of bristling, razor-sharp teeth split his face in two.

I jumped backwards and screamed, ""GET BACK!"" This was a nightmare. ""GET AWAY FROM ME!""

He took a step forward.

""Please, relax,"" he said in a comforting voice. His ""mouth"" quivered hideously as he spoke. ""Don't worry. I'm here to help you.""

My body was shaking from fear. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't think.

""STOP!"" I shouted frantically as I took another step back. I had to do something. I had to do something *now*.

I put my right hand behind my back. ""I'LL SHOOT YOU!"" I screamed, voice cracking. ""I HAVE A GUN!"" It was a bluff, but I wished it were true. I desperately needed the gun right now.

Suddenly, my right hand was weighed down, wrapping around a familiar grip.

Not questioning this miracle, I pulled the black revolver from behind my back and quickly leveled it at him.

""DON'T MOVE!"" I yelled. The gun wasn't loaded, but I prayed it was enough to scare him off.

He cocked his head to the side as he considered the large revolver trained on him. ""This is just a big misunderstanding,"" he said, reasonably. He shrugged and held out the cleaver. ""It's not what it looks like.""

He took another step forward.

I hesitated.

Faster than I could blink, he lunged at me.

With a merciless swing of his cleaver, he chopped off my right hand, sending it flying. The revolver disappeared.

*""AAAAHHHHHH!""* I cried out in shock and terror—the pain hadn't hit me yet—as I stumbled backwards, my hand replaced by a geyser of blood. I tripped on a coffee table and crashed through it, shattering the glass and landing on my back.

The monster wasn't wasting time—he immediately recovered from his brutal attack and jumped forward to finish me off.

His cleaver was raised high as he bore down on me. His vertical maw was fully opened, revealing dozens of viciously sharp teeth. He was eerily silent as he brought the cleaver down.

My death was imminent. My thoughts were frozen by fear. I screamed, watching the smooth arc of his cleaver as it approached my face. I uselessly put up my remaining hand to protect myself, even as I realized it was futile.

I acted by reflex.

The black revolver appeared in my left hand and I pulled the trigger.

**—BOOM—**

All of the furniture in the room exploded into a hail of splinters. The windows shattered. The floor cracked around me and the building shook. The air in the room became a gale as it fled in terror. It was so loud that my eardrums should have burst. It was so bright that my retinas should have fried. It was so powerful that the recoil should have ripped my arm off.

A path of annihilation about two feet wide began at the muzzle of the barrel and ended in the sky, which was now visible through the gaping hole in the ceiling. Everything in that path had turned to dust.

Half of the monster's body had simply disappeared. The rest became a spray of gore and bloody mist from the muzzle blast, splattering around the room. His cleaver—inches from my face—was thrown from his obliterated fingers, and its mangled remnants were embedded into one of the brick walls.

Shell-shocked, I lurched to my feet. I staggered to the front door before the dust could settle. The stump of my missing right hand was still bleeding—the pain creeping in—and I pressed it into my left armpit. My revolver hung heavy by my side as I gripped it tight.

I threw the front door open—and froze. My ragged breath caught. What I saw had stopped me cold.

Blood from my wound rolled down my good arm, my white-knuckled hand, the revolver, and dripped to the ground as I took it all in.

Demons. That was the only way I could describe them. They were completely surrounding the empty intersection in front of me.

A horde. An army. Filling the streets. Crowding shoulder-to-shoulder, as far as the eye could see. Demons.

Most were the split-faced monstrosities like the one I had just killed, but I could see other kinds scattered among them.

I saw dozens of skinless people, slick with blood and frightening with their rictus grins. Exposed muscles visibly coiled and uncoiled with every movement. They twitched erratically and their lidless stares were hungry.

Some jumbled masses of writhing tentacles the size of dogs were floating a few feet off the ground. They bobbed up and down in a bizarre rhythm, and I couldn't tell how deadly they were.

Two or three tall, thin humanoids resembling stick figures towered over the demons near them. Their spindly, long arms narrowed down to evil points that could easily spear through a chest. Where a face should have been was an empty cavity that exposed their hollow heads.

I saw at least one gigantic spider, larger than a bear, with no eyes. It was pale, hairy, and had huge, arm-length fangs. Disgusting holes covered its entire body, and countless ""baby"" spiders—the size of tarantulas—were crawling in and out of them.

There were more, but my concentration was broken.

Whispers.

I didn't hear them with my ears. The whispers were in my head. An insidious susurration of seemingly thousands of people. None of it made sense—it was maddening. It was impossible to ignore. I could tell, somehow, that they were coming from behind me, on the other side of the house.

At that same moment, the dread I was feeling from every direction suddenly spiked from the place the whispers originated. I knew instinctively that it was far more dangerous than every demon in front of me combined. The whispers were getting louder.

I ran away from it to the only place I could: the empty intersection. None of the demons made a move on me.

When I looked behind me and over the house—

I saw it. It was flying. It was gigantic.

And it was the single most terrifying thing I had ever seen in my entire life. My heart thundered in my ears.

I didn't even think. I raised the revolver and fired three times.

**—BOOM—** An explosion of light broke the darkness. Cobblestone on the ground shook loose in front of me. Dust went flying across the street.

**—BOOM—** Pieces of cobblestone were thrown so forcefully by the muzzle blast that they became projectiles; windows shattered and demons raised arms to defend themselves.

**—BOOM—** A maelstrom surrounded me as the air desperately kept trying to return, only to be blown away once again. Dirt under the stripped cobblestone was kicked up into the air.

Silence. The whispers stopped. Dust swirled, obscuring my vision.

*I killed it,* I thought, praying. *Please let it be dead.*

The dust settled.

It was completely unharmed.

The *thing* flying in the air defied description. It was an abomination. Even the smallest attempt to understand its form would impart a lifetime of crippling nightmares. It was anathema to the human mind.

If I had to define it in that moment, I would say that it was vaguely humanoid in shape. It had an uncountable number of tendrils surrounding it that seemed to phase in and out of existence in a meaningless pattern. I couldn't describe what color the tendrils were or what they were made of, because I had never seen any color or material like it before. It was alien.

None of that was noteworthy compared to the center of its body.

There, I saw the Abyss.

A maw of Hell.

It wasn't black. It was Nothing. An unfathomable absence. It was the opposite of looking at the Sun. It didn't overwhelm the eyes. It took from them. It stole something from the mind. In that moment, I knew that the gun was protecting me somehow. I knew that if a normal person had looked directly into that void, they would have instantly gone insane. A slave to unspeakable madness— forever.

The silence was broken.

***FRAGMENT BEARER***

I screamed. A sickening spike of pure agony was being driven behind my eyes. The *thing*'s whispers had combined into an infernal roar.

***ASPIRANT TO THE ASHEN THRONE***

I felt like my skull was going to shatter. It was a cacophony of the damned; a million raging souls, piercing my mind.

***WE REJECT THY CLAIM***

""WAIT!"" I managed to cry out, pushing through the pain. This *thing* seemed to be intelligent, and I was desperate. ""YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG—""

***PERISH***

I was in the center of a three-way intersection, at the top of the ""T"", with one street ahead of me and the others on my left and right.

All three streets were choked with demons.

Every single one of them came for me at the same time.

I was too numb from everything happening to freeze in terror. I felt it—as I watched hundreds, maybe even thousands of demons charging, I felt it—but in that split second, all that mattered was survival.

I wasn't going to double back into the house. Letting that *thing* get to me would be worse than death. I was absolutely certain of this. At that moment, it was slowly flying towards me. My only option was to get away from it.

Through the demons.

**—BOOM—** Like a wave parting the sea, I shot a massive hole straight ahead down the street. The demons who weren't hit were thrown or tripped up as their friends exploded next to them.

I ran forwards and to the right, toward a backyard wall on the corner. My right arm was making it hard to run. I had to keep it pressed against me or I'd bleed out. My shirt was already soaked with blood.

**—BOOM—** Light and thunder erupted from the revolver as demons to my right stopped existing. Even though I shot with my left hand, the gun was so powerful that I only had to aim in their general direction.

The path ahead was now clear, but I was still being chased from behind. I needed to move, fast.

**—BOOM—** I shot through the wall in front of me, reducing it to rubble.

My hastily made plan was to shoot through the backyard wall, run around the house, and keep going from there.

However, I underestimated the black revolver. It shot through the wall *and* the house. And the house across the street. And the wall behind that. And the house behind that...

**—BOOM—** Windows shattered into a million pieces. **—BOOM—** Bricks turned to dust. **—BOOM—** Wood exploded into splinters.

I enlarged the hole so that I could run in a straight line through everything. I twisted as I ran—almost tripping—and fired behind me to slow down my pursuers. **—BOOM—** I didn't have time to see the results.

I ran. Through houses, backyards, and streets—I ran. My breath was getting heavier. Pain and blood loss were hitting me now. The whispers were still loud in my head. I was miserable, and I had to force my legs to keep moving. Only fear and my will to live kept me going.

I was shooting behind me to keep the demons off, trying to get a lead on them. I almost collapsed a wall and buried myself when I fired next to it, but my plan was otherwise working. I was going to escape.

I was running through another house when a skinless man hiding in a bedroom lunged at me.

My reaction time was impaired by blood loss and overexertion, so I couldn't dodge. He knocked me off my feet and his sharp talons raked across my face. I was so tired. My gun was wedged between us, so when I pulled the trigger **—BOOM—** he turned to paste.

I grit my teeth, painfully rose to my feet, and made it out of the house.

Demons were waiting. They were flooding the street and the houses in front of me.

They had cut me off. I was surrounded. I couldn't run any longer.

Panicking, I began firing wildly. **—BOOM—** A dozen demons died. **—BOOM—** I missed, and the front of a house exploded, raining bricks. **—BOOM—** A demon jumping at me from the side was blown apart by the muzzle blast. **—BOOM—** Another miss, this one hitting the sky. **—BOOM—** It directly impacted the cobblestone street, sending rocky shrapnel flying and shredding nearby demons. The hole it created went all the way down to bedrock.

I cleared an area in the middle of the street and staggered over to it.

I swung around like a madman, shooting, trying to keep the demons away. They were trickling in faster now, from all directions. I couldn't do this forever.

*I have to get out,* I thought, despairing. *I have to find a way out.*

**—BOOM—** Demons emerging from an alley were blown away, along with half of the alley itself.

*How did I even get here?* My thoughts were all over the place as dust and destruction filled my vision. *What did I do?*

There was a brief moment of respite as I thinned out the approaching horde.

*Was it just because I picked up the gun?* I was concentrating on this problem like my life depended on it—because it did. *Was it because I looked in the cylinder?*

Something appeared down the street. It was some kind of disturbingly-shaped person.

**—BOOM—**

It kept running.

*I must have missed,* I thought.

**—BOOM—** My finger was numb on the trigger. **—BOOM—** I steadied my aim. **—BOOM—**

I didn't miss.

It wasn't stopping, and it was getting larger. I could see it clearly now.

It wasn't the size of a normal man. It was a titan. As tall as a house, and half as wide. It looked incredibly muscular, but I suddenly realized why its shape was so odd.

It was made out of faces.

An abomination, comprised of nothing but human faces at different angles to each other. All of them with their eyes and mouths hideously open, as if they were trapped in an eternal scream of fear. Its fingers were human tongues, overlapping and quivering.

My bullets—or whatever the revolver was firing—only scratched it, drawing a pathetic amount of blood.

It was fast. Too fast to outrun.

The whispers were getting louder. The *thing* was also closing in.

I was shaking again and paralyzed in horror when I suddenly remembered something.

*I said 'what the hell',* I realized. *I got here after I said the word 'hell'.* I snapped out of my frozen state.

""TAKE ME BACK!"" I shouted, praying I could say something that would let me escape.

The army of demons had been gathering together behind the houses, and now they swarmed at me in a tidal wave of death.

**—BOOM—** ""TAKE ME—"" I frantically swung around in every direction, trying to kill the faster ones before they could reach me. **—BOOM—** —HOME!"" I screamed.

The many-faced nightmare was five houses away. I could see the *thing* in the air out of the corner of my eye; its whispers were becoming screams.

""TAKE—"" **—BOOM—** I was mowing demons down, my finger flickering on the trigger. **—BOOM—** By the tens. **—BOOM—** By the hundreds.

""—ME—"" **—BOOM—** I was surrounded by a crater formed by the revolver's apocalyptic power. **—BOOM—** Every shot shook the world. **—BOOM—** Blood fell like rain.

""—TO—"" **—BOOM—** Demons were closing in on all sides. **—BOOM—** The titan jumped for me, tongued fingers extended. **—BOOM—** A tendril melted into existence and whipped at my throat. **—BOOM—**

I cried out desperately, *""—EARTH!""*

Instantly, I was back in the desert. The stars shone down from the night sky overhead.

I fell to my knees, and my outstretched hand, white-knuckling the revolver, fell limp at my side. A sudden wave of exhaustion hit me. Combined with the exhaustion I had already been feeling, I was about to pass out.

Dismissing the revolver—I could do it as easily as breathing now—I crawled over to my pack, which was still on the ground next to the pile of ash.

I was too tired to be alarmed by the scorpion crawling over it. I flicked it off and rested my head on the backpack. My stump was—mercifully—no longer bleeding.

Drenched in demon blood, I lost consciousness.

When I woke the next morning, I pushed myself up.

With my right hand.

---

The hike back to the trailhead was easy. Too easy. In fact, I felt better the longer I walked. Something about the gun had improved my body and senses.

My legs didn't ache, I didn't sweat, and I didn't have to drink as much water. I could see and hear much farther than before, and in greater clarity. I felt like I could look at the Sun without going blind, but I didn't try.

Only after I drove back to my house—and washed off the filth covering me—could I finally relax. Never had I felt such relief at coming home. Everything I had been through could almost be written off as a horrifying nightmare. I restrained myself from summoning the black revolver.

My new hand is a constant reminder of the truth, however. It's stronger. Much stronger. As I sit here, I have to be careful with the keys on the keyboard. I shattered my coffee cup this morning by accident when I picked it up.

It's warm to the touch, and looks different too. It's less... skin-like. It has a weird texture that reminds me of scales. And it has a slightly red color. A subtle dark red that fades in a gradient as it approaches the skin tone of my wrist.

I don't know what's happening to me, but I know the revolver is responsible. After reflecting on my experiences, I know that I've been wrapped up in some kind of struggle for a ""throne."" Whose throne? I was sent to that place when I said ""hell,"" so I'm afraid I already know the answer.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do now. I thought I could simply put all of this behind me...

...but in the last thirty minutes, I've started to feel that unnatural sense of dread—of danger—from somewhere far away. That feeling is growing.

(Almost cried, NGL)","Okay Reddit, I gotta share my story about finally making that jump and starting my own thing. For ages, I'd been obsessed with cool, quirky t-shirt designs – you know, the ones that spark a conversation. I'd doodle them in notebooks, on napkins, basically everywhere. One day, fueled by too much coffee and a desperate need for a change from my soul-crushing retail job, I decided to actually *do* something about it.

The early days were pure chaos. My tiny apartment became a design studio, a printing station, and a shipping hub all at once. The smell of fresh ink and burnt toast (my staple diet) was constant. I spent countless nights glued to YouTube tutorials, trying to figure out Shopify, Photoshop, and how to even *source* decent blank tees. Every penny I'd saved went into a heat press, some vinyl, and launching the most basic website you can imagine. My friends thought I was nuts, working 14-hour days just to break even.

Weeks turned into a month, then two. The website was up, designs were looking sharp (to me, anyway!), but... nothing. Crickets. It was brutal. I'd refresh the sales page every five minutes, my stomach doing flip-flops with each empty refresh. Self-doubt started creeping in like a cold fog. 'What if this is just a stupid dream? What if I'm just wasting my time and money?' The fear of failure was a physical ache in my chest.

Then, one Tuesday night, around 2 AM, I was about to shut down my laptop, feeling utterly defeated. My phone, which had been silent for what felt like an eternity, *pinged*. Not a text, not an email notification... it was the Shopify app. 'New Order!' My heart practically leaped out of my chest. I stared at it, wide-eyed, re-reading it to make sure it wasn't a glitch. It was real! A single t-shirt, ordered by someone I didn't even know, all the way across the country.

I swear, I almost cried right there. It wasn't about the money; it was the validation. That one tiny sale, that one person who liked my design enough to spend their hard-earned cash, meant everything. It was the spark that lit the whole damn fire. Packing that first order, feeling the fabric, taping up the box – it felt like I was sending a piece of my soul out into the world. Pure, unadulterated joy, mixed with a healthy dose of 'Oh my god, I actually did it!'

Fast forward a bit, and the business is still going, slowly but surely. It's still a grind, but that first sale? That's the memory I cling to when things get tough.

Hi everyone,
It has been 3 years since I'm in the same room in the dorms...

So , first of all , I got a room in the dorms with 2 girls I knew from highschool ( they suggested being with them ) , it was very cool and all in the beginning until one of them started acting weirdly towards me , ignoring me , humiliating me in public and more ...

 They slowly left me behind and started hanging out together after we agree to hang out the 3 of us ... I distanced Ms from them bc that was the best I could do ... 

And once this same girl told me I'm a dumbass and I'm not supposed to be here ( we're both medical students and my scores are way higher than hers ) I told her to shut up ( I never objected B4 when she humiliates me ) and she exploded telling me curses and calling me names .... We didn't talk from that day and the two of them ignored my presence completely ... 

I thought that didn't bother me much ... Until I got sooo depressed ( bc of that girl and mom believed her every time she called telling her a lie about me ) I lost so much weight and nutrients , got treated after ... But the depression never went away...
I started having suicidal thoughts... And my grades went down ( not to the point where I don't pass ) I still passed that year ....


The year after we got a new girl in the room after the girl I didn't have a problem with left ...
We were good friends and I never thought about what's going to happen ... I always talk to her when I see her alone and we chat and laugh.... prepare teas for her when I do mine ... Give her snacks with me ... Answer her QSTs about studies if she asks .... Once when she got injured I helped her ... Once when she was sick and didn't show I asked her and stayed with her until she felt better ... Once she was crying about her grades I comforted her .... I took her to medical clubs with me .... And so much more....


Until one day she went to hang out with the other girl and came back 

she was sitting and suddenly exploded out of no where telling me I'm a piece of shit and selfish and I want to destroy people like I wanted to destroy that girl in the past , and I think I'm god and I come late to the room ( I study in a library in the dorms so I come late around 2 am but I do if opening the door putting my backpack on the ground and go to sleep immediately ) she said I always try to wake her when she's asleep by doing noise with the dishes on purpose and that when I open the door or close it , it wakes her up ... And that when I prepare coffee ( around 7 am or 8 am ) the sound of the coffee wake her up and that she hated me from the first time she saw me ( I'm not bad looking at all , most people tell me I'm pretty and although I hates to the infinity I still think I quite more beautiful than her so that wasn't the reason for her hating me on the first sight ) .... I , while she was screaming tried to calm her but there was no way 

, until she started shaking the bed and throwing things and the other girl closed the door so no one can come to rescue me... I got a panic attack and started crying then some girls came to the room and took me out ... I was crying telling them why I didn't do anything to her ....

Days passed I tried to change the room but there was no way ... 

I went into the depressional state again and I became passively suicidal again, a lot of girls offered to help me then turned their back on me , other girls that were common friends btw us stopped talking to me or just ignore me if I talk to them .... I stopped eating and studying and praying and cleaning myself for a whole month until there was 1 month left for the exam, I tried to study the hardest I could and I kinda did good in it.... I got 86/100


I'm now on vacations and I need to go back to that terror again... My body shakes everytime I see them or think about them .... I get a sick feeling always... My family are very toxic and unsupportive, I don't have any friends and I can do nothing....

Pls for someone who got similar problems in the past , what shall I do .... I think about ending ml every now and then , my parents told me if I'm not strong enough to face reality then maybe I should really end ml .... I'm afraid of hell and of the pain .... 
Pls help me find a solution or at least a solution for my mental health 🙏

# TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

>I’m a 30 M engineer from Miami who wants a teammate, someone to build an actual life with. Bilingual (English/Spanish), loyal, sarcastic, and probably overqualified for making you coffee in the mornings. Bonus points if you also think home ownership shouldn't count as an Olympic event.

Thanks, Gippity. *takes the mic back*

# Introduction

A lot of times we come on here and tell people *who* we want when we should be telling them *what* we want. A beautifully painted picture of what the day-to-day looks like as well as those more fun times. So, with that being said, here is the picture of the life I want.

# Partnership in Monotony

We're adults, working 5+ days a week just to put food on the table and reach our mutual and individual goals. There goes 40-60 hours of our time together, and we have to remove those pesky 56 hours to get 8 hours of sleep per night if we're lucky. So, we have 52-72 hours left. 52-72 hours approximately to do everything else for ourselves, our families, friends, hobbies, and us.

Wow, that's a tight window!

Yet, we have a superpower. We are a *team*.  Sitting down together after dinner and working spreadsheets, Notions, shared Google calendars, and scribbling plans together is a whole DATE. Sipping on decaf because it's too late for caffeine while we laugh about how the weekend or next week is going to be a mess. Leaning over and giving each other little kisses and looking into one another's eyes with that neurodivergent depth that reads the slight discomfort in your right knee from that gym incident when you were 19.

If we're not doing that, we're sitting on our Discord server planning roleplays and story ideas for us to work on together. Then, we have to laugh because we've been planning this RP for like 4 days and we really should just jump into it but it's OK. Then we might jump into one and spend hours just poking at each other's brains with these great stories that stimulate us mentally and emotionally. If we're not RPing, we're watching a show/movie, gaming together or parallel playing, or maybe you're watching me or I'm watching you game on stream! Could be any of those.

There's always room for silence too.

God, how hard is it for people to sit in silence? Not us. We sit in silence, doing our thing, scrolling our phones. We bump legs or we're sitting on a call just listening to the background noise. Every now and then one of us goes ""I love you"" and the other goes ""forever and always.""

Maybe it's ""Dude, you're going to let the streak die. Send me something.""

Definitely it's us planning our next trip to see each other which eventually becomes planning our move-in, then it becomes planning our dates or trips together. The years passing one by one as we watch each other get older but our connection grows deeper.

Eventually it's not just us, now it's waking up at 2 AM to inconsolable crying as we both sigh and one of us takes our turn to feed our little munchkin.

The days become watching our family grow older and bigger. Visiting family. Family visiting. Traveling together. Sending grandma and grandpa picture of their munchkins and their tired kids who are learning to be parents.

Yet, we still sit together after dinner. Just now with kids joining us. Reading together. Gaming together. Teaching them about writing and narrative structure and all that. Listening to them tell us about their hobbies and all the latest fun things and us having to study because we're getting older and we are starting to ""live under a rock"".

# The Excitement of Certain Times

When we both manage to get out of being homebodies, that's also a great time.

I don't know about you, but I love getting dressed to the 20s (the 9s is too little). Perfect outfit. Perfect perfume. Even the choice of lotion is well decided. Then... We pull up to a great reservation... Somewhere simple.

God, do I hate those super expensive places that serve you three shreds of food and you're left wanting.

Let's go get tacos then roll up to a private lounge where you need a reservation a month out just to have a few drinks and little bites. Then we step out and walk down the street along the way stopping at an antique book store before noticing there's an ice cream shop next door.

Now, I love smoking cigars (not every day obviously), so you push me along to our reservation at the cigar lounge. We pull up, hugs and kisses as per Hispanic protocol to our friends who are staff. We take our seats, order our drinks, listen to the live music, and you can watch me light my cigar with patience which shows why you love me. Maybe you'll be the type of partner that joins me in smoking a cigar (if you're not that's OK).

We have to be constantly remembering to take pictures and selfies otherwise there's never a darn record that we went out or did anything. Always more preoccupied with the vibes and capturing the landscapes that ourselves.

The conversation is always great between us as we laugh and chat, even texting the things we can't say aloud as we plan the end of the evening.

# The ""Me to You""

Who am I as a partner? Let's go bullet mode...

* You get woken up to gentle kisses and ""Your (INSERT MORNING DRINK HERE) is ready, honey. Do you want your eggs scrambled or fried? Oh, I also got fresh Cuban bread.""
* I walk over with a glass of water and a fistful of meds the moment I see you start to go under the weather or you mention a coworker/friend/family member is getting sick
* I come home with pastries/treats if I happen to be driving by one of your favorite spots
* I write you little notes to keep in your bags, desks, and other such places
* I never leave without knowing the next time I will see you
* I happily help with technology-related issues
* AND SO MUCH MORE!!!

# Who am I?

Here's the pertinent details about me...

* Located in Miami, FL but travel often for work across the southeast US and occassionally outside the southeast for conferences, trainings, and otherwise
* 5'7"" (170 cm), 165 lb (75 kg), average build
* Black short hair with equally black and short facial hair (moustache and ""beard"")
* Deep brown eyes framed with glasses
* Sleep schedule is roughly 10 PM - 7 AM, on weekends more like 11 PM - 8 AM (or 9 AM)
* Work as an electrical engineer in a fully remote position
* Main hobbies are gaming, reading/writing, cooking, photography, cigars, coffee, mixology, and now perfumes/perfumery
* Secondary hobbies include gardening, painting, interior design, and martial arts (judo, kendo, and iaido)
* Type one diabetic (T1D) since I was 4 years old, so I am insulin dependent and use an insulin pump and continous glucose monitor (CGM)
* I have a Samsung (Android)... Why is this important? You'd be surprised how it goes with the **Blue Bubble Gang**
* I am mainly a PC and PS5 gamer these days, BUT I do own an Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch. I have also successfully acquired a wonderful OLED Steamdeck I have been adoring for work and personal travel
* Some of the games I play (or have played) include: World of Warcraft (Retail & Classic), Diablo / Path of Exile, Halo (2, 3, and some Reach), Oldschool Runescape, Skyrim, and so forth
* My Steam library includes 975 games and counting at this time
* I own an Oculus Rift 2 for VR and I play PC VR games as well through Virtual Desktop
* I also enjoy board games and TTRPGs (I haven't done DnD 5e in FOREVER but am SO down to do it again)
* I am a Disney Annual Pass (AP) holder and Vacation Club (DVC) owner at the Riviera Resort (which means Skyliner access to Epcot's France and English pavilions and Hollywood Studios with ease)

# Important Details (PLEASE READ)

My main key point is that I don't care WHO you are or WHAT you look like or WHAT you're into so long as you see yourself fitting into this picture I have painted.

Every detail I wrote is important to me. There is nothing there that I can really compromise on without compromising myself and what makes my life happy to live and future worth working toward.

However, let's be clear about some of the following...

**Big details...**

* I am open to online/long-distance so long as we are BOTH putting in the work it takes
* I am only interested in cis(female) or transmale partners since I would like to start a biological family at some point
* I am NOT interested in potential partners that already have children, though potential exception may be made for those parents with children 13 years-old or older AND still healthy enough to have more children
* I am only interested in those in the United States at this point (this is due to international travel being more difficult due to my job)
* If you are NOT in the United States and STILL wish to try at this, please know that YOU will have to try to visit me instead of the other way around until I figure out the logistics of visiting your country with my job

**More about you...**

* You have a job
* You take care of yourself (e.g. if you have a medical condition you are actively treating it, you attend therapy if applicable, etc.)
* Co-habitation, long-term commitment, and having kids does NOT scare you and is a decided fact for you (not saying right off the bat but once the years pass and we reach each step), if you are unsure about any of those then maybe this isn't for you (and that's OK)",1,1767284722.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1q1829r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1q1829r/this_is_gonna_hurt_but_we_really_got_it_all/,This is gonna hurt but we really got it all backwards.,"I live in Alberta, a province in Canada with about 5 million people. It’s morning here and after my first cup of coffee of 2026, something told me to compare this place to my home country. Straight depression manze. So let’s look at the numbers. Alberta has roughly 5 million people, a GDP of about USD 250B, and a land size of 661,800 km². Kenya has over 50 million people, a GDP of about USD 136B, and a land size of 580,400 km². Let that sink in for a second.

The entire province is run by one Premier with MLAs, and then cities have mayors and municipal reps. Compare that to Kenya. A president, hundreds of MPs, 47 senators plus nominees (what’s even the point of this “nominated” BS?), county governments everywhere, governors, deputies, CECs, MCAs, the whole thing. We didn’t decentralize services, we duplicated the freaking national government. And then we’re shocked that the wage bill is eating us alive. Half of the country’s revenue pays government salaries, and we BORROW money to pay it!

What makes it more painful is real life. The moment you actually need help from a government office, it’s delays, rudi kesho runaround, and before you know it someone is hinting at kitu kidogo just to do the job they’re already paid to do. I still remember how long it took me to get a passport. Then we sit there asking tunashangaa, what’s wrong with our country. This is it, fellas. So next time someone says “Singapore of Africa” bla bla, remind them that a single province in a developed country outperforms an entire nation of over 50 million people.

Hayo tu kwa sasa. Let me know if you in favor of dismantling the whole system and building it from the ground up. ",33,1767284715.0,Kenya,22,1.0,False

I don't see droppings, no egg cases, no scattering of a bunch of roaches when I turn the lights on and off. 

For about a week or 2 before December 18th, or around then, I was seeing 1 to 3 babies each day. Occasionally, I saw an adult but rarely.

December 18 I put down raid bait stations. Since then, I sometimes only see one baby, sometimes 3. Sometimes I don't see anything but maybe I'm not noticing them. On December 28th I put down Hoy Hoy traps along the walls, in places closest to where I've seen roaches. Nothing has been caught in these traps yet.

2 days ago I eliminated a coffee machine where I found 2 visible roaches. I've changed the sweep under my front door. I clean for hours in the evening (after coming home from work and taking care of my kids). Same day I removed the coffee machine I began wiping down my kitchen sink at night and running dishwasher earlier and letting it dry before going to bed. 

Last night I saw an adult roach come out at 11 pm with lights on and two babies. This morning at 8AM, a baby roach was on my ceiling, slowly walking. Uggghhh....does it sound like nothing is working? 

I've literally lost interest in eating. I do research on roach prevention for hours. I'm nervous to walk into rooms with the lights off. All I do is clean with all the free time I have. I'm losing my mind. Please give me your honest opinion....it might be helpful in knowing where I stand.
