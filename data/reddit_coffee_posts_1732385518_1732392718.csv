A website can put your business on the battlefield. However, a well-built website can take your business to new heights, and that's exactly what I will be doing for you.

I am relatively new in the world of business. I am running my web design agency as I am completing my university education. I am young and naive in many ways when compared to seasoned entrepreneurs.

1gy8gaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/cf4cf/comments/1gy8gaa/36_m4f_vancouver_canada_area_burnaby_single_busy/,"36 [M4F] #Vancouver Canada area (#Burnaby) - Single, busy, kinky, not dating, childfree, petfree. Seeking someone for a consistent fun situation","I'm single, have enough on my plate, I'm not chasing after anything serious per say or relationship, but I'm also fully open for the right person when it happens, truth is.. I have no aversion to something committed, I'd welcome it.. but of course that would mean two connect fully and want all the same stuff from life, at this age now, I know what I like and want in life and don't want.. although, I'm just not even interested in dating right now.. for now, seeking a good mix of friendly vibes & affection.. looking for 'the one right now' and it be great if she was someone with these preferences in life of being a childfree, petfree, own independent person 

I'm 36 y/o, 6ft, Brown man, attractive, the average dadbod, stubble to shaved-ish head with a short-medium beard, am childfree & petfree, well groomed, big on hygiene, selfcare, tattooed, professional with remote/wfh job in niche market and overall a chill, levelheaded, mature, balanced individual that's not interested in games/fakeness/deception and am interested in a straightforward real woman who's a good fit that's not worried about emotions or feelings in something like this because she understands it adds to make it better; I think emotional maturity and life experience are attractive 

I'm happy to swap pic if there's interest after you introduce yourself, we can have a lowkey coffee-walk to see if there's enough mutual interest to pursue anything further.. I'm not into online stuff and want someone in metro Vancouver to connect with. I barely use any of the apps nowadays and I am terrible at forever messaging chat not having ever met plus I keep expectations low given reddit msgs I've gotten

I'm fully unattached, ie. not dating anyone or looking really, I want consistent ongoing sitch, fun vibes, chill good thing.  I'm not looking to go out and do stuff; wanting to stay in to enjoy eachother, friendly-lovers, kept private indoors is fine, overall I'm not looking for a pseudo dating relationship but do want a good connection. I prefer a longer term situation whether we call it being casual, having fun, lovers, FWB etc

I'm not in a rush so want to enjoy a fun connection and my life until that 'right match' and something serious emerges

For something meaningful, I'm an atheist, mostly apolitical, childfree and petfree as I want to live no obligation lifestyle  freely. I'm not really into the super pronoun using acronym heavy overly politically correct personalities, but a real and not hateful person is who I vibe with.. ie. who doesn't need to over correct, is somebody who doesn't actually actively have a problem with common phrases that were ok before but now are seen as offensive, someone good natured yet not uptight about perception but cares whats in your heart

For now, and the whole reason I'm on Reddit anonymously,

Seeking someone to unwind with, unplug from all the work stuff, de-stress, disconnect etc to just indulge in eachother, I enjoy D/s core dynamic in bed, I am internally Hedonistic which leads into some outward Sadistic play, I mostly have Daddy energy that overrides all of it, re: more in other posts but all that aside individual dynamic is about two energies 

& Not to make my kinks the entirety of my identity, I believe kinky sex, Dom/sub is a natural inclination, in modern time we use labels, define everything. I enjoy variances, as long as vibes sync, I tend to click best with naturally submissive leaning in bed, but not a passive personality. Any roles and labels aside, we need to click first. Everything boils down to having mutual attraction w/ some sort of energy overall. I only enjoy D/s stemming from natural power exchanges not roleplay playacting & not anything overly performative. I want someone who's genuinely internally driven/likes this

I started my journey at Palms Station and got off two stops after at La Cienega/Jefferson to get stuff at Whole Foods. The train was clean and everyone on my train car behaved like regular human beings. After I did my shopping, I took the train again one stop to Culver City to get a coffee and breakfast burrito at the recently reopened Helms Bakery. It was a 6 minute walk. After being there for a while I waited for the 33 bus across the street and got off at Venice & Culver to pick up some things at Trader Joe's. Then I walked home for about 12 minutes.

Could it have been faster driving? Probably. Then again, thanks to the Transit app's GO feature, I didn't have to wait too long at any of the stations or bus stop because it told me exactly when to start walking. Obviously it helps when you live close to a train station, which I did on purpose. I think a lot of people don't consider living close to transit when they choose an apartment and then complain that it's impossible for them to conveniently use it.",2,1732392162.0,LAMetro,0,1.0,False
1gy8fkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leeds/comments/1gy8fkt/why_are_people_averse_to_use_heating/,Why are people averse to use heating?,"Look it is cold, it has been cold, cold is the norm and sometimes it gets even colder. You have to turn on your heater.

I understand the prices have gone up but I am yet to meet a local who has any experience of using a heater regularly. They think it is a waste of money I suppose. Doing anything they can to avoid turning on the goddamn heater.

Also, considering the things they spend money on, I would think heating up space should have a higher priority (the priority currently is nil). My upstairs neighbor will drive a Tesla, regularly order take out, go out, get lashes and nails done, always have a coffee takeout in hand, they are two professionals each making more than me, yet they have been coughing for MONTHS. It is always the same they just leech off my heater but when I am not home, even if it is freezing they won't turn the heater on. They are clueless, had they turn their heater on and kept it at reasonable setting, both of us would pay reasonable amounts and have warm space. 

It was the same where I was staying before too. The live in land lady was adamant to never turning the heater on. She would blow money on drinking and buyinh anything and everything else. Neighbors as well, they kept chronically caughing for months as well. A couple whose apartment I visited to rent had a wine cooler and fanciest furniture but the heater on, their house was freezing and the kind of freezing which comes from wet, cold, never heated up walls and floors.

Only exception was an immigrant and they would just warm up half of the house. 

Below 16 is inhabitable, and UK gov actually ""recommends 18"" to basically not wreck up your health. European countries ""mandate"" at least 16 in apartment complexes, whether you are in or out. You could also damage your house as not heating up regularly will lead to mold, your pipes frozen, your boiler malfunction. Heating regularly at reasonable settings is also cost effective. You are definitely spending more if you keep turning it on and off completely but of course this doesn't apply to my neighbors who never turn it on.

Don't get me startes with lack of insultion.

1gy8fkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/1gy8fkl/program_review_juggernaut_20/,[Program Review] Juggernaut 2.0,"Stats  
Age: 34
Gender: Male  
Height: 185cm  
Weight 79Kg (lost 2kgs)  
  
Summary Kgs (lbs)  
Front Squat 97.5->97.5x3 (220)
Bench 110x1 -> 100x4 (225)
Deadlift 165->160x5 (352)
Behind the Neck Press 72-> 66x3 (145)
  
Program Overview  
Juggernaut 2.0 is designed to be for developing all round athleticism. The focus is on sub maximal jumping, lifting and sprinting because the only irreplaceable part sports training is the sport itself.  Theres only one set in the 16 week program for each lift at 90% of your training max, which is lower than your true 1rm or estimated 1rm.
The lifts are run in 4 week cycles focusing on 10 reps, 8 reps, 5 reps and 3 reps with a deload every 4th week.  
I did the ""What I Do"" for the accessories (Pullups, Dips, Ab Wheel, Good Mornings, Hamstrings, Lunges, Squats) and used simplified conditioning (30s '@ 70% Watts rowing, 8 press ups, 10 sit ups, 15s Rest) but dropped conditioning during the 3s wave as i was running low on time and figured i could get conditioning from Judo.
I know inverted is Chad Wesley Smith's preferred way of running Juggernaut nowadays but 10x5 and 8x5 was a little too similar to my previous rep schemes and at far lower weights. I've also never really pushed myself on higher reps so decided to do the original program.
Some people have called the program High Volume, but given 1/4 s deloads, 1/4 is building to a single AMRAP set its only the Initialisation weeks that is high volume and then only really for the first few waves.
  
My Background  
I ran [Juggernaut earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/s/BxfqyRL0Cp) and am a massive fan. This time I've learnt to trust the program and haven't taken an extra couple of weeks to retest my 1rm, preferring to keep training and adding reps. 

Before Juggernaut I'd run a powerbuilding program that i added cardio to. This meant i was doing 6 weight sessions a week 40 minutes-1 hour and 5 cardio session of 30 minutes. And with getting changed, grabbing a coffee and prep this was taking 10 hours a week. I've got a young son so that sort of routine was no longer viable.
  
I do Judo mainly so Strength and Conditioning isnt going to be my priority, i also have a 20 month old, so i was missing sessions and cutting assistance / cardio short all over the place, saying I'd do abs later and forgetting about stretching.
  
What I liked  
Doing abs first as a pulse raiser/warm up means i don't skip them. Workouts can be done in an hour. Adding sprinting in really helped with general athelicism. My jumps continue to get heavier.
Emphasis on pullups and dips kept my focus on clean eating as putting on water weight really inhibits my ability to crank them out.
Four days a week gives a lot of flexibility for when life gets in the way, even if you have to go away with work for a couple of days you can move the workouts around.   
Sub maximal training meant i wasnt destroying myself before a Judo session, and especially on the deload weeks i could perform really highly in training (sport training has too many variables based on lesson plan, who shows up to plan intensity so having a lot left in the tank is useful)  
  
Conclusion  
I managed to gain strength whilst losing weight which is a great combo; Im not spending longer in the gym and at least on my lower body lifts im close to my 1rm from 16 weeks ago and doing them for reps. On upper body my bench isnt progressing as quicklt due to the lower increments so it might be time to start focusing on hitting that harder. Im not happy with my Behind the Neck Press form so im going to lower my training max and essentially go from a dead stop rather than rebounding as my reualts have been inconsitent.
  
Whats next  
The weights section of program seems to be heavily inspired by 5/3/1 so im going to run that until Christmas and do another Juggernaut 2.0 in the new year.
  
Tl;Dr: would highly recommend Juggernaut 2.0 to someone looking for all around athleticism and training around another sport.",1,1732392152.0,fitness30plus,0,1.0,False

Conflicting information on label vs website and time vs usage","We purchased a fairly new townhome late last year (just over 1 year old) that came with a very nice but probably over-the-top whole home filter system.  It's a two-stage Filtri-brand 20"" pre-filter feeding into a Halo 5.  Original homeowner said it cost about $6K to purchase and have installed.  Probably not a system I would have bought myself, but the water tastes incredible (good or better than bottled) and there's no scale buildup on anything either on move-in or after 9 months here.  The Atlas Filtri 20"" filters are a mesh/carbon filter and a scale reduction filter (media).  The mesh/carbon seems redundant with the Halo 5, but once again we can't argue with the results.

My question is on the 20"" x 4.5"" RA5777608 Scale/Sediment filter.  The label says 100,000 gallons or 12 months, and the web site says 100K gallons or 6 months.  We use less than 2000 gallons a month (not sure how much less, that's the minimum water usage billing and we've never gone over that.)  How much is the time the filter is immersed in water a factor vs flow rate?  The carbon filter is also 6 months / 100,000 gallons, but I know carbon looses effectiveness over time.  Not sure why it's even in the loop with the Halo 5, but it's a $15 filter.  The scale filter is much more expensive at nearly $100.  I'm curious how long that scale filter is good for if we're using it for a tenth it's rated flow capacity over a 12 month period?  

The water here in North Texas is 'moderately hard' according to the test strips, and that scale media filter seems to be doing a great job.  A year at my old house (no filter on anything but the fridge and coffee machine) had the shower heads and taps coated in scale.  There's not s spot of scale anywhere here, so I like the job it's doing.  Just wondering how often I really need to change that filter given our very low usage rate.",1,1732391610.0,WaterTreatment,0,1.0,False

1gy85og,https://www.reddit.com/r/optimiseyoursleep/comments/1gy85og/3_tips_to_optimise_your_coffee_intake_for_better/,3 tips to optimise your coffee intake for better sleep,"These tips are super easy to implement and anecdotally have had a massive positive impact on my sleep - these are a great place to start as it takes practically no extra effort to implement.

**1. Wait 2 Hours After Waking Up to Have Your First Coffee**

When you wake up, your body naturally starts producing cortisol, a hormone that helps you feel alert and energized. Drinking coffee right away can interfere with this natural process. Instead, waiting about 1.5 to 2 hours allows your cortisol levels to peak as they should, helping you feel more awake naturally without relying on caffeine.

Additionally, delaying coffee gives adenosine, the sleep-regulating chemical that builds up in your brain during the day, a chance to clear out fully. If you drink caffeine immediately, it blocks adenosine too early, which can cause you to feel less alert later in the day when the caffeine wears off. By timing your first cup later in the morning, you‚Äôll get a more effective energy boost and help stabilize your sleep-wake cycle.

**2. Stop Drinking Coffee Early Enough Before Bed**

Caffeine has a long half-life, meaning it takes about 5-6 hours for your body to process half of it. For some people, it can take up to 10 hours for caffeine to completely leave the system. If you‚Äôre drinking coffee too close to bedtime, it can suppress adenosine buildup and keep you from feeling sleepy when you need to rest.

To avoid this, consider your sleep schedule and set a personal caffeine cut-off time. For example:

‚Ä¢ If you go to bed at 10 PM, stop drinking coffee by 2 PM.

‚Ä¢ If you‚Äôre more sensitive to caffeine, you may need to stop even earlier, around noon.

Pay attention to hidden sources of caffeine, like tea, chocolate, or sodas, especially in the evening. If you‚Äôre craving a warm drink at night, opt for herbal teas like chamomile or peppermint, which promote relaxation without disrupting sleep.

**3. Take Regular Coffee Breaks to Reset Your Tolerance**

When you consume caffeine regularly, your body adjusts by increasing the number of adenosine receptors in your brain. This means you‚Äôll need more caffeine to achieve the same energy boost, and it can also make you feel groggier when you don‚Äôt have it. This increased tolerance can interfere with both your energy levels during the day and your ability to sleep at night.

To reset your caffeine tolerance and improve your sleep, consider taking a break from coffee for a few days to a week. This gives your brain time to return to its natural balance. If quitting cold turkey feels daunting, gradually reduce your intake over a few days to avoid withdrawal symptoms like headaches or irritability.

Once you return to drinking coffee, you‚Äôll likely find that a smaller amount gives you the same alertness, reducing the overall caffeine load on your system and making it easier to maintain better sleep quality.

By implementing these tips, you can enjoy your coffee while keeping your sleep routine intact!",1,1732391410.0,optimiseyoursleep,0,1.0,False

My goal is to have a guide for more consistent brews, especially when dialing in different coffees.

Interestingly, the 1Zpresso website states that each click adjusts the grind by 12.5 microns and the total range is 1210 microns. However, with 300 total clicks (5 rotations x 60 clicks per rotation), the math works out to 4.03 microns per click instead.

Usually, I take notes about the coffee I brew, like the grind settings, brew time, and taste results. Would calculating the grind size in microns (even if it‚Äôs an estimate) actually help refine the process? Or is it better to just stick to click counts and adjust based on trial and error?

All night I kept building the courage to say hi, but every single time I got dragged into something else (One of the other bartenders having to do stock and I need to watch the bar, about to approach her on my smoke break before my boss asks me to finish quickly, etc.). Eventually I lost sight of them and assumed they'd left, until I went to go clean the bathrooms near the end of the night and they were standing there. I made a polite comment about their hat and started cleaning a toilet, when they asked if I was gay and if I wanted to go on a date. At the end of the night, she kissed me on the cheek as she left the bar, and I proceeded to scream in the stock cupboard because of how flustered I was.

Well, today, we went out for coffee. I was super nervous and I feel like I looked like an idiot the entire time, but I've also never been so interested by a person before. Luckily, I didn't scare them off, and we're going out again some time next week. I've never felt so relieved, especially moreso because I didn't do something stupid and ruin it for once. I just feel like I need to share my excitement with a bunch of strangers before I start writing it in a notebook like a giggling schoolgirl.",13,1732390719.0,latebloomerlesbians,0,0.93,False

I don't crave cigarettes anymore. Sometimes, in the morning, I kinda wish I could have one with my coffee. Or in social gatherings, when I'm surrounded by smokers, I think, maybe I could light one too. But then I compare my breathing now to how it used to be, and I decide, Hell no! All of this happens in less than two seconds.

To those of you who haven't taken the step yet‚Äîdo it. It's worth it. And to those of you struggling through the first month, hang in there. I promise, it's really worth it. You don't need a cigarette right now.

A few minutes later, I spot him stumbling up the sidewalk. He‚Äôs mumbling something I can‚Äôt understand but its clear he's more intox than anything.

My partner at the booth steps out to intercept.

Partner: Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?

Intox: (slurring) Yeah... I‚Äôm, uh, looking for Shirley. Or Jesse, yea Jesse!

The guy walks past my partner, heading straight for the building. I make sure to keep eyes on him while calling it in.

Intox: (Slurring) Are... are you... seen Shirley?

Supervisor: Oh, Shirley? Yea, I just saw her head out past the gate.

Intox: (shaking his head) Nah... she's still here. Are you Jesse?

The guy isn‚Äôt drunk enough to buy that apparently.

Me: (Waves him my way toward the exit) Hey, how about a coffee? You want a coffee?

Intox: (pausing) Yeah... half and half, 5 sugars.

Intox: (grinning) So, how do I become a security guard?

Me: Well, first step is getting certified. After that‚Äî

This may be an odd question, but this is what I quite often want to do with my kids on the weekend so that my wife could rest, and I haven‚Äôt found a good place to do so!

I am looking for a **place where I could take my kids for a breakfast or a coffee-tea-soda-dessert and while we are there, play games that we will bring ourselves (uno / crew / lost cities - so short) and/or study and do homework with them**.

What would be a good fit for this? I am thinking some place with relatively large tables and where the staff won‚Äôt be hating is for sitting there too long / won‚Äôt be trying to rush us out. I am **not looking for a board game club /meetup**, but rather for a place that will be welcoming to it.

Snack was yogurt, berries and walnuts (19 g bc I haven‚Äôt replaced my yogurt type yet). We went on a 1.5 mile walk at toddler + 30 weeks pregnant pace.

Lunch was a salad with chicken, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, a bit of sliced apple, feta cheese and a 1/2 c of chickpeas. (50 g carbs) Glucose level was 109 at 1 hour.

While there they ended up drugging us with magic mushrooms. We completely freaked out and I was like is this even my family I was so out of it.
They took my phone away from me and refused to let me call my dad. So I passed out and when I woke up they were laughing and said ya a couple lesbians can't handle a few shrooms. Then I got hold of my dad and begged him to fetch me and he did and we left my car there so we climbed in his bakkie and they told my dad to have coffee and then they brought us coffee and I refused to drink it I threw the cup our the window.  Dad told me I'm talking shit and my ouma did too. And then I don't know what they told my family but it caused so much shit we went a long time not talking. 
Till this day they don't believe me.
Oh and while we were freaking out these people were praying for us and that's why I was so anti religion because of them and thar night  

Anyway after a few years I saw them and my dad n I stayed at their house and I refused to eat anything they made I bought my own food or me n my dad cooked luckily we were only visiting for a few days.

Anyway this woman has now messaged me on whatsapp and I don't want to talk to her. So I told my ouma I'm not going to reply and now my oyma is pissed off with me. 

And I actually after all these years want to heal from that night I have night mares and panic attacks often when I get too high and I start feeling like I did that night and it's stuck with me and I want her to admit it. She's kak sick and almost dying.

So....

I‚Äôm looking for a friend who enjoys meditating and exploring nature. Probably once or twice a month. Some of my favorite spots are Clegg Gardens and the woodland trail at Cumberland Park on the west side. If the weather isn‚Äôt cooperative, I‚Äôm also open to meditating at home, especially during the colder months.

I‚Äôm pretty introverted and not really a ‚Äòbro‚Äô kind of guy, so if you aren't either, you‚Äôre in good company. I respect all genders, ages, and backgrounds, and I‚Äôm fascinated by spiritual topics and different beliefs. I was raised Catholic, and while I‚Äôm not currently practicing, I respect where Catholics come from.

Being mobile is important to me as I enjoy hiking moderate trails. I‚Äôm also quite frugal and prefer not to eat out, but I‚Äôm happy to share snacks or coffee/tea at home or on a trail. Just let me know if you have any allergies or dietary preferences (vegetarian/vegan).

My brother used to be my hiking and meditation buddy, but he moved away about a year ago. He was a conservative evangelical Christian, and although we didn‚Äôt share all the same beliefs, we respected and listened to each other.

It would be a plus if you have a relaxing space. My husband and I have a library, a 70‚Äôs style lower level, and a garden that‚Äôs getting an overhaul next year. If you think we might click, feel free to message me so we can chat :)

There's this 1,700 SF vacant space in a high foot traffic area right next to one of the 3 major coffee shops in the area, not the one I'm working at, and I sometimes grab lunch here because my coffee shop only sells pastry items, and I've noticed there are a lot of freelancers, gig workers, students, artists, and all kinds of folks who frequent this shop, and the shop stays open til 7pm.

There are plenty of apartments, restaurants, and retail stores in the area, a community college about 10 mins away, and even though my town has some indie bookstores on the east side, there are none in this particular area.

So I called the real estate agent and he said the cost to lease this space is $3.50 a SF, and I gathered some data from ChatGPT, and here are my potential Startup costs and monthly operating costs for this business.

Also, bare in mind I know nothing about running a business so I'm going to have to consult with the local SBDC and get some guidance from there, and of course I'm going to need an angel loan from a relative or an acquaintance who'd be willing to front me the capital.

1gy78n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ReputationFast7107/comments/1gy78n4/how_netflix_stays_up_a_peek_into_its_devops_magic/,"How Netflix Stays Up: A Peek into Its DevOps Magic
","Ever wondered how Netflix streams your favorite shows without ever buffering, no matter where you are in the world? Behind the scenes is a fascinating¬†**DevOps architecture**¬†that ensures seamless scalability, reliability, and zero downtime. Let‚Äôs dive into the magic that keeps Netflix binge-worthy 24/7. üçø

In this blog, we‚Äôll explore Netflix‚Äôs DevOps architecture, real-world examples, business cases.

# Why Netflix Needs DevOps

Imagine you‚Äôre binge-watching¬†*Stranger Things*, and the screen freezes. Nightmare, right? With millions of viewers relying on Netflix, uptime is a business-critical priority for:

1. **User Satisfaction:**¬†Downtime impacts user experience and loyalty.
2. **Revenue Protection:**¬†Netflix loses money every second it‚Äôs offline.
3. **Global Scalability:**¬†Operating in multiple regions requires resilient systems.

DevOps ensures that Netflix delivers seamless, uninterrupted streaming to every user, every time.

# Pillars of Netflix‚Äôs DevOps Architecture

# 1. Microservices: Divide and Conquer

Netflix‚Äôs platform runs on¬†**microservices**, each dedicated to a specific task like recommendations, billing, or playback. This decoupled architecture ensures that if one service fails, others remain unaffected.

# Business Case:

If the recommendation engine fails, users can still stream their favorite shows without any interruptions.

# Code Example:

Here‚Äôs a simple microservices deployment snippet in Kubernetes:

    apiVersion: apps/v1  
    kind: Deployment  
    metadata:  
      name: recommendation-service  
    spec:  
      replicas: 3  
      selector:  
        matchLabels:  
          app: recommendation  
      template:  
        metadata:  
          labels:  
            app: recommendation  
        spec:  
          containers:  
          - name: recommendation  
            image: netflix/recommendation:v1.0  
            ports:  
            - containerPort: 8080

Netflix uses similar practices to scale individual services independently.

# 2. Cloud Infrastructure: Built on AWS

Netflix relies on¬†**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**¬†for its global operations, leveraging:

* **Auto-scaling**¬†to handle traffic surges.
* **Multi-region Deployments**¬†for disaster recovery and load balancing.

# Example:

During the launch of¬†*Stranger Things*¬†Season 4, a 40% surge in traffic was handled effortlessly as AWS scaled Netflix‚Äôs infrastructure dynamically.

# 3. Continuous Delivery: Seamless Updates

Netflix uses¬†**Spinnaker**, its in-house continuous delivery (CD) platform, to deploy thousands of code changes daily with no downtime.

# Code Example:

A Spinnaker pipeline for deployment might look like this:

    codestages:  
      - name: DeployPlaybackService  
        config:  
          cloudProvider: aws  
          deploy:  
            cluster: playback-prod  
            strategy: red-black

This ensures that new deployments don‚Äôt disrupt ongoing services, enabling zero-downtime updates.

# Spinnaker in Netflix‚Äôs DevOps Workflow

Netflix uses Spinnaker to deploy thousands of updates daily across its global infrastructure. Here‚Äôs how it fits into their workflow:

1. **Trigger:**¬†A developer pushes code to a Git repository.
2. **Build & Artifact:**¬†The CI system (like Jenkins) builds the code and generates a Docker image.
3. **Pipeline Execution:**¬†Spinnaker pipeline deploys the new version to a test environment.
4. **Validation:**¬†Automated tests or manual approvals validate the release.
5. **Production Deployment:**¬†The pipeline deploys the changes to production using safe strategies like Canary or Red/Black.

# 4. Chaos Engineering: Breaking Things to Build Resilience

Netflix‚Äôs¬†**Chaos Monkey**¬†deliberately breaks parts of the infrastructure to test its resilience. It‚Äôs a critical tool to identify vulnerabilities before they impact users.

**Chaos Monkey**¬†randomly terminates instances in production to test if the system can recover without downtime.

    chaos-monkey --terminate-instances --region us-east-1

# Example:

Simulating a regional failure allows engineers to validate that traffic can be rerouted seamlessly to other regions.

# 5. Real-time Monitoring: Proactive Problem Solving

Netflix monitors millions of metrics using tools like¬†**Atlas**, its telemetry platform. Metrics include:

* API response times.
* Playback buffering rates.
* Server health indicators.

# Code Example:

A sample alert rule in Netflix‚Äôs monitoring system might look like this:

    json{  
      ""alert"": {  
        ""metric"": ""playback_errors"",  
        ""threshold"": 5,  
        ""duration"": ""1m"",  
        ""action"": ""trigger-alert""  
      }  
    }

This proactive approach ensures issues are fixed before they impact users.

# [6.How](http://6.How) Netflix Uses Hystrix for Fault Tolerance

Hystrix is a¬†**latency and fault-tolerant library**¬†developed by Netflix to handle failures gracefully in distributed systems

* **What It Does:**¬†Prevents a service from repeatedly trying to call a failing dependency.
* **How It Works:**¬†When failures exceed a defined threshold, the circuit ‚Äúopens,‚Äù and calls to the problematic service are skipped. Instead, fallback mechanisms (e.g., default responses) are used.

# Example of Graceful Degradation:

* **Scenario:**¬†The recommendation service is down.
* **Without Hystrix:**¬†The platform would hang or crash when fetching recommendations.
* **With Hystrix:**¬†The fallback mechanism might serve a default list of popular shows instead of personalized recommendations. Users still have a seamless experience, even if the service is degraded.

# Netflix DevOps in Action: Real-World Scenarios

# Example 1: Handling Traffic Spikes

When¬†*Stranger Things*¬†launched, Netflix faced a massive traffic spike. Auto-scaling, enabled by DevOps, automatically provisioned extra resources to handle the load, ensuring uninterrupted streaming.

# Example 2: Personalized Recommendations

Netflix‚Äôs recommendation engine processes massive datasets in real time. DevOps ensures that updates to these algorithms roll out seamlessly, keeping the platform personalized and engaging.

# Business Benefits of Netflix‚Äôs DevOps Practices

1. **99.99% Uptime:**¬†Minimal disruptions lead to happier customers.
2. **Faster Deployments:**¬†Thousands of updates roll out daily without downtime.
3. **Cost Optimization:**¬†Automated scaling reduces unnecessary expenses.
4. **Global Reliability:**¬†Multi-region architecture ensures uninterrupted service worldwide.

# What Happens Without DevOps?

Picture this:

* You press play, and it buffers‚Ä¶
* Then an error message pops up:¬†*‚ÄúService unavailable.‚Äù*
* Chaos ensues ‚Äî people rage-quit, and popcorn flies across the room.

Thanks to Netflix‚Äôs DevOps magic, this nightmare stays fictional.

***Devin Townsend Project - Z¬≤ (2015)***  
*Ziltoid the Omniscient* is a metal concept album created by the brains of Strapping Young Lad's Devin Townsend, about an extraterrestrial commander on a mission to find the universe's best cup of coffee. Yeah, it's a doozy. *Z¬≤* is the sequel to this album in which Dominique Persi plays a character named Queen Blattaria, or the War Princess. The album was performed once in its entirety at Royal Albert Hall, where you can see Dominique performing live as Queen Blattaria! ([video here](https://youtu.be/tEFgGMgH_Sc?feature=shared&t=1156))  
Her main song on the album is [War Princess](https://youtu.be/Fp3j1bvc8R8?feature=shared), but she also has some minor lines in [Ziltoidian Empire](https://youtu.be/3RlYNwHbVNI?feature=shared), [March of the Poozers](https://youtu.be/1NGQjRMXg28?feature=shared), and [Through the Wormhole](https://youtu.be/vYJLIUbHtUY?feature=shared) as well.

***Radioactive Chicken Heads - Tales From The Coop (2017)***  
Radioactive Chicken Heads is a comedy ska-punk-metal band made up of mutant chickens and vegetables... don't ask. In their song [Wiccan Chicken](https://youtu.be/rSwPNYS5s5c?feature=shared), Dominique plays the part of a chicken witch who is appropriately named Wiccan Chicken.

***Thrillsville - Say Goodbye To The Light (2020)***  
Thrillsville is the side project of Stolen Babies bassist/guitarist/etc., Rani Sharone. This darkwave gothic electronic album contains remixes of Stolen Babies' [So Close](https://youtu.be/QfcXEkxIA_0?feature=shared) and [Second Sleep](https://youtu.be/MI5VXZl3oGM?feature=shared), sung by Rani with new instrumentals and additional vocals by Dominique.

***Ali Pips - Black Dahlia Smile Me (2021)***  
This is definitely one to check out if you're into the whole dark cabaret shebang. Ali Pips is a jazz pianist and vocalist that explores avant-rock genres across her work, with a feature from Dominique as both a vocalist and accordionist on the song [Black Dahlia Smile Me](https://alipips.bandcamp.com/track/black-dahlia-smile-me-feat-dominique-lenore-persi).

***Circle of Sighs - His Box (2022)***  
A cover of Dalis Car's 1984 song [His Box](https://youtu.be/sCVHGxEpl50?feature=shared)*,* sung entirely by Dominique with heavy distorted guitar courtesy of metal band Circle of Sighs.

***Ego Plum & Danny Elfman - Aliens, Clowns & Geeks (2022)***  
*Aliens, Clowns & Geeks* is a 2019 movie by Richard Elfman. Very bizarre and entertaining movie, if bad movies are your thing. Kind of like Killer Klowns on killer krack. Anyway, the movie's soundtrack, composed by Ego Plum and the legendary Danny Elfman, released in 2022 with [Stupid Love Machine](https://youtu.be/QCUR6B2GJSg?feature=shared), an alternate version of one of the character's themes containing vocals by Dominique Persi.

1gy72uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/1gy72uz/coffee_grounds_question/,Coffee Grounds question ,"Hi all, thanks in advance for considering my serious question. 

I have been dabbling in gardening for many years. I've grown multiple varieties of tomatoes, zucchini, chard, peppers, citrus, beans, etc...  I always have something in the ground growing and lucky enough to be physically located where you can grow year round outside. I have always had great success using my old used coffee grounds as an ammendment to the soil and in my composter mix.

I received a big #10 can of coffee grounds from a friend that is still sealed. I don't want to sound like a coffee snob, but it is a bottom of the barrel brand that I would personally never drink or serve to guests.

Does anyone know whether you have to ""use"" the coffee first by brewing it before adding it to the soil or compost? Is there some sort of chemical reaction or change that happens to the grounds when the boiling temperature water is poured over it? Or could it be added in to the soil or compost pile in the ""powdered"" form and just cold watered in? Taking this one step further, what if it was just the roasted coffee beans? I would imagine it would take longer to break down in the soil, but wouldn't it be like a time released type of fertilizer/ammendment? 

This has been bugging me for a while and no one that I know really has an answer, just guesses.  Any help would be much appreciated.  Hope you have a great day. 

Thank you.",1,1732388594.0,gardening,7,1.0,False

I am seeking a unique, laid back woman who enjoys a night in on the couch and a movie, with snacks a plenty and just the two of us enjoying each other‚Äôs company, she cares about her health, is there for me as i am there for her, and like me, she too is looking for the first voice we hear in the morning and the last voice at days end as we say goodnight. She cares about those around her, is protective of them and has a style that is all her own. 

Phone calls where we lose track of time, fun roadtrips and travel to both exotic places or only a few hours away (its the company as well as the experience) coffee and long conversations, building new memories and inside jokes together and so much more.. 

About me, my hobbies are photography and writing and cooking and you can find me in my element, barefoot on the beach with a coffee in my hand and just enjoying the sand and waves, I love music of all kinds and can relax with Jazz like Miles, Sanborn and Yellowjackets or rock out to Pantera, Rainbow and Rush, and 80‚Äôs is my favorite genre for music and movies, I am 420 friendly but don‚Äôt smoke and rarely drink. I am a jeans and t-shirt guy but can also clean up nice too if you want a night out on the town, I am more of a homebody generally and choose snacks and a couple of movies with you on the couch on a rainy fall weekend over most things but again it‚Äôs the company and we can have fun at a street fair or farmers market or hell even doing laundry can be fun when it‚Äôs the right person. Bonus points for a good heart, sense of humor and fans of puns and Dad jokes. 

At the end of the day we all are looking for someone to connect with and continue to grow with. I completely understand that currently you only see this as words on a screen, so let‚Äôs chat and see how we vibe and take things from there, naturally and organically and see if we connect. Start here then in time maybe move to Discord to text and voice chat. The only thing we have to lose is a missed opportunity. 

Location matters so USA based people only, Age matters too as I prefer someone younger than me, I took time to write this and you took time to read it so please give me a response longer than a few words, tell me your favorite things and your favorite band or 80‚Äôs film. No more hide and seek, time to come out of wherever you are hiding and be found, your picture gets mine in response.  Have a great day and thanks for reading my short novel here üòÜ

1gy6y2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gy6y2n/aita_for_being_unhelpful_towards_my_mother_in_a/,"AITA for being ""unhelpful"" towards my mother in a situation? ","I(17F), was just chilling in the living room two hours ago while my mom, who was distracted by talking to one of my aunts on FaceTime, accidentally started her coffee machine without putting her cup under the brewer. This caused the coffee to spill everywhere. 

For context: My mom is quite the definition of a ""ticking time bomb"". Almost anything can set her off in rage. Even minor inconveniences. So naturally, her spilling coffee already set her in a bad mood. 
She asked me to help her clean up the mess. My mother scares me badly when she's upset, as I find myself in her wrath of blame and hurtful insults. So when I accidentally knocked over some tinfoil pans while frantically trying to help to diminish her anger, that of course set her off. 

She then proceeded to yell at me and forced me to hold the whole coffee machine up while she cleaned the surface where the machine is placed. When she saw me struggling to keep the machine in the air, she snapped at me and told me that ""if I helped her out more instead of having her do all the work, I would be able to lift objects."" 
My mom and I both have very similar strength. (Sometimes I am even able to lift heavy things she herself should be able to carry, but can't. I wasn't struggling because it was heavy, but because it was dripping hot freshly brewed coffee on my hands, which you can imagine that the burning sensation doesn't feel good.) 

Eventually the mess was cleaned, but remember when I said I dropped some tinfoil pans while helping? One ended up falling behind two large containers. My mom refused to help me move the heavy containers and called me slow, unhelpful, and several other insults that made me feel like a burden. 
Finally after a few minutes, my mom brewed new coffee, ended to call with my aunt, and went to her room. But not before she told me that she would work so much more efficiently without having to deal with my mistakes, and that I couldn't seem to do any simple thing right. 

I ended up crying to myself and now I don't know how to feel. On one hand, I feel bad because my mom does work a lot and she was reasonably still tired from packing some things up yesterday since we're moving soon. I didn't mean to upset her more and I admit I should've watched where I was going. But on the other, I feel that it is unfair that she took anger out on me for a mistake she made. I do actually try to help her with things, but when I do, she'll either not notice, not care, or complain and critic every job I do because ""I don't do it the way she does it"", and ends up doing it herself to how SHE wants it, while complaining that she has to do everything around the house. Not only that but she is now talking to me as if nothing happened. 
I know she loves me and that she's stressed, but I find it hard to keep giving her the benefit of the doubt since she can't control her anger and can spout such obscenities towards her own daughter without so much as even a blink or a minute of contemplating.

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm on a mission to take better care of my teeth and gums since i developed a severe restrictive eating disorder with purging episodes and reading up the effects it has on your teeth, which led me to find out about periodontitis.

I had an appointment a few weeks ago, tbe dentist said my gums and teeth looked great, apart from the coke zero and coffee stains and the huge calculus buildup behind my permanent retainer. 

But there was one big thing he noticed and it was my enamel. I had some significant erosion, he clocked my ED immediately due to the fucked up enamel and other physical signs, i told him about my issues, and he was super understanding but also really serious. He explained that my super restrictive diet could lead to bone loss and other complications, like osteoporosis which would further accelerate bone loss, dry mouth, and erosion because of the purging. 


I‚Äôm planning to get the permanent retainer replaced with a removable one soon. I have two mild black triangles where the biggest calculus deposits used to be. They‚Äôre not too bad, like the ones you see on Google Images, but they‚Äôre still noticeable, especially when I suck in my saliva. My gums are light pink, don‚Äôt hurt, and don‚Äôt bleed at all.


I vowed to stop purging after the appointment, and so far, so good! He then referred me to a periodontist as he said periodontitis isn't always visible to the naked eye and he could get me a discount for the whole appointment since they know each other.

Since then, bought a basic Sonicare toothbrush, a waterflosser (which I‚Äôm thinking of upgrading to a Waterpik branded one), and a better Sonicare with a pressure sensor and gum massage mode. I‚Äôve been oil pulling every day, flossing, and using interdental brushes for the area where my permanent retainer is installed.

While I wait for my next appointment, I heard that Xylitol is great for people with gum disease. Unfortunately, I live in the middle of nowhere and could only find it in liquid form mixed with sucralose. Does it still work as a mouthwash or tea additive, or does the granulated version interact differently with the bacteria in your mouth?

Sorry for the long post. I‚Äôm just feeling anxious and English is not my native language.

Addendum: I also have some gum with xylitol in it but it isn't the main ingredient and i have TMJ so chewing gum isn't really recommended so... :/

The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Couple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Cool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don't we need those? Copy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Chemical-y. Careful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Candy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Coming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Come on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Can I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Come on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Can I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out your job and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Cinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Crazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Check out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Chung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bee Jesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Case number 4475, Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Call your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a bad fella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Could you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Can't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Cannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me.

Outside of my period I struggle to cook without a recipe. I usually have a cup of coffee in the morning and end up working most of the day and eating once at night. Most of the time I am too exhausted to cook and clean up a meal. 

I already don‚Äôt eat red meat and try to stick to little dairy. I‚Äôve started incorporating probiotics, kombucha, and added fiber powder, and fruit smoothies throughout the week. I‚Äôve even cut down my caffeine intake to mostly decaf coffee in the morning.

I thought to my self that was nice and moved on. Moments later I am standing her and what seemed to be her father. She glanced back twice half smiling breaking eye contact before making it again. The 3rd time she looked back and she glanced at the menu board, but not before again glancing at me.

On to my question, with how that scenario played out, would it have been okay to introduce my self anywhere in that interaction? Or should I just chalk it up too; a nice moment I shared with a complete stranger.

A coworker has been asking me to travel to Vietnam with her and her family for the last couple of years and I'm finally going. She's going to visit her family for a month and I'm going to meet with her and her family for a couple days and maybe go bar hopping or whatever we'll do.

A little bit about me: I grew up multicultural, but basically Puerto Rican. I'm active in that I cycle and I enjoy touring cities on foot exploring nooks and crannies from book stores to hole in the wall food stalls. I love immersing myself in culture and exploring how others enjoy living their lives. I'll go high and low for the best cup of coffee. I'm pescatarian that leans heavy into vegetarian, but I don't care if you eat meat. Just understand that I will actively be seeking vegetarian foods.

I have lots of experience riding dirt bikes and got my international driver permit so maybe I'll rent a scooter. 

Don't forget to get your visa if Vietnam requires it from your home country!",1,1732387419.0,travelpartners,0,1.0,False
1gy6lg2,https://i.redd.it/pomdg9o05p2e1.jpeg,Need advice - is it possible I have Chrons?,"Hi, I‚Äôm new to Reddit and not sure if this is the right place to post, but I‚Äôve been having a lot of digestive issues and looking for advice, I feel absolutely lost. 
- this will be a very long post, TLDR below with lab/test results

Background:
I have been having urgent diarrhea on and off for a couple years. It used to be just spicy food and coffee, then progressed to:
- Heavy fats (fried foods, heavy cream, if I have a lot of cheese) 
- Lettuce/leafy greens like spinach  (almost always will have diarrhea) 
- alcohol especially sparking and red wine
- non-alcoholic carbonation 
- If I have too much raw fruit
- Occasionally if I have a lot of pasta 

Now this year, it seems like no matter what I eat, I randomly get urgent diarrhea - with my stomach making very loud sounds, light cramping and I would have to rush to the bathroom often several times. Typically these bouts last for a few days to a week and randomly start again. 

I‚Äôm not that much a fan of doctors, but I was finally able to get my first appointment with my Naturopath in July. I explained all my symptoms to her and she had me do blood tests and two types of stool tests. She also had me start taking a teaspoon of glutamine everyday. Sometimes I thought it helped and then a whole week I had diarrhea while I was still taking it - think the glutamine helps with a little less urgency, but still have diarrhea. 

Tests came back and found nothing wrong with my thyroid, tested negative for celiac, no blood found in my stool, but my calprotectin was 1570. 

Saw my naturopath again and she said that I have active inflammation which would rule out IBS and said it‚Äôs probably Chrons, colitis, or an infection. (I also have a family history of IBD - my dad has ulcerative colitis and my maternal first cousin has Chrons - ileitis, paternal great grandfather had UC and another great grandmother had IBD (unsure what type) but she died of colon cancer).

Anyways, my naturopath suggested I see a gastroenterologist. Saw my gastro doctor in October and she wanted to do an upper endoscopy (to rule out celiac) and a colonoscopy. After the endoscopy and colonoscopy my gastro dr said I most likely have Chrons, just waiting for biopsies to come back which they came back and identified rare H. Pylori organisms in my stomach. I spoke with a woman from the gastro dr office who told me at this time my dr doesn‚Äôt think I have Chrons.

Results from Upper endo, colonoscopy and biopsies: 
- Biopsy: active duodenitis with changes suggestive of peptic injury in the duodenal bulb
- localized moderate inflammation characterized by erythema, granularity and mucus was found in the duodenal bulb
- ÔªøÔªøbiopsy: moderately heavy gastritis, predominantly chronic in the stomach
- ÔªøÔªølocalized mild inflammation characterized by erythema was found in the gastric antrum
- ÔªøÔªøbiopsy: rare H. pylori organisms identified on IHC stain (stomach)Ôªø
- ÔªøÔªøpatchy inflammation, moderate in severity and characterized by erythema and aphthous ulcerations found in the terminal ileum
- ÔªøÔªøbiopsy: mild focal active ileitis in the terminal ileum (comment pic attached)
- ÔªøÔªøright and left colon tested negative for colitis

Comment for non-specific ileitis: I have not taken any NSAIDS in several years. 

I‚Äôm currently taking antibiotics for H. Pylori and have to wait another 4 weeks after to take a stool test and then will see what my gastro says. 

TLDR: I have been having urgent diarrhea for a few years, calprotectin 1570, negative for celiac, negative for ulcerative colitis. Found rare H. Pylori in my stomach. Gastro doctor thought I most likely had chrons after seeing my upper endoscopy and colonoscopy pictures, but now that they found H. Pylori in the biopsy she doesn‚Äôt think I have Chrons. 

Can I have both H. Pylori and Chrons? ",2,1732387346.0,IBD,1,1.0,False

It‚Äôs been expressed I‚Äôm not allowed to bring a date to this as I‚Äôm ‚Äúsingle‚Äù. I‚Äôm fine with that. Although I was married the last 3 times and didn‚Äôt bring a partner. 

This is the first time for me out / out in literally a year. (All our dates have been daytime coffee while little one at school, long telephone calls and generally butterflies both ways) 

We‚Äôd love to spend the night together. 

The Xmas party is available for him to just buy a ticket if we wanted to but he wouldn‚Äôt be with us as a work group.  Shitty date.
But, it would be awesome for us to have a night together at this stage, wake up together, breakfast, spa, pool, etc. 

Would it be out of order for him to appear at the party, after the meal to join me for the rest of the night? We both want this. ",1,1732387275.0,Soloparenting,0,1.0,False

There is a photograph showing St. Anthimos, a majestic archimandrite, holding a cross with which he blesses people. And there is a poor monk standing next to him. This is St. Nikephoros in the early years of his monastic life. His fingers are still there. His face is still like a face. Just a few years later the malady would disfigure this man, who had previously in Alexandria been a handsome young man.

[St. Anthimos \(right\) and St. Nikephoros \(left\)¬†¬†¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/18vpvhonro2e1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e6381f59b98f78ec6aa189f44b2823c9ea34793)

There is also a portrait that was recently discovered by Fr. Simon. It was painted during the saint‚Äôs monastic tonsure or a little later, because his face had become more elongated. This portrait is very important to me because I wanted an icon of St. Nikephoros to be painted, but not one that would recall the young, healthy and handsome youth from Alexandria, and not one with a face disfigured by leprosy.

I told our iconographer, Fr. Ambrosios, to paint an icon and I gave him a copy of the book about St. Nikephoros. This was before that photo was discovered, and we did not yet know about it. How beautifully the iconographer depicted this saint! But on the cover of Monk Simon‚Äôs book the skilled Athonite icon-painters just took the face of Nicholas from Alexandria and added a cassock and a beard to it.

Fr. Ambrosios wanted to depict the pain and asceticism on the face of a man who was transformed into Jesus Christ and ‚Äúchurched‚Äù this pain. And without any portrait to refer to, he painted an icon of St. Nikephoros. And later, when I saw this portrait, I was amazed. His eyes in particular surprised me. They are the same eyes that St. Nikephoros had in his earthly life.

The saint appeared to people, and they called me on the phone and told me that he had the very face depicted on the icon.

When an icon is painted with great pain and prayer, many significant elements are imprinted on it, even from the saint‚Äôs earthly life.

A few years ago my friend, a bishop, called me and said:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm having an operation tomorrow, and it‚Äôs going to be very complicated. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone about it. And since I trust you, I ask you to pray for me. And I ask you to pray to St. Nikephoros, whom you love and who was your spiritual father.‚Äù

I told him:

‚ÄúAll right, Your Eminence! Tomorrow I‚Äôll ‚Äòsend‚Äô St. Nikephoros to you!‚Äù

The next day I prayed in front of St. Nikephoros‚Äô icon, which is in my office, and told him simply, as Elder Iakovos (Tsalikis) used to teach us:

‚ÄúI beg you very much, Holy Nikephoros! This Vladyka from Crete comes from the same place as you. Go and support him during his operation tomorrow, hold the doctors‚Äô hands and direct them!‚Äù

That was all I said. Four or five days later Vladyka recovered after the operation. He called me and said:

‚ÄúThe doctors put me under general anesthesia, and throughout the operation I saw St. Nikephoros. And he did not look like the icon on the cover of the book, but from the one that was painted thanks to you.‚Äù

I said to myself:

‚ÄúHow humble the saints are!‚Äù

St. Nikephoros lived with St. Anthimos for forty-three years. In 1947 the anti-leprosy vaccine was discovered, leprosy no longer killed people, and many of them returned to their homes. But they were expelled from their native villages because of prejudice. Former lepers came to their homes only to find that their wives had married other men. There was a law according to which a leper automatically received a divorce certificate from his or her spouse. Leprosy was grounds for divorce. It was another pain. They related to me:

‚ÄúWe left our island and were kicked out of our homes. We went back to the hospital and said to ourselves: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to die here with the other lepers!‚Äô‚Äù

When a remedy for leprosy was found, Elder Evmenios was still Monk Sophronios. And what did he do? How did this man sanctify himself? Firstly, he stayed to take care of his Elder Nikephoros, because, as will be written later, St. Nikephoros had come to him in Egaleo. Secondly, he saw all the pain of the lepers‚Äînot only physical and mental pain, but also their rejection by society, so he said to himself:

‚ÄúAlthough I have been cured (he later became a priest, and he did not have a single scar left), I will remain in the leper colony to serve the lepers!‚Äù

You understand how great his sacrifice was! St. Evmenios sacrificed his life at the monastery‚Äîthat is, he sacrificed his choice, where, as a monk, he could have attended services, observed fasts and had a father-confessor. But he sacrificed everything to serve the lepers.

[Elder Evmenios. Agiosnikiforos.gr](https://preview.redd.it/ptwhdwxpro2e1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fb779f19e652fb67c9c82816d60f8a879ab7901)

In 1957, the leper colonies in Chios and Spinalonga were closed and all the lepers from all over Greece were gathered outside Egaleo, in an area called Agia Varvara. And what was built there was called an infectious diseases hospital, not a leper colony. Not only lepers were admitted there, but also all patients with infectious diseases.

Later AIDS broke out. Initially it caused people to panic. All HIV patients were sent to the infectious diseases hospital. We were students at the time, and took all this with a light sense of humor. We came to Elder Iakovos and told him:

‚ÄúThere is a new disease called AIDS.‚Äù

Elder Iakovos had a great sense of humor. And the next time I came to see him, he said:

‚ÄúListen, recently a man with the disease which you told me about came to me to confession.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith what disease?‚Äù I asked him.

‚ÄúWith this Eidzee.‚Äù

Later we realized that he had meant a person with AIDS.

Even more touching was Elder Evmenios, who suffered a lot of pain from leprosy. The first AIDS patients, desperate young people, were brought to him. Everyone came to Elder Evmenios, and he comforted and heartened young people who had the new disease. He didn‚Äôt know anything about it himself.

One day I arrived and found him making coffee for four young men with AIDS. I came to the kitchen to help him. He said:

‚ÄúMake some coffee, open some Fanta (his favorite drink), and take everything out of the fridge: cheese, olives, bread and pieces of dried bread from Crete, because my spiritual children are suffering from that new disease.‚Äù

At some point, when he was pouring coffee, I heard him say:

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough, my Christ! That‚Äôs enough, my Christ! May the people‚Äôs suffering end!‚Äù

That‚Äôs how this compassionate man pitied people with AIDS!

At the age of twenty-four he became a monk, but he did not have an elder. He celebrated services for five hours a day. The abbot of Dionysiou Monastery phoned me and said:

‚ÄúBrother Neophytos, your elder here is almost becoming a saint! He celebrates services on his own for five hours a day. We don‚Äôt even do that in large cenobitic monasteries on Mt. Athos!‚Äù

And the elder was alone. He prayed with prayer ropes alone in his cell. Until 1957, he prayed as he struggled on his own: ‚ÄúMy Christ, send me a man who will tell me whether I am in delusion or not!‚Äù Elder Evmenios saw angels, demons, and uncreated light.

Some monks would say to him:

‚ÄúYou are in spiritual delusion.‚Äù

Elder Evmenios prayed to God to send a man to his holy monastery. Christ answered his prayer and sent him St. Nikephoros, who brought him a letter from his elder, St. Anthimos, who, as far as I remember, wrote: ‚ÄúMy dear Father Sophronios, I am sending you a treasure to guide you in faith and prayer. Use this treasure, and you will become an experienced monk, like Father Nikephoros.‚Äù

Indeed, for seven years, from 1957 to 1964, Elder Evmenios was both the right and the left hand of St. Nikephoros. Why? The disease was progressing powerfully in St. Nikephoros‚Äîit had disfigured his legs, he could hardly move, had become totally blind, and his sweet voice was getting weak. A leper, a blind and semi-paralyzed man surely needed help. Elder Evmenios took care of him, putting his shoes and cassock on him so that he could go to service every day. St. Nikephoros was proficient in Byzantine singing, knew most of the psalms by heart, and remembered all the apostolic texts. With him Elder Evmenios learned monastic life.

[St. Nikephoros in the final years of his life. Agiosnikiforos.gr¬†¬†¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/39wx6au1so2e1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a12d60d6b4fd3b026af3ea58ad4ad77cd243ec9)

Yesterday I received an email from America. The correspondence of St. Anthimos with St. Nikephoros has been found. When St. Nikephoros went to the leper colony in Egaleo, the elder continued to correspond with him and wrote letters to him. These letters have been discovered. And I found St. Nikephoros‚Äô signature very beautiful‚Äîmost likely he dictated to Elder Evmenios, because I recognized the latter‚Äôs handwriting.

In 1959, St. Anthimos (Vayianos), the elder of St. Nikephoros, reposed in the Lord in Chios. He was known as a great saint, so the Ecumenical Patriarchate canonized him very quickly. His feast is celebrated on February 15/28. Later, St. Nikephoros was also canonized.

When we came to the leper colony, we saw that Elder Evmenios kept St. Nikephoros‚Äôs relics in a chest in the adjoining cell. With great simplicity he would tell me:

‚ÄúI keep our elder here!‚Äù

We went inside and opened the chest, which was made of iron. What a great fragrance came from the relics of the leper saint! This fragrance is especially mentioned in his troparion. How many people came to believe in the holiness of St. Nikephoros, not only after reading the book, but also while holding it in their hands and immediately sensing a fragrance!

This occurred to many. When Abbess Justina of St. Nicholas Convent in Orounda fell ill, I traveled to the nuns. Touched, they brought me a particle of the relics. Not only did was it fragrant, it also started exuding myrrh. Large drops of myrrh appeared on the surface. I told them:

‚ÄúSisters, don‚Äôt be afraid! St. Nikephoros is with us and will strengthen us!‚Äù

This year I visited the Peristeron nursing home again. By coincidence, it was on the feast of St. Nikephoros‚ÄîJanuary 4. We spoke with its director about the construction of a chapel. The nursing home bears the name of St. Anthony, and it would have been logical to dedicate the chapel should to him as well. But there is already an old chapel in Peristeron dedicated to St. Anthony. The director asked me:

‚ÄúWhich saint shall we dedicate it to?‚Äù

And someone in my soul told me:

‚ÄúTo St. Nikephoros.‚Äù

Then, when I got into the car, I asked the driver:

‚ÄúWhat date is it today?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is the feast of St. Nikephoros today.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/tplg116vro2e1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=e77506dba4d50879e2d1561517685ebd5a5ad7b9

Thus, by the grace of God, in our diocese we have almost completed the design of this house of God, and we will have a large chapel in Peristeron dedicated to St. Nikephoros the Leper for the needs of the elderly, as well as for the staff and all pilgrims who love this saint. Everyone in Cyprus loves him.

I was impressed by one fact that is absent from the Life of St. Nikephoros. In 1961, Elder Evmenios was visited by a proud thought, and an evil spirit began to possess him, making him think that he had become a saint. Later the elder got rid of this spirit. How important it is to have lowliness of mind! He felt what hell was like when he was possessed by an evil spirit, and therefore he was always on the look-out not to judge others or exalt himself. All this was taught to him by St. Nikephoros.

St. Nikephoros saw the spiritual realm very clearly, although physically he was almost blind. With through this vision he saw the tempter, who walked and put various sinful thoughts and lust into the minds of other Christians, patients, nurses or doctors. St. Nikephoros had such power over the evil spirits that he would call a demon and tell scold him:

‚ÄúScoundrel, why did you put an evil thought into one of the nurses? Lust into such-and-such a patient? Anger into such-and-such a person?‚Äù

And he forbade the evil one to come to them again:

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt the cross of illness enough for them? Isn‚Äôt their patience enough? And you come and tempt them! Don‚Äôt come to them anymore!‚Äù

He had such power. However, whenever one of his spiritual children was possessed by an evil spirit, St. Nikephoros would say (to prevent others from regarding him as a saint):

‚ÄúI‚Äôm unworthy. Take him to Crete, to Koutouma Monastery. Let Father Nicodemos read the special prayers over him.‚Äù

Here is another story. As a law student I went on pilgrimage to Holy Mount Athos. There was a celebration at the famous Serbian Hilandar Monastery there. After the Vigil we went to the refectory. I was sitting next to a monk who asked me:

‚ÄúAre you a Cypriot?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere do you live?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Athens.‚Äù

We started talking about who I went to confession to. It was Fr. Gervasios from Simonopetra Monastery, a very good monk who died young.

He asked me:

‚ÄúDo you go to the leper colony in Egaleo?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs Father Evmenios your father-confessor?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúFather Nikephoros lives there as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúFather Evmenios tells us many stories about him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI met him,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhen I was in Sunday school. Our teachers, who were members of church organizations, would take us to the leper colony in Egaleo to encourage and inspire the patients to Christian activity. And we went there and ‚Äògot our heads out of the clouds‚Äô! There in every ward we met joyful, praying people‚ÄîI saw it with my very eyes. They had small libraries with the Philokalia, the Evergetinos,^(1)¬†books by St. Isaac the Syrian, and the Lives of the Saints. Books that even theologians did not know about until later. The lepers read them. Who did they get them from? From St. Nikephoros, who received them from St. Anthimos and gave them to Elder Evmenios to read, and he passed them on to all the patients. This is how Holy Tradition works.

‚ÄúWe also went to sing them a Christian song, give them some sweets, and show them support; and in the end the lepers taught us a lesson in Orthodoxy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we came to Father Nikephoros, he asked us, ‚ÄòMy children, how do you pray?‚Äô We uttered a few emotional, impromptu little prayers out loud. And he said to us, ‚ÄòThat is not the way you should pray, my children! It is necessary to say the prayers, ‚ÄúLord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!‚Äù, ‚ÄúMost Holy Theotokos, save me!‚Äù, ‚ÄúRejoice, O Virgin Theotokos‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt is truly meet‚Ä¶‚Äù. But first of all you must have repentance, and then pray.‚Äô

[The monastery on the island of Chios. Agiosnikiforos.gr¬†¬†¬†¬†](https://preview.redd.it/0f1ruu0xro2e1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd4b64a7e290407518a277a423f0585716bda118)

‚ÄúNo one had ever told us what repentance is. We had never heard that there is the prayer of the heart, that there are prayer ropes, that there is the prayer ‚ÄòLord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me, a sinner!‚Äô We learned about this from a leper, the nearly blind and almost entirely paralyzed Father Nikephoros.‚Äù

We were able to make the most of the time we had because of that. After we left, and we were talking about going back, he complained that we were constantly on the go and rushing. That he wanted some down days. I agreed so long as he continued to get up, and leave, early in the day. Specifically during the first part of the trip because we had little time where we were going. He agreed to get up around 9:30am/10am at the latest and leave around 11am. I agreed, if he did that, to come back early so we could relax and watch things. And to have days where we mostly stay in. I also agreed to be more flexible with the time and not rush as much. I talked about how it would be nice to get up and have a coffee together on the porch at our Airbnb, opposed to leaving right away. I was skeptical he would uphold his agreement to wake up, and leave early, because he was sleeping in a lot before we came. 

He wasn't getting up to 2pm or 3pm unless he had to. He was also staying up late on his phone or gaming. However, he blamed his medication he's been on for months for it. When it's not known to cause tiredness nearly as much as the ones he was previously on. I know it can cause it to some extent but I also know, having witnessed it, he is able to get up and on little sleep if he has to. I expressed my doubts that he would get up and not sleep in because he was doing it at home. He said he wouldn't, that he wasn't in America, as if it was going to suddenly be different there. The first day that we got here we were both tired, and experiencing jetlag, and so I wasn't too bothered. I sat out and had a coffee with him on the porch for 30mins or so. The next day I tried to wake him at the agreed upon time and he wouldn't get up, and asked me to let him sleep longer. I got a bit upset as we don't have long here to do that every day. When he got up I still sat out with him and had a coffee. 

He continued to not want to get up on 8 to 9 hours of sleep. Every day I struggled to get him up and then he took ages to get ready. We left around the time I told him I didn't want to leave at or past it. As a result of that we were out quite late and he complained about that. I said that we would be able to get back earlier if we left earlier. I expressed my disappointment and he didn't seem to care. He said he would get up and leave earlier but I wasn't going to believe it until I saw him do it. For three days straight now he's said he will get up earlier, or not take as long to get ready and then hasn't done that. I have been getting upset having to beg him to get out of bed, complaning about how he's not upholding his agreement. Only for him to claim I am unreasonable for this, and that I am the one causing us to not get along. 

I've tried to be understanding and lenient. He asked to wake up a bit later two days in a row and I said okay, so long as he got ready within an hour or so. He gets up, lays in bed for nearly 20mins, and then takes longer than an hour to get ready. Today, I got upset over it again only for him to dismiss most of what I said. He pointed out that I also wasn't ready. Every single day I was ready before him and I think now there's no point. He said that I'm not upholding my agreement to get get back earlier. I asked how he could expect me to stick to my agreement if he's not sticking to his. He got frustrated with me and told me to shut up. This isn't the first time we've had this issue. A few other trips we've taken to America he's done this. I would get up and ready only to sit and wait on him. The last time we were he did albeit to a lesser extent. He complained about not getting back earlier then, as well, and I said we would if we left earlier. 

He's being less affectionate, as well, and is blaming the fact we are not getting along. When a large part of why we aren't getting along is him doing this. ",1,1732387110.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

- this will be a very long post, TLDR below with lab/test results

Background:
I have been having urgent diarrhea on and off for a couple years. It used to be just spicy food and coffee, then progressed to:
- Heavy fats (fried foods, heavy cream, if I have a lot of cheese) 
- Lettuce/leafy greens like spinach  (almost always will have diarrhea) 
- alcohol especially sparking and red wine
- non-alcoholic carbonation 
- If I have too much raw fruit
- Occasionally if I have a lot of pasta 

Now this year, it seems like no matter what I eat, I randomly get urgent diarrhea - with my stomach making very loud sounds, light cramping and I would have to rush to the bathroom often several times. Typically these bouts last for a few days to a week and randomly start again. 

I‚Äôm not that much a fan of doctors, but I was finally able to get my first appointment with my Naturopath in July. I explained all my symptoms to her and she had me do blood tests and two types of stool tests. She also had me start taking a teaspoon of glutamine everyday. Sometimes I thought it helped and then a whole week I had diarrhea while I was still taking it - think the glutamine helps with a little less urgency, but still have diarrhea. 

Tests came back and found nothing wrong with my thyroid, tested negative for celiac, no blood found in my stool, but my calprotectin was 1570. 

Saw my naturopath again and she said that I have active inflammation which would rule out IBS and said it‚Äôs probably Chrons, colitis, or an infection. (I also have a family history of IBD - my dad has ulcerative colitis and my maternal first cousin has Chrons - ileitis, paternal great grandfather had UC and another great grandmother had IBD (unsure what type) but she died of colon cancer).

Anyways, my naturopath suggested I see a gastroenterologist. Saw my gastro doctor in October and she wanted to do an upper endoscopy (to rule out celiac) and a colonoscopy. After the endoscopy and colonoscopy my gastro dr said I most likely have Chrons, just waiting for biopsies to come back which they came back and identified rare H. Pylori organisms in my stomach. I spoke with a woman from the gastro dr office who told me at this time my dr doesn‚Äôt think I have Chrons.

Results from Upper endo, colonoscopy and biopsies: 
- Biopsy: active duodenitis with changes suggestive of peptic injury in the duodenal bulb
- localized moderate inflammation characterized by erythema, granularity and mucus was found in the duodenal bulb
- ÔªøÔªøbiopsy: moderately heavy gastritis, predominantly chronic in the stomach
- ÔªøÔªølocalized mild inflammation characterized by erythema was found in the gastric antrum
- ÔªøÔªøbiopsy: rare H. pylori organisms identified on IHC stain (stomach)Ôªø
- ÔªøÔªøpatchy inflammation, moderate in severity and characterized by erythema and aphthous ulcerations found in the terminal ileum
- ÔªøÔªøbiopsy: mild focal active ileitis in the terminal ileum (comment pic attached)
- ÔªøÔªøright and left colon tested negative for colitis

Comment for non-specific ileitis: I have not taken any NSAIDS in several years. 

I‚Äôm currently taking antibiotics for H. Pylori and have to wait another 4 weeks after to take a stool test and then will see what my gastro says. 

TLDR: I have been having urgent diarrhea for a few years, calprotectin 1570, negative for celiac, negative for ulcerative colitis. Found rare H. Pylori in my stomach. Gastro doctor thought I most likely had chrons after seeing my upper endoscopy and colonoscopy pictures, but now that they found H. Pylori in the biopsy she doesn‚Äôt think I have Chrons.

Spruce and Juniper was really fun. Very well balanced with the spruce/juniper and the hops  and the flavors complimented each other well. I typically don't like IPAs with adjuncts so this was a pleasant surprise.

First Ride was solid. Malt flavor and coffee blended well together. Coffee flavor was maybe a bit more acidic than I wanted but it was solid and I'm going to have a tough time deciding what to buy next between this and All Out.

Got it home got it all cleaned up and was excited to make my first shot and this happened. I have little to no experience with espresso machines but did alot of research before attempting my first shot. I decided last night to remove the the filter in the machine above the Portafilter as it looked dirty. I removed that as well as the black plastic piece around it, cleaned and reassembled. I know the filter is tight bit it's possible that the black plastic piece wasn't super tight in case that matters. I prepped 14g of coffee beans and ground it as fine as my baratza encore was capable of, put the grounds into the double shot basket inside the portafilter popped it in and turned the machine on and it started leaking all around the portafilter. Then I removed the coffee and cleaned out the portafilter and put it back in as I thought it could be my grind? But it still leaked everywhere with no coffee grounds.  Did I do something wrong? Or did I get screwed on this buy? Maybe needs a new seal? The machine appears to work properly and looks brand new. The person I bought it from said they purchased it a year ago and maybe used it 10 times. Any help would be much appreciated. ",2,1732386766.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

The Diplomatic CEO (Sun in Libra)

Ah yes, the visionary leader. The one who can‚Äôt decide whether the office should focus on sales, innovation, or just making a really chic coffee bar in the corner. They call endless meetings to ‚Äúdiscuss,‚Äù but every decision is stalled by their obsession with ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs fair.‚Äù Honestly, the team would be more productive if a squirrel were in charge. But hey, at least the office plants are thriving under their careful scrutiny.
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find a compromise.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do nothing until everyone is magically happy.‚Äù

The Dramatic HR Manager (Moon in Leo)

This one is basically an extroverted cat in human form. They don‚Äôt manage HR; they are HR‚Äîa one-person theater troupe constantly performing for attention. Need emotional support? They‚Äôll talk to you for hours‚Ä¶ about their own feelings. And if you dare criticize their party-planning skills, expect a Shakespearean-level meltdown. They‚Äôre brilliant at lifting morale‚Äîuntil their mood plummets, and suddenly it‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhy does nobody appreciate me?!‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúWe need to celebrate this!‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúI need a standing ovation for organizing cupcakes.‚Äù

The Pragmatic COO (Capricorn Rising)

Ah, the office curmudgeon. Efficient? Yes. Inspiring? Absolutely not. They have the warmth of a spreadsheet and the emotional depth of an Excel formula. Their idea of a motivational speech is ‚ÄúBack to work.‚Äù They judge everyone silently, sipping their tea like the disappointment fairy. If you ask for feedback, they‚Äôll just stare at you like you‚Äôve personally offended their five-year plan.
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not realistic.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúI hate fun.‚Äù

The Investigative Analyst (Mercury in Scorpio)

Oh, they know all your secrets. This is the person you accidentally confessed your worst mistake to, and now you live in fear they‚Äôll casually bring it up in a meeting. They speak in ominous riddles, making you wonder if they‚Äôre here to analyse market trends or solve murders. They have spreadsheets more complex than the Rosetta Stone, but good luck getting them to explain anything without a suspiciously long pause.
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúInteresting. Very interesting.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúI know your browser history, Janet.‚Äù

The Cheerful Networker (Venus in Sagittarius)

This one‚Äôs probably ‚Äúworking remotely‚Äù from a hammock in Bali. They pop into Zoom calls with that carefree, globe-trotting energy, dropping gems like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think outside the box!‚Äù while the rest of the team silently prays for focus. Sure, they‚Äôre charming, but trying to pin them down for an actual task is like trying to catch a butterfly with chopsticks.
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all about the big picture.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúI have no idea what the details are.‚Äù

The Protective Office Manager (Mars in Cancer)

This one thinks they‚Äôre everyone‚Äôs mum, but they‚Äôre the overprotective kind who smothers you with kindness and passive-aggressive ‚Äúconcern.‚Äù They‚Äôll spend hours making sure the coffee machine is stocked but cry in the break room if you forget to say thank you. Also, why does every email they send feel like a guilt trip?
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúI just want to make sure everyone‚Äôs okay.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt anyone love me enough to empty the dishwasher?‚Äù

The Ethical Advisor (Jupiter in Libra)

Lovely person. Completely useless. They have the moral compass of a philosopher, which is great if you‚Äôre Socrates but not ideal for, you know, actually getting work done. They‚Äôll spend three hours crafting a company policy that ‚Äúrespects everyone‚Äôs rights,‚Äù then wonder why nothing‚Äôs been achieved. They‚Äôre like the office yoga instructor‚Äîcalm, balanced, and oblivious to deadlines.
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúWe need to think this through.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stall this until it resolves itself.‚Äù

The Innovative Compliance Officer (Saturn in Aquarius)

They‚Äôre like the IT person who tries to explain blockchain to you when all you wanted was the printer to work. They have visionary ideas but present them in the driest, most soul-crushing way imaginable. Sure, they‚Äôve ‚Äúrevolutionized‚Äù the filing system, but did they really need a 27-slide PowerPoint to tell us?
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúThis is the future.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too dumb to understand this.‚Äù

The Disruptive Innovator (Uranus in Capricorn)

Ah, the rebel with a clipboard. They‚Äôre always suggesting wild changes, like replacing the office chairs with bean bags or introducing mandatory VR headsets. Half their ideas are genius, and the other half are absolute chaos. When the boss rejects their 27th suggestion, they mutter darkly about ‚Äúcorporate sheep‚Äù and retreat to redesign their standing desk.
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúWhy do we do it this way?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúLet me dismantle everything you love.‚Äù

The Shadow Consultant (Lilith in Pisces)

This one drifts in and out of the office like a gothic ghost. They‚Äôre weirdly insightful but deliver their truths in the creepiest way possible‚Äîprobably while staring at you across a dimly lit meeting room. They‚Äôre amazing at spotting office politics but seem to thrive on the drama they uncover. Let‚Äôs be honest: they‚Äôre the one lighting a scented candle while whispering ‚ÄúLet chaos reign.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúThis feels‚Ä¶ off.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúI am the chaos.‚Äù

The Aspiring Explorer (North Node in Sagittarius)

The office dreamer who spends more time planning their backpacking trip than actually contributing to the team. They have a million ideas but follow through on exactly none of them. Their desk is covered in inspirational quotes and half-finished projects, but don‚Äôt expect them to finish anything before their next yoga retreat.
	‚Ä¢	Favourite phrase: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs expand our horizons!‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	What they really mean: ‚ÄúI need a sabbatical.‚Äù

Final Thoughts

Your workplace isn‚Äôt a team‚Äîit‚Äôs a sitcom waiting to happen.

Quotes:

""[...]

**You announced your Star Trek action figures at New York Comic Con, which also happened to be about a month before the Season 7 premiere of your hit series A Toy Store Near You. What was the reaction at NYCC, and have fans begun giving you ideas of the characters that they want to see in the future?**

>Brian Volk-Weiss: We've received well over 2,000 emails with ideas. It already affected Wave 1 in two ways. We were only going to do six figures in Wave 1. But one of the most common things we heard in those 2,000 emails was basically ""Go big or go home."" The fans, their biggest concern [was] that we would do six [figures] and be done.

.

>As soon as I read that, I went to Paramount right away and told them what we'd heard. I basically was like, I think we should do eight, maybe even 10. They, of course, immediately agreed. So that's number one. Number two, one of the most requested characters was Weyoun from Deep Space Nine -- and that is why Weyoun is in Wave 1.

**Fans now know who the characters are -- Weyoun, Captains Jellico and Garrett from The Next Generation, Tuvix from Voyager, Mirror Archer from Enterprise, Peter Preston from Star Trek II, Valkris from Star Trek III and Captain Sulu from Star Trek VI. But what comes with those figures? What are fans going to get beyond the characters?**

>I am a big accessory person. I love the G.I. Joe Classified line -- it's a great line no matter what, but the volume of accessories. We're going to do the same thing. Archer will come with an Enterprise phaser. He will come with an Original Series phaser. He will come with an Enterprise communicator. He will come with an Original Series communicator. He's coming with all the stuff you would expect. He's also going to come with this green bottle with two green cups, from one of the scenes with him and Hoshi.

.

>At the end of the episode [ ""In a Mirror, Darkly"" ], Hoshi poisons him via champagne, and he does something very peculiar. He clinks champagne glasses with her and then drinks a sip -- and then he's laying on his bed and he turns over, looks up and pours the champagne on his face. And then a minute later, he dies. We're going to come with that champagne glass, but not only that, there's going to be a thing to put in it, so it's like half full. And then there's going to be a thing to put in it so it's coming out and he can lay down and he can pour it on his own face.

.

>Rachel Garrett -- let's just say she comes with two heads, and then she also comes with a piece of debris that may or may not fit perfectly on her neck. But she will also come with a phaser. She will also come with a communicator. We include the accessories that should be there, but then put in some stuff that just says to the fans, hey, this company gets it.

.

>Peter Preston, he'll come with the mask that plugs into that nipple thing on his costume. He'll come with some other engineering stuff. He'll come with two heads, for obvious reasons. But what I also want to include [is], later in the movie, they show [Saavik] with this kind of bizarre tricorder that you never see again in all of Star Trek. Some people might say ""Well, we never saw him hold that,"" which is completely true. But you figure he's a Starfleet officer, he's in engineering. Maybe we'll make it a different color. But that's the kind of stuff we want to do.

**Another important feature that Nacelle is including is the articulation of each figure. What can people expect in terms of the technical specifications?**

>We're going to be comparable to Star Wars Black Series and G.I. Joe Classified, so it should be around 25 points of articulation. They're all going to be about seven inches, and they will go on sale Q1 of next year.

**Of the Wave 1 action figures, are there any that you're particularly excited about? It's momentous that you're doing a ""Yesterday's Enteprise"" figure with Captain Garrett, but who else resonated with you?**

>The two characters that were the inspiration for the entire line were Garrett and Jellico. Before we started making toys, I knew a lot of people that owned or worked at real toy companies. So I would constantly pitch them, you should do Star Trek... The examples that I always gave, I was always like, how has nobody done Rachel Garrett?

.

>If you look at every list of Next Generation, the two best episodes always alternate between ""The Inner Light"" and ""Yesterday's Enterprise."" We've had a million Picards [from ""The Inner Light""] with a million flutes. They never did Captain Garrett. They did Salamander Tom Paris from Voyager. They never did Jellico. It never made sense to me.

.

>If I can get a little cheesy for a scond, my wife is Taiwanese and we have three kids. Our daughter looks as white as me, but both of our sons look, I'd say 80% Asian, especially our older son. And I'll never forget when we were looking [at], I think it was a billboard for Andor. He goes, daddy, how come there's never any Asian people in Star Wars? I never forgot that he said that, ever. When we went from six figures to eight figures, I immediately knew I wanted to do Captain Sulu, partially for that reason.

.

>But the other reason is I've read George Takei's book; I know the story of how important it was to him as an actor to be seen as a captain and not just a navigator. It's a huge thing. They shot a scene in Wrath of Khan where they talk about him getting promoted to captain, but the scene was not used. I know it was incredibly important to George Takei that the opening scene of Star Trek VI [was] literally him in the center seat drinking his coffee. So those three [figures] were very important to me.

**Not just in terms of business, but as a die-hard Star Trek fan, what can you say about the long-term plan for Nacelle's Star Trek action figures?**

>My goal is to get to at least a hundred figures. That's getting to first base. That's not hitting a home run. I want to do at least a hundred figures.

.

>The other thing I want to stress [is that] we are absolutely, positively doing the big characters. I want to stress the word almost, but Wave 2 will almost guaranteed have a Kirk and a Picard. They will just be a Kirk that's never been made before and a Picard that's never been made before -- which is code for it won't come with a flute. [Laughs.] We are not only doing characters that were on screen for three minutes or one episode. We will, God willing, do a Data one day. And I know the Data I want to do. He's never been made before; it's from a very specific movie or TV show.

He's not dumb, but he was just yapping about everything, without even trying to get to know me. When we both headed home, he asked me to text him when I get to my house, which I did. We exchanged a couple of texts, then he sent me a shirtless pic at the clinic, so I complimented him, and he just replied ""thanks""...
So, I think it's safe to assume that he doesn't like me, and I should not embarrass myself by pursuing him anymore. I'm really asking on some advice on how to get over it, and maybe some emotional support. Thanks xx

Edit: he said he only would be interested in friendship. I'm pretty sad and disappointed...",2,1732386174.0,askgaybros,10,1.0,False

My newly discovered work around is to put last week's trays in while I drink coffee for an hour or two in the a.m..  Then I brush, floss, etc. and put the current week's trays in.  Ortho has me swapping out every week, so there isn't a huge difference, and it's a small amount of time and, and, and . . .  I need to not gulp my coffee!

Anyone else feel the struggle?

1gy63hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1gy63hk/chronic_diarrhea/,Chronic diarrhea,"Hi, I'm 25 years old man and I have been experiencing diarrhea every single day for a year and a half.

I have a history of gastrointestinal issues when I was a teenager. I did a colonoscopy at the time and they said everything was normal. They diagnosed me with IBS (are we surprised).

10 years later, my symptoms are just worse than ever. No matter what I eat, I get diarrhea. Sometimes it's slushy/ mushy like pilled mashed potatoes or like a puddle of mud and other times I get explosive diarrhea and it's completely watery. It can smell like nothing and other times the smell is awful. My symptoms are chronic diarrhea, trapped gas who make a lot of noise (which can occasionally be painful), pulses in my hypogastric region, nausea, fatigue, irritability, difficulty focusing, depression and anxiety, hives on my back, hair texture completely changed and they became super brittle and don't grow as fast and don't curl anymore. Another symptom is bloating. I usually get super bloated by the end of the day and back to normal the next morning. I've tried keto, Low FODMAP, lactose free, gluten free and NOTHING. I've tried psyllium husk (the powder form and pills as well) and the only difference I noticed is I get constipated when taking the pills. The psyllium powder mixed with the water tends to make the diarrhea worse somehow.

I don't really drink coffee and I believe I eat relatively healthy. My fridge and pantry looks like this : veggies (all kinds, I'm not a picky eater), fruits, sauerkraut, jasmine rice, quinoa, sweet and normal potatoes, sourdough bread, lean ground beef, chicken breast, salmon, sardines, eggs, lactose free greek yogourt, lactose free butter, olive oil, avocado oil, nuts and nut butter, chia seeds, hemp seeds, dark chocolate, tea. I don't drink alcohol, I don't drink juice and soda. I only drink tap water. I don't smoke.

This chronic diarrhea is impacting my quality of life to the point where I no longer enjoy living. My GP is convinced my diarrhea is caused by my anxiety but I KNOW for a fact that it is not. He prescribed me antidepressants (Sertraline and Wellbutrin) which made my diarrhea even worse. I was literally shitting water, I'm not kidding. I would go buy Pedialyte to hydrate myself after an episode just to shit it right after. Toilet was completely blue (blue raspberry Pedialyte). Note that I am not taking the medications anymore.

I got bloodwork done, nothing alarming. For tyroid, he tested my TSH only and that was normal. IgA test for celiac was normal as well. Did a stool test, no H-pylori, no E-coli and no salmonella. He wants to prescribe me Flagyl but I'm scared this will destroy my gut microbiome even more. I can't be the only one who thinks this is a bad idea to take antibiotics without even knowing the root cause.

Anyone went through a similar experience? Should I test for H-Pylori again? Should I ask for a complete celiac screening? A lactose intolerance test? Could it be SIBO or C-diff? Should I ask to get my Vit D, B-12 and Ferritin levels checked? Although I'm very lucky to have a family doctor, he's very passive. I feel like I'm the one doing most of the work. Some doctors don't know shit (no pun intended) about health. They just know about diseases and never seem to care to even dig deeper.

I know this is a long text and thank you if you made it this far. This is just a cry for help. I won't be able to go through this for much longer.",1,1732386055.0,CrohnsDisease,2,1.0,False

If you watched that episode, rajat clearly said he would make everything upaide down but he will never give coffee to someone (something like this). But just a few minutes later, he gave that coffee to vivian. As a viewer we have seen, he gave it willingly. He doesn‚Äôt even try anything. He was not true to his words. That was the thing Digvijay was pointing out. And Digvijay was 100% right as the saying goes fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. So obviously digvijay was cautious about this. 

Later Rajat returned that coffee, but Digvijay clairified it was never about the coffee. So please dont say just coffee ke liye, just coffee ke liye... 

Yes rajat has done things in favour for Digvijay. But so is Digvijay. If you watch splitsvilla, you know how great of a friend Digvijay can be. He literally carried his friend at finale weeks. When it comes to friendships, you will never find a better friend than Digvijay, may it be in bigg boss house or splitsvilla.

Recently, I tried the recipe Lance showed in his latest video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CafyJ2p0Bgs), and somehow this magically dampened the unpleasant sourness, leaving only mild acidity, and, god, it tasted good.
