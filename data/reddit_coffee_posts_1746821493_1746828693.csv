1kiuqee,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalDestination/comments/1kiuqee/final_destination_death_rankings_all/,FINAL DESTINATION DEATH RANKINGS - ALL,"In light of Bloodlines coming out, I along with many others have rewatched the series. I decided to do a ranking of all the deaths I saw and could count within the 5 movie series so far. I have some comments on some of them explaining my ranking. Let me know yours!

This is based on my own person opinion, but in forming my list I took these things into account, which I gave more or less weight to depending on the death:

1. Death Creativity;
2. How much of the death we see;
3. How painful that death would be if it happened IRL;
4. How scary the death looked; and
5. Impact on the movie

1kiuor5,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1kiuor5/starbucks/,Starbucks,"Teacher here, always near a local Starbucks.  I have to say how I’m so irritated at the new policies about not giving out water without a purchase!   I’ll have you know that although I don’t care for the beliefs and policies of the Starbucks company, I’ve always found myself heading over, making friends with the employees and giving them updates on our school schedules and such.  When school is out, I do not visit Starbucks  and instead go to Dutch where they know how to better support preferred customers.  

During the school year, I go to Starbucks multiple times a week.  I take my break there. Get away from campus to a calm place where there’s music and I won’t be tempted to work through breaks or lunch.  I buy something one average twice a week— drinks, breakfast, lunch.  Other days I was getting water, taking a potty break. Chillin for a few mins.  Go back to the grind.  

This “ no water” policy without purchase is BS.  complete and utter BS!  It’s a stupid thing to even complain about.   So now, I have figured how to still get my water for the week, but trust me, my actual business has only just increased to Dutch Bros, where daily, they go for it of their way, by policy, to make sure the prefer to choose them.   As I watch the increase in Starbucks commercials, trying to get butts in their stores while actually being told no and even receiving some annoyance from the newer employees, I can see why, beyond their belief’s, why people are choosing Starbucks less.  


Get it right.  Get right with your customers before you lose who you have left!    Seriously.  I see what’s happening in your stores and there are problems.  Notable that you have so many commercials running on my shows trying to get people back, while actually reminding em when I see them that I have enjoyed the friendly yessss at Dutch Bros much better.   

Treat your employees better.  Remove your politics. You’re a coffee house.  And treat the customers better.  ",0,1746828377.0,starbucks,1,0.25,False

1kiulp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1kiulp2/az_withholding_my_check/,AZ Withholding my check,"Location: Phoenix, Arizona 

I work a liaison job which is an outside marketing. 

I work as an outside sales liaison for a medical company, building relationships with accounts.

 I took two weeks off to bury my mom, and on the day I returned to the office, I was fired with the reason that they “couldn’t afford me.” 

Since then, my final paycheck has been withheld. Initially, they demanded a death certificate for my mom and a doctor’s note for a sick day, which I provided. 

Now, they claim via email that they’re auditing credit card receipts and will hold my paycheck until the audit is complete. I don’t recall signing any agreement allowing them to deduct charges from my wages or withhold my check for this reason, and I’ve asked them to send any such agreement, but they haven’t provided it.

The company uses HubSpot, a CRM database for tracking client interactions, but I only logged accounts about half the time. My boss frequently reprimanded me for not logging consistently, as I disliked it. They’re now cross-referencing my credit card charges (for lunches, treats for accounts, and similar expenses) with my HubSpot entries, which will show discrepancies since I didn’t always log. 

However, these charges were business expenses for client relations, (lunches, treats, coffees) not personal, and HubSpot isn’t a financial tracking tool. My boss’s knowledge of my inconsistent logging undermines their claim that unlogged charges are personal.

Four and a half hours ago, I emailed them, stating that Arizona law (A.R.S. § 23-353) prohibits withholding my final paycheck and that any deductions require a signed agreement, which I don’t recall. I’ve received no response. I have all emails for reference.I’m at a loss because I urgently need this paycheck. It feels like they hold all the power, and I’m unsure how to proceed.",1,1746828146.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False
1kiulmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1kiulmk/fringe_hours/,Fringe Hours,"Hello 👋🤗 
I never thought I'd be the one to give advice here! I am usually the lurker who needs it. 

Anyhow, I read an amazing book last week I got called in for Jury Duty in my city and I got picked to be on a case. Well I was there ALL DAY. I had my phone charged the first day, playing Pokemon on an emulator app, and I read most of a book I wasn't thrilled with. I'm actually surprised how fast I read it. 

The second and third day? I picked up a different book that I forgot all about. I'm not an avid reader like I once was. I still collect books when people give them away. I cant help but buy a book for a bargain...and they usually sit.  I wasn't sure how fast id go with reading or if I would like it still.I think I got the book I'm about to mention at Ollie's like five years ago.

It's called, ""Fringe Hours"". The book is written by a Christian Wife and Mom Jessica N. Turner, and is actually bearable despite the religious undertones. Basically the argument is that we bite off too much to chew, and this leaves us with no time for our passions and self care. The author explains about being a wife and mom and how hectic life is. How she thinks she has to say yes to everything and have the perfect house, and kids and all that.I am a guy and still found the book very relatable. 

The author talks about, ""Fringe Hours"". These little pockets of time where we can be productive. For example, when the author goes to the doctors and is early she will pull a book out or complete a task in those few minutes of spare time. 

She also talks about saying no. Completely not what I was expecting. She argues that we have to learn to say no so that we don't burn ourselves out.

She even talks about social media. The author states that social media is not healthy because social media is basically the new ""keeping up with the Joneses"" type platform. None of it is real. However we often use other people's life as a metric for our own. She advises to keep that to a minimum. 

The author states that it's A Okay to ask for help. Which is something I need to do more of! I live with my brother and I'm constantly cleaning up after both of us. I feel so overwhelmed because I have made this solely my responsibility. Why lol? I took her advice and I asked my brother for help. I told him I couldn't do it all, and that it's overwhelming. He had no fuss or complaining and he's been helping out more. 

The book is all about making time for yourself. 

My fringe hours are in the morning. I've started waking up before everyone in my house. I mean I do already wake up early, but I usually doom scroll.

I like to have time to myself and I can get organized and do so much between 6-9 AM. I could wake up at 7, or even 8 if I had a late night. 

This has me cleaning as I go, and I've forced myself to make a habit of cleaning up the dishes before I go to bed. It makes walking up so much easier. Once in a while I'll leave em for the morning and that's fine too! I have build in time for that! 

It's so much easier to just rinse a pot right away even if I just put it in the sink. The food I cooked is not going to be ice cold if I do that lol, it's fine. And clean up? Well it's easy because nothing is sticking to the pan or pot! 

I've always developed a couple systems that make life easier. 

The biggest thing to start me was to pick an area or room every time I am off to deep clean. I get everything in that area organized and cleaned. 
After doing that, I know where everything is. Mise en place is how I call it. Everything in it's place. 

What I mean is, I'm not struggling to wash coffee cups or hunt for stuff, because I know where it is. This saves me a lot of time. 

I used to be someone who would wait until it's time to go to work to find my keys. Even though I was almost ready, I'd be almost LATE from looking for the keys! So now I have a hook I put the keys on and that time is reclaimed.

It might be hard at first if you are really messy or been avoiding a room / area. You might not want to wake up early because your body is used to waking up later in the day. I promise if you give it a chance, it works?! ",1,1746828139.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

He used the wood to make vegetable beds and after we took the shed apart it revealed the septic tank below. When we moved in 3 years ago we wanted to reroute our plumbing to the main and get rid of the septic tank, but it took much longer than we anticipated. 

Soon we discovered there was a crack in the tank causing thousands of mosquitos to hatch in the grey murky water! It didn't take long to realize we had a horrible mosquito infestation, and had to sleep with a mosquito net over our bed which was a challenge with 4 cats!  

It wasn’t an easy transformation, and once we finally had it removed digging out the massive pieces of concrete out kicked my butt! 

I wanted to grow a gorgeous rose garden with colors inspired by a sunset. When the sun rises in the morning and lights up the garden we could enjoy it when we opened up the shutters in the morning, or when we sat out in the nook having coffee.

Since purchasing the lathe, I’ve made an assortment of rings on my lathe from blue and red opal, to coffee grounds and epoxy resin. 

I wanted to post these rings for a couple reasons. The first being to get opinions on how I did making these rings. The second, to get an idea of what I should sell these for. I’ve had a few people say they would like them and to give them a price, but I’m not certain I know what a fair price would be. For context, I have about $50-$70 in materials and roughly 2-3 hours of labor in them a piece. 

I would like to make a decent profit on each ring, so I can invest that money back into different tooling as well as better tooling.

1kiuhdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1kiuhdc/yajuj_and_majujgogmagog_my_research_long_read/,YAJUJ AND MAJUJ(Gog&Magog): My research. Long read.,"In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful.

I decided to finalize the results of my research on Gog and Magog, which took place over the past week, and to describe my conclusions in detail.

One day, I recalled a topic I had returned to from time to time over the past several years — Gog and Magog.  
Suddenly, I felt the urge to finally figure it out: in which direction of the world was Dhul-Qarnayn located when he built the wall?  
To be honest, this thought had never truly left me — it kept resurfacing in my mind, as if demanding an answer.  
And each time, I became more and more convinced: it was about the North.

I opened an AI assistant and asked a simple question: what was known about Gog and Magog — before Islam?  
At that moment, I had no idea how deep a rabbit hole I was about to dive into.

Unexpectedly, the AI presented me with information about a book titled *The Romance of Alexander*, which I had never heard of before.  
Moreover, it turned out that this text was written in antiquity — even before our era.  
That stunned me.

I thought — interesting.  
I thought so because, deep down, I understood: I would never have stumbled upon this book on my own.  
It’s simply never mentioned. Not in school curricula, not in popular sources.  
And yet — this is ancient information that can literally be read today.  
Even if it’s “just a romance,” it predates Shakespeare.  
Which means it can offer a glimpse into the life, consciousness, and worldview of people from that time — from the inside, in the first person.

I decided: fine, I’ll download the audiobook and listen to it on the go.  
At the time, I didn’t yet know how terrifying the picture I would see would be — and how deeply it would shake me.  
Perhaps I learned too much, too fast.

I’ve always considered myself a rational person: I don’t believe in conspiracy theories, I’m not fascinated by stories about the Bermuda Triangle or anything of that sort.  
But when I reached the end of my search, I was truly overcome by fear.  
Because it became clear: someone in this world clearly doesn’t want us to know about this.  
Even though the information is accessible — it’s buried under thick layers of distortion, omission, and outright censorship.  
Yes, censorship — something I didn’t even notice at first.

When I started searching for the audiobook *The Romance of Alexander* in online stores, I was surprised to find that it simply wasn’t there.  
And yet I was sure that such an ancient literary monument should be widely available.  
Alright, I thought, maybe at least a regular printed book in Russian?  
But again — nothing.  
Or rather, I found a Soviet edition from the 1950s.  
I opened it, ran a keyword search — not a single mention of Gog and Magog.  
No surprise, I thought. It’s the Soviet Union — they traditionally censored everything related to religion.  
(Though… if you think it’s all “fairy tales,” why censor it at all?..)

So I started looking for an English version. It wasn’t available in online stores either.  
But in a digital archive, I finally found a scanned edition from the 1890s. This one did mention Gog and Magog — with descriptions that were grim and specific.  
However, it wasn’t the “original,” because, as I found out, the original text of the romance was lost more than a thousand years ago.  
All we have today is a mosaic of fragments: translations, adaptations, additions, and distortions scattered across different cultures, eras, and languages.  
A complete, “pure” original does not exist.

What I was reading was a Christian version, rewritten by monks more than a thousand years ago. And even in that version, there are already mentions of the monstrous rituals of the people of Gog and Magog:  
— cannibalism,  
— boiling a baby in its mother’s womb,  
— dissolving a child’s body in a vessel of water,  
— washing weapons in that solution.  
It was a short but shocking fragment.  
I decided to keep digging.

I found another English version, but there was nothing about Gog and Magog in it.  
Still, the picture was beginning to shift. Gog and Magog were no longer just a mythical people or an allegory — they were emerging as a clearer depiction of an ancient people whose culture was built on absolute, ritualized violence.

Various footnotes and comments in the text tried to reassure me:  
“It’s an allegory… It’s hyperbole… It’s just a metaphor…”  
But honestly, those explanations no longer worked.

I decided to return to the Qur’an — a source I fully trust.  
It clearly states that Gog and Magog are a people who spread corruption on the earth and were sealed behind a barrier by Dhul-Qarnayn (i.e., Alexander the Great).  
At first, it sounds simple: “They spread corruption” — well, many nations in history have done that. The history of mankind is a succession of wars and death.  
But gradually, a different thought began to creep in:  
What if this isn’t just about violence?

What if we’re not talking about a regular nation that used violence as a means — but one for whom violence was the end?  
What if it was a pure cult of disorder, a rejection of the very idea of humanity?

And that’s when I began to wonder:  
If Gog and Magog are mentioned in the Qur’an, and if they also appear in ancient sources, in Judaism, and in Christianity…  
What about other cultures?

And this is where it got truly interesting.

In ancient Indian tradition, there are descriptions of seven underground realms, known as *Patala-loka*.  
The deepest of them — *Patala* — is inhabited by Nagas, Asuras, and *Kalakeyas* — demonic beings devoid of light and compassion.

📖 *The Mahabharata*, *Bhagavata Purana*, and other texts describe them explicitly:  
• Kalakeyas — sealed underground;  
• they feed on flesh;  
• they dwell in total darkness;  
• and they await the end of the Kali Yuga to break free and enslave humanity.

In *Udyoga Parva* (Mahabharata), it says:

>

❗️These texts do not use the words “Gog and Magog,”  
but everything in the description — is them.  
Just under another name. 

In another religion,  
in another era.

**North and South America —**  
**The Hopi (Southwest USA, Arizona)**  
• The Hopi tell of ancient people who went underground after a great catastrophe.  
• In parts of the oral tradition passed down by tribal elders, it is said that these ""First Ones"" still live deep beneath the earth — and they are in the North.  
• It is believed that under certain conditions, they may come out.

This isn’t a direct tale of violence, but it’s a structural anxiety.  
The Hopi, like many ancient peoples, don’t divide “good/evil” as in the Abrahamic traditions. They speak in terms of **disharmony** — a disruption of cosmic balance.  
But essentially, those who were sealed beneath the earth for violating sacred law — and whose return marks the end of the world — are strikingly close to the image of Gog and Magog, just viewed through a different mythological lens.

Gradually, a picture begins to form:  
There were specific peoples, living in the North, for whom **extreme violence and destruction** were not deviations — but the foundation of culture.

Across all traditions, they are described as **sealed away — but not destroyed**.  
And what is astounding: they still exist with us on this planet, right now.

If we suppose that people who followed a **cult of violence** were truly sealed underground —  
what has become of their society after thousands of years in isolation?

Once, they were merely aggressive — cannibals who worshipped pain.  
But after 3,000 years of complete subterranean isolation, their culture has become a civilization of total psychosis.  
Individuality has vanished.  
Only ritual, function, and hatred remain.  
Violence is law.  
Language is a scream of pain.  
Reproduction — a tool of survival.  
They know no love, no affection, no good.  
Empathy to them is a disease.  
Compassion — a reason for murder.

Every generation of these people grew in darkness, fed on fear, remembering only one legend:  
**“Above live those who sealed us in. They fear us.**  
**We will rise — and destroy them.”**

Over thousands of years, this didn’t just become a belief — it became a **religion**.  
Their civilization is **biomass saturated with rage**, no longer wishing to coexist with humanity.  
It seeks to erase the very concept of ""human.""

The ritual of baking an infant is not a sacrifice — it is the **destruction of the idea of birth itself**.  
They have no sacred beginning: motherhood, family, childhood — all are seen as shameful, weak, human.  
Baking is an **inverse act** in which birth is not sanctified, but obliterated before all.  
It is followed by the **dissolution of the body in water** — so even the form disappears, leaving no name, image, or trace.  
Then comes the **washing of blades in this slurry** — sacred weapons are cleansed of all humanity.  
Each sword becomes part of a ritual — not just a killing tool, but a **carrier of the ancient will to deny life itself**.

In the end, they ceased to be a people. They have become a weapon of historical rage.  
They are beings shaped by pain and disgust for humankind.  
Their goal is not to conquer, but to erase the memory of humanity.  
**“If we suffered for 3,000 years — then you will vanish forever.”**

What this tells us:  
Gog and Magog possess an **anti-culture**, where:  
• life is not a value  
• motherhood is weakness  
• mercy is shame  
• strength comes only through pain, flesh, and ritual violence  
• they lack empathy — not because they are ""evil,""  
but because they were raised in a **reversed value system**

**Why is no one talking about this?**  
Because the modern mind doesn’t know where to place it:  
• It doesn’t fit within the scientific paradigm.  
• It’s too close to truth to be dismissed as a mere fable — yet too terrifying to be believed literally.  
• It shakes the confidence that we know everything about human history.  
• It challenges the core illusion of the modern world:  
→ **“All evil is behind us. Hell is impossible. Humanity is safe.”**

When in fact:  
**Hell is right beside us, on the same planet, here and now.**

It seems that humanity — by the will of God — really did **lock something away**.  
Not metaphorically. Not symbolically.  
**Literally.**  
And… forgot.  
Or chose to forget.

We are not dealing with myth as fable.  
We are dealing with **the deep memory of humankind** — About something that hides in our collective history — something all cultures tried to record  
in whatever form they could,  
while the revelations speak of it openly,  
yet modern clerics reduce it to mere metaphor.

And now, if you’ve read this far, let’s return to the most important question:  
**“Why has** ***The Romance of Alexander*** **— one of the oldest and most widely circulated texts of the Middle Ages — vanished from public discourse?”**  
**“Why are the chapters about Gog and Magog either cut out or distorted?”**

Because it was **deliberately erased**.  
And here’s how it happened:

**1. Targeted “editing” in the Early Modern period**  
Already in the 16th–18th centuries, European editors began to:  
• “Cleanse” the romance of “fantastic elements”  
• Remove Islamic, Jewish, and Coptic fragments  
• Replace names, burn alternative versions  
The sections most heavily “cleansed” were precisely those describing the **imprisonment of nations behind the wall**, **rituals**, and **prophecies**.

**2. Soviet and secular editions completely removed the chapters on Gog and Magog**  
• In the Russian edition from the 1950s, the fragment about Yajuj and Majuj is simply **absent**.  
• The reason?

>

⚠️ And people stopped knowing that one of humanity’s oldest legends had been quietly cut out.

**3. Full versions have survived ONLY in manuscripts** —  
in Arabic, Armenian, Syriac, Coptic, and Georgian variants.  
But they are:  
• not published  
• not digitized  
• not translated into modern languages

• scattered across monasteries, libraries, private collections, and narrow academic circles.  
Some exist only as scanned copies of ""dirty"" manuscripts.

**4. The term** ***“romance”*** **is a trap**  
When you hear *“The Romance of Alexander”*, you think: *“Ah, a fairytale.”*  
But in reality, it was:  
• a global “bestseller” in over 24 languages  
• a source of inspiration for mapmakers, theologians, and geopolitics  
• one of the rare texts in which multiple religions described a shared prophecy — the arrival of horror from beyond

This doesn’t speak of fantasy — it speaks of a **deliberate Modern-era consensus** to suppress the subject.

But just think about it:  
One of the **most widely read texts of the entire Middle Ages** —  
*The Romance of Alexander* — was circulated from **Iceland to Sudan**, from **England to India**.  
It exists in **Greek, Arabic, Persian, Armenian, Georgian, Coptic, Latin, Old French, Slavic**, and more.

And then, in the Modern era:  
• ✂️ Chapters about Alexander’s Wall are removed  
• ✂️ Scenes of cannibalism, rituals, and end-times prophecies are cut out  
• 🕳️ There are **no modern editions** with a complete translation of these fragments

📌 And do you know what they *did* preserve — even romanticized?  
– The military campaigns, the marriage, the elephants, the philosophical dialogues.

**Why?**  
Because this part — the one about **Gog and Magog**, the **Wall**, the **rituals**, the **apocalypse** —  
is **too real**, too deep, and aligns too closely with other ancient prophecies.

🛑 It **shatters** the illusion of a “rational world”  
🛑 It **undermines** the false sense of control

🛑 And most importantly — it reminds us that **Evil was not defeated.** It’s just behind the wall.

📖 What survives in these trimmed, faded, scanned remnants  
are shards of a **glass coffin**, where the memory of ancient horror sleeps.

**Truth is never erased by accident.**  
It is obscured **out of necessity**.

And with *The Romance of Alexander*, we’re not just dealing with texts —  
but with fragments of collective memory,  
where too much aligns, too much is revealed,  
and too much threatens the established order.

That’s why it was done deliberately:  
Because the **coincidences were too precise**.  
Because this text **erases the boundaries between religions**.  
It unites Islamic, Christian, Jewish, and Eastern imagery  
into one **shared story of the Sealed Ones**.

Because it **activates an archetype of fear** that **cannot be controlled**.  
This is not fear that can be managed.  
This is a **challenge to the very structure of the world**.

This part wasn’t cut out because it was “implausible.”  
It was cut out because it was **too plausible**.  
Mentions of them lie at the **center of eschatology in all religions**.

People might have sensed that this wasn’t legend.  
It was a **warning**.  
Not a catastrophe.  
Not an accident.  
But **personal retribution** from those we have forgotten —  
but who have not forgotten us.

It is **living evil**, right here on the same planet as us,  
that doesn’t just want to kill —  
it wants to **erase, melt, and dissolve** anyone who dares to call themselves “human.”  
It is a **coming individual execution** for nearly every living soul at the moment of their return.  
**No one will stop the primal rage of hundreds of billions.**

Yes — based on Islamic eschatology and hadiths about the **drained lake**, among others —  
calculations suggest we’re talking about **hundreds of billions**.

When the truth arrives, **everything will collapse** —  
media, markets, hierarchies.

• Imagine CNN broadcasting crowds pouring from the mountains  
• Twitter flooded with: “This is not fake — they’re eating us”  
• The UN begging to seal the northern front, but no one knows how

Everything we believed to be solid —  
will **turn to paper**.

And finally:  
According to tradition, Caliph al-Wathiq once had a dream — that the wall of Dhul-Qarnayn, the barrier holding back Yajuj and Majuj, had collapsed, and the end of the world was near.  
Shaken, he ordered an expedition to the edge of the world to check the condition of the wall.  
The men who returned assured him that it was intact — though it is likely they found nothing and were simply too afraid to tell the truth.

This episode clearly shows how deeply the fear of these sealed nations was rooted in the consciousness of the people at that time —  
a fear so immense that even a dream about them was taken as a harbinger of the end.

📌 **Why this isn’t spoken about openly — even if it’s all true:**

**1. Because the system doesn’t know how to deal with unmanageable fear**  
Most modern institutions operate through **manageable anxiety**.  
They know how to handle war, pandemics, inflation —  
→ because they know how to show it, treat it, sell it, interpret it.

But **Gog and Magog** are a threat that cannot be sold.  
Cannot be interpreted.  
Cannot be neutralized.

📌 So only one option remains — **pretend it doesn’t exist**.

Because **acknowledging ≠ protecting**.  
**Acknowledging = panic.**  
The moment you publicly say:  
**“There may be a race living on this planet, sealed away and built on a cult of destruction,”**  
you must also admit — **no one knows what to do about it.**

→ The military? Useless.  
→ Diplomacy? Impossible.  
→ Nuclear weapons? Insufficient.

📌 **You cannot give people fear without a solution.**

Because such truth **undermines legitimacy**:  
• Clerics can’t explain why they were silent.  
• Science can’t explain why it denied the obvious overlaps between myth and fact.

• Bureaucracy: it cannot admit that it doesn’t control the boundaries of reality.  
📌 The truth about **Gog and Magog** is not just about fear —  
it is a **cascading collapse of trust in everything**.

They have been portrayed with claws, with fangs, with inhuman faces.  
On medieval maps, they appear as monsters, as beasts.  
But all of that is a **mask**.  
They are terrifying not because they are “not human” —  
but because they **are** human.  
Living, real human beings in whom everything human has burned away to ash.  
There is nothing more dangerous than a human being who has lost **mercy**, **memory**, **attachment**, **compassion**.

**Gog and Magog are not aliens. Not demons.**  
They are **us — in inversion**.  
If you turn humanity inside out —  
where light becomes darkness,  
love becomes hatred,  
forgiveness becomes an oath of vengeance —  
**that** is what truly terrifies.

We live our lives not knowing that **beneath our feet lies the cradle of fury**.  
We sip coffee, scroll likes, launch rockets —  
while **ancient hatred stirs beneath us**,  
sealed not in legend —  
but in stone.

**Remember:**  
The Qur’an does not mention “Mahdi.”  
The Qur’an does not mention Dajjal.  
**But Gog and Magog — are mentioned.**  
Not as a metaphor.  
Not as a symbol.  
But as **a reality**, whose emergence is **inevitable**.

And when they emerge,  
it won’t be a political crisis.  
It will be the **resetting of history**,  
or a **purification** before the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven,  
in which **Isa (peace be upon him)** will lead those who endure — by the will of the Almighty.

All of this **could** be dismissed as fantasy.  
One could flood it with questions:  
How could hundreds of billions of people be sealed underground?  
What kind of unique natural formation could contain them?  
Where is the evidence? Where’s the logic?

One **could** do that —  
**if not for one thing**:  
I did not invent anything new.  
I only tried to gather and analyze the **mosaic**  
that already lies at the heart of the faith of the majority of humanity —

**Muslims, Christians, and Jews.**  
And for all of them, it is not a hypothesis —  
but a truth taken **a priori**.

Because, as stated in the Qur’an:  
**“When Allah wills something — He only says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is.”** *(Surah Ya-Sin, 36:82)*

And at that moment, it no longer matters  
whether modern science has confirmed it —  
the very science that time and again revises its own boundaries  
after each new discovery.

I asked him what's wrong in being a feminist? Without any explanation he just says ""as a straight man you're a feminist?"" I didn't want to esclate the situation so I just said yes and changed the subject. 

I could have stood up in front of 5 of my friends and explained them the situation but I am sure they would have laughed at me and brushed it off as jokes.

Me (F21), my boyfriend (M27). 

Two days ago he had to attend a school information event. It takes him in total around 2 hours to come from **place A** (residence) to **place B** (main trainstation) **to place C** (final destination). Since he doesn't have a car, he asked one woman from his class that does, but lives in his area, to give him a lift, which would be absolutely understandable for me, but she wasn't able to, reason unknown. So train it is.
-
**Classmate** from a train ride, let's call her **Sarah **(F in her twenties? True age unknown) She's going to same class with him but usually sits in front of him, next to her girl friend. She is in a relationship, however he doesn't know anything about him, his age, duration of their relationship, nothing, as he says.
-
What he said: They don't text anything personal or private, only school related things, homeworks, etc, nothing else. He doesn't know much about her. 
-
Main story: His only option ended up being taking a train, which wasn't his first time doing so. He already went to the same place twice with a train, however he had to sleep at the hotel, since it was late at night. However, that day, Sarah hit him up so they go together. He would have to wait for her at the mainstation, or she for him, so they can continue together and spend the 1h30min ride together. And so it was. There, she asked him to buy her a Starbucks coffee, and so that happened, how do I know?..

.. he didn't tell me anything about him going with her to the school event, I only found that out once we somehow started talking about Starbucks and he mentioned buying a coffee for a classmate, so I started asking questions. 

*Why did I get mad?*

It's only because he specifically waited for her at the trainstation, which is super weird for me. It's a huge trainstation and a long boring destination spent with a woman he claims to not even know so well and only talk about school stuff. Just the thought of him waiting there, meeting her, getting her a coffee, then sitting together in the train, you get what I mean? I told him to try and picture it himself and he gets it, it sounds pretty bad. Now first, I assumed she was hitting on him, which I'm not even sure myself, I'm kinda confused about this whole situation. He said it's just really only professional and nothing bad about it, and I believe him now. 


What do you think? Was she hitting on him? Is this weird or am I overreacting? I'm not a jealous person, I never had a problem with him having closed friendships with women, I even want him to meet my close friend because they are both similar and he doesn't have many friends, so why not. It's just this specific situation, the way it played out and me not knowing about it is what drives. me. crazy! ",0,1746827167.0,AITAH,12,0.33,False

### **The American Pope**     

---  

### **Chapter One: The Smoke That Did Not Rise**

*April 1903 – Rome*

The marble corridors of the Apostolic Palace had never been so silent. Not even during war. Not even during plague. Silence had a sound here—it pressed inward, as if the walls themselves had entered a state of watchful prayer.

**Pope Leo XIII had died five days ago.**
Not in bed.
Not surrounded by cardinals.
But **in the Papal Gardens**, face-down in the reflecting pool of the Grotto of Saints, with soil beneath his fingernails and wax in his mouth.

The official story would be “exhaustion.”
But unofficially?

Unholy panic.

---

**Reginald Ashcroft**, dressed in the papal tailor’s finest forgery and bearing a red-stamped document granting him fictitious access to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, adjusted his collar and whispered into the hollow of his pocket watch:

> “London. The Fisherman’s Ring has not been removed. Repeat: it is still on the body. Someone is stalling the succession.”

In London, Lord Glasse crushed a sugar cube and muttered, “Dear God. The ring’s still hot. That means the Conclave hasn’t even *started*.”

“Correct,” came Ashcroft’s voice. “And worse—there’s talk of an American candidate.”

There was a pause.

Then: “Deploy the League.”

---

**Elsewhere in the Vatican**

In the reliquary vault beneath **St. John Lateran**, a man with a false name and a real crucifix tattooed along his spine flipped open a ledger bound in human skin. **Brother Cadenza**, the Jesuit archivist, was not officially alive. His death had been declared in 1897 by decree of the Black Index—the Vatican’s hidden order of doctrinal silencers.

Which made his current actions doubly dangerous.

He was reading the **Borgia Accord**, a document kept in myth and rumor, said to authorize papal assassination *in times of doctrinal emergency*.

The wax seal on the document had been broken. Not by him.

Brother Cadenza whispered the name beneath the signature aloud.

“Adrian.”

Then he burned the page.

---

**At the Café del Consiglio**, outside Vatican walls, a soft bell chimed above the entrance. A young woman—**Zhao Fei-lian**, wearing a mantilla and mourning black—entered, carrying a copy of *La Civiltà Cattolica* folded just so. She sat. A waiter brought espresso without asking. She unfolded the paper and found what she expected:

A microdot glimmering inside the ink of the obituaries.

She scraped it off with her thumbnail and whispered, “Stroud better be here soon. I’m not decoding Latin alone again.”

As if summoned by irreverence, **Cal Stroud** crashed into the chair opposite her.

“Didn’t have time to knock. Three bishops are tailin’ me, and I think one of ‘em’s got a sabre hidden in a parasol.”

Zhao didn’t blink. “How ecclesiastical.”

They both leaned in as the microdot flared faint blue in the café’s candlelight.

---

**Inside the Basilica, behind the high altar**, smoke billowed from an open vent—**but not from the Sistine Chapel chimney**.

It wasn’t election smoke.

It was **signal smoke**—a coded flare from the steam-fueled confession system rigged beneath the Vatican catacombs. The sort of system that hadn’t been used since the *War of the Two Johns*, when two popes sat on opposite ends of Italy and tried to excommunicate each other via semaphore.

The message was brief.
It pulsed three times. Then one. Then six.

Brother Cadenza paled.

“That’s not just a warning,” he said aloud. “That’s a resurrection code.”

---  

## **Chapter Two: The American Pope**

*May 1903 – Vatican City, Conclave Eve*

The cardinals were already sequestered behind marble and murmurs.

Their slippers whispered on the mosaic floor of the **Sala Regia**. Their eyes darted more than they blinked. And none had noticed the peculiar fact that the conclave had been delayed *exactly thirty-three hours*—the length of Christ’s earthly ministry, in years.

Inside the Conclave Hall, under Michelangelo’s Last Judgment, **Reginald Ashcroft** stood disguised as **Monsignor Pembroke**, British liaison to the College of Cardinals (deceased). The real Pembroke was presently asleep in a Trastevere wine cellar. Ashcroft ensured the man had rosé and Scripture.

At Ashcroft’s side, **Cal Stroud**, masquerading as a rogue bishop from the Oklahoma territory, leaned against a marble column, chewing blessed gum and glancing at the Sistine ceiling.

“Y’ever think this whole operation’s just a real high-budget séance?”

Ashcroft didn’t answer. He was busy reading the facial cues of **Cardinal Lorenzo della Scala**, a man whose expression hadn’t changed since the Franco-Prussian War. Lorenzo stood beside the papabile frontrunner—**Cardinal Neumann**, of Boston. American. Young. Charismatic. Suspiciously fluent in four ancient dialects.

Too clean. Too modern. Too *prepared*.

---

**Below the Vatican**, Zhao Fei-lian and Sora Hoshino were tracking a trail of *scented ash*—the kind used in encoded incense. It had been wafted not through cathedrals but *through the old pipe organs*, where notes carried embedded messages.

The message, once reconstructed, formed a single sentence in Gregorian solfège:

**“Adrian shall reign over the old and the new.”**

Sora tapped her mantis automaton, who clicked back: “Apocryphal. Possibly predictive. Definitely heretical.”

Zhao frowned. “Or prophetic.”

They rounded a corner and found it—**The Papal Resonator**.

A forbidden chamber beneath the Confessio, long rumored in Masonic dispatches. It contained **a mechanized throne**, copper-piped and candle-ringed, linked to a choir of automata, all tuned to recite *encyclicals never written.*

In the throne sat… **Adrian**.

He was not elected.

He had *emerged*.

---

**Flashback – 1897, Boston**

A nameless seminarian in the Jesuit underground—trained in counter-intelligence, memory encryption, and **the unsanctioned rites of Saint Longinus**—had vanished. No burial. No eulogy. Only a sealed document sent to Rome with a blood sigil.

His handlers called him *“the Concordant.”*

His mission? To outmaneuver secular espionage and infiltrate all future theological warfare.

The boy who would become **Adrian VII** was not chosen by the cardinals. He was chosen by **a dead branch of the Church**—one that believed the next Pope must not be voted on, but *engineered*.

---  

## **Chapter Three: The Keys of Saint Peter**

*Conclave Night – Sistine Chapel*

The white smoke rose.

The name was read aloud.
*Adrian. Adrianus Septimus.*
A murmur swept through Rome like a plague.

Ashcroft and Cal made for the exits—only to be met by **Swiss Guards with eyes glassy and hands too steady**. Automata? No. Worse.

They were *hybrids*—pilgrims fitted with electro-mechanical augmentations, programmed to defend Adrian’s claim with holy precision.

A fight broke out beneath the Judgment. Ashcroft cut a guard’s cruciform cable with a blessed razor. Cal pistol-whipped a bishop quoting Revelation in Morse.

Zhao burst in, flanked by Sora and Brother Cadenza, who held the last unsanctioned copy of the **Borgia Accord**, rewritten in invisible ink to include one clause:

> *“No Pope shall reign who has not wept.”*

Cadenza stepped forward. “Adrian VII. Do you weep for the soul of the Church?”

Adrian stared at him, eyes flickering.

“Why would I?” he said. “I was made to preserve it.”

That was enough.

Cadenza triggered the failsafe built into the Papal Resonator. The organ wailed. The automata shorted. Adrian collapsed—his mind overloaded by centuries of encoded doctrine, all poured in at once.

He did not die. But his memory reset.

---

**Epilogue – A Letter from Lord Glasse**

> *To the League:*

> *Adrian has been publicly recalled to “private health restoration.” A new conclave shall quietly reelect a more palatable Pope—one who believes in forgiveness and forgetfulness.*

> *As for the Resonator—it has been sealed. Again. May it remain myth.*

> *Rome thanks you. But does not know it.*

> *—Glasse*

Ashcroft folded the letter and lit it with a match.

Cal raised a toast in Turkish coffee.
Zhao smiled faintly, placing the burned corner of the Borgia Accord into a reliquary.
Sora muttered, “Don’t ask me to unplug a Pope again.”

And so ended the brief, forgotten reign of **the engineered pontiff**.

The world turned. The bells tolled.
And far below, in the dark veins of the Vatican, *something else began to stir*.

Designed as a 4-cup steam-powered espresso machine, this little powerhouse promises rich, full-bodied espresso for those seeking an affordable introduction to brewing cafe-style beverages. After testing it rigorously, I've developed a love-hate relationship with this device. Here’s my full breakdown based on weeks of pulling shots, frothing milk, and some inevitable spills along the way.

**Build Quality and Design**

Its compact footprint is a definite advantage for smaller kitchens like mine. Measuring roughly 11.4 x 9.4 x 7.2 inches and weighing just 3.65 pounds, it's easy to move around, clean, and store when needed. The black plastic finish gives it a slightly dated appearance—it wouldn’t win any beauty contests—but it still manages to look good enough on my countertop. The reusable filter caught my attention for both its eco-friendliness and cost savings over time. Yet, while the design is utilitarian, I noticed some plastic parts felt a bit flimsy. Nine months in, cracking or melting, as some reviewers noted, may become an issue.

[Check Krups FND111 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b005zxwvrm/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**

This espresso machine won’t deliver barista-grade espresso with crema, but that’s hardly its intent. The machine uses steam pressure for extraction, and the end result is a strong, satisfying brew. I’d liken it to a step up from drip coffee, with a more robust flavor. Since I stick to dark roasts like Bustelo espresso grind, the machine extracts bold, rich flavors fairly well. However, the lack of crema highlighted the device’s limitations—it doesn't match up to more expensive pump espresso machines in that respect.

**Milk Frothing Capabilities**

The built-in milk frother was a key reason I wanted to test this model. Frothing while the espresso brews? Indeed, a nifty feature on paper. I will say that frothing worked decently—I managed to add a velvety foam to my cappuccinos. However, you can't expect high-end results; steam quality and frothing consistency left room for improvement. If you’re envisioning the perfectly micro-textured milk you’d find in a coffee shop, this won’t make the cut. Especially without the “Perfect Froth” attachment, hitting just the right milk texture relies on trial and error.

**Ease of Use**

Overall, the semi-automatic setup was both a relief and a challenge. Setting it up was smooth, as was loading coffee and starting the brewing process. The learning curve came in managing the knobs and steam without causing spills—tiny design flaws made usage slightly cumbersome. If you’re patient and stay attentive during brewing, it performs as promised. Beginners may need a handful of attempts to nail the right proportions.

**Perks**

- Compact and lightweight design fits most kitchen countertops.
- Reusable filter eliminates the need for disposable coffee pods.
- Allows simultaneous milk frothing and espresso brewing.
- Produces a satisfying strong coffee that’s an upgrade from standard drip makers.

**Downsides**

- Plastic components may not withstand long-term heat exposure.
- No crema production, which some espresso aficionados might find disappointing.
- Frothing capability could be stronger, often delivering inconsistent results.

**Competing Products**

I also played around with a few competitors like the DeLonghi Stilosa manual espresso machine and the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista. The DeLonghi device, while pricier, brought out a significantly better crema layer and had sturdier build quality. Mr. Coffee’s automatic milk frothing system outperformed Krups in delivering consistent, fluffy milk foam. However, the Krups FND111 beats both in terms of simplicity, size, and affordability. Its casual, no-frills nature makes it a good match for occasional espresso and cappuccino lovers.

**Bang for the Buck**

Evaluating the pricing of this model compared to premium machines, I feel it's a worthy budget-friendly option, especially for beginners or occasional drinkers. High-end machines easily cost multiple times more, and for someone like me—just looking for an entry into home espresso—it gets the job done reasonably well. Still, those aiming for a step closer to coffee shop quality may want to stretch their budget for something more robust.

Greetings.

Lately, I've been playing a lot of hostage maps, and I'm somewhat disappointed that this mode seems to receive less attention than bomb defusal maps. From a gameplay perspective, these maps are really engaging, and I'd love to see them updated periodically. Perhaps we could have a dedicated section (similar to Premier Mode) featuring 5+ hostage maps?

Remember classic maps like Workout and Militia? It would be great to bring them back into rotation or even give them a refresh.

Hybrid Map Idea:  
What if we had maps with dual objectives (bomb + hostages)?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

She built America. In her timeline witches run the army and Sarah Alder is the General. Think of her as the female version of George Washington.

As stoic, strict, and gruff as she can be she has a sense of humor and has an appreciation for life. She can be goofy with the right people

She loves coffee, books, whiskey, and may begin dabbling in some unhealthy habits. (a little too much whiskey and women) to cope. with her long life and loneliness. She also paints, plays piano, loves the outdoors, gardening, motorcycles and did | mention coffee?
Working with the Fosterlings, the army's orphaned children brings her a great amount of joy. 

Her youth is in part to her Biddies. Women who dedicated their lives to Sarah in order to keep her alive. She was basically enslaved by the early US government and bound through
an agreement over a piece of land to which she was taken advantage over.

Alder's one true weakness is Tally Craven, however my character has the pov, it's not in the cards for her to be happy. She's always a little lonely and sad.

This is where you come in. I'm looking for a writer to eventually build a relationship between Tally and Sarah. 

If you want to write another character in this verse or an oc, come on over and let's brainstorm. 

All tropes are welcome. 

Enemies to lovers
Strangers, friends, lovers 
Angst 
Fluff 
Fantasy
Human and witch fall in love 
Time period pieces

Throw an idea at me
Our writing doesn't only have to take place in the world previously created. I love au's and would welcome modern time writing for her. She can be written without being a witch.

I'm detailed, literate, and prefer paragraph writing. No one liner responses unless it's banter for simple fun. I love world building, researching for stories, using gifs, custom commissions, and aesthetics to add depth to a story. I tag those I write with to develop chemistry and hope you're all right with doing the same. 

21+ For adult themes and references to alcohol. I don't expect you to reply every single day. I do enjoy ooc chat for plotting, ""fangirling"" and headcanons. 


I'm CST time zone. I do work a full time job and am intermittently available during the day to write replies or answer messages. 

My platform of choice is Facebook due to allowing groups and organization of ideas and posting pictures in albums. 

Want more info send let's chat and create.

1kitxb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1kitxb7/rfu_vs_cusm/,RFU vs CUSM,"I'm extremely undecided on which school I should choose for this coming fall and I really need help... I visited both schools and will include both my personal thoughts and objective points in the pros/cons but really need more insight anyone else can give me. Also, for background, I'm a CA resident who's never lived in a small town setting before, and I'm worried about lifestyle factors affecting me, but ultimately want to consider the school's rep/prestige and academic/match success factors equally if not more. Thank you!!

# RFU

**Pros:**

* Fully Accredited/Established
* Good Match Rate - 97% for 2025, 98% for 2024
* A few people in 2025 matched into CA (UCLA, USC, Loma Linda etc)
* Optional Class Attendance for Preclinical - (extremely good pro for me because I study best during the afternoon when I'm not burdened by attending classes I don't necessarily need to go to)
* Slightly Cheaper Tuition (\~74k/year)
* Pass/Fail for Preclinicals
* Building has a cafeteria
* Ranked on US News (#83 for primary care)

**Cons:**

* Location: I was excited to go to school in ""Chicago"" but quickly realized RFU is actually located an hour away from the city and is instead in a suburban area with nothing but residential streets around. It very much gave midwestern town vibes and I've always lived in a main urban city so it's a little worrisome, especially since the campus itself has nowhere to walk around so I'm scared that living here might be a little depressing (unless I decide to commute from the city maybe?) I've seen some comments from RFU students saying that food options also suck and I don't want to live unhealthily bc I'm assuming cooking will probably not always be an option. Lastly, I've never lived anywhere that snows.
* Campus: Campus was extremely disappointing. It was just one large building with a single cafeteria and no coffee shops etc. It also had no outdoor spaces for students and I need an outdoor escape when I'm stressed. However, I feel like maybe I can adapt to this and just walk around if need be and drive to the city when I absolutely feel like I have to?
* No teaching hospital = far drives for rotations? I am \*horrible\* at waking up early so this is scaring me but perhaps survivable?
* Not considered one of the best med schools?

# CUSM:

**Pros:**

* Location: Closer to home (about 1.5-2 hour drive), in my home-state, warm weather, closer distance makes me feel less anxious about starting with no physical social support system
* Pass/Fail Grading for Preclinicals
* Dual Rotation System: Rotations are split in half so you go through the same rotation blocks twice and thus have a better chance for LORs and doing better once you've already experienced it the first time.
* New School = newer building, amenities, etc
* 100% Match rate for 2025, many matches in CA
* Spanish classes give me an edge for residency apps
* Outdoor area in the sun for students

**Cons:**

* Provisional Accreditation (not probational, so I can still get federal loans but still...) and new school so unsure about reputation/prestige
* Not ranked
* Campus: Again, one main building in an area that doesn't have much going on. No cafeteria or coffee shop etc, just one snack room with like 2 vending machines. The smallest gym I've ever seen in my entire life
* Mandatory classes (except for a few flipped lectures but one of the admin made a side-comment saying this is probably going to change soon and become required as well)
* Mandatory Spanish OSCEs (I don't know any spanish and I've heard these can be rough for students)
* Slightly Higher Tuition (\~80k)
* No campus housing at all

Looking for something real, no rush, no pressure. Whether it becomes a relationship or a solid friendship, I’m all for deep connections built on trust and presence. Real talk, good vibes, and meaningful moments.

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life’s intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There’s magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you’re into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I’m also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I’m looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn’t mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you’re someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

If something here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one random thing that made today a little brighter for you.

1kitrvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kitrvg/how_to_adjust_the_range_of_a_grinder/,How to adjust the range of a grinder?,"I opened up and cleaned my Gaggia MDF grinder because I had to replace a broken spring.

Now I'm reassembling it and I realise I can adjust the range of coarseness the machine can provide.
The machine offers 34 steps to adjust the distance between the grinding discs (it's a burr grinder) with an interval of 25 microns.

So if I set the finest step to the minimum which avoids the discs to touch each other I'll have about 25 microns gap, and 34 steps up I'll have about 850 microns at the other extreme, as the coarsest setting.
I think there's no point in having it set this fine.

Based on https://misceliamo.coffee/alla-ricerca-della-granulometria-perfetta-2/ which states 300-400 microns I guess it's the maximum grain size, also based on https://www.microtrac.it/it/applicazioni/coffee-powder/ ) I think I could better use a range of 200 microns for the finest setting, which will give me 1050 microns for the coarsest setting. Espresso will then be obtained with a setting of about 4-8 and drop coffee at the very max.
This seems to match the manual of this grinder, stating that espresso should require a setting in the range 2-10.

1kitqcg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kitqcg,Cascahuín Blanco Mezcla Mate x La Matera review,"One more review before we head into the weekend. This one is from Cascahuín and is a special edition for the Argentinian restaurant in Guadalajara called “La Matera”. In Argentina, mate is an extremely popular drink. In a way, it’s similar to drinking coffee or tea in some cultures. But the idea of combining mate with tequila is something completely unheard of as far as I know. My understanding is that this is exactly what Cascahuín did here, in some way, infused the tequila with mate. Immediately that raises all kinds of questions I’m afraid I simply cannot answer but let’s at least delve into the resulting bottle.

**Brand(s):**  
La Matatera is a restaurant focused on high-end Argentinian food located in Guadalajara. Cascahuín is well-known by most people in the tequila world and are especially famous for limited edition runs and collaborations which can be exciting for some people who love the brand but vexing for others who see their releases as too broad and too costly to pursue. Undeniably though, the brand produces some of the highest quality, additive free tequila at varying price points and with wide-spread availability. In short, a person could enjoy it when they want it and a cult-like follower can spend years trying to track down elusive limited run bottles like Cerro de Luz and 11 Brix and never ever see one. Unfortunately for me, I fall into the second group.

**Specs:**  
NOM 1123  
750 ML  
38 ABV (74-proof)  
Blanco (I’m going to say “infused” with mate but I’m not 100% sure this is the correct technical term here)

  
**Process:**  
Cascahuín is additive free, they use stone/brick ovens for the most part and either roller mill or tahona wheel along with deep well water, they use stainless steel tanks for fermentation, double distill it in stainless-steel pots then copper pots and fermentation typically is without fibers, and is often fermented open-air. Beyond that, I have no idea what they did here and especially how they got the mate into it.

**Look:**  
This is extremely similar to the Tahona Blanco bottle but is accented with red instead of blue and features the “LA MATER.A.” logo with the number 25 on the top right corner which I imagine probably is a 25th anniversary celebration branded bottle.  Where the Tahona bottle typically would say “Tahona”, there are the words “MEZCLA MATE” (“Mate mix”).  There’s also a small mate gourd with a straw which is traditionally used to drink mate discretely positioned toward the bottom. The liquid is clear and typical for a Cascahuin blanco.

**Nose:**  
The nose on this is subtle, sweet, cooked agave, minerality, grassiness, herbal, citrusy and a hint of a flavor that I am not familiar with which I have to assume is the mate (I’ve only had it many years ago and don’t really recall what it tastes like.) It’s a pleasure fragrance that all seems to be very balanced and playful on the nose.

**Mouth:**  
Cooked agave, sweet citrus (lime, mandarin, grapefruit on the backend), minerality (wet stone), nuttiness, finely ground white or black pepper notes, grass, and that same unfamiliar mate flavor that is foreign to my mouth, maybe it’s the herbal plant-like note. After some research I think what I’m tasting is like a very soft tobacco flavor (very agreeable, not like a cigar or cigarette, just warm and tasty but also vegetal).

**Finish:**  
This drops off on a short to mid-length finish with more of that soft tobacco vegetal flavor I’m assuming is the mate, that buttery nutty flavor I always get with Cascahuín and that is so present in the Tahona blanco. A warm sweetness from the cooked and maybe raw agave maybe a hint of grass, cinnamon and mint as it trails off. Just really soft and enjoyable and relaxing.

**Price:** 2500 MXN (\~125 USD)  
**TMM Rating:** (none)  
**Our personal ratings:** 89

I first saw this bottle in a Facebook story from Chava of Cascahuín and posting about it a few months ago. I was later contacted by someone who had a bottle and was willing to part with it here in Mexico so I was happy to get it and I’ve been saving it since then.

I am a huge Cascahuín fan and I love supporting them. Not only because they make some of the world’s best tequila, but also because they are innovative and artistic with their bottle designs and collaborations.

This is one of the most unique bottles I’ve seen from them in terms of concept and style. Metallic red is not a common color you see on tequila bottle design and I’m very much influenced by solid design work.

For me, the mate is a curiosity here. I really enjoyed the flavor. It’s a unexpected combination that feels like an exotic cousin to the Tahona blanco that is so beloved. I can’t help but think I’m missing 2 things here. 1. I’m not Argentinean and didn’t grow up drinking mate; and 2. I think this was created with the restaurant in mind and likely should be paired with world-famous Argentinian food. I think the softer profile here would pair really nicely with chorizo or steak. My goal now is to visit the restaurant in a couple of weeks and enjoy some of their food to better understand the pairing. Thanks for reading!",5,1746825776.0,tequila,0,1.0,False

You sit down, blink twice, and suddenly it's 4:00 PM, your to-do list looks untouched, and you're wondering if you even ate lunch. Agent, you're not alone - we've all been there. It's not that we're lazy. In this business, time doesn't slip away... it sprints. So let's talk about how to manage it, before it takes you.

1. Start Your Day With a 30-Minute Game Plan. Before you open your inbox or answer that ""quick"" call, stop.  Could you write down your top 3 priorities, block time on your calendar, and decide what success looks like today?

2. Batch Your Tasks, don't jump between calls, quoting, marketing, and CRM updates every 15 minutes. Block time for each type of work so you stay focused and mentally in the zone. Examples:

* Client calls = 10 am–12 pm
* Lead follow-up = 2 pm–3 pm
* Marketing & social = Tuesday mornings
* Admin = Fridays (or delegate it if you can)

# 3. Use Tools to Save Your Sanity

CRMs, automations, templates - they exist for a reason.

* Schedule call reminders
* Use prewritten email responses
* Automate appointment setting
* Stop rewriting the exact text 4 times a day

You don’t get bonus points for doing it the hard way.

# 4. Guard Your Time Like It’s Money (Because It Is)

Learn to say:

>

Time vampires are real, and they’ll drain your day without blinking.

# 5. Breathe, Rest, Reset

A burnt-out agent writes sloppy business, misses follow-ups, and forgets callbacks.

Take breaks.  
Take a walk.  
Take 10 minutes for coffee *before* the flood of calls starts.

# Bottom Line:

You can’t control the chaos, but you can control your calendar.

So Agent…

1kitnh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kitnh0/how_im_healing_after_the_one/,How I’m Healing After “The One”,"I’m a woman in my mid-forties, and on May 2nd, I was dumped by the man I thought was the love of my life, for reasons even he isn’t sure of—‘I need to be alone.’ 

We loved deeply. Consistently. We were admired by everyone around us. We made it look “easy.” We were a beacon of hope for the hopeful romantics, that even at this age, you’re still worthy of genuine love. 

The loss has felt unbearable—like someone pulled the future right out from under me. I’ve been struggling with the silence, the confusion, the ache of being left behind by someone who once said and did all the right things.

But I also know healing isn’t passive. It’s a choice we make every single day.

So I wrote this journal entry from my future self. Not as a fantasy, but as an act of hope. A soft vision of what love could feel like—when it’s right, when it’s steady, when it stays.

If you’re hurting too, I invite you to do the same. Write the future. Remind your heart that the story doesn’t end here. ♥️

Journal Entry – 2 May 2027
A Day With My One
A quiet vision for the love that stays.

Woke up before my alarm—he was already making coffee.
Not just for himself.
For me.
He knows I don’t drink it, but he still brews the decaf with a little cinnamon because I love the smell.
When I came downstairs, my protein shake was already made. He’d even stuck a note on it:
“Fuel up, beautiful. You’re lifting heavy today.”

We sat on the back porch in silence for a while—the kind that doesn’t itch.
I leaned my head on his shoulder.
He kissed the crown of mine.
Neither of us needed to say anything—his presence was enough.

Later, we went for a motorcycle ride.
He followed behind me for most of it.
He says he loves watching me ride—loves the way I move like I belong there.
When we stopped for gas, he pulled up next to me and said,
“I’m proud of you, you know. For all of it.”
And I knew exactly what he meant.

Lunch was at that little Mediterranean place I’d mentioned in passing three weeks ago.
He remembered.
He always does.

At home, I was working on a story draft, and he brought me water without interrupting.
Then he sat down across from me, quietly working on something of his own.
We didn’t talk, but it felt like a conversation anyway.
We just… fit.

Dinner was simple. We cooked together.
He chopped, I stirred.
We danced a little in the kitchen. He’s terrible at it.
But he tries because he knows it makes me laugh.
And he loves making me laugh.

We ended the night in bed, legs tangled.
He traced the scar on my shoulder and said it’s his favorite part—
because it reminds him that I’ve survived everything that came before him.

He didn’t fix me.
He didn’t save me.

He just loved me right.
And that made all the difference.

Starting two weeks prior I stopped taking my prescriptions and allergy pills. I began taking Juven two weeks prior twice a day and additional Iron supplement 28mg one a day in the morning. At 5 days prior I took the heal fast pre op pills. Directions say 4 pills twice a day for 5 days I took them an hour after my regular morning pills and in the evening sometime between 6pm and 9pm.

Pre Op Diet:
Due to previous bariatric surgery I don’t eat bread really maybe a stolen bite once in a white from my son lol. I do eat like one large spoon fuIl of rice or one small corn or flour tortilla sometimes but carbs make me very full very fast so it’s not as satisfying as it use to be. I switched my diet to only fish and chicken breast for meats and went from 60-70 grams protein per day to 80-100 grams protein per day. I typically have a protein shake for breakfast i love the Chike protein however spice I also stopped caffeine I had bought their decaf latte one I usually drink the sweet cream. I’m excited to switch back to that one. I also bought a new protien powder that also has 10mg of collagen called Flavcity. A month before surgery I got their trial pack. My favorites were Brownie Batter, Butter Coffee, and Berries and cream. I will buy the Butter coffee in the future cause it does contain caffeine so I only have the other two at the moment their trial pack comes with 5 flavors those three along with chocolate peanut butter (which I think tastes more like peanut butter) and vanilla cream. Honestly they were all good I may switch it up and put them in my rotation with Chike. If you’re curious and have not tried Chike my all time favorites are sweet cream and triple espresso. In the winter time the have white chocolate pepper mint and I always stock up. They have seasonal ones that come around each year which is fun but they have a bunch of flavors. I’ll add links at the end.

For post op diet the recommended no uncooked seafood or shellfish for 1 month. (😭 sushi is literally a staple in my weekly meals it’s basically its own food group lol.) But I can still east cooked fish so that’s great.

Exercise:
lol I’m not a cardio girl but I do walk quite a bit on the regular each day plus I have a bunch of stars around my house so I consider that my cardio 🤭.
I go the gym 3-5 days a week and just focus on stretching and weight training. For a month prior I focused and light weights high reps to stretches my core muscles.

Pre op shower:
This was recommended by my bariatric team so I just did exactly what did for that surgery.
The night before when I was getting ready for bed. Showered like regular and made sure to shave everything except my head. Full shave of the lady bits, back, legs, arms, under arms. Even if you are not doing anything to your arms I would still shave because removing the tape from IV or anything else can hurt so bad if you have hair there. I also made sure my hair was extra clean cause I won’t be able to wash it by myself for a while. So first wash was a cleansing shampoo, second was regular shampoo, regular conditioner, deep conditioner. After the shower I used a little bit of my hair oil just on the ends and brushed it through before doing two french braids.

You could also get waxed but my bariatric team said not to wax if your not an avid waxer because you don’t know how your skin will react.

After my normal shower and full shave I washed all areas even my lady bits with Hibiclens (it’s a surgical soap) I washed every area twice and at least approximately 5 inches past where I thought they would make any incision.


The morning of surgery:
When I woke up the next morning I washed again with Hibiclens twice and then air dried before putting on what I would wear after being discharged from the hospital. I chose a full button down long black dress, a cozy long black cardigan, an extra long thin scarf (it can get cold in the hospitals), knee length compression socks (they gave me a different pair for the surgery), my black adidas slip on slides.

What I packed for the hospital:
* 2 adult diapers
* Ab board
* Back board
* Lipo foam pads
* Doughnut bbl pillow (this came in so handy because of all the things I got done together I actually used it right away since I could only be on the back.
* AirPods
* Cell phone
* Travel charger
* Phone charging cord
* ID
* Form of payment
* 1 large water bottle
* Tooth brush
* Travel size tooth paste
* Tooth picks (just a few)
* Hand lotion 
* Chapstick
* Eye drops
* Travel size Hand sanitizer
* Travel size cleenex

Day 0:
Drs and staff here are super nice and very professions I met with everyone the day before except Dr. Colon I met him the morning of.

I’ll use a 1-10 scale for pain

Woke up feeling pretty good considering everything I had done. I will say pain has been between a 3-6 mostly it’s my boobs upper sides and my butt. I brought the don’t pillow with me and that helped my butt a lot. I can’t get up at all because of the VP so I have compression socks and leg massagers which is super nice.
Eating and drinking fine not terribly hungry mostly just ate the meat from a sandwich they gave me I’ll try the soup later but I’m so thirsty.


Day 1:
Morning- Pain is a little higher I would say between 4-7 now. My compression socks are getting uncomfortable. Still more of a dull ache rather than sharp pain in upper abdominal area and under breast. So pain in arms or legs. Not often but a quick sharp pain in V-area not terrible I would say a 3-4 like a light sewing needle poke. For some reason my right side near my ribs right under my breast area has a similar sharp pain which is a slightly larger area that sharper pain lasts a few minutes.
Early afternoon- nurses helped me with a sponge bath, put on the faja, and walk. I’m cleared to go home for sure there is more pain on my right side under breath like a throbbing pain now. Checking out in a few hours.
End of day one, my abs hurt a lot, like a dull roaring pain, my left breast has a sharp pain and I’m super swollen everywhere. The nurses at my recovery house are amazing and the food is so good even though I can only eat small portions. Random small itches that of course I can’t reach are annoying lol still no pain in the lady bits area. And no issue using the restroom. I bought those disposable standing restroom helper which has been a life saver. Getting up not so bad but getting back down sucks.

Side note even with all the swelling the results are amazing. I’m so impressed it’s exactly what I had hoped for. Dr. Marquez (Dr. Guadalajara) and Dr. Colon (the gynecologist) literally did the most amazing job and made me feel so comfortable. I feel so blessed.

Overall I would say that of course the combo sucks but the things I thought would be the worst are not at all bad and the things I never considered hurt like crazy for instance right side of my right boob lol.

1kitfi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ipav9/comments/1kitfi4/from_collector_to_creator_i_built_a_collectibles/,"From Collector to Creator: I Built a Collectibles Manager App for Funko Pop, TCG, and LEGO Enthusiasts Like Me","Hi fellow collectors 👋

After years in software development, working across a wide range of technologies, I finally decided to merge my profession with my passion — collecting Funko Pops, TCG cards, and LEGO sets. The result? A **holistic collection manager app** designed specifically for collectors like us.



I created this app because I needed it myself.

Like many collectors, I started small — just a few Funko Pops at first (hold on, I think I found the one that started it all… yep, here it is!)

https://preview.redd.it/0y64dh9imtze1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=480abe9741564e93d20cbf4461733a0fadb23f57

  
I kept them neatly on shelves and tracked in spreadsheets and iPhone Gallery folders. 

https://preview.redd.it/sh27ylakmtze1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15b4e3af247f78c1a67633c6abcf2609aee2913c

It worked… until it didn’t. As my collection grew and I began **swapping and selling** items, keeping track of everything became a nightmare.

That’s when I realized: I needed something better. A digital twin of my physical collection. Something easy to use, with real-time value insights, a digital gallery, and smart inventory tools. And so I began building what’s now become my passion project.



👉 It took me around **2 months of day-and-night coding**.

👉 I obsessed over details — which might have slowed me down, but helped me build the app *I* always wanted.

👉 I tried every app out there and made sure mine fixes what they lack.



# The Killer Feature: AI Shelf Scanner

Let’s be real: manually scanning or searching for every single box when you’ve got shelves full of collectibles stacked in rows is a chore. I knew I needed a **killer feature** that no other app had.

https://preview.redd.it/6fzbr3otmtze1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10bba8fe4571fe5fe0244ab4aeddfa5ecdcc1761



So I built one.

All you have to do is take a **bulk photo** of your shelf — and the app uses AI/computer vision to identify and match the collectibles in the image. No barcode scanning. No typing. Just snap and manage. (Trust me, training it took *a lot* of coffee and quite a few more sleepless nights 😅)



https://reddit.com/link/1kitfi4/video/4ne8j55wmtze1/player



Don’t worry — I also included a **custom barcode reader** that pulls from **multiple data sources**, more than any app I’ve seen so far. (Prove me wrong 😉)

https://preview.redd.it/p5vamp7ymtze1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d0850373867d12517e9871b72d709a05970acbf

  
**Final Word**

Today marks **Day 3 since launch**, and while I’m currently battling online ad algorithms to promote the app, I’d genuinely love to hear **your feedback**.



* What do you currently use to track your collection?
* What’s missing in other apps?
* What would make your collecting experience more fun, more seamless?



🙌 I reserved **20 promo codes** for iPhone/iPad/macOS users — DM me if you want an extended trial of the full experience early.

📸 Also, tag me on **Instagram** (link in my Reddit bio) and share screenshots of your virtual gallery — I’d love to feature your collection on my page and see what rare vaulted pieces you’ve got!



Thanks for reading — and for being part of the collecting community that inspired this app in the first place.

for the past 8 months i have been dealing with on and off stomach pain. it started in one location in the upper left part of my stomach as a sharp dull pain and i felt that on and off for a few months. i got a ct scan done and it was negative. i noticed certain foods would trigger the pain so i tried to avoid them. i figured it was probably an ulcer due to stress or caffeine intake (i wasn’t much of a coffee drinker before it).. since i had been drinking caffeine more for work around that time. sometime around march this year the pain got worse and started to radiate to different parts of my stomach. i began to feel it not only in the left upper part but also the left lower and towards the middle left. the pain would go from dull, to gnawing, to burning, to sharp, to cramp-like. i would also wake up feeling nauseous and the nausea would stay with me all day. i vomited maybe twice within these past few months after eating certain foods. i also would have a lot of burping/gas that would relieve the pain temporarily. around this time i knew it had to be gastritis as my symptoms described it. the pain was on and off up until last week, it became constant and went from a 7-8/10 to 10/10 consistently. i went to the ER and they took labs, and my lipase was 79 and protein total was also elevated, but everything else came back fine. they also did another CT and showed no signs of pancreatitis or gastritis. the only thing it showed was what looked like gas/stool in the upper/middle left side of my stomach. the doctor said gastritis doesn’t affect the pancreas and he’s not sure what could have caused the elevated lipase. i am a social drinker but have to had a drink in a while. i’m also pescatarian and don’t consume a lot of fried/greasy foods. he didn’t really provide many answers to the questions I asked, so I left still feeling a bit confused.

I (24M) have recently started seeing this girl (20F) from work and we have gone out twice so far. Her and I have been talking for around 1-1.5 months. Our first date was a very basic Resteraunt, ice cream and talking date (about 1 week ago) .The second date we went on was 2 days ago and it was quite elaborate if I’m being honest. I had planned all of it, I took her to this coffee shop that she liked on instagram (she didn’t tell me to take her there, I did it on my own volition). I took her to see cherry blossom trees and then took her out to eat. Her and I talk a lot and get along really well when we are meeting in person (at work, outside etc). However, she never communicates with me over text unless I initiate. As long as we have been speaking, she has never initiated texting. When I do initiate she does reply and keeps the conversation going. She has never initiated a date, hell she hasn’t even directly every complimented me to my face. I however do compliment her and she just responds with “thank you” or “you’re so nice”. It makes me feel like she’s not actually interested in me.  However, during our second date she said something along the lines of “I see you as an investment for the future, you seem like someone who can give me the life I want to live”. This comment makes me believe she sees me as more than just a person to hang out with, but I feel like I’m doing more than her and not getting much back. I am unsure of how to proceed. I don’t have feelings for this girl, but I do like her and enjoy talking to her. I have not put any labels on her and my “relationship” and I’m just seeing how things go, but this idea of unequal exchange is bothering me. Am I overreacting? Should I change my approach? Any advice would be appreciated.

I have been on Remicade now for 2 years all has been going well, symptoms are well controlled with treatment.

I was scheduled for my infusion on the 6th of this month, only to recieve a call from the infusion clinic on the 5th that my insurance denied approval due to needing some tests that they decided were needed on April 30 and failed to notify either myself, or my Dr. 

After a LOT of back and forth the tests were ordered, and the approval was finally given, 15 minutes prior to my appointment time which I live an hour away... Not going to happen. Next available in Next Tuesday so I am not totally shot out of the water but....

I got jack sh\*t for sleep last night as my digestive tract decided to CRAMP hard at 2:30 A.M. and kept me on the toilet until 6:00 A.M. (It took that long to work its way through). 

I am not sure how bad this delay is going to make my symptoms but I have not had this sort of cramping since I effectively got into remission, and I feel like I am at ristk of coming OUT of remission, and I have a long road trip planned next month....  If I am full blown symptomatic there is no way I am taking this trip...

My gut still hurts, like having had a charlie horse, and I am on the phone with the nurse to get my questions answered, I just needed to vent as I am so thoroughly frustrated at the behavior of the insurance, they KNEW I needed time to get this done and I NEEDED my infusion...

I am staying away from coffee, dairy and anything spicy, nutty, or having skins like grapes or apples to try to minimize the issues, but ugh...

Good thing, no blood, no cloudy nastiness, bad thing, it felt like my bowels were trying to move a lumpy rock followed by a colonoscopy prep.

At a loss with my stomach. Had gastritis for 5 years now. Started during lockdown. I put it down to more alcohol. I was prescribed  40mg omeprazole a day. It’s never really got worse but never fully got better. Don’t get me wrong, I do get flare ups but can eat, never sick. But the burning and gnawing is a nightmare! And the bloating, nausea and can’t lose weight! 
I’ve stopped drinking black coffee. I’ve periodically taking things out of my diet, sometimes altogether and sometimes one at a time. I’ve removed/reduced dairy, coffee, acidic foods, alcohol and haven’t eaten gluten for 11 years. I’ve reduced my alcohol intake to mostly 1 time a week. I drink gin and tonic mostly but moved onto hard seltzer. I drink green, peppermint and black tea. I take collagen. I’ve tried biomel and probiotics. I take gaviscon when it’s flaring! 

I drank Monday and my stomach has been really bad! Done my usual, cut things down, sensible life choices…
Due to my reduction in drinking, I’ve reduced my vaping to. I hadn’t vaped for 3 days and my stomach felt pretty good. Today, I picked my vape up and within an hour the acidity was real!!! I’m wondering if anyone else has had that!? 
I mostly vape when I drink but I do at work too. Always assumed it was alcohol but couldn’t understand why a flare up would happen when I was abstaining? But I’d stop drinking, but my vaping would potentially increase.

I get it. You’re pouring your heart, soul, and a good chunk of your budget into creating advertising campaigns and social media content, hoping for that breakthrough. Yet, so often, it feels like you’re just shouting into the void, right? The digital space is crowded, and standing out, let alone achieving consistent results, can feel like an uphill battle. You see others succeeding, their ads seemingly everywhere, their engagement through the roof, and you wonder, ""What’s their secret? How can I get a piece of that action without spending a fortune or countless hours I simply don’t have?"" It's a frustration I’ve known well, and one that many marketers, agency owners, and business proprietors share. The constant pressure to innovate, to create, to perform – it’s exhausting.

What if I told you there’s a way to level the playing field, to gain insights into what’s truly working for your competitors, and to replicate that success for your own brand, all without needing a massive team or a bottomless budget? This is where I want to introduce you to something that has genuinely changed how I approach online marketing: Go Beaver AI. This tool is designed for people like us, people who want to ""spy, copy, and clone"" winning advertisements and campaigns, but in an ethical and efficient manner. It’s about working smarter, not just harder, to achieve the visibility and results you deserve.

# Features of Go Beaver AI: What Makes It Stand Out?

When I first explored Go Beaver AI, I was keen to see if it lived up to its promises. I’ve seen many tools come and go, but this one caught my attention because of its focused approach to a very real problem: cutting through the noise. Let me walk you through what this platform offers.

# Spy on Winning Ads

One of the core functionalities is its ability to uncover top-performing ads. You can search across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger using keywords relevant to your niche. Within moments, you get a look at advertisements that are already capturing attention and driving engagement. This isn't about guesswork; it's about seeing what's currently effective in the real world. For me, this immediately removes a huge amount of trial and error. Instead of starting from a blank slate, I can see what kind of messaging, visuals, and calls to action are resonating with the target demographic I'm also trying to reach.

# Clone and Customize Content

This is where things get really interesting. Once you’ve identified an ad that aligns with your goals, Go Beaver AI allows you to ""swipe"" and replicate it with a single click. Now, this isn't about direct plagiarism; it's about understanding the framework of a successful ad. The system then uses its artificial intelligence to help you generate new text, suggest images, and even create scripts that are tailored to your specific business and offer. You can take the essence of what works and make it uniquely yours. This means you maintain your brand voice while benefiting from proven ad structures.

# Comprehensive Ad Creation Tools

Go Beaver AI isn’t limited to just one platform. It supports the creation of advertisements for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Google Ads. What I find particularly helpful is the preview feature. You can see how your ad will look within the native interface of these platforms before you even think about launching it. This visual confirmation is great for ensuring everything appears as intended, from text formatting to image placement. It allows for quick adjustments and refinements, saving time and potential missteps.

# Organic Social Media and Scheduling

Beyond paid ads, consistent organic social media presence is key. Go Beaver AI assists here too. You can generate content for your social platforms and, importantly, schedule posts to go out 24/7. This is a huge time-saver. Imagine planning out weeks of social media content in a fraction of the time it would normally take. The system also includes capabilities for seasonal campaigns. Think Black Friday, New Year promotions, or other specific events – you can generate themed posts quickly, keeping your content relevant and timely. The built-in GoSchedule tool is what makes this continuous presence manageable.

# Custom Prompts for Precision

While the AI offers a lot of automated assistance, you retain control. If you have very specific requirements for your ads, scripts, or campaigns, you can use custom prompts. This allows you to guide the AI to produce results that are hyper-specific to your niche, your offer, or even a particular angle you want to test. You can instruct the AI to make an ad shorter, longer, adopt a certain tone, or focus on a specific benefit. This flexibility ensures that the output truly aligns with your strategic objectives. For instance, if I'm targeting a very niche audience with specific jargon or interests, I can guide the AI to incorporate those elements effectively.

# Who Benefits From Go Beaver AI?

I've spent some time thinking about who stands to gain the most from integrating Go Beaver AI into their workflow. While the applications are broad, a few groups come to mind immediately because the solutions directly address their most common challenges.

# Affiliate Marketers

If you're an affiliate marketer, you know that speed and effectiveness are paramount. You need to identify winning offers and campaigns quickly and get your own versions live to start earning commissions. Go Beaver AI allows you to see what top affiliates in your niche are doing successfully. You can then replicate the structure of their high-converting ads and tailor them to your own affiliate links and promotional angles. This can significantly shorten the learning curve and help you scale your efforts much faster than trying to figure everything out from scratch. The ability to quickly generate ad variations for different platforms means you can test and optimize with greater agility.

# Agency Owners

For those of us running marketing agencies, the pressure to deliver results for clients while managing costs is constant. Go Beaver AI can be a real asset here. Imagine being able to cut down the time spent on research, copywriting, and ad design by a significant margin. This tool can help your team produce high-quality ad creatives, scripts, and social media content much faster. This efficiency can translate into reduced staffing costs for certain repetitive tasks, or it can free up your existing team to focus on higher-level strategy and client management. Delivering impressive results more quickly can lead to happier clients and a stronger agency reputation. It’s like adding several specialists to your team without the overhead.

# Business Owners

If you're a business owner, particularly of a small to medium-sized enterprise, you might be tired of the high fees charged by some agencies, especially if you feel the results don't always justify the expense. Go Beaver AI empowers you to take more control over your own marketing and advertising. You don't need to be a seasoned copywriter or ad specialist to use it. The platform does a lot of the heavy lifting, from finding successful ad examples to generating creative content. This can save you thousands of dollars in agency fees or freelance costs, allowing you to reinvest that money into other areas of your business or directly into your ad spend.

# Content Creators

For individuals who focus on creating content, whether for their own brand or for clients, Go Beaver AI offers a streamlined way to generate a wide array of materials. Think social media posts, email sequences, video scripts, and ad creatives. If you've ever faced writer's block or struggled to come up with fresh ideas consistently, this tool can be a source of inspiration and a rapid content generation partner. It can help you produce more content in less time, without necessarily needing to hire specialist copywriters for every task. This means you can expand your output and potentially take on more projects.

The common thread here is efficiency and effectiveness. Go Beaver AI is designed to help these different groups achieve their marketing goals with less friction and more precision.

# The Benefits of Go Beaver AI: Why It’s a Standout Choice

When I look at a new tool, I always ask: ""What’s the real, tangible benefit for me or my clients?"" With Go Beaver AI, the advantages became clear quite quickly, and they go beyond just a list of features. It’s about how those features translate into practical improvements in your marketing efforts.

# Time-Saving Efficiency

This is perhaps the most immediate benefit I noticed. The hours, sometimes days, spent brainstorming ad concepts, writing copy, designing visuals, and A/B testing different approaches can be drastically reduced. Go Beaver AI condenses much of this process into minutes, or even seconds for certain tasks. Imagine generating a week's worth of social media content or multiple ad variations in the time it takes to have a cup of coffee. This reclaimed time can be reinvested into strategy, client communication, or other growth-focused activities. For me, time is the most valuable resource, and anything that gives me more of it is a winner.

# Cost-Effectiveness

Consider the costs associated with traditional marketing campaign creation. You might be paying hefty agency retainers, hiring freelance copywriters and designers, or investing in multiple specialized software tools. Go Beaver AI offers a way to consolidate many of these functions under one roof, at a fraction of the cost. For business owners, this means potentially saving thousands of dollars. For agencies, it means improving profit margins on client projects. This isn't just about saving money; it's about making your marketing budget work harder for you.

# Accuracy and Creativity

While AI drives the generation process, it’s geared towards producing content that is not only grammatically correct but also engaging and optimized for the platform it’s intended for. The AI learns from vast amounts of data on what makes ads and social media posts successful. This means the suggestions and generated content often have a higher baseline of effectiveness than starting from scratch, especially if you're not a seasoned copywriter. It also helps overcome creative blocks by providing a starting point or multiple options to choose from, which you can then refine.

# Scalability

Whether you're a solo entrepreneur looking to expand your reach or an agency managing multiple clients, Go Beaver AI offers the ability to scale your marketing efforts without a proportional increase in resources. You can generate campaigns for different niches, target various audience segments, and manage multiple social media platforms more easily. This scalability is key for growth. If you want to enter a new market or launch a new product line, the tool can help you get your marketing materials ready much faster than traditional methods would allow.

These benefits collectively contribute to a more agile, responsive, and ultimately more successful marketing operation. It’s about empowering you to compete effectively, regardless of the size of your team or budget.

# How to Profit with Go Beaver AI

Understanding the features and benefits of Go Beaver AI is one thing; knowing how to turn them into tangible profits is another. I've been thinking about the various ways this tool can be leveraged to not just save money, but to actively generate income or boost revenue. Here are a few avenues that I see as particularly promising.

# Affiliate Marketing

This is a direct line to potential earnings. As an affiliate marketer, your success hinges on promoting products effectively. With Go Beaver AI, you can spy on the ads of competitors who are already successfully promoting similar offers or the same products. You can then use the tool to create your own versions of these winning ads, customized with your affiliate links. By replicating proven ad formulas and quickly deploying them across platforms like Facebook or Google, you can drive targeted traffic to your offers and increase your commission earnings. The speed at which you can create and test ad variations allows for rapid optimization of your campaigns.

# Local Businesses

If you run a local business or offer services to them, Go Beaver AI can be a powerful client acquisition tool. Many local businesses lack the expertise or budget for a dedicated marketing team. You can use Go Beaver AI to create compelling Facebook ads, Instagram posts, or Google Ads targeting your local area. For example, a local restaurant could generate ads for daily specials, or a plumber could create campaigns targeting emergency repair services. By using AI-generated, optimized ads, you can attract more local customers and grow your business without the traditional high costs of local advertising agencies. You could even offer this as a streamlined service to other local businesses.

# Social Media Management Services

There's a huge demand for social media management. Businesses of all sizes need a consistent and engaging presence online but often lack the time or skills to manage it themselves. With Go Beaver AI, you can offer content creation and scheduling as a service. Use the tool to generate weeks' worth of social media posts for various clients across different niches. The GoSchedule feature allows you to manage this efficiently. This can be a lucrative service, especially since you can handle multiple clients with the help of the AI's content generation capabilities, making it a scalable business model.

# Freelance Copywriting and Ad Creation

If you're a freelance copywriter or marketing consultant, Go Beaver AI can be your secret weapon. You can use it to dramatically speed up your workflow, allowing you to take on more clients or deliver projects faster. Generate initial drafts for ad copy, email sequences, or video scripts in seconds, then use your expertise to refine and perfect them. Clients will be impressed with the quality and turnaround time. You can position yourself as an AI-augmented consultant, offering cutting-edge solutions. This allows you to produce a higher volume of work without a corresponding increase in your own labor.

These are just a few examples. The core idea is to use the efficiency and effectiveness of Go Beaver AI to either enhance your existing revenue streams or create new ones. It’s about leveraging the technology to provide valuable marketing services or to directly boost your own sales and conversions.

# How to Use Go Beaver AI

One of the aspects I appreciate about Go Beaver AI is its straightforward approach. While it’s a sophisticated tool under the hood, getting started and using its core functions is designed to be intuitive. Let me walk you through a typical process, so you can see how you might integrate it into your workflow.

**Step 1: Enter Your Keyword or Niche**It all begins with telling Go Beaver AI what you're interested in. You simply enter a keyword related to your product, service, or the niche you're targeting. For instance, if you're selling eco-friendly pet toys, you might enter ""sustainable pet products"" or ""eco dog toys."" The system then gets to work.

**Step 2: Review Winning Ads Generated by Go Beaver AI**In a short amount of time, Go Beaver AI will present you with a selection of existing ads from platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger that are performing well in your chosen category. This is the ""spy"" phase. You can look at the ad copy, the visuals used, and the overall messaging of these successful campaigns. This gives you immediate insight into what’s currently resonating with your target audience.

**Step 3: Hit ""Swipe"" to Clone and Customize Ads for Your Business**Once you’ve identified an ad or a few ads that you find compelling or relevant, you can use the ""Swipe"" feature. This doesn't mean you're stealing content verbatim. Instead, it imports the structure and elements of that ad into your Go Beaver AI workspace. The AI then helps you recreate and customize it for your specific business. You can generate new text, tweak the messaging, and incorporate your own branding and offers. This is where you make it unique to you.

**Step 4: Preview, Edit, and Deploy Ads Across Multiple Platforms**Before your ad goes live, you can preview how it will look on different platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Google. This is a crucial step to catch any formatting issues or to make sure the visual and text elements work well together. You can make edits directly within Go Beaver AI. Once you're satisfied, you can then deploy your ads. The system also helps in generating ads tailored to the specific requirements of each platform, such as Google Ads headlines and descriptions.

**Step 5: Schedule Organic Social Media Posts with the GoSchedule Feature**Beyond paid advertising, Go Beaver AI assists with your organic social media presence. You can use it to generate engaging posts for platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and others. Then, using the integrated GoSchedule tool, you can plan out your content calendar, scheduling posts to go live 24/7, 365 days a year. This ensures a consistent stream of content for your audience, even when you're focused on other aspects of your business. You can even generate themed posts for seasonal campaigns like holidays or special promotions.

This process is designed to be a cycle of discovery, creation, and deployment, making your marketing efforts more dynamic and data-informed.

# Pros and Cons of Go Beaver AI

When I evaluate any tool, I believe in looking at it from all angles. No solution is perfect for everyone, and Go Beaver AI is no exception. Being aware of both the strengths and potential limitations helps you decide if it's the right fit for your specific situation.

# Pros:

* **User-Friendly Interface:** From what I've seen, the platform is designed with ease of use in mind. You don’t need to be a tech wizard to navigate its features and start generating content. The ""point and click"" and ""swipe"" functionalities make the initial learning curve relatively gentle.
* **Multi-Platform Support:** Go Beaver AI isn’t just for Facebook. It creates content for Instagram, TikTok, Google Ads, LinkedIn, and email. This versatility means you can manage a significant portion of your digital marketing from one place, which is a huge plus for cohesive campaigns.
* **Significant Time and Cost Savings:** This is a major advantage. The ability to quickly spy on successful ads, clone their structure, and generate new content with AI can drastically reduce the hours spent on manual research and creation. This translates directly into saving money on freelancers, agency fees, or even the need for a larger in-house team.
* **AI-Powered Content Generation:** The use of artificial intelligence helps in creating copy and suggesting visuals that are often optimized for engagement. It can help overcome writer's block and provide a solid starting point for high-quality marketing materials.
* **Scheduling Capabilities:** The GoSchedule feature for organic social media is a valuable addition, allowing for consistent posting without constant manual intervention. This helps maintain an active online presence.
* **Ethical Competitive Analysis:** It allows you to learn from your competitors' successes in a way that is about inspiration and adaptation, not unethical copying.

# Cons:

* **Initial Learning for Optimal Use:** While user-friendly, like any comprehensive tool, you will likely need to spend some time experimenting with its features, especially the custom prompts, to get the absolute best results tailored to your very specific needs. Mastering its full capabilities will take a bit of practice.
* **Advanced Features Locked Behind Upsells:** The most powerful features or highest usage limits are often part of the Pro Edition or other upsells. The front-end product is robust, but if you need the full suite of capabilities or extensive DFY materials, you’ll need to consider the additional investments. This is a common model, but it's good to be aware of.
* **AI is a Tool, Not a Replacement for Strategy:** While Go Beaver AI can create excellent content, it won't create your overall marketing strategy for you. You still need to understand your audience, your market, and your goals. The AI assists in execution, but human oversight and strategic thinking remain vital.

For many marketers, agencies, and business owners, the pros will substantially outweigh the cons, especially when considering the potential return on investment from improved marketing efficiency and effectiveness. The key is to align its capabilities with your specific marketing objectives.

If you feel the pros align with your needs, this could be the moment to act:[ **Check Out the Go Beaver AI Launch Offer!**](https://softtechhub.us/Go%20Beaver%20AI).

# How Go Beaver AI Dominates the Competition

In a market filled with marketing tools, it’s fair to ask what makes Go Beaver AI stand apart. From my perspective, its unique combination of features addresses a core need in a particularly effective way, giving it an edge over many traditional methods and even some contemporary competitors.

First, let's consider its **integrated ""Spy, Copy, and Clone"" capability**. Many tools might offer ad spying libraries, and others might offer AI content generation. However, Go Beaver AI brings these elements together seamlessly. You don't just see what works; you can immediately act on that information within the same platform. The ability to ""swipe"" the framework of a winning ad and then instantly use AI to customize it for your own business is a powerful workflow. Traditional methods would involve manually analyzing competitor ads, then separately briefing a copywriter or designer, or painstakingly trying to recreate elements yourself. This takes far more time and coordination.

Second, the **depth of AI integration for ad generation and customization** is a significant differentiator. It’s not just about spinning existing text. Go Beaver AI aims to generate genuinely new and relevant ad copy, headlines, email sequences, and even video scripts tailored to various platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Google. It considers the nuances of each platform. For instance, it helps create multiple headline variations for Google Ads and previews them as they would appear in search results. This level of AI-driven, platform-specific content creation within one tool is not something you find everywhere.

Third, **affordability and value proposition** are key. Hiring a dedicated agency to perform competitive analysis, strategize, write copy, design ads, and manage social media can cost thousands of dollars each month. Freelancers, while potentially less expensive, still represent an ongoing cost for each piece of content. Go Beaver AI offers a comprehensive suite of tools for a comparatively small one-time front-end price, with optional upgrades for those who need more. This makes sophisticated marketing capabilities accessible to a much broader range\_of users, from solo entrepreneurs to growing agencies. The potential return on investment, through time saved and improved campaign performance, is substantial.

Furthermore, the inclusion of **organic social media content generation and scheduling (GoSchedule)** within the same ecosystem adds another layer of value. Many businesses struggle to maintain a consistent organic presence alongside their paid campaigns. Go Beaver AI addresses both, allowing for a more holistic approach to digital marketing. You can create ads and then generate related organic content to support your campaigns, all scheduled to go out automatically.

While some tools might excel in one specific area (e.g., only social media scheduling or only AI writing), Go Beaver AI’s strength lies in its comprehensive, integrated approach to ad and content creation, from initial competitive research to final deployment and scheduling. It’s this synergy that gives it a distinct advantage for marketers looking for an efficient, effective, and relatively affordable solution.

# Refund and Support Policy

Whenever I consider investing in a new software or tool, especially one that promises to play a significant role in my business operations, two things are very important to me: the refund policy and the availability of support. It’s reassuring to know that there’s a safety net if things don’t work out as expected, and that help is available if I run into questions.

**Refund Policy:**Go Beaver AI comes with a **30-day money-back guarantee**. This is a standard and fair period that gives you ample time to explore the software, test its features, and determine if it genuinely meets your needs and delivers on its promises. If, within those first 30 days, you find that Go Beaver AI isn't the right fit for you or your business, you can request a refund. This significantly reduces the risk of your investment. For me, a clear money-back guarantee shows that the creators are confident in their product's value.

**Customer Support:**Should you have any questions, encounter technical issues, or need assistance with using Go Beaver AI, dedicated customer support is available. You can reach the Go Beaver AI customer support team via email at **support@gobeaver.ai**. Having a direct line to a support team is crucial, especially when you're learning a new system or if you have specific queries related to your campaigns. Prompt and helpful support can make a big difference in your overall experience with any software. They also handle bonus claims through this email, so it's your central point of contact.

Knowing that there's a 30-day window to try Go Beaver AI with the option of a refund, and that a support channel is in place, provides a good level of confidence for new users. It allows you to make the purchase decision with less apprehension, focusing instead on the potential benefits the tool can bring to your marketing efforts.

# Pricing Breakdown

Understanding the investment is key, so let's clearly lay out the pricing structure for Go Beaver AI. The aim seems to be to provide a low-cost entry point with options to scale based on your business needs.

* **Front-End: Go Beaver AI**

* **Bundle Deal: Go Beaver AI Webinar Bundle**
   * **Price:** **$297**
   * This is a special offer, typically available during the launch webinar or period, that includes the front-end product plus all the upsells (Pro Edition, 50 DFY Campaigns, 2 DFY Campaigns of the Month, A.I White Label) at a significantly discounted price compared to buying them individually. If you're someone who likes to have all the features and assets from the get-go, this is the most comprehensive and cost-effective option.

The upsells provide pathways for those who need more advanced features, done-for-you resources, or white-labeling capabilities. The bundle deal at $297 represents the best overall value if you plan on utilizing the entire suite of tools and resources offered in the funnel.

Preface: There's no rules or anything stopping people at my work from dating, in fact, many people I work with have spouses who work there too. 

Weve known each other for a few years. She is closed off from most people, not a social butterfly. Except when it comes to me. What started off as friendly because when we met we were both in relationships. 

For the past 6 months or so she started showing real interest. Especially after I got a life changing promotion. I don't want to lay out all the evidence but, she couldn't even walk by me without smiling. 

I wasn't ready to start seeing someone even though I'm attracted to her, until recently, I decided I wanted to get to know her better so when the opportunity arose, I was going to shoot my shot. 

She came up to me like she does everytime she sees me. This time she asked me if I was still single, I said yes and asked her how I can get a hold of her and she blushes and hands me her phone to put my number in. 

The next day I text her something smooth and flirty, it was very clever. She doesn't reciprocate the same energy or banter and redirects the conversation back to being work related, so I had another clever response to which she didn't respond, she just laughed. 

The day after that I see her and the same thing, she comes right up to me. We talk and i let her know I can go-to break whenever and I ask her if she would like to go get a coffee on her break. 

She says she doesn't like coffee and changes the subject back to work again. We talked and laughed for about 20 minutes.

Wth is going on here? The chemistry is amazing and the energy is magnetic whenever we talk. I'm so confused.",1,1746823618.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False
1kissfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellingham/comments/1kissfh/tiramisu_judgement/,Tiramisu Judgement,"This post is something I’ve been working on for about six months now, and I was inspired by u/alikaberry and their recent gravy report post to finish it up, so shout-out to them.

Tiramisu can be broken down into four basic components: custard, lady finger biscuits, coffee, and cocoa topping. The custard should be mildly sweet and creamy with a semi-firm consistency, somewhere between whipped cream and creme brulee. It should also have a mild cheesiness due to the mascarpone. The biscuits should be moist, but not drenched with coffee, which causes them to lose structure and become mush. There should be a noticeable coffee flavor, with optional booze flavor, as some tiramisu has liqueur or similar alcohol. Finally, there should be a light cocoa powder topping. This should be somewhat subtle, and not overpower the other components. So here is my ranked list of Tiramisu in Bellingham, in order of worst to best. If I tried somewhere more than once, I have them listed by their most recent rating.

* Roman Artisan Bake 0/10

I never actually got to try their tiramisu. I went there four times and every time they were out. When I asked when they would have it again, three times in a row they told me to check back again the next day and they’d have it, and they didn’t. Eventually I gave up.

* D'Annas 4/10

Not tiramisu, tiramisu-flavored cake. More booze than coffee flavor. Texture is all wrong. Frosting instead of custard. Tiramisu isn’t supposed to be cake, and this doesn't even taste like tiramisu. Disappointing from an otherwise great restaurant.

* Fred Meyer Bakery 5/10

Okay flavor but not really tiramisu, once again tiramisu-flavored cake. It at least tastes like Tiramisu.

* Community Food Co-op (downtown) 6/10

Decent texture to the custard. Unobtrusive cocoa topping. Moist biscuits, but not much coffee flavor to speak of. Just okay.

* Olive garden 7/10

Custard has whipped cream texture, not much mascarpone texture or flavor. Spongy textured biscuits, pretty dry. Noticeable coffee flavor, not much nuance to it. Basic, but not bad.

* Mercato delle Bontà 7/10

Lots of cocoa on top, so a stronger chocolate flavor than usual. Light custard, more whipped cream consistency. Biscuits sopping but coffee flavor is weak. Ingredient list just says ""coffee"". Not bad, not great.

* Tutti Freschi Bakery 7.5/10

Tutti freschi has both a standard and gluten-free tiramisu, but they’re actually very similar, and I’d rate them the same. Overall they have an unusual texture. The custard has a frosting-like consistency. The biscuits are more firm and crumbly than typical. Not much coffee flavor, but they have Marsala wine in them, which gives a pleasing but unusual flavor. Okay overall, definitely unusual.

* Lombardis 8/10

Light on the cocoa. The custard is firm and not too sweet, which I like. The biscuits are a bit dry, but have good coffee flavor. Good overall.

* Tutta Bella (bought at Lakeway Fred Meyer) 8/10

Light on the cocoa. Custard has great texture and flavor. Intense coffee and liquor flavor in the biscuits, which are very wet. Love the flavor, but it loses points for the biscuits being mushy.

* Mambo Italiano 8.5/10

Light, fluffy custard, more whipped cream consistency. Great coffee flavor. Plenty of biscuits, but they are are a little dry. Very good.

* Whole foods 7/10

Texture of the custard is okay, a little cheesy. Powerful coffee flavor, but the coffee itself isn't the best. Ingredient list says instant coffee. The biscuits are drenched and mushy. Tasty, but lacks subtlety.

2nd try 9/10

They must have changed their recipe! Light custard, good biscuit texture, strong coffee flavor. Best cheap option by far at only $5 per slice.

* Penny Farthing 9/10

Good cocoa taste, not overpowering. Custard firm and not too sweet. Very structured. The biscuits are a little dry. Present but not overpowering coffee flavor, with some well-balanced booziness, which makes sense given they are in Chuckanut Distillery. Excellent, only misses a perfect 10 due to the slightly dry biscuits.

* Storia Cucina 9/10

Lovely custardy texture and flavor. Great coffee flavor, with biscuits perfectly moist. Subtle cocoa on top. There weren’t very many biscuits though, which left me wanting more. Excellent.

2nd try: 10/10

There were more biscuits this time. Perfect. This is the pinnacle of Tiramisu in Bellingham.

I asked my girlfriend if something happened during last night, any power outbreaks and she said that nothing happened.

I took the machine to a partner to test it out, he said that he plugged the GPU in another motherboard and it killed the motherboard and PSU too, he found out the some capacitor had burned out, but he said to me that the NVME was gone, no signal at all, and when installed the PC would take like 30s to get to the bios page since there was no bootable device.

The importance of the identity: I teach that I'm all that is.

**I am love. I am perfection. I am always chosen. I am everyone's top priority. No one is better than me. No one compares to me.**  
That’s my foundation—right?

And then the rampages of self—being super exaggerative. I'm not being humble whatsoever with what I say, because anyone can only think what I think they're going to think.

So the worst thing you can do is think what other people think. That sets the foundation of things.

And just like these negative things we can say to ourselves—we become.  
You'll become what I say in the beginning of those videos.

**I became that.**  
Like—that is me. I don’t—I don’t... In the beginning, I didn’t feel it. In the beginning, I didn’t worry if I felt it. I said it anyway.

I spoke over that old feeling of the shittier identity I had.  
And I eventually became it, because eventually, what you keep attaching to ""I am""—**you become.**

Right?

So now, if I set an intention, I’m doing it from a place of power. And that very thing comes in.

And it stays because of my core foundation, of course.  
And why am I saying all these other things? To amplify that and make me magnetic—like, fly off, right?

So I want to talk about how getting the logical mind on board can make life so much easier. Because the logical mind—remember, the left side of the brain—is ""seeing is believing.""

The right hemisphere of our brain, with our ""I Am"" awareness, is **""believing is seeing,""** *knowing is seeing*.

This is where we want to function—to select our realities from imagination.

Now, what happens is: the logical side of the mind is like, “We'll fight you!”  
No—because the logical mind needs the proof. It needs something from the physical plane to figure out *how* and *why* what you're saying is correct—without any proof or evidence.

Right?

Now this—this is what I'm going to throw at the people who say **""the self-concept doesn't matter.""**  
Even though I already just said why it *does* matter.

But now—to get the ego on board, to shut it the \[expletive\] up—self-identity. The ultimate identity. All—identifying as **all that is**, is what I say. And other things, of course—you can bring it into your awareness through rampages, or whatever you want to say.

You get it on board—because it needs—by giving it a reason.

So who do you think—now, for all those people who say self-concept doesn’t matter, “Just do a technique all day, bro,” “Just speak it to water all day, bro.”

Now, the person who says:

**""My SP is so in love with me, we’re in the most perfect, committed, loving relationship""**—  
and their identity is:

**""I'm not good enough. People ghost me. I suck. I have a bad history with relationships. I just don’t feel chosen ever or prioritized.""**

Right?

So when someone like that says,  
**""My SP is in love with me,""**  
this and that’s all they say—like, that’s it—and that’s their core foundation…

The logical mind—*pop*—your ego pops up, and it’s like—right? It was having a little sip of coffee in the back and almost like spit out its coffee laughing at you. Laughing at you, because you’re putting your importance on something *outside* of you and forgetting who the *you* are.

Forgetting everything comes from you in the first place.  
That you’re the **source of all things**.  
Nothing can exist without your awareness of it.  
That you're **all that is**, and you have everything within yourself already.

Right?

Now—now look at this.

Now if I say:  
**""This person is madly in love with me, can’t stop thinking about me, and is super committed to me** ***because*** **I’m all that is. And I’m perfection. And no one’s better than me. No one compares to me.""**

Right?

Now—if I have spent a long time reminding myself who I am—in fact, I remind myself every morning who I am—I still do, right?

And now if I’m doing that, and I say:  
**""This person can’t stop thinking about me because I’m so unforgettable. Because no one’s better than me. I’m love itself.""**  
When I say that, and that’s already **who I am**, it means the ego is already on board. It doesn’t even fight me on that.

And my world has already reflected that to me.

So then, now—when I say something with intention, and I say that:  
**""This person can’t stop thinking about me, is madly in love with me,""**  
he’s drinking the coffee, right? And it’s like:

**Cheers. That’s true.**

**Because you are all that. There you are. We’ve already established this. I've already seen the proof. We already feel it. We've already seen it.**

We’ve seen the evidence.  
You’re magnetic—like FES—so of course, when you say this person feels this way, you gave me the reason.

**""This person’s madly in love with me because I am love.""**  
Okay, you’re right. Can’t fight you.  
Can’t fight you.

So that materializes pretty quickly.

And then when it does—right?  
When you can literally **command your day** as you go about your day:  
**""This is going to happen. This is going to happen. Because I’m all that is. Because I’m perfection. Because I’m always chosen. Because I’m the man. Because I’m Aeon’s personified.""**  
Whatever you want to say—there’s no resistance.

That voice in your head’s like,  
**""Ah, you’re right, man.""**

And then—when it *does* come in, when it *does* materialize (which I was trying to say)—  
**It stays.**  
Because your foundation is built on **rock**.

So now—what do you guys want to do?

Do you want to rely on a technique and **affirm your life away** the rest of your life?  
Or—do you want to set that foundation, get the ego on board?

Because the same way you got the ego on board with,  
**“Your life sucks,”**  
because you kept saying all these things:  
**“This, this, this,”** and  
**“Men treat me this way,”** and  
**“All this is this,”** and  
**“I don’t have a good relationship with money,”** and all this…

And you created this ultimate identity of—

Why do you think it’s so easy for that to stick around?  
Why do you think that’s so easy?

Why do you think you could just say something one time—like,  
**""Of course this is going to happen to me,""**  
and then *boom*—there it is?

Oh—because your ego's on board.  
**""Okay, we're not going to fight you. We're right where we're supposed to be. We're right where we're supposed to be.""**

That’s why reminding yourself and setting that foundation is **critical**.  
It’s **crucial** to living your best life.

And then, you can sit there—and when I say **deny the senses** and **live in mindsight**, you can sit there and **tell your eyes what to see**.  
You can **tell your ears what to hear**.  
You can **tell those thoughts what to think**.

And there’s **no resistance** toward them, because you’re **all that is**.  
You’re identifying as all that is—**love**, **perfection**, **always chosen**.

You don’t need that, bro.  
**""No, we just need techniques all day!""**

You—you just—you guys—  
You guys want to need all those things and need all the help outside of you, when the answer was **always within you** the whole time.

Now, at the same time, guys—also check this out:

Say, you know, you get to that—you identify as the **ultimate identity**.  
And you—you—you accept no other. You accept nothing less, right?  
You realize you have the answers for everything.

Right.

Now, if in the past you’ve had experienced success with a certain method, right?  
And I don’t have a problem with techniques.  
I’m just saying—they only work **because you believe in them**.  
You **give them the power**.

But—if you have success with a certain technique,  
**don’t stray from it**,  
because your logical mind **witnessed it**.

You—what we're doing here to succeed—is understanding that **reality starts in the right hemisphere**.  
This is the **actual reality**. This is the **cause**.  
The outside is the **effect**.

**Believing is seeing**.  
It is **seeing it first**, **believing it in here**, and **then seeing it out there**, right?

And this side—again—it needs to **see it to believe it**.

So, if you’ve managed to witness things materialize—and this happens to me—that’s why I don’t even hear that voice in my head anymore talking to me.  
It’s always on board. It’s very rare.

And if I do, I **talk back down to it**, and I say **how things are**, and I **rampage about myself**,  
and all of a sudden it brings in **more glory for me**—because I shut it off.

But—if your **left**, your **logical mind**, has seen you **victorious** in certain areas—  
**use that to your advantage**.

Use it to your advantage—but do it knowing that you’re doing it to **experience the truth**,  
**not to make something happen**.

Because it’s already **seen you victorious** doing that very thing.

So don’t ignore that, okay?

We want to get that—the least amount of **yap** from the logical side—the better.

Right?

And again, the best way to do it is with **self**.

Give that logical side—the ego—a **reason** for **everything**.

Every day, my wealth increases because my mind is worth millions.

Everyone wants to work with me because I'm bright, brilliant, and shining.  
Give it a reason. Give that logical side of you a reason, rather than just saying that thing outside of you that you want to be true—  
that you're claiming to be true with a shitty-ass foundation built on sand, right?

And then, when you rampage about during the day, you're building on top of that foundation,  
and you become unstoppable.  
And then, when you say something that your whole entire mind has accepted—  
*that's who you are.*

So then, when you say something and you give it the reason *because of who you are*, it's on board.  
And you don't have to effort and effort and effort.  
""This doesn't work."" No.  
Then you command everything.  
You see something?  
""No, it's this way, because I'm all that is.""  
""No, it's this way.""

Right?

Business owners—  
if you want everyone to work with you, it's not about them.  
It's about you.  
It's about *you* deciding how great—how great what you have to offer is.  
How, everywhere you go, people are like:  
""Who the f\*\*\* is this person who's so amazing?  
I need to work with them.  
What they're offering—what they're offering is pure gold.  
I can just tell by how they speak about themselves, how they carry themselves.  
They're just oozing that—that—that magnetic energy.  
They just know that love is within them.  
That perfection is within them.""

Not that narcissism.  
Bro, you don't need it.  
Bro, you don't need it. Again—you don't.

But do you *want* to live your best life?  
Your dream life?  
Set for life, with being everything magnetically drawn to you—  
where you don't have to chase something?  
You don't have to constantly wonder:  
""Am I doing something right?""

No.

You build a foundation with self.  
Then you decide how everything goes.

And then, you give the ego the reason *why*—because you're all that is.  
It's that simple, guys.  
Get that shitty voice on board and become unstoppable.  
Eventually, it can't—it can't even say anything anymore.

And this goes for *any* circumstance that can pop up.  
""No, it's this way.""  
That's when *you* decide what your eyes see.  
You decide what they hear.  
You decide what things mean.

Because **you are all that is.**  
Because **you are love.**  
Because **you are perfection.**  
Because **you are always chosen.**  
Because **you are everyone's top priority.**  
Because no one's better than you.  
No one compares to you.  
Because, therefore, you are perfect—just as your Father in Heaven is perfect.

Alright, guys, hope I got my point across.  
In fact, I *know* I did.

I'll either post it tonight or tomorrow.

1kisprd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1kisprd/i_work_abroad_at_a_japanese_theme_park_another/,I work abroad at a Japanese theme park. Another kid has gone missing (Part 2),"Previously, my girlfriend Aiko and I had rescued a missing child. 

You might think I deserved to feel like a hero, that I might be filled with pride or honor. But instead my chest tightened with a damp, foreboding heaviness.

The kid did not look right. His eyes were permanently open, and his lips were frozen in a sinister smile. I know it might’ve been some crazy symptom of paralysis, but seeing the boy like that just *felt so off.*

Aiko was worried about him too, so she joined his late night ambulance ride to keep an eye on his breathing.

That night I walked back to my accommodations at Aiko’s aunt’s cottage, and I wished the story would just wrap up there. Just a nice: *We were Heroes! End of Adventure!*

But it only got much worse.

\*\*\*

You see, my phone started getting random notifications from the theme park app. The application called Bakery Park Hunt*™*

I was walking home, in the middle of sending encouraging texts to Aiko, trying to help her feel brave for her emergency ride, when my phone bombarded me with:  *“Cinnamon nearby! Would you like to pick some?”* 

I clicked on it, and immediately my phone entered camera mode, showcasing the dirt road at my feet. A cartoon stick of cinnamon walked into frame. ""*Follow me please!""*

I didn’t feel like playing the Pokemon Go knockoff, so I closed the application. But that didn’t stop my phone from opening back up and pinging me ceaselessly.

*“Cinnamon nearby!”*

*“Vanilla nearby!”*

*""Saffron (RARE) nearby!”*

It was enough to kill the battery and end my communication with Aiko completely.

So I did the only thing I could. I snuck back into my room at the cottage, and went to sleep.

\*\*\*

I woke up to the smell of green tea drifting through my room. Out of habit, I peered over to my left to see if Aiko was awake, but her bed was as empty and unmade as she left it.

On my phone I could see several messages from her:

**1:04am -** *Remember 2 tell Nana*

**1:06am -** *Cant txt more. Guard.*

**1:32am -** *We’re at helipad.* 

**1:45am -** *The paramedic says the boy is stable! He is alive! I can’t believe we actually saved someone, its like the movies. We did it. We saved his life!!*

**1:50am -** *I didn’t want to be around that guard. So I took the paramedics offer and I’m taking the last seat in the helicopter. I can act as a placeholder guardian.*

**2:07am -** *I feel so much better being away from those guards!*  ε-(´・｀) ﾌｰ

**2:08am** \- *Tell Nana I will be at the general hospital in Shimado, I should be back in 1-2 days!*

**2:10am -** *I’m so sorry they put you in that holding cell. It's unfair you’re in that jail. I hope they don’t keep you there long.*  (｡•́︿•̀｡)

**2:11am** \- *But forget those stupid guards, they don’t know what they’re doing. Let me know when they let you go please! I hope they treat you okay* (；\_；)

 

I wish I had a chance to respond to these messages. Aiko still thought the other guard had taken me under arrest. Thankfully that wasn’t the case.

 

**2:14am** \- *WOW the view is beautiful from up here. I’m so sorry for dragging you through this. But it was worth it. We saved the boy. The medics say he’s going to live. He’s in some kind of shock, but he will live.*

**2:16am** \- *I promise no more adventures like this again. I don’t want you to get in trouble. I don’t want the police to get involved.*

**2:20am** \- *I didn’t even think about how this could affect your visa. I’m so stupid stupid stupid stupid. What a mess. I am so sorry. I feel terrible. Please text me as soon as you’re free. I know they probably took your phone away.*

**2:27am** \- *It was my idea to save the boy. I’ll tell them I forced you to help me. I’ll make everything my fault.*

**3:06am** \- *Made it to the hospital. They’re giving me a room. I hope to hear from you soon.*

**6:05am** \- *The boy’s family is here! And yes we were right, it is Kaito! This is crazy.* 

**6:07am** \- *Mom and son reunited* (♡´･ᴗ･\`♡)

  

Attached was a photo of Kaito in a hospital bed, hooked up to some kind of respirator. His mother was there, in tears, but clearly happy to be able to hold her boy’s hand again. I don’t normally gush over this kind of stuff, but it honestly warmed my heart. 

 

**6:10am** \- *Text me please. I’m so worried about everything.*

 

I did text her. I explained my phone had died, and that I wasn’t in any jail. I told her that I was so happy she was OK, and that she could text me throughout the day. More than anything I wanted to hear her voice, so I said to call at any time.

That sunken feeling in my chest had lifted a little. *Maybe things weren’t so bad.*

In the kitchen, Aiko’s aunt was already working on her sudoku. There was an egg and rice meal waiting on two different placemats at the table.  

I remember it feeling very strange to have a morning alone with Nana-obasan, especially after such a weird night. I didn’t really know what I was allowed to share yet, so I did my best to keep my composure.

“Good morning, Nana,” I said. 

“Good morning.” Her focus was on solving one of the columns. 

I tried to word my 5th grade Japanese in a way that would explain what had happened without scaring or alarming Nana. Eventually, halfway through my breakfast I produced my declaration.

“Nana, you should know that last night, Aiko and I saved a child who had gone missing. We called for help and an ambulance took the child away. Aiko was a real hero and even accompanied the child on the helicopter ride. She is currently at Shimado hospital, and she says she will be back in 1-2 days.” 

I held up my phone to show her the texts, but quickly realized she couldn’t read our English exchanges. So I lowered the phone and said. “She texted me all this in English, but you can call her if you want.”

Nana lowered her tea and looked at me briefly above her reading glasses. I think she believed me, but she only really seemed to focus on the tail end of my speech.

“So, Aiko is coming back in a few days?”

“Yes.”

She went back to her sudoku. “Okay.”

\*\*\*

Although Nana-obasan may not have appreciated what happened last night, I kept replaying events in my head in total disbelief. Focusing on the positive.

Aiko's hunch proved true. We had saved a kid. *We were heroes.*

I avidly re-read all of Aiko’s texts, imagining her type them. There was a flutter in my chest from the anticipation of hearing more.

I took a shortcut rounding the forest edge to get to work. I still had a shift at Bakery Park today, and I felt it was critical not to show up late. I’m sure I would be asked a dozen questions about last night, and would have to explain Aiko’s absence.

As I walked along the gravel road I tried to get my story straight. I would focus on the good news: Aiko and I had rescued a kid for god’s sake. Surely, that would render our trespassing meaningless? Did anyone actually care that we had snuck into the park late?

Then my phone chirped. *“Candy floss nearby! Would you like to pick some?”*

*For fuck’s sake.* I clicked to close the app, but couldn’t. Suddenly I was staring at a polygonal version of Bakery Park’s premiere mascot.

It was **Mashumaro**, **the marshmallow tanuki.**

Just like in the Confection Showroom, half his face was missing. It's like his pixelated skin couldn’t quite cover his skeleton wireframe. He was dancing in a field of cotton candy. His voice was garbled, yet loud enough to peak my phone’s speaker.

""Jēmusu Naka jūgyō-in# 604373, kon'nichiwa!""  
*( James Naka Employee #604373, Hello!)*

I tried to turn down the volume on my phone, but the interface was frozen.

""Sakuya wa issho ni asonde kurete arigatō!""  
*(Thanks for playing with me last night!)*

This virtual mascot found a way to hijack my phone. None of my buttons worked. I freaked out a little. I even yelled without meaning to.  “Stop. Stop this!”

The virtual mascot’s smile lengthened. He switched to English. “Stop what? Aren’t you glad you saved little Kaito’s soul? Hehehehehehe.”

I was surrounded by nothing but trees and the gravel beneath my feet. It was just me and this digital nightmare. I was irrationally afraid, but I covered it up with anger. “Who the fuck are you?”

The tanuki waggled his rear toward the camera, grabbing cotton candy from the field. “That’s a little rude. I don’t talk to rude boys.”

“Are you a hacker? Are you kidnapping kids at Bakery Park?”

Using the cotton candy as pom-poms, Mashumaro danced to the left and right, performing a little Macarena. “You better not be so mean next time. Or else.”

The app closed immediately. My phone returned to my home screen.

I tried to open it again, but all that loaded up was a benign-looking inventory. It said I had collected candy floss.

*Jesus Christ what was that?*

It seemed to me like there might be some *nefarious hacking* happening. Like some terrorist had been able to exploit software at Bakery Park to capture a kid in the first place. And now he was trying to manipulate me.

The thought chilled my bones.

And it was possible that this was the *same* hacker who was responsible for kidnapping the other two missing children. And if that was true, who knows how many future kids could still be at risk…

I decided I would have to tell the park staff my whole story.  Everything. Children’s lives could be at stake.

I typed out last night’s events in English on my phone, converting it as coherently as possible into Japanese. For two years I had taught how to assemble speeches and essays for highschoolers in Tokyo, so it was about time I wrote my own.

Whether or not Mashumaro could still spy on my phone and see what I was doing —it didn’t matter to me. Let him see. Let him be afraid. All this disorder had to stop.

\*\*\*

I arrived at the entrance to Bakery Park just before my shift was supposed to start. A big, bowing animatronic of Mashumaro in an apron greeted me by the front gate. His eyes had the typical upside-down V’s of anime joy.  

 

\^\^ 

 

Normally, this bowing statue would pep me up a little, make me excited to start my day, but today it only gave me goosebumps.

Without wasting time, I bee-lined to the employee check-in station. I wanted to tell my supervisor I had important news regarding the Confection Showroom, I had a whole, concise speech written out.

As if reading my mind, the supervisor actually came to *me* after I punched in. “Naka-san, good morning. I want you to follow me. You’re wanted at the head office.”

\*\*\*

All my training had been at the welcome center, so I had never actually been at the head office. Unlike the rest of the park with its pink, yellow or other candy-colored buildings, the corporate building was unapologetically beige, hidden behind trees.

My supervisor took me past the lobby, and we rode the elevator to the top floor, where we arrived at an empty reception area in front of a couple offices.

“Wait for a minute, I’ll let them know you’re here.”

I sat as straight and still as possible. I was about to silence my phone, so I didn’t get a ping during the meeting, when I received one more text from Aiko

**9:12AM** \- *Something is wrong with Kaito. He’s making weird guttural sounds that the doctors don’t understand. And he’s talking now. But in an old man voice. Like a really old man voice. He keeps saying “More will come. More will come.” I’m really scared. The parents are angry with me, they think I did something to their son. They’re not letting me leave.*

Huh?

I quickly messaged back: *‘Katio’s parents aren’t letting you leave? What do you mean?’*

A minute passed. Then another. I was glued to the screen, checking for at least a checkmark, a confirmation to see if Aiko had at least read my text. Nothing. 

The door into the largest office opened. “Please come in.” 

\*\*\* 

It was the tall guard from last night who ushered me in. The one who was supposed to put me in a ‘holding place’. My gut contorted with so much stress that my intestines may have formed a balloon animal.

Instead of his night guard uniform, he was now wearing a brown suit and tie. He introduced himself as Keibiin (which literally translates to ‘security guard.’)

I was imagining a small desk and a window, something akin to a school principal’s office, but instead I had walked into an enormous penthouse suite, with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the layout of Bakery Park. It smelled like coffee, cigarettes and a weaker version of the same sweet scent they pumped throughout the whole park.

“Welcome to Satou-san’s office,” Keibiin gestured wide.

Mr. Satou stood facing one of the large windows, coffee cup in hand. He was a short man, wearing big horn-rimmed glasses, slacks, and a dress shirt. No tie.

I proceeded to bow, deeply and formally. I knew how important decorum was in Japanese office culture.

Satou moved to go sit at his desk and dismissed my gesture as if it were unnecessary. He pointed at the many chairs close to him. “Come, come, please join me.” 

Myself and Keibiin followed. As I sat, I noticed the walls were overloaded with framed newspapers, magazines and articles all featuring glowing praise for Bakery Park. The majority looked quite old.

“So, I heard you were quite the savior last night, yes?” Mr. Satou asked, topping up his cup.

""Yes ... we … we found a missing boy.” Is all I managed to say. Keibiin must have told his boss all about the events of last night.

“Good. We want to make sure our guests feel safe on our island. Quite important don’t you think?”

“Of course. Yes.”

“And when the guests feel safe on our island, they will keep coming back to our park, yes?”

“... Yes.”

He was keeping the Japanese slow and simple for my sake, which I appreciated. But it also made me feel like a four-year old.

“And it would be bad to start any unnecessary rumors, yes?” 

“Yes.” 

“Because we don’t want to scare our guests, right?” 

Keibiin turned in his seat to look at me. He reached into his jacket’s breast pocket and pulled out some cigarettes. The corners of my phone dug into my thigh, as if the speech I had written was nudging me. I smoothed my pants. 

“No. we don’t want to scare our guests. That would be bad.” 

A cigarette was lit. Mr. Satou continued.  

“It is regrettable that we’ve also had children go missing on the island. But unfortunately, that’s what we get with an untamed forest and free-spirited parents who let their little ones run wild. I’ve had my Bakery Park scoured many times for them.” Satou took a sip of his coffee, and briefly glanced out the window. 

“Obviously we would release a statement if a guest had been confirmed missing at our park, but so far there simply has not been any evidence, has there, Keibiin?” 

Keibiin took a slow drag. He spoke without exhaling the smoke. “None.”  

""So Naka-san, tell me … ” Mr. Satou leaned forward on his desk. I could see two tiny, hunched versions of myself in his glasses. “ … Where exactly did you find the missing child last night?” 

I opened my mouth, then closed it. My phone felt like it weighed twenty pounds. 

""We found the boy crumpled on the ground. Unconscious I think … “ 

 It became very quiet; the AC unit had cycled off. I looked at my hands, at the stamp I was forcefully given last night at the back of my palm.

森  
(forest)

I could feel both of their eyes scanning me up and down. Searing through me. 

 “... He was in the middle of the forest.” 

 Keibiin exhaled a long plume of tobacco. Mr. Satou leaned back in his chair.  

 “Well thank goodness you went looking. Very noble of you. I can see you have the forest reserve’s official ink-brand. So that all adds up.”

 “Yes it does.” 

Satou lifted his cup and nodded back. “I had no clue I was employing such selfless heroes at my company. How long have you been working here?” 

I looked up and pointed to myself. “Me? About two months.” 

 Satou drank deeply from his cup, emptying the whole thing. Then he circled the rim with his finger, playing with some thought. “Well Naka-san, you have proven to be very exemplary in your short time being here. I have a new position that would be very well suited to a Westerner actually. If it interests you.” 

“What do you mean?”

Satou looked over at Keibiin and released a small laugh, “I mean exactly what I say.“ 

There was something in the Japanese I wasn’t understanding. The small man reached into his desk drawer and pulled out some paper covered in kanji. He scribbled something along the bottom, then inscribed his signature.

“How would you like a promotion?”

\*\*\*

In the elevator down I had trouble processing what just happened. Had I been bribed? *Is this what a bribe feels like?* I held onto what I assumed was my new contract and tried to make out the characters. 

I could read ‘Bakery Park’ and ‘change of wage.’ It looked like they were going to pay me triple what I was making before. But was this good news? Or had I agreed to something terrible? 

I didn’t know who I could trust at this park anymore. The person I needed to talk to was Aiko. I checked to see if she had responded to my message. 

It was still unread. 

 My fingers started texting a follow up—if she didn’t respond by noon, I would try calling her on my break. Before I could hit send however, I got a notification from Bakery Park Hunt™

 *“Molasses nearby! Would you like to* —**SAVE ANOTHER SOUL?**” 

Once again, I was staring at a polygonal version of Mashumaro. His head hadn’t loaded properly, so it was just his smiling face floating above his torso. His body was backstroking through a well-rendered brown liquid, reflecting white light.

""Jēmusu-chū shain# 604373! Kon'nichiwa!""  
*( James Naka Employee #604373! Hello!)*

""Go keiyaku itadaki arigatōgozaimasu.""  
*(Thank you for signing the contract.)*

“What?” I said in English first, to which Mashumaro didn’t react. So I repeated it in Japanese. “What are you talking about?”

The screen turned blinding white.

""Anata wa ima, watashi no tame ni hataraite imasu.""  
*(You work for me now.)*

The whole elevator shook. I grabbed the railings. Then, without any warning—the elevator dropped.

I was tossed about a foot in the air.

For few punctuated moments—all was weightless. 

Then I landed hard on my back. 

The lights went out.

I’m not normally claustrophobic, but in this situation I was hit with an intense fear that something was going to cave in on me. I hugged my knees and curled up in a corner.

A weird, familiar ‘chirping’ sound came out of my phone, stabbing and prying out some old memory that I couldn’t quite place. 

After lying curled for a few minutes, I snatched the device and saw that the headless 3D model of Mashumaro was howling with laughter.

Then I placed the noise. It was the sound effect of a character laughing in *Animal Crossing*. A repetitive little chirp. 

“Please. Tell me.” I asked in Japanese. “Who are you?”

""Aiko-san wa totemo yoi suketto de shita. Watashi-tachi mo tetsudatte kuremasen ka?""  
*(Aiko was a very good helper. Will you help us too?)*

The mention of Aiko riveted me to the floor. I stared at the screen unblinking.

“What do you know about Aiko?”

""Watashi mo Sonoko no koto ni tsuite kanojo ni messēji o okurimashita.""  
*(I messaged her about the kid too. She was so eager to help)*

My heart sank. Was *Mashumaro* the whole reason she wanted to go searching for the kid last night? Was she being manipulated on her phone?

“You messaged her last night?”

The tanuki dove into the shimmering lake of molasses. When he popped back up, his head had finally loaded.

""Watashi ni shitagatte kudasai,-sō sureba wakarimasu. Hihihi!""  
*(Follow me and you will see. Hee hee hee!)*

Mashumaro swam up to a beachy shore, where he sat up and blew a kiss at the camera. The scene ended and the app flashed: *You have collected molasses!*

I tried to swipe back to Mashumaro, but he was gone. The app just showed me a virtual jar of molasses next to cotton candy.

The lights turned on again, and the elevator resumed its normal function. I stood up, feeling all the aches across my back. A goose egg formed at the back of my head.

When the door opened, I ran out—practically knocking a custodian to the ground.

**Thinking back at it now, this was probably when I truly had my first panic attack. I remember that feeling of adrenaline in my throat and lungs. That shaking in my legs.**

I ran until I was at the main thoroughfare of Bakery Park, away from all the buildings, away from anything that could trap me. Even though I was surrounded by guests flowing towards the attractions, I had never felt so alone in my life.

Aiko was my entire anchor. She wasn’t here to guide me. It was just me on this foreign island where I couldn’t properly understand the language or dialect.

And a fucking mascot was sending me ominous threats in the theme park app.

I sat at a bench, held my head, and just breathed. 

I was expected to work today, and pretend everything was normal, but everything did *not* feel normal. It’s like Aiko and I had opened a Pandora's box that only we were privy to, and the troubles of the world were going to swallow us up.

Over the next ten minutes I remember running through all my options to calm myself down. 

**1.)** I could leave.

All of my stuff was at Nana-obasan’s house, and if I wanted to be a dick, I could just grab it and go. But… I couldn’t do that. How could I leave without Aiko returning? I didn’t even know where Aiko truly *was* at this point. I at least wanted to make sure Aiko was safely back home.

And even if I wanted to ghost everyone, I would have to book a ferry, and then book somewhere to stay. The whole reason I was working at this theme park was because I was broke and couldn’t really afford to do those things…

In a very real sense I was kind of trapped here.

And so I settled on the next option.

**2.)** Push through.

The only way forward was through. If I could at least work through the rest of today, maybe I’d get some news from Aiko. Maybe she’d finally call me. Hearing her voice would cool everything down about a thousand percent. And when she came back, I’m sure she would explain away the creepy guards and intense CEO as some kind of cultural misunderstanding. There’s no way, this is all as scary as I’m making it out to be right?

So that’s what I told myself. Aiko would call me soon, and we could figure this out together.

\*\*\*

After gathering enough fortitude, I marched back to employee check-in, chanting a mantra in my head: *Aiko will call me. I will get through this. Aiko will call me. I will get through this.*

When I arrived to grab my name-tag, my supervisor greeted me kindly. He explained that he had already been notified of my promotion. 

My new role would be extremely busy and there was a lot to explain, which was music to my ears because I just wanted to occupy myself with anything.

“Good. I’m glad you’re excited because I’ve got some fun news,” he took my keycard and enabled some new permissions. “You’re going to be working at our brand new attraction today. For the first time ever … we are opening the Confection Showroom!”

“You mean, the abandoned building?”

“Not anymore,” he smiled. “It’ll become your new home. They’ve made you into a cast [member!](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/)”",1,1746823166.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False

Recently started brewing a lot at home, and buying a lot of beans. I have a couple coffees (one Sey Washed, one La Cabra Natural) which seem to be aging in a somewhat unusual way only 2-3 wks from the date opened -- toned down aromatics, lots of syrupy caramelized flavours replacing bright fruity / floral flavours -- despite carefully storing in [Fellow Atmos ](https://fellowproducts.com/products/atmos-vacuum-canister)canisters. Any thoughts? 

As a single coffee drinker who brews a lot of single cups, but still can't keep up with multiple 250g bags, **what is the best way to enjoy multiple coffees over a reasonable period of time?**



TL:  
I've recently stated working from home, meaning I have the opportunity to stop buying multiple cafe cortados (or whatever) per day and instead make pourovers at home. As such I've been buying from top local roasteries and also started a [Roastful](https://www.roastful.com/coffee-subscription) subscription. My setup is listed below. I know enough to be dangerous but hardly an expert.   
  
**Dumb Storage**:   
Initially I was just storing beans in the retail bag after opening, and noticed the expected staling odors and flatness in the cup after maybe 3 weeks. 

I tried putting a few of my small [sample bags](https://www.brandywinecoffeeroasters.com/products/coffee-magic-sample-bog) (also opened) in the freezer after  squeezing out all the air. This was perhaps slightly better. But I'm not storing long term -- just long enough for me to finish the bags. I have perhaps 6-7 bags going at a time (including smaller / tasting sets) so I don't need endless storage like some of y'all. 

**Smart Storage (?):**  
Watched the [Hoffmann video ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DK0JWuhE8a-w%26pp%3D0gcJCfcAhR29_xXO&ved=2ahUKEwj9gNKzl5eNAxVELVkFHXjtLvgQtwJ6BAgKEAI&usg=AOvVaw25k_kNcJLmIyEQLVb8b7dl)and some others and decided on the Fellow, and now have **5-6 manual** [**Atmos**](https://fellowproducts.com/products/atmos-vacuum-canister) **.4 / .7L canisters**. For the past month have been Atmos twist / sealing immediately after I open the retail package (whenever I feel they're ready, typically 14 days +1 from roasting, I never seem able to wait any longer) and pour out the first 15g. The canisters sit on my countertop, not in direct sunlight, near an AC unit so they are sitting comfortably at 18-24C all the time. Once in a while one of the seal indicator will 'fail' which is attributed to offgassing. This has not happened more than once or twice per canister, and I just reseal the next morning or whenever I notice it. 

  
**What I'm noticing now:** with the Atmos storage, instead of getting oxidation / staling impacts 2-3 wks after opening a given bag, I am now noticing, with a couple bags particularly, a slightly unusual turn, over of the last week or two, where the coffee seems ""darker"" -- not as if it's medium roasted, particularly, but just down on 'high' or floral tasting notes, still offering a lot aromatically but everything closer to brown sugar, molasses, caramelized fruit, slightly oxidized red wine, etc. Mouth feel is thicker generally. 

As a somewhat novice 'serious' brewer I am experimenting with a lot of other things, but I change these variables (water remineralization, brewer, recipe, water temp) frequently and still seem to get similar results from these two coffees in particular. Is this normal variability? Am I going nuts? Should I be increaseing 

  
**Water**  
Zero water remineralized with La Cabra drops to 30-50 ppm, or Lotus Water usually Light and Bright Recipe, etc.

  
**Gear**  
large size Switch (glass), always preheated with boiling water

Copper v60, also preheated

Cafec T-90 filters 

KinGrinder K6, coarse at 100-105, fine at 90-95 -- *this may well be the weak point in my setup, I failed to pick up an 078 on /coffeeswap last week : /* 

Fellow kettle

  
**Methods**  
Almost always 15/250. Hoffmann fine-ish 100c 5-pour, latest Hedrick coarse-ish 1-pour, Coffee Chronicler guy hybrid pourover / immersion, pure Switch immersion, variations of the above. I used to brew everything at 94/96c but Hoffmann has prevailed and I am brewing frequently at 100c, particularly when trying to get more ""life"" out of these older (but not *that* old) beans. 



**Beans**  
La Cabra, [Rio Brilhante](https://us.lacabra.com/products/rio-brilhante?showBanner=false&lastClicked=1746820784523), Brazil, Catuai, Natural.   
Roasted Apr 7, Opened (and moved into canister) Apr 20

Sey, [Kubi](https://fellowproducts.com/products/2025-kubi-washed-ethiopia-1), Ethiopia, Landrace, Washed.   
Roasted Apr 14, Open (canistered) Apr 22

I also had some beans that I *preferred* after some time in the canister: Hex [Duverney Sanchez Suns](https://store.roastful.com/products/duverney-sanchez-suns-pink-bourbon-washed?srsltid=AfmBOop6TavNfQriyX1aLf5kvIVg9rRujIcQsXs3AzT0hy2RuxSo_DGr), Pink Bourbon, Washed, Colombia. (via Roastful subscription so roast date not certain, but my favorite cup of this bean was after it had been stored in the same canisters for maybe 2wks, \~ 1 mth off roast.) 

  
I also tried the [Bean and Bean](https://beannbeancoffee.com/collections/shop-all-coffee/products/roast-level-tasting-set-kenya-yara-ab-washed) Kenyan roast level testing set. Only tried the Light and Medium, the Medium is quite a dark medium in my experience, and it's possible that it gummed up all my equipment, but I clean the grinder almost daily and clean everything else as well as one can (alas without a dishwasher). These haven't been in the canister long enough to have an opinion. 

  
**Beans On Order**:   
La Cabra [Kinini](https://us.lacabra.com/products/kinini), Rwanda, Washed

Compensation:
• The salary is competitive.

Training:
• Short periods of training. Most of the time you will just side barge with agents who are also new and don’t know the process. It is because they keep losing employees (either leaving or getting terminated within the shift).

Management:
• Communication from management is consistently poor and lacks transparency.
• Speaking up about issues is discouraged. Voicing concerns often leads to subtle retaliation.
• Issues raised by employees are rarely acknowledged, let alone resolved.
• Confidentiality is non-existent. Sensitive matters are frequently gossiped about by members of management.
• FAKE EMPATHY. For instance, while they say it’s okay to take sick leave, doing so may later be used against you.
• Do not expect coaching sessions as they do not offer one unless they are planning to terminate you.

Workplace Environment:
• The production floor has a bleak and demoralizing atmosphere, with very little engagement or team spirit.
• While some agents are genuinely great people, management lacks integrity. They often present a friendly facade while engaging in toxic gossip behind employees’ backs.
• Pantry space is limited. Though the balcony is available for breaks and lunch, but it’s poorly lit and uncomfortable. Best of luck in finding a place to eat when it is raining and everyone is on lunch at the same time.
• There is no real work-life balance. Overtime is strongly encouraged and often expected. Declining it may result in being labeled as uncommitted or uncooperative.
• Termination of employees are done during the shift. It’s sad that terminated employees have to undergo “walk of shame” as they pass-by their colleagues while being escorted out of the facility.
• No career growth.

Benefits:
• Health coverage is average and offers basic HMO services.
• On-site amenities include free rice, juice, coffee, and candies — a small perk in an otherwise underwhelming setup.
• There is no on-site clinic. If you’re unwell, your only options are to go home or visit a hospital, making it impractical to seek medical help during work hours.",1,1746822801.0,AntiworkPH,1,0.67,False

He exhibits both narcissistic and sociopathic behaviour and it's not an exaggeration to say he destroys any relationship he's been in both romantic and platonic. 

I ended contact with my dad in January 2020 - the final straw was I had an operation and I didn't hear from him for 3 weeks. When he did call me, he didn't ask me how it went or how I was. When I raised it with him he simply said ""you would have called if something was wrong"". 

When I explained why I was ending all contact he simply responded with ok, you know where I am. No accountability or responsibility. 

Fast forward to May 2025, and I've had a message from him which reads ""afternoon, would you like to meet for a coffee one weekend, just you and me x"". 

I am in totally shock to be honest. He's never tried to contact me. Not during a world wide pandemic. Not during or after the birth of my son. I think his current relationship is going downhill which has promoted this. I know this because my brother still has contact with him but from the little I've heard about their relationship, my dad is still very much the dangerous, manipulative person he always was. I'm also really annoyed how flippant the message is.

I don't know what to do. My whole body is telling me not to meet him. Even if I set boundaries - he'll try to break them as he has previously. 

One part of me feels sorry, I know I shouldn't, because he's lonely and had a bad upbringing but I don't think that should be an excuse for treating me so poorly. I feel like I've already grieved this relationship. Opening that door again scares me - I know better so why am I finding it difficult to just say no. 

For context I've not yet responded. Message sent from my dad 3 days ago and I've been in turmoil since. I have a good life. A peaceful life. Am I right to want to keep the status quo or should I meet him to hear him out?

“Hot... but not haute.""

After weeks of deliberation (and far too many Hodinkee rabbit holes), I finally pulled the trigger on a Baume et Mercier Riviera 10764, terracotta orange dial, sized 36mm. To be blunt, I wasn’t expecting it to become my daily (especially after recently picking up a 14060M), but here we are. It’s not just a watch. It’s an entire mood.

There’s a kind of quiet confidence in this piece. The dial is utterly unique, like if Tuscany and Côte d’Azur had a child who studied architecture and then opened a coffee shop in Kyoto. The light plays with it in ways that photos never quite capture. Depending on the hour, the dial shifts between burnt clay and a moody amber.

At 36mm, it wears close to the wrist, comfortably snug without feeling diminutive. Due to my athletic build, I was initially wary it might look too modest on my wrist, but the dodecagonal bezel and integrated bracelet lend it a real sense of presence. It’s compact, not shy.

Movement-wise, it’s reliable with the Sellita SW-200, nothing to write home about, but then again, this isn’t a watch that’s pretending to be haute horlogerie. It knows what it is: a well-designed, extremely well-finished Swiss timepiece with just enough flair to stand apart from the endless sea of divers and field watches.

I work in an environment where most of my counterparts daily drive Daytonas or GMT-Masters. Amongst those beasts, this watch doesn’t scream for attention, it quietly hums along. People notice, but it’s always followed by a second glance, a *“Wait, what is that?”*

I’ve worn it to meetings, dinner dates, airport lounges, and every time, it simply fits. No fanfare, no fuss, but it **always** starts a conversation.

I'm very pleased with this purchase and if you are similarly looking for an integrated bracelet sport/luxury timepiece, I highly endorse this Baume et Mercier Riviera. I purchased directly from their website and the shipping was quick, with lovely packaging and a personal note from the regional B&M brand ambassador. I wish other brands would take note of this level of service... but this is to be expected from the Richemont Group.

NOTE: I have a 6.6"" wrist so this 36mm fits me perfectly. I could probably do the 39mm, and most likely WILL just to get their Riviera with the gold dial and the in-house Baumatic movement. Cheers.",16,1746822515.0,Watches,20,0.91,False

Compensation:
• The salary is competitive.

Training:
• Short periods of training. Most of the time you will just side barge with agents who are also new and don’t know the process. It is because they keep losing employees (either leaving or getting terminated within the shift).

Management:
• Communication from management is consistently poor and lacks transparency.
• Speaking up about issues is discouraged. Voicing concerns often leads to subtle retaliation.
• Issues raised by employees are rarely acknowledged, let alone resolved.
• Confidentiality is non-existent. Sensitive matters are frequently gossiped about by members of management.
• FAKE EMPATHY. For instance, while they say it’s okay to take sick leave, doing so may later be used against you.
• Do not expect coaching sessions as they do not offer one unless they are planning to terminate you.

Workplace Environment:
• The production floor has a bleak and demoralizing atmosphere, with very little engagement or team spirit.
• While some agents are genuinely great people, management lacks integrity. They often present a friendly facade while engaging in toxic gossip behind employees’ backs.
• Pantry space is limited. Though the balcony is available for breaks and lunch, but it’s poorly lit and uncomfortable. Best of luck in finding a place to eat when it is raining and everyone is on lunch at the same time.
• There is no real work-life balance. Overtime is strongly encouraged and often expected. Declining it may result in being labeled as uncommitted or uncooperative.
• Termination of employees are done during the shift. It’s sad that terminated employees have to undergo “walk of shame” as they pass-by their colleagues while being escorted out of the facility.
• No career growth.

Benefits:
• Health coverage is average and offers basic HMO services.
• On-site amenities include free rice, juice, coffee, and candies — a small perk in an otherwise underwhelming setup.
• There is no on-site clinic. If you’re unwell, your only options are to go home or visit a hospital, making it impractical to seek medical help during work hours.",1,1746822314.0,GetEmployed,0,1.0,False

I'm 32M, although i keep getting comments about looking much younger. Genes duh. Anyways i'm kinda tall around 5'11, dark hair, brown eyes. Personality wise, I'm an introvert and rarely engages strangers unless they reach out first. I'm trying to change this and make new friends in the process.

I will be in London on Saturday and was hoping to break out of my shell a bit and do something out of norms. I'd like to meet someone with similar interests over a coffee and just chat for half an hour or something. 

I'm a huge fan of movies, tv shows, crypto, building pcs. I used to play some games but no time lately. Nowadays I mostly play Counter strike from time to time.

I will use the bike mainly for commuting (mix of pavement, loose gravel and dirt bike lanes,  all a fair bit uphil) and a few shortish coffee trips throughout the week.  I come from an old 3x7 and never had a 1by and am therefore unsure if the gear spacing will suit me and the type of riding I am doing and if the lowest gear is low enough for a hilly terrain.  

So my question is, if I should get the grizl 6 1by or the grizl 7 2by. Seeing that they apparently use the same frame, does it make sense to go for the 1by and maybe upgrade to a 2by if I dont like it. Or is it worth it to pay for the higher end groupset and maybe delete the front mech if i want to try 1by.
(The 2by grizl 6 seems not available any more at all in my location)

I am preparing for my exam which is next monday and it's been pretty much like a fulltime job with no break days for almost 3 weeks at this point. Needless to say I'm exhausted, but my very future depends on it so I absolutely fkn need to pass it.

Anyways, I woke up today with no mood for other people, anything loud etc. My grandma is our neighbour and comes over every morning to have coffee with my dad. It's meh because I'm not in the mood for her every single day, but whatever, it's not my house. But today I heard her from my room and I was just so pissed off that I will have to go past her and talk and be asked unnecessary questions/small talk and listen to my dad being loud (his hearing is a bit bad and he's an obnoxious person in general so tends to be loud af).

Stayed in bed for 2 hours just because it killed my mood to get up and start the day. I then went to tell my dad to pls cut it off for the next 3 days and have coffee outside. Just a short break, then they can continue their old person type gossip meetups. He brought her in again later in the afternoon and she asked me something and I responded with a slightly raised voice and obviously frustrated. She didn't care though since they know I'm stressed about the test so prolly thinks it's that.

And then I had the lightbulb moment. I don't really care about them hanging out in the kitchen and I have no problem with them, it's just that I don't want to be fucking talked to and ""bothered"". I need a lot of time where I'm not being perceived by others anyways, but today I genuinely just wanted to be a mess going out to take a piss without talking to anyone right after waking up, do my business and go back to my room.

I told my dad this and didn't escalate anything by being annoyed to no end. (I can get quite confrontational with him because he's used to having random people over which I despise in general.)

I think this is the first time when I didn't offend someone by being ""rude"" (as in pls leave me alone or get out) and blowing up, but still let steam out by recognizing my needs. It took away the focus from them and allowed me to give myself grace and alone time.

I still can't wait to have my own house, but this was a win because I don't feel like shit now either from offending someone or from the fact that blowing up at someone doesn't solve the overwhelming feelings.",11,1746822053.0,AutismInWomen,0,0.93,False

1kis6ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextBestBro/comments/1kis6ed/38m_lakeland_fl_married_guy_looking_for_a_legit/,"38M, Lakeland, FL | Married guy looking for a legit friend","Honestly, this feels a bit weird and gross to post, but being vulnerable is part of making friends I guess. I think when I meet most people for the first time and even most people that know me only casually likely assume I have a decent number of friends and am socially adept; however, the truth is I've never had a ton of friends, and like many guys my age, I’ve ended up as a lone wolf, aside from my immediate family and coworkers. That’s partly due to moving around a lot, but it’s also just who I am.

I’m hoping to find a guy to hang out with occasionally—nothing too crazy. Ideally, I’d love to find a best friend, but I’m realistic about the chances of that happening. And realistically, that level of friendship takes years, even decades to develop. I’d be happy to grab a cup of coffee every once in a while, and I’m open to grabbing a beer too. That said, the older I get, the more health-conscious I’ve become, and I’ve never really liked ordering alcohol at a bar when I could get a six-pack for the same price. But maybe that’s why I’m here…

More about me: I’m married and have kids, so it would be great if you’re in a similar boat. It would make connecting a lot easier. I typically work out 4-5 days a week, but I’m not a gym rat. I’ve always been outdoorsy—camping, backpacking, rock climbing—but I haven’t done much of that in Florida, you know, because it’s Florida.

I’m a casual sports fan. I enjoy watching games and find the talk radio storylines interesting, but I’m not the kind of guy who gets hung up on stats or the top 10 of all time talk. On the nerdier side, I’ve taught myself web development over the past few years. I have a side project I work on when I can, but it still feels more like a hobby for now. I use it as a form of disconnecting from other stuff. I guess this is my version of video games for some guys.

I could go on, but that's probably enough for now. As a heads up I'd like to get to know anyone online a bit first, but I’m mainly interested in connecting with people who are in or near the Lakeland, FL area for a real life friendship.

Hello kind folks, 

I just started a new job and am waiting for my first paycheck. I share custody of my children with my ex husband and have my kids this week for spring break plus work every day and am in need of some funds for groceries and gas. I will get my paycheck on 04/16 but it deposits late at night so I can repay the next day on the 17th. 

Thank you!",1,1746821768.0,borrowdeletes,1,1.0,False

People gather here even before opening hours and there even is a very small coffee corner in there to get your morning coffee. I am nearly Level 37 in pogo and want to contribute to the local pokestop saturation. Also it would fit well in the newly established route i created. ,10,1746821767.0,NianticWayfarer,6,0.92,False
1kis5pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1kis5pv/please_help_me_some_advice/,Please help me. Some advice?,"Help. I still feel terrible. Every day is filled with boredom and depression. I take risperidone, fluoxetine, and oxazepam, but nothing helps. I don't get enough sleep. Some days, I cut myself. Some days, I think about suicide. I tried it one time, but my parents cached me. I don’t want to hurt my family—I have to keep living—but it's getting harder and harder.

I'm 23 now. I've always tried to be a good person. Whenever I did something wrong, I punished myself. I was scared of relationships. I avoided pornography, alcohol, and coffee—I’ve actually never tasted coffee. In college, I was afraid of making friends or going to parties. I feel extreme anxiety about stupid things, like jaywalking. I’ve never had close friends, except for my family. I was always scared of people.

When I was 21, something unexpected happened. A random girl texted me. She was amazing, but later I found out she was only 14. She started developing feelings for me. I only wanted a purely online friendship. But then something else unexpected happened—we both ended up in the hospital. She had a severe illness, and I was there for mental health reasons. While we were there, she reached out to me again. And a doctor confused me—he told me I should date her if I liked her. I was uncertain, but in the end, I decided to date her.

After I was discharged from the psychiatric hospital, I felt weird about dating a kid. I planned to break up with her after she recover, but not at that moment—I didn’t want to hurt her. We never met in person, and we never talked about anything inappropriate. I wrote her a few love poems, and her parents let me send her some gifts. I just wanted her to be happy. But then she died.

It’s been a year now, and I don’t know what I’m living for. I realize I was stupid for avoiding parties and fun things when I had the chance. I even tried watching pornography now—it was interesting, but also made me feel guilty. The next time I tried, it was boring. Nothing is funny anymore. I can't just start doing things I was always so against my whole life. I still feel guilt about random things. I still cut myself. I just don’t know what to do.

My parents check on me every night to make sure I’m okay. I don’t want to hurt them. But it’s so hard. I cry almost every night.",1,1746821760.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

Im here for some advice on how to proceed with a new project.

So anyways, Im in Kenya now and have free reign on the landscaping of our new home build. Ive heard so many positives about ground mount solar over top of farmland, so Id like to incorporate it either in my backyard garden or across the street overtop of my quarter acre coffee plantation.

The panels would have to have about 8 to preferably 10 feet clearance underneath and I plan on having the panels power my house and my sister in laws house next door and have battery backup.

I think the trickiest part will be the wiring, if its across the street I can do underground wiring to my property, but not next door since their place is already built up. If its in my backyard I would still have the same issue connecting it to their house.

Im not too concerned about cost, the materials will be the main cost, labor is a negligible cost here. I plan on having a larger solar project than our combined needs, go big or go home.

Id love to hear some thoughts on this, I hope I provided enough info.",1,1746821636.0,solar,12,1.0,False
