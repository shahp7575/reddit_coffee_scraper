1i6fe83,https://i.redd.it/pfniyc7xmbee1.jpeg,Morning! ,"I was previously a barista at the uk chain Costa however there was no quality control on the coffee produced. This due to the sheer numbers of customers, quantity over quality. It did however give me a good understanding of making coffee. Decided to buy an espresso machine for home recently and I think it proves that you don‚Äôt need a ‚Äúgood machine‚Äù to make good espresso. 

The machine I have is the Breville Barista Mini which cost me ¬£130 new. I have upgraded the portafilter use a WDT tool, tamper and filter screen on my puck but I get very consistent results, I went with the cheapest options for these off aliexpress!! 

I asked for advice for a grinder a few weeks ago and was recommended the Kingrind k6- this has been fantastic and I would definitely recommend, it‚Äôs definitely worth the investment. 

Although my milk isn‚Äôt perfect here, it taste absolutely lovely and I am a strong believer they you don‚Äôt have to have the best to make good espresso.

I just want to turn my face away and sleep. I get this meh feeling, instead of feeling any sort of elation or joy. ( But I do feel elated while in the act) 

Is it related to ADHD? I have observed this particular thing not happening when I am on medications or have a cup of coffee before sex.

1i6f8n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1i6f8n6/its_not_your_fault/,It‚Äôs not your fault.,"I‚Äôve been reading all over the internet how people are struggling with social skills more than ever before. Overthinking things, being insecure, not having social energy, brains are not coming up with responses in the middle of conversations, flaking without explanations, ghosting, etc. The list goes on.

It‚Äôs not your fault. If you are from the U.S. and you are a millenial, gen z, or a younger generation, you most likely never knew or belonged to a 3rd space. You never knew village, community, and you don‚Äôt live in a country where its infrastructure caters to people. 

After doing much research I‚Äôve realized that the U.S. is the only place that suffers from chronic loneliness and it is not the people‚Äôs fault. If you take a puppy away too soon from its litter, it will not learn how to play fair, communicate, behave, and it will have anxiety, depression and other behavioral problems. It will not know how to cope with simple things in its life. Everything will be too overwhelming and it will become depressed. 

We are the only country in which our communities are isolated, separated, it does not encourage real life socialization. The fact that millions of Americans resort to TikTok, a social media app as their 3rd space, is one of the most socially unhealthy things that we could do as a whole. Too many people rather be comforted by watching people through a screen, in their own, home, in their own bed, covered in their own cozy blanket. It‚Äôs all fun and games until it isn‚Äôt. I sound like an old ahh person saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that damn phone.‚Äù But our parents were right, It certainly was that damn phone. I‚Äôve had so many friendships this past year that I had to let go because I was constantly being disrespected by people who would flake on me, just to see them being active on TikTok, I would hop on discord with friends to play video games and while we waited for a game to load, TikTok was in the background, no communication, just silent. When I planned coffee dates with other friends, we‚Äôd be in the middle of a serious conversation and they‚Äôd pick up their phone while I was talking and check TikTok as if it was a withdrawal. They‚Äôd look at their apple watches every 30 minutes AS I am talking. I had a conversation with my friends about simple etiquette and they laughed at me‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt understand. What is funny is that when people do it them, they don‚Äôt like it and they find it ‚Äúrude.‚Äù 

I am not saying TikTok is the problem. It‚Äôs that people have lost their damn minds and have stopped prioritizing real life interactions. Our country is also not made for people to spend time with each other. And the fact that people think it is so funny and cute to say that they‚Äôre going to be a hermit and cancel plans last minute because they‚Äôre socially drained it angers me. The only reason why people would be socially drained is because they‚Äôre on social media ALL the damn time. This is not normal. I also work for behavioral health, and the amount of things that could be solved if people just had friends is insane. 80% of people going to therapy go to therapy because they lack the opportunity to socialize in person. It is not as easy to tell someone, ‚ÄúJoin a club‚Äù or ‚ÄúGo to the bar‚Äù. I‚Äôve joined so many clubs and even THAT is fleeting. People don‚Äôt show up to things even when you consistently do. It‚Äôs dead out here. This is an epidemic we are experiencing. ",2,1737453382.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

Having worked in two fully remote companies, I‚Äôve learned a thing or two about keeping teams engaged, even when we‚Äôre all working from different corners of the world. The key? Overcommunication. Here are my top three tips:

1. **Overcommunicate (Yes, it‚Äôs a Thing)** When you‚Äôre remote, things can get lost in translation‚Äîor worse, completely unspoken. Make a habit of overcommunicating important updates, project progress, and even small wins. This helps everyone stay aligned and feel connected, even without face-to-face chats.
2. **Prioritize Connection, Not Just Work** Remote teams often miss out on the casual interactions that happen in an office. Schedule regular virtual coffee chats, team games, or casual Slack channels to encourage non-work-related bonding. Engagement isn‚Äôt just about productivity‚Äîit‚Äôs about relationships.
3. **Make Feedback a Two-Way Street** Engagement thrives when people feel heard. Create safe spaces for feedback‚Äîboth for you as a manager and for team processes. Act on their suggestions to show you‚Äôre listening and invested in making remote work better for everyone.

These strategies have worked wonders in my experience, and they might just help you, too. What‚Äôs worked for you to keep your remote team engaged? Let‚Äôs share ideas!",0,1737452992.0,askmanagers,0,0.5,False

These usually include the Moccamaster, Sage/Breville, (the two which I‚Äôm most interested in), plus a few others.

The testing usually involves putting the same amount of ground coffee and water into each machine, letting them run on the default setting and then tasting the result. The bit which I wonder about is that the same grind size is used for all.

This contrasts with typical testing for espresso machines where the reviewer will dial in the grind size for each machine.¬†

I wonder why reviewers don‚Äôt spend a little bit of time at least dialling in the grind when they review different filter machines to get the best out of each.

I‚Äôve had a KBG select (with the automatic drip-stop) for a couple of years and just bought a KBT (with the manual drip stop). I‚Äôve found that I need quite different grind sizes on each to achieve good results, and these are from the same brand, so I wonder how different the results would be between different brands.

I apologize for any spelling and grammar mistakes. I can't be bothered to fix any of them.

I lost the love of my life.

It was a week after I came back to my country after going to my bestfriends wedding. I've been quite low in life for as long as I can remember. I was dealt a bad hand in life. My friend that I hangout with roughly once a month invited me out to go get drinks, to get out of the house after having to leave such a euphoric time with my bestfriend for a week on her wedding, I agreed. 

We will call my friend T. T and I went to a newly opened karaoke bar. Laughed at all the terrible drunk singers and I had a few too many drinks. Still sober thinking straight but things were wobbly. Fun thing  about me that will come important later, is I wear these sick combat boots with little pockets on the side of them. I love rocks and pebbles, they just make me happy, so I have a few rocks from every place I've been in my boot pocket, along side a rubber duck. Following this, my lanyard has what is called an ""Anxiety Fox"" attached to it. It's a small stuffed Fox that fits in the palm of your hand that you can play with when anxious.

T and I took part in the drunk karaoke and I went up with my anxiety fox. The people loved that little guy there. But that bar was alot more friendly than the other bars in my small, military town. The bar closed pretty early and we decided to go to the spot he usualy goes to as I have never went before (I hardly ever go out often). He told me to not be planting my silly little trinkets around over there as I might just get stabbed (he was joking).

We made our way to the second place, I'm still wobbly in my step and needed to go use the ladies room, told him to go get a seat for us as I travel to the washroom. As I wobble my way out of the washroom, I accidentally ran into a man, his face was blurry as I was definitely not paying attention and my only goal was to get to my friend T. I spoke a soft apology and sidestepped my way past the man. I found T at a table and joined him. We were seated at a corner spot and at the bar is a bunch of pool tables. I never played pool before so I was turned fully around in my chair enjoying watching everyone play some pool, trying to figure out how it was played.

During me observing the games played, this other man comes up to me, very excitedly and gasps ""is that a beetlejuice jacket?!"" My trenchcoat i was wearing was a beetlejuice jacket that was color blocked black and white. I got excited to talk to someone and stood up to show it off. He asked if he could try it on and I let him. He ran to his group of friends and started posing and within this group of friends was the man I accidently ran into trying to find my table. My jacket was given back and their friend group migrated to our table and started talking with us. They offered us some darts to smoke and I don't smoke so I declined but T was interested and left with a few of them outside to smoke. 2 stayed behind and talked to me. After they all came back. The guy who bumped into me accidently tried to spark a conversation with me very awkwardly which didn't really get anywhere as everyone else was much more loud than he was. We all ended up migrating outside the bar and that's when T and I were invited back to their place to hangout. T knows I don't normaly do things like this and offered to drive me back home but I felt silly that night and decided I wanted to go.

T left to grab his car in the other parking lot and the guy who bumped into me, let's call him D. Decided to wait behind with me with a few of his other friends to make sure I was safe. While waiting, I pulled out my anxiety fox and showed it to D. I offered him to name it as I haven't yet. Sir Valenciano was the name. Once trevor came back and we all made our way back to D's place. I took my seat on the floor which sparked up the memory of me having trinkets in my boot. Wanting to show off my wonderful collection, I had everyone's attention and they all thoigh that was the coolest shit ever. D, took even more interest and gave me one of his mini figures he painted to also put in my boot which I happily did. After this, I started to enjoy talking to D alot. I got up and stood next to his chair, trying to figure out conversation. He grabbed a chair and pulled it next to him and offered me to sit. I happily obliged. With that, I asked him what kind of music he enjoys, he mentioned he listens to whatever but a lot of meme/brain rot music. To which I was fluent in. I began singing the entire ""Carl Poppa"" song off by heart to him, and his jaw dropped and he stared at me the entire time with bewilderment in his eyes. I finished and he stood up and slammed his hands on the table infront of us and yelled ""I FOUND MY FUTURE WIFE. I JUST GOT SERENADED WITH CARL POPPA"".

From then on, I kept joining him in the front for his smokes and to continue having smaller, private conversations with him. All of our interests aligned, we were both severely nerdy and loved being artistic. I had given him my number and by 4am rolled around T and I dipped. I immediately  msged D, telling him how much fun I had with him and he told me he felt the same. A bonus is that D only lives a 4 minute drive from my home. That night forward, we hungout every single day and all his friends adored me, he treated me like no other had ever treated me. We eventually fell in love and started to date. He introduced himself to my bestfriend and activley tried to be interested in all the things that made me happy. I started growing all mybpassions back that ive lost years ago, and finding the colour in so many things that i struggled so much with. It felt like the little me came back from all the years of life trauma and i felt like myself again. Everything went so incredibly well. We traveled a little bit, started planning to move in eventually and talking about what our future could be like. Always discussing how we want to continue to better ourselves for eachother in ever way possible. At some point in our relationship he had lost his job and was depressed and stressed out. To try and help him out, I'd go over to his place and pick up his laundry because he didn't have a washer and dryer where he was renting. And took them home with me to wash and bring back to him all nice and clean. I felt so incredibly happy to do this for him because he made me feel so seen and loved that I just had such impulses to do the same for him. My heart yearned to take care of him. I'd help with making sure he was able to eat, and had gas to drive. I made sure he always had money on him until he was able to find a job again. I comforted him through the entire process and made sure than nothing I did was ever too much and that he was never seen as a burden to me.

He eventually got super sick with something and I also took care of him through that. Offering to drop him off medicine, get him food, a hot water bottle. Anything he needed. Unfortunately during all of this, I was going through a rough patch at home, but still wanted to be there for him. My house became a mini war zone familt constantly screaming, I'm getting belittled and insulted. My sanctuary was him at the time. When he got better, unfortunately was also when my mom also almost died and my family had to call EMS which only started more screaming in the home. D, was there for me the entire time, texting me, comforting me as much as possible. So when I saw him next, I was sort of dissociating alot. I laid in his lap for most of the night as he watched shows and playing with my hair as I made comments here and there. We watched movies in bed all cuddled up until we fell asleep. And I ended up going home the next day at 6pm which was my mistake. When I went home, I was almost immediately attacked by my family. Was called a stupid c*nt, my door slammed. They all started talking awfully about me out of nowhere. I started having a panic attack, sobbing and begging them to stop, I was dragged around physically and I ended up completely breaking down and msging D. Asking if he was busy. He was out with his roommate and friends so he couldn't come get me, which was fine. But I still told him what happened and how I need to pack my things and leave immediately, that I no longer can stay there. He was understanding and comforted me again. That same night, he was texting me how much his friends adore me and how much he loves me, just going off as he usualy does with how much I make him feel cared for. The next day rolls around and his messages in the morning felt off. Cold. He never texted me ever like that. So I asked him what was wrong. And that's when everything stared going down.

It wasn't like I was even talking to my sweet boy anymore, he was telling me how exhausting I was and he wasn't happy with what I was bringing to the table currently. And he needed space to think. I waited 12 hrs. And during those 12 hrs I acted imemdeitly to his feelings, going to other people for support so it wasn't just  all weighed on him and trying to rekindle some older relationships. I had told him I wish he told me these things sooner so I could have fixed them immediately instead of having to feel this and letting it build up. He came back saying this would be the last time he will respond and expressed how he hated that it took me this long to realize and need to change. But the thing was, there were no signs and no communication to this at all. I was completely lost and thought everything was perfectly fine between us. 

He and I struggle with mental health, we both used to SH in the past. Out of fear that what is happening would trigger him to harm himself. I msged his roommate to make sure he's safe and cared for. Nothing descriptive, but to just be there for him since I wouldn't be able to since he left so abruptly. And hr after msging his roommate that, I got a msg from D, calling me manipulative, childish and disgusting for ""texting all of my friends that wr have broken up to try and get back to me"" which i did not do. I only texted his roommate to just keep him safe. He didn't bother listening to any of my words and left. Blocked me on everything. Everything we had ripped and gone in literlay less than a day. I pray everyday that he'll come back and I'll have my door open for him with warm blankets to wrap him up in and make him a hot coffee. But I'm afraid I'll never see him again. Idek what happened, it all felt like whiplash. Before that night, we always took care of eachother and was always there for one another. But after my familt and my mom almost dying, it's like... idk.. something flipped a switch. All of a sudden I was too much and too ""woe is me"" and saying I complain too much but I was quite litterlay going through hell and just needed my person. He never reacted that way to me before and I just can't understand what happened.

It was a nickname I chose for myself back in 2015 when I was an instructor at iD Tech summer camps. I did 5 years of camp and became an online instructor during the pandemic. Now I do after school programs in my local school district, teaching Python and Dungeons & Dragons.

I've been singing in choirs in the Bay for about 20 years, currently just joined up with the Pacific Edge Voices up in Berkeley. Graduated from Castro Valley high.

I'm pretty big into D&D and Star Citizen, my profile history doesn't lie. I love Arcane and The Expanse, and I'd love to attend musicals if I had the money to go see them in person. I've got a big collection of board games that rarely see play.

I have some good friends already, though I am looking to expand my horizons a bit and put myself out there more often to connect with people.

Dating stuff: I've been single for a couple of years, after a 7 year relationship that taught me a lot of lessons. I'm pretty mellow about it, I'm not so deeply hurt that I couldn't love again. I hope that whoever I connect with has done some self-reflection and is willing to communicate needs and boundaries well.

I'm a cheap date, I'd rather have coffee/boba and go for a walk, or maybe visit the Exploratorium. I'll show you my favorite sandwich spot. I'm the person who would hand-deliver a burrito to your work when you haven't figured out lunch plans yet.

My adult life has been almost entirely under mild financial stress, so I get the struggle. I'm doing ok now, though I'm trying to save up enough to move out from my parents' (again).

I've got an orange braincell-renter named Atlas that lives with me. He's been claiming my lap every day for the past couple of months.

I like to cook. Bacon-wrapped chicken, mashed potatoes, pasta, nachos, dino nuggets if I'm feeling extra fancy. I drink socially but don't like being drunk. I get really talkative and my puns get really bad, then I get super sleepy.

There's a lot more to me, but hey. I've gotta save some of it for later.

1i6ey3i,https://i.redd.it/4hlvpjzqgbee1.jpeg,Indochina Tri-Country trip report and FAQs,"Long post ahead :)

We did an Indochina (Ho Chi Minh - Siem Reap - Bangkok) tri-country trip last June 2024 for 9 days (not including air travel time). Here‚Äôs a detailed trip report as well as FAQs that were mostly asked in a tiktok video that I posted. Please take note that it was our first time to travel in all 3 countries. I also attached the travel/transport itinerary below.

Ho Chi Minh üáªüá≥
Since we only had 2 full days here, we tried our best to fit in as much attractions as possible within District 1. We skipped the full day tours outside the city to maximize our time in HCM. A lot of attractions were within walking distance which was easier for us. Their sidewalks are also big which really helped us out a lot during our walks. Grab is also very cheap if you‚Äôd like to avoid walking. However, crossing the roads there will be very daunting due to the amount of motorcycles. So make sure to get a travel insurance just in case!

Vietnamese food is definitely the best out of the three countries (based on our preferences ofc!). We also joined a cooking class at Hoa Tuc Restaurant which was basically an eye-opener for us on how creative and healthy their dishes are cooked. Would you believe that we made 3 dishes with just Patis/Fish Sauce used as condiment? Their coffee is also out of this world. As someone who drinks black brewed robusta coffee everyday, I thought I was prepared for what Vietnam has to offer but it was still a little strong for me (the strongest one was from highlands lol). However, I still found Vietnamese Coffee the best tasting coffee based on my preference. Just make sure to eat before drinking!

The history and culture of Saigon was one of the highlights of the trip. Since we didn‚Äôt have the time to do the Cu Chi Tunnels Tour, we visited the War Remnants Museum instead which I highly recommend. Not only was it educational, but it was an emotional experience as well. The visit made me resonate, empathize, and understand the Vietnamese people more after knowing the hardships that they experienced in the past, which also still affected the present of a fraction of their population.

Siem Reap üá∞üá≠
Our trip in Siem Reap was mostly just to relax between the jam-packed HCM and BKK trips so we didn‚Äôt plan much in the itinerary. From the bustling Pub Street to the relaxing spas, the city is a perfect balance of laid-back and fun! Not to mention that their cuisine is amazing. I didn‚Äôt really expect much in regards to Khmer food, but it definitely is waaaay above my expectations. Indochina food really is crazy.

On our second and last day in Siem Reap, we joined a Sunrise Angkor Wat Tour where we visited the Angkor Wat complex, Ta Promh Temple, and Bayon Temple. This was basically the best experience that we had in the entire tri-country trip. Just watching the sun envelope Angkor Wat with its light in the early hours of the morning was definitely a core memory made. Joining a group tour with a tour guide was definitely the best choice for us since the tour guide was really amazing at their job and the other joiners were fun too! We were really blessed with an amazing tour guide who was very friendly, knowledgeable, and fun. The entire experience was great and comfortable despite the heat since they took care of us well. They gave us ice-cold bottles of water and cold face towels after each temple which we never expected. The tour guide also took a lot of our pictures since he knows all the best spots. He also sent the pics he took of us from his phone to each of our whatsapp accounts. He really was amazing!

Bangkok üáπüá≠
We saved the most fast-paced city out of the three at the end of the trip which was a good choice for us. Our trip in Bangkok mostly centered around visiting temples, shopping, and food trips. Our Temple Day Tour was pretty hectic and draining mostly because of the heat. However, it was still an amazing experience.

Bangkok really has a lot of things to offer especially in shopping and mall culture. Platinum Mall itself would probably take a whole day to see everything. You can also see how creative the Thai people are based on the things that they create and sell, you can really tell how much their art culture is thriving. Their cuisine is also on a different level. I don‚Äôt think the Thai food sold in the PH can match the flavors that we can taste in Thailand. It‚Äôs that amazing.

A city as busy as Bangkok also has its cons such as traffic. This was basically the reason why we missed the river cruise dinner buffet that we booked. So please don‚Äôt make make the same mistake as us and underestimate the traffic! Grab prices are also reasonable too, especially Bolt.

FAQs

Immigration experience at NAIA for tri-country trip:
Docs asked from IO:
- Roundtrip ticket (MNL-SGN & BKK-MNL)
- Accommodations
- Bus Transfers
- Attractions
- COE
- PRINTED Itinerary (IO said to print the itinerary next time since I only gave her my phone lol)
*Make sure that your itinerary is backed by the bookings you presented
** Please take note that both travellers have multiple international trips in the past

Bus transfer bookings:
HCM to PP - Phuong Heng (booked at Klook) with free water
PP to SR - Larryta Express (sleeper bus booked at 12go.asia or larrytabus.com) with free water, toothbrush & toothpaste, very clean and private cabin, cold but their blanket is cozy enough, has outlets, restroom is also very clean. Highly recommended!!!
SR to BKK - Grand Ibis (booked at 12go.asia) with free lunch!

Cross-border immigration process:
HCM to PP: for SEA nationals, the bus conductors will take your passport and will be the one to process at the border. Just follow them and wait for their instructions.
SR to BKK - you will process and go through an immigration officer yourself at the border. Bus conductor will still guide you!
* this is based on our experience. Other bus services might have a different process

Wifi/Simcard:
We opted for wifi instead, valid for all three countries. Booked the wifi at Klook and claimed inside NAIA T3 after immigration.
 
Transportation:
HCM: Mostly Grabcar and walking
SR: Grabtuktuk and walking
BKK: Mostly Grabcar and Bolt (Only tried Tuktuk once since it‚Äôs overpriced)

Safety:
HCM: felt very safe, can use the phone outside, the fast motorcycles were the only scary factor
SR: felt safe, also used my phone outside, walked alone at night and still felt safe!
BKK: safety is probably medium, very vigilant since there‚Äôs a lot of people
*Please take note to always still be vigilant even when you feel safe!
** FYI we‚Äôre only two girls alone on the trip

Weather:
June weather for the three cities is supposed to be rainy. However, we were lucky enough that it only rained once in our entire trip which pretty much was the evening of our last day in HCM.

Budget:
Spent 60K per pax all-in for the entire trip. Please take note that we didn‚Äôt buy our airfare during seatsales and we spent airfare to and from Cebu.

Tips:
1. Plan the order of your trip well. We opted to have BKK last since we‚Äôll be doing a lot of shopping and we wanted to travel light through the bus transfers.
2. Bring back-up USD if possible. The ATMs might not be functioning and you can have the USD exchanged instead. Cambodia also accepts USD and will either give Riel or USD as change. Just make sure to take a picture of big USD bills before paying to avoid scams.
3. If you want to explore Phnom Penh while waiting for your overnight trip to SR, you can leave your bags at the Bus Provider‚Äôs office (Larryta offers this, not sure with other providers)
4. When transferring from one country to another, always bring some toiletries in your carry-on (face wash, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.) It will be a really big help.
5. Always make sure to count your bills well when paying. Dong and Riel currencies are very confusing!!!!
6. Bring lightweight clothes as much as possible since these cities are extremely hot and humid. Bring portable fans, and deo as well. Make sure you keep yourself hydrated.
7. Always bring meds just to be safe. Erceflora is a must-bring!
8. Bring eco bags especially if you‚Äôll be doing a lot of shopping
9. Please always do research on scams in order to avoid those.
10.Pasalubong: 
HCM: we mostly bought souvenirs at the Saigon Post Office and Book Street since Ben Thanh was not introvert-friendly. For supermarket, Co-op Mart is highly recommended. We got Vietnam coffee grounds and instant coffee as well at Trung Nguyen Legend.
SR: Old Market
BKK: Souvenirs at Pratunam Night Market, Platinum Mall, Asiatique Riverfront, and ICONSIAM. For supermarket, we went to Big C Super Center.

Hopefully, this will be helpful to those who want to give the tri-country Indochina trip a try! Thanks!

I didn't think about it much but would realize this later when i was travelling to another country via london transit where i got to stay overnight before my connecting flight

  
so, i went to a carribean country for couple of weeks and during return had to stop in london. I booked a hotel in the area which i got familiar during the previous stay (closer to the train station). After taking train from airport and reaching the area where i booked the hotel. I thought i will walk with my luggage (didn't want to spend high on cab & i generally like walking to burn calories)... However, midway i felt really tired. Not sure if was becoz i was unable to find the hotel or i was tired with the long flight... As i was close to the hotel, i took the underpass to cross the road and i saw a mid 50 YO aunty who saw me and asked if i needed help on stairs with the luggage. i replied that i can manage... I could see that the aunty was from India and i asked for the directions to which she politely explained how to reach the hotel ( in new places, i feel even if you are right in front of a location, you may not actually locate.. also, london places don't unnecessarily put hoarding/displays).. I then asked aunty to help me find a good vegetarian restaurant. Aunty said she is going to the supermarket and she'll get me sandwich and give it at the reception.. to this, i politely denied since i didn't want to trouble her... but she insisted and later offered that she will bring sandwiches from her home which was right opposite the hotel. She went back to collect it and bring it to the reception where i was waiting...

till she returned, i pulled coffee bottle which i purchased earlier at the airport ( i wanted to return the favour). aunty brought sandwiches and some snacks... She later helped me find the nearest clothing store ( i wanted to buy some for my family)..  
In this moment i realised how this gesture is gonna change me foreover.. it made be feel really blessed.. being a stranger, she still help me... 

I came back and told this to almost everyone in my circle especially my manager..... I now kind of think of always helping someone with food (i started consciously doing this, it really feels amazing to do so!)",2,1737451931.0,wholesomestories,0,1.0,False

Now Aubrey hadn't exactly grown up rich, but coffee was one thing she refused to compromise on. It was her lifeblood, the thing that sustained her on late nights when inspiration hit her at 3AM. Even when they were on the streets she'd asked Scarlett to steal some decent coffee for her.

Was she addicted? Nah. She could stop whenever she wanted.

And after she'd managed to get her hands on some decent coffee at last, she felt pity for her fellow campmates, that they had to swallow down the dirtwater at Camp that she was half convinced was decaf. So, she decided to be charitable.

Near the centre of the Cabin Area, not far from the Anemoi Cabin Aubrey set up a table with a lacy white tablecloth and her coffee supplies on top, which included the beans, grinder, aeropress, some water, milk, sugar and some spices she'd snuck out of the Camp Kitchen and some cups. There were some chairs set up in front of her table, and a chalkboard read ""CHB Caf√©"" in messy handwriting on top.

She'd considered doing it for free but it hadn't taken her long to realise that that would be a bad business strategy. If this was popular enough to become a recurring thing, she'd need to restock and that would require money. Somehow she wasn't sure if Rex would continue his charitability and keep giving her coffee supplies for free if she kept putting out jobs- actually maybe if she heeded his request and refused to serve Jaime. Hmm. She still had to decide that.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caff√® Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the Christmas special Millionaire hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Was doing all that typical SEO crap - keyword research for hours, optimizing everything to death, reading every ""expert"" guide out there. Traffic stuck at 6k/month. Frustrating af.



My friend basically called me an idiot over coffee (thanks Nick), but he had a point. I was wasting time trying to game the system instead of just... writing stuff.



So I tried an experiment:



Stopped giving a shit about keyword volume

Wrote about what I actually knew (Fiverr stuff)

Posted regularly instead of ""when it's perfect""

Traffic hit 26k/month. Yeah, I was surprised too.



The dumb part? Wasted money on AI writers thinking they'd solve everything. Spoiler: they didn't. Every AI post flopped compared to my normal ones. Should've known better.



What ended up working:



Just writing regularly (once a week)

Actually knowing what I'm talking about

Not trying to stuff keywords everywhere like an idiot

That's it. No secret sauce. No 200 IQ plays. Just stopped trying to outsmart Google and wrote stuff people might actually want to read.

But after yesterday's date night I have been somewhat feeling attached and inclined towards him, I have been waiting for his messages more, and I have been wanting to hear from him how did he like me ! He was too sweet, he bought me a huge flowers bouquet, a chocolate, a pine cone from his hometown, a gajra (a flower adornment which Indian woman wear to complement it with traditional attire on their hair or hairbun as it also decorates the hair, looks aesthetic af and smells like heaven, they are made with jasmine, tuberose or other such flowers), it was very thoughful of him, I mean no man I dated before has given me flowers, I even had to ask for flowers to one of them (you see, so pathetic!)

We went to a cafe suggested by me, which was inside a bookstore, and it was so aesthetic and warm. I ordered him coffee as he was confused. He also bought a book from that book store for me, there wasn't any discount and I prevented him from doing so still he bought it, it was Khalil Gibran's The Prophet, he insisted me to read it. He once or twice flirted with me playfully. He didn't specifically gave me compliments though. It went beyong my imagination. I was happy. and yes he also drove for 1 and half hrs to pick me up from my location then we went to a cafe, he drove again for 35 minutes and then he dropped me back to my place, and then he had to drive back to his home again for 1 hours. Omg it was so hectic for him, I apologised to him a lot for such pain, but he sweetly said that it's nothing, guys do more than these things for their girls. It's since then I am feeling inclined towards him, nobody in this eternity has treated me so kindly, I know I should not be in rush but I really want to know his feelings about me, also I am pretty anxious that what if everything is just a fleeting moment, what if everything goes wrong like before, what if he is just nice with everyone and I am not the only one.

1i6eqv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoItaly/comments/1i6eqv7/understanding_italian_coffee_culture_ordering/,Understanding Italian coffee culture: Ordering like a local.,"## Understanding Italian Coffee Culture: Ordering Like a Local

Italy. The land of art, history, and‚Ä¶ incredible coffee!  But navigating Italian coffee culture can feel like entering a secret society if you're not in the know. Fear not, fellow coffee lover! This guide will help you order your perfect caffeinated pick-me-up like a true Italian.

**Forget the ""Venti Caramel Frappuccino"" ‚Äì This Ain't Starbucks!**

In Italy, coffee is a ritual, a quick burst of energy, a social lubricant. It's not a sugary, elaborate experience. Forget the long lists of customizable options; Italian coffee is typically simple, strong, and served quickly.  Think espresso-based drinks and delicious pastries.

**The Essential Vocabulary:**

Knowing a few key words will make all the difference:

* **Caff√®:** This is your basic espresso.  Short, strong, and perfect.
* **Caff√® macchiato:** A caff√® with a dollop of foamed milk.  Think espresso with a spot of milk.
* **Caff√® latte:**  Espresso with steamed milk.  Note: this is *not* the giant, milky drink you might be used to. It's smaller and still emphasizes the espresso.
* **Cappuccino:** Espresso with steamed milk and foamed milk.  Traditionally only enjoyed in the morning.
* **Corretto:** Espresso with a shot of liquor (usually Sambuca or Grappa).  A little something extra for the adventurous!

**Where to Order (and What to Expect):**

You‚Äôll find amazing coffee everywhere in Italy, from tiny hole-in-the-wall bars to grand cafes. Don‚Äôt expect cozy armchairs and extended lounging; these places are designed for quick service.

* **Standing at the bar:**  Ordering at the bar (il banco) is the standard and usually cheaper.
* **Seated at a table:** You'll pay a little more for table service (servizio al tavolo).
* **The ""quick coffee"" mentality:** Italians are all about efficiency. Be prepared to order quickly and politely.

**Tips for a Smooth Coffee Experience:**

* **""Un caff√®, per favore""**: This simple phrase will get you a standard espresso.
* **Point and gesture:**  If you're feeling unsure, pointing at a pastry or drink displayed can help.
* **Sweeteners are usually self-serve:**  Sugar is typically provided in small packets or a bowl at the counter.
* **Enjoy your coffee!** It‚Äôs the simple pleasures that make Italy special, and a perfect espresso is one of them.

**Beyond the Basics:**

Once you‚Äôve mastered the essentials, you can explore regional variations and other delightful drinks. But for your first foray into Italian coffee culture, these basics will make you feel like a local in no time.

So, ditch the complicated orders and embrace the simplicity of Italian coffee.  Enjoy the rich flavour, the quick service, and the authentic experience ‚Äì you won't regret it! Buon caff√®!

I‚Äôm a 25F living in Orange County, CA. I split a one bedroom apartment with my boyfriend (29M) and I have anxiety attacks regularly just thinking about our/my finances. Our direct circle of friends live at home with their parents paying minimal bills so they can‚Äôt really relate to our situation which is why I‚Äôm turning to Reddit. 

We rent an apartment that takes majority of our checks and our combined income is like $140K pre-taxes. Total cost for the apartment is about $3,100/month. Living with family is not an option and I don‚Äôt spend my checks recklessly. Can‚Äôt say the same for my boyfriend, but that‚Äôs another story. He does, however, split living costs with me. For my checks, it all goes to groceries, credit card bills, rent, and a very small amount for freewill spending. ‚ÄúFree-will spending‚Äù usually means cheap eats, boba/coffee, and sometimes new clothes. Savings is nonexistent for me. Luckily through my work I have saving plans, but from checks I receive it all gets spent. 

With everything getting so expensive, it‚Äôs getting more difficult to keep up and I have no idea what to do. I literally have days where I breakdown crying just because I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe. My boyfriend already works 2 jobs (1 part-time and 1 full-time) and I got a promotion in June 2024 (full-time), so don‚Äôt anticipate seeing another raise soon. I‚Äôm contemplating getting a part-time job too. I‚Äôd prefer not to because I feel like I‚Äôd be putting my mental/physical health last along with my relationship. We barely see each other as is with his schedule. He works Monday through Saturdays from 5AM-6PM depending on the day of the week. I work from home Monday through Fridays 9AM-6PM. 

Long story short, is it pretty normal for people in SoCal/CA our age to be living paycheck-to-paycheck? Any financial advice to make my paychecks go longer? Advice for apartment living options that may be cheaper? Any advice may help and I‚Äôm all ears. Thank you in advance Reddit. ",1,1737450820.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

My daughter (3 and a half) asked for toast this morning, so I started making us both some toast. She said she wanted Nutella, so I start spreading the Nutella and then she comes over and says I don't want chocolate, I want honey. 

So I was like, fine, I haven't put anything on my toast yet, I'll have your Nutella slice. So, I put honey on the other slice, put it on her plate, and we both sat down with our toast. Cue her ""i don't want honey i want chocolate"" so I said ""I already swapped, you wanted honey and that is what i have made for you"" and she started crying, she doesn't want it, she wants chocolate. So I swapped. I just wanted to eat some toast, and i didn't care what was on it at this point. 

This happens sometimes when we are colouring in and she wants to swap but I have already started colouring a page, in that case I say that I have chosen my page and she has chosen hers, and this is how we share by having one each. If she insists on colouring mine I might put the books away, because I feel like otherwise I'm not teaching her to share appropriately. 

At breakfast I didn't want to waste the toast and/or make more, I just wanted to eat! 

How should I/could I deal with this situation? Is it wrong of me if in future I say, that is the choice you made, then if she doesn't eat it she might go hungry? That doesn't feel right either!  ",2,1737450533.0,gentleparenting,1,1.0,False

E[merald Village](https://wehotimes.com/emerald-village-welcomes-football-fans-to-weho-with-new-its-always-bowl-season-campaign/)¬†West Hollywood, a coalition of cannabis businesses, has launched several initiatives aimed at helping those affected by the Palisades Eaton and Palisades Fires, particularly medical cannabis patients facing unique challenges in emergency housing and shelters.

# Relief for Medical Cannabis Patients

Emerald Village members are offering special accommodations for medical cannabis patients who have been displaced by the fires.

* **Free Lounge Access**: Cannabis consumption lounges, including The Artist Tree and The Woods WeHo, are waiving cover charges and minimum purchase requirements for evacuees aged 21 and over.
* **Medical Discounts**: Dispensaries like The Artist Tree and The Woods WeHo are extending West Hollywood‚Äôs medical patient discount program to evacuees from affected ZIP codes.

* **Donation Matching Campaign**: The Artist Tree has launched ‚ÄúPainting a Path to Recovery,‚Äù pledging to match donations up to $25,000 for the California Community Foundation‚Äôs Wildfire Relief Fund.
* **Donations of Essentials**: The Woods WeHo is collecting clothing and non-perishable items for fire victims. Customers affected by the fires can also take advantage of a $1 BOGO deal on select products, while first responders are offered free non-infused coffee and pastries in the lounge‚Äôs non-smoking areas.

# Device and Accessory Drive

Emerald Village, in partnership with Los Angeles NORML, is organizing a device and accessory drive to replace items evacuees left behind. The initiative kicks off with a donation drop-off event on¬†**January 23, 2025**, from¬†**5:00 PM to 9:00 PM**¬†at Baja Cantina in Venice Beach.

1i6ek8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaidOnlineJobs/comments/1i6ek8n/home_staging_decor_kitchen/,Home Staging Decor Kitchen,"The Impact of Home Staging Decor in the Kitchen: Transforming Spaces for Better Sales
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Home staging decor plays a crucial role in the kitchen, a space that often serves as the heart of a home. When potential buyers step into a well-staged kitchen, they can envision themselves cooking meals, sharing stories, and creating memories. A properly decorated kitchen creates a welcoming atmosphere, making it easier to sell a home quickly and at a better price.

Understanding the impact of staging decor in the kitchen can change how you approach selling your home. Here are some essential strategies you can implement to enhance the appeal of your kitchen:

- **Clear Clutter:** A clean kitchen allows buyers to focus on the space itself. Start by removing personal items, excessive appliances, and any unnecessary decor. Aim for a minimalist look that highlights the kitchen's features.
- **Choose Neutral Colors:** Use soft, neutral colors for wall paint and decor. Light hues create an illusion of space and help potential buyers imagine their own color schemes without distraction.
- **Highlight Key Features:** If your kitchen has unique features such as custom cabinetry or high-end appliances, let these take center stage. You can do this by ensuring they are clean and well-maintained, allowing buyers to appreciate their value.
- **Add Functional Decor:** Consider using decorative items that also offer functionality. Attractive cutting boards, stylish dishware, and decorative jars can serve as decor while enhancing the kitchen's usability.
- **Use Lighting Wisely:** Good lighting is vital. Ensure all bulbs are working and consider adding under-cabinet lighting or pendant lights to brighten the space. A well-lit kitchen feels more inviting.
- **Showcase Open Space:** Arrange furniture to maximize open space. Remove any unnecessary items that may block walkways, creating a flow that feels spacious and airy.
- **Introduce Fresh Elements:** Add some greenery with small potted herbs or flowers. Plants bring life to the kitchen without overwhelming the decor, giving it an inviting touch.

Another tip is to set the dining area within the kitchen to demonstrate how the space can be used for gatherings. Adding a sleek table with stylish chairs can create an ideal setup for entertaining. This helps buyers picture the kitchen as a place for both cooking and connecting with family and friends.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-decor-kitchen  
  
When it comes to decor, don't forget the balance between personality and neutrality. While you want to make the kitchen visually appealing, it‚Äôs essential that the decor doesn't reflect your taste too heavily. Buyers seek spaces they can personalize, so a neutral approach is more effective.

If you have an island or breakfast nook, consider dressing those areas with some curated kitchen accessories or simple table settings. For instance:

In addition, it is essential to ensure that the kitchen smells pleasant. A neutral or refreshing scent can leave a good impression on potential buyers. Simple solutions like fresh coffee, baked cookies, or cinnamon can evoke warmth and comfort.

These elements can significantly impact how modern and well-maintained your kitchen appears. Remember, buyers often check these areas, and addressing them can be the difference in sealing the deal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Brighten Up with Light Colors

Using light colors can make your kitchen feel larger and more welcoming. Shades like soft whites, pale yellows, and light grays can create a bright atmosphere. Consider painting cabinets or adding a fresh coat of paint to the walls. This will help highlight your kitchen's features and draw attention to its best aspects.

### Declutter and Organize

Before you start decorating, it‚Äôs essential to declutter. A clean kitchen appears more spacious. Here‚Äôs how to keep it organized:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Remove Personal Items:** Take away family photos and personal mementos. You want buyers to envision themselves in the space.
- **Store Small Appliances:** Hide away toasters, blenders, and other gadgets. Only keep out the essentials.
- **Organize Cabinets:** Neatly arrange dishes and cookware. This shows that the kitchen has ample storage.

### Focus on Functional Decor

When picking decor, choose items that serve a purpose while also looking good. For example:

- **Clever Storage Solutions:** Use stylish baskets or decorative boxes for storage. This adds character and keeps things tidy.
- **Herb Planters:** Fresh herbs can bring color and life to your kitchen. Choose simple pots for a clean look.
- **Stylish Cookware:** Display quality pots and pans on open shelves. This not only showcases your cooking style but also adds an engaging visual element.

### Add a Touch of Greenery

Plants can improve the ambiance of your kitchen. Here are some easy options:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Small Potted Plants:** Choose herbs like basil or mint for practicality and style.
- **Flower Arrangements:** Fresh flowers can enhance the decor. Just make sure they aren't overpowering.
- **Low-Maintenance Options:** If you're not a plant person, consider artificial plants that look realistic.

### Upgrade Fixtures and Hardware

Small updates can make a huge difference. Swapping out old cabinet knobs or faucet fixtures for modern designs can rejuvenate the space. Opt for finishes such as brushed nickel or matte black, as they are trending and sophisticated.

### Utilize Textiles Wisely

Textiles can soften the hard surfaces in a kitchen. Here are a few suggestions on how to effectively use textiles:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Fresh Towels:** Use colorful dish towels that match your kitchen's color scheme.
- **Rug Placement:** A simple rug can add warmth but ensure it‚Äôs washable and placed in a low-traffic area to prevent wear.

### Keep It Simple with Minimal Accessories

A cluttered countertop can deter buyers. Keep accessories to a minimum. For example, use a single stylish cutting board or a bowl of fresh fruit as a centerpiece. This will keep the focus on the kitchen's features while enhancing visual appeal.

### Consider Lighting Options

Good lighting can transform your kitchen's atmosphere. Here‚Äôs how to improve it:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-staging-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Natural Light:** Make sure window treatments allow maximum sunlight.
- **Strategic Lighting:** Layer lighting by adding under-cabinet lighting or pendant lights over dining areas.

When staging your kitchen for sale, remember that simplicity and functionality are key. A well-decorated kitchen not only attracts buyers but also adds to the overall value of your home. Choose decor that enhances the space and invites potential buyers to imagine their lives in your beautiful kitchen.

By integrating these strategies into your home staging, you can create an inviting atmosphere that will leave a lasting impression.

### Conclusion

The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home, making it a vital space to focus on when staging your house for sale. The impact of home staging decor in the kitchen can be profound, transforming an ordinary space into an inviting one that captures potential buyers' attention. By highlighting the functionality and style of this key area, you can significantly improve your chances of making a quick and profitable sale.

1i6ehsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i6ehsj/aita_for_expressing_sadness_to_my_husband_about/,AITA for expressing sadness to my husband about the distant relationship I have with my stepdaughter?,"I met my husband 21 years ago. He was a young widower with a daughter who was 8 at the time and his wife had passed two years prior. We started a friendship that became something more. We married when my stepdaughter was 11 and we had three children together when she was a teenager. My relationship with my stepdaughter was never perfect. It was never how you see happy endings between a child and their new stepparent play out on TV. But it wasn't in any way crazy bad either. Looking back I can see she tolerated me but never truly accepted me as a stepmom or even as a friend. At the time I believed she was being a teen who wasn't going to be overly close to the new stepmom. But I figured in time we might develop a nice friendship.

I have come to realize I will forever be tolerated but she will never want a relationship with me independent of her dad. There are many times I have asked her out for coffee, or lunch, or attempted to meet up with her to spend some time together and she always said she was busy. She did have time to meet with her dad for some 1:1 time. That was never something she was too busy for. Eventually I did stop asking because she was an adult with her own life and she was making it clear without being rude. I admit it hurt but I wasn't ever the kind of person to force myself on someone else.

I felt the distance more when she got married. She and her husband had lots of photos taken that day but a point was made to get solo photos with the bride and then the groom with each of their closest family members consisting of her dad, her MIL, her FIL, her FILs wife, her maternal grandmother and grandfather, paternal grandfather and her GMIL. I didn't get a solo photo with either bride or groom. Of course there were others present who didn't either. But the fact the grooms stepmom was included and I was not did stand out to me. I understand it was her wedding day and her husband is clearly closer to his stepmom than she is to me, but I felt it. I also wasn't mentioned in the toast they made. My husband noticed that where he didn't with the photo and I explained they may have forgot to mention me.

Recently my stepdaughter had asked my husband if he wanted and was able to babysit her two young children for her so she could attend a hospital appointment. My husband was working that day and he told her but he mentioned I was able and willing, which I was. I told her I was happy to help. But suddenly it was okay and someone else she had asked had informed her they could do it. I found out she ended up rescheduling the appointment so her husband could be off work and stay with the kids. It was so clear to me that she didn't want me to spend that time with her kids. I have never been allowed time with her kids the way my husband has. Of course there are times he has them and I see them then. But he'll ask for a grandpa day and there's never any problem but even in an emergency I could not watch them alone.

My hurt intensified after learning about her rescheduling the hospital appointment instead of letting me babysit for her. I confided in my husband about my hurt feelings about the distance in our relationship. I told him I didn't want it to be forced but I had hoped after this long we could be on better terms. I asked him not to say anything to her, but he did, and he asked her why she treated me the way she does. He apparently hadn't noticed everything. Some stuff but he believed she was busy when I'd asked and bought the line I said at the wedding about simply forgetting to mention me. He told her it seemed very over the top to not let me watch the kids so she could see her doctor. She said she didn't want her kids growing up thinking of me as their grandma so the less time they had with me the happier she is. She said she didn't see the problem with her not wanting a relationship with me. She also accused me of being unstable when I confided in my husband about it instead of accepting it and getting over it.

I believed I was fully accepting before this but I have decided to seek therapy to see if it can help me become more okay with it. But now I'm left second guessing my decision to confide in him.

Verification is a must and we like to meet casually first over drinks or coffee. The vide matters and is of importance. We are straight as an arrow and not at all bi-curious. 

We like to watch and love when being watched. We wish to connect with couples for SRSP and with single females too who will like to watch us. Though, we wouldn‚Äôt engage with the female in any physical activity as we are not looking for a threesome (FFM), but will love to see the woman getting aroused and playing with herself watching us.

1i6edtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrakashamParakkatte/comments/1i6edtn/chapter_1_the_ecosystem_of_kuchu/,Chapter 1: The Ecosystem of Kuchu,"I am a research scientist, a man who has built a career on the cold logic of neurobiology‚Äîthe mapping of neurons, the chemistry of cognition. Yet my most profound study resides not in a lab, but in the quiet, tangled symbiosis I share with a creature named Kuchu. A black Persian cat, rescued years ago from a cardboard box on a rain-slicked street corner. He was the last of his litter, a pitch-black fluff ball dismissed by superstitious passersby.¬†*Bad luck*, they muttered, avoiding his cage. But when I crouched to look, his eyes locked onto mine‚Äîgolden, unblinking, electric with a plea that bypassed language. I handed over cash without haggling. We‚Äôve been deciphering each other ever since.

Our mornings begin before dawn. When he was a kitten, I carried him in a sling during my jogs, his tiny claws pricking my collarbone like Morse code. Now, he is the one who wakes¬†*me*, batting my cheek with a velvet paw until I lace up my shoes. Together, we walk the mist-draped streets, Kuchu trotting ahead like a panther surveying conquered land. He feigns courage, but when unfamiliar noises rustle the bushes‚Äîa raccoon, a stray‚Äîhe presses against my leg, a silent command to stay close. Children sometimes skitter toward us, drawn by his glossy fur, only to retreat when he hisses, a sound like steam escaping a kettle. Their parents call him ‚Äúdevilish,‚Äù but I‚Äôve seen him nudge his head under the palm of the girl next door, a quiet child who whispers to him in syllables softer than birdsong. He tolerates what he deems worthy. The rest, he dismisses.

The house is our shared theorem. Kuchu lounges on the highest bookshelf, a sphinx judging my routines: the clatter of lab reports, the sigh of the coffee maker, the occasional cracks in my composure. When professional setbacks pile up‚Äîgrants denied, hypotheses disproven‚Äîor when the loneliness of suburban solitude presses too sharply, he descends. Not to console, but to¬†*correct*. He knocks my pen from the desk, steals my chair, or stations himself on the keyboard, his body a warm, grounding weight. His affection is algorithmic, predictable only to me. He allows exactly three pats before flicking his tail in warning. He sleeps at the foot of my bed but never on it, as though guarding me from dreams.

His territoriality is legendary. Delivery workers quicken their steps past our gate. Once, a pack of carolers fled mid-verse when he erupted into a yowling aria from the porch. Yet he permits the elderly widow next door to deadhead my roses, watching her through half-closed eyes. He tolerates sparrows bathing in his water dish and no longer chases squirrels, though I catch him tracking their leaps with a veteran‚Äôs glare. Age has made him a diplomat‚Äîor perhaps a tactician.

Which is why I should have anticipated the fallout when I brought home the dog.

It was an impulse steeped in empathy, not logic. A neighbor, abandoning his terrier mix before relocating, had left the creature shivering in a cardboard crate‚Äîa mirror of Kuchu‚Äôs origin. The puppy was all tousled white fur and desperate licks, a sunbeam to Kuchu‚Äôs thundercloud.¬†*They‚Äôll balance each other*, I reasoned.¬†*A companion for him, a project for me*.

I forgot that Kuchu does not believe in balance. Only territory.

When I carried the trembling dog‚ÄîWikki‚Äîinto the house, Kuchu‚Äôs eyes darkened. He vanished into the garden, a shadow dissolving into shadows. That night, as Wikki snuffled at his food bowl, I glimpsed Kuchu perched on the fence, staring in. Not angry.¬†*Betrayed*.

Our ecosystem, it seemed, had always been a equation of two. I‚Äôd added a variable without consent.

Now, the solution would require more than logic",1,1737449335.0,PrakashamParakkatte,0,1.0,False

I have been poly for 6+ years now, he is new to it but has friends who are poly and non-monogamous so it isn't a new concept to him. I am married to Alan(44M) and it's all going well from that perspective, we hang out at my house a good amount and my kids and Alan like Tom. So far so great. 

We have had many conversations about polyamory and what that would look like for us. Tom has been chatting with a few people and went on a lovely coffee date last week but he is having a wobble about it all. We are both recently out of relationships that affected us deeply and we are doing a lot of work individually on ourselves. After more talking and being vulnerable we have both decided to put dating other people on pause, this was very much an ""us"" decision as opposed to someone asking for it. This doesn't affect my relationship with Alan. 

I am happy with this decision, *and* I am feeling a gentle nervousness as I didn't date in my last 2 year relationship. I don't want to go back to being essentially monogamous with two partners. I really don't think Tom wants that either and our relationship is truly so good, we communicate so well and really hear each other. 

I'm wondering if anyone has experience of a pause at the beginning of a relationship, before opening back up together, has worked for them? Would love to hear your stories. 

Tom is reading the books and asking the hypothetical questions, so there is ground work being done between us. So much talking! But I am nervous about the opening up after.

I did feel an effect the first 3 days, not much but task initiation , concentration worked better and the constant seeking dopamine (coffee/snacks,..) was reduced while the meds lasted. I didn't feel an effect the following days and was looking forward to week two. Though on day one of 20mg I didn't feel any effect at all. I think it was one if the stronger symptom days. Also the side effect of headdache I had in the first days but none on the first higher dose day. 
So I'm wondering... Habituation at this point seems unlikely.. (different opinions?) and of course it could be I generally respond to higher doses, but then why did I feel an effect in day 1-3..

1i6e6nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1i6e6nj/what_supplement_has_been_most_effective_for_you/,What supplement has been most effective for you for lowering Stress/Cortisol?,"I'm having a couple of the most stressful weeks of my life and A LOT of people get stressed during the holidays, not just myself. Even on days where I'm not so stressed, my cortisol always seems to spike at night for some reason, causing my heart and mind to race, and very much preventing/disrupting sleep.

What supplement or nootropic has been most effective for you in reducing stress/cortisol?

The answer will be different for everyone, as we all react differently. For example, two of the most commonly mentioned supplements for stress/anxiety reduction would be Ashwagandha or L-Theanine. However Ashwagandha can have nasty effects on certain people (depression/anhedonia), which scares me, even though I've tried it in the past (there is also KSM-66 and sensoril versions of ash). And L-theanine is different from person to person as well (I've gone through a few different bottles/brands over the years, but never really noticed anything, maybe it just has no effect on me). I do take modafinil with mexican coffee from modafinia though sometimes.

Primarily my cortisol seems to spike most at night, oddly enough, when I'm exhausted and trying to sleep. Bad timing for my heart to start racing. I hate laying in bed with my heart and mind racing.

I have been taking Rhodiola Rosea recently, but still unsure on it. I suspect it's increasing my heart rate, which is uncomfortable as I'm already stressed out. I haven't found black seed oil to be super helpful, but seems okay.

I am thinking about ordering some Phosphatidylserine to give that a try, but I've heard mixed things, like anything else I suppose.

So what have you found to work best for you?

Cardio, Weightlifting, Diet, and Good sleep are all key, as always, but I can't get good sleep if I'm stressed, and if I don't sleep I'm even more stressed, so it's a terrible cycle.",19,1737448410.0,Biohackers,18,1.0,False

1i6e3uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1i6e3uf/i_replaced_social_media_with_microlearning_for_30/,I replaced social media with 'micro-learning' for 30 days - Here's how it transformed my productivity,"Hey r/productivity! I wanted to share an experiment I tried recently that honestly changed my relationship with time-wasting and learning.

Like many of you, I used to mindlessly scroll through social media whenever I had a few spare minutes - waiting for coffee, on the bus, or even (embarrassingly) on the toilet. One day, I calculated I was spending about 2.5 hours daily just... scrolling.

So I decided to try something different: replacing every social media urge with a 5-10 minute learning session. Here's what I did:

**My Setup:**

* Deleted social apps from my phone
* Downloaded: Duolingo, Brilliant, and a Kindle app
* Bookmarked some educational Yt channels
* Installed Pocket for saving interesting articles

**What I learned in 30 days:**

* Basic conversational Spanish (15-20 phrases I can actually use)
* Finally understood how compound interest actually works
* Basics of stock market and investing
* Read 2 full books in ""bite-sized"" chunks
* Learned to solve a Rubik's cube (via short yt tutorials)

**The Unexpected Benefits:**

1. Better sleep - no more late-night scrolling
2. Reduced anxiety - less FOMO, more actual accomplishment
3. Better conversations - I actually had interesting things to share
4. Increased focus - my attention span noticeably improved

**The Challenges:**

* First week was HARD. My thumb literally twitched for Instagram
* Had to fight the urge to turn learning into another mindless activity
* Sometimes felt disconnected from friends' daily updates
* Needed to actively plan what I wanted to learn

**Tips if you want to try:**

* Start with topics you're genuinely curious about
* Keep learning sessions under 10 minutes
* Have multiple options ready (different apps/materials)
* Don't beat yourself up if you slip up

The biggest surprise? After 30 days, I didn't even want to go back to my old social media habits. I still use them, but now it's intentional and limited.

**TLDR:** Replaced mindless scrolling with mini-learning sessions. Learned actual skills, felt more productive, and broke my social media addiction.

1i6e1w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i6e1w3/the_ultimate_rug_size_guide_getting_the/,The Ultimate Rug Size Guide: Getting the Dimensions Right,"Choosing the right rug size is just as important as selecting the perfect design. A rug that's too small can make your space feel disjointed, while one that's too large might overwhelm the room. Whether you're looking for [grey rugs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/etienne-rug-grey) decor or want to incorporate a statement piece like [blue and white rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/blue-and-white-rug), this guide will help you get the dimensions just right.

**Why Rug Size Matters**

The size of your rug can define the space, balance your furniture, and create visual harmony. A well-proportioned rug anchors the room, ensuring that all elements come together seamlessly. To help you make the best choice, let‚Äôs break it down room by room.

**Living Room**

**Key Consideration:** The rug should anchor your seating area. It‚Äôs a good idea to ensure that at least the front legs of your furniture rest on the rug.

* **Large Rugs for Living Room:** If you have a spacious living room, opt for a rug that extends under all the furniture, including sofas, chairs, and the coffee table. [Large rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) create a luxurious, cohesive feel, especially in open-plan spaces.
* **Smaller Spaces:** For compact living rooms, a 5x8 or 6x9 rug might suffice, covering the main seating area without overwhelming the room.

**Popular Styles:**

* **Grey rugs for living room:** These neutral-toned rugs add subtle elegance and blend beautifully with a variety of color palettes.
* **Blue and white rugs:** Perfect for a coastal or modern vibe, these rugs inject a pop of color while maintaining a refined look.

**Dining Room**

**Key Consideration:** The rug should be large enough to accommodate the dining table and chairs, even when the chairs are pulled out.

* As a rule of thumb, add at least 24‚Äì30 inches to each side of your dining table to determine the rug size.
* Round dining tables pair well with circular rugs, while rectangular rugs complement elongated tables.

**Design Tip:** For a timeless look, choose a patterned rug like a blue and white rug that hides spills and stains effectively.

**Bedroom**

**Key Consideration:** The rug should frame the bed, adding warmth underfoot.

* **Large Rugs for Bedrooms:** A king-size bed pairs well with a rug measuring at least 8x10 or 9x12, ensuring it extends beyond the bed on all sides.
* For smaller rooms, a runner on each side of the bed or a single large rug placed horizontally under the bed works well.

**Styling Tip:** Neutral options like grey rugs can create a serene ambiance, while bold patterns add personality.

**Entryway**

**Key Consideration:** Your entryway rug should make a statement without obstructing foot traffic.

* Choose a rug that leaves space on all sides‚Äîat least 6‚Äì12 inches between the rug and the walls.
* For narrow entryways, consider a runner rug.

**Practical Tip:** Durable rugs with low-pile materials work best for high-traffic areas.

**Outdoor Spaces**

**Key Consideration:** Outdoor rugs should define your patio or balcony seating areas.

* For larger outdoor setups, consider large rugs that fit all outdoor furniture within the rug‚Äôs boundaries.

**Popular Choice:** Weather-resistant blue and white rugs are a popular option for outdoor spaces, adding a touch of coastal charm.

**Pro Tips for Rug Selection**

1. **Measure First:** Always measure your space before purchasing. Use painter‚Äôs tape to outline the rug size on the floor for a visual preview.
2. **Layer Rugs:** Combine smaller rugs with larger ones to create depth and interest in your design. For instance, layer a grey rug for living room decor over a larger neutral base rug.
3. **Material Matters:** Choose a material that fits your lifestyle. Wool and natural fibers are great for comfort, while synthetic rugs are more durable and stain-resistant.

**Why Choose Rugs for Living Room Styling**

Investing in quality [rugs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) spaces isn‚Äôt just about functionality‚Äîit‚Äôs about elevating your home‚Äôs aesthetic. Whether you‚Äôre drawn to minimalist grey rugs, bold blue and white rugs, or prefer versatile large rugs, the right size and design can completely transform your space.

Take the time to explore your options and find the perfect fit for your room‚Äôs size, layout, and decor style. A well-chosen rug isn‚Äôt just an accessory; it‚Äôs the foundation of great design.

This can last from 6pm-midnight, and it is very difficult to get her to bed. She‚Äôll nap at 7-8ish within that time, we then do bath and feed and she just will not sleep untill midnight. 

This has been going on since 3 weeks and does not seem to be getting better.

1i6dxjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i6dxjg/fn_working_with_spooky/,[FN] Working with Spooky,"Isabelle put down her phone. She‚Äôd never been able to understand how people could spend hours scrolling on those things. Content on social media was always so disappointing. Videos had been unappealing and posts by strangers always seemed like it had been written by idiots.

There was no way to pass the time so she had gotten used to putting her phone down and had in fact enjoyed it. Sometimes the shit on there was just regurgitated content and at other times it was just horrendous opinions. She felt violated just being exposed by it, like it was shoved down her throat and within every orifice and she was being gang banged by stupidity itself. The longer she was online the more stupid she felt. It was hard to stay interested.

She sat in her booth, staring outside, deep in thought. She bit into her sandwich and alternated between its toasted goodness and the coffee she savoured. She savoured this not because of its lack of perfection but from the very notion that she was sitting there doing only just that.

‚ÄúHey Puppy‚Ä¶‚Äù nagged Spooky.

How dare he interrupt, like whatever he had to say was going to be important and not a complete fuck around at all‚Ä¶.

Isabelle abruptly put her cup down and exhaled sharply. She felt her body tense up. Hearing from Spooky was often infuriating.

‚ÄúWhat?!?‚Äù She asked, not even hiding her irritation. She hadn‚Äôt spoken a word but she was as sure as always that he had heard her.

‚ÄúHow come those ones over there are looking at you?‚Äù Queried Spooky.

Isabelle wrinkled her face in confusion and began to look over. She suddenly stops her head before she finishes her turn and quickly looks down as she begins to see the two men in her peripherals, positioned intently at her, like they were speaking and talking about her. It is obvious they are facing her direction and observing. She is a little surprised and now off guard.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù, she says with frustration, looking at Spooky‚Ä¶ or where he might have been. Spooky was just like that stupid invisible friend from that movie ‚ÄúDrop Dead Fred‚Äù. He was a complete fuckwit and she accused him of being a demon a few times. Nothing concerned her more than when he was right.

‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôve noticed me talking to myself?‚Äù She says raising her eyebrows and with a little attitude. They were still looking. Were they waiting for her to notice? Isabelle was completely confused.

‚ÄúObviously‚Ä¶ maybe they like looking?‚Äù Suggests spooky. Isabelle was stunned to silence. This was a terrible place for Spooky to show up. She had hopes to be a regular here and blend in, no spooky shit. She just wanted to enjoy being here. He was ruining it with his commentary.

‚ÄúI dunno. Just drop it alright?‚Äù She pleads silently with the vacant space. 

‚ÄúWhat do you think about that one though?‚Äù Asks Spooky. ‚ÄúDo you like what you see?‚Äù Isabelle couldn‚Äôt see Spooky but she knew which one he meant. The bearded man.

‚ÄúWhat!?! He‚Äôs alright I guess. You happy?‚Äù she glares at the space she was facing. ‚ÄúCan you just leave it all alone? I don‚Äôt know why they stare. I don‚Äôt know them and they don‚Äôt know me. I want to be here. Drop it‚Äù.

‚ÄúOk Puppy‚Äù. He says. 

Spooky can‚Äôt be trusted.

Isabelle went back to the start and went over everything she could remember about the man and anything she could possibly know so far.

She didn‚Äôt come back for several weeks, just in case. ‚ÄúAct normal‚Äù she told herself. 

‚Ä¶ but even when she wasn‚Äôt there Spooky would ask her if she had been thinking about the man.

Isabelle had to go back and find out why this was all going to be important.
