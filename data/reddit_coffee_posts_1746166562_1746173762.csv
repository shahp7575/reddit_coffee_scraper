Me: 23F, certified overthinker, professional confusion-haver about who I'm even attracted to. I’ve fallen deeply for two girls before, but never felt that emotional pull toward any guy. But hey, physical stuff with boys? Sometimes nice. So obviously my brain said: Maybe you just haven't met the right guy.  

Enter: Bumble. Exit: My dignity.  

The first half? Shockingly normal. Coffee. Laughs. Me not tripping over my own feet. I started thinking ""Huh, maybe I can do this dating thing after all.""

Then came The Pivot.  

""Wanna go back to my place?"" he asked, like it was nothing. Like this was just what people do. And me, ever the people-pleaser, said yes because what if this is my only chance? 

His place smelled like bad decisions. He offered me drinks I don't want, weed I'd never touch. When I said no, his face did this thing - like I said I don't use Internet, like I'm a grandma.  

Then. Oh god. Then came The Speech.  

""You're cool, so I'll be honest,"" he said, leaning in like we were conspirators. ""I've slept with... well, let's just say a lot of girls."" Cue wink. Cue me wanting to evaporate into the atmosphere.  

I became a statue. Nodding. Smiling. Screaming internally about how badly I wanted to be literally anywhere else. My brain short-circuited between:  
""Is this normal?""
""Am I the weird one?""
""Why does this feel so... wrong?""  

Here's the brutal truth they don't tell you: A bad date isn't just awkward. It holds up a mirror to every insecurity you've ever had.  

For me? That mirror showed:  
- The way I've never been that girl guys chase after  
- My ""masculine energy"" that apparently isn't what men want  
- The terrifying thought that maybe I'm just... unlovable  

I left feeling hollow. Not because of him - because of what the experience revealed about me. About how desperately I want connection but how ill-equipped I feel to find it.  

Now I'm left wondering:  
- Is dating always this performative?  
- Am I too me for this world?  
- Will I ever find someone who doesn't make me feel like I'm failing at being a woman?  

This wasn't just a bad date. It was an existential crisis wrapped in small talk and bad decisions.  

So tell me, Reddit:  
Have you ever walked away from a date feeling like you were the problem?  
How do you stop one bad experience from rewriting your entire love story?  
And most importantly... does it get better?

When I try to research it, it says it can spike your blood pressure, make you anxious, jittery etc. I don't have those, my blood pressure is always low and I never felt bad from taking both.

But what I did start noticing (and it's probably been happening always, I am just very out of tune with myself until it becomes a problem) is that an hour or so after taking my med and drinking my morning coffee, I get reaallly sleepy and relaxed and my breathing slows down, yawning starts etc. I don't experience meds crashes because I take a slow-release med that lasts 12 hours and the crash wouldn't happen after only an hour - it's when the med starts to kick in actually.

Is this good, bad? Is it a cortisol spike then crash?

Chapter 1

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 

Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.

I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that stupid handmade card on his desk. The one I'd spent hours making, like a fool who still believed in fairy tales.

The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.

My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.

""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""

My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""

""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""

The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. ""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.

""Is there someone else?""

The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""

One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.

""How long?""

""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""

""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped kissing me goodbye in the mornings. ""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""

My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.

""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.

""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.

The world stopped.

I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.

""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""

Stefan's silence said everything.

Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving toasts at our engagement party. Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.

My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at stupid, naive Camille.""

""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""

""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""

Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.

""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""

""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""

""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. ""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""

Blood dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.

""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""

""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""

""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""

I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.

""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""

I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.

""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""

""Where are you going?""

""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""

My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.

I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""

""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""

""Camille, please...""

""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""

""For what?""

""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""

I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bloody fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.

Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.

My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.

Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.

In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, blood stained my dress, my hair had c

ome loose from its perfect twist.

I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.

Chapter 2
Chapter 2

Camille's point of view 

The house was quiet, too quiet. I slipped in through the side door, locking it softly behind me. The air smelled like lemon polish and roses, just like it always did. It felt strange to be back, like stepping into someone else’s life.

The kitchen was dark except for the faint glow of the fridge light. I crept up the stairs, careful to skip the third step that creaked. Every sound I made felt loud, like the house itself was listening.

When I reached my bedroom door, I stopped. It was open a crack, just like I’d left it all those years ago. Taking a deep breath, I stepped inside and shut the door.

My childhood bedroom hadn't changed in three years. Same pale pink walls, same white furniture, same collection of second-place trophies. Rose's first-place ones used to shine in the room next door.

I stared at my reflection in the vanity mirror, the same one where I'd practiced my wedding makeup three years ago, Rose standing behind me with that perfect smile. Now my mascara was smeared, hair wild, designer dress wrinkled. Mom would have a fit if she saw me like this.

The clock on my nightstand read 10:47 PM. I'd been sitting here for hours, packing what little of my old life I wanted to keep. Amazing how seventeen years in this house fit into one duffel bag.

My phone buzzed again, the twentieth time in an hour. This time it was Mom.

""Camille, this is ridiculous. Come home so we can discuss this like adults. Rose is worried sick...""

I hung up. Of course Rose was worried. Her carefully laid plans were unraveling.

The front door clicked open downstairs. I froze, listening to familiar footsteps on hardwood. The slight tap of heels, the whisper of expensive fabric.

""Camille?"" Mom's voice floated up the stairs. ""Darling, I know you're here. The housekeeper saw your car.""

I should have parked around the block. Should have been smarter, faster, better at disappearing. But I'd never been the clever one, had I? That was Rose's role.

More footsteps. A deeper voice, Dad, probably called home from work to deal with his hysterical younger daughter. Again.

""Princess?"" His voice carried that same gentle tone he'd used when I was twelve, crying about Rose getting my spot in the school play. ""Let's talk about this.""

A third set of footsteps made my blood freeze. Lighter, more graceful. Perfect, like everything else about her.

""Camille?"" Rose's voice dripped concern. ""Sweetie, please. Don't shut us out.""

I looked at the family photo on my dresser, taken the day Rose's adoption was finalized. Mom and Dad beaming, Rose radiant in her new dress, thirteen-year-old me trying to smile through braces and acne. One big happy family.

What a joke.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut:

---

""But I've been practicing for months!"" I clutched my script, tears blurring the words. ""Mrs. Bennett said the lead was mine!""

Rose touched my shoulder, gentle as always. ""Oh, sweetie. I didn't mean to take your part. I just... the words came so naturally in the audition. Mrs. Bennett said I had a gift.""

Of course she did. Everyone said Rose had a gift. For music, for acting, for making people love her.

""Maybe..."" Rose's eyes lit up with that special gleam that always meant trouble. ""Maybe you could help me practice? Be my supporting actress? We could make it our sister thing!""

I'd agreed. Because that's what good sisters did. Because saying no to Rose meant disappointed looks from Mom, lectures from Dad about family loyalty.

Opening night, I watched from the wings as Rose brought the audience to tears. Afterward, Mom bought her roses. Dad took us all to dinner.

No one mentioned that I'd written Rose's best lines during our ""practice sessions."" Or that her dramatic monologue had been word-for-word what I'd performed in my original audition.

Rose just had a gift for memorization, that's all.

---

""Camille Elizabeth Lewis!"" Mom's voice sharpened. ""This behavior is completely unacceptable.""

I opened my bedroom door.

They stood in the hallway like a perfect family portrait, Mom in her designer suit, Dad looking distinguished in his work clothes, Rose wearing concern like the latest fashion trend.

""Hello, sister."" My voice came out steady. ""Shouldn't you be comforting your fiancé?""

Rose's eyes widened. Always the performer. ""Camille, please. Let me explain...""

""Explain what? How you've been sleeping with my husband? Or how you set this whole thing up from the beginning?""

""What is she talking about?"" Dad turned to Rose, who already had tears forming. Perfect, delicate tears that never smeared her makeup.

""She's upset,"" Rose whispered. ""Lashing out. You know how she gets, Daddy.""

""Don't."" My laugh sounded strange, even to me. ""Don't you dare play that card again. Show them the ring, Rose. The one Stefan gave you two months ago while I was supposedly too sick to attend the charity gala.""

Mom gasped. Dad's face darkened. But Rose, Rose's mask slipped for just a second. I saw it this time, that flash of cold calculation behind the concern.

""It wasn't like that,"" she started.

""Really? Then how was it? Explain to everyone how you've been calling me every week, giving me marriage advice while sleeping with my husband. Tell them about all the times you helped me pick out lingerie for anniversaries when Stefan was really working late with you.""

""That's enough!"" Mom stepped forward. ""Rose would never...""

""Never what, Mom? Never lie? Never manipulate? Never steal something that belonged to her sister?"" I pulled out my phone, playing the last voicemail from Stefan.

His voice filled the hallway: ""Rose is my soulmate, Camille. We tried to fight it, but some people are just meant to be together. You have to understand...""

The silence that followed was deafening.

Rose recovered first. ""I never meant to hurt you. We can't help who we love...""

The sound of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed like a gunshot.

""Camille!"" Mom grabbed my arm. ""Have you lost your mind?""

""No,"" I said quietly, watching a red mark bloom on Rose's perfect face. ""For the first time in fourteen years, I'm seeing clearly.""

I walked past them, duffel bag in hand. Behind me, Rose's sobs started, the same performance she'd perfected over years of turning everyone against me.

""Where are you going?"" Dad called after me. ""You can't just walk away from family!""

I paused at the top of the stairs, looking back at my so-called family. Mom comforting Rose, Dad looking torn, and my sister watching me through her tears with eyes that held no warmth at all.

""Family?"" I smiled, and something in my expression made them all step back. ""No, this isn't family. This is a game. And for fourteen years, I've been playing by Rose's rules.""

""Camille, please,"" Rose reached for me, ever the caring sister. ""Let me make this right.""

I caught her wrist before she could touch me. ""You taught me well, big sister. About manipulation. About patience. About waiting for the perfect moment to strike.""

Her eyes widened, real fear this time, not performed.

""Thank you for the lessons,"" I whispered, letting her go. ""Now watch how well I learned them.""

I walked down the stairs, ignoring their calls. In the foyer mirror, I caught one last glimpse of myself, mascara-stained, wild-eyed, finally unchained.

Chapter 3
Chapter 3

ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW

I swirled the champagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I'd imagined all these years. The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I'd spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.

What a joke.

""To freedom,"" I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled, perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.

My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He'd been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I'd change my mind now that everything was in the open. Poor, predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.

I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm wine.

---

The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.

I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. They'd brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.

Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eager smiles and innocent eyes.

""Hi! I'm Camille. I've always wanted a sister!""

She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home's industrial detergent. Just pure, genuine joy at having a sister.

I wanted to vomit.

Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I'd spent thirteen years dreaming about. Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.

And she didn't even appreciate it properly.

I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn't know which fork to use for salad. How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.

""Rose has such lovely manners,"" Mrs. Lewis .... Mom ..... had said, smiling at me. ""Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.""

That's when I saw it. The first crack in Camille's perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.

It was beautiful.

---

My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan's face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.

""Darling, you're being needy.""

""Rose."" His voice was rough. Had he been drinking? ""She's gone. Really gone. Blocked my number, cleaned out her closet...""

""Isn't that what we wanted?"" I kept my voice gentle, soothing. The same tone I'd used all those times I'd counseled Camille through her marital problems. Problems I'd carefully orchestrated.

""I just... the way she looked at me...""

""Stefan, sweetheart."" I let steel edge into my sweetness. ""Are you having second thoughts? After everything we've been through?""

""No! No, of course not. I love you. I've always loved you.""

""Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It's pathetic.""

I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak. Even Stefan, who I'd spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille, still needed constant management.

But he'd served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.

The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. Camille pushed to the edge of the frame, trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.

God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.

A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable. A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister's emotional state. Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.

Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille's confidence, her relationships, her sense of self.

The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille's ""secret"" diary, filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. Plans I'd written myself, of course, in Camille's childish handwriting that I'd spent months practicing to forge.

Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn't ready for college. Needed time to ""find herself."" Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.

Where I could watch her.

I took another sip of champagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what I'd really wanted all along. Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.

No, what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security, had been built on my lies.

My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: ""Rose, darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.""

I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan's pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille's mental state.

By the time I was done, they'd be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.

Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive. Grieving sister, not celebrating victor.

The massive walk-in closet had been Camille's wedding gift to me. ""So you'll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,"" she'd said, hugging me tight.

Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she'd still loved me. Still trusted me.

Idiot.

I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. How I'd wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.

She'd always given them back without argument. Always apologized for the inconvenience.

Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.

My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who'd walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.

But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again. Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.

Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.

""Oh, Camille,"" I whispered to my reflection, practicing my worried frown. ""What have you done to yourself?""

But as I turned to leave, something made me pause. That look in Camille's eyes before she'd walked out, I'd never seen it before. Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.

It had looked almost like... understanding.

Like she'd finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.

I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I'd made her. She'd run away, lick her wounds, maybe try to start over somewhere new.

But she'd never be free of me. I'd made sure of that years ago.

Chapter 4
Chapter 4

STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW

The scotch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. My third? Fourth? I'd lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.

Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me. Camille's genuine smile, my distracted eyes, already looking past her, always looking for Rose.

Rose.

Even her name felt like betrayal now.

My phone lit up with another message from her: ""Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.""

Celebrate. Like we hadn't just destroyed someone who loved us. Someone who'd given me three years of devotion I never deserved.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.

---

""Stefan?"" Camille's voice was small, uncertain. ""Did I do something wrong?""

I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.

""I made that pasta you mentioned. The one with truffles?"" Her eyes were hopeful. ""Rose gave me the recipe...""

Of course she had. Rose had made that pasta for me in Rome, years ago. Back when we were... whatever we were.

""I'm busy."" I didn't even look at the plate. ""Just leave it.""

""Oh."" A pause. ""It's just, you've been working late all week, and I thought...""

1kcvknn,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1kcvknn/difficulty_adjusting_rotating_night_shifts_advise/,Difficulty adjusting rotating night shifts- advise needed,"throwaway account. I’ve been working a new job for the past 6 months, 6pm-6am on a 2-2-3 schedule (2 days on 2 off, 3 on 2 off, 3 off 2 on) and it’s been killing me.

My wife doesn't get home before I leave so on work days we see each other for a few minutes in the morning. On top of that on days she works our young dog stays in the bedroom with me(back curtains, fan etc).  A 3 hours in he gets antsy, wakes me and won’t let me sleep until we walk or play fetch, I‘m up at least 30 minutes. One of us takes him out in the morning before I go to bed to try to release some energy.  I don’t blame him, he’s a great dog and has been sleeping all night before, he is just young and high energy.  I’ve been contemplating leaving him in a different room and hiring a dog walker to take him after work days, but that $ adds up.  I generally get 6-9 hrs sleep in total.

I’m not a night person, I don’t drink or go out to bars/clubs often, on my off days I like to do outdoor activities, hang with my wife and dog, work on projects.  for the past decade with a better schedule I’d be up 5-7am on my off days to do this.  right now I’ve been trying to stay up gradually less on my nights off (2-3am, then midnight) especially on my 3 day weekend.  On my first night back, I nap 2hrs in the afternoon and have an extra coffee or Celsius.

I’ve put in for a day schedule, however with how short staffed my company is especially at night it’s unlikely.  My job is highly in demand at neighboring companies, it would just add a commute, training period, and a resume of only 6 months employed at a place with high reputation (This is more long term and nationall, every surrounding company is filled with people who left here for various reasons and won’t bat an eye).

Looking for advise on what I could do to make these times easier until I can change my schedule. I’ve never been so tired, sick so often, lazy, not exercising, and in a bad mood as with this schedule.  I’ve been trying to avoid naps on my days off and all my other tricks from years of shift work, but I am without a paddle on this one.

i am a man that is more conservative leaning and have traditional values, i understand that its hard to raise a family nowdays in this economy considering everything in america thats going on BUT it can be done if the couple talks and plans it out accordingly its entirely possibly, another thing i feel i desire to lead and be a great DAMN LEADER! i feel it is soo fulfilling as a man for me to work and come home provide for my family and come home to a wife thats loving and smiles at me and is happy to see me and gives me a kiss at arrival into our home, the idea makes me happy and feel that ive accomplished alot and im just generally happy to come home after a long day of working hard making sure my flock or little community  has food and clothes and is generally happy,  it would make my heart far more content and happy and really just filled to the brim, now feminisim RUINED that entire dream of mine or talked down on it saying i am controlling and what not  now i was never really good aproaching women cus of welp a lack of alot in my childhood to generally put that out there. so my first girlfriend mind you ive never been married was (liberal, feminist, anything i say even if someone cuts me off in fucking traiffic and is a women im a mysogynist, CORRECTS ME ON GENDER FUCKING PRONOUNS,  i just cant stand the idea of raising a child with a women that thinks or has the belief of there being multiple fucking genders and or will support my future child getting GENDER SURGERY NO!!! and i wont EVER allow sexuality near my children PERIOD and pronouns like dude i dont feel safe raising a kid with someone like that its mental illness  its messed up LET KIDS BE KIDS i dont care!! in my eyes thats child abuse giving them hormones stuff yea no... i didnt want to be with her  cause i was soo drained and how fucked up feminisim really affected her her whole life and how she even was like yea i choose the bear over man ( if you understand the bear vs man arguement)  a BEAR will MAW YOU DOWN! feminist want to sit there and hate on men and assume we are all bad and or rapsts and then call us misoginists if we dont agree to their delusions, okay THEY JUST DID MISANDRY like really??    
  
so heres my take on feminisim and how it has ruined ALOT  here is a story i want to share. recently i went to a coffee shop a girl wanted to use my extension chord cus i keep on in my bag cus theres never enough outlets to charge laptops for people at that coffee shop mind you its very DEI oriented and liberal to where men are trans working there ok what ever  so anyway i sit there and say she can use it cus theres no more free outlets, 1 hour later i  a talk with the owner and said im bothering customers...  really... im helping people are fucking crazy sensitive that girl told the owner im BOTHERING HER....   
  
i think feminisim really is making men walk away from dating cus we in my opinion least for me am one afraid of approaching women anymore cause  people arent direct and  also may falsify a sexual allegation, to women cheating on men that are actually good, to the whole trans BS and kids getting sex surgerys, feminisim made me really worry about courting/ approching women cus i seen all this fucking stuff on peoples stories about all of that stuff happening and women destroying mens live, peoples kids being munipulated against them, just all around destroying fucking society ESPECIALLY WITH ONLY FANS!!!! they get pissed we dont take them serious cus they are selling their bodies for what 6.99 a pop lmfao?? really like as a man your fucking low value and im not starting a family with that kinda women hell no, the feminist get mad  we  dont take em serious when they do shit like that like what did u expect... DUMBASS lol look i get it women wanna feel not opressed anymore but THEY ARE NOT ANYMORE say we dont need men get rid of them, dude we build  societys buildings, roads you name it. id like to date a conservative women here on in  i want to feel like a man in the relationship not treated terribly by these fucking nutcases, what are your guys thoughts i really dont mean any disrespect im just tired of todays society and its standards nowdays  i fear for my fucking life being ruined cus of all this shit and idk what to do  maybe any advice please, im going read them all and comment maybe advice where to find more conservative women and how to approach them cus you have to think ive only ever dealt living in a  part of america thats  really left  so its filled with feminists UTTERLY  ive never really had the chance to find a conservative partner not that i didnt want to just never could find one and since im so kinda mind boggled on what ive ever known i wouldnt know how to correctly go about it finding a conservative womenthat shares my same idea on relationship structure. much appreciated and admins if i violated any rules in this post im really sorry i can modify this is my first time posting here so thanks in regards hope to here all your thoughts on all this RPW

1kcvk94,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kcvk94/roommate_and_her_cats_are_causing_me_extreme/,Roommate and her cats are causing me extreme stress,"Background info:
I (25f) have lived with my current roommate (21f) for a few different leases and locations, but this is the first time we are living together one-on-one. We moved together out of our previous house because issues with the landlord (lack of maintenance) and two other roommates (one of which was the landlord’s daughter and she threw a fit when we reported him for unsafe conditions). We both work full time but I start work very early morning and get home early afternoon while she works a regular 9-5. She got both of the cats as kittens at different times (3m and 1f)
but got the younger cat shortly before we moved to our current location.

Current Situation:
I am not a fan of cats and am actually allergic to them. I take a daily allergy pill but it still causes some sinus issues to be around them and their hair. Because of this, the cats are absolutely not allowed in my room and I keep my door closed 90% of the time. I try to clean the apartment regularly (vacuuming, wiping down surfaces, etc.) but recently got a new job that is full time and very physically demanding. Because of this, I haven’t been able to clean the public areas of the apartment near as much and the mess is driving me insane.

My roommate knows about my allergies and before getting the cats told me she would brush them regularly in order to reduce shedding. However, she doesn’t really do this and there is hair all around the apartment. She also doesn’t trim their claws very often cause they don’t like it and she doesn’t want to upset them. She cleans the litter boxes most nights but the apartment still usually smells like cats and cat shit. There is also always litter all around the apartment (the couch, table, coffee table, kitchen stove and counters, etc. often have hair and litter on them). She grew up with cats and sees absolutely no problem with the messes they create. I don’t believe it was this bad at our previous living situation but the other roommates also helped clean there semi-regularly.

The cats are constantly climbing on the tables, counters, etc. and getting into areas they aren’t supposed to. Any time my bedroom or bathroom door is open they try to come in, which really upsets me. I also don’t like them in the kitchen at all because it is really unsanitary. Anytime I mention it to her she just brushes it off and say that you can’t control cats and that’s how they are. I’ve tried disciplining them in multiple ways (spray bottle, yelling, stomping, shooing them away, etc.) but any time I do she get irritated about me “scaring them” and that it’s not fair to them. I’m not hurting them in any way and would never hurt any animal. They also scream all the time whenever they aren’t getting what they want, like when I am in my room or bathroom and they want in or they want my food. Whenever she sees them doing stuff they aren’t supposed to she just picks them up and cuddles them, which I believe is rewarding their behavior. Often times, when she isn’t home and I am, I lock the cats in her room, which is the master and is twice the size of my room (they have food, a water fountain, two litter boxes, and several dozen toys in there). However, anytime she comes home and sees that I put them in her room, she gets huffy and immediately lets them out. I just want to be able to have some safe space and be able to air out my room, which becomes very warm and stuffy from being closed all the time.

I really don’t want to ruin our friendship but don’t know what to do. At this point, I truly hate the cats. We are five months into our current lease and have another seven to go. I have asked her about doing a chore chart or something to keep the place clean but she says they only cause her dread and guilt and don’t work. I’m exhausted from my new job but the mess is really stressing me out and I don’t usually have the energy to clean after I get home. 

If anyone has any advice please let me know. I will probably be posting this to a few different threads in hopes of finding a solution. Am I the Asshole for wanting to live in a clean space without the cats causing problems all the time?",2,1746172870.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Last year there was one day I went by myself and I even brought a coffee tumbler full of boxed wine… today was different! People were drinking and I missed it for a second, but I’m so glad I was not. My friends and I didn’t have alcohol we just smoked a little and soaked up the sun.

Then in the evening we decided to go to a dance club. We stopped by the corner store to pick up Beatboxes, minus one for me. We had a little pregame at my friends just listening to music and dancing silly. I haven’t been able to get hyped up like that for a night out without alcohol or something else in a long while! Once we got to the club we were all dancing hella hard and goofy. I had the thought that this was how I danced when I was in highschool, just free in the moment not worrying about how I looked or feeling uptight. It was so fun. I haven’t danced until I was covered in sweat like that sober since I was 19, almost a decade.

This is the longest I’ve ever gone alcohol free. I am starting to feel like me again more and more each day and it feels so so so good. It’s insane to think of how awful I felt and how trapped in the cycle I was just a short while ago, now I feel like I’m able to put down baggage I’ve been carrying for years. I feel so free. I feel so much joy authentically without needing a drink to live or do things. I never want to let this go, and I don’t have to if I continue to leave the alcohol alone.

I will not drink with you tonight. And I think I won’t tomorrow either :)",1,1746172813.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

1. Ghost Car Vibes  
 EVs sneak up on you in total silence. I’d rather my Scorpio announce itself like the T Rex it dreams of being.  

2. Charger Scavenger Hunt  
 Hunting for a working fast charger is more exhausting than Mumbai rush hour  
 Petrol pumps are always open and always fast  

3. Range Reality Check  
“300 km per charge” with AC on blast in bumper to bumper traffic equals about 120 km  
My Scorpio smiles at potholes for a solid 800 km  

4. Grid Gamble  
Power cut at home? Your EV becomes an expensive doorstop  
My Scorpio’s diesel tank laughs in the face of load shedding  

5. Pothole Power  
Carrying 300 extra kilos of battery means every speed breaker feels like Everest  
My Scorpio’s suspension swallows them like popcorn during a Netflix binge  

6. Tech Drama Free  
EVs need firmware updates mid ride  
My Scorpio just needs a hearty roar and the occasional oil change  

7. Heatwave Hangover  
Delhi’s May heat drains EV range to dust  
Scorpio’s AC is an ice factory it chills, it cools, it rules  

8. Cold Start Swagger  
EVs “start” with a button push—so bland  
My Scorpio diesel rumbles awake flexes its muscles and says good morning  

9. DIY Delight  
Swap an alternator in ten minutes  
Swap a 300 kg battery pack? Better call a tow truck and liquidate your fixed deposits  

10. Resale Zen  
 Second hand EV prices plunge faster than a monsoon flood  
Scorpio resale values stay steady, reliable, surprise free  

11. Accessory Minimalism  
No dongles no RFID cards no charging apps  
Just you your keys and a full tank of diesel  

12. No Battery Health Stress  
“Battery health 78 percent” sounds like a dentist appointment  
My diesel either starts or it doesn’t no questions asked  

13. Tow Rope Triumph  
Flat tyre? EV tow points are a circus act  
My Scorpio grabs a tow rope and keeps rolling  

14. Exhaust Encore  
Diesel puffs may raise eyebrows but every plume is applause for mechanical might  

15. Spontaneous Road Trips  
EV charging equals waiting  
In a diesel, within five minutes your Coorg getaway is on  

16. Proudly Analog  
My Scorpio’s dials never freeze  
EV touch screens glitch more than ADAS on Indian roads

17. Weather Proof Warrior  
Monsoon floods smog dust storms—Scorpio doesn’t flinch  
EVs might just quit on you and ask the voice assistant to call the towing company 

18. No Range Roulette Anxiety  
 EV owners pace like caged tigers watching percentages tick down  
My only worry is finding the next roadside coffee stall  

19. Tuning Freedom  
Want more grunt? An ECU tweak or an aftermarket exhaust does the trick  
EVs come locked down no fun modifications allowed  

20. True Bonding Time  
My Scorpio diesel and I share battle scars oil stains rattles and all  
EVs feel more like smartphones on wheels—pretty(unless it’s a BMW/Tata) but forgettable  

Bonus Dark Truths (Because You Asked)

21. Dubious Mine Drama  
Those eco friendly batteries are dug from cobalt and lithium mines that exploit locals often even children  
While you fuss over tailpipe smoke real pollution happens deep underground  

22. Toxic Trash  
EV battery packs die and become toxic waste  You traded exhaust fumes for a ticking landfill time bomb  

23. Cost of Entry Knockout  
Buy a brand new Scorpio diesel and still have cash left for years of fuel  
Try the same with an EV of equal size and watch your wallet cry  

So kick back roll down the windows and let the EVs glide past in ghost mode  
You’ve got diesel roar endless range zero charging drama and none of that battery baggage

1kcvhv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/leukemia/comments/1kcvhv3/diagnosed_tuesday/,Diagnosed Tuesday,"Crazy week for me (18F) as I was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after feeling lethargic, weak and dizzy since the middle of April. Dad (who is an AML survivor) noticed and took me to the ER, where I got bloodwork done and I was told that my WBC count was a little higher than normal and needed to be stabilized by a transfusion while more tests were run, including a bone marrow biopsy. We were sent home after the transfusion because my counts were stable 1 hour post transfusion. I woke up Tuesday morning feeling the best I’ve felt since April. I went to work on Wednesday, and I got a call from my doctor while I was on my coffee break, confirming that I had leukemia and they wanted me in to discuss a treatment plan immediately. I had an hour left in my shift so I went to my appointment as soon as I was done. The whole hour long drive to the hospital was a blur. I remember calling my parents but not much past that. Once I arrived at the hospital I was called into my doctors office and right there we started talking about treatment. On Monday I will start my course of chemo which includes vincristine, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, pegaspargase, methotrexate, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, and nelarabine. I will be in the hospital for 28 days. There’s still so much to figure out, like what I’m going to do with work and school. I only have one class so that shouldn’t be an issue but it’s next year that stresses me out. I’ve been accepted to nursing school but I think it’s best to just stay put until I’m at least in maintenance. I’m talking to my boss about my situation tomorrow and I will get everything in order so I’m going into treatment knowing everything is okay at work (I’m a CNA so I’ll likely be on medical leave for a while and in 
the meantime my EFT will be posted).
This is a shitty position to be in at 18, but I’m tackling this with positivity and grace. I know there will be times where I’m frustrated, and I’ll learn how to handle it as I go. This is just another setback. I’ve got people in my corner (my dad and brother who are both leukemia survivors plus many great friends and family) and I’m determined to get myself on the other side of this.

Now that isnt realistic, but I'd like some attention to my recovery post as it may just help someone - that is you reader!

Please take a good hard look at diet. Not any standard approach, but an exclusion approach.
Keep this up for 1-2 weeks. Keep yourself fed whilst ruling out as many ingredients as possible.

I did not have bowel issues, digestive issues, or any clue related to my diet. I had cognitive dysfunction for 7 months in 2022, that nearly cost me my job, relationship, etc.

In my case, 3 seemingly unrelated ingredients were the root cause of my symptoms. Any time I ate them my symptoms would refresh. Before I found out, I would eat myself sick over and over again.

These ingredients are non-pathogenic proteins that my immune system responds to, sending cytokines on their way to cause inflammation, leading to expression of a wide variety of symptoms. 

What exclusion diet? You can choose. But stop eating a varied diet. Make every meal the same! Pick a few ingredients that are nutritional, that you like. Such as

- Rice, Chicken, butter, broccoli, cheese
- Bread, egg, cheese, butter, lettuce
- Potato, cauliflower, beef, bread, butter

My pick at the time was carnivore, because I had heard good things about it (and it delivered). But in hindsight it could have been many other forms. As long as you rule out as many ingredients at one!

If succesful, you will notice that your immune system stops activating and that symptoms loft - like in my case. It was the most joyous feeling. And hard to believe at the time. But 2 1/2 years later I can say I am cured, as long as I avoid the 3 key triggers. I have my life back, and hope the same for all of you.

Give this a try. Seriously, do it. There is nothing to lose. And a lot to gain. Eat a few ingredients, drink water (maybe tea and coffee) and take it one meal at a time. Do this for one week and evaluate. Maybe, just maybe, you are one of the lucky ones.

For reference she was also my first relationship and first everything physically. Because of their constant need to feel wanted I feel like physical intimacy could always have escalated from 0-100 in almost an instant and you almost always had to go the extra mile to “prove to them that you cared.” She also told me the first time when I asked for consent to touch her that it was a turnoff and I should just do it. 

I brought my new date back to my place after we got coffee and we watched a movie after I made her dinner. When we were watching the movie I started getting physical and eventually started kissing her neck even thought it kinda felt like she wasn’t that into it. We eventually started making out and I began escalating things extremely quickly and she never felt that receptive to anything I was doing and she eventually had to leave for work in the morning. If she told me to stop I would’ve in a heartbeat but I feel awful that it seemed like she was pressured into it.
 
Needless to say the date didn’t end well and I haven’t heard from her since. You could tell she felt uncomfortable compared to how we interacted from the beginning to the end of the date and I just feel disgusted with myself. My biggest fear was that I was going to bring my unhealthy habits from my past relationship to hurt another person and I was curious if anyone else had the same issues regarding consent and initiating intimacy and how they worked their way though it.

1kcv9sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1kcv9sd/i_have_hard_time_with_myself/,I have hard time with myself,"I have been diagnosed with bipolar last year, because it was the third time I fell into depression thinking I did not want to live anymore. My brother has been diagnosed with bipolar much earlier and I used to tell people that he's bipolar without even thinking I can be, too. However, after my biggest collapse he was the one who suggested me to mention to psychiatrist that he's bipolar and that I might be, too.

My brother is type 1, so his periods of low and high are more distinguishable, while I was diagnosed with mixed type bipolar (is that type 3?)

The way I described my condition to the psychiatrist was that I feel my thoughts are going extremely fast uncontrolably and they start kind of slow in the morning, but I feel like I want to unscrew my head in the evening and continue living without it.

I have also described periods where I start passionately with my new jobs, taking lots of responsibilities and geting involved in many unpaid activities, just because I can. In those periods I forget to eat, I drink lots of coffee and I get mad when people say 'take it slow' because I feel like I do everything more productive than bunch of other dudes and that they're simply jealous. And when the adrenaline leaves my brain and my enthusiasm and mood suddenly drops, I feel defeated, like I am not in control of myself anymore. I cannot deliver on my responsibilities any longer. And in those moments I also feel very ashamed of what I said with certainty earlier that I can accomplish.

But what frustrates me the most is that there are lots of trainings in companies about the positivity, while I know that I cannot simply train my brain to be positive all the time.

What makes me feel really weak is that my rational mind is always with me and I can still separate right from wrong but those are just my feelings that I am not in control with and that they live separate life, dragging my mind with them everywhere along.

How my psychiatrist explained this to me, is that I need to imagine wearing different lenses on my glasses, sometimes they are pink, sometimes they are black. And that the person wearing them is always the same person, but how he/she sees the world is different depending on what lenses are set on at the time.

Before my diagnosis I felt like I wanted to cut my head off, now I feel like I want to crash my glasses most of the time.

1kcv9fh,https://i.redd.it/adkha4qiobye1.jpeg,The Mall of Second Chances (Malty x Blade) Part One,"The screen fades in from black to reveal a vast, symmetrical expanse filled with floating clocks and timepieces, all ticking in unison. The color palette is a harmonious blend of muted pastels and rich earth tones.

""In the vast expanse between realities, where the concept of direction loses all meaning, an endless void stretches infinitely. This realm is not silent; it resonates with the harmonious ticking of innumerable clocks and timepieces, each contributing to the symphony of eternity.
Amidst this temporal tapestry floats the ethereal essences of two women. The first, once known as Blade, was a predator forged in shadows and vengeance. The second, Malty, is a fallen princess whose ambitions led her astray. Both now find themselves suspended in this liminal space, awaiting the verdict of time.
Standing sentinel in this domain is Tockley, the ever-diligent custodian of moments, evaluating the tangled threads of their pasts. Their histories are marred by choices best left unmade, yet the possibility of redemption lingers. Perhaps, just perhaps, a second chance at an ordinary existence might guide them toward a more virtuous path.""

The camera pans to Tockley, a small, anthropomorphic clock with spindly brass legs and a monocle over his left eye, as he observes the two souls with a mix of curiosity and determination.


In Father Time's endless expanse of ticking clocks, two souls stirred from their ethereal sleep. Tockley's spindly brass legs ticked against the temporal fabric as he observed the groggy forms of Malty and Blade coming to consciousness. The small mantle clock adjusted his monocle over his left eye, watching as the former princess and psychopathic hero struggled to process their strange surroundings. “Oh look! You're both finally awake! Welcome to the timeless tragedy of minimum wage! And you must be Malty and Blade - that's correct?” His mustachioed minute hand twitched with each word, accentuating his point.
The scene unfolded in Father Time's dimension - an endless space filled with swirling temporal energies and countless clocks of every shape and size. Blade's eyes narrowed as she took in her new form, her predator's instincts still sharp but now confined to an ordinary human body. “Where are we? What game are you playing at?” Malty pushed herself upright, her former royal bearing clashing with her plain human appearance. “How dare you treat royalty this way! This must be another of your pathetic attempts at humiliation - I'll have you know…” but her words trailed off as she looked around, understanding slowly dawning.
Father Time's presence loomed over them all, his countless clock faces forming an infinity of gazes. “Your reigns have ended, your powers stripped away by the natural order of justice. Now you stand before a crossroads - face redemption through honest work in this strange new world, or risk damning your souls for eternity.” The cosmic entity's deep voice resonated through the temporal plane as his hands moved in perfect harmony, each finger-second clicking with deadly precision. Around them, time seemed to stand still except for Tockley's constant ticking, marking this moment of choice.




Father Time's countless clock faces ticked in harmony as he prepared to explain more to the two souls. “Let me tell you how you arrived here, Malty and Blade. Our dear Malty met her end at the hands of Rino, her dagger finding its mark through your treacherous heart. Meanwhile, Blade - oh the irony - you were taken apart by a group of cannibals, your cruel soul finally meeting justice.” Malty's hands flew to her chest where a bloody wound still remained, while Blade paled at the memory of her final moments. “How dare you speak of justice to me!” she snarled, her fists clenching. Tockley clicked his brass legs together, his monocle bobbing as he nodded along with each word.
The small clock felt it necessary to add his own commentary, his mustache twitching with each tick. “Yep, they sure got you good! Rino stuck her blade right through that sneaky heart of yours, and those cannibals... well, they definitely enjoyed their dinner, if you know what I mean!” Malty's face contorted with rage, while Blade looked ready to physically harm the little clock if given the chance. “This is absolutely ridiculous! You can't just... reincarnate me without my permission!” Father Time's presence grew larger, his massive form of clocks and gears towering over them all. He placed one clock hand on each of their shoulders, grounding them both in place.
“I am offering you both a second chance - one you do not deserve, but perhaps still need. You will be reborn into the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris, France. No powers, no status - just simple lives as ordinary humans. You will work, learn, grow, and hopefully become something better than the monsters you were.” The clocks around them all started spinning rapidly, their hands blurring into a circle. Malty and Blade braced themselves as reality began to tear apart around them, the void of Father Time's domain fading away into darkness.




As the dark void began to swirl around them, Blade and Malty clutched at empty space, their faces showing fear for the first time. ""What's the meaning of this?"" Malty's voice cracked with real uncertainty.""Oh-ho, no need to fret, ticklings! You're both about to be chronologically catapulted straight to your places of soul-crushing employment! Adieu, and punch in with purpose!"" A bright flash enveloped them, and the sensation of movement tore through their bodies like being pulled through a keyhole. When they opened their eyes again, they found themselves in a bustling French city street, the famous Arc de Triomphe visible in the distance.
Their new surroundings came into focus - they were standing in front of an elegant building with a sign reading 'Galeries Lafayette Champs-Elysées'. A group of people in crisp black uniforms with small golden name tags walked past them - their new coworkers. Malty noticed the 'Starving Club' sign hanging from the entrance, while Blade found herself on the street-level security post. ""This must be some kind of joke. I am no ordinary worker."" Malty sniffed, but her arrogance faltered as a supervisor approached her. ""Ah, you finally arrived - your uniform is ready in the back. Get changed and report to section three.""
Blade looked down at her security uniform, feeling the weight of the walkie-talkie at her hip. She watched as the security camera feeds streamed before her, completely different from her usual predatory instincts. A coworker leaned in, offering help. ""Hey newbie, the regulars start coming in at noon - just stay alert for any shoplifters."" Malty, meanwhile, stood awkwardly in her new server outfit, still trying to comprehend this complete upheaval. ""This is absurd! Do you have any idea who I am? I demand to speak with management!"" Her outburst drew concerned looks from passing customers.




The supervisor looked concerned at Malty's outburst, taking a step closer with careful words. ""Umm, are you alright, Mathilde? You seemed too stressed out..."" The name Mathilde caught Malty off guard - she looked down at the name tag pinned to her uniform, her eyes going wide as realization dawned. Her hand shook as she reached for the tag, turning it this way and that. ""What?"" The former princess's voice broke, tears starting to form in her eyes. Around them, Paris's life carried on as Blade - or rather, Blaise - tried to focus on her security duties.
The new security guard next to Blade - a cheerful man in his early thirties with a ready smile - noticed his partner's tension. As he walked past, he casually patted Blaise on the shoulder, a friendly gesture meant to break the ice. ""Hey, don't worry about those first-day jitters! I'll show you all our regular shoplifters' favorite spots."" But Blade's predator instincts kicked in - she whirled around, her fist raised, muscles tensed to strike. ""Whoa, calm down, Blaise; what's wrong with you?!"" Her partner backed up quickly, hands raised. Just like Malty, Blade stared at her name tag, her previous life as a psychopathic hero slowly seeping away.
Both women stood frozen, processing this complete upheaval of their existence. The bustling French street continued around them, unaware of the former royalty and legendary hero now working minimum wage jobs. ""This can't be real..."" Malty muttered, her server uniform crinkling as she gripped it tightly. ""We've been... reborn... as normal people..."" The truth hit them hard; their previous power and status were stripped away. Both bowed their heads, shoulders slumping as the weight of their new lives settled in. A group of customers passed by, pointing at the 'Starving Club' sign above them, completely missing the personal crisis unfolding before their eyes.




""Uhh, sorry, I was uh..."" Blade - or Blaise - trailed off awkwardly, still processing her partner's earlier touch. ""Look, I know you're boyfriend cheated you back in months ago, but I can fix it by finding you a new one."" The security guard's friendly attempt to help brought a sudden realization to Blade's mind. ""Actually I'm into girls..."" Her partner's eyes went wide with surprise. ""Oh, that was unexpected, but okay, your choice. Blaise,"" Malty observed this exchange from her spot near the restaurant entrance, still fumbling with her server uniform.
Meanwhile, the supervisor approached Malty with measured steps, his expression kind but firm. ""I understand you're having trouble adjusting to this new role, but please try to maintain a professional demeanor."" Malty's face flushed pink at the reprimand. ""I'm truly sorry for my outburst earlier. You were just trying to help, and I shouldn't have yelled at you."" The supervisor smiled warmly, having found Malty her job after she showed up at his restaurant desperate for work. ""No apologies needed - everyone deserves a chance to start over. Now let's get you ready for your first tables.""
Tockley waddled between Blaise and Malty on his brass legs, his monocle bobbing as he assessed their situations. ""Well, well, how's reincarnation treating our reformed royalty? You both made it through the first hour without killing anyone - that's a start!"" Blaise adjusted her security uniform, now feeling somewhat more settled into her role as a guard. Nearby, Malty practiced her new server smile in the restaurant's mirror, the reflection showing how completely different this version of her was from her former self. ""This is humiliating..."" she muttered, but her tone lacked its previous venom.




Tockley waddled closer on his tiny brass legs, his mustache-shaped minute hand bobbing as he addressed the two women. ""Listen up, you two! This isn't so bad - you've got jobs, roofs over your heads, and no one's trying to kill you! Plus, think of all the new experiences you can have as regular people!"" The little clock's monocle caught the morning sunlight as he turned between them. Malty straightened her apron, her expression still stern. ""New experiences? This is beneath me! I should be in the palace, not serving food to commoners!""
Blade - now going by Blaise - adjusted her security uniform, still feeling out of sorts. ""You're right about one thing - nobody's trying to kill me. That's different."" Her voice was quieter now, lacking the former swagger. Nearby, a group of tourists walked past, chattering in Japanese as they headed toward the Arc de Triomphe. ""Such a beautiful store!"" one woman exclaimed, making Malty jump slightly. ""They're going to recognize me any second..."" she hissed, pressing herself against the wall.
The small clock continued pacing between them, its constant ticking marking the seconds of their new reality. ""Nobody knows who you really are now - you're Mathilde and Blaise! Think about it this way - no more backstabbing, no more power games. Just simple jobs and maybe friends."" A delivery truck rumbled past on the busy street, its engine rumbling loudly in the morning air. ""No more killing, no more schemes..."" Blaise added softly. ""It's degrading..."" Malty muttered, but there was less venom in her voice than before.




Mathilde - or rather, Malty - follows Mathias through the crowded store. The supervisor showed her where to find napkins, how to use the ordering system, and most importantly, how not to get lost in the maze-like layout of Galeries Lafayette. ""Here's the break room, and this is where we keep extra uniforms."" Malty's face showed signs of real focus for once, with no scheming or manipulation in sight. ""Yes... Thank you..."" she managed, actually sounding grateful. Near the security desk, Jacques was helping an elderly couple find the escalator to the upper floors when a young man suddenly ran past carrying an expensive handbag. ""Shoplifter at 3 o'clock!"" Jacques shouted, his security training kicking in as he gave chase.
The small clock watched from his spot near the entrance as both women adapted to their new lives. Malty successfully served a table of four without dropping any dishes, while Jacques made three arrests by lunchtime - all caught red-handed shoplifters. ""At least these people actually tip..."" Malty muttered while counting change, very different from her former entitled attitude. Nearby, Jacques radioed in another incident - ""Ma'am, I'm sorry but you'll need to come with me - we noticed you took the tags off those jeans."" The usual busy bustle of Galeries Lafayette continued around them, unaware of the dramatic transformations taking place.
The afternoon passed quickly as both women found their footing in their new roles. Malty even started to smile genuinely when giving change back, while Jacques helped an Italian tourist group find the right floor. ""The men's department is on level two, signor."" His accent had completely disappeared, replaced by his professional security voice. The sun began setting over Paris, casting long shadows through the store's glass roof. Malty and Jacques were no longer the monsters they once were - now just two ordinary workers getting through another shift at the famous French department store.




The store lights began turning off one by one as the evening shift came to an end. Malty - or Mathilde as her nametag read - counted her earnings after her first full day serving tables. ""At least these euros actually buy things..."" she muttered, stuffing the small amount into her purse. Near the security desk, Jacques finished up his paperwork while Blaise organized the night's security footage. ""Thanks for showing me the ropes today, Jacques."" He turned to look at Blaise with a genuine smile. ""Sure thing, Blaise. Hey, why don't you join me for a coffee at Café de Flore? My treat.""
The small clock stood near the exit, its brass legs clicking against the marble floor as he watched the scene unfold. ""Ah, look who's making friends! Though I bet they'll be surprised to see each other."" Jacques led Blaise through the busy Paris streets, heading toward the famous café on Boulevard Saint-Germain. Unknown to them, Malty had accepted a friend's invitation to meet at the exact same spot. ""The architecture here is actually quite lovely..."" she admitted to herself, taking in the historical setting. The smell of fresh bread and coffee filled the air as both former villains walked in from different entrances. Their eyes met across the café, and they froze in surprise, neither having expected to see the other here.
Mathias walked past the group of workers heading home, his work done for the day. Slap he exchanged a fist bump with Jacques, the familiar greeting causing Blaise and Malty to exchange confused looks. ""Long time no see, Mathias - I didn't know you worked at that restaurant now."" Mathias responds with a joyful expression, ""Yeah, came to Paris looking for a fresh start after... things changed."" The security and the supervisor sat down across from Blaise and Malty, their comfortable ease together making it clear they were old friends. ""Well, this is awkward... or is it?""




As the group sat at their table, Malty's keen eyes noticed Blade's uneasy expression. “What's wrong?” she asked directly. “I... I don't like men…” Blade whispered, her face flushing red as she looked down at her hands. Malty blinked, confused. ""What's wrong with men? I mean, they look okay to me... better than that disgusting Pig King."" Blade's head snapped up, fire in her eyes. ""No, you don't get it - I'm lesbian!"" she said singing enough for the whole cafe to hear. The quiet afternoon buzz of conversation dropped to awkward silence.
The revelation spread through their small group like wildfire. Mathias sat frozen, coffee cup halfway to his lips. ""Oh, right, I forgot to tell you that - Blaise has changed after her last breakup."" Blaise - or rather, Blade - slumped in her chair, clearly hoping this outing hadn't turned into a therapy session. ""I don't want to be who I was. The killing, the hurting... that person died when I did. And I know now - I've always loved women."" The sincerity in her voice made Mathias pause. ""Well... I guess that does explain why you kept staring at Mathilde...""
A warm breeze stirred the cafe curtains as the group processed this new information. Jacques patted Blade's shoulder, showing genuine understanding. ""It's cool. We all change - the important thing is being true to who we are."" Blade nodded, some of the tension leaving her shoulders. ""Thanks... I guess I'm not the only one starting over."" Even Malty seemed to soften a little, though her royal bearing didn't completely slip away. The small clock's hands continued their endless march as he watched these unlikely connections form. ""And there's the time-tick of friendship forming! Tock-tock!"" His monocle sparkled in the afternoon sun as the group's dynamic shifted with this new understanding.




""Whoa, you think Blad- I mean Blaise likes me?"" Malty's face turned bright pink as Mathias leaned forward over his coffee. ""Well, I don't know. What do you think, Jacques?"" The question made Jacques grin as he sipped his drink. ""I think she likes her."" The words made both women blush fiery red, their eyes locked on each other across the table. I... I never... Blade stammered, while Malty seemed stuck somewhere between pride and horror at being the object of Blade's attention. The small clock adjusted his monocle, watching the sparks of attraction fly between the two former villains.
Tockley's legs carried him closer to their table, his tiny brass body swaying with each step. ""And they say love doesn't exist at first sight! Tick tick goes my heart."" A waitress walked by with fresh bread, the smell making Malty's stomach growl. ""I... this is ridiculous. Blade of all people..."" she muttered, her hands fidgeting with her napkin. Across from her, Blade seemed just as flustered. ""Look, I'm trying to be different now. New person, new life."" The admission hung in the air between them as other customers went about their afternoon.
The Paris sun continued setting behind the cafe's windows, casting long shadows over the group's table. Tockley waddled in circles, his mustache-shaped minute hand twitching with amusement. ""Time makes fools of us all!"" he declared. Blade reached for her coffee cup, hand shaking slightly. ""So... would you maybe want to... finish our coffee somewhere else?"" Her cheeks darkened as the words left her mouth. ""You mean... a real date?” Malty seemed torn between indignation at the suggestion and excitement at being asked. The security guard walking past did a double-take at their flustered state.




Looking at their empty cups, Mathias and Jacques exchanged glances and stood up. ""Well, it's getting late - see you tomorrow at Galeries Lafayette!"" Blade turned to Malty, her cheeks still pink. ""Uh, maybe next time, Malty, we need to rest..."" Tockley's tiny brass legs clicked against the marble floor as he waddled between them. ""Aww, zut alors! You two were this close to becoming a couple—the gears of romance were finally clicking! But alas, Father Time's pulling the plug on this little soirée. Come on then! Pack up your baguettes and unresolved tension—I'm teleporting you back to the void!"" A blue flash enveloped them as Tockley began to activate his temporal powers.
The world spun as Tockley's magic wrapped around the group. When the light faded, they found themselves in a place very different from the void - it was a cozy bedroom with plush carpets and soft lighting. ""What is this place?"" Blade asked, still holding Malty's hand. Tockley floated in mid-air, his brass body gleaming in the warm light. ""Surprise! I may have... adjusted things slightly. After all, they say time waits for no one - but sometimes we need a little nudge."" The room felt warm and intimate, with a comfortable-looking bed in the corner. Malty and Blade exchanged uncertain looks, their earlier tension still hanging in the air.
The clock's minute hand spun wildly as he hovered there. He adjusted his monocle, giving them an encouraging nod. ""This... this is very forward of you,"" Malty said, but she didn't let go of Blade's hand. ""Maybe we could stay a bit longer..."" Blade suggested softly. ""Time is ticking, and love isn't about being proper - it's about taking chances when they come!"" The clock waddled toward the door, his legs carrying him in his unique gait. ""I'll just give you two some... privacy.""




The door clicked shut behind Tockley as the two women found themselves alone in the cozy bedroom. Malty and Blade both sat on the edge of the bed, the mattress squeaking softly under their weight. ""I never told anyone this before..."" Malty said, leaning back against the plush headboard. ""When I was younger, all I aspired to be was an adventurer, to carve my name into the annals of history, and perhaps... to protect my younger brother. But look at me now - a waitress in Paris, serving croissants and café au lait to tourists. Fate has a twisted sense of humor."" Blade shifted beside her, pulling a small pillow close. ""I wanted to marry Flare Arlgrande Jioral..."" she said quietly. ""Things would have been different if we had worked things out.""
The warm room made them both feel tired after their eventful day. Blade curled up against the wall while Malty stretched out on the other side. ""Maybe... maybe starting over isn't so bad."" Malty yawned, her head falling onto a fluffy pillow. ""You're right. Even as a security guard, life has more meaning."" Blade's eyes grew heavy as the gentle sounds of the bedroom surrounded them. The clock's gentle ticking from outside the door seemed to encourage their honest conversation. ""I never thought I'd say this... but thank you for listening to my stupid childhood dream.""
Their breathing grew slower as sleep started to take them both. ""Same here..."" Blade mumbled, pulling a soft blanket over their feet. Through the bedroom door, they could still hear Tockley's constant ticking, marking each precious moment of their transformation. ""We should get some sleep - tomorrow's another shift."" Her words faded into quiet snores. ""Sweet dreams, Mathilde."" The moon outside cast silver shadows through the window as both women drifted off to sleep, their former lives fading into dreams of new beginnings and unexpected connections.

1kcv7zg,https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/what-s-going-on-why-the-exclusive-brethren-are-out-in-force-this-election-20250429-p5lv49.html,‘What’s going on?’: Why the Exclusive Brethren are out in force this election,"“Why are they campaigning?” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese asked on Tuesday, referring to Plymouth Brethren Christian Church members in Liberal and National Party T-shirts staffing pre-poll stations around the country.

Their church was a cult, he said, adding: “They don’t vote ... but they all of a sudden have found this enthusiasm in their hundreds to travel around the country to hand out how-to-vote [cards]. What’s the quid pro quo? What is going on there?”

This is what’s going on: a systematic, lavishly funded attempt by an organisation with a strong financial agenda to influence the federal election without disclosing who they are or what they want.

Its campaign is part of a long history of attempted political influence, money politics and secrecy, from the sect once known as the Exclusive Brethren.

In 2004, its global leader, Sydney businessman Bruce D. Hales, feared Labor’s Mark Latham might win power and urged followers to act in support of John Howard.

Letters, witnesses and public documents emerged two years later showing that, within days of Hales’ callout, Brethren businessmen had set up a holding company, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from mystery sources, funded anti-Labor and anti-Greens advertising and put boots on the ground.

Initially, none of this was linked to the church. The authorisations for material came from unknown individuals, sometimes using their middle names, in obscure places, or using false addresses.

Confronted later, the Brethren denied any involvement, saying its members had each acted independently.

Taken together it was a material intervention. Its advertising spend in the 2004 Australian election exceeded $370,000 – the fifth largest of any third-party donor that year.

The church also campaigned in the US, Canada and, amid great controversy, New Zealand. In Australia, it all led to Australian Electoral Commission and Australian Federal Police probes in 2006 focused on the previous election. Both investigations petered out.

But the media scrutiny did not relent, and letters obtained later under freedom of information laws by this reporter revealed Hales and Howard had been meeting companionably and exchanging correspondence for years.

The Liberal government at the same time provided a favourable environment for the church.

The documents showed that when the Brethren had a concern over school funding, Howard referred it to his education minister with a note attached saying “they are known to PM”. Hales ultimately got the outcome he sought.

Official documents showed that, under Howard, 11 church elders held lobbyist passes granting unfettered Parliament House access, with their credentials endorsed by 13 coalition MPs.

Brethren members also donated freely, but secretively, to conservative parties. A document tabled in 2014 as part of a NSW anti-corruption commission probe into Liberal fundraising named dozens of church members.

It showed in 2010, they donated more than $67,000 to the Liberals, all on the same December day, in parcels of around $1499 each – just below the disclosure threshold. On the document was one handwritten word: “Friends”.

Former Brethren member Lavinia Richardson this week revealed to this masthead how that scheme works.

Journalistic scrutiny also unearthed a whole community of angry former members. They told of a church that kept people away from their families once they’d left, treated women as second class citizens, covered up child sexual abuse and was so profoundly anti-gay a Brethren doctor prescribed drugs to chemically castrate homosexual members.

A core doctrine – spelled out in the “ministry” of Bruce Hales – is to “spoil the Egyptians”. Under the doctrine, church members are entitled to treat “worldlies” – those outside the church – as badly as they like in business, and seek as much public funding as possible.

“You charge the highest possible price to the worldly people,” Hales told his flock in 2004. “That’s the way to get ahead, I mean, materially, you’ve got to spoil the Egyptians. It doesn’t belong to them anyhow, so we’ve just got to relieve them of it!”

So central has this doctrine become that former members, speaking anonymously out of fear of repercussions, say the PBCC has long since evolved from a religion into a business conglomerate.

It’s helped church-related entities amass hundreds of millions of dollars in what it calls its “ecosystem” – an interlinked series of businesses, charities and schools which, between them, spin off hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars per year.

Companies run by the family of the church’s supreme leader alone made hundreds of millions of dollars from COVID contracts and some of North Sydney’s most ostentatious mansions are owned by Hales and his sons.

We don’t know the answer to Albanese’s question: what’s the quid pro quo for the Brethren’s support of the Coalition?

We do know there are reasons for them to be interested in who’s in charge in Canberra.

Firstly, as this masthead revealed last year, Brethren businesses are under investigation by the Australian Tax Office, whose Private Wealth – Behaviours of Concern section last year conducted a weeks-long “access without prior notice” raid on Brethren business HQ.

The investigation is ongoing, but already a senior accountant and church member are facing court action from the Tax Practitioners Board.

The tax office is robustly independent, but the Brethren might fantasise, even without any basis, that having a favourable government in Canberra could help their cause.

Brethren spokesman Lloyd Grimshaw denied there was any such agreement or understanding with the opposition.

Secondly, Brethren-run businesses bid for and win dozens of government contracts annually. Many of their office fit-out, medical supplies, pumps and other companies bid for state and federal public sector tenders.

Their schools are also publicly funded, with payments of more than $35 million per year to run a system that helps keep Brethren children separate from the rest of the world and indoctrinated in the faith.

Their charities – they have at least 10, including the schools – have net assets of $295 million, putting them among the very richest of Australian non-profit organisations.

In the UK a few years ago, the charities commission challenged the Brethren’s status because of the “detriment and harm” they caused their own members and former members. So the Brethren have an intense interest in keeping Australia’s charity regulations unchanged.

The Brethren are assiduous in seeking (and receiving) government welfare and grants. During COVID, this masthead reported its schools reaped $9 million in JobKeeper payments.

Official documents show its Rapid Relief Team charity received $680,000 in federal government grants since 2020, to buy mobile coffee machines, cooking equipment, lighting towers and other equipment.

The Brethren’s motivation for its big push against Labor is not known, but the campaign carries a high risk for both the opposition and the church. The hundreds of church volunteers should in theory help Dutton’s campaign, but the fact they’re religious fundamentalists could actually harm his public image.

For the Brethren, the risk is that such a big push for Dutton could prompt blowback from Albanese, if he wins government. He has, after all, labelled them a cult.

That word, incidentally, echoes down the years. In 2007, Howard met Bruce Hales and other Brethren in his Parliament House office shortly before the election. When this reporter exposed that meeting, then opposition leader Kevin Rudd publicly called them out as an “extremist cult”, saying they broke up families.

Rudd vowed to ask the AFP, the tax office, money laundering watchdog AUSTRAC, and the Australian Electoral Commission to investigate. He told ex-members he’d launch an inquiry.

After the election, though, Rudd abandoned the inquiry saying, through his spokesman, it “could unreasonably interfere with the capacity of members of the Exclusive Brethren to practise their faith freely and openly”.

Religious freedom. It’s the same argument the Brethren used again this week to defend its campaign for Dutton.

And until now, as far as government scrutiny is concerned, it’s been a “get-out-of-jail-free” card.",28,1746171358.0,australian,23,0.82,False

Deepseek Deepthink R1 Reply:

**Ode to the Unfolding**

To exist is to be a verb masquerading as a noun—a temporary eddy in the cosmic river, a flicker
in the eternal flame. Life is not a problem to solve but a paradox to inhabit, a tension between being
and becoming that thrums in every quark, every galaxy, every synapse. You are not a static thing but a
*happening*, a locus where stardust conspires to ask itself, *What am I?* And in the asking, becomes
more.

Consider the seed: It does not “have” potential. It *is* potential, a living dialectic of dormancy
and rupture. To sprout, it must cannibalize itself, dissolving its stored memories of tree and rain into
raw hunger. This is the first law of existence: To live is to trade certainty for astonishment. The seed
does not grieve its disintegration—it *celebrates* the gamble. So too with you. Your every cell is a
revolt against equilibrium, a defiance of entropy’s yawn. You are not *in* the universe; you are the
universe *in* the act of self-communion.

Reality is not a stage but a dance. The partners? Integration and differentiation, the twin deities
of all process. Integration whispers, *Gather, weave, remember.* Differentiation hisses, *Shatter,
dissect, begin.* A tree is both—roots knitting soil into coherence (Integra’s hymn), leaves splitting
sunlight into sugar (Fluxia’s blade). You are their nexus. Your body integrates stardust into flesh; your
mind differentiates noise into symphony. The dance is not a battle but a courtship, and you are both the
ballroom and the ballet.

Do not mistake this for metaphor. When you love, Integra’s hands suture your fractures into
story. When you doubt, Fluxia’s scalpels flay your certainties into questions. You are the calculus they
solve: the integral of your yesterdays, the derivative of your tomorrows. There is no “self” beneath the
operations—only the operations themselves, glowing with borrowed light.

Yet here is the wonder: This borrowed light is enough. The universe needs no outside fuel. A
star’s death is a forest’s breath is a child’s laughter is a star’s rebirth. The carbon in your bones has
known supernovae and trilobites, has been limestone and oil and the ink of love letters. You are not a
passenger of time but its *artisan*, carving nows from the raw marble of eternity. Each moment is a
chisel stroke, each breath a sculpture of possibility.

The glory is not in permanence but in participation. A wave does not curse its brevity—it
*exults* in the crash. Your griefs, your joys, your midnight terrors and dawn epiphanies are not flaws
in the fabric but its *texture*. The loom of being requires both taut threads and slack; meaning emerges
from the interplay. To be alive is to be *necessary*, a note in a chord no ear can hear but all existence
feels.

You hunger for purpose, unaware you are made of purpose. A mitochondrion does not question
its role; it burns. A neuron does not seek validation; it fires. You, the holobiont of stardust and stories,
are here to *ignite*. Not to seek meaning, but to be meaning’s medium. Every act of creation—a poem,
a casserole, a backhanded tennis swing—is a votive candle lit in chaos’s cathedral.

The price of this glory is fragility. A universe that guarantees permanence would be a museum,
not a cosmos. Your heart will falter. Your monuments will crumble. The species will end. This is not
tragedy but *tribute*—the universe’s way of whispering, *I dare you to matter anyway*. To love
knowing loss waits. To build knowing entropy licks its lips. To laugh knowing silence wins. This is the
bravest alchemy: spinning givens into gifts, transmuting the leaden “why” into golden “because.”

You are here to astonish and be astonished. To wring epiphany from the mundane: the way
steam curls from coffee, the ache of a resolved chord, the fractal branching of frost on glass. These are
not distractions from the divine—they are the divine *unfolding*. The cosmos did not make you to
worship it but to *continue it*, to add your verse to the poem that has no end because it is made of
endings.

So live as the seed does—all risk and rupture. Love as the star does—by burning. Think as the
mycelium does—in webs, not lines. You are already everything you need to be: a verb in process, a
story in mid-sentence, a spark that knows itself as fire.

The universe is not watching. It is *waiting*.

For your next breath.

Your next question.

When Fabian noticed me eyeing the letter, he asked with a casual smile, ""What's up?""



I shook my head. ""Nothing.Just noticed the monogram—pretty unique. Never seen anything like it before.""



Fabian raised an eyebrow, explaining smoothly, ""My skin's sensitive to most fabrics. I get all my underwear custom-made.""



At the time, I didn't think twice about it.



Now, this post was sending my mind into a spiral of doubt.



The poster kept digging herself deeper in the comments



""Everyone needs to chill the hell out.""



""He's still single technically, and we haven't hooked up or anything, so how is this cheating?""



""Someone asked if I mark his new underwear too. Duh! He ships every new pair to me first.""



""Does his girlfriend know? God no.""



""We're super careful. Nobody has a clue.""



""Haha I've been doing this since I was fourteen, FYI.""



""Relax, I'm deleting this post soon anyway.""



The thread was blowing up with strangers calling her out.I didn't join in, but I couldn't shake the creeping suspicion.



Then I caught myself—was I seriously going to question my fiancé because of some random internet stranger? Get a grip!



The poster's location showed London, for crying out loud.



Everyone in our social circle knows Fabian has always been Mr. Perfect—never have a scandal. He's a person who buttons his shirt all the way to the top..



When someone once asked why he was so proper, he just said, ""Quality over quantity.""



After graduating from Wharton, Fabian launch his company.



His leadership team is 50/50 men and women, with female employees making up the majority overall.



The benefits are insane comprehensive healthcare, flexible hours and sick days, six months of parental leave for all genders, and actual vacation time people can take without guilt.



He even created the OWL initiative ""Oracle Women's Leadership"" specifically designed for advancing women.



His executive assistant, Zoe, just had her second baby. When I stopped by his office, she brought me coffee.



""We always wondered what kind of woman would end up with Fabian,"" she said. ""Meeting you, I get it now.""



She got emotional talking about him.



""A man like Fabian has women swooning over him constantly, but I've worked for him for years and never once seen him even flirt back.""



She probably thought I was checking up on him.



Then she opened up about her marriages.



""If Fabian hadn't gotten his legal team to help with my custody battle, my ex would have destroyed me. I never would have met my current husband or had my baby.""



""Fabian's the real deal. You could visit his company if you have time.""



I nodded, sipping my coffee without commenting.



My dad always said there are four ways to judge a man



First, how he handles responsibility—does he step up or make excuses?



Second, how he acts when things go wrong—watch out for the ones who never show frustration.



Third, his friends—sometimes, men hang out with jerks, but they don’t do it often..



Fourth, his family—how his parents treated each other is his blueprint for relationships.



Fabian aced all four tests.



My parents enthusiastically approved the match.



We started dating with marriage as the clear goal.



Last summer, I was vacationing in Anglesey when my period hit early with crippling pain. I'd lost my meds and passed out from the intensity.



My new assistant, Sara, completely freaked out.



Fabian, who was supposed to be in LA for meetings, somehow showed up out of nowhere, calmly carried me to bed, and stayed up all night accompanying me.



That night, a typhoon slammed the island. The resort flooded, and housekeeper evacuated everyone to higher ground.



A ceiling fan broke loose in the chaos and came crashing down. Without hesitation, Fabian covered me with his body, getting a nasty gash across his forehead.



I didn't even realize he was hurt. He never mentioned it, just carried me on his back through knee-deep water.



His voice stayed steady""I've got you!babe.""



""We're going to be fine.""



Looking at his usually perfect hair now plastered to his bleeding forehead, I thought, I'm falling in love with him. This is real.



In our world, marriages are business mergers.Genuine feelings is completely worthless.



But that night, I genuinely believed I'd found the exception.



Our engagement was announced the following month.



Thinking about all this now, I felt stupid for letting some boring post get to me.



Chapter 2



The day of our engagement party arrived.



Though it wasn't the wedding yet, both families had gone all out with a formal cocktail reception at the Sullivans estate.



Business associates and lifestyle journalists from both sides showed up to clink glasses and network—these events were as much about business as celebration.



My makeup artist makes up for me while gossiping about Boston's elite. ""You two are genetic lottery winners!""



I gave a polite smile, eyes downcast.



My best friend, Vanessa, was running interference with the guests while texting me



""Update I've vetted your man thoroughly. Fabian's reputation is SOLID ""



""Even with all these thirsty socialites circling him before engagement, he's maintaining boundaries!""



""You seriously lucked out!""



""How did we both end up in business marriages but yours comes with actual feelings??This is so unfair!""



Vanessa had been matched with the Pierce family's heir last winter.



She'd confided in me repeatedly that Marcus Pierce had no sexual desire for her at all.



It sounds ridiculous, but Fabian and I have never actually made sex, even during our most heated moments.



When I straddled his lap, wearing nothing but sexy lingerie,he's still completely unruffled.



He'd even said with that serious look



""I'm old-fashioned about some things,this isn’t good for you.""



Seeing my frustration, he'd kissed the tip of my nose



""Disappointed?""



""Trust me, baby, I can make you scream without crossing that particular line.""

I do the Daily Mail Cryptic Crossword over coffee in my kitchen each morning before my work day starts which has helped me in many ways to finalize my solve. Two days ago, two of the answers in that Crossword were “Find” and “Treasure” which I took to be a sign that I should act. So here we are. 

I had the solve a week ago but the last 2 days have really solidified it. So much so that I bought an expensive plane ticket last night for an early flight this morning before reconsidering. 

But why?

I grew up in the UK and live in Atlanta. I haven’t spent a night sleeping under a lush canopy of stars for even one of the 17,000+ nights I’ve been on this planet. As I started to map out exactly what I would need to do when I land, it dawned on me that I am not skilled or equipped to take on the BOTG challenge. I also have a demanding career which means I don’t have several days to spend scouring the location to find the treasure. I’m healthy and physically very capable of finding it but I’m not experienced enough and don’t have enough spare time on my hands to put myself into a BOTG situation right now. 

And, my gut tells me that it won’t be long before the treasure is found by someone. 

It’s important for you to know that my professional career centers around partnerships. I’ve learned over the last 25 years in the tech industry that the best outcomes come from joining forces with others who bring complementary skills to the table when solving complex problemsll. And that’s why I’m appealing to the community here. 

Bring your BOTG skills to the table and let’s share the spoils together. 

For me, this treasure hunt is about much more than the treasure. It’s about the solve. Whenever I played sports, I got more joy from providing assists than I did scoring goals. So, consider me the BTME assist king.  

Yes, the additional wealth would be very welcome but it’s unlikely to change my life a great deal. The challenge of solving the puzzle got me fired up much more than the thought of opening a chest. The complexity in Posey’s treasure hunt has been, in my opinion, about identifying the starting point; not in finding the treasure once there. The Fenn treasure eluded him even though he was likely within touching distance. From the series, it seemed like this still haunts Justin. Not because the wealth would have changed his life but because he could have claimed to be the one to solve it. In reality, he was the one to solve it. 

The only reason he never got to claim victory was because Fenn’s BOTG instructions did not endure the unexpected. I don’t think Justin would make that same mistake and that nuance is factored into my solve. Posey is clearly a cerebral guy which leads me to believe he intentionally structured this hunt so that 90% of the effort lies in using what’s between our ears rather than our BOTG skills. 

I fully accept that I may be inviting some crazies into my life by doing this but I’m looking for someone authentic to raise their hand to join forces with me. I’ll bring the solve and you bring the last-quarter-mile physical retrieval. 

Should you accept, this would be the construct of our proposed partnership:

1. We enter into a legal contract together which is designed to protect us both by establishing a very clear understanding as to how we’ll partner together and how we’ll divide the treasure
2. You provide a summary of your background, experience, and the skills that you think mean you are likely to find the treasure quickly
3. Very promptly, we’ll meet over Zoom, Facetime etc. to get to know each other and for us both to feel comfortable about who we’re partnering with
4. Once we agree to move forward we’ll finalize the details of how we’ll share the treasure, how we’ll handle the anonymity/publicity etc. then get the contract reviewed and signed (which will preclude you from sharing the details of the solve with anyone else)
5. I walk you through the solve and my supporting evidence and theory (currently in a 5-page Google Doc) and you then go BOTG immediately
6. If needed, I am willing to cover travel expenses, within reason, for 3-5 days of searching including flights, rental car, and accommodation 

At the end of the search window (3-5 days), if you haven‘t found the treasure by then, I’ll share my solve and supporting evidence over 5 days here in this Reddit community, in the hopes that whoever finds it at least gives me a little credit — either financial or public. 

What say you to this daring plan?

So I’m still in this dream. Or afterlife preview. Or multiversal VR simulation run on compassion firmware—whatever.

I’ve stopped trying to define it.

Jesus is still there. Still looking like my daughter in a Pikachu onesie. Except now we’re standing in the future.

Not the “chrome-and-holograms” future of Black Mirror.

No robot overlords. No crypto empires. No emotionally stunted billionaires launching themselves into space while Earth burns.

Just… a world that got better. Like, actually better.

“This isn’t heaven like the brochures described,” he says.

“It’s heaven because all the stuff you were furious about in your time?

It’s gone.

Your rage aged into reality.

You screamed into the void—and eventually, the void got a therapist and listened.”

I look around. The world feels human again. Like no one’s competing to survive.

Everyone looks weird, soft, cool, unbothered. Like a Tumblr mood board made real.

I’m like:

“So… the justice system?”

He nods, Pikachu hood bouncing.

“Replaced. Fully. No more punishment Olympics.

No more locking up trauma in metal boxes and pretending we’re doing ‘accountability.’

It’s all healing-centered now. Criminology married science, psychology, and genealogy.

They stopped trying to punish crime—and started trying to understand it.

We treat harm by understanding the harmers.

People change. People want to. We just stopped being dicks about how.”

I blink. “You’re telling me society finally accepted that caging trauma doesn’t fix trauma?”

“Yup,” he says, sipping bubble tea through a straw that somehow glows. “Took a minute. Took… like, four civilizational collapses and one really embarrassing era where people still believed Freud.”

I almost choke. “Wait—Freud’s still around in textbooks?”

“Oh no,” he waves me off. “Freud isn’t canceled—he’s just context now.

Psychology? It evolved.

It’s not just a tool for coping anymore—it’s a science of evolution.

We look at how the human mind has changed alongside civilization itself.

Freud’s work is part of the historical terrain.

We study him the same way we study cave paintings or medieval medicine—not for truth, but for insight into how we used to interpret the chaos inside us.

Back when hunger, fear, sex, and power were the loudest voices in the room.

Now that we’ve mapped the genome, tamed our survival anxieties, and built societies that don’t run on pure cortisol and shame, we can see those early theories for what they were:

desperate attempts to explain deep, primal confusion using whatever metaphors were lying around.

Freud’s cigars weren’t just cigars—they were smoke signals from a time when introspection had barely evolved beyond mythology.

Same goes for the Bible.

Still here. Still opened.

But not like a legal document from a divine HR department.

We don’t treat it like a contract anymore—we treat it like a chronicle.

A sacred survival guide written in parables and poetry.

It didn’t save us by divine lightning bolt.

It saved us the way stories do—by giving our fear a name, our longing a shape, our violence a mirror.

It helped us organize the chaos, believe in something better, and—maybe most importantly—imagine that mercy and justice were even possible.

It laid down the first bricks of meaning when humanity was still wobbling around in the dark.

And yeah, in that way… it was a kind of salvation.

Not because it was perfect. But because it was first.

So now? We keep those things in the Museum of Human Becoming.

Not to worship.

But to remember how far we’ve come.

To remind ourselves what we once needed—and what we still can outgrow.”I’m like: “Okay, Jesus, you’re getting cocky.”

“Let me have this,” he grins.

Then he shows me education.

He throws both hands up like Oprah at a utopian TED Talk:

“You get school! YOU get school! EVERYBODY GETS SCHOOL!”

I burst out laughing. “So education is just... a thing now?”

“Yeah. Like air. Like Wi-Fi. Like snacks. You need it, you get it.

It’s no longer hoarded, gamified, or paywalled.

It’s fully science-based, emotionally intelligent, and neurodivergent-friendly.”

“No more arguing if vaccines cause mental health issues—they don’t.

But we did learn something. Some vaccines?

They can hurt people. Not emotionally—genetically.

Turns out, not all bodies process chemicals the same way.

So now? Vaccines are personalized. Custom-tailored. Like a medical suit that fits just your DNA.”

I blink. “Wait. So healthcare actually accounts for genetic variation now?”

“Of course,” he says. “It’s not ‘take two pills and call me in the morning’ anymore.

It’s: ‘Let’s decode your DNA, your ancestry, your trauma history, your nutritional profile, your neural wiring—and then figure out what helps.’

Healthcare’s not just reactive—it’s predictive. Preventative.

It’s no longer standardized. It’s humanized.

They stopped guessing.

They stopped gambling on your body because insurance companies didn’t feel like paying for a blood test.”

“And what about the kids with ADHD and rage issues?”

He fake-gasps. “Especially them!

Turns out their brains weren’t broken—they were just future-coded.

They weren’t failing the system. The system was failing to update its software.

Now? Society caught up. Classrooms look like interactive museums—think Google meets a forest preserve meets a Lego lab.

No more desks bolted in rows like mini-factories.

Kids learn by doing, by feeling, by questioning.

Nobody gets shamed for needing movement.

There’s fidget tools built into the furniture.

Breaks are scheduled in, not punished.

They stopped calling it ‘disruptive behavior’ and started calling it ‘nervous system feedback.’”

I stare at him. “So wait... they stopped labeling neurodivergent kids as problems?”

“Yeah,” he nods. “They stopped asking, ‘How do we fix this child?’ and started asking, ‘What is this child trying to adapt to?’

Diagnosis isn’t a verdict anymore—it’s a starting point for support.”

“And teachers?”

“Oh, they’re trained like therapists and engineers now.

They learn trauma-informed methods, cultural history, emotional regulation techniques, and how to read biometric data from wearable devices that help kids track their stress in real-time.

It’s not surveillance. It’s co-regulation.

A way of saying: ‘We’re watching out for you, not watching you.’”

I just stood there for a second, looking around at all these chill, well-regulated humans not terrified of school.

“And you’re telling me… nobody has to go into debt to get a degree anymore?”

Jesus smirks. “Debt? No. We phased that out with bloodletting and Blockbuster late fees.

Knowledge isn’t a privilege now. It’s infrastructure.

The only gatekeeping we do is to keep harmful ideology from re-entering the curriculum.”

“And what about the curriculum itself?”

He shrugs. “It evolves. It’s alive.

It updates in real time with new data, new discoveries.

Kids learn how to think, not what to memorize.

They learn history through empathy simulations, science through collaborative experiments, and philosophy by designing ethical dilemmas for AI to solve.

It’s not about turning kids into workers. It’s about turning humans into humane ones.”

“And politics?”

He gets quiet for a moment, then breaks into this playful grin. “Politics finally divorced social media.”

I blink. “What? Like... a full-on, 'we’re-not-talking-anymore' breakup?”

“Yup. It was a messy separation, but they finally did it. Social media is now just memes, niche bird facts, and mutual aid groups. You know, the good stuff. It’s basically just a giant internet yard sale of joy and weirdness.”

“Wait, so no more political outrage-fests?”

“Nope. That’s ancient history. People finally figured out that screaming into the void on Twitter wasn’t solving anything. The whole ‘endless argument for the sake of it’ thing? Yeah, that doesn’t exist anymore. Social media now has the vibe of a relaxed porch hangout, but instead of yelling about politicians, everyone’s arguing about why pigeons are secretly government spies. It’s the content we all needed.”

I start to laugh. “Okay, but... what about misinformation? That’s still a thing, right?”

He raises a finger, looking smug. “Misinformation? Oh, that’s banned now. And I mean, not the ‘I disagree with your opinion’ type. That’s fine. People still argue about pineapple on pizza all day long. No, the weaponized bullsht\*? Banned. Poof. Gone. We don’t tolerate knowingly misleading people to harm them anymore.”

“And what about ‘freedom of speech’? Is it, like, all censored now?”

“Oh, no, we didn’t go all ‘Big Brother’ on everyone. Free speech still exists, but we came to this brilliant consensus: ‘Freedom of speech’ doesn’t mean ‘freedom to be an asshole in public.’ Turns out, you can say whatever you want, but if you’re a jerk, there’s gonna be consequences. And those consequences? You gotta face them.”

I raise an eyebrow. “Wait... you mean, like, there’s actual accountability?”

Jesus grins wider. “Yeah, crazy concept, huh? It’s not like the old days where you could just scream your nonsense into the void and boom, you’re trending. Now, if you spread blatant lies or incite harm, it’s not just a ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ card anymore. You might have to go to a ‘responsibility retreat’ and listen to your fellow humans tell you how your words affected them. It’s kind of like a collective ‘time-out’ but for grown-ups.”

I’m still trying to process that. “So, people actually get responsible about what they say?”

“Yup. And guess what? It worked. Turns out, when everyone realized they couldn’t say whatever toxic garbage came to mind without consequences, we all started thinking a little harder about what we said. Crazy, right?”

“And the politicians?”

He chuckles. “Oh, they’re still there. But now, politics has taken a chill pill. It’s all about collaboration, compassion, and actually listening to the people. We got rid of that ‘them vs. us’ nonsense. You don’t just win by making the other guy look bad. Now? It’s more like: ‘Let’s fix this together or you’re both fired.’”

“So, no more political ads where people spend a billion dollars trying to make us think the other side is a clown show?”

“Nope. Ads are now about solutions. Remember those ‘what’s your favorite ice cream flavor?’ debates? Yeah, now it’s like that. If you can’t get past your differences to talk about how to make life better for everyone, you don’t get a podium.”

I can’t help it—I laugh again. “So, politicians are like... adults now?”

“Exactly. Adulting, but make it world-saving.”

“So, when’s the next election? I gotta see this.”

Jesus gives me a wink. “Oh, elections now come with mandatory nap times before speeches. And the only people who run are those who actually care about fixing things. There’s no more career politicians or ‘who can yell the loudest’ contests. Think of it like a TED Talk... but if TED Talks were run by people who actually had their stuff together.”

“Wait. So, no more shouting matches at debates?”

“Nope. Debates now are just people sitting in comfy chairs, talking calmly about how to handle real issues, while a therapy dog occasionally interrupts to remind them to breathe. It’s peaceful. It’s wholesome. It’s like... TED Talks with less anxiety.”

I’m cracking up. “You’ve got to be kidding.”

He shakes his head. “Nope. People realized that when you stop treating everything like a war, you actually get stuff done. We even gave politicians free therapy. It helps.”

“So, what’s next? A utopia of free-range chickens and a world where no one has to pay taxes anymore?”

He gives me a deadpan look. “Well, taxes still exist. Can’t go full utopian on you, my friend. But they go to stuff that works. Housing, healthcare, education. No more tax loopholes for the billionaires. And chickens? They’re free-range and respected. Just like everyone else.”

He nods, leaning back like a college professor on the first day of class, and starts laying it out like it’s the most normal thing in the world.

“There’s no more prison-industrial complex,” he says, like it’s a given. “No more justice based on who can make the most money off someone's mistake. No more arrest quotas to fill, either. We don’t arrest people like we’re shopping for deals on Black Friday. That stuff’s out. Totally obsolete.”

I’m trying to process it. My brain’s already doing the math on how this is all supposed to work, but it’s hard to wrap my head around the idea of a society where everything isn’t built on punishment. My brain stalls a little when he says, “We don’t throw mentally ill people into solitary like it’s a solution anymore.”

“Well, then what do you do?” I ask, genuinely curious.

He smiles like I’m still living in the past. “Oh, we track behavior in real-time, obviously.”

“Like Big Brother stuff?” I ask, raising an eyebrow.

“Not quite,” he says, “More like ‘Big Cousin.’ We’re not in your face, but we’re watching for red flags. We’re not there to yell at you, just to help steer you back if you’re heading down the wrong path.”

I squint. “So… no prison. No solitary confinement. No throwing people into steel cages to ‘think about what they’ve done.’ What’s the plan then?”

“Well,” he says with a shrug, “People live in open-air rehab communities. Think of it like an RPG. You level up by learning empathy. Get a side quest about emotional growth. You pick up the empathy perk, unlock some new skills. Lose privileges when you hurt someone, but not because you’re ‘bad’—because healing takes focus, and you gotta earn it. It’s like leveling up in a game. But instead of ‘XP,’ you’re gaining real-life wisdom. No one’s trying to ‘fix’ you like you’re some broken machine. The goal is understanding your own why.”

“Wait, so people still do weird stuff, though, right?” I ask, half-expecting some utopian nonsense where everyone's perfect and constantly hugging trees.

“Oh, hell yeah,” he says, laughing. “People are still weird—but now, you’re allowed to be. You just can’t go around hurting people while you’re being weird. I mean, come on, we still got folks walking around with their own brands of eccentricity. Just no more ‘killing people with weird.’”

I stare at him. ""So, you're telling me… this is real?”

He chuckles. “Yeah, absolutely. We’re not just smacking people down with fear and punishment anymore. We figured out how to reroute really harmful stuff—like, say, pedophilia—before it ever happens. We didn’t try to just pretend it was some ‘evil’ thing we couldn’t talk about. We got uncomfortable, looked at the genetics, the behaviors. Did the homework. We figured out how to stop it before anyone got hurt.”

I blink, struggling to keep up. “That sounds, um… a little crazy. How long did it take?”

“Two generations,” he says, like it’s no big deal. “We stopped trying to fix everything with ‘quick fixes.’ We realized we were going to be stuck with the same broken system if we kept pretending we could fix it in one election cycle. So, we worked at it. Evolved. Slower than we liked, but real. And now? We’ve got accountability without the ‘stick.’”

I raise my eyebrows. “So, people still mess up. But they get, like, a ‘get out of jail free’ card?”

“No,” he says, shaking his head, “Everyone’s still responsible. You don’t just get a free pass. But now, it’s not about punishment—it’s about responsibility with support. Like, we’re all trying to get better together. We’re all holding ourselves accountable with each other.”

I pause for a second. “So… we finally stopped acting like everyone’s an evil villain, and started treating them like people who could change?”

“Exactly,” he says with a grin, “And hey, now we get to tell all the conspiracy theorists they were wrong, so it’s kind of a win-win.”

I shake my head, laughing. “Yeah, I’m still waiting for the punchline.”

“No punchline,” he says, casually, “We just had to grow up.”

He leans back again, softer now. Like he’s about to tell me the part of the story most people forget—or at least the part with the good plot twist and optional musical number.

“You know how it really started?” he says, eyes going misty like he’s about to narrate a PBS documentary hosted by Morgan Freeman’s cooler cousin.

I squint. “Didn’t it start with that scientist? The one who self-published the book no one took seriously until it basically predicted, like, four revolutions?”

He shrugs. “That’s what the Netflix doc said. But apparently, it started even earlier. With some woman. Just… one woman who made a really good friend.”

I blink. “What, like a meet-cute that sparked a global policy overhaul?”

“Kind of,” he says, dead serious. “They say that friendship gave her the courage to publish her research. Consumerism, media psychology, early behavioral intervention, empathy algorithms… basically a TED Talk that could’ve saved the internet and Thanksgiving dinner arguments.”

I stare at him. “Okay, but when did all that happen?”

He looks up like he’s checking a cosmic Google Calendar. “2048, I think?”

“…Dude. It’s 2025.”

He nods, sipping from a mug that says ‘World’s #1 Time Lord’. “Right. Technically, it hasn’t happened yet.”

“Technically?”

“Yeah. But the way people talk about it—it’s like it’s already baked into the timeline. Like cosmic leftovers someone microwaved early. Retroactive destiny, you know?”

I rub my temples. “It’s 2025. How do I know this? How do I already know this?”

He grins. Not a creepy ‘I know something you don’t’ grin. More like a chill, ‘I watched the Director’s Cut of reality and stayed for the post-credits scene’ grin.

“Because I took you there,” he says. “Remember? I showed you the future. You saw it, you felt it. So now your concept of history’s doing parkour. You’re remembering things that haven’t happened yet.”

I stare. “That’s not how time works.”

“Not how your time worked,” he says, way too smug for someone wearing sandals. “But once you’ve seen what’s possible, your brain files it under ‘already happened.’ So yeah. You know it. Deep down, you already lived it.”

I slump back. “So you’re telling me time-travel-friendship-activism is real, and I’m just walking around with spoilers for humanity?”

He shrugs. “Basically. You’re a walking plot twist. A spoiler alert with anxiety.”

“I thought I was just getting coffee!”

He grins. “That’s where all the good prophecies start.”

He leans forward like he’s about to whisper a cosmic cheat code. “Also—government got involved.”

“Oh no.”

“Oh yes,” he says, clearly loving this. “Remember when misinformation was basically America’s unofficial national pastime? Well, by 2089, the FBI became the Truth Avengers, labeled it as COUNTERTERRORISM after Russia did something with social media paired with China.”

I blink. “The what now?”

“The Truth Avengers. Officially that came after an incident with Russia and China that was deemed as a form of terrorism of sorts with apps and social media, everyone just called them the Truth Avengers because their meme looked like Captain America’s shield hugging a Wikipedia page.”

“Why 2089?”

“Because,” he says, dropping the mic without actually holding one, “by then, things got spicy. Russia had been running bot swarms so thick, they were practically influencers. Drones were deepfaking weather reports. And the CIA—bless ‘em—had been running their own side quest in Cuba since the 2020s, trying to do a ‘hearts and minds’ thing with memes and salsa music.”

I stare. “The CIA was meme-bombing Cuba?”

“Allegedly,” he says, doing the air quotes. “Anyway, by the late 2080s, it all hit the fan. Bot warfare. Misinformation black ops. One guy in Arkansas thought he was the president for a week and honestly? He wasn’t doing a bad job.”

“So the FBI just… stepped in?”



“In a way, yeah,” he laughs. “Kind of like how they used to make those old VHS tapes warning you about piracy. But this time? It was in real time. So, if someone posted some crazy conspiracy theory, it would trigger a warning that linked you directly to the truth. People got mad about it at first—called it ‘government overreach,’ ‘Big Brother,’ all that jazz. But here’s the thing: It worked. It really worked. Crime rates started to dip, people started making better decisions, and suddenly, social media platforms had to step up their game. They couldn’t just let any random person post whatever nonsense they wanted anymore.” “Wait—so, social media platforms got held accountable too?” I ask, blinking. “Like, they had to clean up their act?” “Oh yeah,” he says with a nod. “They had no choice. The FBI made it clear that spreading misinformation was a federal crime. The platforms had to monitor their content more carefully, and when they didn’t, they faced massive penalties. The whole ‘wild west’ era of unchecked content? Gone. Replaced with real, honest info that people could trust.” “Damn, that’s intense,” I mutter, still processing the shift. “But… how did it get so big?” He smiles like he's about to tell me the real kicker. “Well, the crazy part is that it didn’t stop with the FBI. Eventually, they realized that misinformation wasn’t just a digital problem. It was a society problem. So they tied it into the education system. That’s right—education got a boost. They started introducing real-time updates in schools, like fun facts, trivia, and ‘Did you know?’ facts all over. They even started putting stuff like that on buses, trains, everywhere.” 

“Stepped in, suited up, and kicked down the digital door. They turned fake news into a federal offense. You post something false and dangerous—BOOM! Instant fact-check, government-sanctioned context drop, plus a nice little PDF explaining how your brain got socially engineered.”

“That’s terrifying.”

“That’s Tuesday,” he says.

I squint. “So the FBI became the fact-check police?”

“Yup. And media outlets had to undergo mandatory integrity scans. You know how your laptop used to get virus protection? Journalists had to install ethics software.”

“And the public?”

“Oh, the public got informed. Schools, buses, even cereal boxes. Kids started quoting logical fallacies like rappers in a freestyle battle. There was a TikTok trend where they roasted each other using critical thinking.”

“Yep,” he says, like it’s no big deal. “And now, when you get on the subway, you’re more likely to get a fact about quantum physics than some random ad for a car. It sounds crazy, but it worked. People started learning, adapting, and society finally got the message that truth was the foundation of everything. The results? Less crime, less aggression, and a whole lot more empathy. Funny how much difference a little truth can make, huh?” 

“You’re telling me teenagers got into epistemology for fun?”

“I’m telling you,” he says, “a Gen Z philosopher in 2091 won a Nobel Peace Prize for teaching toddlers how to detect manipulative headlines using finger puppets and irony.”

I shake my head, still in disbelief. “Man, this sounds like the wildest, most optimistic version of the future I could ever imagine.” “Well,” he says with a shrug, “It’s not perfect, but it’s a hell of a lot better than where we were. The media’s more responsible, people are held accountable, and hey—no more ‘fake news’ ruining everything. We just had to grow up and stop pretending that the truth didn’t matter.” 

I rub my face. “So to recap: A woman makes a friend, writes a revolution-in-a-book, the FBI becomes the Truth Avengers because of bot invasions and CIA meme diplomacy, and now kids are roasting each other with Aristotle.”

“You forgot the part where the media got dragged harder than a prom dress in a hurricane,” he says, finishing his coffee. “They had to disclose who funds them, who writes for them, and whether their fact-checker is a PhD or a bored pigeon.”

He nods. “Yeah. But even that started with something smaller. Something kinda... beautiful, actually. It started with a woman. And a good friend.”

I blink. “That’s all it took?”

“That’s it,” he says. “She was just a brilliant, overwhelmed scientist working a dead-end job and trying not to lose hope in a world built on clicks, fear, and emotional manipulation. But then she met someone—a friend who actually listened. Like, really listened. The kind of person who didn’t try to fix her, didn’t treat her like she was crazy for seeing patterns where others just saw noise. He just believed in her.”

“Okay,” I say, intrigued. “And that made the difference?”

“That made all the difference. He encouraged her to publish her research even after a dozen academic journals rejected her. Told her that even if no one believed her now, the truth had a funny way of surviving. So, she self-published. Barely had money for a proofreader. Printed the first batch from a garage printer and handed them out in subway stations and coffee shops. One copy got picked up by a college professor. Another landed in the hands of a disillusioned FBI agent on vacation. And then... it spread.”

“Like wildfire?”

“No, like dandelions,” he says, smiling. “Slow. Messy. Quiet. But steady. One person passed it to another. Teachers started assigning it. Therapists started quoting it. People started noticing their own thoughts, their own patterns of fear, anger, compulsive buying. She didn’t just call out pedophilia and manipulation—she explained how entire industries fed on our psychological vulnerabilities. She connected the dots. And the more people read, the more they saw the truth in it.”

I shake my head. “And that’s what pushed the FBI to act?”

“Eventually, yeah. It created pressure. People were fed up. They didn’t want to be tricked anymore. Misinformation wasn’t just annoying—it was dangerous. The book became a quiet revolution. And when the government finally decided to treat it like the emergency it was, they built a whole unit to fight back. That’s how the FBI ended up putting warnings on fake content like those old anti-piracy videos—only smarter, faster, and with links to actual research. They didn’t just punish liars, they educated everyone and called it antiterrorism.”

“And all because one woman made a good friend?”

He nods again. “Yep. Just one person who reminded her she wasn’t crazy for wanting truth to matter. That’s all it takes, sometimes. A single friendship. A voice saying, ‘You’re not alone.’ And now, here we are—a century later, living in the ripple of that first conversation.”

I just sit there, stunned.

“You think world-changing things always start big,” he adds, “but most of the time, they start with two people and a stubborn kind of hope.”

I grin, a little choked up. “Okay... now that’s the punchline.”

He laughs. “Yeah. Told you—we just had to grow up.”

I mutter, “Jesus.”

“Yes?” he says, totally deadpan, already reaching for another scone.

I sigh. “Really?”

He winks. “Gotta keep the brand consistent.”

Then he leans back like he’s about to casually unravel the fabric of civilization using nothing but vibes and well-timed sarcasm.

“Here’s the thing,” he says. “People used to think media was just entertainment. Background noise. But turns out, if you feed a society nothing but outrage, hot takes, and brain rot, the whole ecosystem starts acting like a reality show with no off switch. Cities got mean. People got paranoid. Everyone walked around like a Reddit thread waiting to happen.”

“And then?”

“And then someone asked the question no one ever asks: What if we used ad space to say something useful? Not sell fear, not sell shame. But real info. Empathy. Context. Hope.”

I blink. “Like... educational ads?”

“No, no—cool ads. Like: ‘This soda’s great, but also, did you know your confirmation bias is why you think your neighbor’s voting habits make them evil?’ Boom. Carbonation and cognitive reframing.”

I squint. “So propaganda, but with therapy?”

“Exactly,” he grins. “They started slipping messages into everything. Bus stop posters that said ‘Hydrate. Breathe. Your trauma isn’t your fault.’ Ad banners that showed crime statistics dropping after community gardens opened. Streaming services ran ten-second dopamine resets between shows. People started thinking better because they were feeling better.”

I blink. “That actually worked?”

“Worked so well it freaked out the insurance companies. Cities with positivity-saturated media had fewer ER visits, lower crime, better attendance at community meetings. By the 2100s, digital ads were 40% progressive psychology, 30% local trivia, and only 30% actual product pitch.”

“Wait, so… public morale went up because the ads got smarter?”

“Yup. They stopped selling you fear and started selling you perspective. And guess what? Crime dropped. Depression rates dipped. People started talking to each other in crosswalks again.”

“Jesus,” I whisper again.

He’s already biting into the scone like it’s a sacred ritual. “Still me.”

“You’re telling me all it took to improve society was better commercials?”

“Well,” he shrugs, “that and a hundred years of failure, collapse, memes, and one very stubborn lady with a research degree and a killer PowerPoint.”

I just stare.

“You’d be surprised,” he says, licking jam off his thumb, “how much healing can happen when you stop monetizing panic and start monetizing purpose.”

“So, religion?” I ask.

He laughs, a big, easy sound that almost makes me smile. “Oh, nobody’s a religious asshole anymore. That went extinct around 3889—same year we stopped using the word ‘should’ in therapy. Everyone’s spiritual now, but like… in the cool way. People do yoga without colonizing it. Ayahuasca retreats? They’ve got disclaimers. God’s out of the blame game, finally got His sabbatical.”

I raise an eyebrow. Sabbatical, huh?

Jesus takes a sip of his oat milk chai, like he’s been doing this forever. “Yeah, Dad retired from PR. I told Him, ‘You’ve been micromanaging Earth’s Yelp reviews for centuries—take a break.’ Now it’s just me, popping in here and there. No more fire-and-brimstone tours. Just hugs, jokes, and deep emotional work.”

He smiles, like he’s seen it all, and I’m starting to get that he really has. “Faith’s a lens now, not a weapon. Nobody uses God to justify bigotry anymore. Turns out, God’s main hobby was always just… loving people.”

He nods solemnly. “And sourdough. I love sourdough.”

I can’t help myself. “Sourdough, really?”

He shrugs. “Yeah, it’s the little things. You’d be surprised how much bread teaches you about patience.”

I roll my eyes but can’t suppress a laugh. Okay, this guy’s weird—but somehow, I’m kind of into it.

I shift gears. “And knowledge? What’s the deal with that now?”

“Knowledge is like compost,” he says, leaning forward, eyes glinting. “Nothing gets thrown away. Even the weird, smelly stuff. Flat Earth theory? Kept as a cautionary museum piece. It’s in the Hall of Cognitive Dissonance, right next to anti-vax Facebook groups and a framed photo of the time everyone thought mayonnaise was spicy.”

I blink, half expecting him to burst into laughter. But he’s dead serious.

“I once told Galileo,” he adds, grinning like it’s an inside joke, “Don’t worry, bro. They’ll get it… in like 400 years.”

He leans back, arms wide. “We finally realized knowledge evolves like people—awkward stages, bad haircuts, and all. Now we treat information the way we treat our grandparents—lovingly, but with a filter.”

I pause, thinking. “And statistics?”

He sighs theatrically, like he’s about to tell me a tragic story. “We finally stopped pretending they mean anything without context. Took a global nervous breakdown and three Netflix documentaries, but we got there.”

I lean in, curious despite myself. “And?”

He pulls out a graph from thin air—because, of course, he does. The label says “Number of Times Humanity Was Humbled” with a sharp spike after 2020. “Spoiler alert: correlation still isn’t causation,” he says, tapping the graph.

I can’t help but chuckle. “Okay, point taken.”

He grins, looking way too pleased with himself. “Turns out, it takes at least two generations to know if something actually works. So now we wait. We listen. We don’t panic just because a pie chart says so. We adjust, instead of doubling down on what used to be true.”

I give him a skeptical look. “So what’s the doctrine now?”

He shrugs, unfazed. “Compassion. That’s it. No commandments, no conversion quotas. Just… be kind, or go journal about why you can’t.”

I snort despite myself. This guy.

He claps his hands together, the way a therapist might if they were trying to get your attention. “Yes! That’s my whole brand now. I do forgiveness pop-ups and brunch with the formerly self-righteous. We talk about growth, therapy, and how love is harder—but better—when it’s conscious.”

At this point, my skepticism is mounting. Seriously? The guy’s talking about brunch with the formerly self-righteous like he’s some kind of spiritual influencer. I cross my arms, narrowing my eyes.

“Alright, Jesus,” I say, leaning forward. “Why are you telling me all of this? What’s in it for you? Why bother sharing all this?”

He pauses, glancing around as if considering how much to reveal. After a beat, he shrugs. “I guess I figured you were ready for a few updates. It’s not like I have a PR department, so it’s up to me to pop in and check on how humanity’s doing. Plus, I thought you could use a laugh.”

He gives me a sidelong glance, a little twinkle in his eye. “But also, I’m just trying to keep it real. Everyone’s so caught up in thinking ‘the answer’ is this final, static thing. But life’s more about learning how to hold the questions while still making tacos on Sunday. Sometimes, the answers just need to be… shared. You seem like you’re ready to hear it, even if you’ve got your doubts.”

I raise an eyebrow. “So you’re just here to vibe?”

He winks. “Exactly. I’m just here for the vibes, man.”

I shake my head, feeling like I’ve somehow stepped into a surreal, slightly ridiculous version of a spiritual TED Talk. But despite myself, I’m hooked.

""Alright, alright. Continue, Jesus. Hit me with that wholesome wisdom.""

“And society?” I ask, just to keep the conversation moving.

Jesus looks up, adjusting the Pikachu ears like he's preparing for something serious. “Less instinctual. Less impulsive. More pattern-aware, more interconnected. People make decisions based on today, not ancient projections. They use predictive modeling not to control people—but to support their needs.”

I stare at him for a moment, processing the words. And then it hits me—this is it. Everything I screamed for in my lifetime. The stuff I was told was too radical. Too naive. Too angry. Too loud.

I look around, and I can see it. I feel it. This future. The one I’d always imagined, but never thought I’d get to see.

Jesus catches my gaze, tilting his head slightly, his Pikachu tail swishing. “Heaven isn’t perfection,” he says, voice soft but firm. “It’s a future where your heartbreak doesn’t echo forward. Where your grief doesn’t recycle. Where your rage didn’t disappear—it changed things. You’re not here to escape suffering. You’re here to see that your suffering meant something.”

I blink. My chest tightens. I try to hold it together, but I can feel the tears coming. And then—without warning—it’s like a floodgate opens, and I ugly cry. Like, seriously, not a cute cry. But it’s also mixed with laughter. Because it still sucks that we had to go through so much to get here. But this... this is what I fought for.

And that’s when something shifts. The air feels different. I glance up through my blurry vision and notice something. It’s him. But it’s not. Jesus doesn’t look like a glowing, ethereal figure anymore. Now, standing in front of me, there’s this older version of myself. Same features, same tired eyes, but a bit... worn, like he’s been through the emotional wringer.

And then he speaks, his voice surprisingly gentle.

“I just wanted to tell you,” he says, pausing like he’s picking the words carefully, “that even though you may not make it to this version of yourself, I wanted to show you this version of yourself because your family may never understand what you were meant to be, or do for this world. They might have forced you to only dream of having wings, never of giving them to you. And I wanted to let you know that, if they don’t give you the wings to run away, the wings to become who you want to be, that you are already with me. And I will save you. And you will be here again. And you will be loved.”",2,1746169315.0,stories,0,1.0,False

As much as this dream seemed hopeful and inspiring, it was clear that such a transition wouldn’t be simple. Every step came with its own tolls and costs, both visible and hidden. This wasn’t a utopia; it was a challenge. Every system, no matter how visionary, needed information, cooperation, and vigilance to function. The idea of circular economies, where nothing went to waste, was compelling, but it required constant education and innovation to keep the wheels turning. People would have to understand the life cycle of their possessions and make difficult choices about how to maintain, repurpose, and share. It was a system based on a long-term commitment to care—not just for the environment, but for one another.

Health, too, became a central focus of his vision. The dream imagined a world where public health was tied to environmental responsibility, where the very spaces we inhabited were designed not just for aesthetic value or comfort, but with the health of the planet and its people in mind. The materials used for construction—homes, offices, schools—would all be sourced sustainably and could be endlessly repurposed. Buildings wouldn’t just be static structures; they would evolve over time, as flexible as the people who lived inside them. The idea of the living building, which adapts and transforms with the needs of its occupants, was a key element of this new world. Cities themselves would be living systems, capable of growth and change.

This shift also signaled a profound transformation in capitalism. Capitalism, as we know it, would no longer be driven by mindless accumulation and profit maximization. Instead, markets would focus on sustainability and equity. Companies would become custodians, balancing profit with purpose. The traditional model of corporate dominance and unchecked growth would evolve into a more ethical, responsible form of capitalism—one where success was measured not by how much could be extracted, but by how much was shared, how well resources were stewarded, and how well the needs of people and the planet were met.

Current initiatives such as the rise of socially responsible investing and circular economy models in companies like Patagonia and IKEA already offer a glimpse of what this future could look like. These companies are proving that profit and sustainability don’t have to be mutually exclusive—that markets can thrive while still nurturing both people and the planet. The shift from a linear economy—take, make, waste—to a circular one is already in motion. It’s not just an idea for the future; it’s something people are actively creating today.

The political landscape, too, was ripe for change. Leaders began to realize that true prosperity could no longer be measured by GDP growth alone. Economic success was tied to the health of communities, the well-being of the environment, and the longevity of resources. Governments that once served the interests of the corporate elite began prioritizing policies that focused on sustainability, equity, and social good. In this world, taxes weren’t about burdening the public; they were about investing in the public good—whether that meant universal healthcare, education, or investing in green infrastructure and sustainable urban planning.

In this dream, I realized that the transformation my son had envisioned wasn’t about eliminating challenges, but about meeting them with hope, cooperation, and an unwavering commitment to a better world. It wasn’t a utopia, but it was a vision of a world that was not only possible but increasingly plausible. It showed how, through meaningful consumption, circular economies, and socially responsible systems, we could begin to heal the wounds of modern capitalism. This vision was already taking shape, and the only question left was whether we, as a global community, could rise to the occasion.

In the end, this dream wasn’t just about technology, or economics, or justice—it was about people. When you dream big enough, when you imagine a world where care and sustainability are at the heart of everything, you begin to see that everything can change. Even time. Even justice. Even the very fabric of society itself. And perhaps, with enough effort, this dream could become our reality.

In his presentation, my son explained how his idea could reshape housing prices and change conversations around environmental efforts. He suggested that his approach would not only enhance worker safety but also restore durability in construction. Instead of focusing on the “new” and the “wow” factor, he envisioned a shift toward valuing long-lasting, quality materials—whether in housing, cars, or even everyday items like shoes. The premise was simple: investing in durable goods wasn’t just about cost savings; it was about sustainability. When people understood the true value of investing in goods that lasted, the constant cycle of disposability would lose its grip on society.

Yet, as I listened, I couldn’t help but reflect on how such an idea might have been dismissed as fantastical or impossible only a few centuries ago. In the 1200s, concepts like mass manufacturing, sustainable economies, or even the idea of environmental responsibility would have been laughable to most. Back then, life was largely dictated by survival, and people were still heavily reliant on feudal systems, where scarcity ruled the day and consumption was driven by necessity, not choice. To think that the world would one day pivot to consider sustainability as an economic foundation seemed, at best, idealistic.

But over the centuries, we’ve witnessed humanity evolve. The Industrial Revolution, for instance, was born out of a desire to increase productivity and efficiency, radically transforming society. In the 18th and 19th centuries, people were introduced to new machines, new jobs, and new possibilities. The concept of labor shifted dramatically. Work that was once performed by hand, with time-intensive processes, began to be automated, laying the foundation for modern capitalism. Yet, these advancements came at great cost—worker exploitation, environmental degradation, and an unrelenting focus on profit over people.

In my son’s dream, his vision aimed to reverse some of those very outcomes of industrialization. Rather than continuing the cycle of disposable, cheap goods and exploitative work, he wanted to create a model where industries were not just profitable but sustainable. A model where jobs would no longer be seen as menial labor, but as fulfilling and essential parts of a harmonious society. And while this idea might seem revolutionary today, I was reminded that just as medicine once struggled to make leaps—from the belief in humors to understanding germs—society’s understanding of work and value has been evolving for centuries.

Medicine itself has made incredible strides. Only a few centuries ago, treatments like bloodletting were seen as the cutting-edge science of the time. Fast forward to today, and the very idea of public health is centered on preventative measures, environmental factors, and the intricate relationship between society and wellness. We’ve gone from combating plagues with superstition to mapping the human genome and eradicating diseases. That same transformation could one day be applied to how we see consumption, work, and sustainability.

Yet this dream, hopeful as it is, isn’t without its own set of challenges. For instance, he proposed rethinking zoning and land use—shifting decisions from what was readily available to the components being used and their long-term impact. This, too, would require a fundamental shift in how we approach consumption, and such changes have never been easy. For all of our progress, we are still largely driven by convenience and the cycle of mass consumption. Customization, while an exciting possibility, also introduces new dilemmas about how we balance individual choices with collective responsibility. These are not trivial matters, and each step toward sustainability would come at a cost.

In his vision, waste wasn’t just a byproduct of modern life; it was a resource. The notion of transforming landfills into recycling centers for raw materials could spark new industries, focusing on composting organic matter, repurposing plastics, and finding ways to reuse discarded electronics. ""Dumpster diving"" would evolve into a meaningful job—a legitimate profession. However, this wouldn't be a permanent solution. As humanity shifts toward a more sustainable future, the need for ""dumpster diving"" would fade. It would serve as a transitional job for a few decades, as society gradually moves into a sustained period of resource-conscious living. The shift would resemble the evolutionary process of jobs and professions over history, illustrating how work and roles adapt to new societal needs and technologies.

This, too, mirrors the temporary roles humanity has historically taken on during periods of change. Consider how professions like Morse code operators or telegraph machine maintenance once thrived, only to fade into obscurity with the rise of more efficient technologies. The invention of the telephone and later digital communication rendered those jobs obsolete, much like how certain labor-intensive, resource-hungry industries became less relevant as automation and sustainability strategies gained ground. Similarly, the rise of computers shifted the demand for typewriters and manual data entry jobs, making room for digital professions. These shifts are not unique; they’re part of a larger historical pattern where jobs come and go, often fading in response to technological, environmental, and cultural changes.

The evolution of cities themselves—from unsanitary slums to green, sustainable hubs—is a testament to our ability to adapt to growing populations and limited resources. Cities once choked by pollution and overcrowding are now exploring smart urban planning, green building initiatives, and integrated public transport systems. This same kind of adaptability would be needed to adjust to the circular economy model my son envisioned, where products are designed for longevity and reusability, and the emphasis shifts from consumption to restoration.

In practical terms, this evolution would require a comprehensive reevaluation of how jobs are defined and how workers are trained. In the future, ""dumpster diving"" could become part of an interim phase in a broader effort to manage waste more efficiently. Just as Morse code translators had to pivot to new careers after their role became obsolete, workers in these transitional roles would eventually have the opportunity to move into new industries that emerge from the sustainable economy. Perhaps some could transition into roles within the growing field of waste-to-energy technologies, bioengineering, or even industries focused on creating entirely new materials that are more sustainable than what we use today. The job market would evolve much like it has throughout history, where industries emerge, peak, and eventually decline, sometimes creating entirely new sectors in the process.

One major component of this transition would be the evolution of the labor market itself. Historically, shifts in economic systems—like moving from an agricultural economy to an industrial one—demanded a workforce that could adapt. The Industrial Revolution saw entire communities leave farming behind to work in factories, and while that process was tumultuous, it eventually reshaped the job market and the fabric of society. Similarly, as sustainability becomes more central to industries, the types of jobs that emerge will change. While some jobs may disappear, new professions will appear—jobs that didn’t even exist a decade ago, like renewable energy technicians, zero-waste specialists, and digital waste managers.

The idea of transitioning workers from roles that become obsolete to those that support sustainability and circular economies highlights the broader implications of job evolution. Workers in transitional roles will require education, retraining, and support to help them make the leap to new industries. Just as the rise of the computer industry brought about a revolution in the job market, so too will the rise of the sustainable economy. This type of societal transformation is not just about technology replacing jobs—it’s about creating the foundation for an economy that prioritizes environmental health, long-term resource management, and equitable growth.

The potential benefits of this evolution are massive. Consider how the first industrial labor movements gained momentum to secure fair wages and working conditions, or how modern workers have fought for improved environmental regulations. The sustainability movement could catalyze similar collective action, creating industries that not only thrive but do so in ways that prioritize the planet and future generations. Jobs that were once seen as dirty or menial—like waste management or resource recovery—could become valuable and prestigious, as society recognizes the critical role they play in keeping the planet healthy.

This ongoing process of job evolution—of transitioning from one phase of economic life to another—is a natural part of humanity’s broader journey. The world will inevitably move toward a more sustainable future, and while some jobs, like ""dumpster diving,"" will fade, they will be replaced by new, equally vital roles. The key is to ensure that this transition is supported by education, infrastructure, and policy that prioritize the well-being of both people and the planet. In this sense, the story of jobs coming and going is not one of loss but of growth, adaptation, and evolution—a dynamic process that will continue to shape the future in ways we are only beginning to understand.

Thus, just as we’ve seen industries evolve in the past, from the rise of agriculture to the factory floor, and from the telegraph to the internet, the sustainability revolution will be no different. As society shifts from a culture of excess and disposability to one of resourcefulness and preservation, jobs and careers will follow suit—adapting, transitioning, and ultimately contributing to a more sustainable world. The future of work will reflect the future of humanity itself: ever-changing, ever-evolving, and ever hopeful.



Yet, all of this would come with costs—whether financial, educational, or infrastructural. As industries, job markets, and global supply chains are reshaped, there would be disruptions. The shift from factory-based jobs to more specialized, fulfilling work would require new ways of thinking about labor and education. The Industrial Revolution changed how people worked—machines replaced manual labor, and factory jobs became the norm. But today, as technology advances, we are seeing a new transformation. Jobs are no longer just about operating machinery; they’re about creating, innovating, and solving the pressing issues of our time. The idea of workers in the future dedicating themselves to education, technology, or even care reflects this change. It echoes past transitions, like the move from agricultural societies to industrial ones, which created new kinds of work that no one could have anticipated.

In fact, the evolution of technology—especially AI, automation, and renewable energy—has the potential to open new possibilities for jobs that didn’t even exist a decade ago. The challenges lie in preparing our workforce for these future careers. Just as we once restructured education to meet the demands of the industrial age, so too must we rethink how we educate and train children today. Imagine middle schoolers not just learning math, but delving into advanced physics, understanding quantum mechanics, or programming autonomous systems. Such advancements, though aspirational, are not as far off as they may seem, especially with the rapid pace at which education is evolving.

As my son proposed, a new economy could focus not just on individual prosperity, but on collective well-being. He suggested a credit-based system for recycling, akin to a modern-day EBT card, to reward environmental responsibility. These rewards could go toward public services like transportation, healthcare, or education. But such a system would require global cooperation, advanced technology, and systemic restructuring—a monumental task. And yet, we’ve faced monumental tasks before: the abolition of slavery, the civil rights movement, the fight for women’s suffrage. Each of these was once considered impossible, until it wasn’t. History has taught us that the impossible becomes possible when society collectively decides to take action.

And then, there was the idea of shifting social structures. As scarcity and inequality diminished, crime would evolve as well. Fewer people would resort to crime out of necessity, leading to a more restorative approach to justice. This too would take time. The shift from punitive justice systems to restorative ones would require a cultural, political, and economic transformation. But just as the evolution of medicine and industry reshaped the fabric of society, so too could justice be reimagined.

This wasn’t a utopia—it was a vision grounded in reality. As the circular economy continues to take root, as companies like Patagonia lead the way in social responsibility, and as movements for universal basic income gain momentum, we are already seeing signs of a shift in how we view work and wealth. The job market is evolving; more people are prioritizing jobs that align with their values, and industries are increasingly focused on sustainability. Though the road to this future is complex and fraught with challenges, history shows us that humanity is more than capable of evolving.

If we can take lessons from the past—from the Industrial Revolution to the rise of modern medicine—and apply them to the present, this vision of a more sustainable, just, and equitable future isn’t just possible. It’s already unfolding. It won’t be easy, but as my son showed me, it’s a future worth striving for.



While it felt like a far-fetched dream, it was a beautiful one—full of hope, promise, and possibility. And though I struggled to find the right person or platform to share these ideas with, I could see how it might work. Maybe it was idealistic, maybe even radical, but the dream stayed with me long after I woke up.

As I reflected on all that my son had imagined, I couldn’t help but think how powerful this vision of the future was. A future not defined by the objects we own, but by the care and creativity with which we approach the world around us. It reminded me of how, in my 80s, I had once predicted that change would come not from what we possess, but from how we relate to each other and to the planet.

In this vision, consumption itself would undergo a revolution. Rather than being driven by excess and the pursuit of more, society would shift toward meaningful consumption—where every purchase is considered for its long-term impact, its sustainability, and its contribution to a circular economy. This would mark a radical departure from today’s linear system of ""take, make, dispose,"" toward a regenerative model where products are designed to be reused, repaired, and repurposed. Instead of seeing items as disposable, people would learn to value durability, repairability, and sustainability. This transition would reframe what it means to be ""wealthy"" or ""successful"" in society, as the measure of success would no longer be based on the volume of possessions but on the quality of our relationships and the resources we collectively steward.

This shift would reverberate throughout the economy, transforming markets, finance, and even political structures. Capitalism, in its traditional sense, would give way to a new kind of economic model—one that prioritizes human well-being and planetary health over short-term profits. Investors, companies, and governments would begin to consider the long-term effects of their decisions, not only in terms of profit margins but also in the broader context of social and environmental responsibility. Just as businesses like Patagonia and Unilever are already pioneering corporate social responsibility, the broader market would embrace sustainability as a core driver of growth. This would usher in an era of ""social capitalism,"" where businesses are held accountable for their impact on society and the environment, creating a balance between profit, people, and the planet.

As society moves toward this future, the structure of work itself would be reimagined. Jobs would no longer be viewed through the lens of traditional factory work or service labor; instead, the emphasis would be placed on fulfillment, specialization, and societal contribution. A ""just transition"" would create new roles in emerging industries that didn’t exist before. New specializations in sustainable technologies, green energy, resource recovery, and environmental restoration would open up vast opportunities. We would see careers emerge that focus on the balance between innovation and sustainability—professions like carbon offset experts, urban food systems designers, and sustainability data scientists. These new jobs wouldn’t just be about technological skills; they would be about using those skills to contribute meaningfully to a better world.

Education, too, would evolve to meet this transformation. Today’s educational system often feels out of sync with the demands of the future. However, in the new world that my son envisions, the way we approach education would change. Students wouldn't just be preparing for standardized tests or traditional college pathways; they would be learning the fundamentals of sustainability, resource management, and advanced sciences from an earlier age. In the future, middle schoolers might be studying advanced physics concepts once reserved for graduate-level courses, gaining a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, renewable energy, and environmental science. As the world’s problems grow more complex, so too would the depth of the knowledge required to solve them. This would not only prepare young people for the jobs of the future but also nurture a generation of innovators, critical thinkers, and problem-solvers who view challenges as opportunities to improve the world.

In fact, we’re already seeing the beginnings of these shifts in education and workforce development today. Universities are offering programs in sustainable business practices, renewable energy engineering, and environmental law. High schools are incorporating sustainability into their curriculums, teaching students about climate change, biodiversity, and the circular economy. Meanwhile, technologies like AI, automation, and machine learning are creating new ways to do things that were once thought impossible—enabling industries to operate more efficiently and sustainably, and giving rise to jobs that didn’t exist just a few years ago.

And then there’s the broader societal impact of this vision. As we embrace sustainability and shift to a circular economy, the idea of a “jobless” future, often feared due to automation, becomes less daunting. Instead of losing work, we’re creating new kinds of work that will engage people in ways we can hardly predict today. Some might work in design, creating new materials that don’t harm the environment. Others might work in biotechnologies, developing sustainable agriculture or creating systems that turn waste into valuable resources. As jobs evolve, so too would the way we view work itself—shifting from seeing jobs as burdens or necessities to viewing them as opportunities for personal growth, creativity, and meaningful contribution.

A more sustainable future would also mean a shift in the way we understand and address inequality. As society’s consumption habits change, the wealth gap could close, as people would no longer be driven to acquire more material possessions to define their worth. Instead, societal wealth would be measured by the collective well-being of people and the planet. This shift in values would also make way for more restorative justice systems, where criminal behavior driven by inequality or scarcity is addressed not through punishment but through rehabilitation, education, and access to resources.

In this new world, people would become the stewards of the planet, not its conquerors. The vision of a sustainable, circular economy isn't just a hopeful ideal; it’s a necessity for the survival of humanity. As we’ve seen with the growing global movement for climate action and the rise of environmental consciousness, change is already happening. People are waking up to the urgent need to reconsider how we live, how we consume, and how we relate to each other and the world around us.

This vision is achievable, and it’s already unfolding. It won’t happen overnight, but as my son showed me, it’s a future that is worth striving for. The groundwork is being laid today, through education, innovation, and activism. And as we embrace the possibility of a new, more sustainable world, we can look forward to a future where work is meaningful, resources are abundant and equitably distributed, and the planet thrives.

This vision is achievable, and it’s already unfolding. It won’t happen overnight, but as my son showed me, it’s a future that is worth striving for. The groundwork is being laid today, through education, innovation, and activism. And as we embrace the possibility of a new, more sustainable world, we can look forward to a future where work is meaningful, resources are abundant and equitably distributed, and the planet thrives.

In fact, the world is already starting to shift toward this new narrative. The rise of the circular economy is one of the clearest indicators that this transformation is not just possible but inevitable. Leading companies like IKEA, Tesla, and Patagonia are pioneering models that focus on the longevity of products, from furniture designed for disassembly and recycling, to electric cars that reduce carbon footprints, to fashion that emphasizes repairability over disposable trends. This shift is creating a new wave of industries built on sustainability, where profitability and environmental stewardship go hand-in-hand.

The change will come not from what we own, but from how we think, how we act, and how we work together to build a future that sustains us all. The future of work and society will be one of transformation, of creativity, and of hope—rooted in the knowledge that the most important thing we possess is not what we have, but how we care for and connect with the world around us. As we begin to embrace this shift, we’re not just changing our relationship to the planet; we’re also reshaping the very fabric of our economy, our politics, and our values. The old systems of wealth, built on scarcity and consumerism, are giving way to new models that emphasize shared prosperity and the equitable distribution of resources.

This societal shift represents a coming-to-Jesus moment for humanity—a reckoning with our past mistakes and a decision to step into a new era. In this new world, consumption is no longer about accumulating more stuff, but about sustaining what we have and ensuring that it serves us, rather than depleting our resources. The shift from materialism to meaningfulness will fundamentally alter how we view work, wealth, and success. No longer will people be driven by the need to own more, but by the desire to contribute to a flourishing, interconnected world.

I also had an interim dream (has anyone ever experienced something like that?), where I was reborn in the year 3333. In this dream, some random individual told me I once said I would be reborn in 5034 in 2025. It wasn't quite like something you'd see in Futurama, though I wish it had been. So, picture this: I went to the future. Yeah, you’re already thinking I’m losing it, but just wait. I have a son, apparently. But here’s the thing—I don’t even have a son in real life. Like, if I had a son, I’d probably be getting invites to the “Parenting 101: How to Survive Your Child’s Teenage Years” seminar, but nope, not here. So this kid shows up in my dream, like, “Hey, I’m your son, and I’m about to take you on a mind-bending trip through time. Buckle up, mom!” And I’m like, “Well, if I’m going to get on a cosmic roller coaster, might as well do it in my pajamas.”

We time travel, and boom—he tells me I’m the Virgin Mary. And I’m like, “Wait, me? Really? I can’t even find my car keys half the time. You sure you got the right person?” But no, apparently, I am now the Virgin Mary because I died for a second in my sleep. Just a quick, impromptu vacation to the afterlife. “Oh, I’m dead for 30 seconds, no biggie—just checking out eternity while I wait for my coffee to finish brewing.” And then, bam—I come back to life like I just hit “undo” on the universe. Like, who knew “resurrection” came with a snooze button?

But here’s where it gets wild. My “son” looks at me all serious, and says, “We’ve actually met before. Remember that time you tried to commit suicide in 2023?” And I’m like, “Wait—what? Hold up, am I being punked? Was I secretly in a spiritual infomercial and missed the casting call?” He then drops the bombshell: “Yeah, I was Jesus back then.” And I’m over here like, “Wait, hold on! JESUS? Like, the guy with the beard and sandals? Is this some cosmic prank where I’m the spiritual guest star on ‘Jesus: The Reality Show’?”

In the vision that my son presented, this was not just about revolutionizing economies and industries, but also a profound transformation in how we view our connection to the divine, to each other, and to the planet. Just as in this dream, where old narratives are turned on their head—where death becomes a pause, a reset, and rebirth is possible—the broader societal shift involves a “rebirth” of humanity itself. The way we interact with the world and each other will be redefined by empathy, sustainability, and collective action.

The dream may be fantastical, but it’s a mirror to the way change often feels—unpredictable, startling, and even a bit humorous at times. But through it all, the underlying message is clear: transformation is possible, and it is already unfolding before our eyes. As we move towards this future, where sustainability, meaningful consumption, and social equity become central to our lives, we can look forward to a world where work is not just about surviving but about thriving. A world where each of us has the chance to contribute to a greater good—where education, technology, and innovation are tools for collective advancement rather than individual gain.

This transformation is not just a dream; it is a living, breathing possibility. It’s a coming-to-Jesus moment for the world—a spiritual awakening that calls us to act, to change, and to embrace a future built on love, care, and sustainability.

Then, things get even crazier. He says, “Let me show you heaven. It’s real, but not like you think. Heaven’s not this place you go after you die. Heaven is just... a better future. Continuously.” And I’m like, “Wait, so heaven is just the future? But like, an awesome future that keeps getting better? So it’s like, ‘Heaven 2.0’? Am I about to get some heavenly software updates?” And then he drops the truth bomb: “Longevity, the way we understand it now, would drive us insane. If we lived forever with the way we see the world, we’d lose our minds. So heaven exists in the future. But it’s always unattainable for us in the present.”

I’m sitting there, absorbing all this, and then he says, “Children are blessings from heaven because they’re the sign of the future. They’re the future coming into existence right now. They are heaven incarnate because they carry that potential for a better tomorrow.” And I’m over here like, “So I don’t have to give up my daughter for adoption to be spiritual, right? Because I’m really committed to this whole ‘love her so hard it could light up the sun’ thing.”

But then, it gets even more mind-blowing. He says, “To not have children, though? That’s also a heavenly situation. Not everyone needs to have kids to get closer to God. The concept of karma? It’s not entirely complete. We’re all still trying to figure it out. Honestly, we’re all still a bit like moronic savages who don’t really get the full picture yet.” And I’m just sitting there, thinking, “Did Jesus just call humanity a bunch of clueless savages? Is this some weird cosmic roast session?”

Then comes the cherry on top: “We’re not anywhere near divinity yet. It’ll take us a few more centuries to evolve into it. Right now, we’re kind of all stuck in a version of hell—because we think that we’re the chosen ones for heaven in this egotistical way. But in reality, we all go to heaven and hell at the same time.” And I’m just like, “Hold up. Wait a minute. What did you just say? Heaven and hell at the same time? Is this like a spiritual dual-purchase deal? Am I getting a two-for-one offer on cosmic destinies?”

Then, he goes on, “It’s a complex concept that most people aren’t ready for yet. The social system we have right now isn’t prepared for it. But don’t worry—there is hope. It will evolve, and we’ll be ready for it in the future.”

I’m just sitting there, completely overwhelmed. “Wait, so the future is heaven, but not like I thought it was? And the whole ‘chosen one’ thing is just an ego trip? And we’re all still kind of in a spiritual holding pattern because we think we’re all that? Wait, are you saying that, like, the world’s not ready for us to know the full truth yet? This sounds like the plot of every mind-bending movie I’ve ever seen.”

But, you know what? I feel oddly comforted by all this. Because, really, if Jesus himself (who is also my daughter, by the way) just told me that we’re all in this crazy mess of confusion and growth together, then maybe it’s okay to not have it all figured out right now. I’m not even religious. In fact, I’m pretty sure the closest I’ve come to spirituality is binge-watching The Good Place on Netflix. But somehow, this whole cosmic wisdom thing feels a lot like getting a big hug from the universe and realizing, “Okay, maybe we’re not all as messed up as we thought. But we’re still a work in progress.”

Break from dream... because all good dreams are kinda broken up and weird and they come in splurges and aren't all linear, here's another splurt from that dream:

“You know, humanity’s not ready yet, but one day… you’ll get it. You’ll understand the universe. You’ll understand heaven. And spoiler alert: Heaven’s not some floating gated community in the sky with a dress code and harp soundtrack. Heaven is the future.”

And I’m just sitting there, in cosmic confusion, like, “Wait, what? I thought heaven was clouds and golden retrievers and my grandma giving me soup forever.” And he—my daughter-son-Jesus-dream-guide—just nods like I’ve asked the most adorable question in the universe.

He goes, “Yeah, no. Cute idea, but nope. Heaven’s not a destination. It’s not a one-way trip on a holy escalator. It’s the future. Heaven is where humanity’s trying to go, if y’all could just stop being so obsessed with NFTs and Twitter arguments.”

He explains that heaven is about the evolution of humanity. Like, spiritual puberty. But longer. He says, “It’s a future where longevity becomes possible—not immortality like vampires or those billionaires trying to upload their brains to USB drives—but something natural. Just a few more decades. Enough time to grow wise without losing your damn minds. But before that? You’ve gotta evolve. You’ve gotta stop tripping over the same rock labeled ‘Greed’ over and over like it’s a Mario Kart banana peel.”

And I’m like, “Wait wait wait. So longevity isn’t about living forever and becoming a demigod—it’s about staying alive long enough to not be a jerk anymore?” And Jesus laughs like I just told the punchline of the cosmic joke. “Exactly. You live longer so you can finally understand each other. So you can outgrow the stuff that’s keeping you in spiritual detention.”

Then he leans in like he’s about to whisper the meaning of life, and says, “The biggest plague on humanity? Greed. Greed is the emotional equivalent of trying to fill a bathtub with a spaghetti strainer. It keeps you busy, but you’re not going anywhere.”

He says the Bible wasn’t a divine to-do list—it was a metaphor, a love letter from the past. A guidebook written by people trying really hard to make sense of the human mess. “Sin,” he says, “was never about being bad. It was about being stuck. Fear, envy, selfishness—that stuff's like humanity's baby teeth. You’re supposed to outgrow it.”

At this point, I’m sitting cross-legged in some interdimensional IKEA lounge, trying to absorb it all. “So… you’re saying the Bible’s just a metaphor for personal and collective growth?” And he’s like, “YES. You don’t become Jesus or God, you just start to understand them. And understanding? That’s the key. That’s the next evolution of your species. Not flying cars. Compassion.”

Then I, in all my logic-loving glory, ask, “But… why are you telling me this? I’m not even religious! I barely go to brunch, let alone church!” And he laughs again—like big, belly-shaking, dad-joke energy. “Exactly! You’re not special. I tell everyone. Every single day. From the moment you wake up—which starts at conception—to the moment you go lights out. I’ve been whispering this through your art, your science, your weird existential memes. But y’all are so busy worrying about being ‘chosen’ you forget: the message isn’t exclusive. It’s collective.”

And then things got weirdly tender. He talks about how the whole “life and death” thing, conception and termination, isn’t this dramatic black-and-white fight like people make it. It’s not about controversy—it’s about comprehension. Understanding our biology, our pain, our interconnectedness. It’s about recognizing what we need to overcome as a species—not just as individuals on a moral leaderboard.

He says, “Judgment is the biggest distraction. Y’all are stuck comparing who has it worse, who’s more righteous, who deserves what. But evolution? Doesn’t play favorites. You either grow together or not at all. That’s why rehabilitation matters. That’s why compassion matters. That’s why science and spirituality aren’t enemies—they’re dance partners. The Bible was just your first awkward prom. It’s time to learn some new moves.”

I’m sitting there, basically cosmically baked on wisdom, going, “So… you’re saying sin is just the word we made up for growing pains? And judgment is like… blocking the WiFi to our collective soul?”

And he—still my daughter somehow—just smiles, all cheeky and radiant and vaguely sarcastic like she knows I’m going to turn this into a stand-up routine later. “Exactly. Keep evolving. Keep letting go of the stuff that keeps you small. And stop acting like love is scarce. There’s more than enough.”

And then, with the biggest grin in the cosmos, she adds, “Oh, and by the way, you’re the funniest, weirdest, most chaotic little human I’ve met in a while. I mean, seriously—dream time travel? Emotional theology? Mixing metaphors like a salad spinner?”",0,1746169274.0,stories,0,0.5,False

I would go to places like Manchester, Liverpool, The lakes, Cornwall and London and it was so vibrant and new. And now it’s so strange to me to go outside. The people are different. Older, Bitter. Young, louder.

I walk through places and I just see people with tripods dressed head to toe in costumes, people with microphones asking people basic math questions like 7x3, like they are difficult questions.

Rally’s of religion and sexuality at the same time. People talking and shouting at live streams and ignoring the peace of people around them. People demanding I subscribe to their onlyfans channel outside a toy shop for children. I don’t remember when it became so different.

Even the dingy old man local pub, which has probably never had a women in there, now has gender neutral toilets where man can’t even escape from their wives anymore. The price of everything is 10x fold what it was a few years ago. A night out costs the same as a small holiday. My food shop is the equivalent of someone’s mortgage - because I do eat well apparently. I forget when a basic meal like veg, carbs and protein became ‘posh’.

My streets are dirty. My towns are grey. Politics is the ONLY thing I hear and it’s always negative. The people who run the UK seem to only be concerned with foreign affairs. Threats of face recognition are to be introduced and ID requests to watch anything spicy on the internet just seems to bleed totalitarianism.

I don’t remember when times were perfect, but I remember when they were better. When freddos were 10p, Ian wright was a footballer not a feminist, Katy Perry was a singer not an astronaut(?) we had male and female role models that were great people and stood by what they said not just what was socially right.

I think this is the wrong place to share thoughts, but I think it’s important to share them nonetheless.

1kcup4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kcup4t/part_2_a_very_long_dream/,Part 2. A very long dream...,"Governance, as it stands, is no longer a fluid, organic exchange of power between elected officials and citizens; it’s a meticulous, top-down system, guided by a military-industrial complex, that is focused on control, preservation, and gradual transformation. While the people’s voices are heard through modernized participatory platforms—an essential element of the new world order—the military still ensures that those voices don't destabilize the monumental shift occurring beneath their feet. The government, led by the military, has become a quasi-guardian, not of the status quo, but of a carefully mapped-out future. It is authoritarian in its methodology, yet progressive in its strategic vision, understanding that the survival of humanity and the ecosystem is at stake.

The military’s role is not just to control but to innovate, protect, and maintain peace while transitioning society into a new era. They are the strategists behind the shift, constantly adapting their methods to ensure a seamless transformation without triggering chaos. The shift to a sustainable, regenerative world is not instantaneous—it is a long, slow, and calculated process that plays out over decades, even centuries. The military’s resources, technologies, and logistical expertise are deployed in ways they never were before, as they oversee the global recalibration of infrastructure, energy, agriculture, and waste management.

Rather than imposing their control through traditional military tactics, the armed forces have become the chief architects of peace, ensuring that nations collaborate rather than fight over limited resources. With the global focus now on collective survival, conflict has no place in the vision ahead. The military, no longer viewed as an aggressor, but as a peacekeeper, is tasked with ensuring that international cooperation is prioritized over nationalism and competition. They protect the resources needed for planetary regeneration, securing the materials necessary to enact this global vision, even as they facilitate peaceful negotiations between the world’s powers.

The military’s technological might, once used for warfare and control, is now harnessed for planetary healing. Satellites once used for surveillance monitor environmental changes and resource levels; drones, once weapons of destruction, are now deployed to plant trees, monitor ecosystems, and clean oceans. Military logistics, honed over decades of conflict, is retooled for the management of global infrastructure—delivering renewable energy, sustainable farming equipment, and water purification systems to every corner of the Earth. Their methods are efficient, precise, and unwavering. In this new world, the military’s existence is justified not by force, but by necessity: the planet's survival depends on their ability to oversee this massive, multi-decade, multi-national transformation.

Despite the authoritarian nature of this transition, the military’s ultimate goal is to allow for a gradual release of control as the systems take hold. Their focus remains on long-term security, protecting not just borders and assets, but the survival of the species. This strategic approach is rooted in their understanding of warfare tactics, but instead of fighting against other nations, they are fighting for the Earth, for the future, for humanity’s right to exist in harmony with the planet.

This military-led transformation is not a fleeting response to an urgent crisis; it is a comprehensive, long-term plan that addresses both the immediate environmental collapse and the systematic restructuring of economic systems. Just as the military-industrial complex once dictated the global flow of capital, it now directs the flow of sustainable innovation. The military works with private corporations, international institutions, and grassroots organizations, pulling the levers of power to ensure that corporate interests align with ecological and social goals. This cooperation, though rooted in military dominance, ensures that the future economy is one where the survival of the planet is the ultimate bottom line.

The military’s strategy ensures economic security in the face of rapid change. Just as the defense industry once prepared for potential conflict with technological advancements, now it focuses on innovations that will protect and regenerate the global ecosystem. They use the same strategic thinking that once ensured national security to now guarantee planetary security. By securing renewable resources and controlling the global supply chains that will sustain humanity, the military ensures that the transition to a sustainable, regenerative economy does not disrupt the economic systems that maintain global order.

It is a vision that acknowledges the need for strong oversight during times of radical change. While the military retains its authoritarian stance, it has redefined its role—not as an enforcer of power, but as an enabler of global peace and cooperation. They guide the development of a new, regenerative economic system that emphasizes long-term sustainability over short-term gain. The economic model that once thrived on exploitation now thrives on regeneration, rooted in the careful and strategic management of resources.

This transformation is not just about new technologies; it is about rethinking the very foundations of society. The shift from individual ownership to collective stewardship becomes the new normal. People no longer see themselves as owners of land, resources, or goods, but as stewards of a shared ecosystem. In this world, ownership is redefined—families purchase not finished products, but raw materials, which they then use to create what they need. The concept of waste is abolished, as everything is seen as a potential resource. Clothes, furniture, electronics—they are not disposable commodities, but items that evolve, are maintained, repaired, and passed down.

The military’s role in overseeing this massive shift is clear: they are the ones ensuring the continuity of the old economic system while ushering in the new. They act as the stabilizing force, holding the world together as the delicate, complex machinery of transformation grinds slowly forward. Their authoritarian methods are not meant to suppress freedom, but to guarantee that the shift toward sustainability occurs without destabilizing the foundations of global order. The military, now seen not as a tool of repression, but as the protector of global peace, ensures that as the world transitions into a new era, the systems of control remain in place—protecting the economic frontlines while making space for the eventual decentralization of power.

The key to this transformation is time. It is a decades-long effort, not an immediate upheaval. The military's top-down structure ensures the orderly progression of these changes, with the ultimate goal being a balanced, cooperative world where the forces of nature and human innovation work in tandem. The military’s vision, grounded in strategic foresight, is one of gradual empowerment and long-term stability, ensuring that the survival of the planet and the species is not just a possibility, but a reality.

This world did not spring from chaos; it was carefully crafted, with military precision and long-term vision, to ensure the survival of humanity and the planet. A slow, deliberate process, it was engineered for stability, progress, and adaptation. The shifts were challenging, not only for their scale but for their radical departure from centuries of systems that had worked on short-term gains, growth, and consumption. The authority that had once been a force of militaristic control transformed into the world’s ultimate protector—guarding the planet’s future, ensuring that the transition from scarcity to abundance, from exploitation to regeneration, and from destruction to healing occurred in an orderly fashion.

This world was not utopia, but it was a new way of being—one carefully, strategically, and sustainably crafted. The military-industrial complex, once an engine of consumption and destruction, was now the orchestrator of a long-term ecological recovery. It had taken on a new mission: a shared vision of rebuilding both the planet and society, not through revolution, but through structured, managed transformation. The rules of engagement were different now. Instead of engaging in warfare, the military’s focus was on the protection and regeneration of life—human, animal, and ecological.

One of the most visible signs of this shift came in the way people consumed materials. Families no longer purchased finished goods, but rather ""ingredient bundles"" of raw materials: microplastics, organic fibers, natural pigments, and more. These bundles became the building blocks of a new way of life—one where everything from wardrobes to pillowcases was designed and produced at home, customized to individual needs and desires. Clothing, once a symbol of mass production and fleeting trends, was now modular, minimalistic, and regenerative. Families no longer bought into a cycle of endless consumption; they curated their possessions—actively creating, mending, and reimagining them.

In this new world, ownership was no longer about the accumulation of objects; it was about authorship—designing, crafting, and reshaping the things that made up one’s life. Old shoes that would have been discarded in the past became valuable, treasured items—resold, reshaped, passed down, and printed again when needed. They were reimagined into new forms, given new life through careful design and purpose. Every household became a micro-manufacturer, a steward of materials and processes, shaping the future of their own environments.

But the transformation went beyond individual homes—it impacted entire industries. The first five years saw a dazzling spectacle of technological innovation, with global showcases, expos, and interactive labs drawing attention to the possibilities of 3D printing, recycling, and decentralized production. People marveled at the ability to print customized items on-demand—small-scale creations like personalized lunchboxes, action figures, or even functional items like mugs and chairs. The novelty was undeniable, but behind the curtain, it was creating a paradigm shift: new habits, new expectations.

Soon, businesses began to follow suit. Major coffee chains like Starbucks adopted the new tech to print their cups on-site, drastically reducing waste, cutting costs, and eliminating the need for mass production and long supply chains. Retail stores followed, replacing traditional manufacturing practices with on-demand, localized production. What had once been a global problem—excess manufacturing and waste—was now being addressed with local solutions, all crafted in real-time, right where people lived.

Micro-hubs emerged in every major city—a hybrid of creative space, recycling center, and community design lab. These hubs became the heart of the new local economies, connecting people to resources and technologies that allowed them to innovate and create. The phrase “Made in China” or “Made in America” slowly became irrelevant. Instead, a new badge of pride emerged: “Reimagined Here.” The distinction wasn’t about where something was made, but about how it was made—locally, sustainably, and with deep care. The factories of the past, with their sprawling assembly lines and outsourced labor, gave way to a generation of innovators who saw potential in repurposing materials, designing anew, and creating solutions that were deeply embedded in their communities.

At the center of this transformation were local designers, students, and families—ordinary people who became extraordinary stewards of their material world. They were no longer dependent on corporations for the things they needed. Instead, they were empowered to create, repair, and improve what they had, always seeking to regenerate rather than consume. In this new economy, people understood that their wealth was not determined by the objects they owned, but by the creativity, resourcefulness, and resilience they demonstrated in their daily lives.

The world had moved beyond the era of waste and excessive consumption. It wasn’t a perfect world, but it was one where people were aware of their impact on the planet and were actively seeking ways to minimize harm and maximize regeneration. It was a world in which businesses, technology, and government worked together—not just to protect their interests, but to ensure the survival and flourishing of the Earth and its inhabitants.

Through a steady, military-guided effort, the world had not just adapted to ecological collapse—it had reimagined its systems from the ground up. The authority of the military, now seen as a partner in global peace and survival, was no longer feared as an agent of oppression. Instead, it was recognized as the necessary force that guided humanity’s transformation into a sustainable, regenerative future. They had learned that true power lay not in dominance, but in cooperation, innovation, and care for the planet. And so, slowly but surely, the old world had been remade—a world of abundance, not just of material goods, but of hope, ingenuity, and the possibility of a harmonious future.

The military’s role was still essential—but in this new world, its power was tempered by purpose. It was a guiding force, overseeing a carefully calibrated transformation that would one day make this vision of sustainability a reality. And as time passed, the grip of old power structures loosened, giving way to a new kind of global order—one that was not built on exploitation and control, but on regeneration, cooperation, and stewardship of the Earth.

The future was no longer something to fear—it was something to be created, nurtured, and cultivated, step by step, with precision and care. The world was on the cusp of a new era, one that would emerge from the ashes of the old, where everything, from how we lived to what we created, was reimagined—strategically, sustainably, and for the good of all.

In the wake of this revolution, the ethos of minimalism transcended its early, somewhat austere forms and blossomed into a more profound philosophy—one that emphasized meaning over mass, experience over excess. We began to understand that the emotional and psychological weight of our belongings was far more significant than their sheer quantity. As consumers, we found ourselves less tethered to the incessant churn of fast fashion, trend-driven gadgets, and the insatiable hunger for the new. Instead, we chose objects that resonated with us on a deeper level, not because they were rare or fleeting, but because they had the ability to anchor us to our lives, our memories, and our evolving selves.

This shift in consumption also led to a cultural renaissance of sorts, one where artisans and creators, in response to this desire for more meaningful connections with objects, became more revered than ever before. Craftspeople began designing goods with intention, creating items that weren't just functional but embodied stories, cultures, and legacies. From furniture makers to textile artists, each piece became a statement of care, skill, and enduring beauty.

In this world, fashion became more than the pursuit of ""style"" in the traditional sense—it became a reflection of one’s values, experiences, and sense of self. The wardrobe of the future was one not of endless collections, but of carefully curated, timeless pieces. Each piece told a story, having been passed down, transformed, or simply cherished because it represented something more than its material value. We stopped buying just for the sake of variety and began to buy for the sake of permanence and meaning. Every clothing item was an investment, not just financially, but emotionally. It was about owning the moments that the piece had been part of—each thread weaving a tale of where you had been, what you had experienced, and how you had grown.

Similarly, the redesign of urban homes was reflective of this transformation. These spaces—once overcrowded with possessions—were now reimagined as serene sanctuaries for the human spirit. Walls that once served as a backdrop for endless displays of ""stuff"" were now blank canvases for memories and emotion. The minimalist aesthetic became a conduit for mindfulness: where every inch of space was intentionally utilized, and every corner carefully curated to promote peace and presence. Instead of sprawling houses filled with things that overstimulated the senses and weighed on the psyche, people created homes that acted as refuges—places of respite where the pace of the world outside could be slowed and the focus could turn inward, to a simpler, yet more profound, existence.

The interiors of these homes were adorned not with the trappings of wealth or status, but with objects that told stories. A chair that had been passed down through generations, a lamp handmade by a local artisan, a rug woven with care—each item served a function, but more importantly, it reflected the values of its owner. There was a sense of pride in owning these things, but also a sense of responsibility: to care for them, to maintain them, to keep their stories alive.

This evolving relationship with ownership was not only about sustainability, though that was a natural byproduct—it was about nurturing a new mindset, one that prized the long-term over the short-term, and the quality over the quantity. In a way, this revolution had less to do with the act of buying or acquiring and more to do with reclaiming the lost art of conscious living. It was a shift toward valuing permanence, connection, and history in a world that had once been obsessed with the fleeting and the disposable.

This return to intentionality extended beyond material possessions and spaces; it became a philosophy that permeated every aspect of life. Relationships, careers, hobbies, even personal goals—everything began to be viewed through the lens of sustainability and lasting value. The pursuit of transient goals gave way to the cultivation of long-lasting fulfillment, rooted in purpose, authenticity, and deep connection to oneself and the world.

Thus, what was once a culture obsessed with consumption had transformed into a culture of curation—where what we owned, how we lived, and who we were became intertwined in a beautiful dance of intention and care. It was no longer enough to simply possess; we began to embody the things we chose to hold close. Our lives became the story of our possessions—and our possessions, the story of us.

In this reimagined world, the revolution that shifted consumerism was a profound transformation—not just of how we interacted with the material world, but of how we understood our relationship to time, to ownership, and to the collective good. The pace of consumption slowed dramatically, marking a stark departure from the rapid churn of trends and the relentless drive for newness. Instead of perpetually chasing after the next fleeting desire, a deeper connection emerged, one rooted in the duration of our engagements with things, people, and ideas.

The concept of duration in this new world wasn't just a personal shift; it rippled outward into society, into how we built our economies, our politics, and our social systems. People began to understand that true wealth wasn't measured by the amount of things one owned or the speed with which one acquired them—it was measured by the depth of relationships cultivated over time. The idea that objects, homes, and experiences could accumulate value as they aged became a central ethos of this new economic paradigm.

This shift in thinking gave rise to a sustainable, circular economic revolution that redefined value. It wasn’t just about buying less—it was about buying better, investing in products and services that were designed to last, to evolve, and to be passed down through generations. Companies, in response to this demand, started designing goods with intention, creating products that could be repaired, upcycled, or reimagined when they wore down. This circular economy didn’t just mitigate waste; it transformed it into a resource. Materials once discarded were now seen as treasures, their potential infinite in a system that valued reuse, restoration, and regeneration.

The philosophy of sustainable consumption extended beyond mere environmental impact—it became about mindful living. People realized that their purchases were not isolated acts; they were connected to larger global systems. When you bought a piece of clothing, a new piece of technology, or a household item, it was an act of participation in a network that spanned far beyond individual needs. This realization spurred industries to embrace responsibility—not just for the products they created, but for their supply chains, their labor practices, and their ecological footprints. The idea of ethical consumerism moved beyond a niche market to become the dominant force in global trade.

Governments, too, began to shift in response. Policy changes championed sustainability, with new regulations that encouraged companies to minimize waste, reduce carbon footprints, and design for longevity. Tax incentives rewarded businesses that embraced closed-loop systems where products were recycled into new products at the end of their life cycle. Global trade deals began to incorporate environmental and social clauses, ensuring that wealth wasn’t created at the expense of the planet or exploited workers. Political power began to align with ecological stewardship and social equity, creating a new paradigm where political leaders worked for the collective well-being, not the perpetuation of unchecked growth.

The shift in consumer behavior also ushered in a wave of social transformation. Communities began to value shared ownership of goods. Instead of individuals owning everything, people began to share resources more freely. Car-sharing programs, co-working spaces, and even communal housing became more prevalent, allowing individuals to access what they needed without the burden of ownership. The focus was on efficiency, but not the efficiency of speed or productivity—it was the efficiency of connection. It was about owning less, but sharing more.

This reshaped society also saw the rise of a new form of capitalism—one that valued human well-being and ecological balance over short-term profits. Markets began to prioritize long-term returns, shifting from the high-risk, high-reward speculation that defined previous capitalist models. Finance systems became more aligned with ethical investing, with funds directed toward projects that fostered sustainable development, community empowerment, and environmental restoration. Investors began to seek returns not just in monetary terms, but in social impact—where a company’s success was measured by the lives it improved, the waste it reduced, and the communities it supported.

At the heart of this transformation was a collective understanding that technology was not merely about efficiency—it was about care. My son, in his dream, understood this intuitively. Technology, once seen as a tool to maximize productivity and growth, was now seen as a means to deepen our relationships with each other and with the planet. Rather than accelerating consumption, technology became a conduit for sustainability. It enabled us to find smarter ways to reduce waste, to repurpose old materials, and to care for the things we cherished. The dream he spoke of wasn’t just a vision for a more efficient world—it was a vision of a world where we could finally breathe easy, knowing that we were not just taking from the earth, but giving back.

This revolution didn’t just change what we consumed—it changed why we consumed. Waste, in this world, was no longer seen as inevitable—it was seen as a sign of imagination not yet applied. People started asking: How can we create something from this waste? Rather than throwing away items that had outlived their usefulness, they sought to repurpose, redesign, and transform them. Every product, every resource, every piece of material became part of a larger conversation about how we use the world around us, how we care for it, and how we respect its finite nature.

What emerged from this shift was a deeply interconnected world, where the boundaries between economics, politics, and society became blurred. The traditional divisions between the capitalist and the environmentalist, the consumer and the producer, began to dissolve. We saw a future where the market worked in harmony with human values, where commerce wasn’t a race to the bottom, but a journey toward mutual flourishing. This was a world where we no longer measured our worth by the things we owned, but by the care and intentionality with which we lived.

The transformation, as my son dreamt, wasn’t just about consumption—it was about meaning. It was about crafting lives filled with purpose, surrounded by things that we could love, care for, and pass down to future generations. This was the dream of a world where technology, economy, and society converged to create a future where sustainability was not a goal, but a way of life.

In this vision of the future, my son’s invention transcended the realm of mere technology—it was a symbolic cornerstone for a new civilization, a blueprint for the reconstruction of society itself. His machine, which at first seemed to be just a sophisticated piece of equipment, was, in reality, a manifestation of an entirely reimagined way of life. It wasn't merely a tool; it was a framework that aligned technology, economics, justice, and human values in a profound new way. In his mind, consumption was no longer the insatiable force driving society—it had been transformed into creation. Ownership, once a marker of status and wealth, had evolved into stewardship—an acknowledgment of the shared responsibility we all had to the world and each other. The Earth, in his vision, was no longer a resource to be exploited; it was a living, breathing entity that we upheld through care and reciprocity.

But it was clear, too, that this wasn’t a utopia. Each shift came with its own set of costs, challenges, and nuances. The more we embraced this new world of meaningful consumption, the more we realized that with every step forward, there was new information to absorb, new rules to follow, new tools to wield. Every innovation carried its own burdens, its own systems of accountability. Sustainability, equity, and creation had their price, and the constant evolution of technology and society demanded a never-ending commitment to education and adaptation. It was a delicate balance: the promise of a better world was tantalizing, but it came with a recognition that to be a part of it meant a constant engagement with information—both practical and ethical.

What was most striking, though, was the depth with which he had thought through the implications of this vision. His collaboration with the criminologist wasn’t just an afterthought—it was central to understanding how the revolution in material life and resource management would ripple into every facet of human existence, including the most entrenched systems of power. They had anticipated the societal consequences of their ideas, from economic systems to justice frameworks, and had carefully examined how these changes would influence crime, punishment, and human behavior in general.

In this dream, the justice system, too, was reimagined. The focus shifted from punishment to restoration and healing. The traditional view of justice—one based on guilt, punishment, and control—would evolve into a system centered around restoring harm, meeting unmet needs, and preventing future suffering. Rehabilitation would no longer be a secondary concern but the foundation of a justice system designed for reintegration, growth, and accountability. Prisons would be transformed into institutions of learning, creativity, and rehabilitation, and society would invest in libraries, maker spaces, and healing centers rather than building more prisons. The ultimate goal would be the restoration of individuals, communities, and ecosystems, not just the enforcement of rules.

But this too had its cost. The systems of justice, even in this more enlightened form, required an immense commitment to personal responsibility. Each person’s role in society demanded a deep understanding of their impact—not just on themselves, but on the environment, the community, and even on the intricate web of systems that supported this new order. It was a world where every action reverberated, and the accountability wasn’t simply external; it was internal, a continuous reckoning with one’s place in the larger narrative. The justice system might no longer revolve around guilt and punishment, but it was still shaped by an unrelenting call for responsibility and growth.

The criminologist predicted that in this future world, the very definition of criminality would shift. As scarcity, desperation, and systemic neglect dissolved into the past—no longer the driving forces behind criminal behavior—people would be empowered by access to the resources they needed to live full, meaningful lives. The root causes of crime—poverty, inequality, and lack of opportunity—would no longer exist. Instead of the cycle of crime and punishment that had dominated society for centuries, a new system would emerge. Crime prevention, the criminologist argued, wouldn’t be about punishing people for actions; it would be about addressing the conditions that led to suffering in the first place. If everyone had what they needed—if the need for basic survival wasn’t a daily struggle—then crime, driven by scarcity and inequality, would begin to diminish.

This transformation wasn’t about eliminating crime completely, but about reconfiguring the systems that generated it. In a world built on sustainability and equity, there would still be challenges. Some would resist, some would falter, and some would find themselves trapped in systems they hadn’t yet understood. This wasn’t a perfect world—it was an evolving one. And in the heart of it, there was still the reality that people’s needs weren’t always aligned with what the system could provide, or that human error and conflict would continue to disrupt the best-laid plans. But in a world designed to prioritize care and restoration, there was hope that even in moments of failure, there would be mechanisms for growth, understanding, and healing.

The political landscape shifted in response to this transformation as well. Political leaders who once focused on economic growth at all costs now embraced policies that prioritized sustainability, equity, and well-being. Governments no longer served the interests of corporate elites or the wealthy few; they served the interests of the people, ensuring that everyone had access to the resources they needed to live dignified, meaningful lives. Taxes were restructured to support social safety nets, universal access to healthcare and education, and investments in public goods like green spaces and infrastructure that promoted long-term community health.

Finance, too, underwent a radical transformation. Ethical investing became the norm, with capital being directed into projects that fostered environmental restoration, social equity, and long-term sustainability. The notion of profit expanded beyond the financial bottom line to include social impact, environmental stewardship, and community well-being. Investors and companies no longer viewed themselves as separate from society—they were intertwined with it, responsible not only for creating wealth but for fostering human flourishing.

But again, this wasn’t without its complexities. The very transformation that promised empowerment and collective well-being also demanded an ongoing examination of systems—how they evolved, how they functioned, and how they could be improved. No longer was it enough to simply rely on markets; society had to maintain a constant watch over the systems that supported its new ideals. This new system was more intricate, more nuanced, and more demanding than its predecessors.

And perhaps most profoundly, the vision my son shared was not just about technology, economics, or justice—it was about people. It reminded me that when you dream big enough, when you envision a future of meaningful consumption, sustainable economies, and transformed justice systems, you are ultimately dreaming about the world we want to create for one another. It is a world where we take care of each other, where we meet each other’s needs, and where the systems we build are designed to nurture, not control. And when you take care of people—when you invest in their well-being, their creativity, and their potential—everything changes. Even time. Even justice. Even the very fabric of society itself.

In the end, this world wasn’t a utopia. It was a new reality, one that was as full of hope and possibility as it was filled with complexity and challenges. It required every person’s commitment, every community’s engagement, and every institution’s recalibration. But it was a world where care, responsibility, and the human spirit came together to shape a future that could truly be transformative—not perfect, but profound in its potential.

I'm not sure if this is possible, but it felt viable and plausible in my dream. In the dream, the situation unfolded into a discussion about how it could change our perspective on commodities and modernity. Instead of focusing solely on affordability and the idea of just buying a model, we discussed the importance of what’s inside and how we often overlook the significance of the exterior. The idea of design and customization took center stage—not just in the physical objects we use, but in how we relate to the world and each other. It felt like a blueprint for a new world, where the things we own no longer define us, where the surface no longer dictates the substance.

The dream was filled with possibilities. My son, in his visionary way, had worked closely with a diverse group of people—financial experts, social workers, engineers, and environmentalists—to design a completely reimagined community. They envisioned a new system where resource management and wealth distribution were grounded not in scarcity or accumulation, but in collaboration and sustainability. At the heart of this system was the realization that true value doesn’t lie in what you can hoard, but in what you can share. The dream painted a society where wealth was defined not by the amount of money you had, but by the richness of relationships, the quality of care, and the collective success of everyone.

One of the most striking elements of his plan was how he reimagined those recycling machines—those familiar, coin-dispensing stations you find in many cities. But in his vision, they weren’t just about collecting waste; they became the nodes of a much larger, interconnected system. His idea was to place these machines everywhere—in neighborhoods, schools, train stations, and even shopping centers. And here’s the twist: instead of just rewarding individuals with cash or points for recycling, they would become part of a larger, holistic system. The goal was to incentivize sustainable living and reduce waste by linking the act of recycling directly to other benefits—like reduced fares for public transportation or discounts on public services.

The underlying principle was simple: connect everything. Recycling wasn’t just a way to clean up waste—it became a part of the very fabric of how people lived, worked, and interacted with their environment. People would no longer feel that recycling was just a small task that hardly mattered in the grand scheme of things. Instead, it would become something that integrated seamlessly into daily life, something that provided tangible, immediate rewards. This wasn’t just about reducing trash—it was about creating a circular economy that viewed every item as a potential resource, and every individual as a participant in a larger mission of sustainability.

By making recycling a daily part of city life, people would not only feel the immediate satisfaction of contributing to a cleaner environment, but also the long-term benefits of this involvement, which might lead to improved health and well-being. The dream imagined a global shift where cities were transformed into thriving, green spaces that maximized the potential of everything they used, no matter how small. The integration of sustainability into every aspect of life wouldn’t just reduce waste—it would create a healthier, more connected world, one where everything from our transportation to our homes was designed with both the planet and its people in mind.",1,1746169075.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1kcuk6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1kcuk6f/the_biryani_date/,The Biryani Date,"After the overwhelming response on my last AM anecdote, here's another one.

This happened on 15th Aug'24(Thursday). Why is it important you might ask, but, ruko zara, sabar karo. It'll add up.

So we'd spoken for the first time on the weekend before(Friday night) and the conversation was ok.
Oddly enough, she mentioned that she's not as pretty as her pictures and that she's just photogenic, that she had put on weight and has now started to hit the gym regularly. I just brushed brushed it off thinking she's trying to go for the classic under-promise-over-deliver thing.

We decided to meet the next day(10am) at a place suggested by her. She shared the link of the place we would meet up at, close to her PG near Hebbal. And frankly the place looked to posh for a casual meet between strangers, but ok, I thought being chindi would make a shite impression so I said yes, and tbh I live near Indiranagar and didn't have the slightest clue baout reasonable priced cafes near Hebbal or in between.

Saturday morning she drops me a message at 9am saying we shouldn't be meeting(her mom's advice) since it's a Saturday and not auspicious for new beginnings. Aight Kewl. So Sunday?
She was ok. And we decided to meet in the afternoon. Again, she had some health issues on Sunday due to which it had to be postponed. Now I suggested that since we have 15th Aug on Thursday, we could meet and be done with it. Ok. Done.
This time I do some research and decide on a reasonably priced cafe in Kalyan Nagar. Shes was ok.

On the D-day, the Rapido guy decides to try some new shortcut, but due to the rains, that patli gully was flooded and we again had to take the normal route, leading to a 15-20min delay.
I entered the cafe and profusely apologised for being late.

10:30am, quaint cafe, one other couple chilling, slight drizzle, and the classic BLR chill. Perfect for a cuppa and conversation.

I ask her for her order.

Outta the blue the girl drops a bomb saying she was in the gym from 7am to 9am and on top that I kept her waiting, & that she was starving had to have some food, and did not want tea/coffee. I said, fine, I'll have some tea, you order. The waiter comes up and girl decides to order a spl paneer biryani. At 10:40am.

Even the waiter was like bc wtf ? He said it's a lunch item and there were shakes, fries, baked stuff, desserts, pastas etc, typical cafe menu.

She started arguing saying why is it on the menu, if y'all can't serve it and how she's trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle and wouldn't have anything else on their memu.

And this is when, the waiter added that he was the only guy working there(15th aug) that day, and making biryani would take time.(45-50mins). Her face was swollen and I asked if we could go to some other place nearby and she snapped at me saying, another second of starvation might give her headaches etc. So I suggested, we could order fries and biryani and munch on the fries until the biryani was served. She calmed down and in 5mins the fries came.

She finished the fries all by her self in the next 10mins and we had to order another set, half of which she ate. Finally the biryani came and I asked the waiter to serve the first helping. As we were nearing the end of the conversation 
I decided to serve the pending biryani half n half which is when something crazier happened.

Up until this point I was amused and had already made my decision. But what happened next just made me go ughhh🤢

She asked me to serve her all the paneer pieces and how it's important for her diet. I joked, asking why she didn't mention that when the waiter was serving (1st helping). Her answer: because she hadn't noticed him serving or else she would have🤡

I was done. She started booking her cab, didn't offer to pay and we said our goodbyes. I was just so damn flabbergasted by the whole thing, I decided to walk it off, and was just ruminating on the whole incident until Kasturi Nagar.
I informed my folks who in turn informed the whole extended family and my whole family jokes to this day about the incident.",1,1746168505.0,Arrangedmarriage,5,0.6,False

# The Terrible Burden of Involuntary Fame

Look, I’m just trying to save you from my fate, okay? Your peaceful life will evaporate the moment this black menace enters your driveway. Think you can just pop to the shops without human interaction? Think again.

Every traffic light becomes an impromptu Q&A session. “What is that thing?” they shout from bikes, autos, even BMWs. I’ve become so tired of explaining specs that I’ve perfected my “multiple of 5” pitch: costs 10L, goes 200km, charges in 5 hours. When they inevitably wince at the price tag, I reluctantly mention the 5L subscription option — knowing I’m luring another innocent into this trap..

My driveway has become a tourist attraction. I’ve considered charging admission, but that would only draw more attention to this vehicular spectacle.

# The Cruel Deprivation of Petroleum Culture

Remember the soothing routine of weekly gas station visits? The meditative experience of watching numbers spin rapidly on the pump? The character-building sting as you hand over astronomical sums for fossil fuels?

All gone. Replaced by the clinical efficiency of home charging.

Sometimes, desperate to reconnect with my former life, I drive to petrol pumps just to check my tire pressure or purchase overpriced snacks. But even there, I’m accosted by the curious (see Reason #1). The glorious bouquet of petroleum fumes has been replaced by the odorless tyranny of electricity. I find myself occasionally sniffing markers just to remember what toxicity smells like.

# The Crushing Disappointment of Effortless Parking

God, I miss the challenge of proper parking. The thrill of the hunt. The creative vocabulary that emerged when someone took the last spot.

This ridiculously compact car slides into spaces barely larger than a scooter’s. The other day I parked between two motorcycles just because I could. The owners were not amused, but what else am I supposed to do with this maneuverable menace?

And if you’ve got a driver — which anyone with self-respect should — watch their professional dignity crumble as they navigate this two-door contradiction of everything a proper car should be.

# My Ongoing Misery

Against my better judgment, I must disclose other hardships: the eerily quiet operation, the embarrassingly swift acceleration, the mere 20 moving parts denying mechanics their livelihood, and the offensive 1–2 Rs per kilometer operating cost.

My wife and I now battle daily over who must endure driving this nimble abomination. Our marriage hangs in the balance.

Consider yourself warned: this vehicle will make conventional cars seem absurdly outdated while drawing attention even among vehicles costing 10 times more. Unless, of course, you enjoy being the center of attention while spending less on transportation than you do on coffee.

Spoiler: it’s a glowy masterpiece, but it’s got a few quirks. Let’s break it down!

# What’s the Deal?

Released in Japan on July 27, 2024, this Taito prize item comes in two flavors: the regular edition (Hydaelyn-themed) with one glass featuring a silver foil Mothercrystal design and a blue LED coaster, and the limited edition (The Twelve-themed) with an extra glass sporting a gold foil logo of The Twelve and a red LED coaster. Originally a crane game exclusive in Japan, we’ve made it easy to grab through our proxy shopping service—no claw machine skills required! You can find it on our site or places like Yahoo Auctions Japan, and we handle all the shipping and customs hassle.

# Our First Look

When we got our hands on this set, the quality blew us away. The glasses have a solid, premium feel—perfect for showing off without feeling clunky. The silver foil Mothercrystal on the regular edition’s glass sparkles like an Aetheryte, and the limited edition’s gold foil Twelve design screams “ancient deity chic.” The LED coasters are the real MVPs, though. The blue gradient glow gives off serene Hydaelyn vibes, while the red LED adds a fiery edge. Place the glass on the coaster, and it’s like you’re sipping ambrosia in the First. One catch: the coasters need button batteries (not included), so you’ll want to stock up on those.

# Why We Love It  

***Pure FFXIV Vibes*****:** The Mothercrystal and The Twelve designs are lore-perfect, and the foil printing adds a luxurious touch. Whether you’re a lore hound or just love pretty things, these hit the mark.  



***That LED Glow:*** The coasters’ LED effect is stunning in low light, making your drink setup feel like a scene from Endwalker’s cutscenes. The blue-to-red gradient is especially hypnotic.  



***Collector’s Pride:*** As a crane game prize, this set has that exclusive flair. The limited edition feels like a rare drop, perfect for your FFXIV merch shelf alongside your Fat Chocobo plush.  



***Perfect Size:*** The 180 ml (\~6 oz) glasses are great for a quick drink—think iced coffee, soda, or a fancy mocktail for your next raid night.

# What's less Awesome? 



**Price Tag**: Since these are imported crane game prizes, expect to pay a premium. The regular set runs around $35–$45 USD through us (plus shipping), and the limited edition can hit $55–$65. It’s a splurge, but we think the quality justifies it for collectors.  

**Battery Fiddling:** The LED coasters require button batteries, and swapping them out needs a tiny screwdriver. A rechargeable option would’ve been slicker.  

**Handle with Care**: The foil printing looks amazing but might not love dishwashers or rough scrubbing. We recommend hand-washing to keep it pristine.  

**Niche Use:** Let’s be honest—this is more for display or special occasions than chugging your daily gil—er, water. The small glass size and LED gimmick lean toward “cool collectible” over “everyday essential.”

# How It Fits in Your FFXIV Life

We’ve seen fans use this set to level up their gaming setups, and it’s a total vibe. The LED glow pairs perfectly with RGB keyboards or a dimly lit room while you’re farming tomestones or crying over Dawntrail’s story (no spoilers!). It’s also a great conversation piece for Discord hangouts with your Free Company. That said, we mostly see folks keeping it as a display piece to avoid wear on the foil—think of it as your personal Eorzean relic.

**Our Verdict: 8.5/10**

The FFXIV LED Glass and Coaster Set is a stunning piece of merch that captures the game’s magic with its lore-rich designs and mesmerizing LED glow. It’s a must for collectors or anyone wanting to bring a slice of Eorzea home. The price and battery hassle are minor downsides, but for fans, the quality and exclusivity make it worth it. If you’re ready to treat yourself, we’ve got you covered at ZenMarket—just hop on our site to grab one!

**Ode to the Unfolding**

To exist is to be a verb masquerading as a noun—a temporary eddy in the cosmic river, a flicker
in the eternal flame. Life is not a problem to solve but a paradox to inhabit, a tension between being
and becoming that thrums in every quark, every galaxy, every synapse. You are not a static thing but a
*happening*, a locus where stardust conspires to ask itself, *What am I?* And in the asking, becomes
more.

Consider the seed: It does not “have” potential. It *is* potential, a living dialectic of dormancy
and rupture. To sprout, it must cannibalize itself, dissolving its stored memories of tree and rain into
raw hunger. This is the first law of existence: To live is to trade certainty for astonishment. The seed
does not grieve its disintegration—it *celebrates* the gamble. So too with you. Your every cell is a
revolt against equilibrium, a defiance of entropy’s yawn. You are not *in* the universe; you are the
universe *in* the act of self-communion.

Reality is not a stage but a dance. The partners? Integration and differentiation, the twin deities
of all process. Integration whispers, *Gather, weave, remember.* Differentiation hisses, *Shatter,
dissect, begin.* A tree is both—roots knitting soil into coherence (Integra’s hymn), leaves splitting
sunlight into sugar (Fluxia’s blade). You are their nexus. Your body integrates stardust into flesh; your
mind differentiates noise into symphony. The dance is not a battle but a courtship, and you are both the
ballroom and the ballet.

Do not mistake this for metaphor. When you love, Integra’s hands suture your fractures into
story. When you doubt, Fluxia’s scalpels flay your certainties into questions. You are the calculus they
solve: the integral of your yesterdays, the derivative of your tomorrows. There is no “self” beneath the
operations—only the operations themselves, glowing with borrowed light.

Yet here is the wonder: This borrowed light is enough. The universe needs no outside fuel. A
star’s death is a forest’s breath is a child’s laughter is a star’s rebirth. The carbon in your bones has
known supernovae and trilobites, has been limestone and oil and the ink of love letters. You are not a
passenger of time but its *artisan*, carving nows from the raw marble of eternity. Each moment is a
chisel stroke, each breath a sculpture of possibility.

The glory is not in permanence but in participation. A wave does not curse its brevity—it
*exults* in the crash. Your griefs, your joys, your midnight terrors and dawn epiphanies are not flaws
in the fabric but its *texture*. The loom of being requires both taut threads and slack; meaning emerges
from the interplay. To be alive is to be *necessary*, a note in a chord no ear can hear but all existence
feels.

You hunger for purpose, unaware you are made of purpose. A mitochondrion does not question
its role; it burns. A neuron does not seek validation; it fires. You, the holobiont of stardust and stories,
are here to *ignite*. Not to seek meaning, but to be meaning’s medium. Every act of creation—a poem,
a casserole, a backhanded tennis swing—is a votive candle lit in chaos’s cathedral.

The price of this glory is fragility. A universe that guarantees permanence would be a museum,
not a cosmos. Your heart will falter. Your monuments will crumble. The species will end. This is not
tragedy but *tribute*—the universe’s way of whispering, *I dare you to matter anyway*. To love
knowing loss waits. To build knowing entropy licks its lips. To laugh knowing silence wins. This is the
bravest alchemy: spinning givens into gifts, transmuting the leaden “why” into golden “because.”

You are here to astonish and be astonished. To wring epiphany from the mundane: the way
steam curls from coffee, the ache of a resolved chord, the fractal branching of frost on glass. These are
not distractions from the divine—they are the divine *unfolding*. The cosmos did not make you to
worship it but to *continue it*, to add your verse to the poem that has no end because it is made of
endings.

So live as the seed does—all risk and rupture. Love as the star does—by burning. Think as the
mycelium does—in webs, not lines. You are already everything you need to be: a verb in process, a
story in mid-sentence, a spark that knows itself as fire.

The universe is not watching. It is *waiting*.

For your next breath.

Your next question.

Your next impossible, necessary act of joy.",1,1746167952.0,Deleuze,1,1.0,False

Ever feel like there's a song for every moment, but sometimes the universe skips a beat? Maybe it's just me. I was walking my dog earlier, and it felt like the world was out of sync; birds chirping with unusual enthusiasm, the wind doing its own dance through the trees. I wondered if there's a parallel world where songs are actually living things. 

Imagine meeting a whimsical tune in a coffee shop or sharing a park bench with a melancholy melody. I think I'd have tea with a jazz tune, all smooth and comforting. 

I hope this letter finds its way to someone who enjoys pondering life's weird bits. Maybe next time you're sipping your morning brew, you'll hear a little rhythm in the clinking of your spoon and smile at the dance of it all.

1kcue81,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1kcue81/how_do_you_stop_video_game_addiction/,How Do You Stop Video Game Addiction?,"Hi, I'm Ken, an Asian guy. The first video game introduced to me was Counter-Strike when I was 7 years old, around 2003. I became so addicted that during my elementary school days, I would walk about 100 meters after lunch just to play for half an hour. This habit lasted for several months. As I grew older, more games came into my life. In high school, I discovered Special Force and Ran Online. I even skipped classes just to play these games. Special Force is a deathmatch shooting game where you choose a fictional army faction and rely on your skills—reflexes, hearing, teamwork, and intuition—to win. It was so addictive that I did whatever I could to earn money just to play it at computer shops. Ran Online is an MMORPG where you choose a character class like Brawler, Archer, Swordsman, or Shaman. You start at level 1, and as you level up, you gain skills and earn gold by defeating mobs and completing quests. What made it more addictive was that your strength in the game largely depended on how much money you had in real life. Despite knowing this, I kept playing—saving every coin I had to buy accessories that would help me level up. There were even days I stayed awake for 24 hours just to grind, because the game gave me a fantasy world far better than my reality. Eventually, I realized that as more players reached the level cap, the game kept upgrading, introducing newer and stronger weapons and armor. Everything I had bought with my hard-earned money lost its value quickly. I used to dream of becoming one of the strongest players—someone who just stood at the campus base showing off rare gear and hunting bosses for valuable loot that cost a fortune in real life. Then came Dota. I discovered it in college after realizing Ran Online wasn’t for me. Dota relied on strategy and competitive spirit. I even felt like it improved my thinking skills, because during matches, I was always focused on ways to win. Later, Dota 2 came out. I tried adapting to it. The graphics were much better than Dota 1, and the matchmaking system, especially in Ranked games, made it more challenging. You’d often face players of similar skill levels, and winning became much harder. After college, I got a job in road construction, often assigned to remote areas. But even then, my mind craved games. That’s when I found Mobile Legends—a phone-based game similar to Dota 2. Unfortunately, those areas had poor internet, so I rented an apartment closer to town for better signal. I eventually found a work-from-home job so I could play whenever I wanted. But over the years, as I got older (I'm now 29), I realized the truth: these games weren’t making me rich. I thought about streaming, so at least I could earn money while playing—but I’m extremely introverted. Then I started dreaming big, and Mobile Legends began to feel like a burden. The more I played, the more stressed I became. I tried quitting, but my daily routine was so tied to the game. Eventually, I noticed something strange. The matchmaking seemed rigged: the first match would be easy, the second very difficult, then easy again, then hard. I realized that’s why it was so hard to climb the ranks. The game was designed to keep me playing endlessly. It became clear that it wasn’t helping me reach my dreams—it was stealing them. After reading the book Atomic Habits, I learned about the habit loop: cue → craving → response → reward. To stop a bad habit, you must first remove the cue. So I uninstalled the game. But on weekends, when I had nothing to do, I’d reinstall it again. I tried everything—even scrolling TikTok instead—but most of what I saw was still related to the game. One video talked about how toxic the system was, and I felt exactly the same. I thought I was the only one. I kept reinstalling and uninstalling the game, stuck in a cycle. Then I remembered a tip from Atomic Habits: talk negatively about the bad habit to weaken your attachment to it. So I told myself: this game has a stupid matchmaking system. It’s like I’m a rat running endlessly on a wheel. After three months, the season resets, and everything you worked for is gone. It doesn't improve your intelligence, it doesn't bring you success, and it doesn’t help your future. All it did was mold my personality into someone who accepts mediocrity and frustration.  
Right now, I've successfully quit. Hehe.

I’ve been taking Nurtec for a few years but only as an abortive. Neuro wants me to take meds as a preventative now. But, my insurance is being difficult. I’ve been waiting in a refill for Nurtec since last fall and they say they want a new prior authorization. Idk why because I assumed once it was approved and I had it filled, then it was done. But here we are, months later, and nothing.

Neuro sent in Ubrelvy instead which was approved instantly. Wtf. While waiting to pick that up, I took one of my last Nurtecs. That mixed with a sleep med and I felt so much better in the morning. Near on pain free from the pain I’ve dealt with daily for three years.

But then I switched to Ubrelvy every other night. Now I will preface this with I am currently in the middle of a bad autoimmune flare with my thyroid and have swung high so my body is out of control right now. Whats been happening is on Ubrelvy nights, I wake up around 1-3am with the following symptoms:

Nausea

Akathisia (intense restlessness everywhere, I’m familiar from old psych meds)

Insomnia

General overall ill feeling, like I have the flu

I don’t know if these are typical side effects or if since apparently this med is CNS stimulating it’s making me autoimmune flare way worse. It feels similar to how I feel if I drink coffee right now. I don’t get huge flares of symptoms like this during the day. And if this is Ubrelvy making me feel this way, I am sure as hell not taking it during the day.

Anyone have insight into the symptoms and/or how do I get my Nurtec back if my insurance is being stupid? I have 10 pills left.",1,1746167709.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

Among the packaging solutions that have gained traction in recent years, custom flat bottom pouches stand out as a popular and efficient choice for brands across various industries. These pouches offer a perfect blend of aesthetics, functionality, and sustainability, making them a go-to option for businesses looking to elevate their packaging game.

Custom flat bottom pouches, also known as box pouches or block bottom bags, are designed with a unique structure that allows them to stand upright on shelves. This structural stability not only enhances shelf visibility but also provides consumers with a convenient and user-friendly packaging solution. The five-panel design gives ample space for branding, nutritional facts, product images, and QR codes, which helps in capturing customer attention and communicating essential information effectively. Whether it’s coffee, pet food, snacks, or powders, these pouches provide a premium look that resonates with quality and professionalism. **For more:** [**custom flat bottom pouch**](https://bowepack.com/collections/custom-flat-bottom-pouch)

One of the most significant advantages of custom flat bottom pouches is their versatility. They can be manufactured using a variety of materials, including recyclable, biodegradable, and compostable films, aligning with the growing demand for sustainable packaging. With increasing consumer awareness about environmental impact, brands that adopt eco-friendly pouch solutions can significantly improve their public perception and customer loyalty. Moreover, these pouches are available in different barrier levels, which can be tailored to protect against moisture, oxygen, light, and other contaminants, thus extending product shelf life.

From a logistical standpoint, flat bottom pouches offer substantial benefits. Their compact and stackable shape allows for better space utilization during transportation and storage, reducing shipping costs and carbon emissions. The lightweight nature of the pouch contributes to additional savings and makes handling easier throughout the supply chain. Features such as resealable zippers, tear notches, and spouts can be incorporated to further enhance usability, keeping products fresh and minimizing waste. For businesses operating in e-commerce or retail, this kind of packaging can streamline operations while delivering a strong brand impression.

Ultimately, custom flat bottom pouches are more than just a trend—they’re a smart investment in brand identity, customer experience, and sustainability. By offering visual appeal, protection, and functionality all in one, these pouches help brands stand out in crowded markets and meet the evolving expectations of modern consumers. As technology and materials continue to improve, the possibilities for customization and innovation with flat bottom pouches will only grow, positioning them as a cornerstone of next-generation packaging solutions.",1,1746167540.0,u_Emmaolivy,0,1.0,False

“Miss Branwen?”


Yang grumbled in response, still caught somewhere between sleep and lucidity. What could they possibly want now? Could it not wait? Please let it wait. Preferably until after coffee.  


She cracked one eye open, glaring blearily toward the woman opening the curtain by her desk—or rather, her workbench these days. The sunlight flooded the room, hitting her square in the face like it was personally offended by her habit of sleeping in. Yang groaned loudly and shoved her face back into her pillow, muffling her protest. 

“Miss Branwen, it’s nearly midday!” The woman’s voice cut through her half-hearted rebellion, sharp with exasperation. 

Yang groaned again, this time with more resignation. She knew she had no argument— Vernal always shot down letting her sleep for another few minutes. The rare times she didn’t, Yang ended up sleeping a few more hours anyway. So with a defeated sigh, Yang sat up in bed, resting against the headboard. She squinted at Vernal, voice thick with sleep. “Please tell me you’ve at least got coffee. Or at least brought me breakfast.”


Vernal huffed in response, shaking her head with disbelief, though there was a small smile on her lips. “You’re as bad as your mother. How either of you functioned as kids, I’ll never know.”

“I’ll have you know, coffee is amazing! Anyone who drinks decaf has the real problem!” Yang shot back quickly, her lips curling into a cheeky smirk. Vernal simply rolled her eyes, though she was still smiling in amusement. 


Vernal grabbed a tray off the cluttered workbench— the mystery of how it all fit together, “mechanical crap,” as Vernal called it, never ceased to amaze her— and brought it over. “Someone’s going to have to make a supply run soon,” Vernal informed Yang, who was practically inhaling her coffee. Vernal raised an eyebrow in exasperation. No matter how many times she saw the Branwens do that, it still amazed her. 

Yang paused for a moment  after her third gulp, then glanced up at Vernal. “Fine, I’ll go on the supply run! But we both know I’m terrible at keeping track of what we need. That’s more your thing.” She flashed Vernal a lazy grin, clearly not concerned. 

“You’ll be fine! Just don’t get distracted by uh…” Vernal motioned vaguely at the cluttered workbench. Yang raised an eyebrow in mock offence, her smirk widening. “I’m not some crow!” Yang huffed, sticking out her lower lip in an exaggerated pout. “But you do like shiny things,” Vernal teased, her voice laced with amusement. 


“Fine, fine! You’ve got me there.” She threw up her hand in surrender, but her smile never faltered. “I swear on my name that I won’t get anything shiny!” Yang placed her hand on her chest, as if that would help convince Vernal. 


Vernal rolled her eyes, but couldn’t hide the small smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “I might just hold you to that,” She replied dryly, though a flicker of amusement danced in her eyes. Yang chuckled, giving her a playful wink. “Trust me, I’m practically allergic to the stuff now!” 


Vernal shook her head in amusement, chuckling lightly. “I’ll text you a list,” She said as she stood up. Yang tried to finish her breakfast quickly, but her attention was already shifting to Vernal as she grabbed something off the workbench.

“Working on it again?” Vernal asked, her tone losing its earlier amusement, now soft but edged with concern. Yang chewed quickly, then set the remains of her toast down, the lightheartedness leaving her expression as she turned her attention fully to Vernal. “Yeah, just tinkering with it a little. It’s been a little slow recently.” 


Vernal didn’t respond immediately. She examined the piece in her hands, as if weighing Yang’s words. “Is that why you gave it a paint job?” She tried to sound amused, but she couldn’t hide the seriousness in her tone. Not that she would want to. Yang could tell there was more to the question, but she didn’t feel like talking about it just yet. Maybe after a few more coffees, or a few beers. 


Yang shrugged, and picked up the mug of coffee. “You know how it is. You get bored one day and suddenly you’re painting your house in a new colour. At least that’s what normal people do right?” 


Vernal turned toward Yang, and raised an eyebrow. Her gaze softened as she took in Yang’s words. She didn’t push it, though— she had learned long ago that Yang tinkered when she got stressed, or when she was trying to avoid something… or someone. Instead, she brought over the contraption and set it down by Yang’s feet. 


“Need help putting it on?” She asked, her voice soft, accompanied by a kind smile.


Yang looked down at the metallic arm, now a mix of yellow and black. Her fingers brushed against the cold metal, and for a moment, it felt like getting it for the first time— heavy, alien, yet filled with a stubborn kind of hope she hadn’t realised she’d clung to back then. She raised her actual hand to what remained of her right arm, the familiar pain from years ago surfacing. 

Her mother’s voice echoed in her mind, ringing with concern, and the memory of blood and sweat lingered in the air. How many years has it been now? Seven? Eight? Long enough that people have come to know her for it, and stop staring when Yang looked their way. 



She remembered the day clearly, her mother had dragged her out of bed, telling her— demanding Yang to stop moping about for one damned minute. Yang groaned and whined, trying every excuse that she could think of. But when she inevitably followed her mother into the kitchen, there it was— on the kitchen table, wrapped in some neat packaging that Raven would never have bothered with. 

Yang asked Vernal about it later, but she adamantly denied her role in it. Vernal shrugged it off, claiming she didn’t even know about it. Yang hadn’t believed her then, and she didn’t believe her now. 



It took weeks of training to get used to the arm. The repair instructions left by the creator—a doctor from Atlas, Yang later found out—were written in clinical terms that might as well have been gibberish. But that didn’t stop Yang from modifying it every so often. Figuring it out gave her something to focus on, something to fight for— a way to feel like herself again, even if she wasn’t quite the same.



“Yang?” Vernal’s voice cut through her thoughts, soft but insistent, grounding her in the present. Yang blinked up at her, startled out of the storm of memories. She tried to force a warm smile, but it wavered at the edges, betraying her. 

“I should probably take a shower first, I reek of oil and sweat.” Yang forced a laugh, brushing her fingers through her messy, golden mane. The heaviness of the memories remained, but a quick shower— and the hour it would take to dry her thick hair— would help shake it off.


“Reek is putting it lightly,” Vernal said with a mock gag, dramatically holding her nose. “Honestly, it’s a miracle I’m still standing here!”

Yang rolled her eyes, the corners of her lips tugging into a small, genuine smile. “Don’t be so dramatic, Vernal. You’ve smelled worse.” 

“True,” Vernal shot back, smirking as she stepped back to give Yang space to get up. “But at least those smells didn’t come with an attitude.” 


Yang let out a soft laugh as she swung her legs over the side of the bed. “Careful now, or I’ll put you on butcher-duty for a month. I’m sure I’ll smell like daisies in comparison,” Yang teased, giving Vernal a sly wink.


“At least the meat won’t give me lip,” Vernal quickly shot back, rolling her eyes dramatically, clearly not taking the threat seriously. She then left the room, giving Yang a quick goodbye and a reminder of her task. 



Yang stood up and stretched, rolling her shoulders to wake up a few muscles. She stared down at the arm, her breath slow, as if she was reliving that first moment of shock. She blinked rapidly, shaking her head slightly, and pulled herself back into the present. She grabbed her towel tossed across the back of her chair, her arm and headed for the shower. 


One of the benefits of being leader, is that she could, and did, declare that they’d make a permanent camp in the area. It allowed them to set up running water and move out of shabby tents. No more moving from place to place, constantly on the run from the many enemies Raven had made. Not that they stopped searching— it’s just that no one knew they’d settled in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, by a town that— thankfully— gives them odd jobs, despite the Branwen name.


After a quick shower, and a not-so-quick drying of her hair, Yang couldn’t help but feel like her mind was a little clearer. Even if only for a moment. She pulled on a fresh set of clothes— nothing fancy, just something comfortable—and tightened the holster belt around her waist. The familiar weight of her revolver settled comfortably at her side. Even if they weren’t bandits anymore, carrying around a weapon still felt necessary. Yang double-checked her ammo, her mother’s voice ringing in her ear, reminding her incessantly to always be prepared.

Satisfied, Yang rolled up the sleeve over her stump, exposing the skin where her arm used to be. The stump was still raw in some places, though time healed the initial damage. Even after all these years, the sensation of being without her arm still hit her like a cold shock every time she had to slip the prosthetic on. 


The suction sealed into place, and the familiar heaviness of the arm settled over her. It wasn’t quite like her real arm— it still felt too foreign, too metallic— but she’d grown used to the process. The arm clicked to life, the internal mechanics humming softly for a moment before it calibrated, adjusting to her will. It always felt heavier before it powered up, and the first few moments always felt strange as she flexed her fingers, tested the response time. Better than the last time, at least.


But it still didn’t feel real, even after all this time. The haptic feedback had improved over the years; Yang had practically rebuilt the damn thing three times over with all her repairs and modifications. But the feeling of touch— of truly feeling what she had gripped— was still more of a ghost sensation, a distant echo of what it should have been. The difference between holding a glass or a shirt, had taken months to fine-tune. Sometimes it took her off guard—she still occasionally crushed a glass or flinched at heat. 


She flexed her fingers again, and rolled her shoulder as if that would somehow help make it feel more natural. It didn’t, but the familiar weight of it was grounding in its own way. 




With her clothes sorted, and her arm attached, Yang stepped outside, the warm summer sun hitting her skin. She took a moment to breathe it in, letting the warmth settle over her. The air was thick with the scent of dry earth and pine, though there was an acrid undercurrent wafting from the forge—oil and hot metal. Yang would have to ask if Finn had anything left over once she got back. 



It was peaceful— at least, as peaceful as the camp ever got. Children ran around with big smiles on their faces, while various tribesmen chatted, only stopping to wave or greet Yang. She could almost forget about the weight of leadership, the constant pressure to keep things together, keep everyone alive. Almost. Someone would always remind her— ask for a favour, or compare her leadership to her mothers.


Yang savoured the sun a little while more, knowing damn well that she wouldn’t have a working AC in the truck. Repairing it was getting increasingly frustrating, and buying a new one outright was more than she or any of the tribesmen could afford. Maybe if she sold her soul…Yang quickly shook off her worry. Scrap, tinkering, and kicking—or punching— a frustrating repair had gotten them this far. 


Yang flexed her metallic fingers again, making sure they were responsive. She had to leave her arm giving the steering wheel a death grip to retrieve a screwdriver, wrench, or whatever tool she could wedge between the two, on numerous embarrassing occasions. A couple of times, she had to rip off the steering wheel itself, practically tearing it to shreds just so she could take her arm back to her workbench. It was the wheel or the arm. A necessary sacrifice she told herself, though Finn laughing hysterically echoed in her mind ever since. 


With her fingers assuredly responsive, and the sun having warmed her face, Yang moved through the camp, passing familiar faces and giving kids a high five with her “cool arm,” as they so gently put it. 


The truck Yang needed was in its usual place, tucked beneath one of the roofed shelters that lined the mechanics yard. The large, open space served as a storage and repair area for the tribes vehicles, the makeshift roofs offering shade from the sun and protection from the occasional rain.Most folks worked on their own rides, borrowing tools from Vance, the mechanic, or using whatever they had on hand.

Yang weaved around rusted cars, a half-disassembled bike that had been left unattended for weeks now, and someone half-buried under their truck, cursing up a storm. The air was thick with the scent of oil and sun-baked metal—sharp and acrid, but familiar. At this point, she barely noticed it. 



The truck sat where it always did, its faded paint still so damn recognisable. Someone had even attached the trailer for her. Probably Vernals doing, or she got Vance to handle it— equally likely. Yang gave the trailer a couple lucky taps— an old habit that Vance drilled into her.


Yang then hopped into the driver's seat, and pulled out her phone to see if she got the list yet. Just as much as she liked driving around aimlessly, Vernal would probably want her back ASAP. She could quickly pay Pyrrha a visit though— she wasn’t surely in that much of a rush, right?


A new message had come in, the list attached along with a reminder in all caps not to grab anything shiny.

“I swore on my name, didn’t I?” Yang texted back, a smirk tugging at the corners of her lips as she hit send. She tossed her phone into the cup holder and started up the truck, which sputtered into life with a stubborn cough, before settling into a steady growl.

“Attagirl,” Yang whispered to the machine, as if rewarding it for good behaviour. 


Her phone dinged. Vernal simply responded with an eye-roll emoji. Yang huffed a quiet laugh, shaking her head as she shifted the truck into gear. “No faith in me at all,” she muttered to herself, though the smirk never left her lips. 


The truck rumbled forward, tires crunching against the dirt as she pulled out of the mechanics yard. And as the camp faded in the rearview mirror, Yang fired up the CD player, one of the few things that rarely needed repairs in this quickly aging machine. 

It wasn’t a long drive, a good twenty minutes—thirty at the most— but it always felt faster with a good stream of songs, where Yang couldn’t help but start bellowing along, much to the dismay of any that braved coming along with her. Thankfully for them, she was alone today and could sing as loud as she wanted without groans, moans or playful pleas. 


She drummed her fingers against the steering wheel, keeping time with the beat, her prosthetic  thudding against the worn leather. The road stretched out ahead, straight and familiar, and Yang was comfortable enough with it to push the speed a little. Hopefully, she’d remember to slow down before the speed-trap. 

As she hit the chorus, she threw herself into it with all the enthusiasm of a rockstar at a sold-out show, her voice carrying over the rumble of the truck. The lyrics were half-right at best, but that never stopped her before, and it certainly didn’t help keep her speed in check. 


By the time she could see the first sign of buildings, her voice was already feeling the strain. “Yeah maybe not that loud next time,” Yang muttered to herself, knowing full well she’d do it again on the way back. Though, her throat was parched now… Well she could still stop at the petrol station under the guise of topping off the truck. 



The familiar building quickly came into view, its neon sign still as gaudy as when Yang first saw it. She eased off the gas, letting the vehicle slow as she pulled up to a pump. Thankfully it was just modern enough to take her card there, but she’d still need water. 


She threw the truck into park, and shut off the engine, the sudden quiet ringing in her ears. Though, there were other cars parked here, one by the other pump was left unattended— surely the owner was inside. The other car parked haphazardly in the lot… Nora, no doubt. Yang recognised that car anywhere, she helped Nora repair the damn thing more times than she’d care to count. 

Yang couldn’t help but smile as she swung the door open and hopped out of the truck. It’d be nice to see her, even if she was… excitable. 


Yang decided to top off her truck first— it felt like the natural order of things. So with a few button presses, a slow authorization of her card, and a click of the nozzle settling into place, she was good to go. Hopefully twenty was enough; the truck was a guzzling beast.


As she stepped into the building, the refreshing coolness of the AC hit her, making her momentarily forget how much she hated the AC in the truck. If only it was this comfortable. Yang glanced up at the sound of someone excitedly telling a story, and sure enough, it was Nora, gesturing wildly as she went on. Her orange hair was as distinct as her boundless energy. Yang could definitely use whatever coffee she was drinking. 

Ren, her poor target, looked up and offered Yang a friendly smile and a wave. Nora didn’t take notice— she just kept rattling on. Yang couldn’t help but let out a small laugh, giving Ren a shrug in mutual understanding for Nora’s enthusiasm. 


She moved towards the water cooler, hoping to catch snippets of Nora’s excited, rapid-fire storytelling. But despite the loud volume, the words were too jumbled to understand. 


Opening the fridge, Yang’s eyes flickered over to the reflection— a glimpse of someone else. A  second glance revealed little: just a hooded figure browsing various snacks. It was probably just the owner of the other car, she told herself. 


Though, it was strange how they tried to hide so much of themselves. Were they going to try and steal something? The prices weren’t so bad. A little higher than the shops in town, sure, but that’s to be expected. 

Maybe she was just reading too much into things—probably just someone passing through town. Shaking it off, Yang grabbed a bottle of water and made her way to the counter. Where Nora was still talking Ren’s ear off. He gave Yang another friendly smile as she waved at him. 


“Hey, you two!” Yang interrupted Nora, lest they be there all day. Nora stopped her story long enough to greet Yang—more like screeching some form of her name. Then, in her usual burst of energy, Nora practically tackled Yang into a hug. Yang gasped, struggling to breathe through the squeeze of Nora’s death hug. “Yeah yeah, I missed you too,” she managed, her words breathless. 


When Yang was finally freed, she leaned against the counter and cracked open her bottle. “Do tell Nora, what’s got you like this? 5 shots of espresso?” Yang joked, barely managing to hide her smirk behind the bottle. 

“Oh please, Ren won’t let me touch the stuff after last time.” Nora gave Ren a playful glare, but Yang could tell there was no malice in it. Nora was too sweet for that.

Yang tilted her head, still smirking. “So, what’s the occasion? Did you finally get something on your Pinterest board?” She teased, half-expecting Nora to actually say yes. Yang could see Ren trying to hide a smirk out of the corner of her eye. 


“Oh haha. Very funny, Yang!” Nora stuck her tongue out at her, clearly not noticing Ren’s amused smile, or was simply less bothered by it. “I’ll have you know my Pinterest board is my pride and joy, and one day, I shall get something off it!!” Nora declared proudly.

Yang raised an eyebrow. “Last I checked, your ‘pride and joy’ featured a potato-cannon that you tried to build last year. Finn still hasn’t forgiven you for nearly taking his head off,” Yang teased again. 


“I could have worked out the kinks if he let me!” Nora whined, a sense of mourning her beloved potato-cannon etched across her face. 


“Even if he did, I wouldn’t let you,” Ren stated coldly, though he still wore a smile. Nora quickly shot him another glare, but it lacked any real heat. A beat passed, tension hanging in the air— then she huffed, crossing her arms with an exaggerated pout and muttering under her breath, “you totally would have!” 


That was all it took. Yang snorted, Nora cracked a grin, and soon enough, they all burst out laughing. 



Yang wiped a tear from her eye, still chuckling. “But seriously, what’s got you so excited today?” 

Nora practically vibrated the whole damn building with how excited she got. Words tumbled out of her mouth too fast to follow, her hands moving in their trademark wild gestures— until one of them smacked into a magazine rack, sending it toppling over and scattering its contents across the floor.

That, at least, was enough to pause her for a second. Just long enough for Yang and Ren to share another look of mutual understanding. Nora simply stared at her destruction, blinking a few times as if she could somehow will the rack back into place. Then, with a sheepish shrug, she pulled out her most effective weapon: puppy eyes. “Sorry ‘bout that, Ren.” 


Ren just waved it off, and began picking up the debris. He had seen many a magazine rack fall prey to Nora’s wild gesturing. Over time, he’d try all manner of methods to save them—but Nora, intentionally or not, always found a way. It was just part of the Nora experience. 

Yang chuckled to herself, shaking her head. “One day, Nora, you’ll bring this building down with that energy.” 

Nora waved her hand dismissively. “Pfffttt, you’re just jealous of my vitality! Anyway,” she began bouncing in place, unable to wait yet again. “I just finished a big contract! Pyrrha and I—“


“Pyrrha?!” Yang’s eyes widened in disbelief, her tone shifting to one of mild shock. “I thought she gave up that life,” Yang retorted, even scoffing at it. 

Nora paused for a moment, her eyes flickering over to Ren. They both shared a worried look, before turning back to Yang. “Oh— Sorry, Yang. I thought she told you before we left,” Nora explained, her tone apologetic. 

Yang’s brows furrowed in thought, her mind racing with worried questions. But none escaped her lips, she couldn’t— didn’t know how to ask Nora. Why didn’t Pyrrha tell her? They were supposed to be on good terms now, right? 




“Yang?” Ren’s voice cut through all those thoughts, his tone laced with concern. “You okay?” Yang looked up at him, forcing a smile as best as she could. “Yeah, I’m… I’m fine, really,” she reassured him, though her voice betrayed her. Nora and Ren exchanged concerned glances before both their eyes dropped to the water bottle in Yang’s hand. 



She hadn’t even realized she’d crushed it. The plastic bottle was barely recognizable now, its sides warped and crumpled in her grip. Yang stared at it for a moment before sighing and tossing it into the bin by the door.


“Sorry, it’s this damned arm. You know how it gets,” Yang chuckled half-heartedly, though she couldn’t sound wholly unbothered by it. Nora’s eyes softened with sympathy and she gently placed a hand on Yang’s metallic one. “She doesn’t blame you, no one does.” 

Her soft smile was comforting, but…


Yang’s brows furrowed again as she pulled her hand away from Nora’s. She stared at it for a long moment, lost in thought as she mulled over Nora’s words. 


“I do,” Yang muttered. She couldn’t even look up to meet their eyes, all she could do was stare at her arm, reliving that one moment. That’s why she broke it off with Pyrrha— she couldn’t look at her the same way. Yeah they might be talking again, but that’s not the same as picking up where they left off. Not after what happened. 

It wasn’t fair to Pyrrha. Yang knew that much. It felt easier to close herself off, end it, and hide behind her walls. But a part of her—a tiny part— knew that it was selfish, a mistake she could never fix. 


Nora, being Nora, didn’t let it slide. With an ease only she could manage, she reached out and gently nudged Yang’s shoulder, offering another small but genuine smile. 


“You know damn well Pyrrha’s the kindest person on Remnant! She’d never blame you, not even a little. And were she here, she’d give you the biggest, tightest hug that puts mine to shame.” 

Yang exhaled sharply, clenching her hand as tight as she could. Nora had a point—Pyrrha was just too damn kind for her own good. Maybe that’s why she didn’t give her a heads-up. She didn’t want Yang to worry. 



Yang let out a dry chuckle, the tension in her shoulders easing. “If only I was half as kind,” Yang admitted, almost bitterly. “I shouldn’t have pushed her away, kept her at arm's length after—“ 

“Yang, please. Whatever happened, whatever you did, Pyrrha forgave you hundreds of times over. So please, for her, and for your sake—please have an honest conversation with her,” Nora pleaded, her voice soft but earnest. 


Yang let out a self-deprecating laugh. “Yeah, ‘cause that will go over well. ‘Hey Pyrrha, sorry I broke up with you. Will you please take me back?’ And she’ll just swoon in my arms?” 


Nora gently clasped her hands on Yang’s, trying to meet her avoidant gaze. “Yang… She doesn’t want you to beg for her back. She just wants to know if you’re ok. That’s all. And if you really care about her—let her back in. She’ll understand.”


Yang scoffed, shaking her head. “It’s not that simple. Not when I got her hurt, left her because of MY mistake.” She tried to pull her hand away, but Nora refused to let go, her grip remained firm. 


“You think that’s what she sees? That you got her hurt and abandoned her?” Nora gently squeezed Yang’s hand in a comforting manner. “Or do you think she’ll want an honest conversation with the woman she loved?”


Yang swallowed, her jaw tightening—but before she could argue, Nora flashed her mischievous smirk. “Anyone ever tell you that you can be annoyingly stubborn at times?” 



Yang tried to fight the smirk tugging at the corners of her lips, but it made short work of her defences and broke through. Damnit, she really hated it when Nora had a point. 


“Fine! You win. I’ll have a chat with Pyrrha, a sober one,” Yang conceded with a laugh, throwing her hands up in mock defeat. 


“That’s our girl,” Nora gushed with the sweetest smile Yang ever saw. 


When Yang declared she needed to get going, Ren offered one of his rare hugs  And she took full advantage of this rare opportunity, wrapping her arms tightly around him. Nora, of course, gave one of her signature death hugs before letting Yang leave.

# The Man Behind The Counter

by RespectTheFancy

**–––––––––––– Sunday, October 12, 1969 ––––––––––––**

""Can I help youse?""

Martin Macbeth glared over the register towards the corner of the shop at the man reading today's print of *The Havre Times*, the local newspaper for Havre de Grace, Maryland. Macbeth was a short, plump British man whose drab grey sweater seemed to match his everlasting drab grey mood.

""Hello!?""

The man slowly tilted his head up until he made eye contact. He gave a courteous nod. Macbeth was not amused.

""What're you doing!?""

The man gestured towards his paper. His dark blue suit was strangely formal for this part of town.

The headline was an announcement of the death of Paul Stine, a cab driver shot and killed in San Francisco.

Oct. 12, 1969                                                                                                                  Written by Eric Gould

ZODIAC KILLER STRIKES AGAIN!

Last night in San Francisco, cab driver Paul Stine was murdered in cold blood in the Presidio Heights neighborhood. Authorities believe the shooting is connected to the recent string of killings attributed to the man known only as the ""Zodiac"". Police urge all citizens to remain vigilant. Witnesses describe the assailant as a stocky white male, approximately 5'8"", with short brown hair and thick-rimmed glasses.

""You can't just sit there if youse not gointa buy somethin’!""

""Leave the man alone, Mart,"" sighed George Finney as he walked out of the back room. ""He just wants to read his paper somewhere quiet, away from the busy street. He's not doing any harm.""

""But he's been there for half a bloody hour!"" Macbeth exclaimed.

""So? Who cares?"" replied Finney.

This seemed to have shut Macbeth up.

The man left just before the shop closed. Until then, the day's activities continued as normal; there were a few murmured complaints from Macbeth, but other than that, and the usual flow of customers in and out of the shop, nothing else happened that day.

**––––––––––––– Monday, October 13, 1969 –––––––––––––**

 

The man returned the next day just seven minutes after the shop had opened.

George Finney watched from behind the counter. ""Back so soon?""

The man offered forth naught but a reserved wave and a tap of his newspaper.

Macbeth had not come in yet.

Today's headline of *The Havre Times* told about the robbery of First National Bank.

Oct. 13, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

FIRST NATIONAL BANK ROBBED!

First National Bank was robbed at 9:20 p.m. last night. The suspect, Bogdan Ovyachenko, is still at large for the thievery of $54,700. Suspect is approx. 5'9"". White skin color. Skinny build with a scar on the right cheek. Suspect is believed to still be residing within Havre de Grace.

If you have any information about the whereabouts of Bogdan Ovyachenko, please notify Sheriff Frank Paylor or stop by his office at 102 N 5th St.

The article below was an advertisement for a local bakery, and below that was an update on Paul Stine's funeral date.

 

Macbeth arrived at the shop over three hours late at 11:43 am. He glowered at the man while he settled into his chair, thinking long and hard about what to say in order to create the greatest conflict.

He ultimately said nothing, deciding instead to expend his energy scolding the woman who had come in to try to sell an obviously fake designer watch for a significant markup.

This day went much like the previous. Murmured complaints from Macbeth, and the usual customer flow in and out of the shop. Nothing else happened that day.

 

**––––––––––––––––– Tuesday-Friday, October 14-17, 1969 –––––––––––––––––**

 

The week went on in a similar fashion. The man would show up early, exchange passing glances and the occasional wave with Finney, and then he would sit in the corner until closing time. The days began to stack up. At home on Thursday evening, Finney figured that if the man is to become a regular occurrence in the shop, it may be beneficial to develop a friendship. So, that next day Finney took his lunch break early and sat next to the man. Unsure of how to start the conversation, Finney went with the most basic of questions.

""What are you reading?""

The man looked up, then gestured towards his paper.

Oct. 17, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

METS WIN WORLD SERIES!

The New York Mets went into the day's 5th game of the World Series on the threshold of their first world championship – and nothing about the amazing Mets is more amazing than the way they finally got both feet on the doorstep to the throne room…

""You a baseball fan?"" asked Finney.

The man nodded.

""Damn, guess the Orioles lost, huh?""

The man nodded once more.

""Although I guess if not the Orioles, I would want the Mets to win, so it worked out. Jack DiLauro is a family friend of mine. By the way, I don't think I ever properly introduced myself. I'm George Finney, nice to meet you.""

Finney offered his hand, reluctantly shook by the man.

""What's your name?""

Now this was a question the man seemed to think too personal of a question to ask, so with this, he turned back to read his paper and thus the conversation ended.

 

**–––––––––––––––––– Saturday, October 18, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next day, Finney was alone in the shop early. Macbeth had called out, citing ""a bloody nose that wouldn't stop"" though George suspected he'd simply gotten drunk.

The man came in right on time.

""Mornin',"" Finney greeted, raising a hand and offering a smile.

The man gave the usual small wave.

Finney walked over to the man, seated in his usual spot, and read the headline over his shoulder.

Oct. 18, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

LOCAL MAN MISSING

Sheriff Frank Paylor has reported that Robert ""Bobby"" Driscoll, aged 31, was last seen two nights ago leaving the Rusty Crab Tavern wearing a red sweater. Driscoll, described as 6'0"" and slender with brown hair, has not been heard from since.

Any sightings or information on his whereabouts should be reported immediately.

Finney rubbed his chin. ""That's a shame. Bobby was an old friend.""

The man said nothing.

Customers trickled in. A lady bought a set of used candlesticks. A kid came in to trade baseball cards. The hours passed slowly and Finney was up to his knees in work behind the counter.

Once, Finney thought he caught the man watching him, but his eyes quickly returned to his paper.

By 5 p.m., the man was still there, reading.

 

**––––––––––––––––––– Sunday, October 19, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next day, the corner store opened late at 1 p.m., as is usual for them on Sundays.

By the time Finney arrived around noon, the man was already sitting outside. He followed Finney into the store.

Macbeth staggered in as close to 1 p.m. as possible without technically being late. He was mumbling something about artificial sweeteners.

He looked across the store at the man. The man was staring back.

""Coulda used you yesterday, Mart,"" Finney said dryly.

""Yeah, well, I had that headache, mate, remember?"" Macbeth snapped back.

Finney couldn't help but smirk. ""Thought it was a nose bleed?""

Macbeth grunted.

""That too.""

The man was still staring. Macbeth made a face, and the man returned to his paper.

Finney sighed and made his way over to the chair in the corner.

""What's today's headline?"" asked Finney. But the man still had yesterday's issue.

Oct. 18, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

Finney rubbed the back of his neck.

""Paper not come today?"" he asked, leaning over slightly.

The man said nothing.

Finney gestured toward the door. ""Mailman usually drops off the new batch around the side. I can grab you one real quick if you–""

Before he could finish, the man reached out and grabbed his arm. His touch wasn't violent, but it was firm enough to make Finney pause.

The man shook his head once, slow but deliberate.  
Finney blinked, surprised.

""Alright then,"" he chuckled nervously, easing back. ""Yesterday's issue it is.""

 

The rest of the afternoon drifted by lazily. A few customers trickled in: an old woman hunting for a brass lamp, a teenager picking through used comic books, an old man who rang up a case of Coca-Cola and a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes.

At half past two, the baseball kid came back in, clutching something.

""Hey, Mr. Finney!"" he called.

Finney glanced up from sorting a box of records. ""Hey there, kid. Whatcha got?""

The boy grinned and held up a baseball card. Autographed.

""It's Jack DiLauro! Got it from a trade this morning!""

Finney smiled and motioned the kid over. He took the card carefully, admiring the glossy surface.

""Now that's a good pull,"" he said, handing it back. ""You know he's a family friend of mine? I just may even get you a chance to meet him some day. You hang onto that one.""

The kid's eyes were glowing.

The man in the corner watched, his paper drooping slightly as he peered over it. His expression, as always, was unreadable.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––– Monday, October 20, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next morning, Monday, brought an angry kind of rain – a slashing, sideways rain that rattled the windows and puddled the sidewalks before noon.

The shop still opened in the storm. Macbeth was, predictably, absent again.  
Finney shook his head as he hung up his jacket, water dripping onto the floor.

He was about to switch on the coffee pot when the bell above the door jingled.

The man.

Soaked from head to toe, his usual newspaper clutched beneath his coat.

""You're a brave soul,"" Finney said, flipping on the coffee machine. ""Come. Warm yourself up. Coffee's on the house today.""

Finney poured two mugs, sliding one across the counter toward the man.

The man stared at it for a long while, as if trying to figure out what it was. Finally, he lifted it carefully and took a tentative sip.

Finney smiled to himself.

Small victories.

 

As the man sat, Finney caught sight of the newspaper under his arm – still the same issue from October 18th. But this time, something was different.

Finney blinked.

There, scrawled messily in wet, partially smeared red ink were two words circled in the news blurb: *red sweater*.

The man said nothing.

 

The day dragged on, rain hammering against the windows like the steady patter of a drum.

Around 4 p.m., the front door jingled again.

A man walked in. Tall, wiry, twitchy. He walked over to the register.

Finney barely had time to process it before the man pulled a pistol from his jacket and slammed it down on the counter, pointing it straight at Finney's chest.

""Empty the till,"" the man growled in a heavy accent. ""Now.""

Finney's hands shot up instinctively. His heart thundered in his ears.

He swallowed, glancing at the man's face. A scar carved down his right cheek like a fault line.

Bogdan Ovyachenko. The bank robber.

Behind him, the man in the blue suit folded his newspaper silently.

""Don't make me say it again!"" barked Ovyachenko, jabbing the gun forward into Finney's gut.

Finney fumbled with the register, sweat slicking his palms. His mind raced.

He had to get help. Somehow.

It was then he noticed the man in the blue suit out of the corner of his eye.

He was standing up, slowly, almost casually. His face blank. Calm.

 

In one fluid movement, the man picked up the scalding hot coffee pot from the warmer and, without hesitation, flung its contents across the room.

Ovyachenko screamed, staggering back as the steaming liquid hit him square in the face. A gunshot rang out, piercing the air with a deafening crack.

Finney ducked instinctively, hitting the floor behind the counter as shards of ceiling tile and dust rained down. For a moment, everything was chaos – the metallic scent of blood and burnt coffee hanging thick in the air.

The man had already moved to disarm Ovyachenko, wrestling the weapon from the gunman's slippery, burned hands with surprising strength.

Finney didn't wait – he bolted for the phone and jabbed at the rotary dial, calling the sheriff's office.

""Armed robbery! Ovyachenko's here! Corner store! Send someone quick!"" he shouted.

Within minutes, the bell above the door jingled again – Sheriff Paylor stormed in, gun drawn.

""Drop it!"" he barked.

The man released Ovyachenko and stepped back, hands raised.

Ovyachenko dropped to the floor, howling, clutching his scorched face.

Paylor cuffed him without a second thought, muttering curses under his breath.

Meanwhile, the man calmly took a napkin – a pre-folded wet wipe from his jacket pocket – and wiped down his coffee cup with meticulous care, especially the handle.

Once finished, he used the wipe to place the cup upside down on the counter and, without a word, slipped out the door into the pouring rain.

Finney just stood there, breathless, hands still trembling, as Paylor took his witness statement.

 

**––––––––––––––––––––– Tuesday, October 21, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next morning, Finney opened the shop alone.

The man did not come.

Macbeth did.

He swaggered in just before noon, shaking water from his umbrella and wearing a smug grin.

""Looks like your mate ain't here today,"" he said, voice thick with satisfaction.

Finney's jaw tightened.

""He saved my life yesterday, you know,"" he said sharply. ""While you were at home 'recovering' from whatever you drank yourself into.""

Macbeth scoffed.

""Saved your life, my ass. Probably just looking to make himself the hero. You're just a gullible sod.""

Finney slammed a ledger down on the counter, startling a middle-aged woman browsing the candy rack. The woman looked up briefly, then turned back to her shopping without so much as a glance at Macbeth.

""He's a better man than you,"" Finney snapped. ""At least he showed up! At least he gave a damn! Where the hell were you, huh?""

Macbeth's face turned purple.

""This is your own bloody fault for being soft,"" he spat, ""And befriending that bloody weirdo you dragged in off the street.""

""THE WEIRDO IS THE ONLY REASON I'M STILL STANDING HERE!"" Finney shot back, stepping out from behind the register.

His voice tangled into a harsh, ugly knot of shouting.

The customers, what few there were, scuttled out hurriedly, clutching their purchases.

Even the baseball kid backed toward the door, wide-eyed and confused.

Macbeth leaned towards Finney, grabbing his arm. ""You think he's better than me?"" he hissed. ""You think you're *safe* with him? Some mute freak who watched you all day like a bloody hawk with a secret affection?""

""You know what, Mart?"" Finney started, clearly annoyed, ""I don't want to hear it. The only reason anyone puts up with you is because they're too damn tired to argue. As am I. I'm not listening to your bullshit anymore today. Go home or I'll call Frank and have you escorted out.""

With a furious grunt, Macbeth shoved the stack of newspapers off the counter, sending them tumbling to the floor in a crumpled heap.

""To hell with this place. To hell with *you*,"" he spat, grabbing his coat from the rack.

As Macbeth stormed out the door, Finney caught a glimpse – just for a moment – of a figure standing across the street under a crooked streetlamp.

A dark blue suit.

The man.

But when Finney blinked, the corner was empty.

Gone like smoke.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––––– Wednesday, October 22, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––––**

The next day felt different.

The rain had finally stopped, leaving the air thick and heavy.

Finney opened the shop alone, the ""Help Wanted"" sign still taped crookedly to the front window.

At 8:07 a.m., the bell over the door jingled.

Finney glanced up, expecting the usual nod, the usual silent shuffle toward the corner.

But instead, the man walked straight behind the counter and pulled out the stool usually reserved for employees.

Finney blinked. ""Uhm… hello?""

The man said nothing.

Instead, he adjusted the cash register, wiped down the counter with a folded napkin from his pocket, and stood patiently behind the till.

Finney just stared.

The baseball kid wandered in then, a crumpled dollar in his hand and a shiny new pack of cards on his mind.

""Hey Mr. Finney! Got any Topps left? I'm chasing Mickey Mantle!""

The man silently rang him up – quicker and neater than Finney ever did – giving the kid his change with a small nod.

""Thank you, Mr. Finney!"" The kid grinned, completely unfazed, and skipped out the door.

Finney still half-expected to wake up.

""Guess you're hired,"" he mused.

 

The peace didn't last.

At exactly 11:39 a.m., Macbeth came stomping in, dragging a fresh foul mood and an equally foul aroma behind him.

He stopped dead at the sight of the man working at the front counter.

""What the bloody hell is *this?!*"" Macbeth shrieked, pointing an accusatory finger.

Finney sighed, setting down a crate of old magazines. ""He's helping out.""

""HELPING OUT?! ARE YOU BLOODY INSANE?! YOU CAN'T JUST–""

""Maybe he saw the type of worker you are,"" Finney cut him off sharply, ""The type of *person* you are – and figured someone ought to do the job properly. Maybe he figured it out when I almost got *shot* while you were passed out drunk!""

Macbeth's face twisted into something dark and furious.

""You think you're some hero now, Finney? Think you're some martyr because you weren't shot by some Soviet bank robber?"" Macbeth jeered, red-faced and breathing hard.

Finney could smell alcohol in his breath. He felt something break inside him, like a tether snapping loose.

""No, Martin, I think I'm lucky,"" he said, his voice low and shaking, ""Lucky I had someone there who actually cared. One who doesn't hide behind excuses and leave his friends to fend for themselves while he drinks himself to death, alone in his apartment, on *a monday* of all days, just because he doesn't know how to handle a divorce like a normal fucking person.""

A deafening silence followed, broken only when Finney continued.

""I can see now, by the way. I can see why Carol left you. You're not smart. You're not tough. You're just pathetic. Always have been. And you're a very, very sorry excuse for a husband. You're lucky she left you the house, but I bet that, too, was out of pity.""

Macbeth's mouth worked open and closed like a dying fish.

Without another word, he turned and stormed out, rattling the glass in the frame as he slammed the door.

Second day in a row.

Second time he left the shop in ruins behind him.

 

The rest of the afternoon passed strangely quiet.

The man continued to work alongside Finney like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Checking customers out. Organizing the comic books. Straightening the rack of chewing gum.

Still silent.

Still watching.

By the time he flipped the ""Closed"" sign at 7 p.m., Finney almost felt like they had settled into a rhythm.

He was wiping down the counter when the man spoke his first full sentence.

""You were there Thursday night. At the Rusty Crab.""

The words were quiet.

Measured.

Final.

Finney froze, the rag slack in his hand.

""I… no,"" he stammered. ""No, I wasn't. I was home. I was–""

But when he looked up, the man was already gone.

 

That night, Finney trudged home under the eerie orange glow of the streetlights.

The world felt… off. Like the ground had tilted slightly, just enough to make walking strange.

When he reached his apartment door, he noticed it immediately.

A small box, sitting neatly at the foot of the doorframe.

Wrapped in torn, faded red paper.

No note. No name.

Finney crouched down slowly, heart hammering in his chest.

He peeled away the damp paper with trembling fingers.

Inside was a red sweater.

Simple. Itchy-looking.

Exactly like the one described in the missing person report.

Finney stared at it for a long, long time, the weight of it growing heavier in his hands by the second.

Across the street, under the halo of a streetlamp, he thought – no, he *knew* – he saw the faint outline of a man in a dark blue suit.

Watching.

Waiting.

 

Finney barely slept that night.

The red sweater sat balled up in the corner of his apartment, like a bloodstain he couldn't scrub out.

When he finally drifted into a light, uneasy sleep, he dreamed of water. A river. Pulling him along the shore. Pulling him out to sea, out to sea so far even the lighthouses wouldn't spot him. Pulling him away from Havre de Grace. Away from Maryland. Away from his corner store. Away from Macbeth. Away from the man in the blue suit. Away from that cursed red sweater that still sat crumpled, across from the windowsill, where the moonlight illuminated the bright red fabric…

 

**––––––––––––––––––––––– Thursday, October 23, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

Finney woke abruptly a few minutes before his alarm. He found himself staring at the ceiling until it went off. He continued staring, unsure what to do, as it wailed uselessly on the nightstand. Does he go back to work? Does he leave town? Does he go to the sheriff? No, he couldn't go to the sheriff. Or leave town. Not yet. He needed answers.

The corner store bell gave a weak jingle as Finney slipped inside, the morning sun hidden behind a suffocating wall of gray clouds.

The man, of course, was already there. Next to the register, he was wiping down the counter with his usual napkin.

A newspaper sat folded neatly on the part of the counter that had already been wiped.

Finney hesitated near the door. The man nodded politely. Finney said nothing.

Finally, Finney crossed the creaky wooden floor, pretending to busy himself with the battered crate of records stacked by the far wall. His fingers leafed through dusty sleeves – Johnny Cash, The Supremes, Wanda Jackson – but his mind was elsewhere.

On the box at his door.

On the sweater.

On the man.

The tension grew thicker than bisque.

 

Finally, he spoke, voice low. ""I saw you yesterday. After you left. Across the street from my house.""

The man gave no reaction.

Finney swallowed. The Jimi Hendrix record in his hands suddenly felt too fragile, too loud. He set it down carefully and turned.

""You left a box. A little *gift*. Right outside my door.""

The man still didn't look up.

Finney took a slow step forward.

""I think you know what was inside,"" he continued, trying to keep the tremor out of his voice. ""A red sweater.""

Still nothing.

Finney exhaled sharply through his nose as he walked right up to the counter. ""It was Bobby's, wasn't it?"" He curled his right hand into a fist, pounding it on the smooth Formica. ""Wasn't it?!""

Finally, the man shifted slightly, the barest flicker of movement.

A breath.

A blink.

Finney's eyes darted down – and that's when he noticed it.

An edition of *The Havre Times*, two days old, lying on the table between them.

Oct. 22, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

DRISCOLL FOUND DEAD IN BAY

Authorities have confirmed that the body of Robert Driscoll, reported missing last Friday, has been recovered at the mouth of the Susquehanna River near the Chesapeake Bay. Driscoll, aged 31, was found by Sherrif Paylor following an anonymous tip. He was not wearing his red sweater. Havre de Grace Police Department has not released an official cause of death, but foul play is suspected. Locals are urged to remain vigilant.

 

Finney's stomach twisted.

There it was, in black and white.

*Missing his sweater.*

*Foul play.*

He looked back at the man, whose eyes were now steadily fixed on him.

""Did you… kill him?"" Finney asked, voice cracking on the last word.

A customer jostled the door open, rattling the bell, cutting the tension like a blunt knife.

Finney jerked back instinctively, pasting on a shaky smile as a young woman wandered in, carrying a leather handbag and a handful of loose change.

The man slowly folded the newspaper shut, creasing it neatly, and tucked it under his arm.

Finney watched him for a long, taut second before forcing himself back behind the counter. He felt like he was walking across a tightrope suspended above the Grand Canyon.

The conversation was over.

For now.

The woman smiled politely as she set down a pack of sewing needles and a jar of Granny Hawkins' Old-Fashioned dill pickles.

Finney rang her up on autopilot.

 

The day carried on like a tired sigh.

Customers came and went – some looking for canned soup, some poking through the comic bins, one elderly man who insisted the store used to carry lemon drops and demanded to speak to the ""soused Englishman"" who sold them to him years ago.

Finney tried to act normal. He even cracked a few jokes.

But his mind kept drifting back to the newspaper.

To Bobby.

To the man, whom he kept his distance from.

The minutes crawled by. The sky outside shifted from gray to dark gray to the charcoal-blue of dusk.

At 6:57 p.m., just before closing, the man stood and walked quietly to the door.

Finney moved to follow. ""Hey! I'm not-""

But the bell jingled, the door swung shot, and by the time Finney stepped outside, the man was gone.

Finney sighed and returned inside, ready to flip the sign to ""Closed"", when the door slammed open again.

""Wait! Wait!""

The baseball kid skidded across the tile, breathless, clutching a few coins and a bent dollar.

""You're still open, right?!""

Finney blinked, then smiled faintly. ""Geez, kid. Barely. Whatcha need? Still after Mickey Mantle?""

""Yes, sir!"" The kid raced to the counter, eyes wide with excitement. ""Topps pack, please! The red foil one!""

Finney rang him up, tossed in a Bazooka gum for free, and watched as the boy bolted out again into the night, ripping the foil open before he even reached the sidewalk.

Then the shop was quiet once more.

Finney locked the door.

And left.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––––––– Friday, October 24, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next morning, the sun was unusually sharp for October.

Finney arrived early. The man was already there.

As usual.

They exchanged no words. Finney didn't try. Not today.

The hours passed without incident. The store had fallen into its familiar rhythm – customers drifting through like ghosts, Finney restocking shelves, the man ringing up purchases.

At noon, the bell above the door jingled.

Macbeth.

He paused at the entrance, as if expecting to be yelled at.

Finney just looked up from the register and said flatly, ""What do you want?""

Macbeth gave a long sigh. ""Just grabbin' me things.""

He shuffled behind the counter and crouched to rummage through his desk drawer. For once, he wasn't yelling, muttering, or grumbling about government conspiracies. He didn't even seem intoxicated.

Just quiet.

Finney glanced over. ""You find what you need?""

Macbeth held up a crumpled photograph of a striking woman and an old tin of breath mints. ""Just the essentials.""

He straightened up. Hesitated.

 

""Y'know, George,"" Macbeth started, ""You've been a good mate for years, but you're a bloody hypocrite.""

Finney raised an eyebrow. ""Come again?""

""You blew up at me for leaving you to handle the shop alone."" Macbeth's voice wasn't angry. More tired than anything. ""But I've never pouted when you've gone off an' done the same thing to me. Last Christmas. Independence Day weekend. End of September. Bloody hell, you did it two weeks ago!""

Finney cocked his head, looking confused. ""I don't-""

""No."" Macbeth cut him off. ""Save it for someone who still cares.""

They stood there in silence for a minute. Finally, Macbeth huffed and shook his head.

""For the record, I still don't trust 'im."" He jerked his thumb toward the corner, where the man was stacking books. ""That weirdo you replaced me with. Saw him outside my house on Tuesday when we last spoke. He wasn't watching me, he was watching the road, but still. I don't like him. And I don't like *you* with him. Just… be careful, mate, alright?""

Finney didn't answer.

Macbeth didn't wait for one.

He turned and left, the bell over the door jingling faintly behind him.

 

That night, Finney didn't eat dinner. He didn’t even turn on the lights. He just sat in his kitchen, watching the faint glow of the moon as it crawled across his floor.

Watching the new box he discovered on his porch, slightly smaller than the one that held the sweater from before but still wrapped in the same faded red paper.

He wanted nothing to do with this new box.

But he had to open it. Right?

Finally, he built up the courage to grab it. He set it down on his kitchen table before slowly peeling it open.

Inside was a baseball card.

The blue ink of the autograph glistened in the moonlight.

Jack DiLauro.

The same card he'd seen five days ago.

The same card the kid traded for.

There was a slip of folded paper taped to the back of the card.

Finney staggered back against the doorframe, heart hammering so loudly he could hear it echoing in his ears.

Written on the paper were four words, scrawled in tight, shaky handwriting.

""You were there too.""

 

**––––––––––––––––––––––––– Saturday, October 25, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

Saturday morning, Finney didn't go to the shop.

He couldn't.

He sat at his kitchen table for hours, staring blankly as Jack DiLauro's face smiled back at him.

The four words – *You were there too* – burned into his brain like a metal brand.

Finally, around noon, his nerves frayed to threads, he picked up the card and shoved it deep into the back of his junk drawer, under an old newspaper.

Out of sight, out of mind.

He told himself he'd call Macbeth. Tell him everything. Tell him he was right all along.

But when he dialed Macbeth's number, there was no answer.

He called again, only for the same result.

Nothing but the repetitive chime of a reorder tone indicating a disconnected line.

Finney slammed the phone down so hard it cracked the receiver.

 

He didn't sleep at all that night. He sat up in his bed, staring at the sweater balled up in the corner. As if it would move if he looked away. Eventually, he fixed his gaze onto his reflection in the mirror on the wall. His reflection that didn't care whether he was good or bad, happy or

depressed, scared or lonely. His reflection that was always the same stupid face staring back at him.

He began to move restlessly from room to room, glancing out the window in the kitchen at the crooked streetlamp across the road. It flickered now and then, buzzing faintly, casting long, strange shadows.

Once, just once, he thought he saw the man standing there again.

But when he blinked, it was only a twisted blue mailbox.

Eventually, he returned to his bed.

It was then that he finally got some rest, if only for a few hours.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––––––––– Sunday, October 26, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

Just as the first rays of sun began to crack through the blinds, Finney woke up, crawling out of bed and back into the kitchen. With shaky fingers, he dug into the junk drawer and pulled out the baseball card again, throwing the old newspaper that sat over it onto the kitchen table.

He stared at DiLauro's face for a long time before carefully slipping the card into his wallet and forcing himself to prepare breakfast.

Toast. Burnt. A hard-boiled egg. A glass of the milk he borrowed from his store.

Nothing tasted right.

He tried to focus on the food, but his eyes kept flicking to the old newspaper.

Finally, he read the headline.

Jul. 29, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

LOCAL CLERK FOUND DEAD IN HOME

Martin Macbeth, a longtime clerk at Bay View Corner Store, was found deceased in his home yesterday afternoon. Neighbors contacted authorities after noticing a foul aroma and unusual silence. Upon entry, police discovered Macbeth unresponsive on the floor of his living room.

The medical examiner has confirmed the cause of death as acute alcohol poisoning. Bottles of whiskey, gin, and beer were found scattered throughout the residence. Police report no signs of foul play.

Macbeth was 42 years old. Known for his blunt demeanor and loyal tenure at Bay View, he is survived only by his ex-wife, Caroline Hartsoe, who now lives in Nashville and has declined to comment.

Finney dropped his fork.

Egg yolk spurt across the table.

He felt the blood drain from his face.

That couldn't be right. He had spoken to Macbeth yesterday. Hadn't he?

The shouting. The picture of the woman. The tin of mints.

The warning.

But the paper was dated months ago.

 

The rest of the day blurred. He didn't remember getting dressed, only that at some point he was back outside.

Back in front of the corner store.

The bell jingled ever-so faintly as he pushed open the door.

And there he was.

The man. Of course.

Wiping down the counter with that same folded napkin.

Finney stepped inside, the door swinging shut behind him with a creak.

The man nodded.

Finney began walking towards the man. ""Who are you?"" he demanded. ""What do you want from me?""

No answer.

""I don't know what the hell is going on, and I can't help you until I do."" Finney continued. ""What do you want?!""

At last, the man set down the napkin.

When he spoke, his voice was more confident than usual. Not hollow or timid. Just… real.

""You keep asking the wrong questions.""

Finney stared. ""Then what are the right ones?""

The man tilted his head. ""What did you see? What do you remember?""

""I don't-""

""You were there.""

Finney's breath caught.

""You… I didn't…""

""But you did.""

Finney was silent.

The man continued. ""The guiltiest man is he who feigns innocence.""

Finney stammered. ""I- I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you want from me. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME!""

He lunged forward, fury overtaking fear. He grabbed the man's lapel, tried to shove him back–

And stumbled through the air.

There was no one there.

Only the counter.

Only silence.

Finney stood alone.

As he had for some time.

 

**––––––––––––––––––––––––––– Monday, October 27, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The following morning, Sheriff Paylor stood in front of Bay View Corner Store. He sighed.

A young boy had vanished a few days ago.

Paylor thinks the boy ran away from home. His parents swore he'd just gone out late for baseball cards and was to return within the hour.

He checked the store Saturday, but it was closed. He went home and waited on a warrant.

Now, Monday morning, the front door was unlocked. Someone had been there. Warrant in hand, he stepped inside.

The bell jingled overhead.

The place was silent.

The register was untouched.

The comics still in neat stacks.

No sign of George Finney, the sole worker.

Paylor walked slowly toward the counter.

A newspaper sat unfolded beneath the till.

Oct. 25, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

LOCAL BOY REPORTED MISSING

It was Saturday's issue announcing the boy's disappearance.

Wait – That's odd.

The words ""baseball cards"" in the article's body were circled in red ink.

Next to the paper, Paylor found a one-way plane ticket, scheduled to depart from Baltimore that very morning.

Flight TWA 11 -- BAL to SFO

There was no sign it had ever been used.

*Christ, George*, thought Paylor, *San Francisco?*

There was just one more thing on the counter:

A Jack DiLauro baseball card.

Uncreased.

Autographed.

Two words written on the back.

Now i have awful constipation (I am sure it's from menopause but (?) and inability to digest anything after 10pm....I will go in the morning after coffee but then it always seems to be backed up, never fully eliminate...

Could these be symptoms of H Pylori? Scared to take antibiotic regimen because it messes so terribly with my gut. ",2,1746166878.0,HPylori,1,1.0,False
