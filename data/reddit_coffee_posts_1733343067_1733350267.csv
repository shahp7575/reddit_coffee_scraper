Dates available: December 15 - Jan 5.   
  
Beautiful, sunny, 1100 sq.ft apartment, the third floor of a classic Victorian triple-decker in Somerville right on the Cambridge line. Comfortably furnished with a loungey living room, a separate dining room with seating for six, an unusually large and updated bathroom, a main bedroom with a queen size bed, and a second bedroom / office with a full size bed. Large east-facing porch gets enough morning sun that you will likely be able to have your morning coffee outside even in December. Ridiculous number of house plants. Kitchen is fully stocked in terms of appliances and essential tools, and free laundry is in the basement. Very comfortable apartment for a couple or small family!  
  
A cat normally lives in this apartment but he will be staying with the sitter. If you would like to bring your cat or dog, let's talk about it!  If you'd like to have a cat as a roommate while having our cat sitter visit once a day for the feeding and cleaning, we are down with that!  If you want to be the cat sitter yourself for a rent discount (and have strong cat experience), let's talk!  
  
We are located one block away from Porter Square on the Cambridge/Somerville line, where you will find the T (metro), a commuter rail station, a large supermarket, a bookstore, coffee shops, restaurants, a CVS, and several gyms. Also a ten minute walk from hip Davis Square, which has an independent movie theater and several lively bars and music venues. On the train you'll be one stop from Harvard, three stops from MIT, and about 25 minutes to downtown Boston. We're also a few blocks from a mixed use community path which provides great walking and cycling access to Boston in one direction and historic suburbs like Lexington in the other direction.

>I struggle with giving gifts and most of the people I'm buying for struggle with knowing what to ask for. I had the idea this year of giving everyone a small bag of useful/cool stocking stuffer-type items, since adults don't often get that kind of present.

>Some of the items I'm thinking of:  
Metal bookmarks, keychain swords, keychain flashlights, miniature magnetic chess game, yes/no decision coin, wooden brain teaser puzzles, mini multitool, keychain jewelry box, miniature crossbow.

>I thought I'd mix one larger item with a handful of smaller items in each bag, and then add some individually wrapped fancy chocolates or other candies. Is this a good idea or a bad idea? If it's a good idea, what are some other small items I could include?

Grownup stocking stuffers are a fantastic idea! It brings a nostalgic, festive element to gift-giving that adults often miss out on, while also being practical and thoughtful. Mixing small, intriguing items with a few high-quality treats can create memorable, personalized gift bags. Here’s how to elevate your concept and include some creative additions:

1h6s0ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h6s0ff/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_celebrate_with_my_family/,AITAH for not wanting to celebrate with my family again after 2years of disappointment?,"I (f21) had my birthday yesterday (yay ) and actually just wanted to spend it with my friends. The reason for this is that I was massively disappointed by my family last year. I baked a cake last year and invited them for coffee. My family arrived 2 hours late and left after 45 minutes. Apart from the fact that my father wasn't there because he was “ill“. After this flop, I didn't want to celebrate this year at all.

Now one of my brothers had his birthday a few days before mine and we celebrated at his place. During the party, my parents kept asking me when I wanted to celebrate. I told them I won’t celebrate at all after what they did last year. However, as I'm a miserable people pleaser and they got on my nerves the whole evening, I gave in and told them to come round for coffee. So I got up early on my birthday, baked and bought drinks.

First some friends and then my grandma came around for a bit and all in all it was a lovely day until 30 min after the agreed time, my mum called to say that she and my siblings wouldn't be able to make it for coffee and my dad wouldn't be coming at all. She said they would come round later so we could have dinner together. I, who of course hadn't prepared anything, simply ordered some pizza. My family arrived at the same time as the food and disappeared again about 45 min later. I was furious and told my mum that this evening was the last time I invited them round. Now she thinks I'm the one to blame and my brothers also sent me messages saying I shouldn't be such a baby but I won’t accept that. 

So, Am I the AH? P.S: Yes my parents are known in the family for always being late or not coming at all depending on their mood, I just always thought that at least with their children’s birthday they would make an effort…

There I was, sitting on my old, uncomfortable couch that’s seen better days (trust me, it’s hard to have a “productive meeting” in a spot where the springs have basically declared war on your backside). I had this idea—an idea so bright and shiny that it sparkled like those awful disco balls. But the reality? I was broke, flat broke, as in I just got a “congratulations-you-are-now-a-graduated-student-now-pay-us-back” letter, and I was fresh out of funds and fancy business plans.

It felt like I was trying to build a rocket with a box of macaroni and cheese. But as I sat there pondering how to get from daydreaming to launching, I was struck by a thought: I wasn’t alone in this. Faith had always been that ever-present voice in my head, gentle yet firm. And it reminded me that while my bank account was more like a ghost town, my ambitions didn’t have to be. 

First off, let’s talk practical steps, because I’m all about action—not just good intentions:

1. **Leverage Your Network:** I made a list of everyone I knew—friends, family, that one neighbor who always talks about his cat, even my barista. I started leaning into these connections. They had skills, insights, and often, a smattering of wisdom sprinkled from their own experiences. Plus, who doesn’t love free advice over coffee? 

2. **Work Your Skills (however limited they may seem):** I took stock of what I could offer. I realized I had a knack for writing—not Shakespeare levels, but enough to stick messages on a public bathroom wall if needed. I began freelancing where I could, using every opportunity to sharpen my skills while bringing in a bit of cash. Yes, it felt like pushing a boulder uphill at times, and my ego took a few hits, but hey, character development, right?

3. **Utilize Free Resources:** I discovered precious gems online—YouTube tutorials, podcasts, and free webinars that were teaching me everything from branding to building a website. I mean, I was practically schooling myself in the art of “How to Avoid Paying for Anything.” The Internet’s a treasure trove; just sift through the endless cat videos.

4. **Say Yes to Opportunities:** Whenever someone invited me to an event or a gathering, I jumped on it. You never know who you’ll meet. That one awkward encounter at a not-so-subtle networking event? Yeah, that turned into my first client. In the words of Isaiah 41:10, “Do not fear, for I am with you.” Faith became my safety harness in a world where I felt like I was walking a tightrope.

5. **Prayer and Reflection:** On days when I felt like giving up, I turned to prayer. I spent time reflecting on what truly mattered. Somehow, knowing that I was part of a bigger picture, that my journey wasn’t solely dependent on my own strength, breathed life into my weary spirit.

Through every hurdle—rejection emails, ghosting clients, the thrill of checking my bank account and it being mercifully not zero—I kept praying and trusting God’s plan. It’s remarkable how keeping faith during those times feels like holding onto a buoy in an ocean of self-doubt and fear.

And here’s the kicker: looking back, it was those early struggles—the ones where I felt utterly alone—that God used to build my character and deepen my faith. As I navigated the tumultuous waters of starting from scratch, it became evident that I was crafting not just a business, but a testimony.

So, if you’re out there with nothing but a dream and a zeal that outweighs your reading ability for budget spreadsheets, know this: with some practical steps, a heart open to God’s leading, and a little elbow grease, you can launch not just from scratch but soar far beyond your expectations.

So, about two years ago, I (M22) went on a few dates with this girl (F21). We spent time together, even stayed over at each other's places a few times, but it was always platonic—just spooning, no kissing or hand-holding. I could feel her slipping away, so I panicked and called her for a conversation where she said she really enjoyed our time but would rather stay friends. After that, we kept in touch through our mutual friend group, but I kind of kept hoping things would change, even though I did go on dates with other people.

Recently, we've been seeing each other more often. We started going to the gym together, studying together, grabbing coffee, and sometimes going for walks during school breaks. We would talk about personal things, but never about dating or relationships. I’ve always felt this underlying tension between us, and whenever we talk, it’s like there's this “unspoken thing” hanging in the air.

About two weeks ago, we went to an art gallery for a class, and after, I suggested going to a Christmas fair. At first, she said she couldn’t because of work, but then 15 minutes later, she texted me saying she could come after all because she’d told work she was sick. That got me thinking- what a weird move is this? especially since she would go out of her way for a casual hangout like that.

The Tuesday after that, I asked her to the gym again, and talked to some friends about the Christmas fair situation. They thought it sounded like a date, and I started to wonder. So, I had it in my mind to ask her to hang out, but make it clear it would be a “date”. But before I could, she asked me if we could do arts and crafts together(the kind of thing we haven’t done since she friend zoned me). We planned it for the Sunday after next (coming up this weekend).

Then, last weekend, our friend group had a movie night planned, but it got cancelled last minute. I texted her about it, and she was a bit disappointed but said she was going to visit her parents instead. I suggested we watch a movie together instead, and she agreed saying visiting her parents would work out anyway. We ended up having a nice time at her place, just the two of us. I really wanted to kiss her during the movie, but I didn’t feel like she was showing any interest, so I didn’t. When I left, I still couldn’t tell if she wanted a kiss or not, and there was no hug or anything as I left.

Here’s the thing—I feel like every time things between us seem to be moving in the right direction, she pulls back again. It’s like we take one step forward and then a couple steps back. I can’t help but feel this tension between us. We do date-like things together, but never talk about our dating lives or address the tension that’s always there. It feels like we’re stuck in this awkward place where there’s something unsaid. I’m not convinced she likes me in a romantic way, but I also can’t ignore this strange feeling when we hang out.
I’m at a crossroads now. I’ve been holding onto hope, but I really can’t keep pretending to just be friends when I have feelings for her. I know I should probably talk to her about it, but ofc I’m worried that bringing it up could destroy our friendship. But in my right mind I would say that I can’t handle this going on for any longer because that would drive me even more crazy than knowing she doesn’t like me, because than I can kind of go on.

I mean, I could also just wait to see it all play out. But I want to at least clear the air on this tension I’m feeling.

Any advice on how I should handle this situation? I want to say at least something about it upcoming Sunday during our arts and crafts thing but I really don’t know the right move now.",1,1733347881.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1h6rrl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/housekeeping/comments/1h6rrl1/etiquette_check_cleaner_moving_things_around/,Etiquette check - cleaner moving things around,"Hi all,

  
Eager for some feedback on whether or how to raise something with our cleaner. We have a new-ish cleaner coming every week while our previous cleaner is out on maternity leave. Generally, she's been doing a great job and is honestly more detail-oriented than our previous cleaner which I truly appreciate. 

However, one thing that I'm finding frustrating is that she completely re-organizes any shelves or table tops in the home every time she cleans. To be clear, I am not talking about things not being slightly out of place, which I wouldn't notice or care about. I mean that built-in shelves with books, photos, decorative objects as well things like the coffee table are \*completely\* re-arranged. It's always done in a way that looks nice - honestly almost like it's a fun hobby for her to re-style it every time! - but I'm finding it a little over the top. Both because in some instances I spend time re-arranging things how they were before when she leaves, but also because it's like she's spending more and more time on this when I'd much rather her focus on cleaning! 

I totally respect that part of it is her moving things to actually clean the shelves, so I don't want to be unfair or make her feel like things need to be put back EXACTLY how they were for us to be ok with them, but is there a way to raise this in a way that is reasonable or am I just being unfair?

Thanks so much!

1h6rq2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h6rq2j/is_this_the_definition_of_having_drifted_apart/,Is this the definition of having drifted apart?,"Looking for advice.  We’ve been married for over 20 years, 2 adult children out of the house and one high schooler still at home. It seems like over the years, we have either grown less and less compatible, or simply stopped trying to modify who we were and our daily life preferences so that we would be more compatible. The biggest thing has been our routines and sleep schedules. I was always a morning person and she was a night person, but as time went on we both became extreme in our tendencies. There are several nights a month when I am getting up when she is going to bed-4am. This cuts down on the time we have together significantly and our opportunities to do fun things together. She wants to do stuff at night, I want to sleep. I want to do stuff in the morning, she wants to sleep. Her work schedule is pretty flexible so she can work and sleep as late as she wants, mine is extremely rigid so I have to be up early. So we mostly end up doing things by ourselves. I have lots of hobbies, almost all active and outdoors that I enjoy, and I pursue them. But never with her anymore. I invite her but she’s just not interested, or too busy, or both. She on the other hand essentially has no hobbies at this point other than watching shows on her computer or playing computer games. She has two friends who she will occasionally grab coffee with on the weekend. Other than that, she works. Nearly all the time. An insane amount of hours. When she is up until 4 am it is because she is working. More often it is until 2am, but she probably works 70 hours a week most weeks, sometimes more. She sometimes sleeps only 4 hours a night. She has a high paid, salaried position, and the truth is I don’t really know if she needs to work as much as she does, or she just likes it, or both. But the money is nice. I have a professional career and work 40-55 hours a week depending on the time of year, and she makes 3 times what I do. She is not stingy at all and shares it with me freely, which is great for me. 

Another big problem: there is essentially no romance. I think this is for multiple reasons. First, lack of time, or rather, neither of us makes it a priority. On top of that, our schedules are not conducive to it at all, we have a teenager in the house, and frankly she doesn’t make any effort on her appearance except when she has an important work function, or a holiday gathering at someone else’s house, which means it is essentially never for me. This may not be an issue for some people, but I don’t feel much attraction to someone who spends most of the time they work from home in their pajamas and without bathing. Anything even remotely sexy? Never. I want someone to try to look sexy for me. I take very good care of my physical appearance and I am in very good shape. I don’t expect her to do as much as I do, but I wish she would do something. We end up being intimate at this point about once every three months. To me that’s almost nothing. I am not losing my mind over it, but I would be lying if I said it wasn’t something that I feel I am missing in my life. I don’t have any concerns about infidelity. Maybe that is naivete, or the fact that I am not a particularly jealous person. If she was actually having satisfying sex with someone else, or even just a hook up with someone in her field she rarely sees at a conference or something, a big part of me would be really happy for her. Frustrated for me, but happy for her. But I highly doubt it. She has never been the least bit secretive about anything. I just think she has little to no interest in sex. I don’t want to come off as conceited, but I am quite physically attractive, and I am always here if she wants it. But at this point, neither of us approaches or initiates much at all, because there are so few opportunities when the teenager isn’t home and she isn’t intently staring at a computer screen unshowered in her pajamas, usually working, but sometimes playing a game or watching a show. 

Even when we vacation, most of the time we don’t even vacation together anymore. Not only do our sleep schedules not line up, our work/vacation schedules also rarely line up, and as I noted earlier, we don’t really like to do the same things anymore anyways. So I’ll go one place with one of the kids, and she will go somewhere else with another kid, or I’ll go somewhere by myself and she will go visit family. But we don’t really travel together anymore. 

And here’s the thing. There is still a lot of love. I love and care about her deeply, and I think she feels the same way about me. We respect each other. I don’t even think there is any resentment. We are family. But our lives don’t really line up at all anymore other than the kids and dealing with the house and chores. It feels like we are roommates with kids who platonically love each other. 

I still feel like if we made it a priority we could get the spark back. But I don’t feel like either one of us is willing to make the changes to our lifestyle that would be necessary to get that spark back.

Finally, while we have had small conversations about all of this, and have tried to plan weekends away, because they weren’t prioritized, something has always come up and then they don’t happen. The last time we actually got away was a year ago. We also both have to be very careful about what we say and how we say it, because we are both somewhat frustrated with each other's inflexibility to change to the other person's lifestyle, and we both become defensive quite quickly and can point to each other’s contributions to the situation and it just becomes an unproductive blame session. 

So I feel stuck, and I feel like she is stuck as well. Both somewhat unhappy, but not unhappy enough to walk away or fix things. I guess I really don’t know if I am looking for advice, or just commiseration, but I would appreciate anyone’s thoughts.",2,1733347690.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False
1h6rpha,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1h6rpha/advice_on_buying_a_used_nespresso_machine/,Advice on buying a used Nespresso machine,"Hi all, recently had a big change in life circumstances (moved states, new job that is remote 90% of the time) and decided to up my coffee game — specifically after working in a previous job with a nespresso machine in one office and an espresso machine in another. 

Part of me wanted an espresso machine to get into the hobby, but I *never* drink my coffee black - so my coffee loving friends told me that it might be far more cost effective for me to go down the Nespresso route. 

I just want an efficient way to make some form of milk coffee in the morning; but want an upgrade to instant coffee (which apparently has lower caffeine content too!) 

My palette is (apparently) really humble — I am satisfied with McDonald's coffee when same friends think it tastes like mud. 

So I was hoping to save some $$$ by buying a used Nespresso machine on FB marketplace, but there are so many on offer. Some questions :

\- Apart from the Vertuo line (which apparently takes a proprietary pods and is incompatible with 3rd party pods like those from Starbucks), do all the other machines produce the same quality of coffee but with varying qualities of how it froths the milk? e.g., The Lattisima vs the Creatista seems to be similarly priced in the used market, but the RRP seems to be quite different!

\- What are things I should look out for when inspecting a used Nespresso machine? Are there parts that commonly fail?

Especially after seeing people claim they lost a lot of weight with the “honey diet” on Twitter, so for the past two weeks I’ve been experimenting with trying to eat more peaty. 
Unfortunately I’ve gained a total of 8 lbs in the past 2 weeks 😩. I’ve always struggled with my weight but never gained it this fast before. 
Started at 165 and now I’m 173 today. 
Granted, 3 of those lbs is probably inflammation/water weight since I just started weight lifting again a few days ago. But DAMN. Lol I wasn’t ready when I looked at the scale today. 

My diet was already pretty clean for most part prior. I don’t eat out much or eat a lot of processed/artificial food. 
I cook most of my food at home with no PUFAS. But I have a sweet tooth and used to eat a lot of homemade pastries.

For the past few weeks, the changes I made were cutting out the pastries, and eating more fruits and natural simple sugars + coffee/tea sweetened with honey. Especially in the beginning of the day. 
Then for lunch or dinner, I usually eat high protein with moderate carbs.
Usually beef + rice/tortilla wrap/potatoes
Or chicken + rice with some veggies. 
Eggs for a snack or breakfast sometimes. 

Also bought some gelatin to add into my diet as well.

I read that coconut oil helped boost metabolism so I ate 1-2tbs a day and added it to my coffee and food and ice cream sometimes when I wanted a treat. 

I think the coconut oil is what may have did me in because honestly, this diet isn’t that much different than what I was doing before, except that. I also think it caused a lot of gastric distress for me because every time I consumed it, I’d have lots of gas and acid reflux afterwards. Plus I had the WORST constipation of my life during this time. 

My body temperature also seemed to DECREASE from the coconut oil. When I stopped using it a few days ago, my waking and mid day temps rose. 

I don’t think my body agrees with it for some reason. 
I know I didn’t implement the diet perfectly, but I really wasn’t expecting these results lol. 
Is there anything you guys would suggest to change for better results?

So i am well aware of things like rage bait and AI especially on Facebook. But one thing i can’t stand is when someone shows a video making something fun but its totally a treat and then all the comments are from adults like “well that’s one way to get diabetes” do we just assume that when we see these things that this happens on a regular basis? Do we think that if we see a kid out in the world eating a cupcake that that’s all that kid eats? 

The video was probably a bit over the top, because it was a mock coffee drink using caramel on the cup and then chocolate milk topped with whipped cream. My immediate thought was oh that’s a fun little treat. But every comment was just an adult screaming about how unhealthy it is. Like no duh! So are donuts. So is cake. But we never say that at. Birthday party because it’s expected.

I get my daughter a cake pop and chocolate milk everytime i go to Starbucks if she is with me. But every time means maybe twice a month. I either go without her or not at all. Every Sunday we get donuts for breakfast. Then the rest of the time she eats balanced meals. 

Why is that if i showed her eating donuts we all assume that’s all she eats? We really just need to start using our logical thinking skills and assume most parents are not feeding their kids sugary drinks on a regular basis. ",1,1733346920.0,Parenting,1,0.67,False

Hi, Hello, Hey. Hope your evening is going well! I know you’ve been waiting for a post that isn’t like the rest of them so I’ll try to do my best. 

I’m using bullet points on my post because this kinda is like a resume, don’t you think?

• I spend most of my early mornings drinking coffee outside to brace for my day. 

• My career is a pretty hectic one that takes a lot of critical thinking and understanding complex situations. 

• Because of my career, I’m a pretty simple man on my days off. I enjoy my own company, the ability to appreciate quiet and the outdoors. 

• Most days if I’m not at work, you can find me in the gym or close to a pond fishing. 

• I have some pretty hot takes, the first being that socks absolutely do not belong in bed. Argue your point with me if you will. 

• Craft beer is delicious and I try to find a cool little brewery in every small town I go in. 

• Because of my love for craft beer, see my previous statement about the gym. 

• My love language is 100% making fun of you. If you can’t take it or are gonna take it personal, I’m not the guy for you. 

Let’s be friends, huh? Talk soon!

Also the trainers aren't employees who aren't being paid for the job btw they're literally designated trainers.....They even have this whole policy where they're inclusive to all disabilities and neurodivergents when clearly not if you're getting snarky that a completely new person doesn't understand how to make like 50 sophisticated products within 3 days? The burnout is already killing me but I know if i practice and get used to the job I can handle it but the pressure of having all this information dumped on me and being expected to know it immediately is so bad i hate working so much my brain is not built for this and dealing with judgemental neurotypicals,1,1733346287.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old woman from Central Europe whose mother tongue is German, looking for a partner to share life’s ups, downs, and all the in-betweens. Let me be upfront: I’m not here for friendship but to find someone who’s ready for a meaningful connection. If we realize we don’t fit romantically, friendship is a lovely fallback, but my intention is clear—I’m searching for my person.



**A little about me:**

I’m tall (185 cm/6’1”), curvy, and have a sharp sense of humor that keeps people on their toes. My love for audiobooks, especially crime thrillers, means I’m often solving fictional mysteries (occasionally getting it wrong). When I’m not lost in an audiobook, I enjoy hiking with my mischievous dachshund, exploring new places, or unwinding with knitting and a cup of coffee or tea.



Travel is my big passion, especially to northern regions. I’m not the type to spend 10 days roasting on a beach; I’d rather explore cities, soak up the sea breeze, or find hidden gems off the beaten path. That said, I equally appreciate a cozy night at home.



**A few practical details:**

I’ve never been married, don’t have kids, and am not looking to change that. Physical appearance doesn’t matter much to me—I’m drawn to intelligence, wit, and meaningful conversations that can go in any direction. I’m looking for someone who can connect with me openly and consistently. Sporadic “Hi” messages every other week aren’t my thing—I want a genuine connection.



If this resonates with you and you’re up for sharing your story, send me a message! And please, no one-liners; I’d appreciate if you told me something about yourself.



Looking forward to hearing from you!

Cheers!",2,1733346213.0,r4r,1,0.67,False
1h6r45k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wheelchairs/comments/1h6r45k/how_to_find_accessible_social_gatherings_as_a/,How to find accessible social gatherings as a wheelchair user?,"Hi. So, my problem is, I learned a couple of years ago that I feel pretty low if I'm not hanging out with a group of people. I was using social groups, like on meetup, to fill that gap in my life until recently.



Medical info, if you want details. >!I started using a wheelchair during a very bad health crash a couple of years ago where I couldn't get off the couch without being straight-up exhausted - it's a combination of POTS, Ehlers-Danlos joint instability, stupid spine issues we're still investigating, and MCAS limiting my ability to exert myself in general. Like, I stood up in five minute bursts while baking last week, and I was sick with flu-like symptoms (PEM) until yesterday. If you ask my partner (and the ATP did ask), I also had a lot of falls. When he asked me, I said they didn't count because I fell with proper form and/or caught myself on the way down almost every time.!<

Anyway, I say all this to say, I am an ambulatory user, but I can't actually manage standing or walking outside my home. I am also \_very\_ easily fatigued.

I used to save up my energy to go to meet-ups for a social group that I loved, where I had a lot of friends, and I was on the board and everything. They switched to a new venue that the leader just loved, and she realized while walking out that the venue was completely inaccessible to me. Its outdoor seating is in a gravel pit, so no wheelchair and not safe for walking, its indoor seating is all pub-height tables and chairs, and it has zero disabled access parking spots, zero ramps, and a curb all the way around the parking lot, so not really doable in a chair.

I've also tried to go to a local Go club (the boardgame, yeah) in my city, and it's in an extremely cramped coffee house that I could barely navigate back when I was using a cane. I had to explain to people then that I couldn't stand up much and beg for a spare chair.

So that's the crux of my question: how tf do I rebuild a social network and quit being isolated all day at home when I have severely limited energy and basically no mobility outside of my wheelchair?

Thanks for your help, it's really hitting me hard in the mentals lately!",3,1733346191.0,wheelchairs,0,1.0,False

>So my boyfriend and I are in a cross-continental long distance relationship. I won't be able to celebrate his birthday with him this year and I wanted to see if anyone had an idea of any ideas for what to gift him. I was thinking of some kind of gift box featuring some of his favourite things but if I was to do this myself, the international shipping cost would be crazy. Does anyone know any US businesses/companies that offer these kind of services so I can save on the shipping fees but still get him something nice?

Here are some thoughtful and practical gift ideas for your long-distance boyfriend that are both meaningful and within your $150 budget:

# 1. Customized Gift Boxes (US-based services)

Can I just do weight training? ,"I’m 5’4, 125lbs and I am so sick of cardio. Never really did weight training but I’d like to switch over. Right now I’m doing :

Going to the gym 3xs a week ( goal is at least 5 days. We’ll get there) 

Leg press 100xs @ 35-40lbs

Inner thigh abductors 75Xs @28lbs 

Outer thigh abductors 75Xs @ 28lbs or something 

Reverse leg curl 75Xs @ 30lbs 

That weird ab machine where you crunch yourself 30xs @ I think 30lbs because owe oh my god holy hell are those hard ( it hurts to laugh now) 

Will incorporate that hip thrust thing with the bar bell across my hips. Anything else you can recommend?  

My diet is pretty healthy. Lots of veggies, tofu, chicken, fruit. Trying SO HARD to cut out at least half my sugar intake ( damn you, coffee bean dirty matchas with your damn green siren call of bliss!) 
I try to eat only whole foods, but I’m not perfect. Really sugar is my big vice here.

You all were my lifeline during this journey. When I felt overwhelmed, unsure, or even like giving up, this community was there with advice, encouragement, and understanding.

Because of everything I learned from you, I was able to exclusively pump for a whole year and provide my baby with breast milk despite all the challenges. I never thought I could make it this far, but your shared stories and tips gave me the strength and tools I needed.

I’m incredibly grateful for the support and solidarity this group offers—it’s truly special. I hope the tips I’ve compiled can help other moms in their journey too. Thank you for everything; you’ve made a huge impact on my life and my baby’s well-being.

# Tips for Increasing Milk Supply

## Key Essentials

1. **Correct Flange Size**: The most important step in effective pumping is ensuring the correct flange size. Use a nipple ruler or consult a lactation consultant to determine the appropriate size.

## Proven Strategies

1. **Frequent Pumping**: Pump a minimum of 8 times per day for at least 15 minutes or until empty. Do not exceed 6 hours between sessions.
2. **Effective Emptying**: Empty your breasts thoroughly. If nursing, pump for 20 minutes after the baby finishes feeding while massaging your breasts.
3. **Power Pumping**: Incorporate one power-pumping session per day to mimic cluster feeding and boost supply.
4. **Middle of the Night Pumping** (MOTN): Pump at least once between 1 AM and 4 AM when prolactin levels are highest to signal your body to produce milk round the clock.

## Nutrition and Hydration

1. **Hydration**: Drink at least 12 cups of water daily, including warm water during your first morning pump. Coconut water and hydration drinks  are also beneficial.
2. **Balanced Diet**:
   - **Oatmeal**: Have oatmeal for breakfast with oat milk, almonds, flaxseed, brewer’s yeast, and brown sugar.
   - **Dates with Sesame Seeds**: A nutrient-rich snack to support lactation.
   -high calorie food, any high calorie food would boost your milk supply so chocolates, some junk food, I used to drink avocado with honey juice and would pump so much after it. 

   - **Coconut Products**: Add coconut milk to meals or a spoonful of coconut oil to your coffee or food.
   - **Chamomile and Moringa Tea**: Both are believed to enhance milk production and promote relaxation.
3. **Supplements**:
   - Brewer’s yeast (debittered tablets or in non-alcoholic beer).
   - Sunflower lecithin to prevent clogs.
-legendairy milk supplements did help me boost my supply but they are pricey and only work with excessive pumping schedule and not on their own 
   - Fenugreek (note: monitor its effects as it may decrease supply in some cases).
4. **Check Iron and B12 Levels**: Low iron or B12 levels can impact milk supply. Iron supplements significantly improved my supply when I started taking them.

## Lifestyle Adjustments

1. **Reduce Stress**: Stress significantly impacts supply. Find ""micro-moments"" of relaxation, such as playing games or enjoying downtime.

2. **Skin-to-Skin Contact**: Hold your baby often and let them sniff or root at your breast to stimulate production without pressure to latch.
3. **Adequate Sleep**: Prioritize rest whenever possible.

## Pump Maintenance

1. **Replace Pump Parts**: Regularly swap out worn pump parts (every month if you pump more than 4 times a day and 2 months if less) especially duckbills and backflow protectors.
2. **Correct Equipment Usage**: Ensure your pump settings are comfortable and effective.

## Additional Tips

- **Warm Compresses**: Apply a warm compress or massage before and during pumping to encourage let-down and do compressions while pumping by Squeeze top/middle of breasts during pumps. Hold boob like you'd hold a burger and do gentle squeezes. You'll find own rhythm of how long for and how often. Some people do pulsing compressions but mine work best holding the squeeze. Also you'll find best position. Mine is on top of breast so my hand makes an ""n"" shape
- **Visual Stimulation**: Look at photos or videos of your baby while pumping to stimulate let-down.
- **Eating Well**: A balanced diet rich in proteins and healthy fats is essential. Avoid skipping meals.
- **Frequent Milk Removal**: The most effective way to increase supply is to remove milk frequently and thoroughly.

By following these tips consistently, you can support and maintain a healthy milk supply. Remember, every breastfeeding journey is unique, so adapt these strategies to suit your needs.",2,1733345532.0,ExclusivelyPumping,1,1.0,False

1h6qrvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1h6qrvh/friends_have_no_life_outside_of_their_boyfriends/,Friends have no life outside of their boyfriends,"Prefacing this post to clarify - I have amazing friends. I do not ever take for granted that I have a supportive community of diverse female friends. I am also unusually lucky in that most of them live locally to me, several even walking distance, and we’re able to get together more than the average friend group because we live in a major city.

However, it’s still frustrating to navigate making time for girl time as the only/one of the few single women in my extended social circle. I am admittedly more outgoing than the average person, and perhaps need more quality time than the average woman as I have no family connections or relatives, I just have my friends. Several of my girlfriends have no life or interests separate from their boyfriends. It is like pulling teeth to get some of them to leave the house without their boyfriend. They have no distinct hobbies of their own and except for on occasion, won’t pursue any outing that is not tied to something he’s interested in. If someone plans a girls only get-together, they ask if their bf can come along, and when told no, make up an excuse and don’t attend. 

It’s not uncommon for, when plans do make it out the group chat, the plans to be cut short or several women anxiously center how much time they’ll plan around their boyfriend’s availability. I have been invited out with it framed as “Hey girlie! (Boyfriend’s name) is busy this weekend, do you want to hang out?” or I’ll make one on one plans to get drinks or coffee, we’ll meet up briefly, then she’ll say “well (boyfriend) is off work now, so I’m gonna go hang out with him now, bye!” Like am I a babysitter? 😭 Do I only exist to you when your bf is too busy to entertain you? Most of these women live with their men too, and remain up under him 24/7 at home. You don’t get tired of him and need space? It’s ridiculous. 

The most perplexing is the women with boyfriends who ARE highly social and outgoing - their man is a musician, artist, etc just has some sort of hobby their girlfriends always show up to support. But the girlfriends, my friends, don’t really have any outlet or creative endeavor their men in turn support. I will say I think its somewhat normal in a relationship for one person’s lifestyle to slightly dominate the other person’s, I think it can’t be helped all the time depending on a few factors. But as someone with a lot of external things going on (my small business, community work, socializing, local thrift markets, etc) I can’t fathom just following a dude around to uplift his interests and having none of my own. I wish more of my girlfriends had a “thing”, even if its just knitting, yoga, whatever, something!

Additionally, every woman I’m venting about is not my only or closest friend, it’s just a pattern I’ve noticed and can hardly believe. So this is not an issue of “get new friends!” For every 2-3 women I know like this, I know one who is a bit more outgoing. I feel like its widely discussed how women get into relationships and forget they have friendships, but I don’t see as much discussion on how codependent some women can become. Don’t get me started on the financial aspect of it too - I know multiple women who actually become less social when single because they’re used to their boyfriend paying for everything and so can’t really afford to go out to do things without him. But that’s maybe another conversation.

Anyways I don’t make this post to knock how other people navigate relationships, I’m sure this dynamic can be worked positively for some, it just has me incredulous. ",26,1733345372.0,TwoXChromosomes,9,0.78,False

1h6qiov,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1h6qiov/advice_on_talking_with_exs_teen_stepdaughter/,Advice on talking with ex’s teen stepdaughter,"Yea, it’s a weird title but let me explain! Ex-husband and I are both (happily) remarried to other people. We are coparents of two wonderful boys. The older of these two boys is the same age as his stepsister— the current stepdaughter of my ex. 

Ok— so we don’t have one of those close families, so I don’t know stepdaughter very well. Wasn’t too worried about that until I was asked to help pick her up from school along with the son we coparent. I pick her up 5 days a week and she’s polite. Riding home and her hanging out on our couch on her phone until she was picked up was/is fine with me. 

We’re about halfway through the school year, and son (that she goes to school with) now has a couple of days a week he stays after for extracurricular activities. Kids not in the activity aren’t allowed to stay and her parents are at when school lets out. School is a bit of a drive from the house and traffic is too heavy to take her home then go back to the school. I’ve opted to instead take her to a coffee shop near the school for the hour or so we wait 1-2 days a week. 

I have not problem with her on her phone at the coffee shop. I either use my phone or bring a book. However, we now much longer times together just the two of us. Sometimes I can hit on something and she talks… a couple of sentences. There are long awkward pauses and sometimes I say stuff and she looks at me like I have two heads. 

Fine… she’s a teen and I’m the ex wife of her stepdad. Still, I’m a sucker for wanting to improve things. I’m not looking to be her friend, develop a deep everlasting bond BUT filling the 5 minute or so wait of drinks being made would be nice. 

In addition, I’ve always struggled to communicate with people. I’m fond of talking but easily thrown off and will say something… odd… so yea…

1h6qh3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HydrogenWaterFast/comments/1h6qh3z/water_diets_for_weight_loss/,Water Diets For Weight Loss,"The Effectiveness of Water Diets for Weight Loss: Myths and Facts
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Water diets have gained significant attention in recent years as a potential solution for those looking to shed pounds. But how effective are they really for weight loss? In this article, we will explore the myths and facts surrounding water diets to help you make an informed decision.

### What is a Water Diet?

A water diet primarily involves consuming large amounts of water while significantly limiting calorie intake. The idea is that water can help you feel full while your body uses stored fat for energy. While this concept sounds appealing, the effectiveness and safety of this practice can vary widely.

### Common Myths About Water Diets

- **Myth 1:** Drinking water alone leads to sustainable weight loss.
- **Myth 2:** Water diets can replace balanced meals entirely.
- **Myth 3:** You can drink as much water as you want without any side effects.
- **Myth 4:** Water diets guarantee quick results without effort.

### Fact Checks on Water Diets

1. **Temporary Weight Loss:** One undeniable fact is that a water diet may lead to temporary weight loss. When you reduce your caloric intake and increase your water consumption, your body will rapidly shed excess water weight. However, this is not sustainable long-term.
2. **Fluid Regulation:** While hydration is crucial, excessive water can lead to a condition called hyponatremia, or water intoxication. This occurs when sodium levels in the blood become dangerously low, leading to confusion and other severe health issues.
3. **Lack of Nutrients:** A water diet does not provide essential nutrients that your body needs. Prolonged periods of nutrient deficiency can lead to health problems like weakened immunity, brittle bones, and muscle loss.
4. **Emailing Your Metabolism:** Reducing calorie intake drastically can slow down your metabolism. When your body senses that it is not getting enough energy, it may enter a starvation mode, making it harder to lose weight over time.

### How to Effectively Incorporate Water in Your Weight Loss Journey

If you're considering a water diet, it’s crucial to approach it in a safe and balanced way. Here are some effective strategies:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Stay Hydrated:** Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Proper hydration can help curb hunger and boost your metabolism.
- **Integrate with a Balanced Diet:** Instead of solely relying on water, combine it with a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. This approach ensures you receive essential nutrients.
- **Mindful Eating:** Pay attention to your hunger cues. Eating slowly can help you enjoy your meals more and recognize when you're full.
- **Exercise Regularly:** Combine drinking water with regular physical activity. Exercise not only burns calories but also fosters better overall health.

### Understanding the Limitations

Water diets may appeal to many due to their simplicity, but it is essential to recognize their limitations. While they may produce short-term results, they are not a solution for sustainable weight loss. The key to effective weight management lies in incorporating healthy eating habits, regular exercise, and proper hydration.

### Consulting a Professional

Before embarking on any diet regimen, especially one that heavily focuses on water consumption, it is always a wise move to consult a healthcare professional. They can provide personalized advice tailored to your health needs and goals.

Water diets can offer short-lived weight loss results, but they come with significant drawbacks. Understanding the myths versus the facts can empower you to make healthier choices for your body. Remember, a balanced approach is the most effective way to reach and maintain your weight loss goals.

How to Properly Implement a Water Diet in Your Daily Routine
------------------------------------------------------------

Implementing a water diet into your daily routine can be a refreshing and effective way to aid in weight loss. This approach focuses on increasing your water intake to improve hydration, boost metabolism, and help control hunger pangs. When done correctly, it can lead to positive changes in your overall health and wellness.

To start, it's crucial to understand how a water diet works. When you consume enough water, it helps your body function optimally. Water plays a vital role in digestion, nutrient absorption, and detoxification. Additionally, drinking water before meals can help you feel fuller, reducing the likelihood of overeating.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Here are some practical steps on how to properly implement a water diet:

- **Start Your Day with Water:** Begin each morning by drinking a glass of water as soon as you wake up. This kickstarts your metabolism and helps hydrate your body after hours of sleep.
- **Set Reminders:** To ensure you're drinking enough water throughout the day, set reminders on your phone or use a water-tracking app. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water daily.
- **Infuse Your Water:** If plain water feels bland, try infusing it with fruits, herbs, or vegetables. Lemon, cucumber, mint, and berries can add delicious flavors, making you more likely to drink enough.
- **Drink Before Meals:** Make it a habit to drink one or two glasses of water before each meal. This can help you eat less by curbing your appetite and improving digestion.
- **Replace Sugary Drinks:** Substitute sugary sodas, juices, and other high-calorie beverages with water. This simple switch can significantly reduce your daily calorie intake.
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keep a reusable water bottle with you at all times. Having access to water makes it easier to hydrate throughout the day. Consider a bottle that measures your water intake, encouraging you to reach your goals.
- **Monitor Urine Color:** A good indicator of hydration is the color of your urine. Aim for light yellow urine, which suggests proper hydration. Dark urine may mean you need to increase your water intake.

While you focus on drinking more water, it's important not to neglect solid food altogether. Instead, incorporate foods that have high water content into your meals. Fruits and vegetables such as cucumbers, watermelons, oranges, and lettuce can contribute to your hydration while providing essential nutrients. They are low in calories and can make you feel full, supporting your weight loss goals.

Adopting a water diet might also require some adjustments in your daily routine. For instance, if you're accustomed to grabbing coffee or energy drinks in the morning, consider swapping them out for water. This change can help reduce caffeine dependence and decrease sugar cravings. Remember that small changes can lead to significant results over time.

Another essential aspect of a water diet is listening to your body. Sometimes, people confuse thirst with hunger. Pay attention to your body's signals; if you feel hungry shortly after drinking water, try to wait for a little while before eating. This practice can help you determine if you are genuinely hungry or just dehydrated.

Furthermore, it's crucial to recognize any potential drawbacks. Rapidly increasing your water intake may lead to frequent trips to the bathroom, which can be inconvenient. Be aware that very high water intake can lead to water intoxication, although this is rare. It's always best to strike a balance while ensuring you remain adequately hydrated.

Remember that a water diet should not replace a balanced diet. It should serve as a complement to your eating habits. regular physical activity and mindful eating practices alongside your increased water intake will enhance your results. the goal of a water diet for weight loss is to promote healthy living rather than just shedding pounds quickly.

By gradually implementing these steps into your daily routine and adjusting as necessary, you can successfully incorporate a water diet into your lifestyle. Drinking more water is a simple yet powerful strategy for achieving your weight loss goals and improving your health.

The Role of Hydration in Overall Health and Weight Loss
-------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, and its impact on overall health and weight loss is substantial. Staying hydrated affects every aspect of your body, from physical health to mental clarity. By understanding how hydration plays a role in your weight loss journey, you can make informed choices that promote a healthy lifestyle.

### Why Hydration Matters

Our bodies are composed of around 60% water. Every cellular function hinges on this vital liquid. When you're adequately hydrated, your body operates efficiently. On the flip side, dehydration can lead to a range of health issues, including fatigue, digestive problems, and even cognitive decline.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
#### Key Benefits of Staying Hydrated

- **Boosts Metabolism:** Drinking water can increase your metabolic rate temporarily. Studies have shown that drinking about 500 ml of water can boost metabolism by up to 30% for roughly 30-40 minutes.
- **Reduces Appetite:** Sometimes, we confuse thirst with hunger. Drinking water before meals can help you feel fuller faster, leading to lower calorie intake.
- **Enhances Physical Performance:** Hydration is critical during exercise. Even mild dehydration can reduce your strength and endurance, making workouts less effective.
- **Flushes Out Toxins:** Drinking water helps your kidneys function better, eliminating waste and toxins from your body.

### Hydration and Weight Loss

A water diet, or increasing your water intake, can significantly aid weight loss. By replacing high-calorie beverages with water, you reduce your overall calorie intake, helping you shed pounds more effectively. But how does this work?

#### Strategies for Using Water in Your Diet

1. **Drink Water Before Meals:** Aim for a glass of water about 30 minutes before eating. This simple habit can help control hunger and prevent overeating.
2. **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keeping a reusable water bottle with you ensures you stay hydrated throughout the day. Set reminders to refill and drink regularly.
3. **Flavor Your Water:** If plain water doesn’t excite you, add slices of fruits like lemon, cucumber, or berries to enhance the flavor without adding calories.
4. **Replace Sugary Drinks:** Swap out soda, juice, and alcohol for water. This change alone can lead to significant calorie savings and promote immediate weight loss.

### Common Misconceptions

Despite its benefits, there are some misconceptions about hydration in the context of weight loss. Here are a few:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Water Alone Will Cause Weight Loss:** While water helps in weight management, it's not a standalone solution. A balanced diet combined with regular exercise is essential for sustainable weight loss.
- **Not Drinking Enough Water is Unnoticeable:** Many people don't realize they're dehydrated. Signs of dehydration, like headaches and fatigue, can affect your overall performance and mood.

#### Practical Tips for Increasing Your Water Intake

Staying hydrated doesn’t have to be a chore. Here are practical solutions to help you drink more water throughout the day:

- **Set a Daily Goal:** Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water a day.
- **Infuse Water with Spices:** Spices like mint or ginger can make water more appealing.
- **Use a Tracking App:** Various apps can help you monitor your daily water intake and remind you to drink.

### The Ideal Hydration Routine

The key to effective hydration revolves around consistency. Incorporate these practices daily to ensure you’re making the most of the benefits:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
1. Start your day with a glass of water.
2. Set reminders on your phone to drink water every hour.
3. Include hydrating foods in your meals; fruits and vegetables have high water content.

Hydration is a simple yet powerful tool in the quest for overall health and weight loss. By understanding its benefits and making conscious efforts to increase your water intake, you can pave the way for a healthier lifestyle. As you incorporate these strategies, you'll likely notice an improvement in your well-being, energy levels, and ability to manage weight effectively.

Comparing Water Diets with Other Popular Weight Loss Strategies
---------------------------------------------------------------

Exploring various weight loss strategies can be overwhelming. One notable method is the water diet, which focuses on increasing water intake for weight loss. This approach offers a unique perspective compared to other popular diets. Below, we’ll compare the water diet with various other weight loss strategies, helping you understand their differences and potential benefits.

The water diet encourages individuals to drink significant amounts of water each day. The idea is to replace high-calorie beverages with water, which can reduce overall calorie intake. When employed correctly, it may enhance hydration, curb appetite, and promote healthier eating habits. People often wonder how it stacks up against other common strategies, such as low-carb, intermittent fasting, and ketogenic diets.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
**1. Water Diet vs. Low-Carb Diets**

Low-carb diets, like Atkins or the Paleo diet, focus on reducing carbohydrate intake to encourage the body to burn fat for energy. While these diets can lead to quick weight loss due to reduced water retention and glycogen stores, they often require careful meal planning and can be restrictive.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Water Diet:** Simple and less restrictive, focusing mainly on hydration.
- **Low-Carb Diet:** Requires limiting specific food groups, which may feel more challenging for some people.

The simplicity of the water diet makes it accessible for many. However, those following low-carb diets often report a greater variety of food options and sustained energy levels once they adapt.

**2. Water Diet vs. Intermittent Fasting**

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained popularity for its structured eating windows. This method isn’t so much about what you eat but when you eat. It emphasizes periods of eating followed by fasting, often leading to calorie reduction and improved metabolic health.

- **Water Diet:** Primarily focuses on water intake throughout the day, without strict eating windows.
- **Intermittent Fasting:** Requires more discipline with eating times, which may be hard for some to maintain.

While both methods can lead to weight loss, intermittent fasting may offer additional metabolic benefits, such as improved insulin sensitivity. In contrast, the water diet is easier to start but might be less effective for long-term weight management.

**3. Water Diet vs. Ketogenic Diet**

The ketogenic diet, or keto, focuses on high-fat and low-carbohydrate intake. This approach aims to shift the body into a state of ketosis, where it burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. Keto often yields rapid weight loss initially due to a significant drop in water weight associated with reduced carbohydrate storage.

 Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Water Diet:** No strict macros; focused on drinking water and reducing caloric beverages.
- **Keto Diet:** Requires strict adherence to macronutrient ratios to achieve ketosis.

For those seeking structure and willing to commit to specific macronutrient ratios, the ketogenic diet may provide more targeted results. However, the water diet is more flexible and can be a helpful starting point before diving into more complex diets.

**4. Water Diet vs. Calorie-Counting**

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Calorie counting is a classic weight-loss strategy that involves tracking food intake to maintain a caloric deficit. Many people find success with this method, as it allows for a wide variety of foods as long as they fit within their daily caloric limits. However, it can become tedious for some.

- **Water Diet:** Less emphasis on tracking food intake, prioritizes hydration.
- **Calorie Counting:** Requires diligence in tracking every meal and snack.

The water diet's primary focus on hydration can simplify the weight loss journey, making it appealing for those who may struggle with the complexities of calorie counting. However, calorie counting offers precise control over intake and might be more effective for those who prefer a structured approach.

In essence, each weight loss method has its pros and cons. The water diet is straightforward, emphasizing hydration and reducing calorie consumption through healthier beverage choices. In contrast, other strategies like low-carb, intermittent fasting, ketogenic, and calorie counting offer varied paths toward achieving weight loss goals. Choosing the right approach ultimately depends on your lifestyle, preferences, and long-term weight management aspirations.

Common Mistakes to Avoid When Following a Water Diet
----------------------------------------------------

Following a water diet can seem like a simple and effective way to lose weight. However, many people make common mistakes that can hinder their progress and negatively affect their health. Understanding what these pitfalls are can help you navigate your journey more effectively. Here are some key mistakes to avoid when embarking on a water diet.

### Neglecting Nutrient Intake

One of the biggest mistakes people make on a water diet is reducing their food intake too drastically. Consuming only water for extended periods can deprive your body of essential vitamins and minerals. This can lead to fatigue, muscle loss, and other health issues. Instead of completely cutting out food, consider incorporating small, nutrient-dense meals. Eating fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can provide necessary nutrition while still focusing on water enhancement.

### Ignoring Body Signals

Your body communicates its needs, and ignoring these signals can be detrimental. When following a water diet, it's vital to listen to your body. If you're feeling dizzy, overly fatigued, or weak, you might not be drinking enough water or eating enough nutrients. Always pay attention to how you feel and adjust accordingly. Staying hydrated is important, but it's equally crucial to maintain a balanced diet.

### Setting Unrealistic Expectations

Expecting rapid weight loss can lead to disappointment. While water diets may contribute to initial weight loss, this is often temporary and can include water weight rather than fat loss. Aim for gradual, sustainable weight loss. It’s healthier and more achievable over time, and you'll be less likely to abandon your efforts due to frustration. Remember, consistency and long-term changes yield the best results.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Not Drinking Enough Water

While it may sound counterintuitive, many people undertaking a water diet forget to drink enough water throughout the day. Make it a goal to consume at least eight glasses of water daily. Carry a refillable water bottle with you and set reminders to drink. Staying hydrated helps your metabolism, improves digestion, and can even curb your appetite. Ensuring an adequate water intake is essential for the effectiveness of your water diet.

### Overlooking the Importance of Exercise

Another mistake often made is neglecting physical activity. While a water diet can help with weight loss, combining it with regular exercise amplifies benefits. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week. strength training can further enhance your results by building muscle and boosting metabolism. Find activities you enjoy, such as walking, swimming, or cycling, to make exercise a regular part of your routine.

### Diving into Extreme Variations

Some people might think that the more extreme their water diet, the better the results. This approach can backfire. Extreme water diets can foster harmful habits and lead to serious health risks. For example, excessively limiting your intake can result in electrolyte imbalance or nutrient deficiencies. Strive for balance, and if you're uncertain, consider seeking professional guidance from a nutritionist or dietitian.

### Neglecting Hydration Sources

It's important to remember that hydration doesn't solely come from drinking water. Many foods contain high water content and can aid your hydration efforts. fruits like cucumbers, oranges, and watermelon can enhance your hydration while providing essential nutrients. Count these towards your daily water intake to stay healthy and satisfied.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Disregarding Personal Preferences

A water diet should not be a one-size-fits-all approach. Disregarding personal tastes and preferences can make it challenging to stick to your plan. Find ways to enjoy water, whether that means infusing it with fruits or trying herbal teas. You can also explore various recipes that incorporate water-rich ingredients to keep your meals enjoyable and interesting.

### Not Seeking Support

Embarking on a water diet can feel overwhelming, and navigating it alone can be tough. Seeking support from friends, family, or even online communities can provide accountability and motivation. Sharing your experiences can offer fresh insights and help you connect with others on the same journey, making the process feel less isolating.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
By steering clear of these common mistakes, you'll be better positioned to achieve your weight loss goals through a water diet. Stay mindful, listen to your body, and embrace a balanced approach for the most successful results.

### Conclusion

Embarking on a water diet can be an intriguing approach to weight loss, but understanding its effectiveness requires separating myths from facts. While drinking water helps control hunger and can support your weight loss efforts, it isn't a miracle solution on its own. Integrating it properly into your daily routine is key. Aim to drink water consistently throughout the day, and combine it with nutrient-dense foods to ensure you’re not just filling up on H2O.

Hydration plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and boosting your metabolism. Staying adequately hydrated not only supports bodily functions but can also enhance your weight loss journey. When you compare water diets with other popular weight loss strategies, you'll find that while they can be effective, they require careful management and should ideally complement other healthy habits.

It's vital to identify and avoid common mistakes that many make when following a water diet. Over-restricting calories or neglecting other food groups may lead to nutrient deficiencies and unsustainable weight loss. Remember to listen to your body, and ensure you’re getting a balanced diet alongside your hydration efforts.

Ultimately, a successful water diet is about balance and mindfulness. It can support your weight loss goals when done correctly, making hydration an essential ally in your health journey. So, if you're considering a water diet, approach it with knowledge and a focus on overall wellness, ensuring lasting benefits for both your body and mind.

We got on really well and hung out the next morning for a few hours For coffee before I flew home. We spoke every day for two weeks and he asked to fly me back to where he lives for a couple of nights so he could take me on a proper date. He asked if I'd want to stay with him or in a hotel, I told him I'd feel more comfortable in a hotel, but that I could pay for it, but he insisted he would pay for the whole trip. He picked me up from the airport, we went for lunches, dinners, he paid for everything. I've never been wined and dined like that before ( I don't drink alcohol so i wasn't an expensive date lol). He spoke about being a traditional man that likes to pay for everything. He kept telling me how much he liked me, that I'm the most beautiful woman he's met, and he can't wait to spend more time together. On my way home, my flight got cancelled and I had to purchase another flight which I did myself because I had to get back for work urgently. It was $600. 

We spoke the first two days of me getting back home, he was still as sweet of ever and I wanted to send him a small gift to his home to thank him for looking after me all weekend. I asked him after a couple of days of being home, if he could help me at all with the cost of the flight back. We spoke while I was with him on the weekend about my situation, I'm in the middle of a divorce and have two young children. My ex has a lot of money, but it's not my money. He knows I live in a big house and drive a nice car, but again, it isn't my money. He was very aware of all of this as we spoke in-depth about it the weekend we were together. Money has been very tight for me as I've been trying to pay for lawyers and all my personal items by myself without my exes help. 

It's been 24 hours now and since I asked him, very kindly I might add, if he could help me with the cost of my new ticket, and I've heard nothing back from him. I tried calling him once, no response. He hasn't reached out either about the gift I sent him. I was just trying to be thoughtful to thank him for being so sweet.

I met my co worker in september, two weeks into October we started hanging out, doing errands, grocery shopping. We sometimes play fight on who takes the next food bill when we would go eat. I started picking her up before work, taking her home and on occation im off that day but she does I would gladly give her a ride to work when she is runing late id even pick up some breakfast or lunch depending on her shift so she wasnt rushing. She even ""borrowed"" one of my hoodies when she forgot hers and now wears it at work everyday and tells me its her favorite sweater, idk if its cause its warm or because its mine lol. When I first dropped her off at home it was a little akward we just stood there before saying bye and eventually she made the first move and started giving me hugs and now I give her a hug when I see her and drop her off. 2~3 days ago I was 2 hours away and running late for work. I texted her first letting her know I was going to be a bit late and I couldnt pick her up and that I was really really sorry. After that day idk what happend she felt distant. We didnt talk the entire shift or even take our breaks and lunch together. After work we went grocery shopping and when I told her Id hold the basket or the items she said ""[Name] you dont have to do anything anymore, its okay"". Its been 3 days and she hasnt replied to any of my text. Ive asked her to hang out or to go get food or coffee and nothing no replies. I honestly dont know what I did wrong.

1h6q2p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1h6q2p6/ordered_a_jultra/,Ordered a J-Ultra. ,"My wife bought me a Flair 58 last Christmas, which I’ve loved, but I’ve wanted to buy another grinder for a while. 

I already had a 1Zpresso X-Pro that I used for pourover before I got the F58, and that has been the only grinder I’ve used with the F58 for the last year. 

The X-Pro is great for pourover, especially light to med roasts, and I’ve found it to work very well for some coffees on espresso with the F58, but, with a lot of coffees, it tends to bring out the acidity too much, resulting in what I perceive to be harshness. 

I heard about the J-Ultra going on sale for $159 (through the OEM), but was bummed to find that they were sold out by the time I went to place an order. 

However, I noticed that they were available even cheaper through AliExpress. I couldn’t resist one of 1ZP’s top grinders for $150 and change shipped to my door (that’s less than what I paid for my X-Pro!), so I ordered one. 

So my question is for those who have both the X-Pro and the J-Ultra: What is your experience? What kinds of coffees are you enjoying with your J-Ultra and Flair? Would you consider the J-Ultra more forgiving than the X-Pro with espresso? 

Some of my favorite coffees through the F58 have been Onyx Geometry, Brandywine Ethiopia Worka Anaerobic Natural, Crema (Nashville) Winter Sun Blend, Crema Kainmui Peaberry, etc. Mostly light to med. stuff. My favorite coffees tend to be African - Ethiopians and Kenyans. Also had some Colombians that were awesome. 

My typical shots are typically 20:40, either straight 9 bar or declining pressure profile (measured manually with the gauge; I don’t have a profiling device). I always set the temp to max, and usually set the kettle to 200°. I aim for <30 seconds. ",5,1733343636.0,FlairEspresso,1,1.0,False
1h6q215,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoaffective/comments/1h6q215/does_anyone_else_struggle_with_spirituality/,Does anyone else struggle with spirituality? ,"I’m medicated and currently stable but 
Sometimes I get strong intuitions or dreams that seem like a spiritual gift, or whatever people want to call it.  

For example,  all my life my family would say if a bird hits your window it announces death, this happened once in my life and I started calling my family to see if everyone was ok, or asking if anyone is currently sick.  The night of the incident I get a call from a cousin saying that my dad took his own life. I thought it was the weirdest coincidence. (For context my biological dad dipped and got milk when I was 4 and never came back, so we had no relationship or contact with him for 17 years )

Another example, is that I pick up nature stuff, rocks and pine cones, I dry flowers, I just love nature. One morning before going to meet a friend I hadn’t seen in a very long time, the pinecone kept getting stuck in my scarf and it annoyed me so much.  I made it to the coffee date and me and my friend were showing off tattoos we got recently and she shows me her tattoo of a pinecone that she got done to remember her mother who’s just passed. She mentioned she had a dream that she was playing cards with her mom and to her it meant she was okay, and I said well I think she’s showing you that she’s always with you. 

The most recent is that, I had a dream my grandma was being put to sleep(like you euthanize animals) later that day she brought her dog to vet and he unexpectedly had to be put down and it really bugs me, that same morning I had bought a necklace saying “I crossed the rainbow bridge knowing I was loved.” 

It just weirds me the fuck out. 

These coincidences make it hard for me to be like, nah it’s all in your head. I’m trying to rationalize it, and my mom just reinforces it saying “you have a strong intuition for these things”. Bro I don’t want this intuition or whatever they claim that I have. 

I’m mentally ill and people saying that I’m spiritually gifted makes me scared. ",3,1733343592.0,schizoaffective,1,1.0,False

1h6q0ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Adventurous_Pin_1239/comments/1h6q0ct/about_me_living_document/,About Me [Living Document],"Hi and welcome.



In the next few paragraphs I’ll try my very best to put into words who I am. I aim to do a good enough job at communicating the most important information about myself, so that you can get a feel for how good a match we can be!



Without further ado…



\# Who am I?



I’m Alex, a 26 year old, bi-curious guy from Mexico, playing online. When I say bi-curious I mean exactly that: I’m mostly straight, but open to experiment with my sexuality. I don’t have any real experience in that regard, and while I appreciate a nice male body, I’m not sure if I’m actually attracted to them. There’s only one guess to be sure tho! So I’ll be on the lookout for an opportunity to figure that out. I do love women tho, no doubt about that.



I am in the software field (AI to be more precise), and I find it super fun and interesting! Right now I am doing a masters in AI, so my time is mostly spent either working, studying, or in my hobbies, and in the downtime I play on here.



I absolutely love coffee. I drink it black, and wouldn’t want to go a day without at least a good, steaming cup of black Joe. My hobbies include boardgames, outdoors activities like hiking, visiting new restaurants, traveling, and adrenaline filling activities: I love riding roller coasters, and I plan ti go skydiving later this year! I would love to pick up some new hobbies tho. I want to learn French, how to ride a horse, and how to fly an airplane. A bit of a mixed bag, but they all seem super interesting to me.



I’m nerdy, and my sister would call me a snob, but she’s just teasing. I think. I enjoy sharing and being told fun facts about history, geography, science (mostly science!) I also love math, in the sense that I appreciate what it has done for us as a society, and I feel like it’s a beautiful language. I also like watching (and pseudo analyzing) movies, mostly original and \*weird\* movies. Think The Lobster, Poor Things, and A24 Films. I just love being weirded out and trying to figure out what is going on and what is the message hidden in the content. I also looove sci-fi: Dune is my favorite book, Dark is my absolute favorite series, and I enjoy watching over and over Ex-Machina (Oscar Isaac is my crush). I also like fantasy, with TLotR being a yearly watch for me, and I’m waiting for the third book in the Kingkiller’s Chronicle. Sadly.



All of this info is about mild me. Wild me is adventurous and kinky. I fall into the dominant spectrum, and I am willing to try most things at least once (otherwise how would I know if I like them?). I am learning shibari, and I am educated in BDSM, so I not only enjoy it, I am also literate about it, which I find very important and would appreciate it in my partners.



\# How do I look like



I am 170cm (5’ 7”) and, last time I weighed myself, 60 kg (132 lbs). Whoever, my weight fluctuates quite a bit since I like going to the gym.



I have fair skin, hazelnut eyes, brown-ish hair (with just the slightest touch of red, when light hits me just right), and a short beard.



I like to keep myself well-groomed, clean and aesthetic.



\# What I am looking for



I would love to connect with a long-term chat partner :)



We can’t be horny all the time, so a mix of SFW (to make a connection) and NSFW (to spice it up) would be lovely. I enjoy chatting, sexting, and dirty talking. I also love trading pictures, but I understand the risks involved and I respect anyone who’s not willing to do it.



\# My ideal play partner



While I am bi-curious, right here and now I am only looking to play with women since I feel more attracted to them.



I won’t be able to be on here 24/7, and I don’t expect you to. We all have lives, so I would like to connect with someone who also understands that, and is communicative and respectful about each other’s time. I will be, and I would expect the same from any play partner, since it’s pretty awful to be left in the dark, not knowing if you were ghosted, or what’s going on.



\# Kinks



Now for the fun part! I have to get my own kink list, but in the meanwhile I’ll be updating this post to add/remove any kinks of mine. If you like the same stuff that I do, let me know!



If something is not included in this list feel free to ask, I’m open to discussing other kinks, and maybe I learn something new that I enjoy.



\## My favorite



\* \*\*Domination\*\*: I love being in control. Not necessarily in a physical way, more in a “I command, you obey” kind of way. My doming style can range from soft and sweet, but firm, to rough, physically throwing you around kind of way. To me the hottest part of this is imposing my will, having control of the situation. Whoever, I would classify me as a \*pleasure dom\*. I do like ordering around, but most times it is to make you feel good, get you in a different position so that I can go deeper, that kind of commands. At times it will be all about me tho, it really depends on the mood and the scene.

\* \*\*Orgasm/Pleasure control\*\*: More control! To me it’s super hot be in control of your pleasure, you being in the receiving end, submissive, and ready to cum for me. I just love feeling your body tense up, your breathing getting shorter and faster, until you release in a scream of pleasure, all thanks to me. I’ll set the rhythm, you would just obey and enjoy.

\* \*\*Bondage\*\*: I think you are seeing the pattern here. Bondage goes hand in hand with my previous kinks, and it’s more than anything another tool in my arsenal to control the situation, make sure you are just where I want you, ready to be pleasured. To me bondage includes rope, wrist and ankle restrains,  spreader bars, arm binders, collars, blindfolds, and gags.

\* \*\*Foreplay\*\*: In my opinion a nice foreplay session is the key to a great orgasm. Feeling each other, sharing breaths, hands, skin, tongue exploring every inch of our bodies, the tension rising, begging to be released. Usually the longer the better, but this is not. Strict rule. Quickies also have their place.

\* \*\*Cum\*\*: So, I mostly a giver, but when it comes my turn to, well, cum, I find it so hot to make a show out of it. Backshots, creampies, facials, filling you up. It’s such a strong and hot visual, it gets me horny and ready for a second round almost immediately.

\* \*\*Blowjobs\*\*: My favorite way of being pleasured. I like them deep, sloppy, and dirty. Deep throats are amazing, and the wetter the better. To me blowjobs are not about the physical sensation, it’s more about the visual, and the fact that it makes me feel in control.

\* \*\*Toys\*\*: I can do so many things with my mouth, my cock and my hands, but toys bring infinite possibilities to the table. They are so much fun! My favorite right now is a cock ring which vibrates. It gives me the strongest, longest lasting erections, all while doubling the pleasure my partner gets while being penetrated. My second favorite is a vibrator controlled remotely, which allows for some fun and hot situations, which brings me to…

\* \*\*Public play\*\*: The risk, the adrenaline makes it even more exciting. If the coast is clear we could have a quick fuck or a nice blowjob, but in crowded places a remote controlled vibrator does the trick just as well. Try to stay serious while I control the intensity of your pleasure, all while acting nonchalant.



\## I enjoy



\* \*\*Anal\*\*: It’s a different sensation, and I enjoy it, specially when it’s well lubricated and we take it sloooow at first, so that it doesn’t hurt.

\* \*\*Group play\*\*: Threesomes are a huge fantasy of mine. Mainly FMF, but I would be down for some MFM action. All hands on deck!

\* \*\*Spanking\*\*: With my hands, or with toys, I absolutely love the sound it makes. Even better when I am deep inside my partner, and she clenches in automatic response.

\* \*\*Praising\*\*: I enjoy being a soft dom, telling you what a good girl you are, that you are doing great, and that you look so fucking hot while slurping in my cock, princess.

\* \*\*Free use\*\*: Huge fantasy of mine. I would love to just use you whenever I want, and you are ready to take it.

\* \*\*Dirty talk\*\*: Not just in a roleplaying sense, but I also love to talk dirty in casual conversation.



\## Also hot



\* Humiliation

\* Spitting

\* Hair pulling

\* Choking

\* Cock worshipping

\* Going down on you

\* Rimming

\* Rough sex

\* Cuckqueanning



\# Limits



\* \*\*Scat, water sports, and bodily fluids\*\*: The only exception is cum, as indicated in my kink list.

\* \*\*Harsh Pain\*\*: I don’t enjoy inflicting long lasting pain. Spanking is okay, nipple torture is not (for me).

\* \*\*Violence\*\*: It turns me off when things turn violent.

\* \*\*Non-con\*\*: To me it’s hotter when we are both consenting. CNC would be okay tho.

\* \*\*Age gaps\*\*: I don’t mind playing someone in his thirties or forties, but anything older than that would be a no go for me.

\* \*\*Gore, vore, bestiality, illegal stuff\*\*: No kink shaming, it just doesn’t do it for me.



\# Pictures



I love trading pictures! Like I said, it’s not a requisite, but I find it so much hotter when we have a glimpse of each other.



I won’t (and won’t ask you to) share pictures with identifying details, nor will send my face. To me it’s about our bodies.



I will gladly send pictures of myself, but if you ask me to I would love for it to be reciprocated.



\# Miscellaneous\*

1h6q05w,https://i.redd.it/i0oak7w14w4e1.jpeg,Lost wallet on MTS 7 headed Downtown,"Sunday 11/24. Headed from Communal Coffee in North Park to Downtown on the 7. Lost my brand new Tan Leather wallet. Tried calling MTS and Communal but so far it hasn’t turned up. If you see it, DM me or post here and I’ll keep a lookout. 

I know this is a long shot but I just moved here and San Diego people have been friendly so I thought I’d try this. Thanks so much!

I’m talking he gets it every single day when they have it, I know they took it away last year so I’m assuming it’s a seasonal thing. 

Does anybody know if they’d sell me the syrup or what the exact brand they use in it is/where I can get it? I want to try to get him some for Christmas so he can have it until they bring it back next year. 

Thanks in advance!!",4,1733343115.0,TimHortons,5,0.75,False
1h6pu49,https://www.reddit.com/r/kidneydisease/comments/1h6pu49/blood_tests_and_blood_pressure_have_led_me_here/,Blood tests and blood pressure have led me here...,"Hi there, I'll try make it quick. First post... I'm a relatively fit, 54 year old man. Never been great at hydrating, a bit sloppy with salt and diet (I realize this will have to change...), drink sugary coffee daily, and a couple of beers a week, but no where near as much as I used to. Still play old man soccer and have been feeling pretty low energy over the last year. Had a lot of stress recently having lost my wife to cancer about a year and a half ago, so... maybe related? But mostly just worried about blood pressure testing consistently around 160/90 and blood came back showing 118/60 (creatinine/egfr) in September and then 122/58 a couple days ago. I realize after reading a bunch of posts that these numbers aren't the end of the world, but... Just a little nervous, and the blood pressure being that high seems a little bit much. Talking to my doctor tomorrow afternoon, just thought I'd say hello and see if anyone has any thoughts? Thanks! ",1,1733343069.0,kidneydisease,2,1.0,False
