I agree that we’re in a worse economic situation than our parents and grandparents were at our age. I’m not one of those “your $5 coffee is the reason you can’t afford a house” people. HOWEVER, I see a lot of my peers go on extravagant vacations (resorts, excursions, new outfits purchased specifically for the vacation) while they can barely pay their rent. Or insisting that they NEED to have a $300+ night out for every birthday. Not even including the hair, nails, lashes, and outfit they get for said birthday all while asking people to borrow money a few days later. 

And the constant eating out is crazy to me. If one more person who doordashes chipotle and Wingstop daily complains to me that they’re broke…. Some of my coworkers act bewildered by the concept of bringing your lunch to work or making a coffee at home. Not an exaggeration. They will openly talk about how they’re using the last $20 in their account on McDonald’s. 

I’m all for treating yourself and believe that everyone should still be able to enjoy restaurants, vacations, new clothes etc regardless of tax bracket, but it gets to a point.

1ijq5na,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ijq5na,The Star Rewards isn't fair,"

I absolutely hate this Starbucks app now, I have been a loyal member for more than 10 years, just to see 82.61% of my ""Stars"" rewards GONE!!!!!

From 241.4 Stars to 42 current....

All because of the new expiration Stars reward policy, if you don't use your Stars with 6 months, you'll lose them. 

Great example that happened to me.

In 1 month, I spent $143.50 in coffee, which is 143.50 Stars equivalent.

Since it passed the 6-month calendar date, I lost all those rewards in one swoop......


☕️ SUMMARY ☕️

Beware of your Stars and how much your spending in a single month, I advise keeping track of your monthly Stars and set a calendar date alarm before the expiration.

So you can use all your Stars to your full advantage ☕️📚",1,1738915930.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

1ijq3gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TNXP/comments/1ijq3gk/unity_cooperation_victory_time_to_act/,"📢 Unity, Cooperation, Victory – Time to Act 📢","We are not the first retail investors to face market manipulation – but we can be among those who **take action**. This is not about emotions – it’s about facts and evidence.

Together, we can investigate whether TNXP was subject to deliberate market manipulation, gather the necessary materials, and take legal steps. **The more evidence we collect, the stronger our case becomes.**

# 📌 Potential Evidence of TNXP Manipulation

Charts, order books, and transaction data suggest several **potential manipulation schemes** that require further investigation.

# 1. High Trading Volume, No Significant Price Movement

* **Example:** TNXP showed unusually high trading volumes without a proportional price increase or decrease.
* **Is this normal?** Under normal market conditions, high volume leads to price movement. If it doesn’t, possible explanations include:
   * **Wash trading** – Artificial transactions between related parties to inflate trading volume.
   * **Spoofing** – Placing fake orders that are canceled before execution to mislead traders.
   * **Layering** – Creating artificial bid/ask walls to distort supply and demand.

Did this happen with TNXP? We need hard evidence.

# 2. Price Spikes and Drops (December 16-17) – Was Sabby Involved?

* **Example:** TNXP surged rapidly, only to crash just as quickly.
* **Possible manipulation tactics:**
   * **Pump & Dump** – Artificially inflating the price to sell at the peak.
   * **Short Ladder Attack** – Sequential short sales to push the price down.
   * **Spoofing in pre/after-market** – Manipulating the price in low-liquidity hours.

If a fund like **Sabby Management** had open positions during this period, their trades should be examined.

# 3. Pre/After-Market Manipulation (Not Just in December!)

* **Example:** TNXP showed unnatural price movements outside of regular trading hours.
* **Could this involve:**
   * **Marking the close** – Manipulating the price at the end of the session.
   * **Quote stuffing** – Flooding the market with fake orders to disrupt trading algorithms.
   * **Rebate arbitrage** – Artificially inflating activity to exploit exchange rebates.

Did TNXP experience these tactics? More analysis is needed.

# 4. Absurd Price Predictions – Where Did $20 $50 and $90 Come From?

* **Example:** While TNXP was trading **below $1**, some forecasts projected prices of **$20 $50 or even $90**.
* **Key questions:**
   * Who published these forecasts?
   * Were they based on solid financial analysis?
   * Did the authors have a financial interest in spreading them?

Similar misleading forecasts were at the core of **SEC vs. Longfin Corp (2019)**, where stock price projections were manipulated to attract investors.

# 📂 What Evidence Are We Collecting?

To build a strong case, we need **concrete materials**. AI may help. 

✅ **Screenshots of posts from Reddit, Twitter, Discord** – Were TNXP promoters using new accounts? Were they involved in other pump & dump schemes?  
✅ **Analysis of price forecasts** – Who published them? Were they realistic?  
✅ **Order books and transaction history** – Especially from **December 16-17**, but also other suspicious periods.  
✅ **Tracking fund and insider activity** – Did major players sell at the peak?  
✅ **Trade history and market mechanisms** – Did classic manipulation tactics appear?

📌 **Share your findings in the comments – the more analysis, the better.**

# ⚖️ Who Will Find the Right Lawyer?

Finding the right legal team **is crucial**. We need attorneys who:  
🔹 **Work on a success fee basis** – **No upfront payments.**  
🔹 **Are independent of TNXP and Sabby Management** – We must vet their connections.  
🔹 **Have experience in securities fraud and class action lawsuits.**

I’m from Europe and don’t have enough knowledge of the **U.S. legal system** to take on this task. **That’s why we need someone familiar with the process to lead this effort.**

📢 **I encourage lawyers to participate in this thread.** If you have experience with class action lawsuits, drop a comment.

# 📢 Previous Class Action Lawsuits – Retail Investors Can Win

📌 **GameStop (GME) vs. Robinhood (2021)** – Lawsuit over restrictions on GME purchases that affected stock prices.  
📌 **Elon Musk & Dogecoin (2023)** – Musk sued for allegedly manipulating DOGE prices via Twitter.  
📌 **Luckin Coffee (2020)** – Class action after fraudulent financial reports were exposed.  
📌 **Nikola Corporation Fraud Case (2021)** – Market manipulation through false claims about their products.  
📌 **SEC vs. JP Morgan (2021)** – The bank paid **$920 million** in fines for spoofing and market manipulation.

# 💰 What Are We Seeking?

✅ **Reimbursement for investor losses.**  
✅ **Compensation for misleading information.**  
✅ **Legal consequences for those responsible for manipulation.**

# 📢 Time to Act – Collective Research, Collective Results

Our goal is to **uncover the truth and gather evidence**. This may take time, but **every detail matters**.

🔎 **Was TNXP manipulated?**  
🔎 **Who was behind the hype?**  
🔎 **What market manipulation techniques were used?**

📢 **Let’s keep researching. If you notice any signs of other classic stock manipulation tactics (e.g., bear raid, short ladder attack, marking the close, painting the tape, rebate arbitrage), share your findings.**

When I was younger, I had an eating disorder that lasted for 11 years, and when I was nineteen, I became a Christian and it saved my life because it gave me the strength to leave my disorder. But after that, I developed crippling anxiety and had to drop out of school for a year. But then, life happened and my mom made me work full time at a job I hated for the sake of insurance, and I only took one, two or no classes at all. By the summer of 2022 I enrolled at a university, and there I had a lot of firsts in life—such as getting ice cream with friends. Or coffee study sessions with them, and I was almost happy. but then my ex boyfriend started being awful to me, and my friendships became stressed for some reason. But during this time—it wasn’t perfect, and I was exploring what I wanted to do with my life. But then, if you thought that was a bit hard, it gets SO BAD.
In 2023 my dog died. I developed episodes of blindness in class. A loved one of mine died, and I was in the Israel-hamas war when it began as a college student on tour. I witnessed so much death, and I developed insomnia. Then, of course, my cat died. Then my grandmother. 
And in the spring semester of 2024, I was messed up. I had other Christians telling me, 
“You are supposed to be this big Christian! Where is your faith?!” 
And I learned that Christians at this Christian university I was at were speaking badly of me. I went through the worst years of my life, and my best friend (who was a psychology major and a christian) told me
“I hold myself and my friends to high standards, and you don’t meet them”
“I judged you because of your sleep issues after the war, because I could not understand why you couldn’t get yourself back together.”
“I decided that no matter how kind you were to me that because of your sleep issues, I was no longer going to be your friend”
“My biggest problem with you is that you are here”
And she knew everything… 
And I was literally almost exploded just a couple months before that in a rocket attack where 3,000 or 5,000 rockets were shot over us, and I am lucky to be here.
And then—I found out that these episodes of blindness I had are possibly related to mini strokes due to a real heart condition I have been just diagnosed with…

And my life has been hell.

People around me absolutely look down on me because I don’t have my degree. I just wonder deep down if all the judgement and harsh treatment I have had was warranted. In the end, my friends dropped me from the friend group. And no one believed me that this roommate did these things to me.
My other roommate used to question my salvation and told me she talked to others about how my mind was “so undisciplined that she (me) goes blind for seconds at a time” and that, of course was because I did not read scripture enough….

I am struggling to find my footing again. I am struggling to get back up after it all. I am at my last four classes, as I had to drop a few because I was literally almost dying at some points, or was struggling with blindness, and every day there are people around me that think I was or am, just lazy. Unmotivated. As if I have not tried.

There is a friend of mine getting married soon, and she looks down on me the most I feel.
She graduated, she’s getting married. She works at a lab. She got promoted. 
I recently got a job at a hospital helping patients overcome struggles that I have already lived through… and it’s a degree level job and because of my education I made the top 15% to be hired at this place, and because I am “so behind” as people have told me, she looks down on me, and I know it. At her wedding shower recently, she told others in a group when I was being introduced that my job was just “a little extra money for my pocket.” And it sucks….. I countered a life that many never walk out of only for it to be meaningless because I have not met requirements for a piece of paper…..and going back to that roommate in college, she drilled in me this mentality of me not being enough unless I accomplish a lot.. what made her betrayal so bad was the fact that she would cry at times and I would comfort her when I had nothing left to give. At times, I would lay in bed and cry quietly so I wouldn’t disturb her. To make her more comfortable, I would go to bed when she went to bed, and would lay there for hours. Trying to fall asleep… 
Oh, not to mention that the FBI literally had to watch our apartment on Hamas’ day of rage because that is when I came home and I was considered to be an ACTUAL TARGET.
But still… she did that to me.

Still not quite sure whether I'm saved.,"Saying I am terrified is an understatement. I have trouble getting myself to spend large sums of money, even for things as vital as university tuition, due to some severe stressors in my past. Tuition payment season coincided with my type 2 bipolar hitting me with full force and I spiraled into severe depression. Didn't emerge from my house or communicate with anyone for weeks. For the first time in 10 years of attending uni, I missed my tuition payment deadline.

Finally emerged yesterday evening (Feb 6) and paid the tuition 1 hour before the ATM closed. Caught up with my emails today and saw one saying I'd be expelled in March if I didn't pay be Feb 6.

I didn't know yesterday was Feb 6.

They also asked me to inform them of my payment by Feb 6. They didn't say ""we'll expel you if you don't pay and inform us."" They said ""You will be expelled if you don't pay be Feb 6"" and after that they wrote ""inform us by Feb 6."" Didn't inform them by Feb 6, but did inform them today and attach my receipt showing yesterday's date.

So yeah. I can't tell if I have just wrecked my life, and I'm wondering if I should go get very very drunk right now.

They would've told my PI (I'm a PhD student) by today if they'd decided to expel me, I hope. Dunno. The office hasn't replied to my email and my PI hasn't come in to scream at me.

1ijptf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1ijptf3/the_devils_kindness/,The Devil’s Kindness,"They say, the greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn’t exist.

What a fool I was.

Greed—or the wanting of greed—took the best of me. And on my worst day, a stranger knocked at my door.

It was late. The kind of late where the world feels hollow, as if even time had abandoned it. Rain poured relentlessly outside, the wind howling like something unseen was prowling in the dark. I hesitated at first, but pity won over caution. The man’s clothes were soaked through, his thin frame trembling with the cold.

I did what any decent Puerto Rican would do. I let him in.

The moment he stepped inside, the air felt… strange. Thicker. Like the weight of something unseen had entered with him. Still, I pushed the feeling aside, convincing myself I was imagining things. I poured us coffee—dark and strong, the way it should be—and placed some soda crackers on the table, a simple comfort to go with the heat of the drink.

He didn’t touch the coffee. Didn’t reach for the crackers. Just sat there, watching me.

And then, he spoke.

“You are a kind man.”

His voice was smooth, almost musical, but there was something beneath it. A hum, a vibration I could feel in my bones.

“And kindness deserves to be rewarded.”

I should have asked him who he was. I should have asked why he came to my door. But I didn’t. The words felt unnecessary, like I was only meant to listen.

“I have something for you,” he continued. “A gift. You are worthy of it.”

I don’t know why I believed him, but I did. Without question. Without hesitation. His words weren’t just sounds; they were truths, settling into my mind as if they had always belonged there.

“Riches beyond your imagination,” he said. “Wealth beyond your wildest dreams. No more struggle, no more need.”

My heart pounded at the thought. Could it be real? A life without worry, without hunger, without counting every dollar before the month was through?

“And the price?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He smiled.

“Barely a price at all. Something you have no need for. Something that, in the end, will not matter.”

I swallowed, my throat dry despite the steaming coffee before me.

“And what is it?”

His eyes darkened, though the smile never faded.

“Your soul.”

The word lingered in the air like smoke, twisting, curling, suffocating.

If I had known then what I know now, I would have thrown him back into the storm. I would have slammed the door, burned my house to the ground, done anything to rid myself of his presence.

But I was an ignorant man.

And so, I made the deal.

True to his word, the riches came.

They arrived from places I never expected—a winning lottery ticket, an unexpected raise, a generous gift from a family friend, an inheritance from an uncle I had never heard of. Money flowed like water, filling every crack of my once-impoverished life.

I wasted no time.

A new house. A new car. A new everything. I traveled the world, indulging in every pleasure money could buy. I slept with beautiful men and women, tasted forbidden delicacies, drank until my heart was full.

Whoever said money couldn’t buy happiness was a liar.

Because I was happy.

Or so I liked to believe.

But happiness built on excess is fleeting. As the years passed, the vastness of my new home became suffocating. Silence echoed in every room, bouncing off the walls of my self-made palace. The loneliness crept in, slow and insidious, whispering to me in the dark.

So, I found a young lover.

We married. She gave me children.

Was I faithful? I’d like to say I was. But I wasn’t.

I wasn’t a cruel husband. I didn’t yell. I didn’t raise a hand. I simply… wasn’t there. I existed on the outskirts of my own life, present in body but distant in spirit.

And time, as it always does, moved forward. The children grew and left. The wife packed her bags and walked away. The house, once new and gleaming, aged and cracked like everything else I had once cherished.

I was alone again.

It was raining that day.

I had forgotten it had been raining the first time I met him.

In fact, I had forgotten about him entirely.

The knock at the door startled me.

Slow, deliberate.

When I opened it, he was standing there.

Unchanged.

Untouched by time.

Not a single wrinkle, not a single gray hair. The same smooth smile. The same dark eyes.

“It’s time,” he said.

And suddenly, I remembered.

I remembered everything.

I remembered reading a story in the Bible once when I was a child—about a man named Jacob who wrestled with an angel of God.

I don’t know why that story came to mind at that moment, but I knew one thing for certain.

The man standing before me was no angel.

And I was not Jacob.

Maybe it was survival instinct. Maybe it was blind, animal terror. But the moment I saw him standing in my doorway, unchanged, untouched by time, I slammed the door shut.

So hard the whole damn house shook.

My heart pounded in my chest, a rabbit’s drumbeat against my ribs. What had made me do that? What madness had taken hold of me? If he was who I thought he was, what could a closed door possibly do to stop him?

Then I felt it.

A chill deep in my bones.

The house grew darker. Colder.

The air itself seemed to rot, and when I looked at the walls, I swore I saw them decay, black mold spreading like a sickness, the wood beneath splintering and curling inward. The whole house was dying around me.

Panic surged in my veins. Among my many acquisitions over the years, I had bought an old revolver—one said to have belonged to a famous outlaw of the Wild West. I loaded it with trembling hands. A fool’s move, but what else did I have? Here I was, a mortal man about to enter a lethal battle with something beyond my understanding.

And then I heard him.

Laughter.

Mocking, cruel, vibrating in the very air around me.

“I am owed a soul.”

The voice slithered into my ears, deeper into my mind.

“And a soul I will take.”

I spun around. Too slow.

He was faster.

And when I saw him—his true form—I felt my own mind unravel.

Gone was the smooth, well-dressed stranger. In his place stood something monstrous. A thing of blackened flesh and burning eyes. Clawed hands stretched toward me, their tips gleaming like obsidian knives.

I tried to raise my gun.

But I was too late.

His claws ripped across my chest with such force that I was flung backward.

I hit the ground, pain searing through me, my chest burning like hellfire itself. I could smell it—sulfur. The stench of damnation.

I fired blindly.

The revolver’s deafening crack echoed through the house. I must have hit him at least once.

But he didn’t stop.

Didn’t even flinch.

He grabbed me, lifted me off my feet, and tossed me like a child’s ragdoll. My back hit the wall. Blood soaked my shirt. My vision blurred. My body screamed in agony, but I wouldn’t—couldn’t—give in.

I would not surrender my soul so easily.

I charged him.

I don’t know where the strength came from.

Fear, maybe.

Or something deeper.

We clashed, a mortal man wrestling with something ancient, something eternal. I don’t know how long we fought. It felt like an eternity.

And then—

The first rooster crowed.

Morning.

We had been at it all night.

I was exhausted. My limbs were useless. My body broken. I couldn’t fight anymore. I fell to my knees, the last of my strength leaving me. I closed my eyes and waited for the final blow.

But it never came.

I opened my eyes.

He was gone.

I woke up a week later in a hospital bed.

My chest burned. The smell of sulfur clung to my skin.

My children were there, watching over me with worried expressions.

The doctors told them I had been robbed. That an intruder had broken in and attacked me. That I had barely survived.

Better that than the truth.

Because the truth was, I fought the Devil for my soul.

Did I win?

I don’t think so.

The wound on my chest refuses to heal. The stench of sulfur never leaves me. My appetite is gone. My body weakens more with each passing day.

I am a dying man.

I can feel death at my door.

So what good did it do?

What good was my defiance?

Because in the end, the Devil always gets his due.

After multiple hospital visits and tests, doctors say my heart is fine and there’s “nothing wrong.” Based on my symptoms, I think it’s costochondritis.  

The pain flares up when I eat, drink coffee, work out, lie down, or sleep—it’s basically there 24/7 to some degree. It’s frustrating because no one has a solution, and I’m just getting used to it at this point.  

Since costochondritis doesn’t seem to have a real cure, should I just ignore it and live with the pain? Or should I keep pushing for more answers?  

TL;DR:Chest pain (likely costochondritis) won’t go away. Doctors say nothing’s wrong, but it hurts all the time. Should I just live with it or keep trying for solutions?  ",0,1738914117.0,costochondritis,1,0.5,False

things went extreme today when she told me her manager at times address other female employees as darling and baby? oh wtf? what kinda manager in a mnc is that? 

the guy keeps messing up with her, if she has earphones on, he’d yell at her and ask her to remove them. if she steps a nail out of her cubicle to get coffee or to stretch for 5-10 minutes, he’d again yell at her and say “office ghumne ki jgah nahi hai” and shit like that.

1ijppaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1ijppaa/struggling_to_accept_my_decision/,Struggling to accept my decision.,"I broke up with my girlfriend of one year yesterday. She has bpd but said therapy has helped her over come it. Shes doing therapy 4 times a week and started out with twice a week when we met.

I myself struggle from dysthemia, which got diagnosed in a first meeting with a therapist last year.

Im a people pleaser and i cant handle fights very well and will usually apologize for everything and try to end fights as quick as possible by comforting the other person.

  
I love her truly and i think she deserves the world but over the months i started to get unhappy to a point where i coulndt focus on work, didnt meet friends, didnt do what i liked. Partly because of people pleasing and partly because of argments we had. She had terrible relationshps befor me and had packages. One boyfriend had female friends in the gym and shes a very jealous person. Going to the gym with her was very hard because no matter what i did, the chance of us fighting was very present. I did cut of female friends and deleted instagram to show her that theres nothing to worry about. At that point i jsut wanted to be and do everything she wanted.

Gaming was something i didnt want to do anymore because anohter ex of her used to play all week and barely spend time with her and i didnt want her to give that feeling again. At some point i tried to get it back by getting a little playtime in befor work when she was sleeping or even when on free days( i wake up early). The time she woke up i shut down the pc, made coffee and joined her in the morning.

Lately that behaviour raised her suspicion becuase its, understandable, weird to shut down as soon as she wakes up.

In the end those are my faults and im in therapy now. After a few months of ""isolating"" i got depressed (doubledepression) and i accepted i need therapy so i searched for it. I got encouraged to stand my ground.

Arguments often went in a way where i just tried to comfort her. It was hard for me to articulate my feelings to her without beeing afraid of her reaction. For example in the beginning sh said she wants 2 days per week where she want to be alone in her flat. Which i agreed on because i thought its important to have. At some point we stopped that because we moved in together and it felt like she didnt need/want the me time anymore.

Later that year, when i my menatl health got worse i tried to engage a conversation about me wanting a bit of time to myself. Maybe i didnt phrase it right but it ended up in a crying/screaming argument where i backpaddled.

Now when i started the therapy, which she encouraged me to go for, she started to push me to do things again and try to work it out. But at that point i always struggled to be alone since i was worried about, that not beeing the right thing right now. In my mind it wasnt something she wanted, so i struggled. I talked about that alot to my mother and a friend and i often heard that i need to have to ""care for myself"" right now.

Last week i was so exhausted that i, after a therapy session where my therapist said ""i need to stand my ground"", i finally said that ""I dont want to fight everyday"" because the way we are communicating isnt working out. I agree on the fact that discussions are right and that you have to express what you are feeling, but in a way that we listen and try to understand each other.

After i said that she got angry in a way of snappy saying ""alright"" and the discussion ended there.

The next day we continued and it got to apoint where she asked if "" i want to be with her"" and i said "" no, not right now and like it is"" she said the same to me afterwards.

Now the next day we continued and we broke up. 

  
Since then im feeling alot of guilt. I didnt knw where to go and what to do anymore. I was tired all the time, always felt like i had a checklist to follow every day to give her the thing she needs, even thought i couldnt fullfill everything she asks for. Which wasnt much, but i just felt anxious every day to miss something or do something to late. 

Now i feel like i didnt do everything i could, i feel like i gave up to early and i think shes right when she says that i just gave up. She tried to help me as much as i tried to help her(i admit i didnt give as much in the beginning, its jsut true, and i dont feek comfortable making an excuse for that).   
She said i was everything she ever wanted and that i just pulled the rug from under her feet.

I feel so guilty and my it feels like the worst decision i ever made and i try to reason that i had my reasons but its hard.",2,1738913907.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

I told myself I was imagining it—symptoms of stress, lack of sleep, maybe even the onset of some neurological condition. But last night, I saw him.

I was brushing my teeth, staring blankly at my reflection, when something shifted in the mirror. Not a flicker of light. Not my own movement.

A shape. A figure.

Behind me.

I spun around. Nothing. Just my small, cramped bathroom. The shower curtain drawn open. The door half-closed, as I’d left it.

I turned back to the mirror. My reflection was alone.

But I felt him.

Not with my eyes. Not with my ears. But something deep, ancient, primal inside me *knew*.

I didn’t sleep.

This morning, I tested myself. I placed a coin in the middle of my kitchen table. I stared at it for a full minute, committing its position to memory before leaving for work.

When I got home, the coin was gone.

Then, as I closed the fridge, I saw it. Sitting perfectly in the center of my counter. Heads up. Facing me.

I wrote this after trying to go to bed early, waking up, and now finding I can’t sleep. I feel worse than hollow. Lately, I’ve just been getting through the days. I work in a meaningful field, but it’s heavy. A decade of this combined with the world’s general anxiety has left me feeling drained. Most people don’t notice, but it’s crippling. I can’t hang with friends, I just work and sleep. My health isn’t the best. Anxiety is making it impossible to do what I want to do.

For over a year, I had been “dating” a much younger girl, but we were often apart, with her being abroad for half the time. So it really didn’t help loneliness. Eventually, I lost attraction to her. She was always so happy and relaxed, while I’m more serious and dark. Since then, I stopped making any real attempts connections and instead distracted myself by looking at dating apps.

After months, I finally clicked with someone. She was the funniest person I’d met in years, extremely well-read, and hardworking. I started to feel hopeful for the first time in a while, imagining a future where, even if it was difficult, I wouldn’t be alone. She was also incredibly anxious, which made me go into a supportive mode to help her feel comfortable. We spent hours talking on the phone, not wanting to hang up. I made sure to be respectful and planned our date to make it as easy as possible for her.

I suggested a short hike in a large park near her place to drink tea—something low-pressure since she had a show later and I didn’t want her to feel trapped. I gave her an easy way out, letting her know that if it didn’t work, we could try again another time. Last minute, she bailed, saying she was angry due to work issues. I offered to reschedule, and I even proposed a different, simpler option: I’d meet her in her neighborhood, grab coffee to go, and then go home. It would be like casually running into each other. I made sure to tell her I was just there for the coffee so she could bail last minute no problem.

We had been very open with each other about our past relationships, mental health, and what we were looking for. When we finally met, she was even more beautiful than her photos, and we had great conversations. I made her laugh a lot, and everything felt honest. In hindsight, I might have said some things that weren’t what she wanted to hear, but I really thought we had moved beyond “games” because of our openness. I told her I wasn’t looking for anything casual, that I wanted to find someone I could be comfortable with, and from everything she had shared, it seemed like she wanted the same. I also mentioned that at the barber the day before I had told him about her, expressing how funny I thought she was.

At the end of our time together, as we parted, I asked if she wanted another hug, and she eagerly agreed. I told her, ""No pressure, think about it, and if you want, let’s plan a date later."" She said she’d love that, and as we parted, I jokingly said, “The answer can be no, don’t stress.” She laughed and boldly said, “Oh, it’s not going to be.”

I didn’t message her right away, not wanting to seem needy or pushy. The next day, I reached out just to ask how her show went. She replied later. I wrote back but she didn’t respond for a while. When she did, it was during my last meeting of the day. I read her message and was crushed. The whole it’s not you it’s me. She explained that she was still getting over a past relationship and that she didn’t think we were on the same page. I drafted a reply, saying I was nervous too and might have come across wrong, but that I’d love to talk again if she felt like my intentions weren’t clear.

Afterward, I ate junk food and tried to go to bed early to numb the feelings. But I woke up after intense dreams, couldn’t sleep, and checked my phone. She had replied hours earlier, saying she wasn’t in the right space for a relationship, that she had walls up, and that there hadn’t been any “cringe” moments. I thanked her for being honest and asked for clarity since everything had been through text.

She was smart, quick-witted, funny, and had similar values and life goals. We wanted the same things in life—our ideal days, pastimes, and future plans all aligned. I didn’t even see her in a sexual way at first, just imagined us road tripping, hiking, climbing, and chilling in hammocks. Normally, I tend to idealize people without knowing them fully, but this time, I was clear in my communication and made sure to listen actively.

It just sucks. All my siblings are married, all my friends are in relationships, and having kids. I can’t seem to hold down a relationship, and just when I felt like I had something more and I was clearly way off. What’s worse than having no hope is getting a glimmer of it, only to have it go away. Like I know she expressed that it’s her… but the whole it’s me not you is pretty overplayed. In this case it seems,s it’s very much after meeting me I said something that or I looked different to what she wanted.

For context I have dated consistently for most my life. Have lived with a partner, have kept long distance relationships going. I rarely have issues when meeting people in person. I have slept with more than I can count and really am past that phase. I am on good terms with most my past partners, except the one who we thought we would marry and didn’t. Most my friends are women. Like I know i could attract and start a relationship but most often it s me thinking sexually. Here I actually saw more. I am getting tired. Out of shape. And just not happy. I am deeply lonely and friends don’t even come close to filling anything. I am getting to socially anxious that I just have no will to just date folks. After swiping like 10000 times in no exaggeration, this seemed like someone I couldn’t believe I would find.",2,1738912971.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

**To get the requirements out of the way:**

* **Age / Sex**: 28 / M
* **Height / Weight**: 6'1 / 175 lbs
* **Race**: Asian (Chinese)
* **Duration of Complaint**: 5 years
* **Location**: New York
* **Any Existing Relevant Medical Issues**: 
   * Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome \[actually diagnosed\]
   * Severe Insomnia (and disturbed circadian rhythm)
   * Unexplained movement disorder (will get into this further below)
   * Anxiety / Brain Fog / Irritability
   * Very likely have ADHD (indicated / suspected by both primary physician, psychiatrist, and neurologist, but kept forgetting to make follow-up appointments to get the definitive diagnosis....I'm terribly scattered and forgetful)
* **Current Medications / Drugs** (oh boy): This is the main point of the post so please see below. 
* I have also done full check-up, MRI, EEG with no abnormalities other than slightly high blood pressure and low vitamin D. Iron levels were surprisingly higher than normal considering how bad my restless leg syndrome is (not officially diagnosed, but docs suspect some movement disorder). 

\----------------------------------------------------------------

**NOW ON TO THE MAIN POST - MY DRUG USE: I am a high-functioning poly-drug addict working on Wall Street, which involves extremely unpredictable long hours (avg. 60 - 90 hours a week), no protected weekends / vacations, and constant anxiety and stress.** 

I ""abuse"" the following drugs and substances. My doctors do not know about any of my drug use other than Marijuana, Kratom, Gabapentin (prescribed), Clonidine (prescribed), Ropinirole, and OTC antiemetics. 

* **""Adderall""**: Not officially prescribed, so I get through ""street"" means. 15 - 20mg every day orally once in the morning. Been doing this for 5 years now. 
* **Opioids:** 
   * **Kratom**: Started off with like 3 - 5g a night to get myself to sleep...but have moved on to 7OH. Been doing this since 2021 until finding 7OH.
   * **7-Hydroxymitragynine (aka 7OH):** This is an extract of Kratom that is 10x stronger than Morphine but carries no overdose risk whatsoever. However, I am strongly addicted (more euphoric than fentanyl even, though not as good as morphine / oxycodone), taking 60mg+ every day to stave away opioid withdrawals. Been using this for the last year.
   * **Fentanyl (fake OxyContin pills):** These are the infamous M-box blue counterfeits (includes Fent and god knows what else...could be Xylazine, Nitazenes, etc.). I limit myself to 3-4 pills every month, which I snort instead of Kratom or 7-hydroxy for a few days before returning to the former. No OD history thankfully. Been doing this for 3 years now. 
   * **Opium Poppy Tea**: This is more of a treat for myself once or twice a year, as the high lasts much longer than fent and is incomparably more euphoric. 
* **Benzodiazepines:**
   *  ""**Xanax"":** Not officially prescribed, so I get through ""street"" means, which may be adulterated, but I'll go through \~5 - 7 bars each month (so 10 - 14mg) for anxiety attacks (I don't enjoy this drug recreationally). 
   * **Clonazepam:** Was prescribed this, but I find it pretty ineffective, so I rarely use.
* **Ketamine**: I absolutely hate this drug and the way it feels, but have attempted to use it a couple times for depression and whatever else people rave about. 
* **Gabapentin:** Was prescribed a fuckton of these, but I find it only marginally useful for opioid withdrawals and general RLS. 
* **Clonidine**: Was just recently prescribed given ineffectiveness of Gabapentin but haven't used yet
* **Marijuana**: Daily use just to wind down. 
* **Meclizine / Dimenhydrinate**: I am incredibly susceptible to nausea (since childhood), particularly from motion sickness, so I take these multiple times a week
* **Other Occasional Drugs (highly infrequent because I don't enjoy them much):** Ropinirole (was briefly prescribed for RLS but didn't work so stopped), Psilocybin Mushrooms, LSD, Alcohol, DXM, Cocaine, MDMA

\---------------------------------------------------------

**Now I'm here because I have a variety of unusual symptoms that I was hoping you all could shed some light on. Some may have no relation to my drug use, but I'm guessing most do.** 

**\*\*Please note that Restless Leg Syndrome or some other form of movement disorder / circadian rhythm disorder runs through my family\*\***

1. **Absolutely ridiculous levels of Insomnia despite DEADLY levels of sedative use**: Once I stay up past 1AM, my body kicks into superhuman mode...I have *simultaneously* snorted Fentanyl-laced pills (almost an entire pill) + 1.5mg of Xanax + Dimenhydrinate + hard liquor, and **I felt NOTHING and could NOT sleep still**. This is particularly crazy because I could drink coffee in the afternoon at 1PM at work and still doze off immediately, let alone use sedatives. A 0.5mg of Xanax ALONE knocks me out during daytime...but not after 1AM. I am just unbelievably awake, drug-resistant, and hyperactive from the hours of \~2AM - 11AM. Then, I'm exhausted the rest of the day.  
2. **Unrelenting Restless Leg Syndrome (or whatever this curse is)**: Doctors have not been able to diagnose me. Clearly there's complication from the opioid and stimulant abuse, but I would've thought that if I'm on opioids, this would not be an issue unless I'm in withdrawal. However, even with opioids + gabapentin throughout the day, I still have an endless urge to shake my whole body, arms, etc. 
   1. It's not quire involuntary, but staying still feels like my muscles are constantly trying to tense or my skeleton is trying to jump out of my body. 
   2. Interestingly, suddenly ""spazzing out"" like I'm faking a severe seizure stops the discomfort, but immediately resumes as soon as I stop.
   3. There is a sensitive spot on my back at the edge of my trapezius and near my spine (behind my heart), that if massaged, completely removes the RLS while the massage is ongoing.
   4. If I shake my legs for too long while sitting, I'll develop vertigo and nausea. 
   5. Opioids do help me sleep though. The other substances occasionally help SLIGHTLY, but opioids are the ONLY thing that has allowed me to sleep like a regular human being...
3. **Strange Hiccups:** I get them in normal situations (like if I accidentally cough and burp at the same time...often happens after a toke of weed). However, they last constantly, and while I can suppress it, it'll continue coming back non-stop for the next day or two.    
4. **Horrible Motion Sickness:** While this runs through my family to an extent, everything makes me nauseous, particularly motion. Sometimes, even the movement of an elevator can cause it. A yacht / smaller sized boats are out of the question, and I'd rather walk tens of miles rather than taking an Uber or Taxi. 

\---------------------------------------------------

I welcome ANY thoughts, advice, or theories. I kindly ask that you please refrain from recommending that I just go to a doctor / family member and lay out all of this. I do not want my substance use (especially the hard stuff...) on any record for future insurance reasons and other personal reasons, i.e., No one in my life is aware of my SUD, and I would 100% rather die than ever disclose this issue in America's healthcare system.

First off whoever reads all this thank you.. cause i genuinely need advice. And not ""just leave"" advice cause it's never that easy as you know. Let me just straight get into it.
I'm 20 F and met my boyfriend in my junior year of highschool and we have been together for 3 years.
I'm currently in college almost in my junior year, but now being more wise than I was in high-school i genuinely think that I'm drained and just want a new perspective of life. Starting off meeting my bf he immediately wanted to know all about my past in detail, anything l've ever known and where I got it from. For example certain songs or certain clothes that is male oriented he gets skepetical.
Immediately telling him my whole past was my first mistake, it made me feel horrible when he started getting comfortable enough to tell me that it made him feel sick to know about my past. I eventually lied at some point about bits of my past and overtime he realized the stuff I was saying wasn't adding up.
First off I'm not a straight liar, I told a white lie or a lie to protect myself from someone i genuinely fell so hard for but at the same time they made me feel very bad about myself. I cut off all aspects of my social media, deleted my photos because that's what he likes and that's what he's used too. Deleted all my videos on tiktok and even stopped my goal of making money on TikTok after I had blown up and got 1.1mil likes before I met him. I basically let go of who l was. Background about my bf is he never grew up in a normal family is the way I can say it. Unemotional dad and very emotional mom. Long story short he grew up too fast and became a mix of his parents.
Toxic and just overly fragile. Spilled coffee will ruin his whole day. Can't ever clean the litter without getting angry, can't take out his contacts without getting mad about something. Just overly fragile.
While I'm so the opposite. Yes I can get upset at simple things but l'm more of a problem solver while he is the type to just cuss and be angry and let something small ruin his day.
Overtime after the whole white lie incident. And after a million arguments. I came out clean about the lie I told early in the relationship. At that point i was done talking about my past when all he made me feel was shamed.
As time went on and we argued severely in my freshman year of college I started to realize I was severely depressed and drained from this relationship. It showed up in my grades and in my emotionally energy. While I can sit here and say so much more, I was obviously never the perfect person, he always got under my skin and I started to resent him and become so mean anytime we argued. I've explained so many times that the reason we argue so much is because of his approach and his toxic wired brain.
As I'm growing up now I realize I really do love him so much and I'm hoping that one day he will just grow up and change after we hit our 25's and + but some days l'm just so over it. I want freedom to figure out who I am again without having to feel like I'm on egg shells. I just want to experience life in a different perspective. But I know this won't happen anytime soon because he loves me so much he would never ever let me go, and no not in the toxic way like he would be abusive but he would always reach out and cry and beg to me. I really just feel crazy sometimes like maybe I'm so mean and I'm the one who's toxic but the truth is I'm just resentful and tired. 

How do you continue to have so much patience with someone who continuously just pushes your buttons?

Any highschool sweet hearts who started off toxic and just overall immature?

And long lasting relationships? And your experience in it overtime?

Any relationships gone thru this kind of faze?. I know majority are going to say just leave him but I just need more input",2,1738912026.0,Advice,13,1.0,False

# Introduction

Struggling with sleep? You're not alone.

Tossing and turning, waking up groggy, and feeling like a zombie all day is a reality for many. Poor sleep isn’t just about feeling tired—it **wrecks your mood, drains your energy, and messes with your metabolism**.

Even worse, your body **needs deep sleep to produce growth hormone**, which helps with recovery, fat loss, and overall well-being.

This is where [Revive Daily steps in](https://theworldhealth.org/revive-daily-official). It claims to improve **deep sleep quality** and support **natural growth hormone boosters**—but does it actually work? We put it to the test to find out.

# Product Overview

* **Product Name: Revive Daily**
* **Category: Deep Sleep Herbal Remedies**
* **Overall Verdict: 4.8/5**

# What is Revive Daily & How Does It Work?

At its core, **Revive Daily** is a **natural sleep aid supplement** designed to help you **fall asleep faster, sleep deeper, and wake up refreshed**.

Unlike melatonin-heavy alternatives, it uses **herbal sleep support capsules** with amino acids and minerals to encourage **growth hormone levels** naturally.

Key ingredients like **L-Arginine and L-Lysine** stimulate GH release, while **Ashwagandha sleep aid** reduces stress hormones.

**Magnesium and Zinc** help **relax the nervous system**, and **Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)** supports serotonin, which keeps sleep cycles in check.

By addressing multiple **factors affecting sleep**, this supplement **restores a natural rhythm without the groggy side effects of synthetic sleep aids**.

# Ingredients Breakdown & Their Benefits

The formula combines **herbal remedies for deep sleep** with amino acids and minerals to promote **growth hormone levels** and **improve sleep quality**. Here’s how:

* **L-Arginine & L-Lysine benefits** – These amino acids are linked to **natural growth hormone boosters**, helping the body repair and recover overnight.
* **Ashwagandha sleep aid** – A powerful herb that reduces stress and **makes it easier to fall into deep sleep**.
* **Magnesium & Zinc** – These minerals support **relaxation and hormone balance**, making sleep feel more natural.
* **5-HTP** – Boosts serotonin, keeping your **natural sleep cycle on track**.
* **Melatonin-free sleep supplements** – Instead of relying on melatonin, this formula works with the body’s natural hormones to improve rest.

Each ingredient **plays a specific role**, working together to deliver a deeper, [more refreshing sleep](https://theworldhealth.org/revive-daily-official) experience.

# Danny’s Personal Experience with Revive Daily

Danny, my go-to web guy who spends far too many late nights tweaking site designs and fixing bugs, decided to [give Revive Daily a shot](https://theworldhealth.org/revive-daily-official).

Between caffeine-fueled work sessions and an erratic sleep schedule, getting quality rest wasn’t exactly his strong suit. So, I handed him a bottle and told him to report back.

At first, he was skeptical—“Another sleep supplement? Sure, why not.” But after a few nights, something changed. Instead of waking up groggy or hitting snooze a dozen times, he found himself **waking up refreshed** and surprisingly functional before his third cup of coffee.

The **deep sleep quality** felt noticeably different, and by the second week, he mentioned feeling **more alert and less mentally foggy** throughout the day.

His only minor complaint? The capsules are on the larger side, and swallowing four at once felt a little like a mini-challenge. But aside from that, he was genuinely impressed—enough that he’s still taking it weeks later, which is saying something for a guy who usually forgets his multivitamin.

His verdict? **Revive Daily** delivered, helping him get **better sleep without feeling knocked out**—exactly what he needed to keep up with his late-night coding marathons.

She was kind, understanding, and a beautiful soul. We had a million of amazing memories together. I admit, I can be stubborn and say things without thinking.

The issue? I stayed in contact with my ex, G, who has severe depression and suicidal tendencies. I would pick her up from psych wards. I would check up on her to see if she is ok over the phone and text and met her over 5 years probably 10 times for coffee. Our texts were just nonsense and totally goofy. We had 0 feelings for each and I never cheated, and only checked in as a support system. Q found out six weeks ago and ended things, saying she can't trust me anymore. She also said if she will be with me, she would hate herself for it.

I’m heartbroken and want her back. She did not reply to my recent text about being careful in stormy weather. Has anyone been in a similar situation and made it work? I do want to call her but I don’t know how to start, besides the fact that I understand how much pain I caused her. Any advice would mean a lot.",0,1738911241.0,relationship_advice,24,0.3,False

Some observations.....,"Like the title says ""One week free of nightshades"".  Overall Inflammation has dropped leading to smooth hair and skin.  Water bloat midsection fat is tightening up and although I haven't lost weight, the body just feels tighter somehow.

Digestion is a breeze!  My whole life, bathroom visits were ......searching for the right adjective here.....well, they were bad.  Now, they're good!  One or two wipes and I'm out of there.

All gum bleeding has stopped.  This is big.  I've had bleeding gums for ten to fifteen years and have tried everything- Keto, Vegan, Intermittent fasting, gluten free, dairy free, carb backloading, quitting coffee and sugar....that's just off the top of my head.  Dropping nightshades is the only thing that has worked in stopping the gums bleeding.

No more impatient driving and speeding.  I know coffee makes me a road rager, and I quit that a while back.  However driving has reached a new degree of mellow, something I never reached before.

All quirky food allergies have disappeared- I'm drinking black tea with milk in the morning, cashews and pistachios, eggs with sourdough bread, sushi.  I used to have such trouble with food! and my skin was red and.....ugh!  It was awful.  I now wake up excited about what I get to eat trouble free.

Lastly, it has very much been a withdrawal period.  I quit smoking many years ago, but the urge came back full on.  I found myself on days two through four really flatlined and listless.  During those days I wasn't excited about eating.  Some times just after lunch I'd be thinking of eating again.  I caught myself several times realizing it was a hankering for nightshades- ketchup, salsa, potatoes, chilies that was causing this.

I will never go back.  I'm 55 years old and have struggled since I was a boy with bloated stomach, weak muscles, poor digestion, brain fog.  I always knew something was wrong but couldn't place it.  And of course the whole family and girlfriends/ex wife told me to stop worrying that everything was fine.  No!  I was miserable.

1ijp3dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ijp3dh/how_do_i_find_my_passions/,How do I find my passions?,"I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Anthropology and have always been passionate about helping others. I was born with a physical disability called Cerebral Palsy and underwent multiple treatments and surgeries throughout my childhood. My experiences with healthcare inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, and I initially aspired to become a medical doctor. However, as I progressed through college, I realized that the extensive years of schooling and training required to become a physician might not be the right path for me.
Despite this, my desire to work in healthcare remained strong. I discovered that becoming a physician assistant would allow me to pursue a rewarding career in healthcare with a shorter timeline, where I could work alongside doctors and nurses, contributing to patient care as part of a collaborative team. I completed a certified medical assisting program, became a licensed medical assistant, and hoped to gain experience in a clinical or hospital setting.
However, graduating from the program was a struggle for me like blood sweat and tears. I have a lot of criticism towards my instructor and my most recent family members. The physical dexterity and the time constraints were a problem but I still did not want to give up no matter what.  It's been several months since I graduated and obtained my certification, and I’ve struggled to find a job in the field. I believe my disability, which affects my mobility due to Cerebral Palsy, is limiting my job opportunities. My vocational specialist has been working diligently to help me find a position, he believes i have multiple talents and not just one but many of the roles he’s found are outside of the medical field. Best believes to find a healthcare administration position where i can sit at a desk and work or wherever.  I’ve completed projects for a real estate company and filmed a house tour, filmed a promotional video for a coffee company, and attended informational meetings across various industries, but these are not formal interviews or directly aligned with my goal of working as a medical assistant. This agency works towards individuals with disabilities for job placement in small businesses to “ help promote their business” Recently, I attended an informational mee but those projects put a strain on my body. ting for a home health aide company, and I was also connected to a networking event. While these have been helpful, I was connected with about 8 people from the event but it is non medical related.
At the same time, I’ve discovered a passion for content creation. My YouTube channel has grown to 4.89k subscribers, and I’m considering whether to focus on content creation full-time or continue my pursuit of a career in healthcare. I am in the youtube Partnership program.  My brother suggested that instead of complaining or refusing, I should build a profile with the skills sets that I have. He questioned my abilities  on whether I am able to draw blood or accurately measure blood pressure let alone hear it as negative criticism rather than encouragement and had an argument with the whole family. Rather than words of encouragement I hear it as criticism to just look at what is in front of me.  Ex. helping the family laundromat and promo the business. That alone, I don't know either. I feel lost now. I am expected to find 20 small business that run along the work themes of 1) helping others 2) planning/ researching and 3) creativity
A major challenge is that I don’t have a driver’s license, which limits my ability to apply for certain healthcare roles that require commuting. My goal is still to become a physician assistant, but I’m reconsidering whether I should continue down that path, especially given my family’s preference for me to focus on content creation or just not get a job and have fun with life instead of pursuing a traditional job.
Additionally, my undergraduate GPA of 2.8 presents another obstacle if I were to apply to a PA program, and I’m unsure whether my healthcare aspirations are still feasible.
I’m seeking guidance on how to move forward. Should I continue pursuing a healthcare career, focus on growing my YouTube channel, or try to do both? Any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated. I want to throw in the towel and terminate my contract. Yes, my contract has been terminated and I have parted ways with my vocational specialist. But if healthcare is not an option what would be another great option? How do I find what I am passionate about?I thought I had what it takes to be a CMA, but no one is hiring. Then I found a passion for content creation, worked on some projects, and thought I had the skills to get hired—but that didn’t happen either. I kept hearing I needed to “do better” and  to prove myself. I am depressed and cry and can’t sleep every night because of overthinking. Should I reinstate my case in the future?

It’s not like I enjoy it but it has helped me out with situations before. 

Usually if I get angry over some stupid shit I will act out irrationally, break something and scream at the person/people who upset me. I do it a lot, can’t really help it. 

Kind of learned to curb it though, example being the other day I was going to see my friend who works at an office and we were talking about some complicated crap that we dealt with at the clubs last weekend, she invited me to talk about it probs because she thought it would be over quickly and that she could manipulate the conversation to go her way since she’s working.

Long story insanely short - she plays favourites with people and let’s others get away with stuff if they were her friend longer. Stupid right? 

I explained to her I should get a pass since I’ve helped her a lot and didn’t expect reciprocity, but just thought I would get the same share her other friends did but no she blames me for what happened with the group that night because “I sHoULd kNoW BeTteR” 

She let everyone else except for maybe one other person in our group get away with everything and it wasn’t really even my fault. 

We argued about it while literally at her desk and pausing so she could answer calls and after just no chance or break with me at all I shout at her and Im about to slam a coffee cup at the wall. Keep in mind others are there working and they’re just watching in silence but i had to really hold myself from throwing it at the wall. She’s retracting looking at me like I just ruined her life or something, so I just put the coffee cup back down and said some other stuff and cut the friendship off there and then and walked out of the office. 

I’m like sorta pleased with myself only because i would’ve definitely destroyed the cup any other day I was in an argument but it’s just not even worth it dude.

I (20m) was broken up with by my now ex-boyfriend (19m) last Tuesday the 28th. We were together for just over a year and the breakup came out of nowhere, at least for me, and I’ve been doing my best to work through it as it was my first ever relationship and I’ve been trying to focus on myself, figure out who I am  without him etc etc as he thought it was best we go no contact for awhile. We did agree on trying to stay friends afterwards and he even suggested meeting for coffee or something after we had some time apart. The thing I’ve struggled with the most is the reasoning as to why he wanted to break up as when he explained some of it I wasn’t in the best headspace to process everything he was saying and my memory of it all is kinda hazy (my memory has never been great and I think that was a sore spot for him). I am aware I made mistakes in the relationship and he mentioned being on different paths and stuff, but I feel this desire to reach out and ask to talk about what happened and why he decided to do what he did and what went wrong so I can make my peace with it, learn from it, and move on. I know breaking no contact is a terrible idea, but I can’t stop thinking about why it all happened and how he feels about the whole thing now too. Should I wait until he hopefully reaches out himself and work through it until then or hope that he’s understanding of why I need to speak with him sooner and forgive me for breaking no contact ?

The small town of Senoi, Iowa, basked in the golden glow of a bright day. The picturesque church stood tall, its steeple stretching for the heavens. Inside, rows of pews were filled with smiling faces and whispered excitement. At the altar stood TJ, his grin crooked with sardonic charm, dressed in a slightly wrinkled suit that he had argued ""added character."" Across from him, Lily, radiant and seemingly perfect, glowed with happiness as she spoke her vows with a voice trembling with sincerity.

""I promise to love you, TJ, with all that I am. To stand by your side through all of life’s challenges. You gave me hope when I had none, and I vow to return that light to you every day of our lives,"" she said, her words steeped in earnest emotion. Her hands trembled slightly as she held his, her gaze unwavering.

TJ shifted slightly, his discomfort with such raw sentiment barely concealed. A grin tugged at his lips as he leaned forward, muttering just loud enough for Lily to hear, ""Is it too late to switch to 'I promise not to nag?'""

Lily’s soft laugh broke the tension, and she shook her head at him, her cheeks flushing. The crowd chuckled lightly at TJ’s antics, their warmth evident in the murmurs of approval. The priest concluded his blessing with a solemn yet joyful tone. ""You may now kiss the bride.""

As TJ leaned in to kiss Lily, the applause rose to a crescendo. Yet, as their lips met, TJ felt an odd ripple in the air—as though something unseen brushed against him. The room darkened briefly, as if a cloud had passed overhead. He instinctively pulled back, his brows furrowing as he glanced toward the crowd, though everyone else seemed oblivious.

""Cool,"" TJ muttered under his breath as they turned to face the crowd. ""Haunted vows.""

Lily gave his hand a squeeze, her thumb brushing against his palm in a reassuring gesture. ""You’re not funny.""

""Sure I am,"" TJ replied, masking the slight chill running down his spine with humor. ""That’s why you married me.""

The churchyard was alive with celebration as the newlyweds stepped into the sunlight. Folding tables decorated with flowers and lace held trays of hors d’oeuvres, glasses of sparkling cider, and a tiered wedding cake that Lily had insisted on baking herself. Guests mingled beneath strings of fairy lights, the soft hum of laughter and conversation weaving through the air. Children darted between the adults, their giggles blending into the distant chirping of birds.

TJ found himself cornered by his best friend, Mike, who held a paper plate stacked with finger sandwiches and cheese cubes. ""You actually went through with it,"" Mike said, shaking his head with mock disbelief. ""I half-expected you to fake a heart attack at the altar.""

""I considered it,"" TJ replied, plucking a cube of cheddar from Mike’s plate. ""But I figured, why ruin Lily’s big day? She’s already locked into the poor life choice of marrying me.""

""Poor life choice? You’re a catch,"" Mike said, smirking. ""A slightly damaged catch with questionable fashion sense, but a catch nonetheless.""

TJ snorted. ""Thanks, man. I’ll make sure that’s engraved on my tombstone.""

The two men stood in companionable silence for a moment, watching the crowd. Lily moved gracefully through the throng of guests, her laughter ringing out as she hugged family members and old friends. She looked radiant, her white dress catching the golden hues of the late afternoon sun.

""She looks happy,"" Mike said softly, nudging TJ with his elbow. ""You did good, man.""

TJ’s grin faltered slightly as he watched her. ""Yeah,"" he said after a pause. ""She does.""

Mike studied him, his brow furrowing. ""What’s that tone? You’re happy, right?""

TJ forced a smile, running a hand through his hair. ""Of course. Happiest I’ve ever been.""

As the evening progressed, the celebration showed no signs of slowing. Lily’s father, a jovial man with a booming laugh, raised a toast to the couple. ""To TJ and Lily,"" he declared, holding his glass aloft. ""May your life together be as sweet as this cake, as strong as this cider, and as unforgettable as this day.""

The crowd erupted into cheers, and TJ lifted his glass with a lopsided grin. But as he sipped, his eyes drifted toward the tall church windows. The reflection of the string lights shimmered in the glass, casting strange shapes that seemed to shift and writhe.

""Everything okay?"" Lily asked, appearing at his side.

TJ blinked, tearing his gaze away from the windows. ""Yeah. Just tired. Big day and all.""

She smiled, brushing a strand of hair from his forehead. ""It’s the start of forever,"" she said softly. ""And it’s perfect.""

As the last of the guests departed, the churchyard grew quiet. TJ and Lily walked hand in hand back toward the church to collect their belongings. The warm glow of the day had faded into twilight, the air now cool and still.

""It really was a perfect day,"" Lily said, her voice dreamy. ""Don’t you think?""

""Perfect,"" TJ echoed, though a faint unease gnawed at the back of his mind. He glanced over his shoulder at the darkened windows of the church. For a brief moment, he thought he saw movement—a shadow flitting across the glass. He froze, his grip on Lily’s hand tightening.

""Something wrong?"" she asked, turning to follow his gaze.

He shook his head quickly. ""No. Just... this day’s been a lot.""

She smiled, leaning her head against his shoulder. ""Let’s go home,"" she said. ""Our forever starts now.""

PART 2: HOME

The newlyweds moved into their farmhouse later that afternoon. The building was imposing, with an aged charm that hinted at decades of stories it kept locked within its walls. Surrounding the property were endless fields, their golden hues stark against the vivid blue sky. The cicadas hummed incessantly, a background noise that seemed to amplify the oppressive quiet of the house.

""This place has potential,"" TJ said, struggling to lift a heavy box through the threshold. ""Just needs... a little work. You know, duct tape here, maybe a séance there. The usual.""

""It’s perfect,"" Lily said with a smile, her voice warm with optimism. She set a smaller box down on the dusty floor. ""A fresh start.""

The interior of the farmhouse was as charming as it was eerie. High ceilings with exposed wooden beams cast long shadows as the evening sun filtered through the windows. The air inside was stale, carrying the faint scent of old wood and disuse.

As they began unpacking, TJ noticed subtle oddities in the house. A draft brushed past him in the hallway, though no windows were open. The wooden floor creaked beneath his feet, and he swore he heard faint whispers when he stood still for too long.

""Did you hear that?"" he asked Lily as they worked together in the kitchen.

""Hear what?"" she replied, her tone dismissive.

""Nothing. Probably just the house settling."" TJ forced a laugh, but his unease lingered.

They explored the rest of the house, room by room. Each space told a story of neglect and abandonment. The furniture left behind by the previous owners was covered in dust, and the walls bore faint marks of water damage. One room, however, caught TJ’s attention. It was a small, windowless space at the end of the hallway. The door was locked.

""That’s weird,"" TJ said, jiggling the doorknob. ""Why would someone lock a room in their own house?""

""Maybe they kept something valuable in there,"" Lily suggested, already losing interest.

""Or maybe it’s where they kept their haunted dolls,"" TJ muttered, peering through the keyhole. The darkness inside offered no answers.

""Come on,"" Lily called from the living room. ""We have plenty of unpacking to do.""

Reluctantly, TJ left the locked door behind, but the thought of what lay inside gnawed at him. The first night in the farmhouse was anything but restful. TJ lay awake, staring at the ceiling as the sounds of the house seemed to grow louder in the darkness. The creaks of the floorboards, the faint rustling in the walls, and the low hum of the cicadas outside formed a cacophony that refused to be ignored.

Beside him, Lily slept peacefully, her breathing soft and even. TJ envied her ability to drift off so easily. Just as he began to close his eyes, a faint whisper reached his ears.

""TJ...""

He bolted upright, his heart pounding. The room was still. He glanced around, his eyes darting to every corner. ""Lily? Did you say something?""

She stirred slightly but didn’t wake. Swallowing hard, TJ swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood. The wooden floor was cold against his feet as he made his way to the hallway. The whisper came again, faint but distinct.

""TJ...""

He followed the sound to the locked door at the end of the hall. The air around it felt colder, and a faint draft seemed to seep through the cracks. He pressed his ear to the door, his breath shallow.

Nothing.

Shaking his head, TJ returned to bed, but sleep didn’t come easily. The whispers stayed with him, lingering in the back of his mind. The following day, TJ decided to investigate the history of the house. He visited the local library, hoping to find answers. The librarian, a kind but reserved woman named Mrs. Adler, listened attentively as TJ explained his interest.

""This house has been around for decades,"" Mrs. Adler said, pulling out a thick binder of records. ""It’s seen its fair share of owners. Some stayed longer than others.""

TJ flipped through the pages, his unease growing as he read about the house’s past. Stories of unexplained disappearances, tragic accidents, and whispers of hauntings filled the records. One photograph caught his eye: the farmhouse as it appeared fifty years ago. A shadowy figure stood in the doorway, its features obscured.

""That’s... unsettling,"" TJ muttered.

Mrs. Adler gave him a pointed look. ""If you want my advice, you’ll leave that house. Some places are better left alone.""

TJ left the library with more questions than answers. As he drove back to the farmhouse, the sense of unease deepened. Something about the house didn’t feel right, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being watched. Back at the house, Lily greeted him with a smile. ""How was your trip to town?""

""Informative,"" TJ said, forcing a smile. ""This place has a... colorful history.""

""Don’t overthink it,"" Lily said, wrapping her arms around him. ""It’s just a house.""

But TJ wasn’t convinced. That night, as he lay awake once more, the whispers returned. And this time, they sounded closer.

The third day in the farmhouse brought more strange occurrences. TJ found a pile of dead flies on the windowsill in the living room, their tiny bodies forming an unsettling pattern. When he mentioned it to Lily, she shrugged. ""It’s an old house. Probably nothing.""

But TJ wasn’t so sure. He couldn’t ignore the faint scratch marks that appeared on the walls in the hallway, or the way the air seemed heavier near the locked room. Desperate for answers, he called his friend Mike.

""Mike, you’ve got to come see this place,"" TJ said over the phone. ""Something’s... off.""

""Off how?"" Mike asked, his tone skeptical.

""It’s hard to explain. But I feel like... like I’m not alone here.""

""TJ, it’s an old farmhouse. They creak, they groan. It’s probably nothing.""

But even as Mike dismissed his concerns, TJ couldn’t shake the feeling that the house was watching him. That night, TJ awoke to the sound of footsteps. He sat up in bed, his heart racing. The sound was faint but deliberate, like someone pacing in the hallway. He glanced at Lily, who was still fast asleep.

Grabbing a flashlight, TJ crept out of the bedroom and into the hallway. The footsteps stopped abruptly, leaving an eerie silence in their wake. TJ shone the flashlight down the corridor, the beam illuminating the locked door at the end.

The doorknob rattled. TJ froze, his breath caught in his throat. For a moment, he considered waking Lily, but something told him she wouldn’t hear what he was hearing. Summoning his courage, he approached the door. The rattling stopped as he drew near.

""Who’s there?"" TJ whispered, his voice barely audible.

There was no answer. He reached out and touched the doorknob. It was ice cold. That night, he couldn’t sleep. Something was in the house, and it wasn’t leaving. The following morning, TJ decided he needed to get into the locked room. He rummaged through the garage, searching for tools, and eventually found an old crowbar. With Lily busy tending to the garden, TJ returned to the hallway and wedged the crowbar into the doorframe.

The door groaned in protest before finally giving way. The room beyond was dark and stifling, the air thick with dust. TJ stepped inside, his flashlight cutting through the gloom. The walls were lined with shelves, each one filled with old books, jars of strange substances, and faded photographs.

In the center of the room sat a table. On it was a leather-bound journal and a small box. TJ opened the box first, revealing a collection of trinkets—rings, necklaces, and coins—all inscribed with the same symbol as the medallion he had found. He turned his attention to the journal. The pages were brittle, but the handwriting was clear. It belonged to a man named Elias Harper, who had lived in the house over a century ago. The entries grew darker as TJ read on, detailing Elias’s descent into paranoia and fear.

""The whispers grow louder each night,"" one entry read. ""She watches me, even when she’s not there.""

The final entry sent a chill down TJ’s spine: ""I’ve sealed the room, but it won’t stop her. Nothing will."" TJ left the room in a daze, clutching the journal. As he stepped into the hallway, he felt the air shift, colder than before. The faint sound of laughter echoed from somewhere deep within the house.

""Lily?"" he called out, but there was no response. His grip tightened on the journal as a shadow darted across the far wall. For the first time since moving in, TJ realized he wasn’t just imagining things. Something was here, and it was watching. His heart raced as the laughter echoed again, this time louder, as if mocking his every move. He turned sharply, the journal slipping from his grasp and hitting the floor with a dull thud. Shadows seemed to ripple along the walls, converging and dispersing like living things.

The cold silence that followed was suffocating. TJ backed away from the locked room, shutting the door behind him, but he knew it wouldn’t stop whatever was lurking in the house. Clutching the journal to his chest, he resolved to uncover the truth, no matter the cost. As he stepped into the living room, Lily appeared at the edge of the hallway, her expression calm yet unreadable. ""Find anything interesting?"" she asked, her voice carrying an unsettling undertone. TJ hesitated before answering. ""Yeah,"" he replied, his voice steady but his eyes fixed on hers. ""Just some old things."" But deep down, he knew this was just the beginning of a far darker mystery.

PART 3: DISCORVERY

The farmhouse stood silent, shrouded in an unnatural stillness, as TJ sat in the living room clutching the leather-bound journal he had found. The air felt heavy, charged with a tension he couldn’t name. Across the room, Lily hummed softly, busying herself with tidying up the kitchen. Her calm demeanor only amplified TJ’s unease.

He flipped through the brittle pages again, his eyes skimming over the erratic scrawls of Elias Harper, a man who had lived in the house over a century ago. Elias wrote of strange occurrences, whispers in the dark, and a figure he could never quite see but always felt watching him.

""What’s that?"" Lily’s voice broke through TJ’s thoughts. He startled, slamming the journal shut.

""Just... some old junk I found,"" he said, slipping the book behind him. ""Figured it might be interesting.""

Lily tilted her head, her expression unreadable. ""You’ve been acting strange since we moved in.""

TJ forced a smile. ""It’s the house. You know me—big city guy stuck in a creaky old farmhouse. I’m probably just imagining things.""

She stared at him for a moment longer before turning back to the sink. TJ exhaled, relief mingling with the gnawing sense that she didn’t entirely believe him.

The next morning, TJ returned to the local library. Mrs. Adler greeted him with a knowing look as he approached her desk.

""Back again?"" she asked, her tone laced with curiosity.

""Yeah,"" TJ said, placing the journal on the counter. ""This belonged to someone who used to live in the house. Elias Harper. Do you know anything about him?""

Mrs. Adler’s eyes widened as she examined the journal. ""Elias Harper,"" she murmured. ""He was one of the first owners. The stories about him... well, they’re not for the faint of heart.""

TJ leaned in. ""What kind of stories?""

Mrs. Adler hesitated, then gestured for him to follow her to a back room. The dimly lit space smelled of old paper and mildew. She pulled a dusty file from a cabinet and spread its contents on a nearby table. Newspaper clippings, faded photographs, and handwritten notes painted a grim picture.

""Elias Harper was a farmer,"" Mrs. Adler began. ""He moved here with his wife, Lillian. At first, everything seemed fine, but after a few years, neighbors noticed he had become reclusive. He stopped attending church, rarely came to town. Then his wife disappeared.""

""Disappeared?"" TJ asked, his pulse quickening.

Mrs. Adler nodded. ""He claimed she left him, but no one ever saw her again. Shortly after, Elias started talking about... things in the house. Whispers, shadows. People thought he was losing his mind.""

TJ flipped through the clippings, stopping at one with a photograph of Elias standing in front of the farmhouse. Beside him was a woman with piercing eyes and a serene smile. ""Is this Lillian?""

Mrs. Adler glanced at the photo and nodded. ""That’s her.""

TJ’s chest tightened. The resemblance to Lily was uncanny.

That night, TJ couldn’t sleep. The journal sat on the nightstand, its presence a reminder of the questions he couldn’t shake. Beside him, Lily slept soundly, her breathing soft and even. TJ envied her serenity.

Around midnight, the whispers began again.

""TJ...""

He bolted upright, his heart pounding. The room was dark, the only light coming from the faint glow of the moon through the curtains. He scanned the room, but nothing seemed out of place.

""TJ...""

The sound was closer this time, almost as if it were inside the room. Swallowing hard, TJ grabbed the flashlight from his nightstand and crept out of bed. He followed the sound to the hallway, his steps slow and deliberate. The locked room at the end of the hall seemed to hum with an energy he couldn’t explain.

As he approached, the whispers stopped. The air grew colder, and a shadow darted across the crack beneath the door. TJ froze, his breath hitching. Summoning his courage, he reached for the doorknob. It didn’t rattle this time, but it was colder than ice.

""What’s in there?"" he whispered to himself.

The silence that followed was deafening.

The following day, TJ called Mike. ""You need to come over,"" he said, his voice tense.

""TJ, what’s going on?"" Mike asked, concern lacing his tone.

""I can’t explain it over the phone. Just... please. I need someone to see this place.""

Mike hesitated but eventually agreed. ""I’ll be there tomorrow.""

Feeling a small measure of relief, TJ decided to spend the day digging deeper into Elias Harper’s life. He returned to the room, where he had first found the journal. Among the boxes of old belongings, he discovered more photographs and letters. One letter, written in shaky handwriting, caught his attention.

""To whoever finds this,"" it began, ""you must leave this house. She is not what she seems. She will not let you go.""

The letter ended abruptly, the ink smeared as if the writer had been interrupted. TJ’s hands trembled as he placed the letter back in the box. He had hoped for answers, but all he found were more questions.

When Mike arrived the next morning, TJ wasted no time showing him the journal, the photographs, and the letter. Mike listened intently, his usual skepticism replaced by genuine concern.

""This is... a lot,"" Mike admitted. ""But are you sure you’re not just overthinking things? Old houses are creepy. They make noises.""

TJ shook his head. ""It’s not just the noises. It’s the whispers, the locked room, the way Lily’s been acting.""

""What do you mean?""

""She’s... different,"" TJ said. ""She shrugs everything off like it’s nothing, but sometimes I catch her staring at me, like she’s waiting for something.""

Mike frowned. ""Have you talked to her about this?""

""She won’t listen,"" TJ said, his frustration boiling over. ""She loves this house. She thinks I’m being paranoid.""

Mike placed a hand on TJ’s shoulder. ""Alright. Let’s take a look at this locked room.""

The two men stood in front of the door, the crowbar TJ had used to break it open resting against the wall. The room beyond was as TJ had left it—dusty, cluttered, and filled with relics of the past.

""This is it,"" TJ said, gesturing to the shelves and the table. ""This is where I found the journal.""

Mike walked around the room, his eyes scanning the shelves. ""These symbols,"" he said, pointing to the trinkets, ""they look familiar.""

""Familiar how?"" TJ asked.

Mike hesitated. ""I’ve seen them in books about folklore. They’re usually associated with protection or curses.""

TJ’s stomach sank. ""So which is it? Protection or curse?""

""I don’t know,"" Mike admitted. ""But whatever it is, it’s not good.""

As they spoke, the temperature in the room dropped sharply. The shadows on the walls seemed to stretch and writhe, forming shapes that made TJ’s blood run cold.

""We need to leave,"" Mike said, his voice barely above a whisper.

TJ nodded, but as they turned to go, the door slammed shut. The sound reverberated through the room, shaking the shelves and sending a jar crashing to the floor. The two men froze, their breaths visible in the frigid air.

""Did you see that?"" TJ whispered.

Mike nodded, his face pale. ""We’re not alone.""

When they finally managed to leave the room, TJ and Mike sat in the living room, their nerves frayed. Lily entered, her expression calm yet curious.

""What’s going on?"" she asked, her gaze flicking between the two men.

""Nothing,"" TJ said quickly. ""Just catching up.""

Lily raised an eyebrow but said nothing. As she walked away, Mike leaned closer to TJ. ""You need to get out of here,"" he said. ""This house isn’t safe.""

""I can’t,"" TJ said. ""Not without Lily.""

Mike sighed. ""Then you need to figure out what’s really going on. Before it’s too late.""

That night, TJ sat alone in the living room, the journal open on his lap. The words of Elias Harper echoed in his mind: ""She is not what she seems. She will not let you go.""

The faint sound of laughter drifted through the house, its tone cold and mocking. It seemed to echo from every corner, growing louder with each passing second. TJ snapped the journal shut, his hands trembling, as he forced himself to stand. This house wasn’t just haunted by memories—it was alive, and it wanted something from him.

As the laughter faded into an oppressive silence, TJ turned to the hallway. Shadows flickered unnaturally, and he could feel the house watching, waiting. Clutching the journal tightly, he resolved to find out what had happened to Elias Harper and his wife, Lillian. But more than that, he needed to uncover the truth about Lily. As her voice called softly from the kitchen, ""TJ? Are you alright?"" he hesitated, his heart pounding. He wasn’t sure anymore if she was his salvation or part of the darkness threatening to consume him.

PART 4: REVEALATION

TJ didn’t sleep the night after his discovery. The journal's frantic scrawls and the cryptic letter haunted his thoughts, their implications burrowing into his mind like splinters. The words ""She is not what she seems"" replayed over and over as he sat at the kitchen table, staring at the medallion and the photograph of Elias Harper and Lillian. The resemblance between Lillian and Lily was undeniable, a puzzle piece that didn’t fit but couldn’t be ignored.

By morning, TJ had resolved to take Mrs. Adler’s advice and seek out Professor Lewis in Cedar Rapids. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was running out of time, and the house’s oppressive atmosphere seemed to grow heavier with each passing day. Lily didn’t question his sudden need to leave, simply kissing him goodbye as he climbed into the car. Her calm acceptance unnerved him. It was as if she already knew where he was going.

Professor Lewis’s office was exactly what TJ expected: cluttered, dimly lit, and filled with the smell of aged paper and incense. The professor himself was a wiry man with silver-rimmed glasses and an intense gaze that seemed to see straight through TJ.

""You must be Mr. Carver,"" Lewis said, gesturing for him to sit. ""Mrs. Adler called ahead. She said you have something unusual.""

TJ placed the journal, the medallion, and the photograph on the desk. ""I need to know what these mean,"" he said, his voice tight with urgency.

Lewis studied the items in silence, his brow furrowing as he flipped through the journal. When he reached the final entry, he set the book down and adjusted his glasses. ""This is... troubling.""

""No kidding,"" TJ muttered. ""Who was Elias Harper? And why does his wife look exactly like mine?""

Lewis leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. ""Elias Harper was a farmer, yes, but also a recluse in his later years. The stories about him are grim. Whispers of madness, occult practices, and a wife who vanished under mysterious circumstances. But what you’re dealing with..."" He tapped the medallion. ""This symbol is ancient, tied to folklore about Lilith.""

""Lilith?"" TJ repeated, the name unfamiliar.

""The first wife of Adam,"" Lewis explained. ""A demon cast out of Eden, said to prey on men and children. In some stories, she’s described as a seductress, in others, as a vengeful spirit. Always, though, she’s eternal.""

TJ’s stomach turned. ""Are you saying Lily is... what? Possessed? A reincarnation?""

Lewis hesitated. ""I’m saying she may not be what she seems. If this house has drawn her here, it’s not by coincidence. Lilith thrives on despair, on those who cling to their grief.""

""That’s insane,"" TJ said, though the words rang hollow. He thought of Lily’s distant stares, her eerie calm, and the way the house seemed to bend around her presence.

""You came to me for answers,"" Lewis said sharply. ""If you want my advice, leave. Burn the house if you must, but do not stay.""

TJ sat in stunned silence. ""And Lily?""

Lewis’s gaze softened. ""If she’s tied to this, then she won’t leave willingly.""

The drive back to the farmhouse was suffocating. Every mile felt heavier, the weight of the professor’s words pressing down on TJ’s chest. By the time he pulled into the driveway, the sun had dipped below the horizon, and the house loomed in shadow, its windows dark and unwelcoming.

Lily greeted him at the door with her usual smile. ""How was your trip?""

""Informative,"" TJ said, forcing a neutral tone. ""I found some things that might help.""

She tilted her head, studying him. ""You’ve been so tense lately. Why don’t we sit down, have some tea?""

""Maybe later,"" TJ said, brushing past her. He needed time to think, to figure out his next move. But as he climbed the stairs to their bedroom, he felt her gaze lingering on his back, heavier than ever.

That night, TJ didn’t dare sleep. He sat in the living room, the medallion clutched in one hand and the journal open on the coffee table. The shadows seemed to stretch and crawl along the walls, and the whispers were louder than ever, an incessant chorus that gnawed at his sanity.

""Why are you here?"" he muttered under his breath. ""What do you want?""

The room answered with silence, but a faint laugh echoed from the hallway. TJ stood, his muscles taut, and turned toward the sound. The hallway was empty, but the door to the locked room was ajar.

He approached cautiously, the medallion feeling heavier in his hand. Pushing the door open, he found the room exactly as he had left it—dusty shelves, jars of strange substances, and the table with the small box. But this time, there was something else. In the center of the room, a faint figure flickered, its form hazy and indistinct.

""Lillian?"" TJ whispered, his voice trembling.

The figure didn’t respond, but its head tilted slightly, as if acknowledging him. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, it vanished, leaving only the oppressive silence behind.

The next morning, TJ confronted Lily. He waited until they were seated at the kitchen table, the journal and medallion between them.

""We need to talk,"" he said, his voice firm.

Lily looked up from her tea, her expression calm. ""About what?""

""About the house. About you,"" TJ said. ""This isn’t normal, Lily. The whispers, the locked room, the things I’ve found. And then there’s this."" He pointed to the photograph of Lillian.

She studied the image for a long moment before meeting his gaze. ""You think I’m her?""

""I don’t know what to think,"" TJ admitted. ""But something is wrong here, and I need you to be honest with me.""

Lily sighed, setting her cup down. ""TJ, I love you, but you’ve been spiraling since we moved here. Maybe this house isn’t the problem. Maybe it’s you.""

Her words stung, but TJ refused to back down. ""I’m not imagining this. I spoke to a professor who said—""

""A professor?"" Lily interrupted, her voice rising. ""You’ve been running around talking to strangers about our lives instead of coming to me?""

TJ slammed his hand on the table, the medallion clinking against the wood. ""Because I don’t know if I can trust you!""

The silence that followed was deafening. Lily’s expression hardened, her serene facade cracking. Without a word, she stood and walked out of the room, leaving TJ alone with his doubts.

That evening, TJ received a text from Mike: ""Call me when you can. Found something you’ll want to see.""

He dialed immediately, his heart pounding. ""What is it?""

""I was digging through some old archives,"" Mike said. ""There are more stories about your house. It’s not just Elias and Lillian. There’s a pattern. Every couple that’s lived there—something’s happened to them. Disappearances, deaths, madness.""

TJ’s grip tightened on the phone. ""And the wives?""

""Always the same description,"" Mike said. ""Dark hair, pale skin, piercing eyes. TJ... it’s Lily.""

The call ended abruptly as the lights in the house flickered. TJ turned slowly, the phone slipping from his grasp. Lily stood in the doorway, her silhouette framed by the dim light.

""Who were you talking to?"" she asked, her voice low.

""No one,"" TJ lied, his pulse racing. ""Just a work call.""

She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. ""You’ve been so distracted lately. You should rest.""

As she left, TJ sank into a chair, his mind racing. He couldn’t stay here, but he couldn’t leave without answers.

That night, TJ packed a bag. He didn’t know where he would go, but he needed to get out. As he descended the stairs, the whispers returned, louder than ever. They seemed to come from all around him, overlapping and incomprehensible.

When he reached the front door, Lily was waiting for him. Her calm smile sent a chill down his spine.

""Going somewhere?"" she asked.

""I need some air,"" TJ said, his voice shaking.

She stepped closer, her eyes locking onto his. ""You’re not leaving, TJ. Not yet.""

For the first time, TJ saw something in her gaze that wasn’t human. He took a step back, his hand tightening around the medallion. ""What are you?""

The house seemed to come alive around him, the walls groaning and the shadows growing darker. As TJ bolted for the back door, Lily’s laughter echoed behind him, cold and mocking. He didn’t stop running until he was in the middle of the field, the farmhouse a dark silhouette against the night sky.

He clutched the medallion to his chest, his breath ragged. He wasn’t safe, not yet. But he knew one thing for certain—he had to end this. Whatever Lily was, whatever the house wanted, he wouldn’t let it take him.",4,1738910061.0,HFY,2,0.75,False

We were together for just over a year and the breakup came out of nowhere, at least for me, and I’ve been doing my best to work through it as it was my first ever relationship and I’ve been trying to focus on myself, figure out who I am  without him etc etc as he thought it was best we go no contact for awhile. We did agree on trying to stay friends afterwards and he even suggested meeting for coffee or something after we had some time apart. The thing I’ve struggled with the most is the reasoning as to why he wanted to break up as when he explained some of it I wasn’t in the best headspace to process everything he was saying and my memory of it all is kinda hazy (my memory has never been great and I think that was a sore spot for him). I am aware I made mistakes in the relationship and he mentioned being on different paths and stuff, but I feel this desire to reach out and ask to talk about what happened and why he decided to do what he did and what went wrong so I can make my peace with it, learn from it, and move on. I know breaking no contact is a terrible idea, but I can’t stop thinking about why it all happened and how he feels about the whole thing now too. Should I wait until he hopefully reaches out himself and work through it until then or hope that he’s understanding of why I need to speak with him sooner and forgive me for breaking no contact ?  This is my first post so plz forgive if it’s not the best 🙏🏻",4,1738910013.0,askgaybros,5,1.0,False
1ijorxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1ijorxx/review_lancôme_idole_power/,Review: Lancôme Idole Power,"This is a review of the newest Lancôme perfume, Idole power. I bought a full size version of this for $155 and have used it regularly since then. 

If this review looks familiar to you, it’s because I expanded a comment I made here in the SOTD thread a few weeks ago into an actual review of this perfume. 

I am completely obsessed with Lancôme Idole Power. The notes are Sandalwood, Pomarose, and Damascena Rose.

One thing to note- this particular perfume is the first ever that I have actively sought out after getting a sample. It lived rent free in my head for a few days and I had to have it . Im 34 and have has so many perfumes but have generally just blind-bought whichever I saw had high ratings. I didn’t really care until this one.

Below are my thoughts.

I got the sample from my makeup artist at the Lancôme counter in my shopping bag, and just casually sprayed it before my evening activities. I instantly perked up and became hyper aware of all the different things happening within this fragrance. It is a very unique and beautiful smell.  The more I went through my evening, it kept getting better and better. It makes me feel warm, curious, and satisfied. It “smells expensive” too. It smells like “being intentional” too, and what I mean by that is due to the dynamic parts of the fragrance, it makes me feel like I made the right decision (any decision, for whatever) and the scent reminds me of accomplishment.

The next part is what made me end up buying it to begin with

The Next day after the samples, I put my jacket on from the day before and the fragrance was still there and I got just lost in it all over again.

I cannot believe how long it lasts. People say perfumes don’t last more than 8 hours, except for the fact that I spray this on myself and can still smell it in my hair all through the next day. I love how long it lasts, and that I randomly get wifts of it throughout the day. 

I am a competitive partner dancer which means I must either not wear a scent, or choose one that isn’t too overwhelming. This fragrance checks that box, while still being pleasant and interesting. It doesn’t smell masculine, it’s definitely a feminine fragrance, but the sandalwood being part of it does draw it a little into a more neutral territory which I believe contributes to the scent being so dynamic and interesting.

I believe this “dynamic” feature of the fragrance is due to the sandalwood addition balancing out the floral and fruity bits of the pomarose , and the additional floral from the damascena rose. All of this makes it a pleasantly robust scent without being “too much”

there’s mental stimulation involved with this fragrance too because the smell is so unique and multi-faceted that you are actively engaged with it anytime you get a whiff. If I were to break it down into parts, I’d do it as follows:

Sandalwood: 1 wood

Pomarose: .5 of fruit-candy-sweet / 1 floral

Damascena rose: 1 floral

So then the total notes would be 2 floral, 1 wood, with a .5 of sweet/fruit/candy. It’s just a beautiful, perfect blend. It’s truly incredible.

It makes me feel like I’m immediately more luxurious, exquisite, and that I have a good sense of self, because I have been thoughtful in my fragrance. I’m in Portland, it’s been very cold and rainy here lately, so the warm woodiness off the sandalwood is fun to experience when it’s wet and dreary. It enhances the already lovely smell of the rain.

I have also never gotten so many comments on a perfume. The gal standing outside my car taking my order at the coffee drive though said I smelled good, my mom told me I smelled good, a random lady I interacted with at Nordstrom told me I smelled good.. people LOVE this fragrance lol. 

I also think it would be a really good fit for a date night, because of how interesting it is, it would give you an air of mystery 😂

The closest fragrance I own to this would be Tiffany &love - also a woody fragrance so if you like that perfume, you  will almost certainly like this one. 

Thanks for reading this if you made it this far.. I hope you get a chance to try this lovely perfume. I am so glad to be able to share all of my thoughts with people who will care and appreciate!",2,1738909881.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

I am a 19 year old female and am seeking advice on how I can handle or get over some past issues I had with my mom. 

Little backstory, my mom and my dad separated when I was 11 years old. I have an older brother and a twin sister who has a downsyndrome. 

When i was 12 years old my mom started seeing this new guy ( let’s call him B) , being so young I wasn’t too thrilled of the idea. But I sucked it up and I was happy for my mom. My mom is bipolar, and during the separation she was super depressed, I didn’t know it at the time as I was so young and she always took care of us and I wouldn’t have had a clue. 

After about 6-7 months I believe, B moved in with us. He smoked weed and cigarette, my mom also started to smoke weed and cigs. They would smoke all the time and drink quite often. When they would drink they would get into really bad arguments, and I mean really bad. I would hear them yelling on the top of their lungs, B would punch holes in walls and doors, he would throw stuff around. One time I heard them yelling and he broke a glass coffee table we had and I heard it shatter. This was almost an every night thing, I would wake up to them yelling, I would listen and cry. Sometimes I would video it and just sit by my bedroom door bawling. And I should say he would never ever hurt my mom, he would only punch objects and such. 

A lot of the times I would text my mom asking them to please be quiet or to go outside. This usually wouldn’t do anything but I really did try. Every morning I would wake up and go downstairs and see stuff broken, stuff thrown around, empty alcohol bottles. I would always clean it up because I couldn’t stand seeing it. Usually B and my mom would sleep late into the day so I was taking care of my sister as she isn’t capable of doing it by herself due to her disability. Usually when they would fight we wouldn’t go to school the next day because we were up late hearing them or my mom wouldn’t be awake. My mom would sometimes sleep all the wag until 3pm, clearly she was going through some mental health issues but this had a big toll on me as well. I also want to say this because I feel like it’s important, my mom did this hypnosis cleansing thing to stop smoking, basically she got “drugged” and she would see this imaginary mother spirit that would give her advice, and it told her that she needs to spend more time with me.  Sorry that’s a really bad explanation but I really don’t know much about it other than the fact that she got hypnotized and some thing gives her advice lol! 

This happened all the way until the age of about 15-16. I never felt close with my mom, I mean of course I loved her but we never really hung out or did stuff together. I moved out when I was 17 into my dad’s house and moved out of my dads when I was 18. My mom had stopped drinking about two years ago and B had also recently stopped drinking. I don’t think they fight anymore I think that’s all over with, my mom’s metal health is also significantly better. My mom and I are super super close now, I mean we are bestfriends we FaceTime almost everyday, we always do stuff together. I go to her house a lot we talk allll the time. And I should mention I’m also good with my step dad now I see him as a fatherly figure. 

But I just feel like I never really got to talk about what happened when I was 13-16 I don’t really want to call it trauma because I feel there’s so much worse situations that other people of been it, I don’t really think I can consider it that. It feels  almost like an unresolved issue and I cant get over it, I don’t really want to talk to my mom about it because she is a great mother and I don’t want her to feel bad. So I’m just wondering what can I do? An advice would be really really appreciated!",1,1738909458.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
