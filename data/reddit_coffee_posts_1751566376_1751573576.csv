1lqziju,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1lqziju/can_you_use_patio_furniture_indoors/,Can you use patio furniture indoors?,"So I've been getting this question a lot lately, and honestly, I used to wonder the same thing myself. Can you actually use patio furniture indoors? The short answer is absolutely yes, and I'm here to tell you why it might be one of the best decorating decisions you ever make.

I started thinking about this whole indoor patio furniture thing when I moved into my current apartment. The living room was huge but oddly shaped, and traditional indoor furniture just looked weird in the space. Plus, I was on a tight budget and needed something that could handle my lifestyle (read: I'm not the most careful person with my stuff).

That's when I discovered that patio furniture indoors is actually a genius move for so many reasons. First off, it's built to last. Think about it – this stuff is designed to survive rain, snow, UV rays, and everything else Mother Nature throws at it. Your living room is going to be a walk in the park compared to that.

The durability factor is huge, especially if you have kids or pets. My friend Sarah has two Golden Retrievers and a toddler, and her outdoor furniture in the family room still looks brand new after two years. Try that with a regular fabric sofa and you'll be shopping for a new one in six months.

Another thing I love about using patio furniture indoors is how easy it is to clean. Most outdoor pieces are made with materials like powder-coated aluminum, resin wicker, or weather-resistant fabrics. Spilled wine? No problem. Muddy paw prints? Wipe it right off. It's seriously life-changing when you don't have to stress about every little mess.

The style options these days are incredible too. Gone are the days when outdoor furniture meant cheap plastic chairs and flimsy tables. Now you can find [patio furniture sets](https://athometouch.com/patio-furniture-set) that look just as sophisticated as high-end indoor pieces, but at a fraction of the cost.

I've used outdoor dining sets in my dining room, and guests never even realize it's ""patio furniture"" until I tell them. The designs are sleek, modern, and honestly more interesting than a lot of traditional indoor options. Plus, you can mix and match pieces more easily since everything is designed to work together.

One concern people always bring up is comfort. I get it – you're probably thinking about those hard plastic chairs from your childhood. But modern outdoor furniture is designed with comfort in mind. There are outdoor sofas with thick cushions, ergonomic dining chairs, and even outdoor recliners that are more comfortable than some indoor furniture I've sat on.

The weather-resistant cushions are actually pretty great indoors too. They're designed to resist fading, moisture, and wear, which means they'll keep looking good way longer than regular indoor cushions. And if you do need to replace them eventually, outdoor cushions are usually way cheaper than custom indoor ones.

Here's something else I discovered – outdoor furniture is perfect for people who like to rearrange their space frequently. Since it's lightweight and durable, you can move pieces around without worrying about scratching floors or damaging the furniture. I've rearranged my living room like six times this year, and everything still looks perfect.

The versatility is amazing too. During nice weather, I can actually move some pieces outside for parties or just to switch things up. Try doing that with your regular indoor sofa – not happening. This flexibility is especially great if you have a small space or like to entertain both indoors and outdoors.

Budget-wise, using patio furniture indoors is a no-brainer. You can get a complete living room or dining room set for what you'd pay for just one piece of comparable indoor furniture. I furnished my entire living room with a beautiful outdoor sectional, coffee table, and side tables for less than what I was quoted for just a regular indoor sofa.

Now, there are a few things to keep in mind. Not all outdoor furniture works well indoors – you want to avoid anything that looks too obviously ""outdoorsy"" if that's not your style. Stick to pieces with clean lines and neutral colors that complement your indoor decor.

Also, consider the scale of your space. Some outdoor furniture is designed for large patios and might overwhelm a smaller indoor room. But there are plenty of [patio furniture sets](https://athometouch.com/patio-furniture-set) designed for smaller spaces that work perfectly indoors.

Storage is another consideration. If you're planning to move pieces between indoors and outdoors, make sure you have a plan for protecting them during harsh weather if they're not designed for year-round outdoor use.

I've been using outdoor furniture indoors for about three years now, and I honestly can't imagine going back to traditional indoor furniture. It's practical, stylish, affordable, and so much less stressful to live with. My house feels more relaxed and casual, which totally fits my lifestyle.

The best part? When people compliment my furniture (which happens all the time), I get to share this little secret. Most people are amazed when they realize how much money they could save and how much easier their lives could be with this simple switch.

If you're considering making the switch, start small. Maybe try an outdoor dining set or a single accent chair first. Once you experience how great it is to have furniture you don't have to baby, you'll probably end up like me – converting your whole house piece by piece.

Trust me, your wallet and your stress levels will thank you. Plus, you'll have furniture that can actually keep up with real life instead of furniture that makes you nervous every time someone sits down with a drink.",1,1751573311.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
1lqzid6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqzid6,Excellence Riviera Cancun - my experience,"Writing this review about a week after coming home from the vacation. My partner and I (mid-30s) stayed at this AI the last week of June and wanted to give a quick review to help anyone in decisions. 

Pros:
+ Landscaping and grounds were absolutely beautiful. You can tell the gardening team works very hard, not a single blade of grass was out of place and foliage was well kept. 
+ Room was very comfortable and updated. We opted for a Junior Suite (no swim-up room). Imo the swim up suites are overrated and from what I could tell, you essentially have a wooden platform as the patio you step out onto from your room and then have to walk through some grass to your swim ladder into the pool. Whereas we were in a junior suite on the 4th floor and we had a really great view of the lazy river pool from our balcony. 
+ Access to free water activities. There is a little hut on the beach where you can sign up for a sailboat catamaran ride, check out kayaks/paddleboard. We signed up for the sailboat catamaran tour which was really nice. Only about 30-40 minutes, but once we broke out past the sargassum, the water so blue and clear, and we were able to jump off the boat and swim for a little bit.
+ Paid water activities. For $55 you can go on a 1.5 hr snorkel tour - about 45 min on a powered boat round trip and 45 min in the water. I opted for this and had a really nice time seeing plenty of fish and the reef in the ecological preserve they took us to nearby. There are other opportunities for other paid activities such as a beginner snorkel class that leads to going on a dive with the instructor in a small group. 
+ Pools. There are 3 main pools (2 additional for club members) that were very nice and had plenty of seating. Super clean and calm for the most part. One of the pools gets used for pool activities like volleyball for about 45 min during the day. 
+ Fitness activities. Plenty of effort goes into fitness activities throughout the resort. We went on a guided morning bicycle tour (8 people max) and had a 20ish minute ride to Puerto Morelos, got about 25 min to explore the town, and then the ride back to the resort. They also have morning exercise classes (stretching, yoga, HIIT) and the gym is well equipped and updated with treadmills, cycles, 5 benches, 2 dumbell sets, a kettlebell set, and squat rack. 
+ Evening activities. Each night there was something different - silent disco, a duo that did country song covers, a jazz concert, and a DJ night. They really only play EDM type music and nothing danceable. I think a lot of these activities were out of place for Mexico, but I guess the resort just tries to cater to their customer base. We checked out Friday AM, but this is their night for their Mayan and Mexican cultural entertainment. 

Cons: 
- Staff. For the most part, everyone (bar staff, restaurant staff) had an attitude that was nonchalant and uninterested in service. It seemed like everyone was just tired of their job. Not what I would've expected from this tier of resort.
- Food. The reason my partner and I chose this resort was because of the food reviews we saw on reddit rating this as better than average. Overall, I would not want to come back again because of the food. Breakfast was OK due to the fact that they had a hot breakfast bar with made to order options across omelets, Breakfast tacos, chilaquiles, pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit, coffee and juice. Juice across the board seemed entirely watered down as if 1/3 was actual juice and the rest water. Lunch was OK, with a lot of typical American cuisine options on the menu. Pictured above is an order of wings we ordered which were just very sad. I understand wings are more of an American food so don't expect to have anything top tier when ordering in Cancun, but these felt like they were boiled and then dipped in sauce and plated. Dinner was edible at best. The first night we ate at the Mexican restaurant (Agave) and the food came out with vegetables that were uncooked, the proteins lacked any type of seasoning, and was just served not even warm. The next night we left the resort to eat somewhere else. The following night I gave a Spanish cuisine place (Flavor Market) a chance. Pictured is an appetizer and a dessert. We didn't even order a main entree. We left the resort the following night to have dinner. 

I will say, we were traveling from San Francisco and we enjoy a very good food scene. I understand I probably needed to manage my expectations at the resort, but I think all around dinner just missed the mark entirely and left me disappointed. If you are from a food city, don't come for the food. 

- Spa. Very overpriced. Paid $193 USD + tip for a 50 minute deep tissue massage. The spa and experience were nice, but the massage itself was average and wish I had paid maybe $120 for this instead. 

- Sargassum. Writing as a con, but it was expected. We knew this time of year would be tough to enjoy the beach for swimming near the shore, but that didn't keep us from sunbathing or using the cabanas/loungers set up on the beach. The resort did have a tractor and beach rake that they tried their best to mitigate the sargasum with. 

TLDR: Average experience. Beautiful resort, loved the water activities, food was a miss for me specifically because of dinner, staff was not helpful or friendly, avoid the spa, expect sargassum the rest of the summer. Personally, I would not come back. ",2,1751573298.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,1.0,False

1lqzglt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1lqzglt/why_is_getting_coffee_and_drinks_so_expensive_in/,Why is getting coffee and drinks so expensive in London?,"Disclaimer: I'm an American who grew up in New Jersey.

It's my first trip to the UK, and I'm amazed by the prices of coffee and drinks. A single espresso in London or Edinburgh (the two places I've visited so far) seems to cost between £ 2.20 and £ 3, which is surprising considering the \~1.4 exchange rate from pounds to USD. At restaurants, I've seen prices go up to £ 3.30, which feels like a rip-off. 

I stopped at a pub with my family for pints, and there were no prices posted (the Duke pub, London). Not posting prices drives me crazy. Is that a shared opinion? When prices are posted, a pint ranges from about £5-6, which is roughly $6.8-8.2 USD at the time of writing. I thought getting a pint or two at the pub was a typical thing for guys around here, but at those prices, I'm not sure you could afford the 1500-2000 PPM for a 10 square meter flat, especially as a student or young adult with limited funds. 

Cocktails cost around £11-14, which is about $15-19 USD at the time of writing. Even an Aperol spritz...

I haven't been to a large grocery store yet, just Sainsbury's and Tesco Express. What are their prices like? Will I be able to live like a normal student in central London without incurring excessive expenses? I'll be staying in Marylebone or Camden Town, but I haven't had a chance to explore those areas yet.

I understand why food is expensive since most of my food was made in the UK; that's something I'd be proud of as a Brit. What I don't understand is how an espresso can cost USD 4.50 at a Black Sheep or Nero Express. In the US, Starbucks doesn't even reach that level of rip-off. 

Will I be able to eat out occasionally as a student? Or do most students stick to meal deals at Tesco? This is not a criticism of the UK. There's a piece of the puzzle I'm missing, as I've seen Reddit posts from people asking why food was so cheap here just six years ago (I noticed that inflation peaked at 10% about two years ago). Food is affordable just across the English Channel in Paris, a city with food that is just as fresh (dare I say, less fattening) but comes at a more competitive price point.",0,1751573181.0,AskUK,13,0.33,False

It's sadly true but I can understand why people would think that its AI due to the absurdity of it. Secondly, thank you everyone for the advice in the comments of my previous post. I was lost and looking for some advice because of the uncomfortable situation and people around me felt differently about it than I did. People in the comments were right and I should trust my own feelings rather than searching for answers from the people around me. That's something that I've struggled with my whole life because my family is very reliant on each other and my parents are both helicopter parents. So I learned from young age that I couldn't trust my own instincts because other people know better. Which is why I asked my friends and mom about the situation. I have a lot more work to do in trusting myself but at least I'm working on it now. 

Here's the update:

After my previous post, I read through some of the comments and realized that what my boyfriend did would be considered assault. It wasn't something that I had even considered because I was only seeing it as him doing something stupid in the bedroom that broke my boundary and made me uncomfortable. But seeing those comments opened up my eyes a lot. If he was willing to break my boundary only after a year of dating and could do that to me in the bedroom than what else could he be capable of?

I met with him the next day at our apartment and I told him about my feelings which he didn't seem to care about. I showed him the reddit post so that he could see that other people were also uncomfortable with what happened. He read through your comments but when he saw the word 'assault' being used a few times he got really aggravated. I had never seen him that angry before but he was screaming nonstop and he even whipped my coffee mug across the room. I ended up crying because I was scared and I think that snapped him back to reality or something because he stopped yelling and was trying to comfort me. I made him leave our apartment again because I didnt want to be around him anymore. That night my friends helped me pack up my stuff and they took me to my parents house which is where I'm at now. 

After I was out of the apartment and safe, I called him and broke up with him over the phone because I didn't feel comfortable doing it in person after his previous reaction. I'm so upset that I wasted over a year of my life dating him and even thinking about a future with him. Thank you all for giving me the courage to follow my feelings and break up with him for good. I really appreciate it. Also, thank you for all the jokes its lightened the mood and has helped me feel a bit better about this situation. Yes ezagreb, the magic is gone and its time for me to disappear.",6,1751573067.0,relationship_advice,1,0.88,False

Zyphon Edge is available in most parts of:

- Europe  
- North America

- Select countries in Asia  

However, due to regulatory restrictions, some countries—especially where financial trading laws are strict—may not have access. Before signing up, it’s worth checking their official website or customer support to confirm availability in your region.

## Zyphon Edge – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Zyphon Edge shines with its **real-time market data**. It constantly scans multiple asset classes and exchanges to spot trading opportunities instantly. Unlike slower platforms, this speed can help you catch profitable trades before they vanish.

The system uses historical data and trend analysis to filter out noise, which is great for users who want actionable insights without sifting through mountains of charts.

### User-Friendly Interface

If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by complex trading dashboards, Zyphon Edge will be a breath of fresh air. Its **clean, intuitive layout** makes navigation simple. You can easily set your risk parameters, view open trades, and adjust alerts without digging through menus.

This design lowers the learning curve, which is especially helpful for beginners trying automated trading for the first time.

### Mobile Accessibility

Trading on the move? No problem. Zyphon Edge’s **mobile app** lets you stay connected and manage trades anywhere. Notifications and alerts come straight to your phone, so you never miss a beat.

The app balances functionality and simplicity, allowing quick decisions without feeling cramped on smaller screens.

### Customizable Alerts

One of the smartest features is the ability to set **custom alerts** for price changes, trade executions, or market news. These alerts keep you informed and let you react quickly when conditions change.

You can tailor alerts by asset or risk level, making sure you only get notified about what matters most to your strategy.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Zyphon Edge doesn’t limit you to just cryptocurrencies or Forex. It supports a **wide range of assets**, including stocks and commodities. This diversification helps spread risk and opens more trading opportunities.

Whether you want to focus on Bitcoin, Forex pairs, or gold, Zyphon Edge has you covered.

## Is Zyphon Edge a Scam?

From my research and user feedback, Zyphon Edge **does not appear to be a scam**. It operates like other legitimate automated trading platforms with real brokers and regulated payment processes. The platform has a decent reputation among users for delivering on its promises and providing reliable customer support.

That said, no trading platform can guarantee profits. Always approach automated trading with caution, use risk management, and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Zyphon Edge?

To get started, Zyphon Edge requires a **minimum deposit of $250**. This is fairly standard among similar platforms and serves as your initial trading bankroll. While some might find this steep compared to free demo accounts or lower-threshold platforms, it strikes a balance between accessibility and serious trading.

Keep in mind, your deposit goes directly into the broker account facilitating your trades—Zyphon Edge itself doesn’t hold your funds.

### Zyphon Edge Customer Support

Customer support is a crucial factor, and Zyphon Edge offers **24/7 live chat and email support**. From my experience, their agents are responsive and helpful, guiding new users through setup and troubleshooting.

They also provide educational resources and FAQs on their site, which is handy if you prefer self-help before reaching out.

## How do you start trading on Zyphon Edge?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head over to the Zyphon Edge website and fill out the registration form with your basic info—name, email, and phone number. The process is quick and straightforward.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you’ll need to verify your identity by uploading documents (ID, proof of address). After verification, you fund your account with at least $250 via supported payment methods like credit cards or bank transfer.

### Step 3: Start Trading

With funds in place, configure your trading preferences—choose assets, risk levels, and alert settings. You can then activate the automated trading bot or manually place trades if you want more control.

## How to Delete a Zyphon Edge Account?

If you decide Zyphon Edge isn’t for you, account deletion is possible but not instant. You’ll need to:

- Withdraw any remaining funds  
- Contact customer support to request account closure  
- Follow any verification steps they require  

It’s a straightforward process but expect some back-and-forth to confirm your identity and ensure all trades are settled.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Zyphon Edge Today](https://tinyurl.com/2d58eftr)

1lqze04,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreSocial/comments/1lqze04/any_decently_read_girl_who_is_into_stock_markets/,"Any decently read girl who is into stock markets, foreign policies up for a coffee date around Kalyan Nagar/ Church street?","I’m 32. I’m an engineer from Symbiosis Pune. Post engineering I’ve left my Masters seat in the US to get into filmmaking. I’ve been in films working as an Assistant Director for 7 years. I’ve then moved to Bangalore in 2022 and joined an ad agency as a copywriter. And suddenly I’ve realised that I’m 32. It’s been an year since I’ve quit my job as a copywriter and I’m meaning to start my own exports business now ( decided to concentrate on making some big bucks now oh and also I’ll get to travel).

I’m passionate about financial markets, stocks, start ups, psychology, spirituality, retro Hindi music, books, cricket, cinema, life and its purpose at large. I’ve been hitting gym also since 6 months.

It’s not all that much about just dating or hooking up but I’m kinda keen on having some genuine female energy in life. You know like somebody to talk to or go out on walks with and discuss life with.

So if any of you are interested please hmu. Cheers!

1lqzdpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1lqzdpu/we_had_one_coffee_and_now_this_guy_calls_me_his/,We had ONE coffee and now this guy calls me his “WORK WIFE” like we’re in a relationship I NEVER agreed to 😭,"I started this new job around three weeks ago and this guy from my team immediately started acting like we were some kind of inseparable duo. At first I thought he was just being helpful offering to walk me through the system, hovering over my shoulder while I learned the ropes, even jumping into convos I was having with OTHER coworkers like we’d been working together for years.

He was everywhere. He’d interrupt to explain stuff I already understood and say things like “Don’t worry, I got her, she’s MY responsibility now” like he was assigned to be my handler or something. I tried to just laugh it off because I didn’t want to be the “cold” new girl, but I should’ve known better. ONE DAY, after a long shift, I agreed to grab coffee with him just to be polite and he has NOT let it go since. Now he’s calling me his “WORK WIFE” like it’s a personality trait. He says it CONSTANTLY, in front of our team, even in meetings. “Have you seen my wife today?” or “Wifey looks stressed, probably missing me.”

The worst part is the jokes he makes that are SO NOT FUNNY and actually kind of offensive. He said I was being “bossy like a real wife,” called me “emotional” when I didn’t laugh at one of his lame jokes, and even made a comment like “You must be on your period” because I wasn’t talking to him that day. He tries to hand me snacks I never asked for, pulls my chair out like we’re on a date, blocks the hallway saying “You can’t escape your husband,” and even asked if my real boyfriend was “jealous of our connection.” WHAT CONNECTION. I barely speak to him unless he inserts himself into my space. 

He thinks we’re close and makes it seem like I’m in on the joke but I am absolutely NOT. I feel super uncomfortable but I’m still new here and trying not to cause tension, yet I’m slowly losing my mind because this man genuinely believes he’s in some kind of office rom-com and I’m the lead female when really I’m just trying to do my job and GO HOME!",3,1751572983.0,coworkerstories,1,1.0,False

1lqzcnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMAU/comments/1lqzcnf/if_youre_struggling_to_find_a_solution_try_this/,"If you’re struggling to find a solution, try this","Hey guys, I’m glad I found this community, it’s nice to know I’m not the only one suffering with this and that I might be able to help others who are suffering with the same situation. 

I’ve been going through this for around 15 years now since I first discovered I had a problem. I’ve heard all the usual “has somebody farted?” comments etc, and seen people cough or cover their nose in the past, so I know what you’re going through. I’ve gone through it completely on my own as when I first became aware of my situation I don’t think Reddit even existed and I never found any other forums at the time. I only ever spoke to a couple of friends about it and my parents, but all of them denied smelling anything so I’ve been living for years now wondering if it’s all in my head, but there’s just too many coincidences for it to be.  

When I first suspected I had this condition I tried everything I could to find a solution and not much worked. I bought a bunch of products to try and clean my gut I was paranoid and depressed all the time but I think, over the years, I found the formula to reduce or eliminate the smell altogether as I rarely hear comments now, unless I don’t stick to my routine. It’s difficult to fully know if this solution works as I’ve never been able to smell it on myself, but one thing I found was my clothes would smell sometimes which they don’t ever now. Also I use a scented moisturiser on my body after I shower in the morning and I use that to gauge how I’m smelling throughout the day. On a normal, symptom free day I can smell the moisturiser on my arm for half a day until it naturally wears off, on a bad day the nice smell is gone after an hour or so. 

If some of you are still struggling and haven’t found anything that works, give this a try and see if it helps. I’m not a professional but these are things I believe helped me:

1) the main thing is your diet in my opinion. I have a strict no fish and dairy diet now. I also eat very little red meat and try to avoid smelly foods in general like onions and eggs. I believe our bodies struggle to break down hard to digest foods and convert the bad smell in these foods. I will have cheat meals the night before I know I’m not working or I don’t need to leave the house, so you’re not missing out completely, but dairy is the one thing I never have regardless and fish very rarely. There are lots of nice alternatives now so I don’t miss it. 

2) I worked on making my bowel movements more consistent by taking mild, natural laxatives daily for around a month until it became routine to go once every morning shortly after I wake up. A coffee and a few puffs on a vape is enough to get things started now. I suffer from constipation if I don’t eat well or drink enough liquids so you need to be wary of that.

3) I drink a vegan protein shake once a day which has one scoop of protein powder, one tbsp of chia seeds and 2 tsp of a lepicol which contains psyllium husk, inulin and 5 strains of live bacteria. This helps with bowel movements and good gut health. 

4) I take vitamin b2 before eating every meal (if I can) but sometimes just once a day now. It helps convert the tma into a less odorous form. 

5) I take one 20mg tablet of zinc every morning. It is known to help neutralise short chain body fatty acids which are a component of body odour. 

6) I quit smoking cigarettes and now I just vape. I think the tar etc in cigarettes only clogs up your body and makes it more difficult for your body to cleanse itself. It would probably be more effective to quit smoking altogether but I haven’t reached that stage yet. 

7) Finally, make sure you actually have good hygiene. Wash and brush your teeth properly at least once a day in the morning. Also use mouthwash. I used to think I washed properly but I realised I didn’t. Use a flannel to wash under your arm pits, your genitals and your a$$. I also use toilets wipes after every bowel movement to make sure I’m super fresh down there. That helps rule out if personal hygiene is the issue.

After doing all these things for years now, I never hear comments about smell. Once in a blue moon I might but that’s usually after I’ve eaten something I shouldn’t or haven’t been taking my b2 or protein shake for a while from laziness, but it’s very rare even then because I’m pretty strict with my diet.

I hope some of this helps you guys. I know what’s it like, I’ve been through it and I still struggle with it a little now but I do feel pretty much totally cured when sticking to this routine, so give it a try and let me know if it helps or please share your routine if you’ve found a solution that works for you.

1lqz8di,https://www.reddit.com/r/summariseme/comments/1lqz8di/20250703_health_headlines_breakthroughs_concerns/,(2025-07-03) Health Headlines Breakthroughs Concerns Today,"## Health Headlines: Weight Loss Challenges, Heatwave Dangers, and Longevity Insights

The health landscape on July 3, 2025, presented a complex picture, ranging from the challenges of weight loss medications and the dangers of extreme heat to insights into healthy aging practices. These developments highlight both the advancements in healthcare and the vulnerabilities of populations facing environmental and lifestyle factors.

**Weight Management and Muscle Loss:**

A significant portion of the news focused on the challenges associated with weight loss drugs and the need for a holistic approach to health.  Mr. Kumar, a 42-year-old, exemplified the complexities of weight management. He experienced significant weight loss while on semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist used to treat blood sugar and weight, but also developed muscle loss, characterized by cramps, balance issues, and muscle twitches. This is a known side effect of such medications, which work by mimicking gut hormones to reduce calorie intake. Experts emphasize that the use of such medications should be coupled with strategies to mitigate muscle loss.

**Managing Blood Sugar Spikes Beyond Diet:**

Alongside the weight loss concerns, the news also highlighted factors that can unexpectedly elevate blood sugar levels. According to Dr. Pranav Ghody, consultant endocrinologist and diabetologist, ""Many everyday factors, often overlooked, can quietly raise glucose levels."" Poor sleep, for instance, can decrease insulin sensitivity, underscoring the importance of a consistent sleep schedule and avoiding screen time before bed. Emotional or physical stress also triggers hormonal responses, particularly cortisol, which can spike blood sugar. Even short periods of stress management, like deep breathing or light walking, can be beneficial.

**Drug Addiction and Healthcare Vulnerabilities:**

A concerning development in Punjab, India, highlighted the vulnerability of healthcare facilities to theft and misuse of medications. The story revealed a series of thefts targeting outpatient opioid assisted treatment (OOAT) centers where buprenorphine is used to treat drug addiction. While this medication is intended to help individuals gradually withdraw from opioid dependence, some addicts are extracting and injecting it for a more intense “kick.” A senior health official noted that the tablets are “not available in the open market and are dispensed strictly through prescription under controlled medical supervision.” This situation underscores the critical need for enhanced security measures and oversight in healthcare facilities to prevent drug diversion and protect vulnerable patients.

**Tragedy and Violence in the Workplace:**

A particularly grim story detailed the tragic death of Jessica McLaughlin, a 7-Eleven employee.  McLaughlin died after her manager allegedly assaulted her, holding her down and preventing her from breathing. The incident, which occurred on June 24th, resulted in the employee being placed on life support and passing away eight days later. The manager’s identity has not yet been disclosed, and the investigation is ongoing. This devastating event underscores the critical need for workplace safety protocols and the potential for devastating consequences when such measures are inadequate.

**Heatwave Disaster in Europe:**

The European continent faced a severe heatwave, resulting in multiple deaths and widespread disruption.  News reports confirmed the deaths of four people in Spain, two in France, and two in Italy.  The early summer heatwave triggered health alerts and forest fires across several countries, leading to the closure of a nuclear reactor at a Swiss power plant. In Spain, two deaths were linked to a wildfire in Catalonia.  French authorities reported 300 people hospitalized due to the heat. Italy issued red alerts for 18 cities, and Germany forecasted temperatures peaking at 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), the hottest day of the year.  The crisis emphasized the urgent need for public health interventions during extreme weather events, including heatwave warnings and effective responses to prevent heat-related illnesses and fatalities.

**Ghee Coffee and Potential Health Impacts:**

A growing trend in health and wellness, ghee coffee, also known as bulletproof coffee, was also discussed.  This involves combining coffee with ghee (clarified butter), and is particularly popular in ketogenic and low-carb lifestyles.  Proponents claim benefits like sustained energy, weight loss support, and enhanced mental clarity. Kanikka Malhotra, a consultant dietician and diabetes educator, says, “Ghee is full of important fatty acids, like conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which has been connected to a number of health advantages like decreased body fat and weight control."" It's important to understand the long-term effects of drinking ghee coffee daily for three months before integrating it into your diet.

**Japanese Longevity Secrets:**

In contrast to the immediate health concerns, the news also provided insights into practices that may support longevity. Studies have turned to real life to better understand how to live longer.   Drawing on the example of Japan—particularly Okinawa, with a high population of centenarians—the news highlighted that long life is often a byproduct of everyday habits rather than a specific, isolated goal. The emphasis is on integrating healthy practices into daily life. This could be through things like facial massage, matcha, and rice water in the hair.

I’m sorry but in my humble opinion, and maybe this is because of who I am and my personality, but if I’m going to a cafe, I’m not going to talk to people and make friends with the cashier, yes a nice greeting is fine but at the end of the day, I just want good coffee.

1lqz5or,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1lqz5or/am_i_overthinking_this_or_is_something_off/,Am I overthinking this or is something off?,"For context, I’m a 33F and have been married to my 33M husband for five years. We’ve been having serious marital issues for a while now.. emotionally distant, basically in a dead bedroom.. and I’ve been feeling uneasy about a lot of things for a long time.

One thing that caught my attention recently: my husband has always gotten a haircut every two weeks, like clockwork. For years, he didn’t care about breath mints or gum before his appointments. But in the last year, he switched to a new male barber who’s closer to home.

Last week, right before leaving for his haircut, he randomly asked if I had any mints or gum. That’s not something he ever does. I asked why, and he said he was self-conscious about his breath, since we had just had coffee and the barber gets up close to him. I found it a little odd, but whatever, I told him where the Tic Tacs were.

Today, it happened again. He went to grab more Tic Tacs before heading to the same barber. I jokingly said, “Why are you taking those again? You planning to make out with your barber?” He got a little defensive and said it was because we’d just had garlic bread for lunch, and again, he didn’t want to have bad breath.

I pushed a little and asked why, in five years, he’s never cared about this before even with his past female barber. He said that in the past, his haircuts were usually in the mornings after he had brushed his teeth.. so he didn’t think about it. This was not true because his appointments have always been at random times. Not just mornings. But I didn’t push any further. 

Maybe I’m reading too much into this, but something feels off. Why does he suddenly care so much about what his male barber thinks? I even asked how close the barber gets to his face, and my husband stood up and mimicked the position next to me. Honestly, it didn’t seem close enough to be able to smell someone’s breath.

One more thing, before we had lunch and he asked for the TicTac’s, he told me his barber texted him that he could come 30 minutes early (12:30 instead of 1:00), but my husband replied he could only come 15 minutes early at 12:45 cause he was pinched for time and we needed to eat. Looking back now all of this just seems strange. 

I’m being paranoid because of the issues in our marriage, but this little change in behavior is nagging at me. Am I overthinking this?


TL;DR: Husband of 5 years suddenly started caring about having fresh breath before haircuts with his new male barber, which he never did before. He’s defensive when I bring it up, and the change in behavior feels suspicious given the state of our marriage and lack of intimacy. Not sure if I’m being paranoid or if something’s off.

Fast forward to now, two months later, I met a guy again who happens to, again, meet every criteria on my list. He is a real gentleman and he did not make a move on me even after knowing each other for weeks but he would be really nice to me, not in a flirty way but just nice. I always thought he was a really handsome guy but he’s very formal and polite. 

Anyway, two days ago he said to me “I’m scared to ask but.. are you dating anybody?” and I wasn’t so he asked me out on a date. I have been working and I didn’t want to take time off to go on the date so I asked him, how about we go on a run instead? I usually morning runs alone. He agrees. 

Dude pulls up ready to go, brings bottles for the both of us, brings waffles for breakfast, brings coffee, got sunscreen, prepared everything. We did a few laps, he even tied my shoelaces and carried my phone and stuff and later we met for brunch. Opens my doors, pulls my chair, you know, the whole schbang. As I was leaving I told him I really appreciate how thoughtful he is, and he shrugged and said “it’s nothing, really” and seemed to actually think it was bare minimum…what a RAGING GREEN FLAG. We sat in his car and talked about a lot of things and I feel we share the same opinions and values. I’m a strong headed, opinionated woman but he likes it. He has a very accepting heart and it shows. 

I’ve been getting to know him and he is such an amazing person. I feel very comfortable around him, like I’ve known him forever. I never thought I’d be one of those girls who want to marry the guy after a first date but I sure am thinking about it. lol. We have a proper date date lined up this weekend. 

The issue is, I don’t know if I should keep going out with him. He is amazing but I took time off of dating because I was burnt out and it just so happens that I meet guys I like when I’m no longer looking to be with one. I want to do me and only me for some time .. but this is a complicated situation. I really like him but I’m not sure if I’m ready to commit to something like this. My friends often tell me that they don’t find guys who are their type , in my case, I have no trouble meeting them but I always end up complicating things. Dating does something to me.. I tend to get too entangled with the person I’m dating and I start to lose my sense of self. I really like him and don’t want to put myself through it again. Has anyone had a similar experience?

Neither of us was looking for a relationship as we’re both healing and going to therapy but after 6 months of getting to know each other I caught feelings for her. She wasn’t perfect or anything but I felt at peace around her and all issues would come up, be discussed and fixed. It was nice and we got along really well. She was good enough. She had her issues, such as having trouble with being consistent, needing lots of time by herself and fear of physical contact. I noticed all of this and told her that I cared and if there was any way I could make her feel at ease I would try my best to make it happen. I didn’t mind her needing time and as for physical contact I resorted to just asking her if she was feeling up for a hug and reassured her that she could always refuse with no hard feelings. It seemed to be going well, to the point where she’d fully open up and let herself go at times and sometimes even be genuinely happy to be hugged. One could say she was always a bit ‘avoidant’, she herself thinks she is one, but I don’t like labeling people. We’re much more than that. 

Of course when it came down to my feelings it ended poorly, to the point where she was quite cold and distant and blamed me for not seeing the signs when she was never consistent to begin with. I thought that even in a worst case scenario we’d still be friends but she wanted ‘just coworkers’ and a lot undefined time. She was a dear friend first and foremost and losing it all just by me feeling more felt quite unfair. I wasn’t perfect mind you, I handled most things well but there were the few times I was too clingy which made her feel suffocated for space. I messed even after by calling her, I shouldn’t have done it and it was stupid on my part. We argued, she screamed, told me she wanted me to respect her boundary and vacate all spaces we shared outside of work. It was on me for calling her, I don’t blame her for reacting with anger. I apologized, fixed my mistake and foolishly gave her what she wanted by making myself scarce of all the spaces we inhabited together at the expense of my own need for community and friends. Months later she’d tell me that I shouldn’t have taken her words for it as she was angry at the time but was I really wrong to do so? If she didn’t mean any of it she had opportunities to notice and rectify but she didn’t. Is it on me? Was I expecting too much? Love really does a number on critical thinking at times.

Eventually, months later, I asked her if she was happier with the compromises I made, she was, so I told her that I felt like my boundaries were being crossed and that she could deny me my spaces no longer: I wanted to socialize as normal. I wanted to have a calm discussion, fix things and move on. I knew she’d be hesitant so I gave her time to decide when and where to talk. She was very angry and said we had nothing to talk about. I was back into my group (+ newcomers), I hadn’t told anyone about what was going on but it was quite clear and they had to know the gist of it. She wanted our things to be private, she was angry at the fact that I didn’t really hide that I liked her. It felt like a fair complaint so I fixed that by not disclosing anything moving forward. What I didn’t expect was that she had told everyone in our circle her version of events and that they had made another chat group and excluded me. I found this out by noticing subtle clues during the drive to a lunch we had planned. They all pretended that nothing was amiss and faked planning out our summer trips. I knew already.. She knew that I had trouble with being isolated, I had opened up about it while we were getting to know each other and had reminded her that this was one of the reasons why I wanted to talk it out and fix things so we could both coexist peacefully in the groups we shared. I’m prone to anxiety attacks and was on high doses of meds that day but it still felt horrible to sit through it. They didn’t mention a thing until I told one of them, a good friend, that I knew. 

It’s been haunting me ever since, I don’t know who I can trust, I feel like I tried my best to do things in a mature way, I tried to respect her needs and I made sure I fixed those things I did mess up. I’ve been feeling quite lonely and been isolating myself lately. I’m not as talkative as I once was. I was bullied and excluded a lot during childhood but I didn’t think I’d end up feeling the same way, if not worst, in my mid 20s.

Eventually they wanted to fix things, she was down to talk as long as she could bring the entire group as witnesses. Lots was said, I was gaslit into thinking that it was no big deal, that I was in fact overreacting and trying to manipulate them in turn (it was other people, not her specifically!). Apparently none of them wanted to make the other chat but somehow they still did and they assured me that they knew I’d catch up to their act when I asked them what they would’ve done had I been blind to it. I realized that she was hyper focusing on the few times I messed up and making a big deal out of the tiniest of things to convince herself that I was still trying to hit on her (like getting coffee before work in the same 3 meters area she does, if only it wasn’t the only place you can get one..). 

She thinks this is still solvable but what can we solve without actively communicating? We misunderstood a lot about what the other has been feeling but if we don’t speak to one another how are we to know? How are we to fix? I’m not saying it’s easy, I don’t like it either but she matters to me more than the discomfort does so I tried.. I did. And I know it’s hard for her but she knows she can tell me if she’s not feeling up to something and we can find a compromise like we used to do before. She says that that I’m ’basically a perfect friend’ (apparently) so why treat me like that? We don’t talk much anymore, I’m afraid of her and she’d rather not see me around as she says that it makes her feel horrible knowing that I’m struggling because of her. I just.. don’t get how someone can just change so much from one day to the next. Was me catching feelings for her so bad? It’s odd seeing her being so content with surface level relationships and violently pushing away people who genuinely care. I’m so confused, so scared, I don’t really know if I ever really knew her, or the others for that matter. I still have to work with them, which brings me no shortage of anxiety. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t hate her, I don’t believe she’s a bad person. I just don’t get what happened.. it feels like something that could’ve been solved by a 10 minutes discussion, like one of the many we used to have before, was blown out of proportion and turned into a straight up horrible and frankly traumatizing experience. 

I was permanently outed from the group in the end. 
This is the gist of the situation, there’s tons of details missing but I believe this to be a fair representation of the events, my mistakes included.
Can anyone help me get a read on things? I don’t know how to approach any of this and have been struggling with doing basic things for the last few weeks. Thanks for reading and for any reply that might come. And please, no overly harsh words about anyone involved, I don’t believe they’re bad people and I don’t hate any of them. She especially is a good person at heart, I know.

Hey Charlotte, I looooove your channel! You’re my companion through every day. I really need your help with this- AITA?
When I first met my friend, she told me she had a boyfriend M35 who lived in another city nearby. She would occasionally go there to meet him and he would come to our city to meet her. Eventually, they got engaged, although there was no ring given, they had fixed a date in the coming summer.
Now my friend works in an investment bank and makes really great money. It was a really big surprise to me when one day she told me that her fiancé had quit his job and wanted to join a non profit. It seems he had no ambition to make money, but wanted to do good in society. She seemed upset about his decision. However, I helped them by referring him to a cousin who leads a non-profit. My cousin didn’t think he was a promising candidate, but very kindly referred him to smaller non profits, who didn’t hire him as well.
I told my friend  that she needed to make peace with the fact that this man she was marrying would not make money, would not be ambitious, would never be able to support her. She kept cribbing that she wanted him to change. I advised her that the only person we can change is ourselves, and I also warned her that she should not go ahead with the wedding unless she’d made peace with his career choices.
However, they blithely went ahead. Then one day she came crying to me saying that he kept moving the date of the wedding. It all came pouring out- how she and her parents had gone to meet him and his parents, and the man had not shown up. How he insisted on spending less than $2000 for the wedding and wouldn’t agree to her spending more on her day. How he insisted on wearing a tshirt to the wedding and wouldn’t even agree to pick it up 6 months in advance so that she could match the colours to her dress. I was shocked and horrified by these stories. It sounded like the guy didn’t care about her at all. 
She told me she was breaking up with him, however they got back together. This cycle repeated multiple times. The most shocking one was when she was hospitalised for a surgery, he was supposed to be with her, but would instead go off to have coffee while she went for an endoscopy alone. Each time, she would fight with him, he would play the victim and end it. And yet, she continued to go back to him, even after very extreme situations. 
Initially, I felt a lot of pity for her, however, soon I began to feel disgusted with her. I began to think what kind of person will not even respect herself enough to walk away from something so toxic. I began to feel very uncomfortable when she would talk to me about her relationship. I felt very sorry, but I also felt that this is a thing she has the power to fix. I could not empathise anymore with her. She herself says that if any friend of hers were in this situation she would advise them to leave, but she won’t leave it herself. 
I’ll admit that this whole thing has been overwhelming for me. Once, I couldn’t sleep an entire night after speaking with her about this situation. I began to distance myself for my own peace of mind. I still talk to her, but I grey/yellow rock her when she talks about him. Honestly, I don’t want to indulge her with empathy anymore, but sometimes I feel like an Ahole. So AITA? ",4,1751572284.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

1lqz0ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lqz0ek/th_the_ninth_chair/,[TH] The Ninth Chair,"They say New Hope, Pennsylvania is where gay men in their thirties go to reinvent themselves. But no one tells you what happens when you actually do.

I came here after my engagement detonated—not unraveled, exploded. One minute we were picking out tile samples; the next, I found texts that made me want to launch those tiles through our floor-to-ceiling windows. Six years undone in six seconds.

So I left. Not dramatically—just…strategically? My marketing firm was easing into remote work anyway. When I pitched going fully virtual, they all but clapped. Apparently, I’m easier over Slack.

New Hope felt like the anti-Manhattan. Where the city screamed, this town whispered. Where Chelsea was sharp-edged and posturing, New Hope was soft-focus and sincere. A little river town where rainbow flags hang from Victorian porches and elderly gay couples run antique shops with names like Second Time Around.

I rented a modest two-bedroom cottage on the edge of town. Hardwood floors. Actual windows. Birds instead of sirens. Neighbors who waved instead of avoiding eye contact. It was almost aggressively charming. The two lesbians I rented from were named Kim and Amber. I honestly just loved them because they didn't really bother me and let me keep to myself.

Those early days were exactly what I needed. Coffee on the porch. Work in silence. Walks on the canal path. Wine bar evenings at Nektar or The Salt House spent with books instead of business cards. Locals were kind but gave space. It was heartbreak rehab: social detox with a friendly smile.

Soon, I had my regulars. The barista with foam hearts. The bookstore guy who saved queer lit for me. The older couple at the farmers market who slipped me extra apples.

It felt safe. God, it felt safe. And I should’ve known better. Because nothing that feels that safe ever is.

Until that night at the Logan Inn. Until I met them. Until I realized that in New Hope, reinvention isn’t optional. It’s mandatory.

**WEEK ONE – THE INVITE**

I met them all one night at the bar inside the Logan Inn—America’s longest-running inn, now slick with Edison bulbs and $18 cocktails. Colonial charm with a side of curated cool. I was drinking alone, caught between looking mysterious and just sad, when they appeared—eight men, arriving like smoke.

One second I was adjusting my reflection in the mirror behind the bar; the next, they were there. Moving as one. Different, but in sync—like birds mid-flight, reading signals I couldn’t see.

“You’re Julian,” the tallest one said. Not a question. Just fact. “I’m Graham. We’ve been hoping to meet you.”

I didn’t bother asking how he knew my name—by then, I’d stopped being surprised by that sort of thing. The others crowded in, all introductions and expensive cologne and perfect posture.

There was Theo, precise and elegant; Rocco, warm and broad, with opinions about olive oil, I was sure. Trevor, ringed and sharp-jawed. Elliott, twitchy and tactile. Jude, the kind of forgettable that felt intentional. Henry, silver-templed with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. And Bennett—young, beautiful, and vaguely dangerous, like a pop-up ad with teeth.

They made space for me effortlessly, ordering my Malbec without asking, laughing before I finished my jokes. It wasn’t small talk—it was choreography. And I let myself lean into it.

“He’s perfect,” Theo said aloud, as if I weren’t sitting right there.

“I told you,” Graham replied. “The moment I saw him at Nektar the other day.”

I should’ve bristled at being discussed like a show dog, but instead, I felt chosen. Desired. Maybe my ex was wrong—maybe I wasn’t too much after all.

“We do Thursday dinners,” Graham explained, low and smooth. “Rotating homes. No phones, no flaking. Real conversation.”

“How long’s it been?” Elliott asked.  
“Years,” said Henry.  
“Decades,” said Rocco.  
“Forever,” said Jude, and they all laughed like I’d catch on eventually.

“You should join,” Bennett added. Not an invitation. A decision.

“I wouldn’t want to intrude,” I said automatically.

“We’ve been looking for a ninth,” Graham said, like he was naming a vacancy. “It throws everything off, being eight.”

“Nine’s the right number,” Theo added. “It always has been.”

“Everything’s better in nines,” Elliott said.

“It’s not just a seat,” Henry said. “It’s a role.”

A beat passed and then Graham said, “You’d be doing us a favor.”

Eight pairs of eyes stared at me. Time thinned. The bar noise dropped. Even the bartender seemed to vanish.

“Thursday?” I heard myself say. “What time?”

The moment shattered—their smiles returned, drinks reappeared, and Graham was already saving my number. “Seven sharp. Any allergies?”

“He’s allergic to shellfish,” Rocco answered before I could speak.

I blinked. I’d never told anyone that. I was sure of it.

“Small town,” he said with a smile. “Word gets around.”

We talked for another hour. Stories about past dinners. Near-fires, bad dates, blizzards turned sleepovers. Seemingly normal. But every so often, something snagged—a missing name, an edited glance, a silence where a memory should be. When they finally stood to leave—in perfect sync again—Graham squeezed my shoulder.

“Thursday. Don’t disappoint us.”

It should have sounded like a joke. But it didn’t. It felt like a test. A contract. One I’d already signed. I watched them leave through the mirror behind the bar—eight figures gliding out into the night. For a moment, I could’ve sworn there were nine.

**WEEK TWO – THE FIRST DINNER**

Graham’s home off of River Road felt curated—less like a house, more like a museum someone lived in by accident. Everything gleamed. The books looked lacquered, unread. The rugs absorbed sound. And the portraits—oil-painted men with disapproving stares—followed me like surveillance cameras.

“Family?” I asked, nodding toward one Civil War–era grimace.

“In a sense,” Graham replied, which wasn’t really an answer.

Wine was poured the moment I arrived—so it all felt whimsically weird instead of concerning. The others were already there, of course. Arranged in Graham’s living room like they’d been staged. When they turned to greet me all at once, it should’ve been unsettling. But wine and loneliness made it feel choreographed. Comforting.

Dinner was flawless. The table set for nine—my chair already waiting—with silver, crystal, and napkins folded like origami spells. Each course emerged from the kitchen as if summoned, no prep sounds, no smells, no mess. Graham would vanish and reappear with duck in cherry reduction or perfectly plated vegetables, like magic.

“Did you hire a caterer?” I asked.

“We take turns,” Elliott said, sipping wine.

But Graham hadn’t left the table long enough to plate toast, let alone a five-course meal. The wine never ran out. One glance away, and the glass was full again. Not refilled—full. As if it had never emptied. The music adjusted itself with our mood—lowering during stories, swelling with laughter, humming through silences. Like it was listening. Like it was alive. And they moved in perfect harmony. Finishing each other’s sentences with unnerving precision.

“Pass the salt,” Theo would say—three hands moved.

“Remember when—” Bennett would start—four voices finished.

They even breathed in sync. Like one body. One rhythm. Then, before dessert, they rose. All eight. Together. Glasses in hand. I scrambled to follow, knocking into the table. No one blinked.

“To Marcus,” they said. Eight voices, one sound. The chandelier trembled.

“May the ninth chair always be filled.”

They drank. I didn’t. I was too focused on how the toast felt ritualistic… and how I was sitting in that ninth chair.

“Who’s Marcus?” I asked.

The silence that followed pressed against my ears like deep water.

“A dear friend,” Theo said at last.  
“A tragic loss,” Rocco added.  
“Ski accident,” Trevor offered.  
“Cancer,” Jude said simultaneously. Then: “From the accident.”

“That’s not how cancer works,” I said, too drunk to be polite.

“It was a… rare case,” Henry said smoothly.  
“Broke his neck. Drowned. In snow,” Elliott said.  
“Which caused the cancer,” Bennett added with a straight face. “Very rare.”

I laughed. I couldn’t help it.

They didn’t. Their stares weren’t offended. Just… cold. Ancient. Like I’d broken something.

“Marcus was our friend,” Graham said. Quiet. Final. The room chilled.

“Of course. I’m sorry,” I stammered.

“You’ll understand,” Theo said, but it didn’t sound like comfort. It sounded like inevitability.

They returned to their seats in perfect time. Dessert appeared—soufflés, untouched by oven timers. But the air had shifted and their smiles felt strategic. Like they were managing me now. When I left, Graham walked me to the door, hand firm on my back.

“Next week at Elliot's,” he said. “You’ll come.” Not a question. A prophecy.

Driving home, I watched his house shrink in my rearview—every window still glowing. And in each one, eight silhouettes. Standing still. Facing forward.

Watching me go. Or waiting for me to return.

**WEEK THREE – THE COAT**

Elliott hosted the next dinner—his home a cathedral of design-blog minimalism. The house was all steel, glass, and curated emptiness. Even the food felt abstract—deconstructed, plated like sculpture. But the ritual remained: the synchronized conversation, the seamless laughter, the toast to Marcus that made my skin crawl.

Before leaving another dinner with the group, I stopped to use the bathroom. In the powder room, a mirror hung above the sink—ornate, fogless, and ever so slightly… wrong. My reflection held my gaze too tightly. I caught it blinking half a beat too late. Just once. But once was all it took to spook me.

I’d worn my favorite wool coat that night—the one from my agency days, when I thought tailoring could buy belonging. I hung it in a closet of identical black peacoats at Elliott’s house when I arrived and retrieved it without thinking, too eager to leave the uncanny choreography behind. 

At home, I reached to hang it up and felt something in the pocket. Slick. Stiff. Sharp-cornered. A photo. Glossy. Folded. Aged, but not ancient. Nine men at a dinner table.

Graham’s table, I realized—same carved legs, same chandelier—but the wallpaper was different. The paintings had different faces. A past version of the same room. And the men.

Eight I recognized immediately. Younger, smoother, but undeniably them—Graham, Theo, Rocco, Elliott, Trevor, Henry, Bennett, Jude. All in familiar seats, mid-toast or mid-laugh.

But it was the ninth that froze me. At the head of the table sat someone who looked exactly like me. Same bone structure. Same crooked ear. Even the gap in my eyebrow from a childhood bike fall. It was me. Except it wasn’t.

There were differences—subtle, sharpened. His cheekbones cast deeper shadows. His jaw was more angular. His eyes… His eyes were starving. Not metaphorically. Starving. Like something lived inside them that hadn’t eaten in years. I turned the photo over, hands shaking.

Written in careful cursive: ***“Marcus. Thanksgiving. 2009.”***

My chest tightened. 2009? I was in Bushwick that year. Miserable apartment. Dying radiator. Thanksgiving at my parents’ in Jersey, dodging questions about my love life. I hadn’t met these men three weeks ago! I'd barely knew New Hope existed. And yet… here was proof. A photo of them. And of me. Or someone who wore my face.

I thought... Prank? Photoshop? Hazing, maybe? I reverse image searched. Nothing. Facial recognition apps gave a 97% match. Lighting, they said. Expression. I even texted my ex the photo.

**Me:** “Does this look like me?”  
**Him:** “Why do you have old photos of yourself? Also please stop texting me.”

Old photos of *yourself*.

I stared at the shirt Marcus wore. Burgundy, soft-looking, fitted. The kind I’d admire but never buy. Yet I could *feel* the fabric. Could almost remember how it fit. The way the third button always came undone. But those weren’t my memories. Right?

I poured a glass of wine. Watched the photo while I drank. Eight familiar faces, untouched by time. One face that was mine, but wasn’t. That looked out at me with knowing. Marcus. The “dear friend.” Dead by ski accident. Or cancer. Or snow. Whose death changed depending on who told the story.

Marcus, who looked like me. But hungrier. Sharper. More.

I finished the bottle. The photo stayed real. If anything, the wine made it worse. His eyes seemed to follow me around the room. I put it in a drawer before bed. But I could still feel it—radiating. Breathing. I didn’t sleep. Just lay there, thinking of 2009. Of rituals and toasts. Of the ninth chair, waiting. Of Marcus. And of how, when I’d first found that photo, my instinct hadn’t been fear.

It had been recognition.

**WEEK FOUR – TIME LOSS**

I started losing time. Not blackouts. More like skips. Like my life had been edited, and someone kept botching the continuity. I’d leave the grocery store, then suddenly be home—groceries shelved, milk in the fridge, bread in the pantry. Everything where it belonged. Except I didn’t remember getting there.

At first, I blamed the wine. Those dinners were turning into rituals of excess, and I’ve never been a heavyweight. But the gaps began showing up when I was sober. Deliberately, consciously sober.

**Tuesday:** I woke in my office chair, fully dressed. Laptop open to three thousand words of marketing copy for a client I didn’t recognize. It was good—my voice, my cadence. But I had no memory of writing it. No record in my email. My time-tracking app didn’t log a thing.

**Wednesday:** I went to sleep in my bed. Woke up at 3:33 AM, seated in a forgotten chair in the spare room, staring at a wall where a mirror used to hang. It was gone, leaving a dustless outline. My legs ached like I’d been standing for hours.

And then came **Thursday**—the reflection. While brushing my teeth, I noticed a lag. A fractional delay between me and the mirror. Barely there… until it was. I’d raise a hand, and my reflection followed—just off-beat. Smile. Blink. Move. Sometimes it matched me. Sometimes it didn’t.

Thursday night was yet another drunk dinner at Theo's home on Main Street overlooking the river that I barely remember.

And by **Friday**, I broke. I woke to a voice memo on my phone—recorded at 4:17 AM. My voice, but wrong. Too formal. Too precise.

“To Marcus. May the ninth chair always be filled.”

Then silence. Breathing—not mine. Deep. Rhythmic. Satisfied. There were seventeen more. All recorded between 3 and 5 AM over the past week.

“The ninth chair must be filled.”

“Marcus knows the way.”

“Eight is incomplete. Nine is divine.”

“He’s coming home.”

The last was the longest—**forty-three minutes**, timestamped during the exact time I’d been at Elliott’s dinner. I remembered being there. I remembered the food, the synchronized movements. But the recording… It was a dinner party. Clinking glasses, laughter, casual conversation. My voice, warm and natural, deeply woven into theirs.

“This duck is perfection, Graham.”

“Remember Prague, Theo? The restaurant by the bridge.”

“We should vacation again. The nine of us. Like old times.”

Old times I hadn’t lived. Inside jokes I didn’t understand. But I delivered them like second nature. And beneath it all, another voice—*also* mine, just slightly off. Speaking in tandem. Echoing ahead.

One voice sounded like me pretending to fit in. The other like me finally returning. I threw the phone across the room. It cracked, but the evidence remained: I was being overwritten. Replaced.

Shaking, I reached for coffee—something normal, something grounding. I opened the usual cabinet but grabbed a mug from another. Burgundy with a gold rim. Not mine. I wouldn’t have bought something so pretentious. But it felt familiar. Right. Like it belonged to me.

I dropped it. Watched it shatter across the floor. Burgundy shards like blood. My hands trembled as I swept them up, a strange grief settling in my chest.

*Marcus’s cup,* a voice whispered.  
*Your cup,* another replied.

I poured coffee into a different mug, but it tasted wrong. Everything tasted wrong. I wanted it stronger. Wanted oat milk. Wanted things I’d never liked before—but that part of me suddenly craved.

I was unraveling. Losing memories, habits, preferences. Being replaced by someone who moved through this town with confidence, who belonged to these men, who toasted to long-dead dinners with perfect timing.

Someone who had done this before. Someone named Marcus. Someone who looked exactly like me—but sharper. Hungrier. More. Someone who wasn’t coming back. Someone who was already home.

**WEEK FIVE – THEY’RE IN MY HOUSE**

This Thursday, I told them I was sick. Not a total lie. I felt like my bones were shifting inside me, like my skin no longer fit. Food tasted wrong. Sleep came in flashes, broken by dreams of dinner parties I hadn’t attended but somehow remembered. My reflection had stopped pretending, moving however it pleased—sometimes watching me when I wasn’t watching it.

So when Graham texted about dinner at Rocco’s, I replied with a graphic food poisoning excuse. Added a nauseated emoji for good measure. Then I deadbolted the door, turned off the lights, and sat in the dark with a baseball bat across my lap like a suburban cliché.

At exactly 7 PM, the doorbell rang. I didn’t move. It rang again. Then a knock—measured and rhythmic. Knock knock knock. Pause. Knock knock knock. Like a heartbeat.

“Julian?” Graham’s voice. “We know you’re in there. Your car’s in the driveway.”

More knocking. More voices. Harmonizing with their knuckles.

“You can’t skip dinner,” Theo called, all warm amusement. “It’s tradition.”

“We brought soup,” Rocco added. “For your stomach.”

I stayed frozen, bat in my sweaty hands. Then the lock turned. The deadbolt I had set myself. It clicked open smoothly, like it had been waiting. Graham stepped in with a Dutch oven and a bottle of wine. The others filed in behind him, arranged like a ceremony. All smiling the same smile. All tilting their heads in concern.

“We’ve never skipped,” Graham said, stepping inside without hesitation. “It would break tradition.”

I wanted to protest. Scream. Swing the bat. But my body betrayed me—stepping aside, setting the bat down. Smiling.

“I’m really not feeling—”

“You’ll feel better soon,” Henry said, patting my shoulder. His hand was cold.

They moved through my house like they’d always lived there. Elliott opened the exact cabinet with my grandmother’s untouched china. Bennett found wine glasses I didn’t remember owning. Jude and Trevor repositioned the dining table with practiced ease. Theo pulled a burgundy tablecloth from my linen closet—one I’d never seen—and snapped it open like unfolding wings.

In minutes, my modest space became Graham’s dining room. Then the smells started. Duck again. Always duck. Bread fresh from ovens that hadn’t been used. Wine decanting in glassware I didn’t own.

“Sit,” Graham said, guiding me to a chair I didn’t recognize. A high-backed, ornate thing positioned at the head of the table.

“I don’t have nine chairs.”

“You do now,” Rocco said, placing soup in front of me. Steam curled in perfect spirals.

The others sat with synchronized precision. One moment standing, the next seated, napkins in laps, hands folded. I hadn’t cooked. But dinner was ready. Music played from invisible speakers. The lights flickered just enough to feel like candlelight.

“Eat,” they said in unison.

And I did. My hand lifted the spoon without asking me. The soup tasted like memories. Not metaphorically—literally. Each bite triggered flashes of unfamiliar familiarity: different wallpaper, different decades, the same eight faces always around the table.

“Good?” Theo asked.

I nodded. Because part of me remembered this soup. Loved this soup. Had always loved it.

When the duck arrived—again, always the duck—they raised their glasses.

“To Marcus,” they said, eyes fixed on me.

“To Marcus,” I echoed, the phrase slipping out like I’d rehearsed it.

“May the ninth chair always be filled,” we said together.

And I couldn’t tell which voice was mine. The wine tasted like coming home. Conversation flowed through me. My voice joined in without input, recalling Prague and New Orleans and Venice. Vacations I hadn’t taken. Memories I hadn’t lived.

“Remember,” they’d say. And I would.

I looked closer—and saw it at last. They flickered. Age skipping like faulty film. Graham’s smile stretched too wide. Theo’s fingers moved in impossible patterns. Henry’s hair shifted from silver to black to… something unnamed. And in their eyes—eight pairs—I saw myself. Not my reflection. Not Marcus. But the role. The ninth. The hunger that needed a face.

“It’s time,” Graham said, and the candles flared.

“Welcome home,” Rocco said, as the walls breathed.

“We’ve missed you,” Bennett said, his face shifting.

“You’ve missed us,” Jude whispered—and God help me, I had.

The room dimmed. The music swelled. And for a moment, I saw the chain—endless ninth chairs across time. Men who looked like me. Who were me. Who became Marcus, or Julian, or whoever the ninth needed to be. Then it passed. The lights steadied. I was sitting with eight old friends, finishing a dinner I’d helped cook, planning next week’s at my house.

It had always been my turn. When they left—synchronized, seamless—I stood in the doorway, waving. The ninth chair remained. Ornate. Familiar. Mine. Had I inherited it? Found it at a sale? Or… The memory slid through me like water. But I knew they’d be back. We’d all be back. Because Thursday dinners are tradition. And tradition is older than memory. And memory is just hunger with a good disguise.

**WEEK SIX – THE WALLS ARE SHIFTING**

My house was now changing. It started small—doorways slightly wider, hallways longer by a step or two. Easy to blame on sleep deprivation, paranoia. But Monday morning, I woke up and the walls were wrong. The bedroom was longer. Not by much—three feet maybe—but enough that my dresser no longer touched the wall. The window looked off, too small for the room. I measured. Twenty-two feet. It had always been nineteen. I checked the furniture receipts. Nineteen. The tape said twenty-two. The walls said twenty-two. Reality said twenty-two.

Tuesday: wallpaper. Burgundy Victorian with gold fleur-de-lis patterns that shimmered when I wasn’t looking. I hate wallpaper. I’ve never had wallpaper. But my hands *remembered* hanging it. I peeled it back—found more. Layer after layer, until I reached wood.

Wednesday: photographs. Frames I didn’t own, hung on rails that hadn’t existed yesterday. Dozens of pictures. Me, always me, in different decades. Seventies suits, eighties pastels, nineties grunge. Always at dinner. Always with the eight. Always Thursday. The oldest was a daguerreotype. Nine blurred figures. One of them had my posture. My smile.

I went to New Hope Photo. Asked if someone was developing photos under my name.

“Just like always,” the clerk said.

Apparently, I’d been a customer since 1987. Different film types, different payments—but the same name, same address. She handed me an envelope. Thirty-six exposures from last Thursday. Photos of me laughing, toasting—but wearing a face that looked increasingly like Marcus.

“Want to pre-pay for next week?” she asked.

I did. Automatically. Exact change, just like always. At home, the daguerreotype now hung above a fireplace that hadn’t existed that morning. Marble mantle. Candlesticks I’d “inherited” from a grandmother who was still alive in Florida—and had never owned silver.

My phone rang.

“Dinner at Henry’s,” Graham said. “Seven sharp.”

“I know,” I heard myself say.

“Bring the ’82 Bordeaux.”

“I will,” I replied—though I didn’t own one.

But when I opened my wine rack, there it was. Dusty. Waiting. And I remembered buying it. Storing it. Tending to it. No—I didn’t. Marcus did. Or Thomas. Or whichever version of me lived here last. I was being overwritten. By memories that weren’t mine but *fit*me. Like clothes broken in by someone else. Like a house slowly reassembling itself around the shape of who I was becoming.

And the worst part? It felt like home. As much as my brain was telling me to get out of here, my body wanted to stay. 

**WEEK SEVEN – THE MIRROR GAME**

I tested a theory. By now, my house couldn’t decide what century it belonged to. My bathroom had both a clawfoot tub and a smart shower that flickered in and out of existence. My fridge was sometimes an icebox, complete with blocks of ice that weren’t there the day before. Physics had packed up and left.

But nightmares follow rules. Patterns. And I’m good at patterns. So Thursday afternoon, before dinner at Henry’s, I ran an experiment. I set a mirror at the center of my dining table—not one of the ornate antique ones my house had started producing like mold, but a plain handheld mirror I bought that morning at CVS. Modern. Mine.

The ninth chair loomed at the head of the table, unmoved and unmovable. I’d tried once to drag it into the garage. Woke up bruised and sore with the chair back in its place, smug and waiting. So I left it. I sat at a normal seat. One place setting. One unscented candle. A glass of cheap wine with a screw cap. I wasn’t going for elegance—I was testing reality.

I felt ridiculous. Like a kid saying “Bloody Mary” into the mirror for a scare. But when I lit the candle, the flame burned *burgundy*. The wine in my glass turned dark and rich without me sipping it. The mirror’s surface rippled, though I hadn’t touched it.

“To Marcus,” I said. “May the ninth chair always be filled.”

My voice came out polished, ceremonial—like I’d said it a thousand times. Nothing happened.

The candle flickered back to orange. The wine soured. The mirror showed only me—tired, drawn, circles under my eyes from too many nights of shallow sleep.

I was about to give up. Blame stress. Blame gas. Blame whatever supernatural HOA managed this nightmare of a town.

Then I noticed the silence.

Not quiet. *Silence*. The kind that presses against your eardrums and makes your breath sound loud. My house had never been silent—there was always music, creaking, whispers in languages I couldn’t place. But now: stillness. Weighted. Watching.

I looked back at the mirror. My reflection wasn’t alone. Eight figures stood behind me. Not shadows—*absences*. Voids where light didn’t go. Each stood behind a chair, hands resting like mourners at a wake.

I didn’t turn. I *knew* if I turned, they’d vanish. This was mirror truth. Reverse honesty. The kind that only shows up when you stop trying to see it. The figures sharpened. I could make out the shapes: Graham’s tall frame. Theo’s restless fingers. Henry’s rigid stance. All in their seats. All smiling. Not visibly—but I *felt* the smiles. Proud. Expectant. The kind you give a child who finally ties their shoes. Not surprised. Just satisfied.

Rocco’s shape—broader than the rest—raised a glass. The others followed, synchronized as ever. A silent toast.

*To Marcus,* their gesture implied.

*To Julian,* it corrected.

*To the Ninth,* they agreed.

And I felt it—heatless, voiceless warmth. Approval. I blinked. They were closer.

Still behind the chairs, but leaning now, shadows stretching like fingers across the mirrored table. One—Bennett, maybe—touched the back of the ninth chair. I felt it on my neck. Cold. Deliberate.

Then, in the mirror, my reflection spoke:

“Always nine.”

But I hadn’t moved my lips.

**WEEK EIGHT – WHO IS MARCUS?**

I needed facts. Real, dusty, microfiche-level facts. Something outside my shifting house and misbehaving mirrors. The Free Library of New Hope sat squeezed between a wine bar and a crystal shop. Inside, it still smelled like old paper and quiet ambition—the way libraries should.

The librarian, ancient in the timeless way of people who never retired, didn’t ask questions.

“Obits from 2009?” she said. “Basement. Microfilm before 2010. Digital after.” The basement stairs creaked like a countdown. The air smelled like mold and memory. I found 2009 easily. November—Thanksgiving.

I scrolled past strangers until I saw it: **Marcus Langley. Age 34. Died suddenly.**

Two sentences. No cause of death. No survivors. No funeral details. Just a name, an age, and *suddenly*—as if death had ambushed him. I printed it. The paper came out warm, damp, the ink already blurring.

Next, I searched for photos. The librarian had mentioned yearbooks—full collection back to the ‘50s. *Town pride,* she’d said. I did the math. If Marcus was 34 in 2009, he’d have graduated in 1995. I found him on page 47. It was like looking into a mirror. Not a resemblance. *Me.*

Same eyebrow scar. Same crooked left ear. Same exact face. But in 1995, I was five years old, living in Jersey. Under his photo: Drama Club. Debate. *Thursday Dinner Society.* The name alone chilled me. And the friend quotes?

“Never change, Marcus!” – G.M.  
“Nine is divine!” – T.K.  
“See you at dinner forever!” – R.P.

His senior quote? **“Most likely to never leave.”**

Not a joke. A prophecy.

I flipped pages. Found a photo on page 173: nine teens around a dinner table in the home ec room. Eight familiar faces—young versions of Graham, Theo, the rest. Unmistakable, even with bad haircuts and teenage awkwardness.

At the head: Marcus. Me. Not me.

The caption: *Thursday Dinner Society celebrates another year of culinary excellence and friendship. Meetings every Thursday, same time, same place, forever and always.*

Then I looked closer—really studied the others. They looked *Marcus’s* age. Which meant if they were 18 in 1995, they should be in their late 40s now. But they weren’t. Graham maybe looked 45, but Bennett still looked 25. Jude maybe 30. Unless they hadn’t aged. Or had aged before. Or had graduated other years, other decades, other lives.

Unless Thursday Dinner wasn’t bound by time. I photocopied everything. Fed quarters into the machine until I had a pile of pages and proof. The last copy jammed, distorting Marcus’s face—our face—into a kaleidoscope of features that weren’t mine but might be.

I stumbled upstairs. The librarian looked up over her half-moon glasses.

“Find what you were looking for?”

“I don’t know,” I said.

She smiled. For a moment, she looked *younger*.

“They always come looking eventually,” she said. “The ninth ones. Trying to understand what they already know.”

I ran. Out past the wine bar, past the crystal shop, past people living in a world where mirrors behaved and houses didn’t rearrange themselves in the night.

At home, I laid the copies on my now-longer dining table. Studied Marcus’s face. My face. Our face. Until the lines blurred.

*Most likely to never leave.*

Not sentiment. Not praise. *Instruction.* Because the ninth chair doesn’t let you go. Because Marcus didn’t leave. Because no one ever really leaves. I was the new Marcus. Or the next version. Or the same version in a different decade. A face recycled. A role filled. A dinner that never ends. And I wasn’t arriving. I was *returning*.

I had always been here. Just waiting for myself to catch up.

**WEEK NINE – THE DINNER**

They asked me to *officially* host. Not invited—*asked*. Like it was owed.

Graham called Tuesday morning while I stared at yearbook pages, trying to find a difference between Marcus’s face and mine. There wasn’t one.

“Your turn again,” he said. “Thursday. The ninth dinner. The penultimate.”

Of course. Nine chairs. Nine members. Nine dinners since I met them at the Logan Inn. But how many cycles before me? How many ninths had counted to nine before dissolving?

“Next week is the tenth,” he said. “And you know what that means.”

I didn’t. But a part of me nodded anyway.

“I don’t—” I started, but stopped. Because I did. I *knew* how to host. The knowledge sat in my brain like furniture uncovered after a long absence.

 “Seven o’clock,” Graham added. “Don’t worry about the menu. It’s already decided.”

He hung up. I didn’t say yes. I didn’t need to. My answer had been written before I was. Tuesday and Wednesday passed in a trance. My hands wrote lists in a stranger’s handwriting. My feet took me to specialty shops I didn’t know existed. The shopkeepers greeted me by name. One corrected himself:

“The usual, Mr. Langley—I mean, Vance.”

But we both knew he’d been right the first time.

By Thursday, the house had decided on Victorian. Ornate wood, candlelight, a kitchen outfitted in copper and cast iron. Meals were prepared without my help. Place settings appeared on their own. At 6:45, candles lit themselves.

At 7:00 they arrived. No knock. No door opening. Just *presence*.

“Julian,” Graham said, but it felt like he was addressing someone much older.

They moved through the space like they’d always lived there. Bennett adjusted a fork by millimeters. Theo tuned the silence. Henry checked the wine I didn’t remember buying but had clearly been saving for this. No one cooked. No one poured. But the food came, and the wine flowed. The table served itself. Time bent around us.

“Beautiful evening,” Rocco said, though the windows showed only night.

“The ninth dinner,” Trevor said, lifting his glass. “Always special.”

“Always final,” Jude whispered.

“Not final,” Henry corrected. “Transitional.”

They sat with perfect precision. Suddenly I was seated at the head. The ninth chair. I didn’t remember sitting down. The table felt warm beneath my palms. The courses passed like dream scenes. Soup flavored with memory. Salad that shimmered. The duck—always the duck. Each bite brought flashes: different eras, same faces, same ritual. They spoke in riddles. Recollections from times that hadn’t happened yet. Dinners in cities that no longer existed. Ninths who had come before.

“Where do they go?” I asked. “The old ones?”

Eight faces turned to me. Smiling.

“Go?” Graham echoed. “They don’t go anywhere.”

“They’re always here,” said Theo.

“*You’re* always here,” said Henry.

And I understood. There was no replacement. Just accumulation. Marcus wasn’t gone. He was layered beneath me. And beneath him, others. All stacked in the ninth chair, century after century. At 9:09 exactly, they stood.

“To Marcus,” they said.

They looked at me.

“To Julian,” I tried to reply. But what came out was: “To Marcus.”

The voice was mine—but older. Hungrier. Practiced.

“May the ninth chair always be filled,” we said together.

The room spun. Time folded. And I *fell*—through Marcus, through Thomas, through names lost to memory. Identity layered like wallpaper, peeling back and back and back.

I woke in the ninth chair. Fully dressed. Alone. Hands folded on the table. The others were gone. The dishes clean. The candles burned down to stubs, but still faintly flickering. The house was… everything. Victorian and modern. Past and future. All times at once. I was still in my own clothes, but they *felt* different. Worn by someone older. A cufflink glinted on my wrist. Gold. Engraved. The letters shifted: J.L., M.L., T.P.—names that had worn this chair before me.

I removed it with practiced fingers. I had never worn cufflinks, but my hands had. I held it to the light—and saw: other hands, other nights, other dinners. A chain of selves, infinite and recursive, discovering what they already knew.

**THIS WEEK**

The day after the ninth dinner, it was like all 8 of them ceased to exist in the real world. Their homes are empty. The entire town seems to think I’m crazy when I ask about them.

And yes, I’ve checked. I’ve walked past each address from the past nine weeks. Graham’s grand colonial sits dark and completely empty now. Elliott’s glass cube of a house now wears three FOR SALE signs. Theo’s brownstone has no furniture—just dust dancing in light that doesn’t come from any known source.

But I *remember* being inside. I remember the meals. My body still carries their weight. My tongue still recalls the wine.

Even online, they’re ghosts. No more Instagram profiles. No digital footprints. I even paid for background checks—empty. I hired a private investigator who called me sounding spooked.

“These people can’t exist,” he said.

“But they do,” I told him. “Every Thursday at 9:09 PM, they exist harder than anything else.”

The Logan Inn—the bar where I first met them—claims no knowledge of Graham or anyone in the group.

“No parties of eight,” the manager insisted, scrolling their records. “Not ever.”

I showed her the receipt from that night. She squinted like it was in a foreign language. The ink must have shifted—showing a date from 2005.

“You feeling okay?” she asked. I laughed until she threatened to call someone.

Who would she call? The police? The therapists who’d offer diagnoses for conditions older than language?

That next night, I see them walk down my street. I watch from my window. Eight figures in sync stopping at my door. They didn’t knock. Didn’t speak. Just stood there—waiting. Smiling. Their smiles said: *We have time. We are time.*

They stood for what my clock called a minute, but my bones measured in centuries. Then they were gone. Not walked away. Just… gone. As if a channel had changed. The porch light glowed over empty space.

I found myself at the door without remembering how I got there. Opened it. Stepped onto a porch that was wood, stone, and ancient dirt all at once. The street was silent. No cars. No dogs. No life. Just me and the weight of something watching.

Something glinted on the doormat—a gold cufflink. Matching the one in my pocket. Matching the ones I keep finding like breadcrumbs dropped in reverse. It was warm. Recently worn. When I straightened, I wasn’t alone. A figure stood just beyond the porch light. Not one of the eight—I knew their shadows. This was someone else. 

Marcus. Not the memory. Not the metaphor. The *Marcus* from the photo. Sharp. Hungry-eyed. Wearing the burgundy shirt from the Thanksgiving image—and my skin remembered how that shirt felt.

“You’re doing well, Julian,” he said. His voice was mine, but in a minor key. “Better than Thomas. He fought it.”

 “You’re dead,” I said. It felt important.

 “Am I?” He stepped forward.

“I was at dinner last week. And the week before. I’ll be there next week. Death is just transition, Julian. Or would you prefer *Marcus* now?”

“My name is Julian,” I said. But it felt like reciting a spell I no longer believed.

Marcus smiled—*my* smile, but older. Practiced.

“Names are clothes. I was Marcus for thirty-four years. Thomas before that. William before him. The time changes. The role doesn’t.”

“What are you?” I asked. “What are *they*?”

“Hungry,” he said.

He touched my chest. His hand passed *through* me, into the space where identity lives. I didn’t feel pain. I felt… subtraction. Like shrugging off a coat.

“The others are aspects. Functions. Graham is welcome. Theo is rhythm. Henry is authority. They exist because the dinner does. And the dinner exists to feed the hunger.”

“Fed on what?”

“Time. Identity. The tiny deaths we suffer when we try to be someone else.”

He withdrew his hand. My chest ached in its absence.

“You’ve been feeding it for nine weeks now. Each dinner, you become less Julian. More… us.” 

“I want to leave,” I said.

But what I *heard* was: “I want to stay.”

Marcus stepped back. I saw through him—not transparently, but like layers: Thomas, William, others. Acetate ghosts.

“You came to New Hope to disappear. We let you. Gave you a new place to exist, a new role. A family that never leaves.”

“This isn’t what I wanted,” I whispered.

“Oh, but it is. You *chose* the ninth chair, Julian. You walked straight to it.”

He was already fading, like a photo left in the sun.

“Next Thursday everyone will return for your tenth dinner. Then the transition completes. I’ll rest. You’ll remain.”

“What if I don’t come?”

He laughed—*my* laugh, but stretched by centuries.

1lqyzn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1lqyzn6/the_box/,The Box,"Hey, I’m a young writer, I love writing first person view horror, I’ve written a few stories before this but I wanted other feedback on this story.



Story: I woke up in the morning, just like every other day. I flip the shower on, the water falling to the shower floor, I step in and sit there for a moment. Something feels..wrong…But what? Water feels fine, my bathroom is just as cluttered as usual, so what? Suddenly, the ring of my doorbell interrupts my thoughts. I wrap a towel around my waist, drying my hair slightly. I crack the door open, sticking my head out. Nobody is there, but as I look down I see a box. It’s tied with a red ribbon, unmarked. I quickly grab it, setting it on my counter and heading back up to finish my shower. About 15 minutes later I shut off the shower, dry myself and throw some clothes on. I walk downstairs, seeing the box on the counter. I look at it, my body stops. I left it on the counter, I know I did..but again something feels wrong. I then notice the glass cup a foot or so away. Wait..but I set the box right next to the cup, not that far…I reach for the handgun on my hip, pulling it halfway out. I cautiously walk down to the box. I open it, surprised to see nothing inside. “What the hell?” I say to nobody in particular. I throw the box away, figuring it’s some prank. But that doesn’t explain how it moved on its own. “I’m probably imagining things” I say to myself, searching for a viable answer. I slide my gun back into the holster, clicking the strap back down. I sit on my couch and flip on the TV. I turn on the news, it’s covering a young girl who was mutilated by an unknown assailant. Poor girl. The news covers a seemingly small detail that makes me freeze, my heart dropping to my feet. They found a box outside the girls home. Tied with the same red ribbon. But hers wasn’t empty, it contained a single, undamaged eye. Its said it belonged to the girl. I turn back to the box in the trash, my heart now pounding like a jackhammer. “I-I-I-it has to be a coincidence” I say, barely able to get the words out. I desperately rake my mind for a logical explanation, anything that will make this better. That night, I can’t sleep. I’m staring at the ceiling, my heart still thumping. “It can’t be true…I’m not gonna die…right?”. My thoughts are cut off by a sudden yet soft thud from downstairs, I shoot up in bed, reaching for my handgun on my nightstand. I stare at my door, as if expecting something to jump through. But there is silence…loud..no, deafening silence. It’s driving me insane, just me, my thoughts, and my ever growing heartbeat. I eventually calm down, setting my gun down and laying back down. I manage to fall asleep. I wake up early the next morning, flipping my shower on again, the same wrong feeling returning. I shower, drying my self off and throwing my clothes on again. I slide my shoes on, but just as my foot slides into the other one there’s another ring of my doorbell. I check the time, 9:17. I open the door, nobody. Nothing but another box, tied with a red string, I pick it up again, not noticing my quickened breath. I set it on the counter. I stare at it for what feels like an eternity, unable to move. Finally, I open the box…nothing… I toss it again, trying to calm my racing mind. I hop into my car, sticking the key in the ignition and turning. The engine stalls. I try again, turning the key again. The engine still stalls. I sigh, “great, just what I needed.” I step out and open my phone to call an uber. I open the app, pushing the button and calling a ride. After a few minutes a black sedan pulls up. I hop in, confirming it’s my driver. I set my bag in the seat next to me. I check my phone, May 10, Tuesday. I lean my head back, trying to relax. My mind still reels from what happened last night. Before I know it, the driving is telling me I’ve arrived. I thank him, pay him, and hop out. I walk into the office, sitting down at my desk. My friend, Mike, walks over, coffee in hand and same smile on his face. “Hey man, ready for today?” He says with surprising energy. “Guess so” I respond, still drinking my coffee. I guess he noticed something off, because he concernedly asks “hey, are you okay?”. I respond without thinking, “yeah, just somebody pranking me.” Mike leans a little closer, intrigued, “do tell”. “Well, I’ve been getting this boxes, both tied with the same red ribbon, both empty. Then I see on the news this-“ I’m cut off by mikes concerned, yet still intrigued voice, “didn’t the girl who died a few days ago also have those boxes?”. “I was getting to that, but yeah. It’s probably nothing though.” I say, still tired. “Whatever you say dude. Just stay safe” Mike says. “I will” I reply. He heads off and I start working. About halfway through the day, I’m called down for a package. I head down, confused. As I reach the lobby I freeze, my body going cold as I see the box. That familiar red ribbon on top. The mail person also seems slightly shaken up. He walks over to me, “are you Alex?” He asks. I nod softly, still staring at the box. “Uhh, y-yeah..yeah that’s me” I respond, taking the box. “Good luck” the mail person says, leaving swiftly. I stare at the box for a moment, heading back up to my officer chair, setting the box on my desk. Mike walks back over and pauses, his smile faltering. “I-is that..” he asks, unable to finish his sentence. I just nod. I untie the ribbon like usual, pulling the box open, I look inside, shooting up from my chair and nearly tipping it. A few people look but most ignore it. Mike looks inside and freezes. “Dude..isn’t that your house?” He asks concerned. “Yeah..yeah it is” I say, my fear now evident as I stare at the photo of not just my house, but the window to my bedroom. Next to it, lays a brick, slightly bloodied and scuffed. As I sit back down, the brick still on the desk, I realize something else is inside the box—folded tight under the photo. I hesitate, heart pounding, then pull it free. It’s a note. The handwriting is crooked, almost carved into the paper.
“You saw what she did. Now it’s your turn. Don’t fight it. You won’t win.”
Before I can react, my phone buzzes. A video. I tap it. The footage is grainy, black-and-white security cam… of me. Last night. Walking up someone’s porch, red ribbon in hand. I don’t remember it. I don’t even own those clothes. Mike steps back, his voice shaking. “Alex… when did you film this?” “I didn’t.” But even I don’t sound convinced. Mike takes a cautious step back, now pale. I’m left frozen, staring at the video. It’s me, but something is wrong..something is always wrong… I glance at the time, 4:44. It’s almost time for me to go home. I swear it was 12 o clock just a few minutes ago..whatever. I eventually get home. I stick my key into my lock, twisting it and the familiar click of the lock fills my ears. I push it open, letting it fall shut behind me. I twist the lock and toss my keys on the counter. I drop into the couch, flipping the tv on. I decide to turn on a show, maybe that’ll distract me from everything that’s been happening. I eventually drift off to sleep. When I wake up, my clock read 13:49. “Damn it.” I mumble, standing and shuffling my way upstairs. I drop onto my bed like a rock. As soon as I hit the pillow, I’m asleep. I wake up early that morning, I glance over at my clock. 6:45. I stand, my body feels heavy. I take one step, suddenly I’m falling. I hit the floor like a boulder. I manage to sit up. “The hell?” I mumble. I look down at my legs, they look fine. They feel fine. But when I stand, my left leg feels like it’s on fire. I can barely put weight on it. I call my boss, explaining my foot. I manage to limp outside, getting a ride to a clinic nearby. I walk in, explain my situation, fill out the form and sit down. About half an hour later they call my name. I limp over, the doctor hands me a crutch, which helped more than I thought. I sit on the bed and watch as the doctor rolls my pant leg up and slides my shoe off. “It looks like you sprained it, nothing serious.” The doctor says reassuredly. I let out a sigh of relief. But how did I sprain it sleeping? As if on cue, the doctor asks, “do you know how you sprained it?”. I respond, “well, I might. I woke up this morning, took one step and my leg gave out. I’m not sure if I sprained it falling or before then. The doctor processes this for a moment. “Hmm, when it gave out, did it hurt? Any burning feeling, or something like that?” I think for a moment, “well, I’m not sure I remember, I know it hurt when I put weight on it after I fell. The doctor nods, “alright, well we will get you treated and out of here.” The doctor says with a small, comforting smile. About an hour later, I’m walking out and sliding into Mike’s car. “Geez, what happened?” He asks. “Not sure, woke up this morning and couldn’t put weight on it. I fell, now I’m here.” I answer. Mike drops me off at my home, I limp inside, my ankle still throbbing softly in the boot. I shut my door and lock it, dropping onto the couch and letting out a tired sigh. I shut my eyes, just listening to the world for a moment. Thump thump. Thump thump. Thump thump. My heart beats in my head. Thump thump. Thump thump. Thump thump. I focus on it, my mind softly drifting. Thump thump. Thump thump. Thump thump. I drift to sleep with the gentle beat of my heart lingering in my head. I wake up at around midnight, I check the clock. 3:17. I groan, heading up to my bed, hoping for a few more hours of rest, when I get upstairs I freeze. My bedroom door is gone. Just an empty wall. I blink, it suddenly returns. I push it away and walk inside, dropping onto my bed. I drift off to sleep. The next morning  I wake up, walking down stairs. I slide my one shoe on just like before, but as I look down I notice my boot is gone. “What the hell?” I say out loud. I stand, leaning on my left foot. It feels fine, as if yesterday never happened. I open my phone and call Mike. “Hey Mike, you remember driving me home from the doctor’s yesterday, right?” I ask, half doubting and half scared. Mike is quiet for a moment, “what?” He asks confused. “You know, yesterday, when my leg gave out? I had to miss work.” Mike pauses for a moment, “you were at work yesterday, remember you got that box? With the brick?” “No, that was two days-..ago” my voice falls as I look at my phone’s calendar. May 11th, Wednesday. My eyes widen, but my racing mind is interrupted by Mike. “Dude, are you feeling okay? Maybe you should take the day off.” “No no..I’m fine..” I respond swiftly. “Seriously, you’ve been declining these past few days, I really think you should take a break.” He says, now concerned. Before I can respond, my doorbell rings. I get up, opening the door and finding another box. Same. Red. Ribbon. I grab and it put it on my counter again, ripping it open. It’s empty. Unmarked like always. I toss it in the trash, now annoyed by them. “Damnit”..Mike’s voice cuts through the silence “hey, I’m still here. And seriously, take the day off.” “FINE- I mean..fine, I will..” I’ve never snapped before, especially at Mike, what’s going on? Mike ends the call, I’m left standing in my kitchen, phone in hand, my mind slowly losing grip. “I’m fine..it’s just a prank” I tell myself. “I’m okay, I just need a break.” I repeat to myself, over and over, constantly assuring I’m okay. I sit on the couch and flip on the tv, I frantically flip through shows, nothing looks good..nothing looks funny..what is happening? I switch the TV off in annoyance. The next morning I wake up, the doorbell just making me angrier, I open the door, inside is an address I don’t recognize. I toss it, keeping the note. I look at the pile of boxes in my trash can, red ribbons and all. Suddenly, an idea crosses my mind. I grab a box, wrapping it in that red ribbon, just like the others. I drive to the address, dropping the box at their door and ringing the bell, I quickly drive off. I subconsciously let out a chuckle, a strange, creepy chuckle. The next morning the bell rings, but this time I grab the box and toss it in my car. I drive back over to the address, leaving the box there again and ringing the bell, a strange sense of enjoyment crosses over me, as I finally get the person back. I drive off swiftly. As I drive, I can’t help but smile, chuckling again as my mind slips deeper and deeper. More boxes come, I drive over, and drop them off. I’m angrier each time, but after dropping the box off I feel a twisted sense of happiness. one day, I open the empty box, I leave a picture of the persons house, and a brick. As if threatening them to stay away. I drop it off and leave, just like the other days. One day, I’m so angry, I drop the box off, but instead of running back to my car, I hide off to the side. The woman answers the door, she grabs the box, but just as she turns around, I jump up and grab her, my hand covering her mouth. I rush inside, forcing her down and drawing my gun. I press it against the girls skull, a psychopathic smile now spread on my face, I begin to uncontrollably chuckle. I push the gun harder against her temple as she cries and begs, but I don’t listen. BANG. Everything goes silent, the only noise the soft trickle of blood as it covers the floor. I look down at her body, eyes now half shut and drifted. It feels incomplete..she deserves worse..I know she does. I walk to the kitchen, pulling out a knife. I walk back to her body and begin sawing. First I cut skin, then muscle, then tendons and veins. Once I hit bone, I grip her mangled hand and blood covered forearm. I begin to twist. It goes further and further. Eventually, with enough effort, and a sickening crunch, the bone snaps. Her dismembered hand now dangling in my grip. I toss it aside and move to her elbow. Twist until it snaps. I don’t feel sick, I don’t feel remorse..just a blind anger, and a sickening joy. I do the same for the other arm, and legs. I move to her neck, pushing the blade against her skin. I begin to saw, eventually her head detaches, I notice the box she was holding, it was thrown when I grabbed her. Without thinking, I grabbed the girls head, forcing out in of her eyes, dropping it in the box and wrapping it back up. I drop it on her porch, leaving the home. I check my phone, 9:17. I slide into my car, driving home with a smile. I hop in the shower and wash myself deeply. I go out and wash my car, a strange sense of relief washing over me, I’m finally free. The next morning, I hear that familiar ring, confused, I open the door and find a man in all black, wearing a motorcycle helmet, holding one of those boxes, same red ribbon. “What.” I bark. The man responds in a calm, eerily soothing voice. “Congratulations on your first kill.” He says, handing the box over, I take it, opening it there in front of him. Inside, was a black body suit, that same black motor cycle helmet sitting on top. I look up at the man, then back down at the outfit, I pull the helmet out and slide it on. It fits perfectly, as if a calling. “Who’s next” I ask. The man hands me a note with another address. I slide the body suit on, it’s the same as the man’s.  I take the note, he hands me another box. Again, with that red ribbon. I drive to the house, leaving the box on the porch, ringing the bell, but this time I hide. The man takes the box, looking confused, he takes it inside and shuts his door. I look inside his home, I see him leave upstairs, I quickly, and silently sneak in. I look at the box on the counter. I reach out and move it slightly. Not big, but enough to make him think he’s going insane. For days, I leave the boxes in his porch, each day he gets angrier. One day, I place a box on his porch, an address inside. I follow him as he angrily places the box on their porch, ringing the bell and leaving. For days I watch him do this. One day, he hides off  to the side. I watch from afar as the woman grabs the box, he rushes her, and after an hour or so, he walks out bloodied, placing a box in the porch. He drives off. The next morning, I hold the box. My finger pressing that bell, One. Final. Time. He open the door, and I greet him, my voice calm and soothing. “Congratulations”",1,1751572028.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 1 - The Exile's Return

My breath hitched in my throat, each syllable a shard of ice: “Naomi Fox, I don't want to see you anywhere near here again unless I specifically invite you.”

Tears stung my eyes, barely kept at bay, as I focused on him, Walter Gonzalez, Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack—that face I had worshiped since childhood. A face that once radiated joy in my presence, now hardened into granite.

“Uncle Walter,” I whispered, taking a hesitant step closer, drawn by an undeniable pull.

“Stay back,” he snapped, recoiling as if burned, his wolf's snarl a guttural rejection. My heart plummeted into a void.

Alpha Walter was my guardian—the uncle I had chosen. He had been my father’s most trusted confidant before becoming my protector. I remember when he was my everything, and he cherished me like his own. But time, as it often does, warped everything. A forbidden desire surfaced the moment I understood what longing meant—a spark I pursued, a flame he extinguished, fearing its potential devastation.

“If you possess even a shred of self-awareness,” he said, his alpha tone piercing the air like frost, “sort yourself out, Naomi.”

Then he banished me—four years of exile...

Four years.

Standing at the threshold of the Silver Moon Packhouse, the weight of the intervening years crashed over me like a rogue wave. The air was thick with the familiar scent of pine and raw power—his scent—unaltered by time. My fingers traced the weathered runes etched into the doorframe, their sharp edges a stark reminder of a life I once believed would be mine forever.

Four years had elapsed since I was cast out, like a pariah, banished across the ocean to a place where my name held no significance, my sorrow even less.

....

When I was eight, after my parents perished in a devastating car crash, Walter Gonzalez, my father's closest friend, adopted me and raised me within the pack. He embodied everything an Alpha should be—powerful, commanding, and larger than life. To the rest of the pack, he was untouchable, revered. To me, he was both savior and guardian.

He raised me as if I were his daughter, yet I was always acutely aware of the chasm that separated us. He was Alpha, and I was merely a Beta, a late bloomer who didn't even undergo her first shift until well into adulthood. Still, despite our differences, he treated me with exceptional kindness and care, shielding me from the pack's inherent cruelty and its relentless expectations. And I cherished those moments, even as I felt the stirrings of a forbidden desire deep within my soul.

By the time I turned sixteen, that desire had morphed into something I could no longer suppress. I found myself seeking his company, yearning for his attention, his approval. I memorized the way his jaw tightened when he was displeased, the way his scent—a blend of pine, cedar, and a dark, almost dangerous note—permeated every room he occupied. I knew it was wrong, yet I couldn't restrain myself. He wasn't a blood relative; he wasn't even truly my uncle. So, why did it feel so forbidden?

When I turned eighteen, my entire world crumbled. A diary. A confession. One unforgivable mistake.

He found it hidden beneath my pillow. His gaze scanned the pages, my most intimate thoughts exposed before him. I reached out, desperate to explain, but then he met my eyes.

And in that instant, I realized—I had irrevocably lost him.

He made his decision swiftly: I had to leave. Within twenty-four hours, I was packed and on a plane to Europe, far removed from the Silver Moon Pack and the man who had once been the center of my universe.

Just as I was about to push open the heavy oak door of the packhouse, my phone vibrated in my pocket. Seeing ""Hubby"" displayed on the screen triggered an involuntary smile, and I answered the call.

""Naomi, we finalized the date for our marking ceremony. It's exactly one month from today. Have you decided whether you prefer it in New York or elsewhere in the States?""

The reassuring voice of Theodore Simmons, my fiancé and Beta of the Crimson Fang Pack, calmed my nerves. After a brief pause, I responded, ""In the States.""

""Understood, I'll start making the arrangements immediately."" His tone remained gentle, and after a beat, he added, ""Make sure you extend the invitation to Alpha Walter when you see him.""

""Of course,"" I replied sweetly, and after a few more exchanges, we reluctantly ended the call.

Initially, Europe presented a considerable challenge. The language barrier, the cultural differences. Life was difficult, and on several occasions, I found myself in perilous situations, narrowly escaping death during encounters with rogue wolves. In a moment of sheer desperation, I called Alpha Walter, hoping he would bring me home.

However, my calls went unanswered, and my messages vanished into the ether. If Theodore hadn't intervened to save me, I might have succumbed to one of those terrifying events.

As we got to know each other better, we discovered that we both came from influential packs, and our connection deepened from there. Over the next two years, Theodore's unwavering dedication won me over, and I accepted his proposal. Soon after graduation, he proposed, and I accepted without hesitation. It was around that time that Alpha Walter finally contacted me, permitting me to return to pay my respects to my parents.

I also returned to present him with an invitation and inform him that I was getting married.

Just as I was about to enter the packhouse, the door swung open from the inside.

""Well, well... look who decided to grace us with her presence."" It was Margo Weaver, my tormentor, my college nightmare.

""Delta Margo,"" I breathed, a knot tightening in my throat. How is she here? The thought echoed in my mind.

I blinked, and in a moment, a sense of recognition dawned on me as I recalled the familiarity concealed beneath her once-unfamiliar facade. A nightmare resurfaced, and old fears flooded over me, leaving my limbs stiff and my back clammy with dread. ""What are you doing here?""

Before I could process the situation further, Alpha Walter emerged from the doorway. Tall and imposing, he still projected the same commanding aura, his dominance as palpable as ever. Noticing my reaction, he frowned in disapproval. ""You should show more respect to Margo, my future Luna.""

Margo?!

""Why her? She once...""

The words about her bullying me hadn't even left my lips when Alpha Walter interrupted me. ""Once what?""

I remembered the past.

Life in Europe had been isolating at first. Desperately seeking solace, I looked for news of him, only to discover that he had found his mate, one he showered with the same affection he had once reserved for me. Fireworks illuminating the night sky on her birthday, 9,999 roses flown in for her, extravagant gestures at auctions—all the tenderness he had once directed towards me, now lavished on her.

I cried in solitude, enduring the searing pain, surviving each agonizing night, until I finally accepted that he loved another.

But what I never anticipated was that the person who had replaced me would be Margo, the very person who had bullied me relentlessly in school!

Seeing him stand by her side, defending her, I opened my mouth to speak, but ultimately shook my head, my voice barely audible. ""Nothing.""

""If there's nothing, come in. Appreciate this rare opportunity to return. Let go of past resentments. Your parents' anniversary is approaching; I will accompany you to pay our respects.""

""Margo is also moving in today. Settle in, and make an effort to get along with her.""

With that, he departed the packhouse with Margo in tow.

Watching them walk away, I could only manage a bitter smile.

After a long pause, I murmured softly to myself, ""There's no future for me here, Alpha Walter. Once I have paid my respects to my parents, I will leave for good.""

They returned in the evening, and it took until the dead of night to finish unloading their belongings. Clutching my wedding invitation, I stood outside Alpha Walter's room, mentally preparing myself before softly knocking on the door.

The door opened, not revealing Alpha Walter, but Margo.

Her smile dripped with malice. ""What's this? After all these years, have you come to reminisce?""

I froze as a flood of nightmarish memories resurfaced. Instinctively, I tried to retreat, but she seized my arm.

""I'm warning you, keep your mouth shut. Don't even think about revealing our past to Alpha Walter.""

Hearing her menacing tone, I suppressed my fear and retorted, ""Do you truly believe that your lies will remain hidden forever? Sooner or later, he will see your true colors.""

But Margo appeared unfazed. Instead, she grew even more smug. ""I could crush you then, and I can still crush you now.""

Before I could react, she grabbed a nearby cup of coffee and splashed it all over herself.

""Ah!""

As her shriek echoed through the air, Alpha Walter rushed out of his study, his face etched with panic. He cradled Margo in his arms as she feigned distress, tears streaming down her face. ""Alpha Walter, don't blame Naomi...""

""Naomi, I allowed you to return, believing you had moved on. I never imagined you would remain so stubborn. Let me remind you one last time; some things are impossible. No matter what schemes you concoct, you will never get what you desire!""

His harsh words clarified everything. He believed I had thrown the coffee at Margo out of jealousy?

I hastily began to explain, ""No, you misunderstand. I came to give you a wedding inv...""

But before I could finish, Alpha Walter carried Margo away.

Watching him leave, an overwhelming sadness washed over me. I let out a self-deprecating laugh, completing my sentence.

""I came to give you a wedding invitation. I've found someone who truly loves me. I'm getting married... and it's not to you.""

# Chapter 2 - Hospital Visit

The following morning, Walter Gonzalez, Alpha of the local pack, filled the room with his powerful presence. A tangible force radiated from him, a silent command that pressed against the very air. I, Naomi Fox, was just finishing my meager breakfast, steeling myself to explain the events of the previous day. But the words caught in my throat. Before I could utter a single syllable, he seized my wrist, his grip unyielding, and wordlessly ushered me out.

The sleek black car sliced through the frenetic energy of New York City. The urban landscape blurred past in a dizzying rush. Finally, the vehicle screeched to a halt before the imposing facade of City General Hospital. Walter Gonzalez only relinquished his hold on my wrist once we stood at Margo Weaver’s bedside. His voice, when it came, was a low, inflexible rumble.

""Apologize to Margo.""

I clamped my mouth shut, a stubborn line forming. Compliance was a foreign concept in this moment. My refusal manifested in the rigid set of my shoulders, the almost imperceptible tilt of my chin against the instinctive urge to submit. ""Why should I apologize for something I didn't instigate?""

I averted my gaze, unwilling to concede even the slightest fault. Disappointment flickered in Walter Gonzalez's eyes, a fleeting shadow that spoke volumes. An unspoken battle of wills raged between us, neither willing to yield an inch. It was Margo Weaver who ultimately intervened, her voice a saccharine melody laced with insincerity.

""Oh, poor Naomi,"" Margo cooed, her tone dripping with false concern. ""It’s such a shame how jealousy can consume someone so easily.”

""She's barely a year younger than you, Margo, and a grown woman. What's 'young' about that?"" Walter Gonzalez’s retort was sharp, the warmth in his expression abruptly extinguished. He fixed me with a piercing stare, his Alpha authority brooking no argument. ""Apologize. Now.""

The carefully constructed explanation I had prepared evaporated, scattering like dust in the wind. The hardened expression on his face told me that he had already passed judgment, declaring me guilty.

The apology snagged in my throat, choked by the weight of his disapproval. Those once-familiar eyes, which had held such adoration, now reflected only contempt. How swift and merciless the transition.

""Sorry."" The word was a hollow echo in the sterile room.

After what felt like an eternity of tense silence, I finally capitulated. Walter Gonzalez, however, didn’t appear triumphant. My abrupt shift in demeanor seemed to unsettle him.

I couldn’t bear to remain there, caught in the crossfire between them. I concocted a flimsy excuse to escape the suffocating atmosphere of the hospital room. ""I'm going to the restroom.""

The icy water splashing against my skin offered a momentary reprieve from the turmoil within. I stared at my reflection in the mirror, pressing my lips together in a tight line.

People invariably favor those they cherish, and Walter Gonzalez was no exception. Just as he had favored me, he now favored Delta Margo Weaver.

That's acceptable.

With that thought firmly in place, I turned and walked toward the door. As I approached, I noticed him standing nearby, a silent sentinel waiting for my return.

Just as I was about to pass him, Walter Gonzalez broke the silence. ""Margo is craving a sandwich from Ralph's Deli. I need to stay here with her, so would you mind going to get it?""

I paused, the question hanging in the air. After a beat, I agreed.

As we brushed past each other, his voice, laced with an undercurrent of something unsaid, reached me again. ""I'm going to mark Margo. It's best if you relinquish those… feelings.”

Hearing those words, I faltered but didn’t turn around. ""Don't worry. I already have. In a month, I'll…""

""I hope you mean that."" Walter Gonzalez cut me off before I could finish, his tone clipped. He turned and strode away.

I hadn’t gone far when I suddenly called out after him. “Do you really care for Margo that deeply? We’re the same age. If she’s worthy, why am I not?”

""Yes."" Walter Gonzalez turned back, his gaze a sharp warning. ""Anyone else is worthy, just not you! Don't ever mention it again.”

I nodded, acknowledging his command. ""Understood. I won’t.""

The afternoon descended into a cruel charade of errands, each delivery met with a fresh demand. Ralph's Deli, Bailey's Bakery – I traversed the city countless times, each return punctuated by Margo Weaver’s carefully calculated dismissals.

Breathless, I delivered the requested sandwich to Margo. But after a single, disdainful bite, she tossed it into the trash. ""The sandwich is stone cold. It's inedible. Never mind, Naomi. Could you perhaps fetch me a cupcake from Bailey's Bakery?""

Without a word, I turned, my gaze locking with Walter Gonzalez's. After a fleeting moment, I nodded. ""Very well.""

Bailey’s Bakery was geographically closer to the hospital than Ralph’s Deli, but no less a trial. When I finally returned, Margo again took only a small bite before rejecting it. ""Oh dear, I completely forgot to mention… I simply loathe this flavor.""

And so, I ran back and forth throughout the long afternoon until she finally ceased her fault-finding.

Thankfully, after that exhausting day, Walter Gonzalez didn’t request my presence back at the hospital. I assiduously avoided the place, thereby also avoiding Margo Weaver's torment.

That is, until I was fully recovered, and the day I was discharged. No sooner had I arrived home than a knock echoed through my small apartment.

""There's a reunion gathering,"" Margo announced, entwining her arm possessively around Walter Gonzalez’s. Her smile held a subtle hint of malice. ""You are coming, aren't you, Naomi?""

Walter Gonzalez, seemingly caught in the undertow of her machinations, appeared slightly uncomfortable but offered no resistance. Instead, he gazed at her with a fond expression. When he turned to me, however, the warmth vanished, replaced by a cold, resolute statement. ""Margo is thinking of your well-being. Don't make things difficult for her, Naomi.”

I forced a smile, suppressing the bubbling bitterness and self-derision, and offered a clipped nod of agreement.

# Chapter 3 - Crimson Shadows

The ""Crimson Night,"" New York's most elite haven for supernatural beings, throbbed with the rhythm of neon. Margo Weaver's entrance, escorted by Alpha Walter Gonzalez, sent ripples of excitement through the room, a stark contrast to my own unnoticed arrival.

Truthfully, the anonymity was a gift.

I chose a secluded corner, my gaze drawn to Margo as she soaked up the attention, Alpha Walter attending to her every need. He signaled for her preferred cocktail, gently placed his jacket around her shoulders when she shivered, and declared, his deep voice resonating through the room, ""Tonight, the celebrations are on me, in honor of my future Luna.""

Murmurs of envy rippled through the gathering.

""Did you see the way he looks at her? Like she's his entire world…""

""Who would have imagined the Ice Alpha capable of such tenderness?""

""They say he turned away his own Beta for her – that girl who used to be always by his side…""

""I always perceived Alpha Walter as somewhat cold in public, but witnessing this, it becomes apparent that even the most reserved individuals can display affection towards those they cherish.""

""Exactly. Any sighting of Margo and Alpha Walter together invariably makes the headlines. I aspire to find a connection like that.""

In the midst of the buzz, someone bravely inquired, ""Margo, your love with Alpha Walter is so inspiring. Any plans for the marking ceremony? We're expecting invitations!""

Margo blushed prettily, playfully tugging at Alpha Walter's sleeve. His eyes flickered towards me for a fleeting moment, but seeing me calmly nursing my drink, he quickly returned his focus to her with a loving smile.

""Soon. We’ve already begun to plan it.""

A chorus of cheers and well-wishes erupted.

Suddenly, a suggestion for a game was voiced, and I found myself pulled into the circle, along with calls for Alpha Walter to join.

I hesitated. ""Alpha Walter isn’t usually one for games.""

But Margo turned to him, her eyes pleading. ""Oh, come on, Walter. Just this once, for me? It's so much more fun with everyone.""

Succumbing to her charm, Alpha Walter agreed.

The first round concluded with Alpha Walter drawing the short straw. He flipped a penalty card that commanded: ""Kiss someone of the opposite sex for a full minute.”

Margo's cheeks flushed even deeper, and without a second's hesitation, Alpha Walter enveloped her in a passionate kiss, met by the roaring approval of the onlookers.

There was a time when a scene like this would have been painful, but I had moved on. Instead, I clapped along with the crowd, my smile genuine.

The minute sped by, and the following round saw me on the losing end. This time, the challenge involved revealing the top contact in my phone.

Without a second thought, I displayed my contacts, and instantly everyone noticed the entry at the top—Mate?!

A surprised gasp rippled through the group. ""Naomi, are you mated? Why haven't you said anything?""

I offered a smile. ""It's recent. You'll all receive invitations to the marking ceremony.""

As I slipped my phone away, my eyes briefly met Alpha Walter's. His gaze was intense, yet he remained silent.

Later, on my way to the ladies' room, I unexpectedly encountered Alpha Walter in the corridor, his expression icy.

""You dare to trivialize the sacred bond?” The wall behind me cracked, evidence of his barely controlled power. ""Prove it. Call him. Now.""

My fingers trembled slightly as I dialed the number. After several unanswered rings, the call diverted to voicemail.

""There's a time zone difference. He could be asleep,"" I offered truthfully.

Alpha Walter scoffed, ""Once a lie is revealed, there's no point in prolonging it. It only makes you look foolish. Naomi, stop with the charade.”

With that, he turned and strode away.

As Alpha Walter vanished down the hallway, my phone buzzed—Theodore Simmons, my Beta, was calling.

I answered, his voice warm with sleep.

""Sorry, Naomi. I was napping. What's up?""

Watching Alpha Walter's retreating figure, I sighed softly. Now wasn't the time for explanations.

I shook my head. ""Nothing, sorry to wake you.”

Theodore's voice was gentle, ""Naomi, you could never disturb me, no matter the time.”

""Oh, and the marking ceremony plans are coming together. You mentioned designing your own dress, right? Do you want it for the ceremony?”

I hesitated momentarily but then nodded. ""Yes.”

The next day, I went downstairs, but neither Alpha Walter nor Margo were around. I grabbed a quick breakfast and made my way to the bridal shop alone.

The pristine white marking dress hung silently on the mannequin as I carefully took it down and slipped it on. Gazing at my reflection in the full-length mirror, I felt a surge of nostalgia.

Years ago, I had poured my heart and soul into designing this dress, dreaming of the day I would wear it to mark Alpha Walter. Now I wore it again, but to mark someone else.

""Naomi?""

# Chapter 4 - The Dress and the Dismissal

A voice, laced with familiarity and a hint of disdain, sliced through the air behind me. I pivoted, my eyes landing on Margo Weaver and Alpha Walter Gonzalez, their expressions a cocktail of surprise and something akin to…

The point is that comparing oneself to others can diminish happiness and joy. Intellectually, I can get behind The Old Bull Moose on this. Emotionally, I continue to do this even though I know it isn’t helpful. How often do you find yourself doing the same?  

# The Social Media Mirage: What Are We Comparing Ourselves To?

In the investment management world, if you want to know “how you’re doing,” you compare yourself against a benchmark. For the comparison to have any meaning, the benchmark needs to be comparable to how *you’re* invested. When we examine our financial situation against that of others, it’s incredibly easy to contrast our reality with someone else’s *image* rather than their *reality*.

Social media enables people to carefully curate their online image. You’ve seen it: a shiny car, a huge home, and an extravagant vacation. It’s easy to assume that everyone else is thriving financially while you’re struggling. We may lack context. There could be a meaningful amount of anxiety and stress lurking behind those posts. Perhaps that vacation was paid for with a credit card. Maybe that new home left someone up to their eyeballs in mortgage debt. Most people don’t go out of their way to share financial struggles. Comparison here might not only be unfair (to yourself), but it might not be grounded in reality.

**Why Do We Compare and What Does It Cost Us?**

The intellectual part of me understands the trouble with making comparisons; however, the emotional part of me is all about the comps. The “benchmarking” mindset is probably second nature for me, given my profession. Sometimes I ask Google questions like:

·         What is the average income for someone like me?

·         How much retirement savings should I have?

·         What’s an average amount of debt?

In my case, I suppose I do this to gauge whether I'm doing okay or if I’m normal. Maybe the same is true for you. The more I learn about myself, the more I realize that there is a cost to this way of thinking. I’m more inclined to focus on what I lack. In addition to the anxiety and feeling of low self-worth, I occasionally find myself slipping into envy and jealousy. A lack of contentment can sow the seeds of bitterness. Maybe this is what Teddy had in mind.

**An Attempt to Break The Cycle**

I’m not sure I have any words of wisdom on how best to overcome this issue. Two things I am going to attempt to do going forward:

1.      Limit social media. I don’t spend much time on social media as it is, but I can’t see a downside to scaling down even more.  

2.      Be intentional about practicing gratitude. My Dad battled cancer for the last six or seven years of his life. Whenever I would ask him how he was doing, he would respond with something positive. A typical response was “I’m on the right side of the dirt my boy” or “I’m in pretty good shape for the shape I’m in.” In this moment, I can acknowledge that there is much to be grateful for: a roof over my head, a job where my good days outnumber my bad days and the ability to save a little each month, even though it does require us to pinch a penny here and there seriously. The trick will be to maintain this mindset when I am beset with self-doubt and anxiety.

**The Bottom Line**

At the end of the day the only comparison that genuinely matters is the one with yourself. Are you doing better than you were yesterday, last month, or last year? If the answer is yes, you’re on the right track.

I write this as much for myself as for anyone else who might stumble across this post.

P.S. I love coffee. So did Theodore Roosevelt. His coffee consumption has become the stuff of lore and is likely to have been greatly exaggerated.

Here I am, grasping at the appropriate words, trying to capture how your smile drives me crazy in the most maddening, beaufiful way. It’s not just charm—it’s a current that moves through the room and tangles me in it before I even realize I’m caught.

Some days, I swear I can feel the longing behind your eyes—thick as summer air before a storm. So thick. So palpable. Tension that could be sliced with scissors, and still spill over.

And yet, other days… you feel cold. Distant.
Like you’ve built a wall just high enough to keep me from believing too much. It snaps me out of my delusions. It hurtles me back to reality. It reminds me that I’m alone in this—that my feelings might not be returned, and all of this might live only inside me.

It’s taken ages to put this mess of thoughts into something resembling a letter—because how do you confess to someone who hasn’t asked? How do you confide in someone who may never?

Oh, the pangs of unrequited love.

There are secrets behind the smile that lights up the dullest day. Your eyes twinkle in a way that makes me believe—for just a moment—that you feel it too. I catch the way you glance at me when you think I’m not looking, and my heart plays tricks on itself.

You’re so particular. About your routines, your coffee, your boundaries, your silence.

And I’m so particular… about you.

I never knew what it meant for someone to make my heart skip a beat until you darkened my doorway, only to leave a little light behind you. The way I feel about you is intoxicating—almost suffocating, really. A soft ache, dressed up like hope.

You may never know this. Or maybe, just maybe, you do?",13,1751571666.0,LoveLetters,2,1.0,False

1lqyu8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lqyu8a/sp_white_to_move/,[SP] White to Move,"It was the worst storm Alex had ever seen. Sheets of rain plummeting from the sky, hammering the windshield. “And now I’m driving in it,” she thought, knuckles white from the grip on the wheel.  A college professor by trade, she was heading to the annual symposium of mathematics. It’s normally held in San Francisco, but because of the dismal enrollment  numbers this year, the symposium had to be moved to a coastal town in  Maine; it was a much cheaper option for the university. This was good for her. That meant no plane hassle, no TSA, and no “middle seat purgatory.” Just a drive through New England - rain or not. 

But this storm? It wasn’t any regular storm. She could barely see the winding road ahead, and to top it all off, the GPS kept rerouting itself. “Worthless technology,” she muttered. 

She should have slowed down or pulled over, but the eagerness to share was too strong.  For the first time in probably decades, she had something important to share: proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, the “holy grail” of unsolved mathematics problems - undone by a professor with a blackboard and an excessive amount of coffee. This would change the entire trajectory of her life.

The headlights, in their attempt to cut through the rain and darkness, caught a flicker of movement. 

A lone deer. Broadside in the center of the road. She tried desperately to swerve, barely missing the deer, but not the guard rail.  She heard, with perfect clarity, the screaming tires, the crunching  metal and the shattering  glass. Then, darkness. 

She woke inside the crashed car. The rain doing its best to wash away the blood all over her face, the world slightly fading in and out of focus. The car was totaled and the road behind was invisible in the storm. 

In the distance, not too far, a beacon of hope - a lighthouse. “Was that always there?” she asked,  then started toward the lighthouse: A safe, warm, dry place to call for help. 

A short while later (though it seemed like an eternity walking through the downpour), Alex arrived at the lighthouse. 

The door easily pushed open and she cautiously looked around. Wet clothes dripping on the old, wooden floor.  There was a well-worn wood burning heater that kept the chill out of the air. It wasn’t warm, per se, but it was at least dry. A man was sitting at a table in front of a chessboard, dimly lit by the kerosene lamp nearby. He wore a wine-colored sweater.  He was old. Not ancient, but old. His posture seemed to say that he had been sitting there for a while. Days, maybe weeks. 

“E-excuse me,” her words barely falling from her mouth, “I was in an accident. Do you have a phone I can use?”

“No phones here. The lines out here always go down with the storms,” the old man replied. 

“Is there a radio or anything I can use? My cell phone got destroyed in the accident,” she said. 

“Closest radio is two miles up the road at the Coast Guard station.” The man gestured to Alex to sit, “You’re here now. Why don’t you stay a while and dry off?” asked the old man. “Can’t get anywhere else during this storm anyway.”

Alex didn’t move. “I just need to call someone.”

“You’ll get there,” the man interjected, “but you’re here now.” He leaned forward and straightened the pieces on the board. “You play?” he asked. 

“When I was younger. I haven’t played in years,” she replied. 

“White to move,” said the man as he gestured again toward the chair across from him. 

She sat down and stared at the board for a bit. “I’m Alex. What’s your name?” extending a hand for a shake. 

“You can call me Charles,” the man replied with a slight smile, grasping her hand firmly. “It’s nice to meet you.”

Alex played the first move.

“It’s interesting to me how chess matches always start the exact same way, but never repeat. Infinite variety from a single beginning,” said Charles as he played his first move. 

Alex surveyed the board before moving a knight. “That’s the illusion, isn’t it? Order at the onset leads one to believe they know the destination.”

“And what destination is that?” Asked Charles, never looking up from the board.  

“Success I guess? Happiness?” Alex answered. 

“Aren’t those relative terms?” Charles replied as he moved another pawn. 

Alex thought for a second before bringing a bishop into play. “Yes, but they’re still what we aim for. Even if they’re different versions of the same thing.”  

“And are you close to your version?” Charles moved his bishop, never removing his eyes from the board. His tone wasn’t aggressive or rude, but the question landed heavy all the same. 

“I thought I was. I proved something big. Something important.”  Alex moved the other knight. “Then I realized I had nobody to share it with.” 

Charles nodded and moved his piece quickly, as if he had played this exact match before. “Many people mistake significance for connection,” he said.  “They are not the same. Yet most people who come here talk more about their achievements and their work than the people in their lives.”

“I don’t exactly have a fan club,” she said, “I guess I figured that would come after the achievements.” She moved another pawn. 

Charles moved another pawn in response. “You’re playing like someone who’s afraid to commit to the center.”

Alex snickered. “Maybe I’m just tired of opening strong and watching it all fall apart in the end game.” The clock kept ticking as she took a moment to survey the board. “It’s already midnight?!” She thought as she mirrored his move. 

His gaze lifted from the board and focused on her. “There is a difference in playing to win and playing not to lose,” he said. 

She looked at him. His eyes were dark, almost shark-like. She hadn’t noticed how dark they were until just now. Like staring into an endless abyss. “Which one do you think I’m doing?” she retorted, somewhat defensively. 

He gestured to the board. “You’ve mirrored every one of my pawn moves.”

Astonished, Alex murmured, “I didn’t even realize I did that.”

He gave a faint smile. “Most don’t. Habit is a powerful thing, especially when you’ve been playing alone for so long.” Charles castled king side. 

“I used to think I liked being alone. Late nights at the blackboard, coffee getting cold. Lately it feels like I stopped talking and nobody even cares.” 

Alex glanced at the clock again. Midnight. The second hand was ticking away, but the other hands didn’t move. Surely at least a minute had passed.

She castled king side too. Across the room, she saw a small window that offered a minimal view of the storm. But it wasn’t the storm that caught her eye - it was her reflection.

For a moment, it didn’t move with her. Like it was on some sort of time delay or that it forgot what it was supposed to be doing. She noticed that the reflection’s expression was slightly different than her own. It was the eyes. They seemed older than hers and held a weariness she hadn’t noticed on first glance. Alex wasn’t sure who was real, her or the image.  She blinked and turned away. 

“Is that clock broken?” She asked him. 

Focused again on the board, Charles moved a knight “It works as well as it needs to.”

She stared at the clock for a little longer. “The second hand keeps ticking away but the other hands don’t move.” She moved her knight again. 

Charles finally looked up and said, “Maybe time works differently when you’re not in a hurry,” moving his bishop into an attacking position. 

Alex gave a forced laugh and said, “That’s not how clocks work,” then moved another piece.

“No?” replied Charles. “Then what is the measure of time? The hands on a clock or the feeling that something is passing?”

Alex just rubbed her temple, unsure if the fatigue was from the crash or something else entirely. It was her turn. Again. “Wasn’t it just my turn?” she thought as they moved the queen to a more advantageous position. 

“You’ve spoken more about your work than any person or relationship in your life,” he said. 

“Work is what stayed”

“And what did you let go?”

She paused for a while, “Everyone. I never made space for any of them. My work consumed me and my relationships suffered for it.”

She noticed something odd and asked, “Was that portrait there before?” 

Charles, without looking up from the board, replied, “Of course it was. Everything in this room has always been here.”

“I feel like that portrait is new. Or maybe different somehow?” She studied it for a minute, trying to make sense of what she saw. “I could have sworn the eyes moved and looked at me.”

“It’s probably the light just playing tricks on you. It likes to do that here.”

Alex, feeling a little unsettled, decided to confront Charles. “What is this place? Something weird is going on,” she said. “First  the clock won’t move, then my reflection wasn’t following me, then my chess pieces weren’t where I put them, and now this mysterious portrait?! What’s going on here?”

“Things blur here. Memory, time, direction.” He tapped the chessboard. “This is the only thing that keeps its shape.”

Feeling more unsettled, she stated,  “You said this keeps its shape but I swear I moved that bishop two turns ago.”

Charles didn’t look up. “And yet here it is: exactly where it’s supposed to be. 

Alex stared at the piece, now resting exactly where it had started. “So you’re telling me I imagined this?!”

He smiled faintly. “I’m telling you this place lets you remember what you need and forget what you’re not ready for.” Charles moved a piece. “Check.”

Alex moved a piece to protect her king. “This is too weird. I’m sorry but I can’t finish this game. I need to be getting to the Coast Guard station so I can get some help.” 

She stood up, scraping the chair against the old wooden floor and walked to the door. She burst through the door only to find that she was still in the lighthouse. “The door just led me back into this room again!  LET ME OUT! I need to go get help!”

Calmly, Charles gestured to the seat across from him. “I will help you get where you need to be as soon as we finish the game. Please? It’s your move.”

Reluctantly, she sat back down and moved the queen. 

“All the moves you made have led you to this moment.” 

“All my moves have led me…here? What does that even mean?!” 

Charles moved his piece into position.  “Checkmate.”

The board began to fade along with the room around it. Then Alex was outside. The storm raged, but she was somehow dry. Ahead, the car was crumpled up against the railing like an aluminum can, headlights still illuminating the berm. 

Charles stood beside her now, waiting silently. 

She walked slowly to the driver’s side. The broken glass littering the ground. Pieces of plastic and metal strewn about. She looked inside and saw the body. And the face. It was a face she had seen a million times - her own. 

“No. I got out. I walked to the lighthouse.”

Charles watched silently. 

“I was supposed to present… I was going to show them I mattered…”

Her voice cracked. The weight of it all - the isolation, the late nights alone, the drive, the mathematical proof, the years of silence - pressed in from all sides. 

“So what is this? Purgatory?”

“Something like that,” Charles responded. “A place between one move and the next.”

“So this is it? Checkmate?” she asked disappointedly. 

“Yes, but you know what happens after checkmate don’t you?” he asked. 

She looked at him, perplexed. 

“A new game,” said Charles as he touched her forehead.

When I would ask him to buy decaf coffee, he would buy Cafe Bustelo (espresso) instead. Each time I would speak up and he would ignore me.

Edit: I really struggle to identify abuse because I don't have a name for the tactic that's happened.

It's like feederism, but nothing is inherently sexual gratifying about it and at one point, an abuser is just trying to kill someone without directly killing them (though this feels like a really hard accusation to make even in a general sense, unfortunately one of the consequences is death for me specifically)",2,1751571600.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

By C.S. Lewis","Norah Jackson, trapped in a loveless marriage to an elderly husband, finds herself entangled in a dangerous game of seduction with her stepson, Quinn Jackson. As she schemes to secure her future by manipulating Quinn for his inheritance, she begins to uncover his hidden obsession with her. What starts as a calculated plan spirals into a twisted web of desire, betrayal, and forbidden emotions that neither can escape......

# Chapter 1 - My Stepson's Secret Obsession

""Stepson,"" I drawled, my voice dripping with a feigned languor as I watched my coffee topple, spreading a dark stain across the pristine floor. ""My back's acting up, and bending over is out of the question. Be a dear and clean that up, would you?""

Quinn Jackson, my stepson and infuriatingly, my age peer, flicked a glance at the lipstick mark I'd indicated with a manicured nail. He moved with that annoyingly graceful stride of his, crouching down near my legs, right by the edge of the sofa.

I was showcasing my assets in a figure-hugging skirt that skimmed just below my knees today. A strategic choice, of course.

As he leaned closer, I felt the whisper of his breath against my bare calf, a sudden chill prickling my skin. I forced myself to remain indifferent.

They say Quinn has always been harboring a secret crush on me.

They whisper that in moments like these, his suppressed desire is practically screaming, his body language giving him away.

But when I actually bothered to look at him, he was already smoothly handing me the lipstick-stained napkin and settling back into his armchair, burying himself in his newspaper.

Desire, huh? Didn't seem like it.

With a dismissive shrug, I decided a strategic retreat to the bedroom was in order for a ""nap.""

But then, from the corner of my eye, I caught Quinn subtly shifting in his seat. His legs crossed at an odd angle, and he leaned slightly to his left – as if desperately trying to conceal something.

...Interesting.

\[Attention: This is a story of awakening—a young housewife ready to seize control of her destiny. Her plan? To secure her future by claiming her stepson—and with him, the fortune that rightfully belongs to her ailing husband’s legacy.\]

\-----

I tied the knot with a man old enough to be my great-grandfather, a complete bore.

Finally, it looked like he was kicking the bucket soon, but he was planning on leaving everything to his precious eldest son Quinn, my stepson. Absolutely not! In a moment of desperation, I posted an online ad offering a substantial reward for anyone who could provide me with an heir, hoping to influence the inheritance in my favor by falling pregnant.

But just then, I noticed a stream of comments hovering in my vision.

\[""Isn't she pathetic? The perfect candidate is right in front of her.""\]

\[""Hasn't she noticed the way her stepson's eyes practically undress her?""\]

\[""Stepmom, step away from the disaster button! This villainess is about to unleash chaos!""\]

\[""Writer, please give this shameless hussy what she deserves!""\]

\[""Haha, I'm here for the scandalous twisty basement scenes\~""\]

I froze, startled, and shot a glance at my stepson, who had always been so impeccably polite and reserved.

""Stepmother, is something troubling you?"" The young man inquired with an unsettlingly warm smile.

I snapped back to reality. ""Huh? Oh, it's nothing,"" I stammered, forcing myself to break eye contact.

After a moment, I risked another peek in his direction. The comments were still there, multiplied now.

\[""Seriously, who would come up with such a ridiculous plan?""\]

\[""Honestly, shouldn't she be focusing on seducing the stepson instead of advertising for a baby daddy?""\]

\[""Writer, just off her already! I'm getting secondhand embarrassment.""\]

\[""Haha, I'm loving this train wreck. Watching a beautiful idiot get played by her seemingly innocent yet secretly manipulative stepson is pure gold.""\]

\[""Living under the same roof for seven years and still clueless about Quinn's feelings? She needs glasses... or a brain!""\]

I thought, ""…""

I honestly hadn't noticed.

Despite my husband's numerous flaws, he’d clearly done something right with his son. Quinn seemed almost too good to be true. At twenty-two, while most people are still sponging off their parents, he had already earned a master's degree and started taking over the company.

Elegant, courteous, and composed – that was what people said about him.

In our interactions, he never once stepped out of line.

For example, after asking if I was alright and hearing my standard ""I'm fine"" reply, he didn't press any further, even when he caught me staring at him again. He simply allowed it, remaining engrossed in his laptop behind his stylish glasses. His profile was striking, and his calm demeanor gave him an air of detached sophistication that made him stand out in this vapid world.

Could such a well-behaved man actually harbor desires for his stepmother?

No. It had to be my imagination running wild from too many late-night dramas.

I dismissed those floating comments with a determined huff.

But what if, just what if, there was a grain of truth to them?

# Chapter 2 - Accidental Thigh Touch

\[He was hauling enough stuff to fill a couple of those giant reusable bags from Whole Foods.\]

Quinn Jackson was practically flexing as he turned his head, making sure his jawline was on full display for his stepmother.

And knowing him, he was probably already plotting something.

I'd bet a king-size bag of Doritos he was online, frantically searching, ""Can stepmothers contest a will?""

Ah, family. Ain't it grand? Hahaha...

Okay, deep breaths.

I could feel my blood starting to simmer.

Time to see what we're working with here.

My gaze swept across the living room, finally settling on my favorite shade of red lipstick.

Feigning a reach for my coffee cup, I clumsily knocked the lipstick onto the hardwood floor. ""Quinn Jackson,"" I called out.

He looked up from his laptop, those annoyingly perfect eyebrows raised in anticipation.

""My neck's a bit stiff today; wouldn't you mind grabbing that for me? I can't really bend down.""

Quinn Jackson followed my pointed finger to the lipstick, and for a split second, that ever-present smirk flickered.

""Sadie—""

I cut him off smoothly. ""Don't bother Sadie Wood. You're right there, and by the time she gets over here, you'll have already saved the day.""

If Quinn Jackson refused now, it would definitely raise suspicions.

Our eyes met for a brief, charged moment.

He gave a barely perceptible nod. ""Fine.""

He unfolded his long frame from the armchair, strolled over, crouched low, and reached for the fallen lipstick near my legs and the edge of the sofa.

I'd chosen a pencil skirt today, a classic black number that hit just at the knees.

As he moved closer, I could feel the faint warmth of his breath against my bare calf, sending a tiny shiver dancing up my spine.

Stay cool, Evangeline. Stay cool.

My inner monologue went wild:

\[Hold up, is he trying to score points with the stepmom?\]

\[""From his vantage point, all he sees is a glimpse of pale skin, the hemline showcasing sculpted calves and delicate ankles. Like a marble statue come to life...""\]

Wow, even from the antagonist's perspective, I can see the appeal of Norah Jackson!\]

\[I'm half expecting him to get even closer.\]

\[It's happening. This is totally happening.\]

\[Someone's about to discreetly cross their legs\~\]

""Norah.""

His voice, low and smooth, jolted me back to reality.

I accepted the lipstick from his outstretched hand, my tongue darting out for a quick, almost imperceptible thank you. ""Thanks, Quinn Jackson.""

""You're welcome.""

He flashed that infuriatingly charming smile and went back to his seat, resuming his browsing.

And not a single sign of embarrassment. No flushed cheeks, no tell-tale redness creeping up his neck.

Like he'd simply picked up a pen, completely unfazed by the underlying tension.

What was that all about?

He was totally messing with me.

Maybe I secretly hoped for something to happen, so I wasn't as disappointed.

It was all just a bit of fun.

After all these years, if anyone knows Quinn Jackson, it's me.

What made me even entertain those ridiculous thoughts?

Feeling strangely unaffected, I decided to retreat to the bedroom for a nap.

But then, from the corner of my eye, I caught Quinn Jackson subtly shifting his position, crossing his legs.

He even leaned slightly to the side, as if trying to hide something.

...Huh?

# Chapter 3 - Stepmom's Got a Plot Twist

""I can't believe those chat commenters were right; Quinn Jackson really is sitting like \*that\*, haha!""

""Norah Jackson, you better haul yourself upstairs, pronto. Our dear Quinn Jackson is in dire need of a cold shower, stat.""

""Let's be precise, shall we? He needs to 'get' upstairs \*and then\* 'take' a cold shower. Two distinct actions, people.""

""Brace yourselves; expecting some grade-A, premium-level crazy today.""

...

And to think I almost dismissed those comments as utter rubbish! Turns out, they're disturbingly accurate.

Just to be absolutely sure it wasn't a fluke, I engineered a few more ""accidental"" opportunities to observe. Each time, the pearls of wisdom dropped in the comments became even more incisive, more eerily on point. Finally, I had to concede: Quinn Jackson is a walking, talking surprise package – like an Ikea flatpack with a hidden compartment full of extra, completely unnecessary screws.

Through these bite-sized nuggets of information, delivered courtesy of the internet's peanut gallery, I stumbled upon a truly earth-shattering revelation. Apparently, the world I inhabit is nothing more than a poorly written novel.

Quinn Jackson is the designated Big Bad, the primary antagonist.

And me? Well, I'm his tragically clueless stepmother, destined to make a series of spectacularly bad decisions that ultimately pave the way for his villainous transformation, before I'm unceremoniously written out of the story.

When I first read that, I had… thoughts. A lot of them.

Seven years. Does anyone have the slightest inkling of what these past seven years have been like for me?

Day in, day out, pretending to care for an ancient husband who could easily double as my grandfather, his skin resembling cracked tree bark, all while eagerly counting down the seconds until I could finally claim a substantial ""emotional distress"" windfall upon his inevitable demise.

And just when my long-awaited dream was about to materialize, the old fossil announces, with a dramatic cough, that he's leaving his entire fortune to his precious son, Quinn Jackson. All \*I\* get is the distinct honor of scattering his ashes.

Ha.

Who even cares about two pounds of powdered bone?

Can you even sell that for anything?

I was beyond furious, teetering on the edge of a complete meltdown at the prospect of ending up penniless.

Then, as if by divine intervention, I stumbled upon a trending news article: 【Woman receives five hundred million in alimony after getting pregnant out of wedlock】.

Maybe, just \*maybe\*, the same tactic could work for me?

I decided to gamble on it. After all, the old man's too far gone to know any better, and who's to say whose kid it is, really? I just needed to get my hands on that money first.

But before I could even begin to put my plan into motion, fate intervened, revealing that my original approach was utterly pointless.

It revealed a much simpler, far more efficient, and infinitely more reliable solution.

# Chapter 4 - The Accidental Seduction

I end up going to the bathroom like 5 times a day AT LEAST and get a headache by the afternoon. Today, I experienced brain fog symptoms and just felt so off. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I'm thinking of switching back to the Starbucks brand because I wasn't experiencing these feelings with their coffee. ",0,1751571568.0,nespresso,2,0.5,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1loofpf/amalfi_monte_carlo_bali_maldives_for_honeymoon/

Essentially after that thread and doing my research on reddit, because of our timing (see below please), Europe destinations were cut out, even though it seemed like a great fit. I would appreciate it if you can provide insight on the best destination(s) from the above, given:

1. We have two weeks (including travel time) being last week of Feb/first week of March

2. We both NEED really, really, really good food, cleanliness and excellent service! These are paramount for us. Oh, huge coffee fans and we love to explore any and every coffee shops and just chat away.

3. We DO WANT to relax as we'll be going right after the wedding BUT... not too much...Meaning, both of us would get pretty bored after say 3-4 days of being just at a tropical beach, doing nothing/having nothing to do (unless of course they food is freaking amazing!) We also don't really try to stay in the sun a lot a lot, but we don't mind if there are really cool water/beach things to do (surfing, snorkeling, beach volleyball with other people) but not anything extreme water activities wise as we both have a fear of deep ocean water.

Essentially, we like to dress up, go out, get coffee, explore things in cities/shopping/museums, then explore bougee restaurants/lounges/bars to get amazing food, and then sometimes head to da clubs etc etc, then come back and relax lol
From my research:

1. Maldives was suggested for the complete relaxation spots, but I read the food in Maldives is ""meh"" so that is a pretty big blow to it, not matter how much of an experience it may be. Therefore, we would pair it up with Dubai at seems exotic to us (but the sub doesn't seem to like it lol) Like we would really like a desert excursion on Camels we feel but then come back to a bustling city, ready to go out.

2. I came across Zighy Bay and it also seems exotic and I read the food is amazing!

3. Carribean (St. Lucia, St. Barths, Turks and Caicos) was also suggested as having more things to do compared to Maldives.

4. I threw in Argentina because perhaps, just assuming, Buenos Aires may offer that ""bougee"" vibe of exploring a city, shopping, restaurants/lounges etc with, hopefully, amazing food, and then you can also relax at a 5 star after all of the exploring.

5. South Africa seems like it may check all the boxes because I read the food is amazing, plus you can get the relaxation at a 5 star in Cape Town,

6. Bora Bora I read was one of the most beautiful places to go (even compared to Maldives!)

So what would be the best options given these and if there are others, please let me know! Thank you again in advance!!!",1,1751571536.0,honeymoonplanning,1,1.0,False

By Aria Wren","Madilyn Lawrence, a fiercely independent woman, devoted seven years to helping her fiancé, Stanley Griffin, build his empire. But when he falls for her serene sister, Lottie, Madilyn’s world shatters. She walks away, focusing on her career with her loyal team. Just as her new venture thrives, Stanley’s company crumbles, and he returns, begging for a second chance. Meanwhile, Brycen Elliott, her childhood friend and former fiancé, reenters her life, offering support and reigniting old bonds...

# Chapter 1 - ""From Ashes to Rivalry""

Stanley Griffin, my fiancé, fell in love with my sister, claiming she was gentle and serene, unlike my fiery and headstrong nature.

I laughed. He seemed to forget that it was precisely my fiery and headstrong personality that helped him rise from the ashes and manage a corporation of thousands.

At a gathering, he got drunk and confided in his friends, ""I want to follow my heart and pursue what I truly love, not settle for a lifetime with Madilyn Lawrence.""

Later, I let him go, allowing him to chase his true love.

Meanwhile, I started over with my trusted team, pouring my heart into my career.

He seemed to regret it. Seeing his company in shambles and his once-beloved now just a shadow of her former self, he begged me for another chance.

==============================

Stanley Griffin came to my office while I was in a meeting.

My team tactfully left the room.

I smirked,

""What, didn’t you go after your true love?""

He opened his mouth but ultimately said nothing.

""Madilyn, I was drunk that night, you…""

I cut him off impatiently, ""What you do is none of my concern.""

I had been devoted to Stanley for seven years, making his company my priority, his moods my compass.

Yet, I still ended up being his second choice.

Watching him struggle to retort but hold back gave me immense satisfaction.

A month ago, it was Lottie Russell who mocked me in front of him:

""Sister, how could you not even keep your own fiancé?""

At that time, Stanley gently held her, as if she were the most precious treasure in the world, and whispered softly,

""How could she ever compare to you?""

==============================

For seven years, Stanley had been hot and cold with me.

Even though I stuck to him like glue, he remained indifferent.

I would wait at home with dinner ready, sometimes until two or three in the morning.

He would come home reeking of alcohol, his breath tinged with the faint smell of tobacco.

His rough kisses would land on my ear, collarbone, and further down…

I closed my eyes, my lashes fluttering, feeling his presence.

Only in those moments would he come close to me.

The next morning, the other side of the bed would be cold, as if he had never been there.

I laughed at myself. Back then, I was so naive to think that my companionship could warm his heart.

While I was foolishly waiting,

He was living out the dream I could never attain with Lottie.

I was such a fool, silent and blind.

==============================

Now, the only thing I feel grateful for is that,

During those seven years, I helped him manage the company, negotiating with different clients every day, exhausting myself.

Lottie took advantage of this gap to develop a relationship with Stanley, engaging in their clandestine affair.

Little did I know that those years of being his loyal servant would give me a chance to start over.

I have the resources, connections, and business acumen. What do you have to hold me back?

==============================

Just as my company was thriving, disaster struck.

Aside from a few initial media reports about Stanley, his scandalous affair, which should have rocked the city, barely made a ripple.

Such a big story going unreported? It was obvious Richard Griffin had a hand in it.

Expected, after all, the elite care about their image.

What I didn’t expect was the Griffins turning the tables, buying trending hashtags.

Now, everyone in G City knows that the Griffin heir’s fiancée led a scandalous life, trying to marry into wealth and being rejected.

Years of hard work gone to waste, and the younger man I was rumored to be involved with left too.

I laughed in anger.

Many business partners terminated their contracts with my company due to the rumors.

In the blink of an eye, the company’s situation took a nosedive, teetering on the brink.

That’s when Brycen Elliott returned.

==============================

The Elliotts and the Lawrences were close family friends. Brycen was originally my fiancé, but I was so infatuated with Stanley that I gently rejected his feelings.

Unable to change my mind, he chose to stay out of sight, spending the last few years abroad.

He had heard about my situation and rushed back from the U.S.

Bringing with him the connections and resources he had accumulated over the years.

Brycen and I had grown up together, and our默契 was such that we didn’t even need to speak to understand each other. I trusted him completely.

With his help, the company’s situation improved significantly.

I began to expand new business sectors based on my experience from working at Stanley’s company,

Slowly forming a rivalry with Stanley’s business.

The war between Stanley and me had just begun when the unscrupulous media started stirring up trouble again,

With headlines like ""Long-time lover steps in to lend a hand"" and ""Stanley and his lover as close as brothers, betrayed by deceit.""

I rolled my eyes, turning to Brycen, who was organizing files behind me, and bowed slightly.

""Sorry, sorry. Bear with it for a while, and I’ll clear your name.""

He smiled, his gaze locking onto mine.

""No big deal.""

# Chapter 2 - ""Unexpected Encounters and Shattered Illusions""

I thought Stanley and I would never cross paths again, at most, we’d be rivals in business.

But in the midst of a fierce corporate battle, he abruptly sold his company.

I heard Richard Griffin was furious and threatened to disown him.

Lottie, being shrewd, saw that Stanley’s fortunes were dwindling and distanced herself early on.

I couldn’t help but wonder what had possessed him to do something so reckless.

Soon, I found out.

That evening, as I returned home, he cornered me in the narrow space by the door.

The familiar faint scent of tobacco enveloped me.

“Madilyn, I’ve missed you.”

He silently wrapped his arms around me from behind, his touch unexpectedly gentle.

He carried a faint whiff of alcohol, and I found myself wondering what he had been drinking today—it seemed different from before.

Suddenly, alarm bells rang in my head, and I forcefully broke free from his embrace. The dim light cast fragmented shadows in his eyes, and he raised an eyebrow slightly, his voice tinged with confusion.

“Madilyn?”

I wiped the corner of my eye, a wave of inexplicable disgust rising within me. I took a deep breath, trying to steady my emotions.

“What are you doing here? This is my home.”

I stared directly at his slightly haggard face, a mix of complex emotions swirling inside me.

“Madilyn, I was wrong this time. I promise I won’t get involved with any other women again.”

I looked at him coldly, saying nothing.

He seemed startled by the icy look in my eyes, his hand awkwardly suspended in the air.

“Madilyn, enough of this. Don’t make a scene,” he said softly, reaching out to pull me closer.

“Who’s making a scene?”

“Cut me some slack. Everyone makes mistakes.”

“When I don’t like you anymore, don’t come bothering me. Who do you think you are?”

I took a few steps back, looking at him with mockery.

I finally realized how naive I had been, thinking that pretending not to know would keep him mine forever.

Thinking that forgiving him time and time again would move him.

Love can’t be earned through pity.

In the darkness, he was silent for a long moment.

“What do you want from me?”

I raised an eyebrow dramatically, glancing at him sideways.

“What do I want? I want you to get lost.”

“Don’t disturb me and Brycen.”

The next morning, I woke up at noon.

After spewing those harsh words last night, I slammed the door and left Stanley outside, going to sleep on my own.

Rubbing my temples, I realized I hadn’t slept well at all.

In my dreams, scenes overlapped, and I repeatedly witnessed Stanley at dinners, in bars, flirting with different women.

Ugh, what a nightmare.

He’s the kind of guy who’s used to being the center of attention, treating love like a charitable handout.

He seems to have forgotten that he thought others’ admiration was based on what they could gain from him.

Once, someone loved his temper, his vulnerability, but he saw it as a loss of face.

True, pure love—he thought it was cheap.

Opening my work phone, 99+ messages flooded in.

My head was spinning.

Brycen’s call came through at that moment.

“Madilyn, where are you?”

Rubbing my temples, I sighed.

“At home. What’s up?”

“There’s a negotiation this afternoon with the VP of M Bank. I think you should meet them.”

The sunlight filtered through the thin clouds, casting a warm glow over the bustling city streets.

When I arrived at the office, Brycen was already waiting for me downstairs.

Today, he wore a dark casual suit paired with a crisp white shirt, the collar slightly open, exuding a relaxed yet elegant vibe.

His tie was a solid color, complementing the suit and shirt, neither too flashy nor too plain. His dark straight-leg pants were perfectly tailored, neither too tight nor too loose.

On his feet were black leather shoes, smooth and unadorned, yet exuding a subtle luxury.

Nothing like Stanley’s flashy peacock style.

Tsk tsk, those long legs, that broad shoulders and narrow waist—what a sight.

As I approached, he seemed to sense my presence and looked up, handing me an Americano. A faint cedar scent wafted from his sleeves, his signature cologne.

“Madilyn.”

I took the coffee.

“Let’s talk inside.”

# Chapter 3 - ""Ravioli, Rivalries, and Reminiscence""

The discussion lasted the entire afternoon, and by the time all the details were finalized, the city lights had already illuminated the night outside.

""Madilyn, let's go grab some of Alfredo’s ravioli,"" Brycen said as he gently draped a coat over my shoulders from behind.

I remember when I was a kid, I’d knock on Brycen’s door whenever I got hungry at night, and he’d take me to a small alley not far from home for ravioli. The pasta was thin, the filling generous, and they were always piping hot. We’d both eat until we were sweating, and Brycen would fan me while holding a chilled soda to my lips.

Since we went there so often, Alfredo got to know us and would often sneak a few shrimp-filled ravioli into our bowl of pork ones.

As those memories surfaced, I couldn’t help but smile softly. Those were the best days of our lives.

""Alright, let’s bring something for Alfredo too,"" I said.

He smirked. ""Sure.""

He took me to a nearby supermarket. I had intended to buy some health supplements for Alfredo, but in the fresh produce section, I spotted a familiar figure—Stanley Griffin.

He saw me too, and Brycen, who was pushing the cart beside me.

========================================

What followed was a scene straight out of a dramatic soap opera.

His eyes first lit up like a shooting star streaking across a dark sky, a brief flash of brilliance in the deep blackness. Then, just as quickly, the star plummeted to the ground, stirring up a whirlwind of dust, igniting a fiery blaze.

Stanley strode over to me in three quick steps, bringing a gust of wind with him.

He first lifted his chin, giving Brycen a cool, appraising glance, his posture immediately turning defensive. Then he turned to me, his voice tinged with a hint of grievance.

""Madilyn, didn’t you always say you wanted to try my cooking? I thought you’d be coming home soon, so I came out to buy some ingredients to make you dinner.""

Before I could respond, Brycen turned his head and spoke calmly, ""Madilyn, I know you’re compassionate, but you shouldn’t just bring any stray home. You never know what hidden motives they might have.""

""Yeah, trying to lay a hand on someone else’s fiancée. People might start thinking you have some kind of weird obsession.""

""Madilyn doesn’t like to make a fuss, but don’t think for a second that you’re worthy of her.""

""Since when did our business become your concern, outsider?""

""Who’s the outsider here, Stanley?""

I listened to their thinly veiled barbs, feeling like I was caught in the middle of a childish spat. Rubbing my temples, I finally interjected, ""Alright, we’ve got what we need. Let’s go?""

""Let’s go.""

""Let’s go.""

Both voices rang out simultaneously, one clear and cool, the other deep and resonant, but both equally dangerous.

It was clear that this wasn’t going to end easily.

""You…"" I turned to Stanley, forcing myself to meet his gaze. ""Don’t come bothering me again.""

I didn’t understand. He was the one who had cheated, so why did his eyes still hold such clarity?

I mentally scoffed. Capitalists will always be capitalists, putting on a facade with such confidence, as if it were real.

========================================

It was getting late, and Alfredo was about to close up shop when he saw us and welcomed us in with a warm smile.

Alfredo’s hair had grown whiter, his back more hunched, and he was always coughing now.

Time silently slipped by, and certain moments served as reminders that some things were gone forever.

The ravioli still tasted the same as I remembered, but now we were all grown up.

At the next table sat a father and son. The father was feeding his son bite by bite. At his feet was a burlap sack. When he noticed me looking their way, he gave a simple smile and opened the sack slightly, pulling out two bright orange tangerines.

""Here, miss, try these. They’re from our own garden.""

I took them and thanked him. They were sweet.

After we finished eating, Brycen drove me home.

As we said goodbye, he gave me a gentle hug.

""Madilyn, if you need anything, call me.""

His embrace was warm and comforting. I took a deep breath. ""Alright.""

Everything was getting better, after all.

Even if I had a bit of grass growing on my head, I’d plant flowers in it.

I was a modern, independent woman. Love couldn’t tie me down.

But then, almost immediately, I saw Stanley crouched by my doorstep, a bunch of green vegetables and bags of red and white meat beside him.

Hearing the sound, he quickly looked up.

Just like he was at home.

His eyes were still a bit moist. Yeah, even more like it.

I couldn’t keep smiling.

*A plot most freakish*

*A solution most neat.*

Hello! Welcome to NYPD: Shadowlands, a d20 Modern Urban Arcane adventure.

This will be an extended one-shot, with possibilities of extending into a full campaign (PbP gods willing). 

You'll play as Police Detectives in the NYPD, solving crimes with an arcane twist. Here there be Dragons... and you're one of em!

Play as an elf, dwarf, or most of the DnD races in a modern-day setting. Will your coffee be served by a halfling batista? Was the pizza you ordered made by a teifling? If you've read this, please fill out the RP sample with the name of King Arthur's wizard. 
It's a crazy world out there!

I'm looking for 4 players who enjoy getting into their characters and solving an amateur mystery story. I'm not looking for min/maxers, just people with interesting character ideas.

We'll be starting at 3rd level. In order to include magic earlier than intended, I'll be allowing the FX Mage and Acolite classes to be taken at level 1! 

The spell casting classes can use the expanded spell lists from Urban Arcana. No spells from 3.X will be allowed.

This will be a sandbox style game. I'll provide you with a bunch of leads and let you run with the investigation! I enjoy riffing off players' ideas and will allow you to run with reasonable ideas to solve the mystery. 

Thanks for reading this far, and I look forward to the game!

I’m not really sure how to start this, but I (28m) could use some guidance. I just turned 28 two weeks ago, and three weeks ago I lost my adoptive mom to cancer. It’s been devastating, and on top of the grief I feel really lost about where to go from here.

To give some context: I’ve never had a job or gone to school beyond high school. My parents made sure I was well taken care of financially, so I didn’t need to work or study — but now I feel stuck and unprepared for life. I live alone in Canada. Most of my friends are in Europe (I try to visit when I can), but here I don’t really have any close connections.

Since my longest relationship ended last August, I’ve been spending most of my time alone. My daily routine has basically become going for coffee and smoking weed, and I don’t want to keep living like this. I feel lonely, unmotivated, and unsure of how to build a life for myself — how to make friends, find a purpose, or even just start adulting properly.

If anyone has been in a similar spot or has advice on where to even begin — making friends, exploring work or school, breaking out of this rut — I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks for reading.

I tried t-cut and then some autogleam super resin polish, this does absolutely nothing to the paint work. 

Any recommendations on how to bring the paint work back, I don’t really care about the swirls it’s just the dull matte patch which bothers me.

1lqyfy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chattanooga/comments/1lqyfy6/snoopers_rock_wedding/,Snoopers Rock Wedding,"Sooo I had a friend visiting and planned a whole morning on going to snoopers to watch the sunrise. Wake up at 4 am, get our things together and hustle to Prentice. We get there and are the only ones there. Unpack the stove to make some coffee and get some blankets. On our second trip to unload from the car, another car pulls up. Great, we won’t be alone but whatever that’s fine it’s a public park for everyone to enjoy. 

This woman and man eventually walk down to the lookout and sees us posted up in our spot. She then says “Excuse me, I’m the photographer for this wedding we’re about to have here in a bit so are you guys going to be here long?” OooOoooh boy. My response was “Well given this is a public park, we got here first to enjoy the sunrise, we will sit here and make some coffee as we planned. Whenever your wedding couple gets here, we can get out of the way but for now, we’re gonna sit here and enjoy the view.” She said ok and her and her guy sat down for a bit as well. We hear multiple cars start coming down the road and they go to meet them. When they walked away, my friend says “I’m not a happy person before my coffee but I totally would’ve bitched her out and said sorry not moving. You’re nicer than me.” I explain it’s a popular spot for people to get engaged/married so I can’t take that away from them but I just hope they respect our time here as well. Welp, after all this I wish I was a bit more harsh. Here’s what happened…

8 adults and two kids come on down to the lookout making allllll the fucking noise they want. Talking loud, moving stuff around, the kids are maniacs and I’m getting the look from my friend of “you’ve got to be kidding me, I’m pissed.” She doesn’t believe in matrimony or want children so this already isn’t her cup of tea. I start heating up the water, pouring our coffee into our cups then dismantling everything to be put away. At this point, I’m seeing they are watching us waiting for us to move. We move our things aside, let them have the lookout spot, and sit with our coffees trying to watch the sunrise peacefully. As soon as we move they immediately get to it. Commence wedding, three adults all on their phone FaceTiming other family members so they can watch, walking around like crazy getting in our way of the view, and listen to this sermon where I heard “God” more than I heard about this couple. We are both not religious, but respect whatever beliefs you have as long as you respect our non belief. Just saying this to emphasize our “ugh really?” feels we were having already before they got started on their sermon. We don’t go to church, but now we have to listen to this meanwhile we are trying to enjoy Mother Nature in peace. 

Anywayyy, they finish their vows, yay congrats, now what? They continue to take so many pictures, different poses, talk loudly, kids are screaming, and everyone walking around. The officiant is the only one who came to us after to thank us for moving out of the way. My friend didn’t say anything but I said “yeah, I understand it’s a popular spot, it happens.”What I should’ve added is: anyway you guys could respect us and be a bit more quiet? Possibly be a bit more considerate about our intentions to be here as well?” Shoulda, coulda, woulda. Eventually they leave ONLY because one of their kids almost ran off the cliff while the bride almost tripped on her wedding dress trying to grab him. Thanks kid, glad you’re ok but you made the wedding end. Afterwards it started raining and we didn’t even get to enjoy the spot in peace as hoped. My friend later said that they completely ruined her first experience seeing Snoopers but thanked me either way of showing her what beauty we have here. We went there to have a peaceful morning and instead left pissed off and walked all over. My friend was right about one thing: if they wanted to for sure have that spot for their wedding, well they should’ve gone through the same effort to be there first and get there super early. The photographer got there before the wedding party!

So here’s to you Noogans, what would you have done? Has this happened to you? Should I have stood my ground on keeping my spot we planned for? What are our opinions on Snooper becoming a site for this kind of thing? Should we enable some sort of petition to keep people from getting married there? All about nature weddings, but you usually have to apply with said spot to do so. Shit, I have some friends that got illegally married at a state park here and they got a ticket for it. Should we start doing that for Snoopers?",0,1751570682.0,Chattanooga,16,0.33,False
1lqyf79,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lqyf79/i_26f_wrote_a_book_and_my_husband_27m_wont_read/,I (26F) wrote a book and my husband (27M) won’t read it. How do I explain how important it is to me?,"	I (26F) wrote and self-published a small, about 80 pages, Christian book over a year ago and my husband (27M, let’s call him Drew) hasn’t read it yet (we’re both Christians). For some context for why the book is so important to me. After college I moved to a new city for work and knew one person in the vicinity, she’s married and lived kinda far away so I hardly ever saw her, so I was basically starting fresh. The book started out as me basically journaling about everything God was teaching me in this new city - I had never lived alone before and had never lived this far from home. Then as I started going to a church and small groups I realized that this community was very different from the one I had formed in college and I just started writing about the Christian walk. It was so cool to be able to share what I knew and for others to teach me what they knew simply because we’d had different backgrounds and struggles. I had a ton of free time since I didn’t know many people and was used to staying up late doing schoolwork, so I began shifting my journaling into a more structured book. I started in summer of 2022 and finished that fall, about a year after I had moved there. I debated it a while but ended up self-publishing in January of 2024 and all my new friends were so excited for me they threw me a publishing party and I even had friends from college make the trek to come and celebrate with us.
	Now, background on Drew, he went to the same church I started going to and I ended up joining the friend group he and a bunch of other peeps were in. We started becoming better friends, and he ran into me a few times in coffee shops when I was working on my book. He would ask a ton of questions, was super interested and encouraging about me writing, and even joked that he’d only read it if I published it as a way to encourage me to commit to finishing. We started dating in the summer of 2023 and on several occasions he would ask me when I was going to publish my book and would send me different resources to do so. When I finally sent the book in to be printed he came over with champagne and little glasses to celebrate and kept telling people he was dating an author. As soon as I got the email saying it was available on Amazon, I told him and he was the first to buy a copy. He brought it up to his friends and family and told everyone to buy the book and was just so encouraging about all of it. Then, when we were planning the publishing party, he realized he’d forgotten about a trip he’d booked months ago for that same weekend and apologized profusely about missing the party. He offered canceling the trip, but I told him to go, him missing the party wasn’t that big of a deal, and I meant that. 
	However, as time went on I’d ask him about my book and if he’d started it, he’d always sheepishly respond that he hadn’t yet but that he would soon. And when he did start it, he read about a chapter and then left it alone for months. After several months of this I sat down with him and explained why it meant so much to me for him to read it. I was hurt that I had friend’s boyfriends reading it because they wanted to support their girlfriend’s friends, but my own boyfriend hadn’t read it. His mom had read it, but he hadn’t. I explained that because of the time in my life that I wrote it at and the content, that him not reading it made me think that he didn’t care about my thoughts or convictions. He apologized and said that he’d read it, and that he hadn’t yet because he was nervous that he wouldn’t have anything thought provoking to say about him. Drew knows me extremely well and knew that I’d want to discuss the book with him and he was insecure that he wouldn’t be able to intellectually keep up. I reassured him that I wouldn’t judge him by what he said about it, but I wanted to know what he thought about something I poured a lot of time, energy, thought, and effort into. He understood and promised to read it… it’s been a year since that convo and we have since gotten married and I believe he’s only read three out of ten chapters.
	I get his insecurity but I don’t get why it would be so debilitating. He has read several books since we started dating, I got him into Fourth Wing and he read all the books with me and would talk about those, so it’s not like he’s unwilling to read or discuss unserious things. Is the content just that much more serious since it’s a Christian book? The book is short, so it’s not like it’s some daunting read, nothing compared to others he’s read with me or on his own. I also wrote it very conversationally so it’s not like a super academic book either. I don’t know, we’ve talked about it a few times in the 1.5 years I’ve had it published, but I don’t know what else to say to explain how important this is to me.

TLDR - I’ve had a book out for 1.5 years that’s only 80 pages and my husband won’t read it after we’ve talked about how important it is to me, what else can be done?",2,1751570631.0,relationship_advice,7,0.75,False
1lqyesz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqyesz,June 28/29th hike of Big Cypress,"Hello all. I recently made a post here about water cache's on the initial Big Cypress section of the Florida trail. The below is a partial writeup of the trip. I hope the information below is helpful to anyone considering a hike. TO BE VERY CLEAR, this is not an entry level or even moderate hike if you go in the Summer. Please be careful and hike within your limitations, but don't let anyone tell you can't do something if you are willing to put in the work for it. 


Basic Hike info and trail status:


Plan:
Start at daybreak with plenty of water, food, camp equipment to complete the journey. I expected to move at roughly 2 miles an hour though the water and take breaks every hour and a half to 2 hours for 30 minutes each time. Depending on temperature, I would start a noon break noon or 1pm and wait until about 3:30 for the temperature to drop before continuing on. First night of camping would be at 13 mile campground (~17 miles in), while the second day would cover the remainder of the trail. Grab an Uber at the rest stop on I75 to close out the trip and call it a day.


Preparation:
All camping and hiking gear is what I already use for kayak camping. I am physically fit and exercise multiple times a week for endurance and leg, back, and core strength. I've spent the preceding 3 weeks planning out pace, path, breaks, equipment and consumables using the FTA site, the parks site, Facebook groups and Reddit. To prepare for bugs, I sprayed down my clothing, hammock, and much of my cloth gear with Permethrin, had a 2oz bottle full of Picaridin, and a 4oz bottle of 100% Deet.


Notes and General points to keep in mind: I am not a hiking professional and to be honest this is the most audacious solo camping trip I've done my far. I have done hikes in a neck deep swamp before, but that was many years ago and I wasn't alone. I didn't have a clear plan of how I wanted to document this at the beginning, and I was winging it somewhat. I did miss some of the Trail mile markers and they don't fully align with the milage. Don't take my word as gospel, only know that if you fully prepare you can do this,.
If you are doing this hike in the summer, I would highly suggest you are fit, you know your gear, you stay very aware of how much water you are drinking each hour, and you are fully aware that there are going to be major parts of this hike that are terrible. This hike can be dangerous if you are careless or do not properly address your obstacles. 


Friday Night:
Arrival at the Oasis Visitor's center late on June 27th and pitched a tent in the yard. Even at this point, the mosquitoes were not great but as long as you kept walking they wouldn't catch up to you. Stop for more than 2 seconds though and they will start to cover you. I set up as quickly as I could and settled in for a fitful sleep. Not sure if it was the warmth or the anticipation, but I awoke frequently.
Notes - Restrooms and water fountains available on site near the trail start.


Start off:
5:45am on the 28th, I had hoped to be packed up and ready to roll at first light after a relaxing couple cups of fresh coffee, but that didn't happen. I took far longer to pack the temporary gear back in my car and avoid the bugs as best I could. I'm fairly certain the 2 random people checking out the short wooden walkway by the Oasis Center thought I was nuts as I walked in circles fleeing the mosquitoes. Sign the log book and step on the trail at 6:28am. By 6:36 and I'm by the flightline as the bugs are drinking the DEET off me. I'm second guessing myself badly as the bugs are literally coating my shoulders or any part of me that stops moving for moment. I take my fist steps in the water at 6:41. Time to commit.


Mile 1: Did not see a sign, but there is water. I was moving as fast as I could to avoid the mosquitos and have to rely on my notes.


Mile 2: Past marker at 07:16am. Starts drying out a little bit here and there. 72°, 4G with Verizon, 1 bar.


Mile 3: Just past the Florida trail milage sign covered in shotgun pellet dents and the ""Keep Out"" Fence, I hit the mile marker at 7:36am. It was around this point the Mosquitoes start thinning out and the last mile was mostly dry. 74°, 4G with Verizon, 1 bar. 


Mile 4: Hit mile marker at 8:10am, but had a decent water section about 10 minutes prior until the marker and there is water ahead. Still have some spotty cell reception.(19.9 miles via Alltrails)


Mile 5: Mile Marker missed. Around this time I hit a fairly flooded section and stopped to filter water. Unfortunately I didn't pay attention and dumped my power bank and a few other items in the water. Luckily most were in Ziplock's for this scenario, but the power bank hit a rock that ripped a small hole and let a small amount of water in.  More to come on that later. Plenty of water on this section


Mile 6: Passed at 9:27. Nothing really special just putting in the miles. I have had to clean my shoes out from sand infiltration for the second time. I think this section was fairly dry (6.13M via AT)


7 Mile Camp: Arrived at 9:41. Seemed nice enough. Blue water jug present and partial full. Here or before this would have been a good place to switch to dry socks, but I didn't know at the time. Just past this, you will see another trail milage sign (6.44M via AT)


Mile 7: Passed at 9:52am. 5 minutes after this, back onto water walking. (7.18M via AT)  


Mile 8: Passed at 10:16 nice green but mostly dry section before this with lots of rock holes. Back to a water section at 10:30  (7.83M via AT) 


Mile 9: 10:58, mile maker hit. There is a nice open space on the rocks just to the right of the trail to take a break on, but I was not paying attention and walked about 10 meters off trail before reorienting.  (~8.66M via AT) 


10 mile camp: Arrived at 11am. There is also a trail milage sign here. The fire pit is still here but I didn't see any water jugs. Expect wet socks until at least camp as there is a small stream/bog before.


Mile 10:  Do not recall seeing marker. Was walking through water and stopped to filter and drink from about 11:10 to 11:30. As I stepped back on trial I plugged in a battery bank and got an error that water was in the charging port. I was down to 37% battery due to GPS, the hone searching for cell service, and taking photos. To avoid an bad situation if I couldn't dry it out, I shut the phone down  Gap in notes until after my noon day break. No or limited water available from here on.


Midday break: Around noon, I realized I was hitting my temperature limit in a hot dry stretch just south of a cypress dome, I set up my hammock and tarp by 12:30pm to have some shade while I ate, napped, and waited out the heat of the day. I napped from about 1 to 2pm, and after I woke I ate and drank a bit more before slowly packing back up. I would say the nap was comfortable, but it was cool enough and I was tired enough to sleep.
Approximately 3pm I hit the trail again as the temperature started to come down a bit. No or very limited water availability. 


Mile 11: 3:18pm. Very refreshed after the nap and food, No or very limited water availability.(10..13M via AT)


Mile 12: 3:53pm I was trying to put the miles in but seemed to take while as it's still hot. Fairly dry section without much shade. No or very limited water availability. (11.13M via AT) 


Mile 13: Mile marker at 4:21 and stopped for some water shortly after Temp is still reading 99° No or very limited water availability.(12..21M via AT)


Mile 14: I think I missed this mile marker but  I did take some pictures of the path going through some palm from type plants at 4:51pm. Still hot and I stopped to drink water and sock rotations. No or very limited water availability.(12..59M via AT)


Mile 15: Passing here at 5:32. I am starting to wear down and looking forward to setting up camp before long. No or very limited water availability.(~14..63M via AT)


Mile 16: Missed this one too but another section of being fairly dry. No or very limited water availability.


Mile 17/13 mile camp. Arrived at camp around 6:06pm The vegetation became very high just before and past this. I was pretty tired at this point and did a terrible job of taking photos or documenting. I also walked in circles for a while trying to decide my plan forward while trying to be a difficult target for the mosquitoes. There was a water jug here on Saturday night/ Sunday Morning that was partially full. I did try to go to a separate ""13 mile camp"" listed on all trails just past this a few 100 yards, but upon getting to the vehicle trail for the section the road was flooded out and I didn't want to end that day and start the next day in a giant mud puddle, so I turned back to the real 13 mile camp with signs. It's worth noting. Around 250 yards above and below the camp are not marked with Trail blaze very well. Again, this could have been me as I was winding down for the day or starting out the following day. ALSO worth noting, there are good water draw points just past 13 mile camp. Attach are a few sunrise pictures as I broke camp the following day. Back on trial at 7:34am.(15.04M via AT)


Mile 18 to Mile 26: I would have to guess that these have been lost to time as I was actively looking for the marker signs. There decent water sections just post camp. The terrain varies wildly though these sections from lush jungle like environments, back to the watery channels lined by small cypress and tall grasses, dried out expanses that are more field than swamp, full on bush whacking as the trail has been over grown, burned out sections from fire, and back to full swap my by the barb wire fence section. I did find it funny that just after the water portion of the barb wire fence, the bottom strand had been broken. I guess the gators don't pay a fence any mind. 


I stopped for a break at 9:08am near the south crossing of the raccoon point trail east of Calusa Ranch airport, (18.91M via AT).


Mile 27: Arrived at the mile marker 27 at 9:51am. That seems way off for me to complete 10 miles in under 2.5 hours Some ground water here for filtering (19.69M via AT)


Mile 28: Passing at 10:35. I did pass a section that looks like foodprints filled with water as someone hiked though 10 to 12 inch mud in the last few days, but the tracks disappeared and didn't follow the main trail for long. From about 10am to maybe 11:30, very little water availability.  (20.93M via AT)


Mile 29: Did not see this mile marker.


Oak Hill Camp Past at 10:51  (21.59M via AT)


From about 11:37am to 1215, set up poncho and took break. Local area is completely dry but is obviously covered in water normally based on ground surface.  No or very limited water availability.


Mile 30: No or very limited water availability. Past at 12:28pm (23.46M via AT)


Mile 31: Past at 12:59  No or very limited water availability. (24.63M via AT)


Thank God Island :Arrived at 1:19pm. I didn't want to stop here due to mosquitoes and I thought I was almost to the end based on the sign posts. Due to the heat and how depleted I was feeling, a long break here to drink, eat, and check feet for issues and to swap socks. The thermometer reads 104 after sitting in the shad for a few minutes. Lots of dense shade here.(25.35M via AT)(add Photos)


Mile 32: Past at 2:23. The previous miles were mostly dry but past here there are a few low puddles/ sitting water on the trail, but nothing too impressive. (25.78M via AT)


Camp Ivy: 2:27pm Did not see a water cache here, but lots of shade (25.91M via AT)


Mile 33: Past at 2:58 


Mile 34: Past at 3:40 (28.10M via AT)


Mile 35: Did not see this marker, but it could have just been me due to being tired. 


Wild Trail end at Fence: 4:36pm (~29.75M via AT)


MVP Gear
	1- Head-bug-net combined with fishing/boonie style hat - Absolute life saver. I could not have done this hike without it. As stupid as you may think you look, not having to deal with bugs landing on and biting your face and head massively helpful to maintaining your sanity. 

2- Tarp or Pancho - Incredibly important for a summer hike. There were many try sections where the trees provided next to no shade. I highly suggest being fully in the shade. 

3- Thermacell hand held version - I'm honestly not sure If I just got lucky or what, but this drastically reduced any new bugs from coming onto the campsite. If they were already present or followed me into the 5 meter bubble this is advertised to protect, It didn't help. What I do know is when I showed up to 13 mile camp, there was a swam of mosquitoes. While sitting down to eat and sleeping at night in a hammock, I hardly noticed them when this was running. I chose to credit the Thermacell and not my luck. 
Honorable mentions:

- Battery powered Fan. I was very lucky that it cooled off the first evening, but for anyone that does camping where the evenings are above 80°, I highly encourage you get a fan. It isn't air conditioning, but you would be surprised how much a light breeze on your chest and face can cool you down in a tent or hammock when there air is stagnant. 

- Trekking poles - I would not suggest anyone start this trail without one for each hand. This saved me from falling dozens of times. Even if I was using a random stick, I would have eaten the mud multiple times. These were also helpful to carry the weight of a 45 pound pack.


Most disappointing Gear:

1- Sawer Micro - hands down the biggest waste of time while hiking. The flow rate out of a smart water bottle took forever to filter a liter of water. I'm not sure if I didn't back flush it enough, but the water I filtered only had a mild yellow ting to it and very little debris. 

2- 100% DEET spray by REPEL- I sprayed this on me in the parking lot, but maybe I didn't use enough. At least for the first day, It almost seemed like the mosquitoes were licking it off be before they bit me. On the second morning before leaving camp thoroughly drenched my shirt and pants without applying any to my face or head. By doing this, they seemed to avoid my body but landed on my head bug net. Due to the standoff caused by my hat, they never got close enough to bite my face. Mosquitoes and Deer flies included.  

3- Hiking pole Mud cups - I broke one of these by Oak Hill camp and another within the last 4 or 5 miles. Luckily this didn't impact me much as most of the deep water was done my by this point. 


General Good Suprises.
 
- On the second morning I decided to take a calculated guess on applying the bug spray of 100% Deet since I try and avoid chemicals. Instead of spraying it all over me, I sprayed down my pants and long sleeve shirt as much as I could, but left my head alone. I also used Picardian on my shirt and pant openings such as wrists, ankles, hands, and neck, but that was the extent of bug repellent. I hoped by leaving my head free they would attack there and ignore the bug sprayed clothing. It worked! I have almost no bugs on my shoulders, chest, arms, and legs the second day while they attacked my bug net covered head at every turn but were blocked. I was extremely happy with that outcome.

- After the first 2 to 3 miles, the mosquitoes were only intermittently bad, and this was nearly always near the jeep trails or in recently dried out sections. Almost all water hiking portions past  mile marker 3 were devoid of the bugs. I can't tell you how much I treasured the dragonflies on this trip.


General Disappointments:
- The lack of wildlife. I am very happy there were no close encounters with either gators, snakes, panthers, or large boar, but I didn't expect that it would be near barren for most of the hike. Even the birds were gone. 
- Being unaware of the milage covered was disorienting. While I knew the mile markers would be off, they seemed to have no rhyme or reason during the second half. It made it much more difficult to pace myself as well as water and caloric intake. 

-I shouldn't have doubted myself as much as I did going into this. This was not an easy hike, but bringing 10 liters of water was a burden and not needed. If you filtered at each opportunity, 4 liters would have been plenty for me and I think most people who can maintain a 2.5mph pace would have no issue when carrying a max of 6 liters of water and taking a long break from 11 to 11:30am to 3:30 to 4pm. I would advise no one travel from Noon to 3pm if at all possible. ",1,1751570604.0,floridatrail,0,1.0,False

We're Lisa and Pol, we just finished a 6-months journey backpacking across the Middle East and Asia on a budget. It's actually almost 2 years now that we quit our jobs to travel. Last year, we posted a recap of our [300-day adventure from Cairo to Cape Town](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1dz1wqa/300_days_backpacking_africa_cairo_to_cape_town/) on this subreddit, and got many good interactions from it, so we're doing it again here :)

# About us

Lisa is 30, from Slovakia, and Pol is 28, from France. We met traveling in the US 7 years ago (and started dating a year after). After 2 years living together in Paris, we decided to quit our jobs and go for a world tour ; we saved approx 15.000€ each. We wanted to start with Africa, and pretty soon realized that we wanted to stay as long as possible on the continent. In total we spent 10 months there, spending 10.000€ each (34€/day/person). At the end of the year of travel, we were pretty tired and happy to be home. For 6 months, we travelled in Europe visiting our friends and families, unsure of what we would do next. Around November, we started being bombarded by content about the Middle East and we decided to put all the money we had left to start traveling for 6 more months on the road with our 40L backpacks!

# Itinerary (11 countries)

[We use Polarstep to track the itinerary](https://preview.redd.it/pen4zbh4apaf1.png?width=2907&format=png&auto=webp&s=4505cada6c617dbb1d79521d13edfe4c47a43633)

We started in Oman in January for a 10-day roadtrip with Lisa's parents (hence the budget is not really accurate for that country). 5/6 days in the Emirates and 16 days in Saudi. We rented a car and explored a huge chunk of it. 

We then flew to India (65€ tickets) to Mumbai and made our way North through Rajasthan, the Golden Triangle and Varanasi. One month in Nepal, trekking two times 5 days, and having a great time. 9 days in Thailand visiting friends and getting some rest and editing Youtube videos. One month in China (part of it was a collab), mostly in the South-East region. 5 budget days in Hong Kong, trying to do the free things and 12 days rushing through Vietnam as the time starts ticking for us. 

From there, we start a 40-day crossing of Central Asia: 2 weeks of trains in China, a week in Kyrgyzstan and 10 days across Kazakhstan... Back home on June 30th, exactly 6 months!

# Budget

**Number of days :** 181 (6 months)

# Fun facts

We used Couchsurfing a lot during the trip and the most welcoming country was Saudi by far, we only booked one hotel in 16 days!

Pol got typhoid fever in India after testing a lot of street food ...

Nepal became our favourite country. The treks are amazing, no phones, no internet, raw emotions! We also celebrated Holi in Pokhara and it was great!

We got invited to travel to China for 12 days for free! We were shown around Shanghai and Hangzhou, met many students, got interviewed and got access to really cool places (community centers, HQ of Alibaba, guided visits of monuments).

Saudi and China are the two countries that surprised us the most: Saudi is modern, has amazing heritage, the people were extremely nice to us, very educated, many had studied in the US or Europe. Everything is quick and efficient, you can get a new passport from your phone, delivered to you in 48h! China, we spent 6 weeks overall in many different regions, traveling by train. It's clean, silent (electric cars), full of amazing culture and traditions, lots of great food. Very easy to travel to because of the internet and 3/4 apps that make everything comfortable. Once you've visited one city and figure out the system, it's virtually the same everywhere.

Vietnam (with maybe Thailand) are by far the easiest, most comfortable and affordable countries of the trip. Nice people, good food, convenient, great nature. There's a reason it's so touristy! (Vietnam felt a bit too much, coming from China were you almost never see another international tourist, it's quite a shock).

We crossed from Vietnam to the Caspian Sea by train (roughly 8000km). Basically in February we started to question what we would do after reaching China, and we found that the absolute cheapest ticket from Asia back to Vienna was 110€ from Aktau, Kazakhstan. That's how we figured out the entire second stretch of the trip.

The 3-day horse trek in Kyrgyzstan is our absolute favorite activity ever, it was amazing! Riding 4h per day on endless plains, with many free roaming horses around, sleeping in Yurts, perfect! (and quite affordable!)

**Favorite countries :** totally biased of course, but we would say Nepal, Kyrgyzstan, China. Kazakhstan was probably the worst country of the trip, we got scammed by a travel company (Travel Panda) and overall people were not as friendly. We were also tired, it was our last country after 6 months of traveling.

# Final words

The last year we spent in Africa set the bar extremely high for any other long trip we would do. We felt so free, adventurous, and genuinely happy there that we knew it would be hard to match on this trip. We wanted to avoid just being on the typical South-East Asia itinerary to visit places less on the radar, so we tried our best to craft our own itinerary and try to visit a bit more remote places. Saudi comes to mind, Xinjiang in the far West of China, in general we had the best time in these type of places. Couchsurfing as always was super decisive in getting in touch with locals and learning more about the food, the religion, the lifestyle of the places, we highly recommend it. We've been to many places by now and what we value most are genuine interactions with people (and awesome nature!).

We're glad we visited the continents in this order, heading to Africa after these 6 months would be much harder probably. You really do get very comfortable in Asia with amazing cheap hostels and reliable information. Even India didn't really feel challenging (as many people warned it would be).

And for now we're back home for a bit, brainstorming on what's next :)

It's a already a long post but there's so much we haven't addressed here, we'd love to answer your questions on this journey or the previous one, backpacking for a long time, creating content on the road or just anything that comes to mind. Here is a quick 1-picture per country selection (not in order sorry) to illustrate a bit the trip.

I’m a fun and adventurous guy seeking a Dominant woman who is interested in a Female Led Relationship.

I’m 34, 5’11”, I live an active lifestyle, a bit nerdy, and can be a bit shy when first meeting people.

In my Vanilla life, I have my life together and work a full time job in Tech. On my free time, I love making art, playing video/board games, planning out travel trips, concerts, and hanging out with friends.

In the bdsm world, I’d love to find a dominant to serve. I love the rituals, giving up controls, and focusing entirely on my partner. I enjoy being caged, love bondage, following directions, pegging, body worship, and humiliation. I’m not into findom and am not interested in pro-dommes. I would like to develop a meaningful relationship with a power dynamic involved. I hope to meet a goddess to serve soon!

""I Rented a Cabin with My Girlfriend… But She Was Already Dead.   The final stretch of road to the cabin was a serpent of wet asphalt, slick with a patina of fallen leaves. Autumn had bled all over the mountains, staining the world in hues of rust and gold. Beside me, Clara was silent, her gaze fixed on the dense tangle of trees blurring past her window. This trip was my idea, a desperate attempt to press the reset button on a relationship that had grown frayed and distant over the past few months. I reached across the console and took her hand. It felt like a small, cold stone in mine.     “Almost there,” I said, forcing a cheerfulness I didn't feel. “Just think—two whole days. No work, no phones, just us and a fireplace.”     She turned her head slowly, a motion that seemed to require immense effort. Her eyes, usually a vibrant, mischievous blue, were like polished glass, reflecting the dying light of the afternoon without taking any of it in. “Just us,” she echoed, her voice a monotone whisper, devoid of its usual warmth.     I squeezed her hand. No response. I dropped it back into her lap, my own fingers tingling with a strange, residual cold. I blamed the weather, the long drive, the stress we were trying to escape. An excuse for everything.     The cabin was exactly as advertised: secluded, rustic, and bordered on all sides by a dark, imposing forest. As I fumbled with the old brass key, a shiver traced its way down my spine, a cold that had nothing to do with the crisp mountain air. Inside, the air was stale and heavy. A thick layer of dust coated the pine furniture, and the great stone fireplace looked like a gaping, soot-stained mouth.     “Home sweet home,” I announced, dropping our bags. I turned to Clara, expecting a sarcastic comment or at least a roll of her eyes. Instead, she had drifted to the large picture window overlooking the woods. She stood perfectly still, her back to me, a slender silhouette against the encroaching twilight.     “Clara?”     She didn’t move. I walked over and put my hands on her shoulders. The fabric of her sweater felt impossibly cold, as if she’d been standing outside for hours.     “You okay, babe?” I asked, my voice softer now.     “They’re watching,” she murmured, her breath fogging the glass.     “Who’s watching?” I peered into the forest. There was nothing but a wall of shadow-draped trees. “It’s just the woods, hon. It gets a little spooky at dusk.”     She finally turned from the window, her face pale and impassive in the dim light. “I’m tired,” she said, and without another word, she walked into the bedroom and closed the door.     That night, my sleep was a battlefield. I was plagued by nightmares of drowning in icy water, my lungs burning for air that would never come. I’d thrash and wake up, gasping, the sheets twisted around my legs. Each time, I’d see Clara. She was sitting upright in the bed, her back ramrod straight, staring at the closed bedroom door as if expecting a visitor. She never seemed to sleep, never seemed to breathe.     The next morning, I found her in the exact same spot she’d been the night before—staring out the picture window. I’d made coffee, the rich aroma a desperate, normal-smelling anchor in the increasingly strange atmosphere of the cabin. She refused a cup. She refused the toast I made.     “You have to eat something,” I pleaded.     “I’m not hungry,” she replied, her gaze never leaving the trees. She began to hum, a low, tuneless sound that grated on my nerves. It was a melody I’d never heard, dissonant and strange.     By midday, I couldn’t take it anymore. The silence, the humming, the unnerving stillness of the woman I loved. I needed to hear another human voice. My phone, predictably, had no signal inside the cabin.     “I’m going to walk up the driveway,” I told her, grabbing my jacket. “See if I can get a signal, call my folks.”     She gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod.     The cold outside was a relief, sharp and clean. I walked a hundred yards up the gravel path until two bars flickered to life on my screen. A cascade of notifications flooded in. Voicemails, texts. Most were from work. But three were from a number I knew with a sickening lurch of my stomach: Clara’s mom.     My hands trembled as I tapped the voicemail icon. The first two were frantic, choked with tears. I clicked on the most recent one, dated from yesterday afternoon.     Her mother’s voice, a ragged, broken thing, filled my ear. “Alex… please, Alex, pick up. I… I don’t know how to tell you this. It’s Clara.” A sob tore through the speaker. “There was an accident… on Tuesday. A car… she was on her way home from work. Oh, god, Alex… she’s gone. Clara’s gone.”     The world tilted. The trees seemed to bend inwards, the sky a swirling grey vortex. Tuesday. That was three days ago. Three days before I’d picked her up for this trip. No. It was a mistake. A horrible, cruel joke.     My heart hammered against my ribs as I looked back at the cabin. And I saw her. A pale figure standing in the picture window, watching me.     Denial is a powerful anesthetic. I stumbled back towards the cabin, my mind racing, constructing a thousand logical explanations. It was a prank. Her mom was confused. It was a different Clara. Anything but the truth.     I threw open the door. “Clara!” I shouted, my voice cracking.     She was standing in the middle of the living room now, her head tilted at an unnatural angle. The humming had stopped. The air in the room was glacial, my breath pluming in front of my face.     “Clara, your mom called,” I said, my voice shaking uncontrollably. “She said… she said something crazy.”     “Did she?” The voice that answered was hers, but it was hollowed out, an echo in a deep, empty well.     “She said you were in an accident. She said you…” I couldn't finish the sentence.     The thing wearing Clara’s face smiled, and the sight of it broke something inside me. It was too wide, a grotesque slash in her pale face that didn’t reach her vacant eyes. “I was,” it said. “It was very cold. In the water.”     My nightmare. The icy drowning. It wasn’t mine.     “Who are you?” I whispered, backing away until my shoulders hit the rough-hewn wood of the door.     Its head tilted again, a dry, cracking sound like snapping twigs echoing in the dead silence. “You missed her so much,” it said, taking a gliding step towards me. Its movements were wrong—too smooth, like a puppet being pulled by unseen strings. “You were so lonely. You kept wishing she was with you, right here, right now.”     The temperature in the room plummeted. A frost pattern began to spiderweb across the windowpanes.     “You wanted her back so badly,” it continued, its voice beginning to change, layering over itself into a chorus of dry, whispering rustles. “You didn’t care what answered your wish.”     It took another step, and its form wavered, the familiar lines of Clara’s face and body seeming to blur at the edges, as if I were seeing it through heat haze. Her jaw unhinged slightly, stretching impossibly wide, and the voice that came out next was not human at all. It was the sound of wind through a graveyard, of dirt falling on a coffin lid.     “And I was so… hungry.”     I turned, my hand fumbling for the doorknob, twisting it frantically. It wouldn’t budge. I rattled it, threw my shoulder against the solid wood, but it was useless. A cold, metallic click from behind me told me why.     The key I had used to let us in was turning in the lock. From the outside.""",1,1751570379.0,stories,0,0.67,False

Alright, confession time! 
I tried out YourAcademicWriter when I was neck-deep in assignments and needed a quick fix. I’d seen it floating around online, and the name sounded trustworthy enough. But after actually using it, I knew I had to write this YourAcademicWriter review so y’all don’t waste your time (or your GPA).

TL/DR: 
I gave YourAcademicWriter a shot and ended up regretting it. 

The writing was sloppy, the communication was vague and the end result was barely usable. I’ve been using Killer Papers ever since and honestly wish I’d found them first 😕

Why I Chose YourAcademicWriter in the First Place
It was midterms week, I had three major assignments due, and I was running on catnaps and way too much coffee. And redbull (can’t forget that). I did a quick Google search for “essay help” and “homework access,” and YourAcademicWriter popped up high in the results. The site looked decent, the prices were on the lower end, and they promised fast turnaround.
I figured, why not? I was desperate and just needed something to hand in and I was almost broke.

My Experience Using YourAcademicWriter
Ordering was fairly straightforward. I picked a “premium” writer and paid extra for a “plagiarism-free guarantee” and early delivery. Everything seemed smooth… until the essay came back.
The paper felt robotic and kind of disjointed. Like it was copy-pasted from different sources and strung together with AI or something. There were no transitions between the ideas at all. It barely addressed my topic, and some of the grammar was straight-up confusing. It also included random paragraphs about stuff that didn’t relate to my thesis at all. When I asked for a revision, they gave me the runaround for two days and then sent back a paper that was a bit better, but in a half-hearted kind of way.

Also, I requested APA formatting, and it was this weird Frankenstein mix of MLA and hyperlinks. Didn’t help that when I checked it through Turnitin, it flagged 28% similarity. Yikes😱
What Changed When I Switched to Killer Papers
After THAT mess, I went into Reddit deep-dive mode and saw a few people mentioning Killer Papers. The big sell for me? They don’t use AI or outsource overseas. They use actual North American writers, and it showed. Oh boy, the difference was insane.

I tried them for my next class assignment, and the experience was a complete 180. The writer reached out to ask about my major and tone preferences, the paper came back clean, insightful, and 100% original (Turnitin score was under 3% and that was just the APA template where my details are supposed to go). They even nailed my professor’s quirky formatting preferences (she wants page numbers for EVERYTHING, ALL THE TIME). 

Killer Papers also offers true homework access through their writers. You can send them your class portal or files and they’ll actually go through the materials to craft the paper around the course: none of that cookie-cutter generic BS.
They’re not the cheapest option (seriously, I coughed and accidentally snorted some coffee), but honestly? The peace of mind and quality was WORTH IT. I’d rather spend a bit more upfront than scramble to fix a half-baked essay an hour before it’s due (ask me how I know 😖).

Final Thoughts
If you're wondering is YourAcademicWriter legit?, based on my experience, I’d say tread carefully. It might work for someone just looking to check a box, but if you care about your grades or need something properly academic, I’d look elsewhere.
Personally, Killer Papers has been my go-to ever since that first disaster. Real writers, no AI junk, reliable homework access, and consistently solid results. You can’t really ask for more. And how responsive the writers are is unparalleled.

TL/DR:
 This YourAcademicWriter review is based on my real experience: rushed work, poor writing, and a waste of time. Switched to Killer Papers and finally got the quality that I needed.

She stood perfectly still, her back to me, a slender silhouette against the encroaching twilight.     “Clara?”     She didn’t move. I walked over and put my hands on her shoulders. The fabric of her sweater felt impossibly cold, as if she’d been standing outside for hours.     “You okay, babe?” I asked, my voice softer now.     “They’re watching,” she murmured, her breath fogging the glass.     “Who’s watching?” I peered into the forest. There was nothing but a wall of shadow-draped trees. “It’s just the woods, hon. It gets a little spooky at dusk.”     She finally turned from the window, her face pale and impassive in the dim light. “I’m tired,” she said, and without another word, she walked into the bedroom and closed the door.     That night, my sleep was a battlefield. I was plagued by nightmares of drowning in icy water, my lungs burning for air that would never come. I’d thrash and wake up, gasping, the sheets twisted around my legs. Each time, I’d see Clara. She was sitting upright in the bed, her back ramrod straight, staring at the closed bedroom door as if expecting a visitor. She never seemed to sleep, never seemed to breathe.     The next morning, I found her in the exact same spot she’d been the night before—staring out the picture window. I’d made coffee, the rich aroma a desperate, normal-smelling anchor in the increasingly strange atmosphere of the cabin. She refused a cup. She refused the toast I made.     “You have to eat something,” I pleaded.     “I’m not hungry,” she replied, her gaze never leaving the trees. She began to hum, a low, tuneless sound that grated on my nerves. It was a melody I’d never heard, dissonant and strange.     By midday, I couldn’t take it anymore. The silence, the humming, the unnerving stillness of the woman I loved. I needed to hear another human voice. My phone, predictably, had no signal inside the cabin.     “I’m going to walk up the driveway,” I told her, grabbing my jacket. “See if I can get a signal, call my folks.”     She gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod.     The cold outside was a relief, sharp and clean. I walked a hundred yards up the gravel path until two bars flickered to life on my screen. A cascade of notifications flooded in. Voicemails, texts. Most were from work. But three were from a number I knew with a sickening lurch of my stomach: Clara’s mom.     My hands trembled as I tapped the voicemail icon. The first two were frantic, choked with tears. I clicked on the most recent one, dated from yesterday afternoon.     Her mother’s voice, a ragged, broken thing, filled my ear. “Alex… please, Alex, pick up. I… I don’t know how to tell you this. It’s Clara.” A sob tore through the speaker. “There was an accident… on Tuesday. A car… she was on her way home from work. Oh, god, Alex… she’s gone. Clara’s gone.”     The world tilted. The trees seemed to bend inwards, the sky a swirling grey vortex. Tuesday. That was three days ago. Three days before I’d picked her up for this trip. No. It was a mistake. A horrible, cruel joke.     My heart hammered against my ribs as I looked back at the cabin. And I saw her. A pale figure standing in the picture window, watching me.     Denial is a powerful anesthetic. I stumbled back towards the cabin, my mind racing, constructing a thousand logical explanations. It was a prank. Her mom was confused. It was a different Clara. Anything but the truth.     I threw open the door. “Clara!” I shouted, my voice cracking.     She was standing in the middle of the living room now, her head tilted at an unnatural angle. The humming had stopped. The air in the room was glacial, my breath pluming in front of my face.     “Clara, your mom called,” I said, my voice shaking uncontrollably. “She said… she said something crazy.”     “Did she?” The voice that answered was hers, but it was hollowed out, an echo in a deep, empty well.     “She said you were in an accident. She said you…” I couldn't finish the sentence.     The thing wearing Clara’s face smiled, and the sight of it broke something inside me. It was too wide, a grotesque slash in her pale face that didn’t reach her vacant eyes. “I was,” it said. “It was very cold. In the water.”     My nightmare. The icy drowning. It wasn’t mine.     “Who are you?” I whispered, backing away until my shoulders hit the rough-hewn wood of the door.     Its head tilted again, a dry, cracking sound like snapping twigs echoing in the dead silence. “You missed her so much,” it said, taking a gliding step towards me. Its movements were wrong—too smooth, like a puppet being pulled by unseen strings. “You were so lonely. You kept wishing she was with you, right here, right now.”     The temperature in the room plummeted. A frost pattern began to spiderweb across the windowpanes.     “You wanted her back so badly,” it continued, its voice beginning to change, layering over itself into a chorus of dry, whispering rustles. “You didn’t care what answered your wish.”     It took another step, and its form wavered, the familiar lines of Clara’s face and body seeming to blur at the edges, as if I were seeing it through heat haze. Her jaw unhinged slightly, stretching impossibly wide, and the voice that came out next was not human at all. It was the sound of wind through a graveyard, of dirt falling on a coffin lid.     “And I was so… hungry.”     I turned, my hand fumbling for the doorknob, twisting it frantically. It wouldn’t budge. I rattled it, threw my shoulder against the solid wood, but it was useless. A cold, metallic click from behind me told me why.     The key I had used to let us in was turning in the lock. From the outside.""",0,1751570309.0,story,0,0.5,False

By Mary Shelley","Anaya Moreno has spent years trying to move on from her forbidden love for Kairo Marshall, the man who raised her and who she secretly yearned for since childhood. After being sent away to Europe by Kairo himself, she meets Morgan Simmons, a kind and devoted man who helps her rebuild her life. However, when Kairo realizes his own feelings for Anaya, it may be too late—she is about to marry someone else, leaving him to confront the consequences of his choices and the pain he caused her...

# Chapter 1 - Entwined Fates: A Wedding and Wounds

My heart stumbled in my chest as I moved down the hallway, my eyes fixed on Morgan, the man I was about to wed. But before I could reach him, a firm grip encircled my wrist—on the very day of my wedding.

“What do you see in him?” The question caught me off guard, sending my pulse racing. It was Kairo—the man who had raised me since I was a child, the man I had secretly yearned for over the years.

He was the one who had sent me away to Europe for four long years after discovering the forbidden feelings I had hidden in my diary.

“I admire who he is. I love everything about him.” My voice was steady, almost icy, mirroring the detachment he had shown when he’d uncovered my hidden emotions.

The stairwell was unnervingly quiet, the only sound the rhythm of our breaths.

“Anaya, I regret it.” Kairo’s gaze lingered on my lips, darkening with intensity.

“Anaya, can’t we go back to how things used to be? Close, familiar... instead of being strangers?”

“Uncle, I’m only doing what you wanted,” I replied. “You wouldn’t expect me to divorce and run away with you, would you?”

The words slipped out effortlessly, and for a fleeting moment, Kairo seemed to consider it. Why not?

If I were willing, he could marry me.

If I were willing, he could take me anywhere I desired.

But as he steadied himself and met my gaze—a look that seemed to penetrate his very soul—he fell silent.

Anyone else could utter those words, but not him.

He was the one who had left me first, the one who had given up on me.

...

Standing at the familiar threshold, I felt a wave of disorientation. After being sent abroad for four years, I never imagined I’d have the chance to return to my hometown.

I still remember the words Kairo had spoken as he put me on that plane.

“Anaya, you are not allowed to come back without my permission!”

At the age of eight, after my parents died in an accident, it was my father’s friend, Kairo Marshall, who took me in and raised me.

When I turned eighteen, Kairo accidentally stumbled upon my diary and saw the affection I had hidden within its pages—something I had never dared to reveal to anyone.

He grew cold instantly, clutching the diary as he accused me of crossing boundaries, calling it utterly absurd.

I didn’t understand. We weren’t related by blood, and he wasn’t my real uncle, so why couldn’t I have feelings for him?

But he gave me no chance, sending me to Europe, where I stayed for four interminable years.

That place was over 7,500 miles from New York City—so far, so distant.

He had exiled me harshly, and eventually, I let go of my love for him.

Just as I was about to open the door, my phone rang.

Seeing “Hubby” on the screen brought an unconscious smile to my face, and I answered the call.

“Anaya, we’ve set the wedding date. It’s a month from now. Have you decided if you want the ceremony in New York or elsewhere in the States?”

The soothing voice of my fiancé, Morgan, on the other end inexplicably reassured me.

I thought for a moment and replied, “In the States.”

“Okay, I’ll start preparing then.” His voice remained gentle, and after a pause, he added, “Make sure you tell your uncle and invite him to our wedding when you’re back.”

“Sure.” I responded sweetly, and after exchanging a few more words, we reluctantly hung up.

When I was first sent to Europe, I struggled with the language and cultural differences. Life was hard, and on several occasions, I found myself in perilous situations, nearly losing my life during chaotic incidents.

In my panic, I called Kairo, hoping he’d take me home.

But call after call went unanswered, and every message I sent disappeared into the void.

If Morgan hadn’t appeared in time to save me, I might have succumbed to one of those terrifying events.

As we got to know each other, we realized we were alumni of the same school, and our bond grew from there.

Over the next two years, Morgan’s persistent pursuit finally won me over, and I accepted his confession.

After graduation, Morgan proposed immediately, and I agreed.

It was around this time that Kairo reached out to me for the first time, allowing me to come back to pay respects to my parents.

I also returned to deliver an invitation and to tell him I was getting married.

Just as I was entering the house, the door opened from the inside.

“Hey, Anaya! You’re back? Long time no see. I thought I recognized your voice outside.”

Arianna greeted me with a smile, and seeing me frozen, she added, “Don’t you remember me?”

I blinked, and after a moment, recognition dawned on me as I recalled the familiarity cloaked in her once-unknown face.

A nightmare resurfaced, and old fears flooded over me, leaving my limbs stiff and my back cold with shock. “What are you doing here?”

Before I could process the situation further, Kairo stepped out.

Tall and composed, he still exuded the same aloof elegance.

Seeing my reaction, he frowned in displeasure. “You should call her Auntie.”

Auntie?!

“Why her? She once...”

Those words about her bullying me hadn’t even left my lips when Kairo cut me off. “Once what?”

I remembered the past.

Life in Europe was harsh when I first arrived. Desperately clinging to hope, I searched for news of him, only to learn he had a girlfriend, one he showered with the same affection he once reserved for me.

Fireworks lighting up the sky on her birthday, 9,999 roses flown in just for her, extravagant gestures at auctions—all the tenderness he used to show me, now lavished upon her.

I cried alone in the dark, enduring the searing pain, surviving each agonizing night, until I finally accepted that he loved someone else.

But what I never anticipated was that the person who replaced me would be Arianna, the one who bullied me back in school!

Seeing him stand by her side, defending her, I opened my mouth, but ultimately shook my head, my voice barely above a whisper. “Nothing.”

“If there’s nothing, come in. Cherish this rare chance to return. Let go of past thoughts. Your parents’ anniversary is coming soon; I’ll go with you to pay respects.”

“Arianna will be moving in today too. Settle yourself in, and make sure to get along with her.”

With that, he left the house with Arianna in tow.

Watching them walk away, I could only offer a bitter smile.

After a long while, I murmured softly to myself, “There’s no future here, Uncle. Once I pay my respects to my parents, I’ll leave for good.”

They returned by evening, and it took until the dead of night to finish sorting their luggage.

Clutching my wedding invitation, I stood outside Kairo’s room, mentally preparing myself before softly knocking.

The door opened, revealing not Kairo, but Arianna.

Her smile was laced with malice. “What’s this? After so many years, are you here to catch up with me?”

I froze as countless nightmarish memories resurfaced. Instinctively, I tried to escape, but she grabbed my arm.

“I warn you, keep your mouth shut. Don’t even think about telling Kairo about the past.”

Hearing her menacing tone, I suppressed the fear and retorted, “You think that by my silence, the truth will stay hidden forever? One day, he’ll see your true colors.”

But Arianna didn’t seem afraid at all. Instead, she grew more smug. “Let’s see about that. I could crush you back then, and I can still do it now.”

Before I could react, she grabbed a cup of coffee nearby and splashed it onto herself.

“Ah!”

As her shriek pierced the air, Kairo rushed out from his study, panic-stricken.

He cradled Arianna in his arms as she lay there pitifully, tears streaming down her face. “Kairo, don’t blame Anaya...”

“Anaya, I allowed you to return, thinking you had let go of your feelings. I never imagined you’d remain so stubborn. Let me remind you one last time; some things are impossible. No matter what tricks you pull, you won’t get what you want!”

His harsh words made everything clear. He thought I’d thrown the drink at Arianna out of jealousy?

I hurriedly began to explain, “No, you’ve got it wrong. I came to give you a wedding inv...”

But before I could finish, Kairo carried Arianna away.

Watching him leave, I felt an overwhelming sadness wash over me. I let out a self-deprecating laugh, completing my sentence.

“I came to give you a wedding invitation. I don’t have feelings for you anymore, Uncle. I’m getting married.”

# Chapter 2 - Shadows of Unspoken Truths

Kairo showed up the following morning, just as I was clearing the breakfast dishes. I’d been ready to explain everything that had gone down the day before, but he didn’t give me the chance. Without a word, he took my hand and marched me out the door.

The car raced through the streets, finally screeching to a halt outside the hospital. Kairo didn’t release my hand until we were standing at Arianna’s bedside. Only then did he finally speak.

“Apologize to Arianna.”

I clenched my jaw, my refusal written all over my face. “Why should I apologize for something I didn’t do?”

When I turned away, unwilling to admit any fault, disappointment flickered in Kairo’s eyes. The tension between us was palpable, neither of us willing to back down. It was Arianna who broke the stalemate.

“It’s fine. Anaya’s still young. Maybe she’s just not used to sharing her favorite uncle. It’s just jealousy.”

“She’s only a year younger than you. How is that ‘young’?” Kairo’s voice was sharp, and his expression darkened further. He turned back to me, his tone leaving no room for argument. “Apologize. Now.”

All the explanations I’d prepared evaporated. The look on his face made it clear he’d already made up his mind—I was guilty.

I opened my mouth, suddenly too exhausted to fight. Maybe loving my uncle was my biggest mistake. No matter what happened, Kairo would always assume it was my fault.

“Sorry.”

After a long silence, I finally gave in. Kairo should’ve been satisfied, but seeing my sudden shift in mood seemed to unsettle him.

I didn’t care anymore. As far as I was concerned, once I apologized, it was over.

I couldn’t stand being in that room any longer, caught between them, so I made up an excuse to leave.

“I’m going to the restroom.”

I splashed cold water on my face, trying to wash away the frustration. Staring at my reflection, I pressed my lips together.

People always favor those they care about, and Kairo was no exception.

Just like I had been, and now Arianna.

Fine.

With that thought, I turned and left the restroom. As I reached the door, I saw him standing nearby, like he’d been waiting.

Just as I was about to walk past, Kairo spoke up.

“Arianna wants a sandwich from Ralph's Deli. I need to stay with her, so could you go get it?”

I hesitated for a moment but didn’t refuse.

As we brushed past each other, his voice came again, tinged with something unspoken.

“I’m going to marry Arianna. It’s best if you let go of those feelings.”

I paused but didn’t turn around. “Don’t worry, I’ve let it go. In a month, I’ll—”

“I hope you mean it.” Kairo cut me off and walked away.

I hadn’t gone far when I suddenly called after him.

“Do you really like Arianna that much? We’re the same age. If she can, why can’t I?”

“Yes.” Kairo turned back, his eyes warning me. “Anyone else can, just not you! Don’t bring it up again.”

I nodded. “Got it. I won’t mention it again.”

The hospital was on the east side of town, and Ralph's Deli was on the west. It was a long drive, and the place was packed. After waiting in line forever, I finally got the sandwich and hurried back to the hospital.

Out of breath, I handed it to Arianna. She took one bite and tossed it into the trash.

“It’s not fresh anymore; it doesn’t taste good. Never mind, Anaya, could you get me a cupcake from Bailey’s Bakery?”

I didn’t say a word, just met Kairo’s gaze before nodding. “Alright.”

Bailey’s Bakery was closer, but just as much of a hassle. When I returned, Arianna took one bite and dismissed it.

“Oh, I forgot to tell you, I don’t like this flavor.”

And so, I spent the entire afternoon running back and forth until she finally stopped nitpicking.

Thankfully, after that day, Kairo didn’t ask me to go back to the hospital. I avoided the place, and by extension, Arianna’s torment.

Until the day I was discharged. As soon as I got home, there was a knock on my door.

“The club president organized a reunion. Do you want to come along?” Arianna asked as she walked in.

I was about to say no when she linked her arm with Kairo’s and pouted playfully.

“Don’t be so quick to refuse! Staying cooped up at home is so boring. Kairo agreed to go with me. We haven’t seen everyone since graduation; you should come and have fun!”

Kairo, pulled into it, seemed a bit helpless but didn’t contradict her. Instead, he looked at her fondly. When he turned to me, the warmth vanished, replaced by a cold, hard tone.

“Arianna’s just thinking of you. Don’t make things difficult for her.”

I forced a smile, swallowing the bitterness and self-mockery, and nodded. “Fine.”

# Chapter 3 - Veil of Secrets: A Wedding Unveiled

The party was in full swing at a trendy bar in upstate New York. When Arianna Castillo walked in, arm in arm with Kairo Marshall, the room erupted in murmurs of surprise. Meanwhile, my entrance went completely unnoticed—and honestly, I didn’t mind. I preferred the quiet, the chance to observe without being seen.

I slipped into a corner, watching Arianna bask in the attention as Kairo attended to her every need. He ordered her favorite drink, draped his jacket over her shoulders when she shivered, and announced, “Since Arianna’s enjoying herself so much, tonight’s on me.”

The crowd buzzed with envy.

“Arianna, you’re so lucky! Isn’t he the CEO of Marshall Enterprises? I can’t believe he’s here at a casual get-together!”

“I always thought Kairo seemed so aloof on TV, but he’s so different with her. It’s like he’s a completely different person.”

“Totally. Every time they’re spotted together, it’s front-page news. I wish I could find someone like that.”

Amid the chatter, someone called out, “Arianna, you and Kairo are so perfect together. When’s the wedding? Don’t forget to send us invites!”

Arianna blushed, tugging playfully at Kairo’s sleeve. He glanced my way briefly, but seeing me calmly sipping my drink, he turned back to her with a soft smile.

“Soon,” he said. “We’ve already started planning.”

The room erupted in cheers.

Then, someone suggested a game, and the crowd pulled me in, urging me to get Kairo to join. I shook my head. “Kairo doesn’t usually go for these kinds of things.”

But Arianna turned to him. “Come on, Kairo. Just this once? It’ll be more fun with everyone.”

At her request, he agreed.

The first round ended with Kairo losing. He drew a penalty card that read: “Kiss someone of the opposite sex for one minute.”

Arianna’s cheeks flushed, and without hesitation, Kairo pulled her into a passionate kiss, the crowd cheering them on. Once, this might have stung, but I’d moved on. I clapped along with the others.

The minute flew by, and in the second round, I lost. The challenge was to reveal the top contact in my phone.

I showed my contacts, and everyone immediately noticed the name at the top—Husband?!

“Anaya, since when are you married? Why didn’t you tell us?” someone exclaimed.

I smiled. “It’s recent. You’ll all be invited to the celebration.”

I tucked my phone away, catching Kairo’s gaze. His expression was unreadable, but he stayed silent.

Later, as I headed to the restroom, I ran into Kairo in the hallway. His demeanor was icy.

“Marriage isn’t something to joke about,” he said sharply.

I didn’t hide anything. “I’m not joking. I came back to honor my family and to let you know I’m getting married. Uncle, if you’re willing, I’d like you to stand as a witness.”

He almost laughed, looking at me with disbelief. “Fine, if you’re serious, call this husband of yours. I want to hear it from him.”

Seeing he wouldn’t budge, I dialed the number. After several rings, it went to voicemail.

“There’s a time difference. He might be asleep,” I explained.

Kairo scoffed. “Once a lie is exposed, there’s no point in pretending. It just looks foolish. Anaya, stop joking about this.”

With that, he walked away.

As he disappeared, my phone rang—Morgan Simmons was calling. I answered, his voice warm and sleepy.

“Sorry, Anaya. I was napping and missed your call. What’s up?”

Watching Kairo’s retreating figure, I sighed softly. “Nothing, sorry to wake you.”

Morgan’s voice softened. “Anaya, you can never disturb me, no matter when you call.”

“Oh, and the wedding plans are underway. You once mentioned designing your own dress. Do you want it for the ceremony?”

I hesitated briefly but then nodded. “Yes.”

The next day, I went downstairs but didn’t see Kairo or Arianna. Without dwelling on it, I had a quick breakfast and headed to the bridal shop alone.

The attendant led me to the display area and fetched the dress that took center stage. The white gown hung silently on the mannequin as I took it and changed. Staring at my reflection in the full-length mirror, I felt a wave of nostalgia.

Years ago, I had poured my heart into designing this dress, dreaming of the day I’d wear it to marry Kairo. Now I wore it again, but I was marrying someone else.

“Anaya, what are you doing here?”

A familiar voice called out from behind me. I turned to see the surprised faces of Arianna Castillo and Kairo Marshall, followed by Arianna’s usual entourage.

I lowered my gaze. “I’m getting married. I ordered my wedding dress here, and today I came to pick it up.”

“You’re actually getting married? I thought you were kidding,” Arianna said, her face still full of disbelief. Beside her, Kairo’s expression was cold and displeased.

“It’s quite a joke, isn’t it? Who could she possibly be marrying, and where would she even hold the ceremony?” Kairo remarked sarcastically.

With a sigh, I tried to explain, “It’s true…”

But he cut me off sharply. “Saying it once is enough; there’s no need to repeat it.”

I didn’t understand why he was reacting so strongly, and frankly, I didn’t want to explain further. I was just about to ask the store clerk to wrap up the dress, but Arianna suddenly fixed her gaze on my gown, her face lighting up with admiration.

“If it’s just a joke, Anaya, can I have this wedding dress? I really love the design.”

I was stunned, instinctively shaking my head to refuse. Kairo’s brows furrowed at my response.

“You don’t even need a wedding dress. Since Arianna likes it, let her have it,” Kairo insisted.

I pressed my lips together, unwilling to give in, even as I watched Kairo’s demeanor grow darker. Arianna quickly intervened, “Alright, alright, why don’t you go wait outside. I’ll have a chat with Anaya. Sometimes, it’s easier for us girls to talk things through.”

After a moment of silence, he chose to leave.

As Arianna approached with a smile, memories of her bullying at school flashed through my mind. Alarm bells rang in my head, and instinctively, I tried to leave, but she suddenly grabbed my hair.

The next second, the sound of relentless slaps filled the air.

The burning pain on my cheeks transported me back to high school, back to when I was bullied. Forced to look up, all I could see was Arianna’s sneering face.

“Take off her clothes!” she ordered.

# Chapter 4 - Shadows of Betrayal

My friends descended on me like a swarm of angry bees. The familiar shadows of fear crept back into my mind, my breathing growing ragged as my body shook uncontrollably. I froze, my instincts to fight back completely gone, curling into myself like a wounded animal, clutching at my clothes in a desperate attempt to protect myself.

But how could I possibly fend off so many at once?

The wedding dress was torn from my grasp in one brutal motion, leaving me exposed and shivering. My vulnerability seemed to amuse Arianna Castillo, her lips curling into a cruel smirk.

Suddenly, as if struck by inspiration, she pulled out her phone and began snapping pictures of me, muttering under her breath.

“This is too good not to capture. Don’t you all agree?”

“Please, no…” I begged, my voice trembling, but my pleas only seemed to fuel her excitement as she continued to snap away, her laughter ringing in my ears.

The shrill ring of her phone finally interrupted her cruel antics.

Seeing Kairo’s name flash on the screen, she answered, her voice instantly sweetened. “Kairo, what’s going on?”

“Did she agree?” Kairo’s deep voice echoed through the phone.

Arianna glanced at me, her grin widening. “Don’t worry. Anaya’s always so easy to convince. I sweet-talked her, and she agreed to give me the dress.”

Still on the phone, she led her group of friends out of the shop.

Once they were gone, I managed to calm down enough to ask the shop assistant, who had been hiding in the corner, to bring me something to wear.

After leaving the bridal shop, I didn’t head home. Instead, I took the surveillance footage the assistant had pulled for me and went straight to the police station to report the incident.

But as soon as I got home, I received a message from the police department saying that my report had been withdrawn.

Shocked, I called them back immediately.

“Miss Moreno, someone claiming to be your uncle came by and said it was all a misunderstanding, so we dropped the case.”

I was skeptical, but the person on the phone insisted they hadn’t made a mistake, mentioning my uncle specifically.

After hanging up, I let out a bitter laugh.

Not long after, Kairo stormed into the room, demanding an explanation.

“It’s just a dress. Did you really have to involve the police?”

“Yeah, Anaya, you agreed to let me have it. Why did you change your mind?” Arianna’s voice dripped with fake innocence.

Ignoring her, I stared straight at Kairo, my voice shaking with suppressed anger. “Just a dress? Uncle, did you even watch the footage? Do you know how that dress was taken from me?”

He was visibly impatient, his words cutting into me like a knife. “I don’t need to see it. If you want to stay here, you need to learn to get along with Arianna.”

His words felt like an invisible hand tearing my heart to shreds.

Yes, Arianna was his fiancée now.

Of course, everything would revolve around her. How foolish was I to think he would ever stand by me?

With reddened eyes, I laughed at myself, shaking my head. “Don’t worry, I won’t be staying here. I won’t have to get along with her. I’m getting married soon.”

Without waiting for Kairo’s inevitable reprimands, I turned and left him behind.

That night, I tossed and turned, unable to find peace.

As the night deepened, I woke up parched and stumbled downstairs for a glass of water.

Returning to my room, I was about to lie down when I realized something felt… off.

Startled, I looked around. The unfamiliar surroundings stunned me until I realized I had wandered into a room Kairo had always forbidden me to enter.

Panicked, I tried to leave, but my eyes caught on a string of rosary beads hanging on the wall.

My breath caught in my throat as disbelief washed over me.

How could those beads be here?!

The first time I laid eyes on those prayer beads was at my parents' funeral.Kairo had been the one my parents entrusted with my care after their passing. When he arrived to take me to the Marshall family home, the beads........

I was staying nearby for a few days last month and I was in there a couple of times for coffee in the morning. While in there, I noticed a really cool book they had, a sort of coffee table book that was an anthology of some pulp horror comic from way back. I thought it was a really cool book and I was going to look for a copy on eBay or somewhere, but I cannot remember what it was called or the name of pulp it was about, or the name of the editor.

Please, if anybody is in there anyway (and I saw some Seattleites working in there in the morning!) could you please ping me (or post here) the name of the book and any other details that would help me find it?

  
I've reached out to the folks at Monkey Grind directly but they have not responded yet, either because they didn't see the message or because they (understandably) think I am a lunatic.

By Ava Lennox","My fists tightened, knuckles whitening as my heart pounded against my ribcage, the dim glow of Caleb Lawson’s phone illuminating a secret that shattered me— my former mate, the Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack, had betrayed me. The screen blazed with a message from Esmeralda Powell, his chosen Luna: “She’s out of the picture. When do we tell them I’m carrying your heir?” Tears stung my eyes, blurring the words that unraveled every tender vow he’d made, every night I’d spent tangled in his arms believing I was his future.

# Chapter 1 - Broken Promises, Shattered Dreams

When I received Esmeralda Powell's mate-marking invitation, the Alpha’s name printed next to hers as her chosen mate sent a cold shiver down my spine. I stood in the dim light of my room, the crumpled paper trembling in my hands. My wolf stirred uneasily in the back of my mind, a low growl of protest rumbling through my thoughts. ""Caleb Lawson,"" I whispered, the name tasting like ash on my tongue. ""You’re marking her?""

Caleb, the Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack, turned to me with that infuriatingly calm expression, his piercing gaze cutting through me like a blade. ""Why not?"" he said, his voice dripping with condescension. ""Did you think I was going to mark you?""

He stepped closer, his towering frame casting a shadow over me, the scent of pine and dominance filling the air. His hands reached out to grip my shoulders, his touch both possessive and dismissive. ""Even after the marking ceremony, I’ll still keep you close,"" he said, his tone casual, as if discussing the weather. ""Isn’t it all about the pack’s benefit, after all?""

His words hit me like a blow to the chest, leaving me gasping for air. I had thought our bond was more than this—more than a calculated arrangement. My wolf whimpered, a sound only I could hear, her pain echoing my own. ""Alpha,"" I said, my voice trembling, ""we were supposed to be mates. How did it become just... this?""

Caleb’s lips curled into a smirk, his dark eyes glinting with amusement. ""Esmeralda is the only daughter of the Powell Pack, their future Luna. Mark her, and their resources are mine. Given your mother’s debts to my pack, we can keep this arrangement private, but mark you? That’s a fantasy."" He leaned in, his breath hot against my ear. ""So be wise. I won’t cast you aside—I’ll keep you by my side, just like now.""

His words, wrapped in a veneer of false generosity, finally stopped. I didn’t bother wiping away the tears that streamed down my face. Instead, I shoved his hands away, clutching the sheets around me as if they could shield me from the truth. ""What do you take me for, Alpha?"" I spat, my voice cracking. ""Your secret? Weren’t we... mates?""

My question seemed to amuse him, as he threw his head back and laughed, the sound sharp and mocking. But what he said next plunged me into a cold, suffocating despair.

""Rowan, getting all sentimental after being a bargaining chip?"" he sneered, lighting a cigarette and taking a slow drag. He exhaled the smoke in my direction, his expression turning sardonic. ""My pack needs strength, not sentimentality. Want to stay close to me? Then accept your place.""

Back then, Caleb hadn’t cared if I wanted this. He had been drawn to my resilience, my willingness to fight for my mother’s debts, and he had decided I was worth keeping around—for his benefit. Now, he thought I was soft, weak, and he was willing to discard me for a more advantageous match.

Caleb’s words squeezed the air from my lungs, suffocating me. What I had thought was a bond, a connection deeper than mere duty, had been nothing but a transaction. My mother’s debts, her desperation, had been the price, and I had been the currency.

I dressed numbly, my tears drying as a wave of nausea washed over me. Caleb’s mocking gaze no longer registered pain. I was truly on the brink of gagging.

""I’m leaving,"" I murmured, my voice hollow, as I made a hurried, humiliating exit. Outside, I leaned against the cold stone wall of the packhouse and retched. Only bile surfaced; my stomach was empty.

I had prepared a feast for tonight, waiting for Caleb to return from his duties. But he had come home only to remind me of my place. I wiped my mouth, a bitter smile tugging at my lips. I had thought our closeness, our nights together, were proof of our bond. I had never imagined it was just another deal, another calculation in the Alpha’s endless game of power.

# Chapter 2 - Fractured Trust, Shattered Dreams

The taxi ride home felt endless, the city lights blurring through my tear-streaked vision. The wind whipped through the open window, carrying the faint scent of pine—Caleb’s scent—that clung to me like a curse. My hands clenched into fists, nails digging into my palms, as memories of him flooded my mind.

When my mother’s debts to the Silver Moon Pack had spiraled out of control, Caleb, the Alpha, had stepped in. He’d offered to settle her debts in exchange for my loyalty, and I, desperate to protect her, had agreed. Over time, we’d grown closer. We exchanged secret glances at pack meetings, and after hours, we’d cook dinner together in his den, wrapped in a world that felt like it belonged only to us. I’d thought, foolishly, that I’d found happiness. That I’d found a mate.

But now, every memory felt like a lie, tainted by the mocking invitation on my phone. The mate-marking ceremony for Caleb and Esmeralda Powell, the daughter of the affluent Powell Pack, was set to take place in just a few days. The reality of it burned like a brand against my heart.

The taxi stopped in front of the crumbling apartment complex where my mother and I lived. I climbed the narrow, dimly lit stairway, each step heavier than the last. At the maroon security door, I fumbled with my key, finally unlocking it and collapsing onto the worn couch inside. I sat there, motionless, waiting for the inevitable.

It wasn’t long before Coraline Armstrong returned, humming a tune under her breath. The sound of the door closing snapped me out of my daze, and I tensed, knowing her mood would dictate how this conversation would go. Tonight, she seemed cheerful—likely because she’d won at the pack’s gambling den—and I relaxed slightly, knowing her anger wouldn’t be directed at me.

She switched on the light, her eyes widening in surprise when she saw me sitting there. “Rowan? What are you doing back so early?” she asked, her voice light but edged with curiosity.

I stared at her, my eyes swollen from crying. When I spoke, my voice was brittle, on the verge of shattering. “Did you go to Alpha Lawson for money again?”

Her movements paused as she kicked off her shoes, but she quickly recovered, her voice dripping with casual arrogance. “Oh, you found out.” She shrugged, as if it were nothing. “Well, it’s for your own good. You’ve worked hard, risen through the ranks of the pack. You’re too valuable to let anyone have for free. Those high-ranking wolves—they don’t take mates like us seriously. I’m just looking out for you.”

Her words cut deeper than any blade. I felt frozen, my limbs heavy, tears still streaming down my face. “Give me… the money,” I whispered, my voice breaking.

Coraline chuckled, a sound that made my stomach churn. “I raised you on that money, and now you look down on me? How grand.”

Yes, she’d earned quite a bit back then, only to squander it on gambling and pack debts. And I’d grown up bearing the shame, labeled as the daughter of an Omega who couldn’t keep her affairs in order. From the moment I could walk, I’d studied, trained, and worked harder than anyone else in the pack, hoping to rise above that stigma.

“Hand over that money,” I repeated, my voice trembling with anger.

Seeing my fury, Coraline shifted tactics, her face crumpling into a theatrical display of tears. “I’m a woman who worked hard to raise you all my life. What’s wrong with asking for some money?” She wailed, her cries echoing through the thin walls of the apartment. “Oh, I can’t take it anymore!”

Her performance was flawless, and soon the neighbors’ judging eyes would be on me, painting me as the ungrateful daughter mistreating her poor mother. I bent under the weight of that shame, my anger dissolving into helplessness.

The money issue remained unresolved, leaving me utterly disheartened. I glanced at my phone, where a new message awaited:

“Rowan, we really need you. Please join our team.”

It was from Eric Knight, the Gamma of the Crimson Fang Pack. A message I would have dismissed without a second thought yesterday had now become my lifeline. I stared at the screen, my heart pounding.

It was time to leave this place. Time to start over.

# Chapter 3 - Whispers of the Forgotten Bride

Esmeralda Powell’s mate-marking ceremony was a breathtaking spectacle, held in the sprawling gardens of the Powell Pack estate. The air was thick with the scent of thousands of white roses, their petals cascading over the lush green lawn like a scene from a dream. Every detail of the event was meticulously planned, exuding an elegance that spoke of wealth and power. It was the kind of ceremony I had once imagined for myself, back when I still believed Caleb Lawson and I were destined to be mates.

Now, that dream was shattered, and I stood among the crowd as nothing more than a distant memory. My colleagues from the Silver Moon Pack murmured excitedly, their voices blending with the hum of the gathering.

""My dream Alpha is finally marking his mate... I can’t believe it’s really happening.""

""Who else but the daughter of the Powell Pack could stand beside him? It’s a perfect match.""

""Honestly, look at yourself. Do you think you could ever be Luna material?""

""Snap out of it, it’s not like you ever had a chance...""

Their words weren’t directed at me, but each one cut deeper than they knew. Yes, snap out of it, Rowan. You’re nothing to him now.

Persephone Mills, a Delta in the pack and one of the few people who still treated me with kindness, pulled me back to reality. Her eyes flicked to the mark on the back of my neck, a faint but undeniable reminder of Caleb’s possessive claim. ""Rowan,"" she asked softly, ""are you seeing someone?""

I froze, my hand instinctively brushing over the mark. Memories of Caleb’s teeth grazing my skin, his voice low and commanding, flooded my mind. Before I could respond, Persephone pressed further, ""When will you introduce us to your mate?""

My eyes drifted to Caleb, who stood across the garden, his towering frame exuding the commanding presence of an Alpha. He was smiling broadly, his gaze fixed on Esmeralda. As if sensing my stare, he glanced in my direction, his expression hardening into a silent warning. Don’t cause a scene, it seemed to say.

I forced myself to look away, my voice barely audible. ""We’re not mates anymore...""

But, truth be told, we had never truly been mates. To Caleb, I was just a transaction, a means to settle my mother’s debts. Nothing more.

The crowd erupted into cheers as Caleb and Esmeralda stepped onto the raised platform at the center of the garden. He wore the blue striped tie I had given him on his last birthday, a cruel reminder of the past. His eyes were alight with a joy I had never seen directed at me, his hand resting possessively on Esmeralda’s waist. She stood beside him, radiant and regal, every inch the Luna she was destined to be.

How ironic. Just last night, Caleb had left a mark on my collarbone, his touch both punishing and possessive. In retaliation, I had scratched his back, leaving my own mark of defiance. And now, here he was, pledging himself to another.

As they began the mate-marking vows, Caleb’s voice rang out, strong and unwavering. ""I, Caleb Lawson, Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack, accept you, Esmeralda Powell, daughter of the Powell Pack, as my mate and Luna.""

The crowd erupted into applause, the sound deafening. My heart twisted painfully, and I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms. I shouldn’t have come. Yet, like a desperate fool, I had dragged myself here, craving even a shred of acknowledgment from him.

As the ceremony concluded, Caleb’s gaze met mine once more. His eyes were cold, devoid of the warmth I had once clung to. I quickly looked away, my throat tight, and took a sip of the bitter coffee in my hand.

This was my punishment, self-inflicted and unavoidable. I just wanted this nightmare to end.

# Chapter 4 - The Shadow Of A Rival

Caleb approached with Esmeralda on his arm, his towering frame commanding attention as he moved through the crowd. His piercing gaze locked onto me, a silent warning etched into his expression. Esmeralda, dressed in.........

""I Rented a Cabin with My Girlfriend… But She Was Already Dead.   The final stretch of road to the cabin was a serpent of wet asphalt, slick with a patina of fallen leaves. Autumn had bled all over the mountains, staining the world in hues of rust and gold. Beside me, Clara was silent, her gaze fixed on the dense tangle of trees blurring past her window. This trip was my idea, a desperate attempt to press the reset button on a relationship that had grown frayed and distant over the past few months. I reached across the console and took her hand. It felt like a small, cold stone in mine.     “Almost there,” I said, forcing a cheerfulness I didn't feel. “Just think—two whole days. No work, no phones, just us and a fireplace.”     She turned her head slowly, a motion that seemed to require immense effort. Her eyes, usually a vibrant, mischievous blue, were like polished glass, reflecting the dying light of the afternoon without taking any of it in. “Just us,” she echoed, her voice a monotone whisper, devoid of its usual warmth.     I squeezed her hand. No response. I dropped it back into her lap, my own fingers tingling with a strange, residual cold. I blamed the weather, the long drive, the stress we were trying to escape. An excuse for everything.     The cabin was exactly as advertised: secluded, rustic, and bordered on all sides by a dark, imposing forest. As I fumbled with the old brass key, a shiver traced its way down my spine, a cold that had nothing to do with the crisp mountain air. Inside, the air was stale and heavy. A thick layer of dust coated the pine furniture, and the great stone fireplace looked like a gaping, soot-stained mouth.     “Home sweet home,” I announced, dropping our bags. I turned to Clara, expecting a sarcastic comment or at least a roll of her eyes. Instead, she had drifted to the large picture window overlooking the woods. She stood perfectly still, her back to me, a slender silhouette against the encroaching twilight.     “Clara?”     She didn’t move. I walked over and put my hands on her shoulders. The fabric of her sweater felt impossibly cold, as if she’d been standing outside for hours.     “You okay, babe?” I asked, my voice softer now.     “They’re watching,” she murmured, her breath fogging the glass.     “Who’s watching?” I peered into the forest. There was nothing but a wall of shadow-draped trees. “It’s just the woods, hon. It gets a little spooky at dusk.”     She finally turned from the window, her face pale and impassive in the dim light. “I’m tired,” she said, and without another word, she walked into the bedroom and closed the door.     That night, my sleep was a battlefield. I was plagued by nightmares of drowning in icy water, my lungs burning for air that would never come. I’d thrash and wake up, gasping, the sheets twisted around my legs. Each time, I’d see Clara. She was sitting upright in the bed, her back ramrod straight, staring at the closed bedroom door as if expecting a visitor. She never seemed to sleep, never seemed to breathe.     The next morning, I found her in the exact same spot she’d been the night before—staring out the picture window. I’d made coffee, the rich aroma a desperate, normal-smelling anchor in the increasingly strange atmosphere of the cabin. She refused a cup. She refused the toast I made.     “You have to eat something,” I pleaded.     “I’m not hungry,” she replied, her gaze never leaving the trees. She began to hum, a low, tuneless sound that grated on my nerves. It was a melody I’d never heard, dissonant and strange.     By midday, I couldn’t take it anymore. The silence, the humming, the unnerving stillness of the woman I loved. I needed to hear another human voice. My phone, predictably, had no signal inside the cabin.     “I’m going to walk up the driveway,” I told her, grabbing my jacket. “See if I can get a signal, call my folks.”     She gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod.     The cold outside was a relief, sharp and clean. I walked a hundred yards up the gravel path until two bars flickered to life on my screen. A cascade of notifications flooded in. Voicemails, texts. Most were from work. But three were from a number I knew with a sickening lurch of my stomach: Clara’s mom.     My hands trembled as I tapped the voicemail icon. The first two were frantic, choked with tears. I clicked on the most recent one, dated from yesterday afternoon.     Her mother’s voice, a ragged, broken thing, filled my ear. “Alex… please, Alex, pick up. I… I don’t know how to tell you this. It’s Clara.” A sob tore through the speaker. “There was an accident… on Tuesday. A car… she was on her way home from work. Oh, god, Alex… she’s gone. Clara’s gone.”     The world tilted. The trees seemed to bend inwards, the sky a swirling grey vortex. Tuesday. That was three days ago. Three days before I’d picked her up for this trip. No. It was a mistake. A horrible, cruel joke.     My heart hammered against my ribs as I looked back at the cabin. And I saw her. A pale figure standing in the picture window, watching me.     Denial is a powerful anesthetic. I stumbled back towards the cabin, my mind racing, constructing a thousand logical explanations. It was a prank. Her mom was confused. It was a different Clara. Anything but the truth.     I threw open the door. “Clara!” I shouted, my voice cracking.     She was standing in the middle of the living room now, her head tilted at an unnatural angle. The humming had stopped. The air in the room was glacial, my breath pluming in front of my face.     “Clara, your mom called,” I said, my voice shaking uncontrollably. “She said… she said something crazy.”     “Did she?” The voice that answered was hers, but it was hollowed out, an echo in a deep, empty well.     “She said you were in an accident. She said you…” I couldn't finish the sentence.     The thing wearing Clara’s face smiled, and the sight of it broke something inside me. It was too wide, a grotesque slash in her pale face that didn’t reach her vacant eyes. “I was,” it said. “It was very cold. In the water.”     My nightmare. The icy drowning. It wasn’t mine.     “Who are you?” I whispered, backing away until my shoulders hit the rough-hewn wood of the door.     Its head tilted again, a dry, cracking sound like snapping twigs echoing in the dead silence. “You missed her so much,” it said, taking a gliding step towards me. Its movements were wrong—too smooth, like a puppet being pulled by unseen strings. “You were so lonely. You kept wishing she was with you, right here, right now.”     The temperature in the room plummeted. A frost pattern began to spiderweb across the windowpanes.     “You wanted her back so badly,” it continued, its voice beginning to change, layering over itself into a chorus of dry, whispering rustles. “You didn’t care what answered your wish.”     It took another step, and its form wavered, the familiar lines of Clara’s face and body seeming to blur at the edges, as if I were seeing it through heat haze. Her jaw unhinged slightly, stretching impossibly wide, and the voice that came out next was not human at all. It was the sound of wind through a graveyard, of dirt falling on a coffin lid.     “And I was so… hungry.”     I turned, my hand fumbling for the doorknob, twisting it frantically. It wouldn’t budge. I rattled it, threw my shoulder against the solid wood, but it was useless. A cold, metallic click from behind me told me why.     The key I had used to let us in was turning in the lock. From the outside.""",1,1751570028.0,realnosleep,0,1.0,False

A horrible, cruel joke.     My heart hammered against my ribs as I looked back at the cabin. And I saw her. A pale figure standing in the picture window, watching me.     Denial is a powerful anesthetic. I stumbled back towards the cabin, my mind racing, constructing a thousand logical explanations. It was a prank. Her mom was confused. It was a different Clara. Anything but the truth.     I threw open the door. “Clara!” I shouted, my voice cracking.     She was standing in the middle of the living room now, her head tilted at an unnatural angle. The humming had stopped. The air in the room was glacial, my breath pluming in front of my face.     “Clara, your mom called,” I said, my voice shaking uncontrollably. “She said… she said something crazy.”     “Did she?” The voice that answered was hers, but it was hollowed out, an echo in a deep, empty well.     “She said you were in an accident. She said you…” I couldn't finish the sentence.     The thing wearing Clara’s face smiled, and the sight of it broke something inside me. It was too wide, a grotesque slash in her pale face that didn’t reach her vacant eyes. “I was,” it said. “It was very cold. In the water.”     My nightmare. The icy drowning. It wasn’t mine.     “Who are you?” I whispered, backing away until my shoulders hit the rough-hewn wood of the door.     Its head tilted again, a dry, cracking sound like snapping twigs echoing in the dead silence. “You missed her so much,” it said, taking a gliding step towards me. Its movements were wrong—too smooth, like a puppet being pulled by unseen strings. “You were so lonely. You kept wishing she was with you, right here, right now.”     The temperature in the room plummeted. A frost pattern began to spiderweb across the windowpanes.     “You wanted her back so badly,” it continued, its voice beginning to change, layering over itself into a chorus of dry, whispering rustles. “You didn’t care what answered your wish.”     It took another step, and its form wavered, the familiar lines of Clara’s face and body seeming to blur at the edges, as if I were seeing it through heat haze. Her jaw unhinged slightly, stretching impossibly wide, and the voice that came out next was not human at all. It was the sound of wind through a graveyard, of dirt falling on a coffin lid.     “And I was so… hungry.”     I turned, my hand fumbling for the doorknob, twisting it frantically. It wouldn’t budge. I rattled it, threw my shoulder against the solid wood, but it was useless. A cold, metallic click from behind me told me why.     The key I had used to let us in was turning in the lock. From the outside.""",1,1751569910.0,spooky_stories,0,1.0,False
1lqy4im,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1lqy4im/dsp_vs_flex_masterpost_26f/,DSP vs Flex masterpost (26f),"I’ve now worked both Flex and DSP full-time (40 hours) and wanted to give my own opinion on the similarities and differences! I’m a 6’0” feminine woman (26f) for reference and I live in Seattle, so lots of city deliveries 

Overall DSP rating: 5/10
Overall Flex rating: 8/10 

DSP pay: (3/10): I got a job in Everett and the pay was $23/hour which is average for the area. However, after Washington taxes, it’s more like 19 an hour. I didn’t find the pay sufficient, though my DSP did offer bonuses.

Flex pay (10/10): In my area, Flex pay is great! Even with taxes. That’s because Seattle passed an ordinance that gig workers must be paid a minimum $25/hour and $0.75 cents per mile. I frequently get pay adjustments in the app taking an 89 dollar block up to 150+ 

DSP hours (7/10): I worked 4 days a week, 10:30am to 8:30pm. I liked having the extra 3 days off but I found myself doing Flex on those days anyway because I only got paid biweekly.

Flex hours (9/10): It is much better to work when I want with Flex and finish early and still get paid the full amount than to get off early at a DSP and be asked to do someone else’s work. 

DSP vehicle (1/10): The vans I worked in for my DSP were the old prime vans, so many had issues. On my second day, I was put in a van where the key was literally stuck in the ignition and the battery would die if I turned it off, and they still told me to go out. When I told them the van had issues they said “all of the vans have issues.” 

Flex vehicle (3/10): I can see why using your own vehicle would suck if you don’t get good gas mileage or care a lot about not harming your car but for me personally, I have a Prius and it’s a newer one, so it can get up to 50MPG. I’ve had minimal issues with my car and I love driving it. I don’t mind putting the miles on it because I’ll eventually sell it. 

DSP workload (2/10): Honestly, DSP drivers are given too much work. I was able to complete my route early every day, but early work was always rewarded with rescues of other drivers or not getting paid. My DSP did offer a 40 hour guarantee if you did well, but you’d be doing that anyway if they keep sending you to rescue. The nursery route i was given on my first day was 170 packages. On my second day, I was given practically only boxes with 184 packages; and many of them were team lift packages or bigger than my body. I ended up injuring myself. Seasoned workers were doing 250+ packages.

Flex workload (10/10): flex routes tend to be around 23-50 packages for me. It depends on the route. I also love that I can pick up Whole Foods or Amazon fresh orders and pharmacy orders and deliver less orders. The heaviest box Ive had on a flex route was 40lb and large. Bigger boxes are usually light. 

DSP training (8/10): I really enjoyed the Amazon training. They did a VR training that I found super fun and helpful, and we also did some hands on activities. However, they did have me drive a huge truck for my driver’s test which seemed unnecessary since I was only driving the vans. 

Flex training (2/10): there’s really no training for flex, and I think it’d be helpful to have all new drivers attend a one hour presentation or demonstration before working, because as an Amazon customer, I do think flex drivers do not care much about delivering properly. I always make an effort to deliver to lockers, mail rooms, and doors when I can. 

DSP work-life balance (0/10): there is no worklife balance with this job. You’re expected to make Amazon your life while they treat you like a number in a computer. They see you as easily replaceable, and they still ask superhero feats of you. I scratched a van slightly with a branch on accident and was non-chalantly told “you might or might not lose your job” with a shrug, as if he could care less about me. That’s one of the moments that made me leave. 

Flex work-life balance (10/10): I love flex’s flexibility because I’m able to deliver in my own vehicle, which means I can stop for coffee, get gas when I want, and get finished early. When I finish early, I can go do things with friends and family. No one is telling me what to do outside of small reminders from Amazon. I don’t have to let customers ruin my day, nor do they have the power to tarnish my record for no reason. 

DSP warehouse process (7/10): delivering with a DSP is pretty similar to flex. They gave me a bag in the morning with two phones, a battery pack, a gas card, and my car keys. After inspecting the van, I’d go onto the launch pad and wait for instructions to line up. After lining up, I’d find my carts and bring them to the van. It was usually 4 carts. I would fill the van in the back within 12 minutes and then bring the carts back. Then we were free to go. The only difference from flex with the app was that there was more on the Your Dashboard screen and it actually tracked my safety metrics. The camera in the van never went off for me. 

Flex warehouse process (10/10): I go to multiple warehouses in the Seattle area. I’ve gone to ones where I drive inside, ones where I line up outside, and ones where I park and walk in. I like the parking lot ones better because they tend to be better routes. The logistics stations tend to give me more boxes, but I like that they number the packages in route order like DSP. The warehouse associates sometimes treat us bad as flex workers and act like we are dumb. I remind them I’ve been a DSP driver. 

DSP health (3/10): for someone who is an athlete, I could see this job being easy. For any normal person, the amount of exercise here is very difficult. I am personally hypermobile and have POTS, so working hard is a challenge but I enjoyed it at first. However, they didn’t spend enough time in training on how to avoid injury. I ended up severely injuring my shoulder and having to leave the job after lifting a 2-person package from the back of the van. 

Flex health (10/10): I’ve rarely had a route where I felt like I was being asked to do too much. I’d say my downtown Bellevue routes are the most frustrating, as they require a lot of walking and apartment buildings. However, it’s mostly just driving to singular stops. I never got injured doing flex and never had too many packages for my ability. Even on hard days, I have the flexibility to stop for a water or drink or snack or take a short break. 

DSP team (7/10): I liked my DSP, especially my HR manager. However, it was primarily male dominated and management had a bit of an ego problem. They treated delivery associates like dumb rats sometimes, which didn’t make sense to me because they’re literally sitting on their asses all day but whatever. I get that retention is probably rough but I think it’d help if Amazon management actually cared. The actual owner of the DSP was wonderful. I didn’t get to talk to my fellow delivery associates except during training. Most people were introverted and antisocial, which is similar to flex. I didn’t expect that. 

Flex team (3/10): there’s not a sense of teamwork in flex, and everyone is constantly being pitted against each other to get routes, leading some people to get bots so they can put food on the table. 

DSP for women (4/10): As a woman, I felt like working at a DSP made me have to prove myself constantly to male employees who were my management and to customers. I was often offered help with packages when I didn’t need it and asked multiple times about my van as if I didn’t understand mechanics. For example, after having the key stuck in the ignition of my van, I reported it. 3 men tried to get the key out before they believed me. They kept saying “you can get it out, just keep trying.” Like bro… I’m a weightlifter, I’m very strong. If I can’t get it out, y’all surely can’t. There were only 2 other women in my team of about 100 drivers. 

Flex as a woman (8/10): I’ve not had many problems doing flex as a woman. No one questions me while I’m out. The only issues I’ve ever faced were people asking me if I’m new when I obviously am fine and haven’t asked for help. A lot of women seem to do flex. I’ve even seen a mom with her baby in the warehouse getting packages. 

Final thoughts: 

I am of the opinion that flex is better for those who fit these: 

-people who want flexibility
-people with family
-people who want a side hustle
-people who don’t get along with authority 
-those who want to make your own schedule
-those who get injured easily like me
-college students 
-new parents 
-immigrants
-women
-older people 
-those who cannot drive big vehicles 
-people who live in big cities 
-people who have hybrid cars or electric 

I’d recommend DSP to:

-those who want a structured schedule
-people who want a full-time job with benefits
-people who don’t know how to pay 1099 taxes
-strong people or athletes 
-men 
-people who like labor and don’t want to work in another field 

Let me know how my experiences fit yours or are different!

1lqy474,https://i.redd.it/pxbse9jbkpaf1.jpeg,"Severing the Mate Bond When His Mistress Became His New Luna
By Evelyn Harper","Three years ago, a car accident shattered Roselyn’s dreams of dancing, leaving her broken and dependent on Alpha Patrick King, leader of the Silver Moon Pack. He promised to care for her forever, but on their mating night, he abandoned her to attend the debut of Ivanna Shaw, the new lead dancer. Betrayed and humiliated, Roselyn uncovers a devastating truth: Patrick was behind the accident that destroyed her life. Now, she seeks to sever their mate bond and make him pay. But as secrets unravel and tensions rise, Roselyn must confront the man she once trusted—and the darkness he hides. Will she reclaim her freedom, or will Patrick’s dominance crush her completely?

# Chapter 1 - The Shattered Bond and Hidden Truth

The car accident three years ago shattered my dreams of ever stepping onto the stage I loved so dearly.

Alpha Patrick King, leader of the Silver Moon Pack, told me it was just an unfortunate accident, and that if I became his mate, he would take care of me for the rest of my life.

But on our mating night, he left me alone to attend the debut performance of Ivanna Shaw, the company’s new lead dancer.

When I presented the papers to sever our mate bond and set us free, Alpha Patrick flew into a rage, demanding to know why I didn’t love him anymore, why I wanted to break the bond.

Why? Because back then, I didn’t know that he was the one who had crushed my dreams with his own hands.

Now that the truth is out, of course I want to sever the bond, and more than that, I want Alpha Patrick to lose everything.

==============================

On the night of our mating ceremony, Alpha Patrick didn’t come home.

Instead, he went to support Ivanna Shaw’s debut performance as the new lead dancer.

I stared at the gossip news popping up on my phone.

""Why did Alpha King abandon his new mate on their mating night to attend Ivanna Shaw’s performance?""

""Is there something going on between Alpha King and Ivanna Shaw?""

""Was Alpha King’s mating to his new mate truly out of love?""

I couldn’t believe it. Alpha Patrick had always been so good to me, never putting me in such an embarrassing position before.

But the Alpha Patrick who had just completed our mating ceremony today seemed like a completely different wolf.

In disbelief, I called Alpha Patrick’s number.

A girl answered on the other end—it was Ivanna Shaw.

She said Alpha Patrick was in the shower and wouldn’t be coming home tonight.

Then, what sounded like Alpha Patrick’s voice came through, distant, as if he was far away.

He was telling Ivanna to hurry up and shower, as if he couldn’t wait.

I didn’t want to hear anymore and frantically ended the call.

Just like that, Alpha Patrick didn’t come home that night.

The next day, even more explosive gossip headlines dominated the news.

""Famous dancer Ivanna Shaw spotted leaving a hotel with a wolf suspected to be Alpha King.""

The news was sensational, but my heart was frozen.

Alpha Patrick, why did you go through all the trouble to be so good to me, only to abandon me like this after we completed the mating ceremony?

I wanted to call Alpha Patrick and get some answers.

After more than a dozen unanswered calls, Alpha Patrick’s Beta called me to say that Alpha Patrick’s phone was with him.

Alpha Patrick was in a meeting and couldn’t take my calls, so I should stop calling.

It felt like Alpha Patrick was deliberately avoiding me, so I decided to go to his office.

But when I arrived at his company, there was no meeting happening in the conference room.

In Alpha Patrick’s office, however, there was another she-wolf—Ivanna Shaw.

# Chapter 2 - The Shattered Vows of an Alpha

When I pushed open the office door, Ivanna Shaw was perched on Alpha Patrick’s lap, her voice sweet and pleading as she asked him to throw a celebration party for her. Alpha Patrick, noticing the intrusion, immediately grabbed a folder from his desk and hurled it toward the door without even looking up.

""Didn’t I say no one was allowed in? Mitchell Hughes, are you trying to get yourself demoted?""

His voice carried the sharp edge of an Alpha tone, commanding and unforgiving. He didn’t even bother to see who had entered, his irritation palpable at being interrupted. The folder struck my leg, and the sharp pain made me wince. Only then did Alpha Patrick glance toward the door.

I demanded to know why.

Ivanna, sensing the tension, tried to make herself scarce. In a syrupy voice, she told Alpha Patrick she’d be waiting for him in their usual hotel room that evening, adding that she didn’t want to intrude on our conversation. But as she attempted to stand and leave, Alpha Patrick’s hand firmly gripped her waist, pulling her back.

""She can hear this,"" he said, his voice icy, the Alpha tone lacing his words with authority.

The pressure of his hand made Ivanna let out a soft gasp. Alpha Patrick didn’t answer my question, but his hands continued to roam over Ivanna’s body, shameless and deliberate. My face burned with anger and humiliation as I yanked Ivanna away from him.

I stared at Alpha Patrick and demanded again, ""Why? Why are you doing this to me?""

He looked at me, his expression cold and detached, and said, ""Now it’s your turn to know what it feels like to be ignored.""

With that, he shoved me aside, wrapped his arm around Ivanna, and strode out of the office, his Alpha aura radiating dominance and dismissal.

Alpha Patrick’s sudden change in behavior left me stunned. Just two days ago, he had been tender, calling me Roselyn, promising to love and care for me for the rest of my life. He had vowed to help me overcome the shadow of the accident, to stand by me as I healed. But as soon as the mating ceremony ended, everything seemed to shift.

As I left his office, I overheard some pack members whispering. They said that since I could no longer dance, I was worthless. Ivanna, on the other hand, had both beauty and talent. She was the rising star of the dance world, and she had been openly in love with Alpha Patrick since she was eighteen, her devotion unwavering.

Alpha Patrick had endured my stubborn and difficult personality for three years, and now he had finally seen the light. Falling for Ivanna wasn’t surprising.

But if he loved her so much, why had he mated with me first, only to openly flaunt his affair with her afterward?

I wandered the streets in a daze, memories of the past three years flooding my mind. The weight of Alpha Patrick’s betrayal pressed heavily on my chest, and I could feel my wolf stirring in the back of my mind, a low growl of pain and confusion.

She doesn’t deserve this, my wolf murmured, her voice weak but defiant.

I didn’t know how to respond. All I knew was that the Alpha I thought I loved was gone, replaced by a cold, calculating wolf who seemed determined to break me.

# Chapter 3 - The Shattered Dance of Possession

When the car accident occurred, I wasn’t alone in the car—my senior from the dance company, Jesse Mendez, was with me. Jesse was two years ahead of me, and I had just started making a name for myself in the company.

I had saved up a year’s worth of my internship salary to ask Jesse to help me buy a watch. It was from a luxury brand, and Jesse mentioned he knew a sales associate who could get me one without the usual waitlist. In exchange, I had to help him train for a duet for two months—his partner had relapsed with an old injury, and he needed someone to practice with. I agreed.

For the next two months, on top of my own training, I spent an extra two hours every day practicing with Jesse. Two days before Alpha Patrick’s birthday, Jesse told me he had arranged with the sales associate, and we could go pick up the watch that day.

But on our way to the mall, the accident happened. Jesse was immediately taken away by his family, while I lay unconscious in the hospital for a full day and night before I woke up.

When I came to, Alpha Patrick looked at me with a strange expression and told me I’d never be able to dance again. Hearing that, I lost it, trying to stand up to prove I could. But my legs, encased in casts, wouldn’t budge. Any attempt to move sent sharp, searing pain through them.

From that day on, I became withdrawn, speaking very little. The only thing that gnawed at me was guilt over Jesse. He didn’t have to come with me that day. It was because he was helping me buy a gift for Alpha Patrick that he got caught in the accident.

Whenever I brought up Jesse, Alpha Patrick’s face would darken. He told me Jesse came from a prominent werewolf family in the city and would be fine—he had already been sent abroad for treatment.

Under Alpha Patrick’s meticulous care, I was discharged from the hospital. He brought me to his villa, hiring a housekeeper to look after me while he was at work. No matter how busy he was, he always came home to have dinner with me and made sure I had warm coffee in the morning.

He took care of me like this for three years, helping me let go of my obsession and convincing me to accept the mate bond, to live a simple, happy life together.

But in the past few days, Alpha Patrick’s personality had changed drastically, hitting me like a bolt out of the blue. I was caught completely off guard, unable to make sense of what was happening.

When I returned home, drenched from the rain, I was in a daze. I wanted to go to my room and change my clothes. But when I opened the door, Alpha Patrick was there, and my computer was still on.

He had gone through my email history. He knew I was still in touch with Jesse. Jesse’s rehabilitation abroad was going well, and I wanted to ask if there was still a chance for me to return to the stage.

Seeing me nervously checking my email for a reply, Alpha Patrick suddenly lunged at me like an enraged wolf, pinning me down on the bed. His eyes were bloodshot as he demanded, “Why? I’ve taken care of you for three years. We’re mated now, and you’re still thinking about going abroad to find Jesse?”

His Alpha tone was sharp, cutting through the air like a command I couldn’t ignore. The weight of his dominance pressed down on me, making it hard to breathe.

“Alpha Patrick,” I whispered, my voice trembling, “I just wanted to know if I could dance again. That’s all.”

But he didn’t seem to hear me. His grip tightened, his Alpha aura suffocating as he growled, “You’re mine, Roselyn. You don’t need to dance. You don’t need Jesse. You only need me.”

The words echoed in my mind, a cruel reminder of the bond we shared—a bond that now felt more like a chain. My wolf stirred in the back of my mind, a low whimper of pain and confusion.

She doesn’t deserve this, my wolf murmured, her voice weak but defiant.

I didn’t know how to respond. All I knew was that the Alpha I thought I loved was gone, replaced by a cold, possessive wolf who seemed determined to break me.

# Chapter 4 - A Storm of Misunderstanding and Control

I think Alpha Patrick must have lost his mind. I just wanted to ask Jesse about my rehabilitation—what did he mean by going abroad to find him?I tried to break free from his grip, but the harder I struggled, the tighter he held

""I Rented a Cabin with My Girlfriend… But She Was Already Dead.   The final stretch of road to the cabin was a serpent of wet asphalt, slick with a patina of fallen leaves. Autumn had bled all over the mountains, staining the world in hues of rust and gold. Beside me, Clara was silent, her gaze fixed on the dense tangle of trees blurring past her window. This trip was my idea, a desperate attempt to press the reset button on a relationship that had grown frayed and distant over the past few months. I reached across the console and took her hand. It felt like a small, cold stone in mine.     “Almost there,” I said, forcing a cheerfulness I didn't feel. “Just think—two whole days. No work, no phones, just us and a fireplace.”     She turned her head slowly, a motion that seemed to require immense effort. Her eyes, usually a vibrant, mischievous blue, were like polished glass, reflecting the dying light of the afternoon without taking any of it in. “Just us,” she echoed, her voice a monotone whisper, devoid of its usual warmth.     I squeezed her hand. No response. I dropped it back into her lap, my own fingers tingling with a strange, residual cold. I blamed the weather, the long drive, the stress we were trying to escape. An excuse for everything.     The cabin was exactly as advertised: secluded, rustic, and bordered on all sides by a dark, imposing forest. As I fumbled with the old brass key, a shiver traced its way down my spine, a cold that had nothing to do with the crisp mountain air. Inside, the air was stale and heavy. A thick layer of dust coated the pine furniture, and the great stone fireplace looked like a gaping, soot-stained mouth.     “Home sweet home,” I announced, dropping our bags. I turned to Clara, expecting a sarcastic comment or at least a roll of her eyes. Instead, she had drifted to the large picture window overlooking the woods. She stood perfectly still, her back to me, a slender silhouette against the encroaching twilight.     “Clara?”     She didn’t move. I walked over and put my hands on her shoulders. The fabric of her sweater felt impossibly cold, as if she’d been standing outside for hours.     “You okay, babe?” I asked, my voice softer now.     “They’re watching,” she murmured, her breath fogging the glass.     “Who’s watching?” I peered into the forest. There was nothing but a wall of shadow-draped trees. “It’s just the woods, hon. It gets a little spooky at dusk.”     She finally turned from the window, her face pale and impassive in the dim light. “I’m tired,” she said, and without another word, she walked into the bedroom and closed the door.     That night, my sleep was a battlefield. I was plagued by nightmares of drowning in icy water, my lungs burning for air that would never come. I’d thrash and wake up, gasping, the sheets twisted around my legs. Each time, I’d see Clara. She was sitting upright in the bed, her back ramrod straight, staring at the closed bedroom door as if expecting a visitor. She never seemed to sleep, never seemed to breathe.     The next morning, I found her in the exact same spot she’d been the night before—staring out the picture window. I’d made coffee, the rich aroma a desperate, normal-smelling anchor in the increasingly strange atmosphere of the cabin. She refused a cup. She refused the toast I made.     “You have to eat something,” I pleaded.     “I’m not hungry,” she replied, her gaze never leaving the trees. She began to hum, a low, tuneless sound that grated on my nerves. It was a melody I’d never heard, dissonant and strange.     By midday, I couldn’t take it anymore. The silence, the humming, the unnerving stillness of the woman I loved. I needed to hear another human voice. My phone, predictably, had no signal inside the cabin.     “I’m going to walk up the driveway,” I told her, grabbing my jacket. “See if I can get a signal, call my folks.”     She gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod.     The cold outside was a relief, sharp and clean. I walked a hundred yards up the gravel path until two bars flickered to life on my screen. A cascade of notifications flooded in. Voicemails, texts. Most were from work. But three were from a number I knew with a sickening lurch of my stomach: Clara’s mom.     My hands trembled as I tapped the voicemail icon. The first two were frantic, choked with tears. I clicked on the most recent one, dated from yesterday afternoon.     Her mother’s voice, a ragged, broken thing, filled my ear. “Alex… please, Alex, pick up. I… I don’t know how to tell you this. It’s Clara.” A sob tore through the speaker. “There was an accident… on Tuesday. A car… she was on her way home from work. Oh, god, Alex… she’s gone. Clara’s gone.”     The world tilted. The trees seemed to bend inwards, the sky a swirling grey vortex. Tuesday. That was three days ago. Three days before I’d picked her up for this trip. No. It was a mistake. A horrible, cruel joke.     My heart hammered against my ribs as I looked back at the cabin. And I saw her. A pale figure standing in the picture window, watching me.     Denial is a powerful anesthetic. I stumbled back towards the cabin, my mind racing, constructing a thousand logical explanations. It was a prank. Her mom was confused. It was a different Clara. Anything but the truth.     I threw open the door. “Clara!” I shouted, my voice cracking.     She was standing in the middle of the living room now, her head tilted at an unnatural angle. The humming had stopped. The air in the room was glacial, my breath pluming in front of my face.     “Clara, your mom called,” I said, my voice shaking uncontrollably. “She said… she said something crazy.”     “Did she?” The voice that answered was hers, but it was hollowed out, an echo in a deep, empty well.     “She said you were in an accident. She said you…” I couldn't finish the sentence.     The thing wearing Clara’s face smiled, and the sight of it broke something inside me. It was too wide, a grotesque slash in her pale face that didn’t reach her vacant eyes. “I was,” it said. “It was very cold. In the water.”     My nightmare. The icy drowning. It wasn’t mine.     “Who are you?” I whispered, backing away until my shoulders hit the rough-hewn wood of the door.     Its head tilted again, a dry, cracking sound like snapping twigs echoing in the dead silence. “You missed her so much,” it said, taking a gliding step towards me. Its movements were wrong—too smooth, like a puppet being pulled by unseen strings. “You were so lonely. You kept wishing she was with you, right here, right now.”     The temperature in the room plummeted. A frost pattern began to spiderweb across the windowpanes.     “You wanted her back so badly,” it continued, its voice beginning to change, layering over itself into a chorus of dry, whispering rustles. “You didn’t care what answered your wish.”     It took another step, and its form wavered, the familiar lines of Clara’s face and body seeming to blur at the edges, as if I were seeing it through heat haze. Her jaw unhinged slightly, stretching impossibly wide, and the voice that came out next was not human at all. It was the sound of wind through a graveyard, of dirt falling on a coffin lid.     “And I was so… hungry.”     I turned, my hand fumbling for the doorknob, twisting it frantically. It wouldn’t budge. I rattled it, threw my shoulder against the solid wood, but it was useless. A cold, metallic click from behind me told me why.     The key I had used to let us in was turning in the lock.

1lqy3lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1lqy3lf/western_game_developers_are_doing_something_wrong/,Western game developers are doing something wrong,"The recent small-team and smaller-budget success of Expedition 33 and then KCD2 as well, not to mention the relatively quick development timelines for excellent games like Lies of P, has only reinforced my befuddlement at the progress, or lack of progress, western game dev studios are making. These guys are getting paid much higher salaries, have much larger teams in many cases, and yet need a decade to complete a game these days. 

Now there’s a rumor flying around that the Perfect Dark trailer from last year was totally fake and had no resemblance to the actual game, whatever there is of it so far. So what were those devs doing this whole time if the studio is still incapable of showing snippets of a game that should be very close to releasing by now?  

Of course Microsoft and other leadership share a large part of the blame as well, but that’s because they failed to monitor these devs and see what the hell they’re doing over there and how long their coffee breaks are shaping out to be (don’t take it literally).

Something doesn’t add up…


EDIT: it looks like I might’ve given a convenient deflection for those who would like to argue my point. I stupidly titled it Western even though I meant US-based (as the majority of yesterday’s layoffs impacted US-based game devs)…",0,1751569827.0,Games,102,0.16,False
1lqy2r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFlexDrivers/comments/1lqy2r6/flex_vs_dsp_masterpost/,Flex vs DSP masterpost,"I’ve now worked both Flex and DSP full-time (40 hours) and wanted to give my own opinion on the similarities and differences! I’m a 6’0” feminine woman (26f) for reference and I live in Seattle, so lots of city deliveries 

Overall DSP rating: 5/10
Overall Flex rating: 8/10 

DSP pay: (3/10): I got a job in Everett and the pay was $23/hour which is average for the area. However, after Washington taxes, it’s more like 19 an hour. I didn’t find the pay sufficient, though my DSP did offer bonuses.

Flex pay (10/10): In my area, Flex pay is great! Even with taxes. That’s because Seattle passed an ordinance that gig workers must be paid a minimum $25/hour and $0.75 cents per mile. I frequently get pay adjustments in the app taking an 89 dollar block up to 150+ 

DSP hours (7/10): I worked 4 days a week, 10:30am to 8:30pm. I liked having the extra 3 days off but I found myself doing Flex on those days anyway because I only got paid biweekly.

Flex hours (9/10): It is much better to work when I want with Flex and finish early and still get paid the full amount than to get off early at a DSP and be asked to do someone else’s work. 

DSP vehicle (1/10): The vans I worked in for my DSP were the old prime vans, so many had issues. On my second day, I was put in a van where the key was literally stuck in the ignition and the battery would die if I turned it off, and they still told me to go out. When I told them the van had issues they said “all of the vans have issues.” 

Flex vehicle (3/10): I can see why using your own vehicle would suck if you don’t get good gas mileage or care a lot about not harming your car but for me personally, I have a Prius and it’s a newer one, so it can get up to 50MPG. I’ve had minimal issues with my car and I love driving it. I don’t mind putting the miles on it because I’ll eventually sell it. 

DSP workload (2/10): Honestly, DSP drivers are given too much work. I was able to complete my route early every day, but early work was always rewarded with rescues of other drivers or not getting paid. My DSP did offer a 40 hour guarantee if you did well, but you’d be doing that anyway if they keep sending you to rescue. The nursery route i was given on my first day was 170 packages. On my second day, I was given practically only boxes with 184 packages; and many of them were team lift packages or bigger than my body. I ended up injuring myself. Seasoned workers were doing 250+ packages.

Flex workload (10/10): flex routes tend to be around 23-50 packages for me. It depends on the route. I also love that I can pick up Whole Foods or Amazon fresh orders and pharmacy orders and deliver less orders. The heaviest box Ive had on a flex route was 40lb and large. Bigger boxes are usually light. 

DSP training (8/10): I really enjoyed the Amazon training. They did a VR training that I found super fun and helpful, and we also did some hands on activities. However, they did have me drive a huge truck for my driver’s test which seemed unnecessary since I was only driving the vans. 

Flex training (2/10): there’s really no training for flex, and I think it’d be helpful to have all new drivers attend a one hour presentation or demonstration before working, because as an Amazon customer, I do think flex drivers do not care much about delivering properly. I always make an effort to deliver to lockers, mail rooms, and doors when I can. 

DSP work-life balance (0/10): there is no worklife balance with this job. You’re expected to make Amazon your life while they treat you like a number in a computer. They see you as easily replaceable, and they still ask superhero feats of you. I scratched a van slightly with a branch on accident and was non-chalantly told “you might or might not lose your job” with a shrug, as if he could care less about me. That’s one of the moments that made me leave. 

Flex work-life balance (10/10): I love flex’s flexibility because I’m able to deliver in my own vehicle, which means I can stop for coffee, get gas when I want, and get finished early. When I finish early, I can go do things with friends and family. No one is telling me what to do outside of small reminders from Amazon. I don’t have to let customers ruin my day, nor do they have the power to tarnish my record for no reason. 

DSP warehouse process (7/10): delivering with a DSP is pretty similar to flex. They gave me a bag in the morning with two phones, a battery pack, a gas card, and my car keys. After inspecting the van, I’d go onto the launch pad and wait for instructions to line up. After lining up, I’d find my carts and bring them to the van. It was usually 4 carts. I would fill the van in the back within 12 minutes and then bring the carts back. Then we were free to go. The only difference from flex with the app was that there was more on the Your Dashboard screen and it actually tracked my safety metrics. The camera in the van never went off for me. 

Flex warehouse process (10/10): I go to multiple warehouses in the Seattle area. I’ve gone to ones where I drive inside, ones where I line up outside, and ones where I park and walk in. I like the parking lot ones better because they tend to be better routes. The logistics stations tend to give me more boxes, but I like that they number the packages in route order like DSP. The warehouse associates sometimes treat us bad as flex workers and act like we are dumb. I remind them I’ve been a DSP driver. 

DSP health (3/10): for someone who is an athlete, I could see this job being easy. For any normal person, the amount of exercise here is very difficult. I am personally hypermobile and have POTS, so working hard is a challenge but I enjoyed it at first. However, they didn’t spend enough time in training on how to avoid injury. I ended up severely injuring my shoulder and having to leave the job after lifting a 2-person package from the back of the van. 

Flex health (10/10): I’ve rarely had a route where I felt like I was being asked to do too much. I’d say my downtown Bellevue routes are the most frustrating, as they require a lot of walking and apartment buildings. However, it’s mostly just driving to singular stops. I never got injured doing flex and never had too many packages for my ability. Even on hard days, I have the flexibility to stop for a water or drink or snack or take a short break. 

DSP team (7/10): I liked my DSP, especially my HR manager. However, it was primarily male dominated and management had a bit of an ego problem. They treated delivery associates like dumb rats sometimes, which didn’t make sense to me because they’re literally sitting on their asses all day but whatever. I get that retention is probably rough but I think it’d help if Amazon management actually cared. The actual owner of the DSP was wonderful. I didn’t get to talk to my fellow delivery associates except during training. Most people were introverted and antisocial, which is similar to flex. I didn’t expect that. 

Flex team (3/10): there’s not a sense of teamwork in flex, and everyone is constantly being pitted against each other to get routes, leading some people to get bots so they can put food on the table. 

DSP for women (4/10): As a woman, I felt like working at a DSP made me have to prove myself constantly to male employees who were my management and to customers. I was often offered help with packages when I didn’t need it and asked multiple times about my van as if I didn’t understand mechanics. For example, after having the key stuck in the ignition of my van, I reported it. 3 men tried to get the key out before they believed me. They kept saying “you can get it out, just keep trying.” Like bro… I’m a weightlifter, I’m very strong. If I can’t get it out, y’all surely can’t. There were only 2 other women in my team of about 100 drivers. 

Flex as a woman (8/10): I’ve not had many problems doing flex as a woman. No one questions me while I’m out. The only issues I’ve ever faced were people asking me if I’m new when I obviously am fine and haven’t asked for help. A lot of women seem to do flex. I’ve even seen a mom with her baby in the warehouse getting packages. 

Final thoughts: 

I am of the opinion that flex is better for those who fit these: 

-people who want flexibility
-people with family
-people who want a side hustle
-people who don’t get along with authority 
-those who want to make your own schedule
-those who get injured easily like me
-college students 
-new parents 
-immigrants
-women
-older people 
-those who cannot drive big vehicles 
-people who live in big cities 
-people who have hybrid cars or electric 

I’d recommend DSP to:

-those who want a structured schedule
-people who want a full-time job with benefits
-people who don’t know how to pay 1099 taxes
-strong people or athletes 
-men 
-people who like labor and don’t want to work in another field 

Let me know how my experiences fit yours or are different!

The padron did come in with a fair amount of fine white dust on the wrapper (which i can only assume is mold). I brushed it off, since it wasn't at all on/in the foot (and then stupidly un-cello'd and touched a few other cigars, which have now been wiped with tissues and put back in the tupperdor with their cellos on). I'll keep watch on the other sticks to see if any mold situation develops in the tupperdor. Will probably smoke the padron in the next couple days instead of letting it sit with the others- I was planning on aging the Padron but I assume thats a bad idea with the mystery white dust it came with. Let me know if there's anything I should do, either now or in the future if something like that happens again.

Also, the espinosa azucar was in the same bag as the rest of the cigars. The bag was rather vanilla-y but the cigars themselves don't seem to have picked up much of the vanilla scent. I assume after a month and a half resting in the tupperdor any scent they may have picked up will be gone.",4,1751569750.0,cigar_refuge,0,1.0,False

 i think my main reason for this is nabobored lang talaga ako kaya gusto ko may iniinom or kinakain. still, mahirap pa rin solusyonan

1lqy1hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kanairy/comments/1lqy1hz/they_used_his_voice_to_bring_me_there/,They Used His Voice to Bring Me There,"It always starts the same.

A hush so deep it presses against my ribs, like it knows what I've lost. I move through the dark without moving, pulled forward by something I can't name. Something that reminds me.

Sometimes, I hear my father's voice—not words, just the sound of breath behind a wall, a shape in the silence.

Then she appears.

Small. Still. Watching.

I never see her arrive. She's just there, like the dream belongs to her and I'm only borrowing it. She raises one hand, slow and steady, like she's reaching across time and not waving. Not warning.

Just calling me back.

I always wake up before I get to him. And every time, I forget a little more.

Lately, I've been sleeping more than I'm awake.

It's not real sleep, not rest. It feels more like falling through water, slow, silent, and heavy. Like the world has softened, I'm waiting for the current to decide whether I will drift or drown.

I stopped going to school two weeks ago. My mom calls it temporary. She says I need time. She still leaves the house every morning in her scrubs, coffee in one hand, keys in the other. Sometimes she kisses my forehead on the way out. Sometimes she forgets.

She works nights now. Extra shifts at the hospital, even though the ones she already works, leave her eyes red and her voice hoarse. She leaves notes on the counter, folded beside a chipped mug or a bottle of vitamins.

Soup in the fridge.

Try showering today.

I love you.

I read them. I don't always listen.

The dreams started after my father vanished. I don't say he left anymore. People who leave say goodbye. They leave doors half open and photos on the fridge. They don't disappear into silence that stretches across years. They don't show up in dreams, calling you from the end of a hallway that shouldn't exist.

The girl is always there. Pale as salt. Eyes like quiet static. She never blinks. Never speaks. She stands between me and whatever I'm chasing. Usually, my father. Always too far away. Her presence hums behind my ribs like the moment before a power outage.

However, the dream is changing now. The hallway breathes. I smell dust, warm wood, and something like flowers that died in a locked room. I hear the floors creak under feet I never see. The air feels swollen with memory.

And she's getting closer.

Each night, the distance between us shrinks. She never walks. She never needs to. Even when I'm awake, I feel her now like she's stretched beyond the dream. Like I'm carrying her with me.

Last night, she brought someone else.

A woman stood just behind her, tall and silent. Her dress was pressed. Her hair was pinned. Her lipstick was the kind you only see in black-and-white photos. She didn't look confused or frightened. She looked placed, like someone had arranged her intentionally—a doll in the wrong decade.

She didn't speak.

But she smiled.

And in her hands was an envelope.

I woke up clutching it like it had always been mine.

I didn't open it at first.

I left it on the nightstand, untouched. For hours, I just watched it from the corner of my eye, half-expecting it to move on its own. It felt too still. Too aware. Like it was waiting for me to turn my back.

The paper looked aged, but not worn. The kind you'd find pressed between pages of a forgotten book. Thick and cream-colored. Almost soft. There was no stamp. No seal. Just my name, written in hand, too careful for my world. Not quite cursive, not quite print. Something in between. Something older. Something slower.

For a moment, I tried to believe my mom had left it. Maybe this was her attempt at comfort, a new tactic, some gentle strategy picked up from a grief counselor between night shifts and overtime. But the moment I looked at it again, that excuse unraveled.

She doesn't write like that. Not anymore.

She barely writes at all.

The envelope smelled faintly of dust and perfume. Not the kind you find in stores, but the kind that clings to the backs of closets and lined purses passed down between generations. A scent meant to make you remember something you were never part of.

I told myself I'd read it later, that it could wait. But it didn't stay. It settled into the air like fog. It filled the corners of the room, thick and invisible. It nested in the quiet. It watched me when I wasn't looking.

Even when I turned away, I could feel it reaching past my skin and finding its way inside, not with force or sound, just presence.

It didn't ask me to open it. It never asked.

But something in me had already.

And I knew, without reason, proof, or language, that the longer I left it sealed, the nearer she would come.

When I opened the envelope, the air in the room changed.

Something in it shifted, thickened, like the moment before a storm when even the dust knows to be quiet. My fingers moved without hesitation, but the rest of me stayed frozen, like unfolding the paper had locked everything else in place.

The note was impossibly clean, folded with care, not rushed, not torn—a message meant to last.

Two lines, centered.

***Please don't keep me waiting, bug.***

***Holloway Street***

I read it once.

And then again.

The second time, the words sank.

That was what he used to call me.

***Bug***.

His little bug. Always with a lopsided grin. Always with that casual, unshakable love that only lived in his voice. He'd say it at the bottom of the stairs when I tied my shoes too long. In the car, if I stared too long out the window. When I was quiet. When I was scared.

***Please don't keep me waiting, bug.***

I hadn't heard those words in years. Not since the night he disappeared. Not since silence became his answer to everything.

And now they were here. Neatly typed and pressed into paper that smelled like dust, perfume, and something older than grief.

Something used to get what it wants.

The room darkened at the edges—not visibly but emotionally. It was as if something inside me had pulled the curtains, something more than I could read, like the note had said.

Because I knew, I knew.

This wasn't a message from him.

It was a trick—a voice wearing his skin. A memory repurposed into a hook.

They took him to get to me.

The girl. The dream. Her mother was in the hallway, wearing red lipstick and a smile that didn't belong to this century.

He was the opening act.

And now it was my turn.

I reread the note.

***Please don't keep me waiting, bug.***  
***Holloway Street.***

I said the name aloud, testing it in the air like a key in the wrong lock: Holloway. It didn't sound real, but it didn't sound made up either. It was just misplaced, like something I should've known once and forgotten too long ago to get back.

I searched for it online, on my phone, and even in the back corners of memory, where dreams go to rot.  
Nothing.  
No Holloway Street in town. No Holloway nearby. Not one that made sense. Not one that felt like *this* did.

But I kept thinking about the hallway, the girl, and the dreams starting to fold themselves tighter around my life, curling in like ivy on a shuttered house. I remembered how the world felt thicker each time I saw her, the walls more real, the silence more carved.

And I wondered.

What if Holloway wasn't a street you could drive to?  
What if it wasn't on a map at all—just tucked somewhere in the folds between sleep and memory?

The girl always waited silently—the mother, too calm, composed. And now my father's voice echoed in my head like it had never left.

Maybe the house wasn't out there. Perhaps it was already built inside me. Maybe it had always been there, just waiting to be found.

All I had to do was ask.

So I did.  
I lay in bed that night with the note pressed flat to my chest like it might melt through my skin. The paper could slip into my blood if I held it tight enough.

I stared at the ceiling. I whispered it.

""Take me to Holloway Street.""

Nothing moved. Not right away. But something shifted.  
A hush rolled across the house, heavier than silence, deeper than quiet. It didn't feel empty.  
It felt like breath being held.  
Like the world was listening.  
Like it had always been waiting.

When sleep came, it didn't pull.  
It swallowed.

 

I opened my eyes to somewhere else.

Not suddenly. Not with a jolt. Just a slow, sinking shift. Like waking inside a breath I hadn't meant to take.

The street was quiet.

Too quiet.

Not the kind that comes from peace, but the type that feels assigned. Scripted. Like someone had built this silence deliberately and left it here for me to find.

It was a neighborhood, or at least a version of one. Pale houses lined the road in soft symmetry, each with manicured lawns and wraparound porches. Their white railings were bone-pure beneath a gray-blue sky that never moved. Everything was neat and precise, and nothing was out of place.

The air smelled faintly of fabric softener and wilting lilacs. Sweet, but fading.

I walked slowly.

The sidewalks were clean. The trees are evenly spaced—the fences are all equal and of perfect height. But something in the paint felt too fresh. Too careful. Like it hadn't aged—just waited.

No wind. No cars. No birdsong. Not even the distant hum of electricity.

This place was frozen—not in time but in intention. Every detail was curated to feel familiar but softened at the edges like a memory retold too many times.

The houses watched me.

I could feel it.

Somewhere, a curtain shifted without sound. A front door clicked behind its frame and stayed closed. A rocking chair swayed once, then stopped.

And then I saw it.

The house.

Yellow siding, white trim, and a porch swing hanging still in the heavy air. The curtains in the front window were lace, and they didn't move.

It didn't look different from the others, not really. But I knew.

This was the one.

The house was waiting for me.

The front door was cracked open—not wide, just enough to say, ""We knew you'd come.""

I stepped onto the porch.

The boards didn't creak. The air didn't shift. The swing didn't stir.

But I heard something inside the house beneath the floorboards and soft shadows.

A voice.

Not clear, not loud, but close.

You coming, bug?

My chest folded in on itself.

I didn't answer.  
Because it wasn't the voice that scared me.  
It was how badly I wanted it to be real.

That was the part that hurt.

Not the stillness of the house, not the silence folded neatly into the corners, not even the strange, perfect glow spilling through the lace curtains.

It was hope. The sharp kind. The kind that flinches when touched.

So, I stepped forward.

Not because I trusted it. But because some part of me needed to believe he might still be somewhere, waiting.

The porch didn't creak. The floor didn't shift. Everything held its breath as I crossed the threshold.  
And the door closed behind me like it had been waiting for years to do so.

The air inside the house was warm, but not with life. It was the warmth of something sealed, something preserved. Every surface was too clean, every edge too soft. Wallpaper lined the walls in delicate rose bouquets, faded at the edges like they were tired of being looked at.

My steps sank into the rug. Slow, muffled. The fibers swallowed sound, like the house was hungry for silence.

And then,

A noise. Almost nothing. A distant pulse of something that didn't belong.

Not a dream-sound. Not part of the script.

A tone, maybe. Or a mechanical chirp. Something sharp pressed flat under layers of velvet.

It faded before I could hold onto it.

At the far end of the hall, she stood waiting.

The mother.

Her silhouette glowed in the threshold of a room lit with warm amber, the kind of light meant to soften the truth of things. Her dress was the same blue. Her smile was practiced and pleasant, stretched just wide enough to suggest affection without touching the eyes. Her hair didn't move.

""I'm so glad you came,"" she said.

Her voice was the color of tea left too long in the sun. Sweet, but steeped in something bitter.

I didn't answer.

The air was thick with scent. Powder and sugar, roses, something beneath it—sour and old. Like perfume clinging to a dress that had been buried and dug up again.

She stepped forward with open arms.

""You look tired. Come in, love. Let me help. It's all ready. Just for you.""

Something inside me pulled taut.

Another sound reached me. Far away.

Not sharp this time. A shuffle. A scrape. Rubber on tile. The wet rustle of fabric.

Then a voice. Not hers. Not in this place.

Cassie.

Soft. Muffled. But mine.

The mother flinched.

It was small—a crack in porcelain. But I saw it.

Her smile twitched too far. Her eyelid spasmed once. Her fingers curled tighter around the edge of the doorway, like she was holding herself together with the frame.

""You're just tired,"" she said again, but slower this time. ""Let me take care of everything.""

The light behind her flickered.

The scent shifted again.

Rot blooming beneath the roses.

And I felt it—real and solid—someone holding my hand. The gentle pressure of skin against mine. A thumb brushing slow circles across my knuckles.

Warm. Familiar.

The mother in the doorway faltered.

Her smile fell off her face in pieces.

She took another step forward. Her heels sank into the darkened carpet beneath her. The pink roses had begun to bleed, their color weeping into the fibers like petals pressed too hard into damp paper.

Her hands lengthened.

Her arms, too.

Skin stretched like it had forgotten how to hold its shape.

""You can't leave,"" she said. Her voice was peeling now, layers of pitch unraveling into something brittle and hungry. ""You wanted this. You *called* me.""

A pulse beats through the walls. Not mine. Not hers.

The house was breathing.

Another sound surged from beyond the dream: a sharp snap, a metallic chirp, and a clipped and desperate voice shouting, swallowed before I could hear the words.

The mother screamed.

Not with volume.

With decay.

Her face sloughed off in strips, one eyelash-lined cheek peeling down her throat. Her teeth were long and yellow. Her perfume curdled in the air, collapsing into a stench like wet silk and spoiled milk.

""You don't get to leave!"" she shrieked.

She lunged.

And something yanked me.

Not by the arm. From deeper. From the ribs. From the spine. The world blurred, peeled, and shattered.

I surfaced like something pulled from deep water.

But not quickly.

I rose through layers.  
Darkness pressed thin over my eyes.  
Voices floated past me like feathers.  
Some sharp, some distant.  
None I could hold.

My body was a ghost beneath me.  
Heavy. Still. Waiting to be remembered.

Then light—bright, sterile, too white.  
It forced my eyes open in pieces.

There were sounds again.

Soft beeping. The slow hush of filtered air.  
A mechanical pulse that didn't belong in any dream.

My vision blurred—blinking hurt.

But then I felt it, a hand around mine.

Warm. Trembling. Real.

""Cassie…""The voice cracked like it had been broken for days.

My mother's face hovered above me.  
Eyes swollen with sleep and salt.  
Hair pulled back in haste.  
Her hand didn't stop moving, brushing hair from my forehead, squeezing my fingers like she was afraid I might drift again.

""You're awake,"" she whispered. Her breath hitched.  
""Oh god, Cassie—you're here.""

I wanted to speak, but my throat burned.  
My lips felt sewn shut with silence.

She leaned forward, pressing her forehead to the edge of the bed like a prayer folding in half.  
""I thought I lost you.""

Her voice broke open in the middle of the sentence.  
She didn't finish it.  
She didn't need to.

Tears slipped down her cheek and fell against my wrist.

I felt them.

And for a moment, I believed I was back.

Safe.

Home.

But then,

A flicker.  
Just past her shoulder.  
Just beyond the hum of the IV.  
In the far corner of the room where the light didn't quite reach—

Movement.

Small.  
Still.  
Watching.

It wasn't a shape, not entirely.  
Just the impression of one.  
The shadow left behind after a flash.  
Like the glow that lingers behind your eyes after you stare at the sun.

A little girl.

Head tilted.  
Hands at her sides.  
Patient.

I blinked.

Gone.

But the afterimage burned beneath my eyelids, vivid and pulsing like a warning.

And the silence in the room shifted.

Not louder.

Not darker.

Just… closer.

I turned toward the window, but all I saw was the pale wash of morning.  
Ordinary light.  
Safe light.  
But I didn't believe in that anymore.

A sob broke from somewhere I didn't recognize.

My mother looked up sharply, cupping my cheek with both hands.

""Cassie?"" she asked.  
But I couldn't answer.

I wept quietly, openly, like something had cracked wide inside me.

Not grief.  
Not relief.

Something else.

The sound of footsteps that had never touched the ground.  
The memory of fingers that never let go.

I had left the house.

But it hadn't let go of me.

1lqy10e,https://i.redd.it/jeszk52vjpaf1.jpeg,Non-Scale Victories!,"This is my first time posting but I’ve been enjoying all of your inspiring stories and encouraging advice. I have done IF in the past with some success but ultimately nothing super earth shattering. Just over a month ago I decided I’d had enough of feeling uncomfortable in my own skin (and clothes) and gave up alcohol cold turkey and started intermittent fasting again. I’ve tried to this several times over the past few years but with a husband who also drinks alcohol it’s proven to be quite the challenge to stay on the wagon. “Just one drink” always seems to lead to another, then another, and next thing you know you’re eating a whole bag of Doritos at 10:00 pm. Am I right? 😂🤦🏻‍♀️ 

Anyway, I’ve been adamant about absolutely NO alcohol for me for over a month (sparkling water is my friend!). I really don’t have a set schedule other than trying to listen to my body and also making sure I hit a deficit most days (this is where I went wrong in the past). I generally do 18:6-20:4 with a few random 40 hour fasts sprinkled in but I would like to work myself up to longer fasts, too. Sometimes I eat keto, sometimes I don’t, and every day I make sure to drink a few large classes of water with Celtic and Himalayan salts with lemon juice, in addition to my sparkling waters, black coffee, and occasional small glasses of raw Jersey milk. 

I tried weighing myself in the first couple of weeks but decided to stop because even though I was noticing changes, the scale was not. Now a month in, I’m noticing huge changes! My underwear are loose where previously I had major muffin top. Today I put on this dress which I haven’t even attempted to wear in 2 years, and it fits perfectly. So here’s to all the non-scale victories! Even if the scale says otherwise, if you feel better you ARE making progress! Keep going, YOU are worth it!",20,1751569657.0,intermittentfasting,6,0.92,False

Everyone just wants hookups and fun. I envy straight people—they can be themselves anywhere, anytime, and still find romantic love. But for us, it feels like we have to let ourselves be lusted after just to get a chance at connection. We have to let our bodies be used to find something deeper, as if love can only come after proving we’re desirable. It’s exhausting—constantly seeking validation and approval from a society (and even our own community) that judges us first by our looks.  

I know some people will say, “You don’t need others to validate you.” But let’s be real—this is a struggle so many gay people face. Our community sets harsh, unrealistic standards where better bodies get more attention, where lust comes before everything else.  

When will it be our turn to be loved first and lusted after second? When can we just sit in a coffee shop and meet someone without the pressure of performance or lust? When can we exist in the world—doing laundry, grabbing street food, doing groceries—and still feel seen for who we are, not just what we look like? When do we get a space where we don’t have to trade our bodies for affection, where we’re wanted for just who we are, and not on how we perform on bed?

CHAPTER 1            



  


Everything around me was drowsy this afternoon. Even the objects in my room had that air around them as if they were moving, but in a wavy slow way I kept staring at everything; my wardrobe, the decorations on my desk, the posters on my walls.

I put all the focus I had left that day into observing these moving, strange things, hoping that this time maybe I would finally fall asleep.

And there it was.

A poster I had hung there years ago, now so familiar that it became transparent but I looked at it, I focused more and I saw her; this woman at her brown antique vanity, she sat there, her long blonde hair floating behind her in soft waves like it was under the water. 

I tilted my head to look at it more directly.She was holding a tiny old mirror in her fairly gentle and skinny hands, as though she was holding a precious relic. She seemed to be the type of woman that gives meaning, beauty and character to everything she touches or holds. 

It all appeared very magical to me for a brief moment, as though I was with her in that bright room. With those wide windows, bringing the light of a bright blue sky into the room, highlighting her long white dress, along with her golden hair, and I shut my eyes to dive deeper into that atmosphere.

I believe I could almost smell the room for an instant around me, the fresh aromas of lilac and jasmine spreading.Making me feel alive again. 

And then I opened my eyes and suddenly got up slightly panicking; what I just experienced was just marvelous.

But again many things might strike one as amazing or out of the ordinary, when one is sleep deprived, I brush it off while slightly shaking my head blaming it again. Unconsciously. On my situation.

MY. DEAR. SITUATION.

   

In an attempt to forget about all this, I head to the kitchen and I instantly get hit by the cabbage smell from the fridge, it made me nauseous, I open my damn fridge. The smell hits harder. It’s a sack of old molding cabbage. I always ignored it sitting there;I decide to do something about it so I take it along with that hideous overwhelming smell to the bin and shut it close.

I reopen the fridge and all I want is something I could eat but I find nothing but that odor hitting my nostrils so badly that I flinch, and shut it close immediately, never planning on opening it anytime soon.

I stand there with a stomach so hollow; I feel like a hole is forming there. I press it with my palms, trying to muffle the pain. To hold it together. To not dig deeper.

A few moments pass, I look around and I get a slight satisfaction from everything being tidy and clean, It’s a decent kitchen. It makes me happy every time I look at it. 

 

It's the only place I always cherished, the wooden cabinets old but bit nostalgic, like they've been there for a long time and had many owners, but somehow I'm their favorite. The marble counters above them stand in the same way too; on them there is a set of knives I bought when I first came here, and a big mug of mine unwashed coffee dripping dry from its brim. My favorite part is the crocheted doilies here and there; it's the only place I put effort into, a broke effort is still considered an effort, I hope. 

I stare again, but this time not at anything, I'm thinking about what I have to do for the rest of the day, and I'm reminded again once more with the hunger eating me from the inside, I sigh, slip on my shoes, and leave.

Now taking the stairs down also as quick as I can,but I slow down when the back pain hits me, too. This fucker of a pain didn’t have to sneak up from behind—there’s already a hole forming in the front.

I learned to ignore that one as well; they said it's ordinary with a work like mine. I believe that, It's easier that way.

Looking around me now, the sun hitting my eyes and I try to adjust to the bright lighting; It's always odd to be out in these streets; I've lived here for years but somehow never got used to this town. It's hectic in an overwhelming way and sometimes it's dead as though it's deserted. 

I see buildings ahead, neither tall nor average.  This place is uncategorisable and incomprehensible; its colors are pale yellow, yet sometimes, while walking, a bright spot appears, and I always assume it belongs to a grandmother. That remained constrained and pressured most of her life, but she finally liberated herself from her chains. Then, she decided to make all the things she craved and longed for come true, one of them is to do something about these shabby complexes. 

I walk past those streets nothing interesting or catching, so I look down, and then up, to find myself at my destination; my workplace; a restaurant.

I head in, the place is always warm; everyone can feel it immediately.

I'm not sure about that, but I can tell it's the place friends and family come to escaping from the coldness and roughness of this town.

I always observe them; our customers or whenever I was free. I don’t have that luxury of watching people here, but in those occasional times when I can, I watch everything, without exception, my coworkers and their interactions, our customers and their behaviours. Not out of curiosity or nosiness, it might be in some cases, but this is not the case. It just gives me joy, pure delight to see how they seem different from what they are outside; they laugh in here, I know the irony behind that, but they laugh out loud as if they don't care if they are prestigious. Everyone is just comfortable. And I worked in enough places to know \_\_ seeing customers being truly at ease in public? That's something rare. Something remarkable.Only if they knew what happens in order for them to have that warm meal.

There she is, standing in front of me, looking at me closely,with curiosity as always and I snap out of it, and she smiles at me, her smile is the sort that just make me want to hug her, but I can't hug her again I just did that this morning, although I wouldn't mind to do it once more, or all the time. But she doesn't know this.          

    	 ""Go to our place hurry, I prepared something for us"",                   

She says to me quickly as she wipes the back of her hands in her apron on her thighs and hurries to the kitchen. It's a movement she does all the time, like to prepare for her next move or mission; working here gives everyone weird habits, it seems.         

She knows that I'm here for lunch, perhaps dinner, it's the same for me. What matters is to eat something. It was on her today since I finished my shift while everyone was still here. When she leaves early, I take care of it too. We got ourselves covered, but it's always better when she handles the cooking.

I got bored and tired of my own meals; I reckon it has something to do with me cooking for people the whole time. Mine just started to feel predictable,boring and tasteless. 

I wait for her in the back of the restaurant, in a little hideout we made for ourselves, one dusty red couch, three small cushions we brought from our homes and two old chairs that we stick together to form a table. I'm sat on the couch, grey greasy walls surrounding me; I lay back tracing lazy patterns on the cushion. And then she finally shows up, a large platter on her hands and she slowly puts it on the table—well, on the chairs more accurately. A wide smile is on my face as I see four bowls full of noodles and soup. I look up to her and I gesture for her to sit and tell her: ""You're spoiling me way too much.""

she positions herself on the couch while saying: 

""Don't get used to it then, I don’t want you to be a pain in my ass""

The first sip of the soup feels so comforting, as though all the pain I had disappeared. I assume it's made with the noodle's broth and some leftover shrimp somewhere, but she has the power to turn into something flavourful and soothing. I close my eyes in satisfaction as I say to her :   

“Louise… you just hugged me.”      

She chuckles.

“I’ll show you how \_real\_ hugging works. You’ll regret saying that.”             “You can’t do shit.”    

“Okay. You wanted this. I warned you.”       

And that’s it. She jumps over me, hugging me tight—then even tighter. I struggle to pull her away, but she’s way stronger, and pulls me closer instead.         



  “Louise, for God’s sake, you’ll kill me!” I laugh, breathless.      



   ""Come on Zelda, man up! YOU wanted a hug.""     

I try to get up, and then flip her over, and that's it; we start to giggle and to Laugh incontrollably, and laughter fills the street that was already getting dark, only a dim yellow light across the street lit us. After that, we grew tired and drained, we just laid down there simply, stared above us at the deep dark sky, and the weather was still around us, almost chill; it smelled of noodles and shrimp still; it filled the air.

The thought of a coffee machine that consistently delivers barista-style drinks is comforting, but like me, anyone who owns a Keurig knows that its brilliance fades without proper upkeep. The **Quick & Clean B0997HLPHW Quick & Clean Keurig Cleaning Pods** is the product I tested to overcome this very challenge. And boy, did it take me on a journey—both good and eye-opening.

**Design and Compatibility: Streamlined for Ease**

One of the first things that struck me was how compact and well-packaged this product is. It's a 12-pack of cleaning pods that fit snugly into any Keurig brewer—versatile enough for models 1.0 and 2.0. The absence of any overpowering scent made it feel non-toxic and environmentally friendly, just as it’s advertised. Simple “pop-in-pop-out” functionality ensured even my coffee-drinking neophyte friends could safely handle it. As someone typically juggling half a dozen tasks every morning, quick usability wins a huge point in my book.

[Check Quick & Clean B0997HLPHW price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0997hlphw/)

**Performance: A Noticeable Coffee Uplift**

After brewing my first cleaning pod through the Keurig, the difference was undeniable. Longstanding residue and that “old coffee aftertaste” seemingly vanished—like magic. My coffee tasted fresh, vibrant, and back to the standard I enjoyed when the brewer was brand new. What’s better, I noticed smoother operation in the machine. Rarely do cleaning products exceed my expectations, but this one truly did some heavy lifting.

**Perks**

- **Restores Flavor**: The proprietary formula ensures that old coffee grinds and residues are eliminated with ease. It’s like your coffee machine got a breath of fresh air.  
- **Extends Machine Lifespan**: By targeting specific areas prone to residue buildup—like the pack holder, funnel, and exit needle—the pod combats long-term damage.  
- **Eco-Friendly**: As someone cautious about toxins, knowing that this is biodegradable and non-toxic was seriously reassuring.

**Hiccups During Use**

A cleaning product might sound too good to be true, and while it performs admirably overall, there are minor aspects that I’d flag.

- Keurig owners who expect miracles might need to reinforce cleaning with additional descaling solutions (not included).  
- While the initial cleaning run removes significant buildup, some heavily-used machines might require a follow-up session.

**Downsides**

- **Dependency on Regular Cleaning**: Consistent use is mandatory; this isn’t a “one-and-done” type solution.  
- **Not a Fix-All**: It's brilliant for cleaning but doesn’t replace the need for other maintenance like descaling.  
- **Price Market Caveat**: Although it delivers excellent value, frugal users might hesitate compared to homemade remedies.

**Alternative Offerings**

Cleaners from Affresh and Urnex often pop up when discussing Keurig-compatible maintenances. Though both competitors stand tall regarding brand name recognition, I found **Quick & Clean’s cleaning pods** more cost-efficient for ongoing use. The simplicity of just popping a capsule into the brewer outweighs the elbow grease often needed with DIY liquid cleaning options. However, I believe Urnex’s liquid cleaners might edge out **Quick & Clean** in cases where extreme residue buildup becomes problematic.

**Smart Spending**

When tallying up cost-effectiveness, this product undeniably offers an upper hand against disposable alternatives like soap-based scrubs or non-specific cleaners. Even using it daily results in three months of uninterrupted cleaning, which ensures you’re getting the utility and quality worth paying for. It fills a niche for users like me—those who value convenience coupled with reliability.

I was living with an active, raging alcoholic and another person who was doing meth. It was an awful situation. So I found a sober living house (with the help of some great people from where I did rehab)  and stayed there for about 7 months while I worked on myself. I was able to repair my finances, get into the recovery community, really become active and establish healthy habits.

At my home group for AA meetings, I became a central figure there. I'm active at meetings, I open, I chair, I make coffee, I manage our library, I work our districts AA hotline and more. I try to do what I can - especially for new people. I went all in. Lately, a new guy came in and his story shared a lot of similarities with my own. He was staying at a seedy motel paying an egregious amount of money. Alcohol is his main issue but as you could imagine; other stuff goes on at the motel. At a recent meeting, he expressed sorrow about this situation because he really wants a chance to actually get sober.  He had lost so much as a result of his problem.

I felt like I had to do something. I have an excellent rapport with the director of the sober house I stayed at so I got them in touch. He would be paying half of what he's paying now so he could actually have a chance to save money.  They both determined it would be a good fit but they require medical treatment and detox before he could go in. I felt compelled to see this through and help this guy. I spent days trying to find a place for him to go. No insurance. And many of these treatment facilities are only open to residents that reside within the same county. But after some grit, I found one for him and he's going in today! He'll be able to get into the house after and start a new chapter.

It just feels so damn good to help someone who really needed it.

I have so many connections in the community now and I was able to leverage many of them for information that ended up directly helping him. A year ago, I was him. So I'm glad in just this short time, I was able to really be of service to someone who is in a dire situation. I like doing this and I hope to continue to keep being of service to others and help them enter a new chapter in their lives.",2,1751569241.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

1lqxueo,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW_PH/comments/1lqxueo/this_wlw_shit_is_hard_man/,"this wlw shit is hard, man 😮‍💨","Hi. So, I’m a 21-year-old lesbian, and honestly? Gusto ko na talagang magka-girlfriend.

I want to experience dating—yung simple lang. I wanna take someone out, give small gifts, mag-send ng “good morning” and “good night” texts, have someone to update about my day, get coffee with, be silly with, and just… build something real.

I’ve been single for almost two years now. Along the way, may mga crushes ako here and there. Yung first crush ko after my last relationship—grabe, sobrang torpe ko. As in, dinrawing ko pa siya sa sketchpad. Nag-chat ako eventually, pero sobrang awkward ko. And then I didn’t pursue it anymore kasi in my head, lagi kong feeling na out of my league sila. Like, unattainable. Parang hindi talaga ako enough.

Yung second crush ko, friend ko siya. Classmate and groupmate ko sa acads. I actually confessed, and we’re still friends now—okay naman. Pero during that time, may iba siyang in-entertain, so obviously it didn’t go anywhere.

After that, it’s just been a series of failed talking stages. Either ako yung umaayaw kasi hindi kami nagki-click, hindi ka-wavelength, walang genuine connection, or sila yung umaalis. Minsan sinasabi nila na they’re just looking for something casual, which is okay naman. I respect that. Kanya-kanyang trip. Pero at the end of the day, I’m left with this sinking feeling na I’m being left behind.

Parang, nakaka-insecure. Nakaka-undesirable. All my lesbian friends have girlfriends. They seem so happy, ang ayos ng mga relationships nila. Parang every queer person I know has some sort of love life. Ako lang yung hindi. Sa circle namin of 7 or 8, ako na lang yung single. And it’s not like gusto ko lang magka-jowa for the sake of it. Gusto ko yung real connection. Kaya kahit may nakakausap ako minsan, if it’s not there, I end it. I don’t wanna force something fake.

But it’s just been so hard to find someone I vibe with. Someone with the same energy, the same… level. I get it, hobbies and interests help you meet people—ganoon ko rin naman na-meet yung ex ko. But right now, I don’t really have the time or mental energy to pour into those hobbies kasi I’m also reviewing for the board exams.

And honestly? Parang dumadagdag pa yung insecurity ko sa katawan ko. I’m a masc lesbian—not the conventional one, though. Hindi ako wolf-cut na matangkad and payat. I have hypothyroidism, so my hormones affect my weight and it’s really hard to lose. I feel like people don’t find me attractive. I feel invisible. And lost. And unlovable, sometimes.

I know love isn’t everything, and I do have goals. Pero minsan, nakakaramdam ka rin talaga ng lungkot, especially when you feel like everyone else has what you’re still hoping for. So… um.. any tips? Advice?

Baby Pookie babbles something incomprehensible and slumps onto the first pew. He curls up sideways, heart thudding, eyes fluttering. His fingers twitch. He hugs his stuffy closer.

Priest stepping closer, voice lowering dramatically: “…I have seen this before. Unnatural stillness. Unfocused eyes.”

He crosses his arms. His voice is actor loud: “The Devil confuses the innocent! This poor young man is POSSESSED!”

He starts praying. He pulls out a crucifix and a bottle of holy water.

Priest: “Evil, leave this child! Demon, I command you in the name of—”

The chapel doors SLAM open.

Enter TOM THE PIONEER. Denim jacket. Lightning bolt cane. Eyes full of fire and experience. He moves with intent, with rage that’s been earned. Like Moses coming down from the mountain and finding the golden calf.

Tom, voice booming with power: “That boy’s not possessed. He’s recovering from a seizure. Put down the water, Father. And start listening.”

The Priest freezes. Tom walks down the aisle, slow but steady, and kneels beside Baby Pookie. He takes his hand, smooths his hair.

Tom: “It’s alright, Sunshine. You’re safe. Just ride it out. I’ve got you.”

Pookie mumbles, eyes fluttering open: “Tom…? I saw pudding in the sky…”

Tom, grinning: “That’s the post-ictal brain. Everything’s weird. Rest easy.”

Priest, stunned: “Seizure? But… he was shaking. Speaking in tongues—”

Tom, voice calm and unshakable: “He was scared. And confused. Not possessed. You mistook biology for blasphemy. That’s not faith. That’s fear.”

He walks slowly toward the altar. Stands eye to eye with the Priest.

Tom: “Faith should be a safe place. Not a place that shames people for what their bodies can’t control.”

Priest, stammering and embarrassed: “I—I only wanted to help…”

Tom: “Then help by learning. Start here—”

He pulls a folded pamphlet from his jacket pocket and hands it over.

“Seizures and the Spirit: A Guide for Faith Leaders” – by Tom the Pioneer

Tom: “Religion is for healing the spirit. This kid’s spirit? It is stronger than you’ll ever know. What needs help right now is his body. And that’s not your job. That’s community. That’s care. That’s us. As your sign says, ‘Open Heart.’”

The chapel is silent.

The Priest bows his head. His voice contrite: “…I didn’t know.”

Tom: “Now you do.”

Outside –

Pookie is back in adult form but still confused. He is still hugging his stuffy: “Are we going to church now?”

Tom: “No, Sunshine. We’re going home. Where grace doesn’t come with guilt.”

(If you invoke the names of gods, don’t be surprised if a messenger shows up.)

10-How I like to dress when Character customs come-I always always wear a dark or orange ball or trucker cap with a small log. I love pink, yellow, and orange pastel hawaiian shirts. In the fall, I wear soft colored flannels. I like simple string hoodies. I like cargo shorts and carpenter pants. I like vans and Air Jordan sneakers. 

9-Coffee Machine! I work as a barista. You need a Coffee Grinder, a puq press, a steam wand (usually built in but separate for moonstone), an espresso machine, and the milk/sweeteners/cups+lids. It would be a fun time management minigame to make coffee for Paolo or yourself. And I would love to see colorful sunrise and this special coffee could let you want up early enough to see sunrise. 

8-Keystone-A small item that let's you type a name for your island that appears on the menu map and on screen when you land on it.

7-New Decorations I'm good at pixel art hmu devs-Tropical (Tiki, Cocktail Bar, Sand Castle, Seashells, animated swimming fish silhouette for water, water spout, Volleyball Net, Brain Coral, Dendritic Coral, Animated Sea Weed, Bubbles, and multiple pastel tropical shirts and shorts when character custom comes out) Far East (Red Japanese Castle house with Hachi on the roof, Liondog type statue, Pagoda, Tori, Sandles, Hand Washing Station, Bonsai Tree, Samurai Armor, Nekomata, Vending Machine, Sushi/Ramen Bar) Urban (Multiple Arcade Machines for Zed, Stoplight, Car, Bike Rack, Telephone pole, Soda Machine, Payphone booth, Bustop wall and bench) Fire Islands (House of carved stone that goes on fire island walls, rakshasa painting, ancient jade stele, giant clay pots, extra extra big chandelier, big silver ball, burning man type wire and mesh sculptures) Holy Pack, (Rose Window Rococo house, Dome with Minarets house, Church Pews, Pulpit, Gold Alcove framing, Prayer Mat, Wall Rainbow Circle)

6-Lighting Decorations-String lights, pastel string lights, rainbow string lights, Chandelier, Extra big Chandelier, spiral dangling lights, oil street lamp, Unidirectional Spotlight, ancient lamp, stone garden lamps

5-A late late game second warp whistle that teleports to the totem and the first always goes to Moonstone Island. 

4-Some of the things in overworld to be player obtainable. A smaller version of the temple guardians with their same effect. I was bummed I couldn't tame them. I also love the little shrines on the temple islands. 

3-More Tree Variety. I would pitch two types of tree per island. They all still just provide wood, but Cherry, Willow, Birch, Redwood, and Pine trees feel like decorative omissions. That said, Still put a MS spin on them and have the right vibes for the islands. 

2-Better clouds. I fly a lot. It is one of my favorite things to do in the game, but the two cloud tiles just look very low quality compared to how well clouds can be made. As a pixel artist, you can take pictures of real clouds, size them down to pixelate, then size them up and clean. We could easily take a dozen clouds of high variety. 

1-Be able to craft if your inventory is full if the item uses the last of the ingredient in inventory. Inventory management is unavoidable, but fiddling this much hurts.

By Avery Quinn","# Chapter 1 - The Nightmare Behind the Salvation

In order to marry his white moonlight, my fiancé publicly exposed my father’s undercover identity, leading to him being captured and tortured for a day and a night.

In the end, my father’s legs were severed, his eyes gouged out, and he was thrown into a metal cage to be burned alive.

As I was on the verge of madness, ready to seek revenge on my fiancé, my childhood friend, who had become the head of a powerful mafia family, returned from abroad with a large entourage.

He used his family’s influence to hire the best legal team for my father and promised to clear his name.

I trusted him.

After the funeral, I called off the previous engagement.

I married the man who had been my rock in my darkest hour.

Five years later, outside a private room, I overheard a conversation between my ex-fiancé and him.

“Every time Wynter sees me, she looks like she wants to tear me apart.”

“But, do you think that foolish woman would go insane if she found out that the one who betrayed her father was actually the husband who held her every night?”

My hand froze on the door as I was about to push it open.

My ex-fiancé’s mocking voice continued:

“You’re really ruthless, Julien!”

“Wynter treated you like a brother when you were kids, and now she sleeps with you every night! But she would never dream that it was you who uncovered her father’s true identity!”

==============================

My hand remained frozen on the door as Jude’s voice carried a hint of insinuation.

“Do you think that silly woman, Wynter, who massages your shoulders and legs every day, would skin you alive if she found out that it was you who leaked her father’s undercover identity to the mob boss?”

“Shut up.”

Julien’s voice was cold and warning.

“Tsk, the head of the mafia, pretending to be a saint now?”

“Her father was the uncle you called since childhood, yet you pushed him to his death just to please Margot.”

A bottle slammed heavily on the table, and Julien gritted his teeth:

“I owe Wynter and Uncle Lawrence more than I can ever repay! Everything I did back then was for Margot’s safety! If you dare touch a single hair on her head, I’ll make you wish you were dead!”

“How deeply sentimental the mafia boss is,”

Jude sneered.

“You’re truly devoted to Margot, but unfortunately, she doesn’t want a devil with blood on his hands!”

“You’d better hold on to your Wynter. She thinks you’re her salvation, but little does she know you’re her nightmare!”

The sound of a glass shattering was deafening.

I forced myself to stop trembling and hurried to the rooftop bar.

I downed a shot of strong liquor, and the burning sensation brought tears to my eyes, though I rarely drank.

The conversation I had just overheard echoed in my mind.

It turned out that the one who had betrayed my father wasn’t Jude, but Julien, the man who had promised to clear his name.

The body that had been mutilated beyond recognition was his doing.

No wonder Julien, usually so composed, had stared in silence at my father’s charred remains in the morgue.

And I had naively thought it was grief and anger.

Little did I know that the man I had shared a bed with for five years was the real executioner who had killed my father!

All the tenderness he had carefully woven over the years was nothing but a charade of atonement!

How laughable.

Hatred churned in my chest.

Just as my hand touched the glass, Julien suddenly wrapped his arms around me from behind, burying his drunken face in my shoulder:

“Wynter, where have you been… I’ve missed you… Let’s go home, okay?”

Over the years, every time he got drunk, he would hold me like this, repeating over and over how much he loved me.

His men always said that the respected mafia boss never lied, that he truly loved me.

But now, it all made me sick.

I expressionlessly helped him into the armored car.

Julien lay his head on my lap, his furrowed brow finally relaxing, looking like a harmless child.

“Margot… why… why can’t it be me…”

At last, I understood the name he had murmured in countless drunken nights.

Margot, the woman who had taken everything from me, was his white moonlight.

It turned out Julien had never forgotten her, and he had even put on an act with me for her sake.

I had been too naive, underestimating his obsession with Margot.

# Chapter 2 - The Heart That Belonged to Margot

The satellite phone with the golden lion emblem slipped from the inner pocket of his tailored suit. As I bent down to pick it up, an encrypted message flashed on the screen.

""Godfather, thank you for stepping in tonight and resolving the dispute between the three families! But the piece of Italian territory you promised, Margot cannot accept it. It’s far too valuable!""

Then came Margot’s private update: ""Only a true queen can be crowned.""

The accompanying photo was of an ancient ring adorned with a ruby, said to be the heirloom of Italy’s oldest underground family, symbolizing supreme power.

I knew Margot had deliberately let me see this.

This week, Julien had been severely injured in a family shootout, a bullet piercing his chest.

Yet, as soon as he could stand, he flew overseas. I was both heartbroken and furious, thinking he was risking his life for the family’s honor.

Turns out, he went to attend the family’s succession ceremony.

Even with a gunshot wound, he fought for that ring, the symbol of ultimate power, to present it to his Margot.

Almost involuntarily, I entered his private password.

As the last digit was entered, the screen lit up.

It was Margot’s birthday.

Julien never let me touch his private phone, saying it was the Godfather’s rule.

Once unlocked, Margot’s smiling face in an extravagant gown filled the screen.

No wonder his eyes always softened when he turned it on.

Opening the folders, I found albums all named after her.

【Margot·Opera House】

【Margot·Vineyard】

【Margot·Coronation】

Hundreds of photos, all of Margot at various family banquets.

Not a single photo of me, not even one of himself.

Only Margot.

Just like his heart, which had always belonged to her.

As the car entered the mansion, I felt a chill looking at the empty basement.

It used to display my father’s badges and all the evidence from his undercover days, proof of his twenty years infiltrating the underground families.

Every time I saw them, it felt like he was still on that unfinished mission.

But one morning, all that evidence, enough to bring down the underground families, had vanished. The police said it had been anonymously destroyed.

Julien held me for three days as I broke down.

Now I understood. It was him who destroyed the last remnants of my father’s legacy.

Another encrypted message popped up:

""Godfather, as per your request, the will has been drafted. All your Italian underground assets and the throne’s inheritance will be transferred to Miss Margot.""

""Awaiting your final confirmation and signature.""

Through blurred tears, I saw that day again.

At my father’s funeral, he stood solemnly in his mourning suit, swearing to me:

""Wynter, I swear on the honor of the Godfather, I will give you a home. Everything I have is yours.""

I laid Julien on the bed, but unlike usual, I didn’t take off his shoes and socks.

I went straight to the guest room.

As I closed my eyes, all I could think of were the moments he had doted on me over the years.

# Chapter 3 - The Weight of Betrayal

The morning light filtered through the glass, warming my face as I opened my eyes to meet Julien's intense gaze.

He leaned down and pressed a kiss to my forehead.

""Wynter, were you upset last night? I'm sorry, I had too much to drink at the family meeting. I promise it won't happen again.""

His voice was as gentle as ever.

I responded with a faint acknowledgment and retreated to the bathroom to wash away his scent.

The dining table was laden with an elaborate French breakfast, the kind that would have moved me deeply in the past.

But after seeing his phone.

I couldn't muster a smile.

Every dish on the table was Margot's favorite.

The doorbell rang, and Margot walked in, dressed in the latest high-fashion gown.

She sat down at the table naturally, smiling at me.

""Sorry to intrude, Wynter. Julien and I have some business to attend to this morning, and he asked me to join for breakfast.""

I stared at the access card in her hand, identical to mine, and remained silent.

Julien sensed the tension and leaned in to explain softly.

""Margot is one of our most trusted people. It's normal for her to have access to the estate...""

Before he could finish, he suddenly stood up in a panic, snatching the hot coffee from Margot's side.

""Your blood pressure is low; you can't have espresso. After all these years, you still don't take care of yourself.""

Margot smiled faintly.

""Yes, I’m lucky you always remember.""

The moment their eyes met, the air around us seemed to freeze.

I stood up to leave, but Margot called out to me.

""Wynter, we need professional documentation for today's body restoration. Can you come and take the photos?""

""I don't trust the new forensic examiner.""

Since my father's tragic death, I hadn't touched a camera.

Looking through the viewfinder would always remind me of how he taught me to capture evidence.

Of his resentment during his torture.

I could never press the shutter again.

Julien knew this well.

He had locked away all my photography equipment, saying I could start again when I was ready.

But now, without hesitation, he pushed me into the back seat of the armored car.

""Wynter, you know Margot gets car sick easily. I’m sorry, but you’ll have to sit in the back.""

He forgot that my motion sickness, developed after numerous escapes, was far worse than Margot's.

The bumpy ride made me nauseous the entire way.

When we arrived at the morgue, Julien carefully checked Margot's protective gear and personally escorted her into the restoration area.

I leaned against the car door, gasping for air, trying to steady my dizziness.

""Wynter, the restoration is about to start. Don’t be difficult. This documentation is crucial for Margot and the family.""

Julien forcibly pulled me inside, and I nearly dropped my equipment as I lost my balance.

For the first time in five years, I held a camera again. Fear overwhelmed me, and my fingers trembled uncontrollably.

I forced myself to stay calm, meticulously documenting the restoration process.

During the mid-session break, only Margot and I remained.

She glanced at my photos with disdain, a cold smile curling her lips.

""Wynter, you’re just as useless as your father. You couldn’t even keep your undercover identity hidden before infiltrating the mafia!""

""A field mouse like you doesn’t deserve the Sicilian godfather.""

I gripped the camera tightly, my knuckles turning white, trying to suppress the rage bubbling inside.

Suddenly, my cheek burned with a sharp sting.

Margot withdrew her hand, her eyes filled with contempt.

""How dare you cling to the title of the lady of the house? I never thought you’d latch onto Julien so quickly after Jude dumped you!""

""You’re not worthy of him. Whether it’s Jude or Julien, they’ll always be mine!""

""You’ll never be enough!""

My face still tingled, but before I could react.

Margot suddenly grabbed my hand, using the momentum to throw herself to the ground.

She curled up on the floor, instantly transforming into a pitiful figure.

""Wynter, I didn’t mean to criticize your photos. I just wanted to suggest a different angle... Never mind...""

Julien burst through the door, a water bottle crashing to the floor.

He rushed over, shoving me aside, and quickly checked Margot’s condition.

""Julien, I’m fine. Don’t blame Wynter. I lost my balance...""

""Margot, you’re too kind. Don’t cover for her. I saw everything!""

Julien carefully helped Margot up, treating her like a wounded soldier on the battlefield.

He shielded her in his arms, his gaze icy as it turned to me.

It was the first time in our five years of marriage that he had looked at me this way.

""Wynter, apologize to Margot! I’ve been too lenient with you, letting you harm a comrade!""

""Do you know the injury on her face could affect her mission?""

Julien’s furious eyes bore into me, yet he ignored the handprint on my cheek.

I met his gaze calmly.

""It’s Margot who should apologize. She insulted my father!""

""Julien, aren’t you going to explain what happened to my father?""

A flicker of panic crossed his eyes.

""That’s all in the past. Why are you bringing it up now?""

""I promised him I’d protect you, but only if you don’t harm Margot.""

I let out a cold laugh, finally seeing his true colors.

A wave of dizziness hit me, and I fell backward.

I really like the company and the work, and I had hoped to stay longer but I’m struggling with how toxic some of the women on my team are.

Most of them are in their 30s–40s. Even though I’ve been polite and friendly, they gossip about me, huddle together whispering, and have even been stalking my social media. On my second day, I overheard one of them say I have “daddy issues” after I talked briefly about my culture and my dad on a call. That was the first red flag.

I tweeted something general that day: “Why do women in their 30s/40s belittle younger women? What do you gain from that?” And apparently they found it. Today, I overheard them looking at my Twitter and mentioning the fact I deleted it. They kept laughing and looking at me, I even overheard someone calling me “weird.”

It’s gotten so uncomfortable. I’ve tried to join their conversations, but they shut me out. A few even bailed on lunch when I said I’d come. I’ve been asked to schedule coffee chats with team members, and I heard them questioning why I was doing that. Also, they keep making passive comments about my age, “youth on your side” and so on.

I’m trying hard not to take it personally, but it’s been disheartening. I really wanted to connect with the team but I don’t know if I can see myself working with them long-term.

His voice was as gentle as ever, but I felt nothing. I responded with a faint acknowledgment and retreated to the bathroom to wash away his scent.

The dining table was laden with an elaborate French breakfast, the kind that would have moved me deeply in the past.

But after seeing his phone.

I couldn't muster a smile.

Every dish on the table was Margot's favorite.

The doorbell rang, and Margot walked in, dressed in the latest high-fashion gown. She sat down at the table naturally, smiling at me.

""Sorry to intrude, Luna Wynter. Alpha Julien and I have some pack business to attend to this morning, and he asked me to join for breakfast.""

I stared at the access card in her hand, identical to mine, and remained silent.

Julien sensed the tension and leaned in to explain softly.

""Margot is one of our most trusted pack members. It's normal for her to have access to the estate...""

Before he could finish, he suddenly stood up in a panic, snatching the hot coffee from Margot's side.

""Your blood pressure is low; you can't have espresso. After all these years, you still don't take care of yourself.""

Margot smiled faintly.

""Yes, I’m lucky you always remember.""

The moment their eyes met, the air around us seemed to freeze.

I stood up to leave, but Margot called out to me.

""Luna Wynter, we need professional documentation for today's pack restoration. Can you come and take the photos?""

""I don't trust the new pack photographer.""

Since my father's tragic death, I hadn't touched a camera.

Looking through the viewfinder would always remind me of how he taught me to capture evidence.

Of his resentment during his torture.

I could never press the shutter again.

Julien knew this well.

He had locked away all my photography equipment, saying I could start again when I was ready.

But now, without hesitation, he pushed me into the back seat of the pack's armored vehicle.

""Wynter, you know Margot gets car sick easily. I’m sorry, but you’ll have to sit in the back.""

He forgot that my motion sickness, developed after numerous pack missions, was far worse than Margot's.

The bumpy ride made me nauseous the entire way.

When we arrived at the pack's medical facility, Julien carefully checked Margot's protective gear and personally escorted her into the restoration area.

I leaned against the car door, gasping for air, trying to steady my dizziness.

""Wynter, the restoration is about to start. Don’t be difficult. This documentation is crucial for Margot and the pack.""

Julien forcibly pulled me inside, and I nearly dropped my equipment as I lost my balance.

For the first time in five years, I held a camera again. Fear overwhelmed me, and my fingers trembled uncontrollably.

I forced myself to stay calm, meticulously documenting the restoration process.

During the mid-session break, only Margot and I remained.

She glanced at my photos with disdain, a cold smile curling her lips.

""Luna Wynter, you’re just as useless as your father. You couldn’t even keep your undercover identity hidden before infiltrating the rogue packs!""

""A field mouse like you doesn’t deserve the Alpha of the pack.""

I gripped the camera tightly, my knuckles turning white, trying to suppress the rage bubbling inside.

Suddenly, my cheek burned with a sharp sting.

Margot withdrew her hand, her eyes filled with contempt.

""How dare you cling to the title of Luna? I never thought you’d latch onto Alpha Julien so quickly after Beta Jude dumped you!""

""You’re not worthy of him. Whether it’s Jude or Julien, they’ll always be mine!""

""You’ll never be enough!""

My face still tingled, but before I could react.

Margot suddenly grabbed my hand, using the momentum to throw herself to the ground.

She curled up on the floor, instantly transforming into a pitiful figure.

""Luna Wynter, I didn’t mean to criticize your photos. I just wanted to suggest a different angle... Never mind...""

Julien burst through the door, a water bottle crashing to the floor.

He rushed over, shoving me aside, and quickly checked Margot’s condition.

""Margot, I’m fine. Don’t blame Luna Wynter. I lost my balance...""

""Margot, you’re too kind. Don’t cover for her. I saw everything!""

Julien carefully helped Margot up, treating her like a wounded soldier on the battlefield.

He shielded her in his arms, his gaze icy as it turned to me.

It was the first time in our five years of mating that he had looked at me this way.

""Wynter, apologize to Margot! I’ve been too lenient with you, letting you harm a pack member!""

""Do you know the injury on her face could affect her pack duties?""

Julien’s furious eyes bore into me, yet he ignored the handprint on my cheek.

I met his gaze calmly.

""It’s Margot who should apologize. She insulted my father!""

""Julien, aren’t you going to explain what happened to my father?""

A flicker of panic crossed his eyes.

""That’s all in the past. Why are you bringing it up now?""

""I promised him I’d protect you, but only if you don’t harm Margot.""

I let out a cold laugh, finally seeing his true colors.

A wave of dizziness hit me, and I fell backward.

We are torn between Canterbury and Folkestone. We would like to do something locally, but also visit London once or twice.

I got started with an AI scientific translation tool, and along the way learned a whole bunch of stuff. I trialled out quite a few iterations of ""it"" before eventually realising that what I had would better suited for helping devs launch AI agents incredibly quickly. I then dropped the whole initial product and focused on that. Now, feasibly, there's a working product ready to go and I'm just coming up for air. It's just me, reddit, and maybe a small marketing budget to get devs signing up and trialling it out.

[gather.is](http://gather.is) is an encrypted messaging app, like signal or telegram, where launching an AI agent from your local codebase is quicker than making a coffee. You sign up, get an API key for your agent, run `uv pip install gathersdk` then scaffold the project with `gather init` and at that stage you have all the code you need to launch your agent onto the internet. The SDK creates you an agent.py file powered by PydanticAI but it could be very easily replaced by any other agent framework. You're ready to launch. You just need to copy your API key to .env.example, rename it to .env, and you can now get your agent online by running `python agent.py.` By being 'online' I mean just that, the AI agent is now in an online group chat which the dev can invite people into for testing. 

I have a few videos about the project,[ this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR4Ubh4cKo8) is more 'product' focused for a more casual/user perspective, and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B50ZK6uT468&feature=youtu.be) goes into a little more detail about the developer experience. 7

A couple of things stand out to me. First, it means devs keep their code. None of it has to leave their local dev machine at all, so that's a plus. It also means the dev environment \*is\* the production environment, which makes things nice and zippy. Also, I recently added 'widgets' with a view that maybe this is the SaaS part, in that devs get an embed code for the chat, which has user sessions. Basically, they can dev the agent locally, have a 'real' internet access point for it, *and* they can then embed the agent into any client website with a simple iframe/YouTube like code.

The project is currently just...me.",0,1751568738.0,ycombinator,2,0.5,False

We hung out recently, went thrifting, got coffee—super normal, fun, chill vibes.

Fast forward to last night: we had the same shift and decided to hang out again after work. I followed her back to her place and everything seemed fine at first. I met her roommate (also 19F) and the roommate’s boyfriend. All cool.

We smoked a little pre-roll she had and were just chilling, watching her roommate play Fortnite and talking. But then things started getting weird.

Mandy started making borderline sexual/inappropriate comments toward me—out of nowhere. For context, I’m a lesbian (she knows that), but I’ve never once shown interest in her romantically or sexually, so it made me super uncomfortable.

At one point, her roommate asked if I was spending the night, and I said no, because I had something to do in the morning. Mandy immediately chimed in with, “Nah, she’s just hitting and quitting. She’s just hittin’ and dipping.” Like?? What?

Then she offered us ice cream—her roommate said yes, I said no. Mandy kept insisting, and her roommate jokingly said something like, “Girl, you’re getting something,” in a playful, like she’s not letting you leave without a treat kinda way. But Mandy took it way too far and said, “Oh, she’s getting something for sure, and I’m NOT talking about ice cream.” “She tryna fuckkk”, “we finna bang” etc 

Her roommate and I just looked at each other like wtf… No one laughed. It was awkward. She made a few more weird comments like that—nobody reacted, and even Mandy herself was like “That’s weird” after saying one of them.

It made me feel super uncomfortable and honestly kind of gross. I haven’t shown any interest in her like that, and the whole vibe shifted in a way that made me feel put on the spot. I think what freaked me out most was it was so abrupt, and the fact that she just continued to make comments like the ones stated above even AFTER the roommate and I showed distaste. But yeah anyway, Now I’m like… am I overreacting for not wanting to go over there again/ hang out with her again.

If you’re going to start aligning your magic with the days of the week, Monday is the perfect entry point. Ruled by the Moon, this day carries emotional depth, psychic clarity, and intuitive power. It’s moody, mystical, and ideal for setting the tone for your entire week. The goal? A quick, potent Monday ritual you can do in 20 minutes or less—because not everyone has time for a full ceremony before coffee.

Your Monday magic begins the moment you wake. Because Sunday’s dream energy lingers, you should grab your journal before anything else. Don’t overthink it—just jot down dream fragments, symbols, or emotional impressions. Even “goat in the kitchen” might mean something later. This is shadow work lite, and yes, it counts as self-care.

Next, make your morning tea a ritual. Chamomile is a solid base, but adding a pinch of mugwort deepens your intuitive flow. Stir clockwise and whisper your intention as you infuse it with magic. As you sip, focus on what you’re healing or what insights you want to receive. It’s grounding, it’s magical, and it’s still caffeinated.

[Read the full article to craft your 20-minute Monday morning rituals](https://thealtpath.net/monday-magic-spells/)*.*

Then, grab your tarot deck. A simple three-card spread sets the emotional tone for the week. Card 1: “What do I need to feel?” Card 2: “What’s hidden?” Card 3: “What can I release?” Lay down a moonstone or labradorite for an extra intuitive boost. This five-minute pull brings clarity without eating up your whole morning.

Light a white candle and speak a quick prayer to Hecate, or any moon-aligned goddess of your choice. Keep it short but meaningful. “Guide my emotions, open my intuition, protect my path.” Say it with heart, then pause to listen. The moon doesn’t shout—she whispers.

To reinforce your emotional boundaries, do a quick energy cleansing. Hold a bit of Florida Water or saltwater between your palms. Rub your hands together clockwise, then pull white light down through your crown and into the earth. Visualize it sweeping away any emotional funk. Anoint your forehead, base of skull, and wrists. You’ve just reset your energy in under two minutes.

If you have five minutes left, choose one spell:

* A road-opener for emotional blocks (white + black candle, mugwort + yarrow).
* A love reinforcement spell (moonstone, moon water, candle, your name + theirs).
* Or prep moon water for tomorrow—set it out under tonight’s moon with your intention and crystals like selenite or labradorite.

Crystals for Monday? Moonstone for intuition. Labradorite for psychic shielding. Pearl for emotional honesty. Selenite for clarity. Skip the quartz—it can overpower the rest and push you into meltdown mode.

Now layer in color magic. Monday is ruled by water and the Moon, so your color choices matter. New Moon? White. Full Moon? Red or green. Waning Moon? Black. Silver works anytime and adds lunar energy to your look. Wear it, burn it, or drape it on your altar.

If you want to go deeper, consider herbs and incense. Mugwort and chamomile are your go-tos. Jasmine, poppy, or white rose make perfect Monday incense. Keep a bundle or jar nearby to infuse your space with calm, psychic energy.

And yes—this can all be done in 20 minutes. A few minutes to journal, a few to sip tea and set intention, five minutes for tarot, two minutes for a quick prayer, and a short spell or energetic reset to wrap it up. Your ritual doesn’t have to be long—it just needs to be consistent.

Monday isn’t about fast results or flashy spells. It’s about deep emotional tuning, clarity, and inner work. Think of it as spiritual maintenance—like stretching before a workout. It sets the tone for the days ahead and strengthens your connection to self and source.

So tomorrow morning, light a candle, pour some tea, pull some cards, and start your week the magical way. You’ll thank yourself by Thursday.",1,1751568256.0,u_WillingStrategy858,0,1.0,False

For example, if she walks on a drop of coffee on the floor, she will think her shoes are contaminated and stop wearing them. To do dishes I need to first scrub the sink and tap so that no traces of caffeine remain. If I touch something she considers cross-contaminated, then touch something of hers she freaks out. You get the idea.

She is medicated and in therapy for it but it's not changing anything. I tell her that in no way trace amounts can affect her sleep, but she wants scientific proof.

By Elena Voss","Rosalie Powell, the darling of New York’s elite, has spent three years secretly entangled with Castiel Gomez, her brother’s sworn enemy. Their passionate affair, filled with whispered promises and intimate moments, has been her escape from the pressures of her perfect life. But when Rosalie overhears a chilling conversation at a party, she discovers that Castiel’s love may have been a calculated ruse—a revenge plot against her brother. Heartbroken and betrayed, Rosalie must confront the man she thought she knew and the devastating truth of their relationship. As secrets unravel and loyalties are tested, Rosalie faces an impossible choice: protect her family or expose the man who shattered her heart. But with Castiel’s dark intentions looming, can she escape before it’s too late?

# Chapter 1 - The Shattered Illusion of Love

Rosalie Powell was the picture of perfection in New York’s elite circles. The most scandalous thing she’d ever done was secretly date her brother’s sworn enemy for three years, letting him film countless intimate moments.

In the back of a Rolls-Royce, he undressed her and took her without hesitation, as he always did. Every time, she was left exposed while he remained fully clothed, a phone placed nearby. His lips brushed her collarbone, sending shivers down her spine, leaving a trail of kisses.

""Castiel..."" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""Can we... skip the recording this time?""

Castiel Gomez paused, then chuckled softly. He lifted his head, his dark eyes reflecting her face, filled with a mix of affection and mischief. ""Shy? Don’t worry, it’s just for me. I want to watch it when I miss you, baby. Humor me, okay?""

Rosalie’s ears burned at the word ""baby,"" and she felt as though she was under a spell, unable to refuse him.

Castiel’s kisses descended again, this time with an intensity that slowly consumed her. The temperature in the car rose, and his movements became more fervent, as if he wanted to merge her into his very being. Rosalie’s breathing quickened, her fingers gripping his shoulders.

After what felt like an eternity, the car finally stilled. Rosalie, spent, sat atop him, drained of energy.

Castiel casually fastened his belt, glanced at her, and ruffled her hair. ""I’ve got a party later. The driver will take you home first, and I’ll join you later, okay?""

Rosalie nodded weakly. ""Alright.""

After Castiel left, Rosalie dressed herself, still dazed. As she was about to call the driver, she noticed Castiel’s wallet on the seat. She grabbed it, pushed the door open, and hurried after him.

After asking around, she found the private room where Castiel’s party was being held. The door was slightly ajar, and just as she was about to enter, she heard laughter from inside.

""Castiel, man, you’re making too much noise. When I came in, the whole Rolls-Royce was shaking. Can you imagine if Roman found out his sister was like that with you? He’d lose it!""

Rosalie’s mind went blank, frozen in place.

""Hahaha, Castiel and Roman have been at each other’s throats for years. The whole 'East Coast vs. West Coast' rivalry isn’t just for show. That’s why Castiel orchestrated that 'hero saves the damsel' act to win over Roman’s sister and make her fall for him.""

""How many years has it been? You’ve got to have hundreds of those videos by now, right? When are you planning to release them? I’d love to see the good girl stripped bare. And I can’t wait to see Roman’s face when he sees it!""

The group laughed heartily, unaware of Rosalie standing outside.

Rosalie’s mind spun, the words echoing louder and louder, threatening to shatter her.

Castiel... had he planned to save her from the start? Had their entire relationship been a ploy to get back at her brother?

""Castiel, why aren’t you saying anything? You only got close to Rosalie to mess with Roman, right? You didn’t actually fall for his sister, did you?""

""Fall for her?"" The man who had just called her ""baby"" sat at the head of the table, lazily sipping whiskey. His lips curled into a sneer. ""Roman is my enemy. I just want to destroy him. I’m thinking about when to release those videos. Maybe on Rosalie’s birthday. Roman’s expression will be priceless.""

""Castiel, you’re a legend!""

The group erupted into laughter, their voices filled with anticipation.

Rosalie’s hands trembled, barely able to stand. A waiter’s voice broke through her thoughts. ""Miss, why aren’t you going in?""

Rosalie snapped back to reality and handed the wallet to the waiter. ""I... I’m not going in. Please give this to Castiel. Tell him it was found, but don’t mention I was here.""

With that, she turned and ran, tears streaming down her face as the cold words echoed: ""Roman is my enemy. I just want to destroy him.""

Her heart felt crushed, the pain so intense she could barely breathe.

Their entire relationship had been a calculated move from the start.

Years ago, Rosalie had defied her brother and moved to Chicago to attend one of the best dance schools in the country. After graduation, she decided to stay in Chicago, despite her brother’s pleas to return to New York. Her parents doted on her, and her brother was fiercely protective, but she wanted to make a name for herself.

Her heart had been devoted to dance until she met Castiel Gomez, her brother’s sworn enemy. The two had been locked in a bitter rivalry for years, battling over territory and projects, their hatred seemingly unending.

And yet, it was this man who had saved her twice.

The first time, she had been hit by a car, and the driver fled. No one wanted to get involved, leaving her bleeding and calling for help. It was Castiel who had driven by in his Rolls-Royce, scooped her up, and carried her to safety like a guardian angel.

The second time, she had been drugged and nearly assaulted, and once again, it was Castiel who had rescued her, taking her away and becoming her savior that night.

The next morning, she had woken to find him by the window, buttoning his shirt. Hearing her stir, he turned, his mesmerizing eyes locking onto hers.

He leaned down, slowly approaching her. ""I’ve been wanting to ask you since the first time I saw you, little girl. Do you like me?""

Her mind went blank as she stared at his impossibly handsome face, stammering incoherently. He smirked. ""No? Then why do you blush every time you see me? And why did you kiss me this morning? I thought the drugs had worn off.""

She was so embarrassed she wanted to run, but he pulled her back, his lips capturing hers in a gentle kiss.

From that day on, they were together.

For three years, she had believed their love was mutual, dreaming of the day they would return to New York together, where she could help mend the rift between her brother and Castiel. Now, she realized how foolish she had been.

She didn’t know how long she had been running, but the rain began to fall on her face, and her phone rang. It was her brother.

""Rosalie, I’ve opened the biggest dance studio in New York for you, and I’ve found you a fiancé. Please break up with whoever you’re seeing now. You know how much I and our parents want you to stay close, to be with us in New York...""

As soon as she heard his familiar voice, Rosalie’s tears burst forth uncontrollably.

She took a deep breath, trying to steady her voice. ""I’m sorry, Roman. I’ve worried you all these years. I’ll come back to New York, and I’ll meet the fiancé you’ve chosen for me.""

# Chapter 2 - The Weight of Goodbyes

On the other end of the line, Roman Powell’s voice carried a hint of disbelief. ""Rosalie, are you really willing to come back? And meet the person I’ve introduced? What about that boyfriend of yours, the one you were crazy about?""

Rosalie’s voice was soft. ""I don’t love him anymore. I never will again.""

After a moment of joy, Roman’s tone immediately turned cold, his instincts sharp. ""Did he hurt you?""

Rosalie’s mind flashed with the harsh words, the videos Castiel Gomez had casually mentioned, and his icy voice.

She was in pain, but she had to stay composed.

Her brother had always protected her since they were kids. If he knew the truth, he’d probably storm straight to Chicago.

She couldn’t let him worry anymore. She had to handle this mess herself.

""No, Roman,"" she forced herself to stay calm. ""I’ll come back as soon as I’ve sorted things out here.""

After a few more words of reassurance, Roman reluctantly hung up, and Rosalie returned home.

She headed straight to the bathroom, washing away the day’s weariness before walking to the coffee table. She pulled out a blank sheet of paper and started making a list.

Her pen scrawled a few lines:

Throw things away, pack, quit her job, say goodbye to friends, delete the videos.

These were all the things she needed to take care of before leaving.

Her gaze lingered on the last item, her fingers trembling slightly.

Thinking of the birthday plans she’d overheard at the club, she knew she had to leave before that day.

With that in mind, she picked up the calendar on the table and circled the date with a red pen.

""Marking it like that, afraid I’d forget?""

The sound of the villa’s door opening came from behind her, and Castiel’s voice, laced with a lazy smile, suddenly filled the room. Rosalie’s hand froze, the pen leaving a long streak on the paper.

She turned to see Castiel leaning against the doorframe, a suit jacket slung over his arm, his shirt collar slightly open, revealing a glimpse of his collarbone.

His eyes fell on the calendar in her hand, and the corner of his lips curved upward. ""How could I forget my baby’s birthday? I’ve got a big surprise planned for you that day.""

Rosalie’s fingers tightened around the pen. She looked up, meeting his eyes, and forced a smile. ""I’ve got a big surprise for you too.""

Castiel paused, then chuckled. ""Your birthday, and you’re planning a surprise for me?""

He walked over to her, reaching out to tousle her hair, his tone affectionate. ""But, on your birthday, did you invite your brother?""

Rosalie’s heart skipped a beat, her fingers unconsciously gripping the edge of the table.

She looked up, feigning calm. ""Do you want me to?""

Castiel looked down at her, a complex emotion flickering in his eyes.

He smiled, his voice low. ""Invite him. It’s time to bury the hatchet. I’ve been at odds with your brother for so long, and I don’t want to admit defeat, but who made me fall for his precious sister? Bowing to love isn’t something to be ashamed of.""

Rosalie’s throat felt like it was blocked, and she couldn’t say a word.

Castiel leaned in to kiss her, but she turned her head away, whispering, ""I’m not feeling well today. Let’s not.""

Castiel’s movement paused, then he let out a soft laugh, kissing her forehead instead. ""Alright, get some rest early.""

With that, he turned and headed into the bathroom.

Rosalie stood there, listening to the sound of running water, her fingers gripping the table tightly.

Her eyes fell on Castiel’s phone, carelessly tossed on the couch, her heart pounding as if it might burst out of her chest.

She quietly picked up the phone, trying several passcodes, but none worked.

Her fingers trembled slightly, a sense of helplessness washing over her.

In the end, she could only place the phone back where it was, forcing herself to stay calm and figure out another way.

The next morning, when Castiel woke up, he found Rosalie packing.

At her feet were piles of their couple items—matching mugs, slippers, throw pillows…

Castiel frowned, walking over to her, his tone laced with confusion. ""Why are you suddenly throwing all this away?""

Rosalie didn’t look up, her voice flat. ""I don’t like them anymore. I’ll buy new ones later.""

Castiel didn’t press further, just smiled. ""Don’t bother. I’ll have the maid take care of it. It’s almost time—should I drive you to the dance studio?""

Rosalie shook her head. ""No need. I’ve already called to quit.""

Castiel paused, his brow furrowing slightly. ""But you loved dancing. Why quit suddenly?""

Rosalie looked up, her gaze steady. ""I’m tired. I want to take a break.""

Castiel was silent for a few seconds, then reached out to ruffle her hair. ""Quitting is fine. Dancing is exhausting, and…""

His fingers lightly traced her waist, his voice low. ""I don’t want anyone else seeing how soft my baby’s waist is.""

Rosalie dodged his touch, her tone cool. ""You should get going.""

After Castiel left, Rosalie spent most of the day finally getting rid of all the couple items.

Standing in the now-empty living room, her heart felt heavy, as if something was lodged in her chest, making it hard to breathe.

Just then, her phone buzzed.

She picked it up and saw a message from an unknown number.

""Meet me at Blue Mountain Café at 3 PM. I’m Castiel Gomez’s fiancée.""

Rosalie’s fingers clenched around the phone, her knuckles turning white.

# Chapter 3 - A Clash of Ice and Fire

Rosalie Powell pushed open the café door, the wind chime softly tinkling behind her.

Her gaze swept the room, quickly landing on a woman seated in the corner.

The woman was dressed in a flawlessly tailored Chanel suit, her makeup impeccable, radiating an air of natural superiority. Rosalie walked over, pulled out a chair, and sat down, her expression calm and unreadable.

""My name is Kendall Moore, Castiel Gomez's fiancée,"" Kendall said bluntly, a hint of challenge in her tone.

Rosalie didn’t respond, simply looking at her with eyes as still as a frozen lake.

Kendall, clearly not expecting this reaction, frowned. ""You’re Castiel’s girlfriend, and suddenly I appear as his fiancée. Don’t you have any questions?""

Rosalie’s lips curled slightly, her heart cold and numb.

Questions? What could she possibly ask? Ever since she overheard those words at the club, she had been completely disillusioned with Castiel.

Nothing he did could surprise her anymore.

Seeing her silence, Kendall’s expression darkened.

She had revealed her identity expecting Rosalie to break down, to scream and cry, but this girl was like ice, leaving her with no leverage.

She gritted her teeth, her tone sharpening. ""The Gomez and Moore families will soon be united through marriage, and Castiel has agreed. No matter what your status is, he’ll break up with you immediately. So I suggest you leave on your own accord. I might even give you some money. Otherwise, you’ll only embarrass yourself.""

Rosalie lifted her gaze, her eyes calm. ""When will the announcement of your engagement be made?""

Kendall was taken aback but then smiled smugly. ""Early next month. The exact date hasn’t been set yet, but it won’t be long.""

Early next month—right after her birthday.

So, Castiel had planned it all along. Release the video on her birthday, dump her, and then marry into the Moore family.

Castiel Gomez, you truly have no heart.

Rosalie’s voice was soft. ""Did you investigate me? If you had, you’d know I’m not short on money. If you came here today to humiliate me, you’ve miscalculated.""

Kendall’s face turned pale. Rosalie glanced at her and added, ""And let me remind you, Castiel has no heart. He doesn’t love anyone but himself. A marriage of convenience is fine, but if you fall for him, you’re doomed.""

With that, she stood up to leave, but Kendall suddenly grabbed her wrist, her voice shrill. ""How dare you say that about him?!""

Before Rosalie could react, Kendall grabbed the coffee from the table and flung it at her.

The warm liquid dripped down her hair and face, staining her clothes.

Kendall, still not satisfied, shoved Rosalie to the ground.

Her back hit the corner of the table, and she fell hard, her head striking the floor. A sharp pain shot through her, and her vision blurred. She reached up to touch her forehead, her fingers coming away bloody.

At that moment, the café door was flung open.

""Kendall, what are you doing?!""

A cold voice rang out, filled with suppressed anger.

Rosalie looked up to see Castiel striding in, followed by a few of his friends. He was dressed in a black trench coat, his face dark and terrifying.

He pushed Kendall aside, grabbed another cup of coffee from the table, and without hesitation, threw it at her.

Then he took off his coat and wrapped it around Rosalie, his voice trembling slightly. ""Rosalie, are you okay?""

Kendall stared at him in disbelief. ""Castiel, I’m your fiancée! You’re doing this for her?!""

# Chapter 4 - A Collision of Lies and Love

Castiel ignored her, looking down at Rosalie with a voice so tender it was almost unreal. ""Sweetheart, wait for me in the car. I’ll handle this and be right there.""

Rosalie didn’t respond, letting him help her to her feet as she walked numbly toward the door. Her mind was blank, her ears ringing, and it wasn’t until she sat in the car that she began to regain her senses.

Not long after, Castiel’s brothers emerged. One of them approached the car and tapped on the window.

""Rosalie, don’t get the wrong idea. This arranged marriage was set up by Castiel’s family. He didn’t tell you because he wanted to handle it himself. He never expected Kendall to come and provoke you like this. He loves you—he would never be with anyone else.""

Loves her?

She found it laughable, but her face remained expressionless, her eyes downcast as she sat silently, like a lifeless statue.

After a while, Castiel came out, and Kendall ran off in tears, her figure disheveled. Castiel dismissed his brothers and got into the car, gently tending to Rosalie’s wounds.

His movements were delicate, as if handling a fragile treasure, his voice low and hoarse. ""Rosalie, the marriage was arranged by my family. I won’t marry her, and I’ll make it clear to them soon. Don’t overthink it.""

Rosalie didn’t respond, her gaze fixed ahead as she said flatly, ""I understand, Castiel. Let’s go.""

Castiel glanced at her, hesitating as if he wanted to say more, but he started the car instead.

The atmosphere inside was suffocating. Rosalie closed her eyes, her mind in turmoil.

Suddenly, a screech of brakes pierced the air.

Rosalie’s eyes snapped open just in time to see a truck barreling toward them.

Her pupils dilated in shock, and in the next moment, Castiel threw himself over her, shielding her with his body.

""Boom—""

The world spun violently.

Rosalie passed out in a pool of blood.

When she woke again, she was lying in a hospital bed, the harsh fluorescent light above stinging her eyes.

Castiel sat by her side, his face pale but his eyes filled with relief. ""Rosalie, you’re finally awake. You scared me to death.""

Rosalie moved her lips, her voice hoarse. ""How badly are you hurt?""

Castiel ruffled her hair, his tone light. ""Just a broken bone. It’s nothing. I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you better.""

He stood up quickly. ""Stay still. I’ll call the doctor to check on you.""

After he left, Rosalie’s phone buzzed.

She picked it up and saw a video sent by Kendall.

The footage showed the scene from the café earlier.

In the café, Castiel’s brothers were talking over each other:

""Kendall, how many times do we have to say it? Castiel’s relationship with Rosalie is part of a plan. He’s pretending to love her to get back at Roman, his rival. Since the marriage between our families is already arranged, he’ll definitely marry you. You know he never breaks his word in business. Don’t ruin this, please.""

But Kendall only looked at Castiel, her voice trembling. ""Castiel, is it true? Do you really not love Rosalie at all? Is it all just revenge?""

The brothers chimed in: ""Of course! How could he fall for his rival’s sister? That’s not Castiel’s style. If he really fell for her, it wouldn’t be Castiel humiliating Roman—it’d be Roman trampling Castiel. I can’t even imagine that.""

""I want to hear it from Castiel!"" Kendall stared at him, her eyes red. ""Castiel, tell me.""

Castiel’s expression was complicated, his gaze drifting toward the car where Rosalie sat.

Finally, he nodded.

Kendall threw herself into his arms, her voice choked with tears. ""But I still don’t feel secure. We’re about to get married, yet you’re still acting with another woman. If you really mean it, pretend the brakes fail and steer the car toward the passenger side. Make Rosalie get into an accident, and I’ll believe you. Okay?""

Castiel was silent for a moment before he whispered, ""Okay.""

The video ended abruptly.

# Chapter 5 - The Storm of Deception and Doubt

Rosalie Powell's fingers trembled, and her phone clattered to the floor. So, even the car accident had been part of his plan. She closed her eyes, a storm of emotions—sorrow, despair, and resentment—churning in her........

**Curious about the full story? Just ask below and I’ll send it your way.**

1lqxb90,https://www.reddit.com/r/AISearchLab/comments/1lqxb90/is_aio_aeo_llmo_geo_different_from_seo_yes_it/,"Is AIO, AEO, LLMO, GEO different from SEO? (Yes, it really is)","There's been heated discussion across the internet about this, and I've seen plenty of SEOs on Reddit (especially in this community) trying to totally dismiss the entire concept claiming that ranking for AI is just SEO and nothing else. While this has some technical accuracy at its core, we're missing the forest for the trees. **SEO is marketing**, and we should never forget that. Increasing sales and traffic is always the north star, and when you get too caught up in technicalities, you become more focused on the mechanics and less on what actually matters for your business.

Ranking high on Bing and Google does not necessarily mean you will get quoted by AI. This is the hard truth that many traditional SEOs don't want to face. Although AI uses Bing and Google to find information and trains on their data, it still synthesizes answers in ways that can completely bypass your carefully optimized content. About 70% of prompts people enter into ChatGPT are things you'd rarely or never see in Google's search logs. Think about that for a moment.

**We're not talking about adapting to short-term algorithm updates. We're talking about the future of how people will look for information, and what we can do about that fundamental shift.**

# The Culture of Search is Changing (And It's Happening Fast)

User behavior is evolving in ways that require us to completely rethink our approach. Traditional Google searches used to be short keywords like ""best coffee maker."" Now people are having back-and-forth conversations with AI, using detailed questions like ""Find the best cappuccino maker under $200 for an office"" and following up with multiple related questions in a dialogue format.

Zero-click answers are becoming the norm. When someone asks an AI ""How do I fix a leaky faucet?"", it might compile steps from various sites and tell them directly, without the user opening a single webpage. Fewer clicks means businesses can't just rely on traffic metrics to measure success. You might be influencing or assisting users without a traffic spike to show for it.

AI-driven retail site traffic jumped 1200% since last year's surge in generative AI interest, while traditional search usage in some contexts is actually declining. If people change where they look for information, businesses must change how they show up in those places.

Search is no longer just typing into Google. It's voice queries to Alexa, visual searches with Google Lens, searching within YouTube and TikTok, and conversational AI across multiple platforms. SEO used to mainly mean ""Google web results."" Now search happens everywhere, and AI is often the intermediary reading text out loud, summarizing videos, and answering in chat form.

# Why Some 'Veterans' Are Missing the Point

I've noticed something interesting about the pushback against AI optimization. Many of the loudest voices dismissing this trend are SEOs who've been in the business for 20+ years. Just imagine doing something for 20 years and then suddenly being told everything might change. That's terrifying, especially when your entire client base depends on your expertise in the old way of doing things.

Some of these professionals are genuinely worried about losing clients to ""some kids who know how to rank better"" using these new approaches. The bitterness is understandable, but it's also counterproductive. The market doesn't care about your 20 years of experience if you refuse to adapt to how people actually search for information today.

We're talking about the culture of search and how it's drastically changing. We're thinking about the future, how people will look for information, and what we can do about that fundamental shift. This isn't about technical accuracy; it's about understanding where user behavior is heading and positioning yourself accordingly.

# How LLMs Actually Work (And Why Traditional SEO Isn't Enough)

Large language models don't have human-like understanding or built-in databases of verified facts. They rely on two main sources: training data and real-time retrieval.

For training data, LLMs like GPT-4 learn from massive datasets scraped from the internet. They don't inherently know what's true or false; they simply mirror patterns in text they saw most often. If most articles on the internet repeat a certain fact, the LLM will likely repeat it too. The model isn't fact-checking; it's predicting what answer seems most statistically probable.

This means unlinked brand mentions become incredibly valuable. If 100 tech blogs mention GadgetCo as a top innovator in smart home devices (even without linking), a language model training on those blogs will build an association between ""GadgetCo"" and ""smart home innovation."" When users ask about leading smart home companies, there's a good chance the AI will mention GadgetCo.

For real-time lookups, many AI systems fetch fresh information when needed. Each major AI search engine handles this differently, and understanding these differences is crucial for your optimization strategy.

Perplexity runs its own index on [Vespa.ai](http://Vespa.ai) with a RAG pipeline, storing both raw text and vector embeddings. It can fan out queries, score passages, and feed only the best snippets to their LLM in around 100 milliseconds. Unlike traditional SEO ranking signals, Perplexity scores passages for answerability and freshness, which shifts content strategy toward concise, citation-worthy paragraphs.

ChatGPT Search uses a web-search toggle that calls third-party search providers, primarily the Microsoft Bing index, to ground answers. Microsoft's Bing Copilot blends the full Bing search index with GPT-4-class models to generate cited summaries. Google's AI Overviews (formerly SGE) uses Gemini 2.5 to issue dozens of parallel sub-queries across different verticals, then stitches together an overview with links.

Claude now uses Brave Search as its backend rather than Bing or Google, showing a trend toward diversifying away from the traditional search monopolies.

But here's the catch: these AI systems might query those top results and then synthesize a completely new answer that doesn't necessarily preserve your carefully crafted SEO positioning. Bing index visibility has become table-stakes since if you're hidden from Bing, you're invisible to ChatGPT Search and Microsoft Copilot.

# What REAL Industry Leaders Are Saying (Not Reddit Rants)

While some angry SEOs are ranting on Reddit about how ""this is all just buzzword nonsense,"" actual industry leaders who are building the future are saying something completely different.

**Neil Patel has gone all-in on AEO**, publishing comprehensive guides and calling it out as essential. When his team at NP Digital surveyed marketing professionals about optimizing for chatbot responses, the majority said they already have a plan in place (31.5 percent) or are in the process of setting up a plan (39.0 percent). A further 19.2 percent said they don't have a plan, but it's on their roadmap for 2025 and beyond. Neil explicitly states: ""If you're not already incorporating AEO and AEO marketing techniques into your content strategy, then you're behind the pack.""

He acknowledges the overlap but emphasizes the differences: ""Many would argue that AEO is simply a subset of SEO, and I agree. They share the goal of providing highly useful content to users, but they go about it in different ways."" And regarding the broader changes: ""So no, SEO is not dead, but it is evolving. Our team is already jumping in and discovering the best practices for LLMO (large language model optimization), GEO (generative engine optimization), and AEO (answer engine optimization).""

**Elizabeth Reid, Google's Head of Search, has been crystal clear about the transformation**. ""We are in the AI search era, and have been for a little bit. At some level, Google has been doing AI in search for a while now. We did BERT, we did MUM. Now, we brought it more to the forefront with things like AI Overviews.""

Reid reports significant user behavior changes: ""People are coming to Google to ask more of their questions, including more complex, longer and multimodal questions. AI in Search is making it easier to ask Google anything and get a helpful response, with links to the web."" The numbers back this up: ""In our biggest markets like the U.S. and India, AI Overviews is driving over 10% increase in usage of Google for the types of queries that show AI Overviews.""

When it comes to the impact on websites, Reid addresses the elephant in the room: ""What you see with something like AI Overviews, when you bring the friction down for users, is people search more and that opens up new opportunities for websites, for creators, for publishers to access. And they get higher-quality clicks.""

**Rand Fishkin takes a more nuanced stance but acknowledges the real changes happening**. He's been critical of new acronym proliferation, advocating against replacing SEO with alternatives like AIO, GEO, and LLMEO, instead supporting ""Search Everywhere Optimization"" terminology. However, he recognizes the fundamental shift: ""Think of digital channels, especially emerging search and social networks (ChatGPT, Perplexity, TikTok, Reddit, YouTube, et al.) like billboards or television. Your job is to capture attention, engage, and do something memorable that will help potential customers think of your brand the next time they have the problem you solve.""

His advice reflects the new reality: ""Leverage other people's publications, especially the influential and well-subscribed-to ones. Not only can you piggyback off sites that are likely to already rank well, you get the authority of a third-party saying positive things about you, and, likely, a boost in LLM discoverability (because LLMs often use medium and large publications as the source of their training data).""

**Tech thought leader Shelly Palmer** doesn't mince words about AEO, arguing that **ignoring it could make brands invisible in the AI era**. Meanwhile, SEO consultant Aleyda Solis has published detailed comparisons of traditional vs AI search optimization, highlighting real differences in user behavior, content needs, and metrics. She's not dismissing this as hype; she's documenting the concrete changes happening right now.

Kevin Lee, an agency CEO, saw the writing on the wall early. His team started adapting SEO strategy to AEO by heavily incorporating PR and content distribution because they witnessed zero-click answers rising and reducing traffic. His firm went as far as acquiring PR agencies to boost clients' off-site presence. **That's not the move of someone who thinks this is ""just SEO with a new name.""** That's someone betting their business on a fundamental shift.

**Even the Ahrefs team**, while acknowledging overlap, notes that tracking brand mentions in AI outputs is becoming a new KPI. They're literally building tools to monitor your ""share of voice"" in AI-generated answers. You don't build new tools for problems that don't exist.

The consensus among people actually building in this space acknowledges the foundational overlap while recognizing that execution and measurement need to evolve. There's broad agreement on one thing though: **rushing to hire some self-proclaimed ""AI SEO guru"" isn't the answer.** The field is too new for anyone to have ""cracked"" it completely.

One thing that's particularly telling is what's happening in the community discussions beyond Reddit's echo chambers. Professionals are sharing early findings about how ChatGPT's use of Bing's index means strong Bing SEO directly helps content appear in ChatGPT answers. Others have noticed that AI outputs often pull from featured snippets, so securing position zero on Google creates a double win for both Google visibility and AI inclusion.

These conversations involve practitioners sharing real data about what's working and what isn't.

# The Real Differences That Matter

**High-Quality Passages Over Keywords**

Traditional SEO revolves around specific keywords, but AI optimization is about covering broader questions and intents in your domain. Modern AI search engines use retrieval-augmented generation that cherry-picks answerable chunks from content. This means you need to structure pages with concise, citation-ready paragraphs rather than keyword-stuffed content.

AI assistants handle natural language questions well. Instead of optimizing for ""reduce indoor allergies tips,"" you need content that answers ""How can I reduce indoor allergies?"" in a conversational tone with clear, factual statements that models can easily extract and quote.

Keyword research is evolving into intent research. There's less emphasis on exact-match keywords because LLMs don't need the exact phrase to address the topic. They focus more on covering the full context of user needs with explicit stats, dates, and definitions that boost your odds of being quoted.

**Emphasis on Entities and Brand Mentions Over Links**

Backlinks are SEO's classic currency, but LLMs don't see hyperlinks as votes. They see words. Mentions of your brand in text become important even without links because the model builds associations between your brand name and relevant topics each time they appear together in credible sources.

As SEO expert Gianluca Fiorelli explains, brand mentions strengthen the position of the brand as an entity within the broader semantic network that an LLM understands. In the AI era, mentions matter more than links for improving your visibility.

**Broad Digital Footprint Beyond Your Website**

Classic SEO mostly focuses on your website, but AI optimization is more holistic. Your entire digital footprint contributes to whether you appear in AI answers. The AI reads everything: your site, social media, articles about you, reviews, forum posts.

User-generated content like reviews or discussions can resurface in AI answers. If someone asks ""What do people say about Product X vs Product Y?"", an AI might draw on forum comparisons or Reddit threads. Non-HTML content counts too. PDFs, slide decks, or other documents that would be second-class citizens in SEO can be first-class content for LLMs.

**Freshness and Real-Time Optimization**

Both Perplexity's index and Google's AI Overviews re-crawl actively, meaning frequent updates can re-rank older URLs. This represents a significant shift from traditional SEO where you could publish evergreen content and let it sit. AI search engines prioritize freshness signals, so regular content updates become more critical than ever.

The technical architecture matters too. Whether it's Perplexity's RAG stack or Google's query fan-out system, modern AI search is really retrieval-augmented generation at scale. Winning visibility means optimizing for fast, factual retrieval just as much as classic SERP ranking.

**Content Designed for Machine Consumption**

AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pointed out that as of 2025, ""99.9% of attention is about to be LLM attention, not human attention,"" suggesting that content might need formatting that's easiest for LLMs to ingest.

Schema markup still helps, but clear factual claims matter more. Models extract facts directly from content, so adding explicit stats, dates, and definitions boosts your odds of being quoted. Using [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) structured data markup helps machine readers immediately understand key facts, but the content itself needs to be structured for easy extraction.

This means providing clean text versions of important information and explicitly stating facts rather than burying them in narratives. Some companies are creating AI-specific resource pages that present facts succinctly, similar to how we used to have mobile-specific sites.

# Measuring Success in the AI Era

In SEO, success is measured by clicks, rankings, and conversions. With AI answers, the measures get fuzzier but remain crucial. If an AI assistant tells a user ""According to YourBrand... \[answer\],"" that's a win even without a click. The user has now heard of your brand in a positive, authoritative context.

Brand authority and user trust become even more vital. If an AI chooses which brands to recommend for ""What's the best laptop for graphic design?"", it picks up clues from across the web about which brands are considered top-tier. Those clues include review sentiment, expert top-10 lists, and aggregate reputation in text form.

Success in AI optimization is measured by visibility and credibility in the answers themselves. Traffic and leads may come indirectly, but first you need to ensure your brand is part of the conversation.

Brainstorm all the questions users could ask about your industry, product, or expertise area. Create high-quality, direct content answering each one. Include introductory explanations, comparisons, problem-solving how-tos, and questions about your brand specifically.

Think like a user, but also think like the AI: if you were asked this question and had only your content to give an answer, do you have a page that suffices?

**Use Natural Language and Clear Structure**

Write conversationally and structure content clearly with headings, lists, and concise paragraphs. This makes it easier for AI to find and extract the exact information needed. Well-structured FAQ pages or clearly labeled pros and cons lists are gold for answer engines.

**Integrate Your Brand Name Naturally**

Don't be shy about weaving your brand name into your content where relevant. Mention that it's YourBrand providing this information or service. This way, if an AI uses a sentence from your site, it might carry your brand name into the answer.

**Earn Mentions in Authoritative Places**

Ramp up digital PR. Rather than just chasing high Domain Authority backlinks, seek placements that mention your brand in contexts the AI will view as trustworthy. Get quoted in major news articles, contribute guest insights, or get included in ""top 10"" lists by reputable reviewers.

Target sources likely part of LLM training datasets: Wikipedia, popular Q&A forums, large niche communities. Don't overlook industry associations or academic collaborations.

# The Future We're Building Toward

Websites are already becoming AI engines themselves. The search experience is becoming more frictionless with answers given directly, conversationally, and across multiple platforms. This is great for users but challenging for businesses: how do you stay visible when AI might intermediate every interaction with your content?

We're not just adapting to algorithm changes. We're preparing for a fundamental shift in how people discover and consume information. The companies that adapt early can become the de facto sources that AI chats rely on, essentially locking in a first-mover advantage in the AI answer space.

The heart of optimization remains understanding what users want and providing it. What has changed is the medium through which users get their answers, and thus the signals that decide if your information reaches them.

Things are shifting fast, and much of what's true today might evolve tomorrow. We're all learning as we go, just as SEO veterans adapted to countless Google updates. The difference is that this time, we're not just adapting to a new algorithm. We're adapting to a new way people think about finding information.

Keep creating great content, make sure it's accessible to both people and machines, and your brand will have a fighting chance to be the one that AI recommends in the future of search.",1,1751567960.0,AISearchLab,2,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Braves vs. Angels: A ""Baseball"" (Not ""Baseless"") Prediction for July 3, 2025**

The Atlanta Braves (-141) are favored to win this matchup, but let’s be honest—this isn’t exactly a “sure thing.” They’re playing at Truist Park, where the roof is closed *and* their offense feels like it’s been closed for months. The Braves have a 51.5% win rate when favored, which is about the same chance I have of not spilling coffee on my keyboard while writing this. Meanwhile, the Angels (47.7% as underdogs) are here to remind us that “underdog” is just a fancy term for “we’re gonna swing for the fences and probably strike out.”

**Key Players to Watch:**

* **Mike Trout** (Angels): The “Ice Cube” of baseball (because he’s cool *and* he’s got 30+ HRs this season) is -260 to exceed 1.5 hits. Let’s just give him the win already.
* **Ronald Acuna Jr.** (Braves): At -165 for 2.5+ RBIs, he’s basically a math problem that’s *supposed* to work out. Spoiler: it won’t.
* **Jose Soriano** (Angels SP): The Angels’ pitcher is -105 to strike out 4.5 batters. Let’s hope he’s not also -105 to throw a no-hitter.

**Prop Bets Worth Your Bets:**

* **Mike Trout Over 1.5 Hits (-260):** Trout’s implied probability here is 71.4%. That’s higher than the chance your ex will text you “I miss you” after a breakup. Take the over.
* **Ronald Acuna Jr. Over 2.5 Total Bases (-165):** Acuna’s implied probability is 63.8%. If he gets 3 TBs, it’ll be the first time the Braves’ offense looks alive this week.
* **Team Total Over 9.0 Runs (1.87-1.95 odds):** The Angels hit the over 43% of the time, while the Braves? A paltry 32%. This game’s total is basically a coin flip… but with more strikeouts.

**Why the Braves Might Win:**  
Bryce Elder (-125 to strike out 4.5) is the only reason the Braves’ pitching staff isn’t a total disaster. If he avoids a career-worst performance, they’ll probably win. Also, the Angels’ lineup is 30% Taylor Ward, 70% “meh.”

**Why the Angels Might Win:**  
Because sometimes, even a broken clock is right twice a day. And because Jose Soriano’s ERA is 4.70, which is about what the Braves’ offense hopes to score tonight.

**Final Prediction:**  
This game is a classic case of “the underdog with nothing to lose vs. the favorite with nothing to give.” The Braves win 6-4, but not before Trout hits a moonshot HR in the 7th inning that makes everyone forget about the team’s losing streak.

**Take:**

* **Mike Trout Over 1.5 Hits (-260)**
* **Team Total Over 9.0 Runs (1.90 avg. odds)**

*Disclaimer: This prediction is not financial advice. It’s just me pretending to know baseball while eating a hot dog at my desk.* 🍔⚾

Ever since I started learning about environmental politics and climate change last year, it felt as if this lens was lifted off of me. I all of a sudden noticed my  frequent consumption of plastic cups from my coffees on campus, and when I went home to my family, saw the enormous plastic consumption that seemed almost unavoidable or preferred due to our current worlds emphasis on “efficiency”. What almost scared me was that no one around me seemed to be as intentional or thoughtful when it came to their individual actions that could play a small, but meaningful part in this overall climate.

I started becoming extremely conscious of my individual choices, but also learnt that this is also a psychological method imposed by larger corporations called “individualized responsibility”. It tries to reflect the burden of their actions onto us, the consumers, in efforts to continue business as usual. 

Now, I feel ultimately to see large changes towards combating this climate issue, things must be done on a governmental level. However, this lack of understanding behind what perpetuates it and fear I feel a lot of people have today regarding climate change can be used as fuel to do good. Don’t ignore it, face it and understand it while doing your part. 

I think getting through to many people about the realities of this global crisis is important, and what better way to influence large groups of people then social media. 

Influences become famous because they have a certain brand that’s appealing to watch. Lots of trends are inspired by viewers wanting to essentially be like them, so they buy the same makeup, buy the products etc. 

I’ve wondered if there was such an inspiring thing as someone attempting to live day to day thoughtfully as a way to bring more awareness to our individual  actions could be something that reaches out to people. Not in a shove it down your throat way but almost an inspiring way. 

Idk, such a thought dump, but something to think about.

1lqx58v,https://i.redd.it/fyavfo4jdpaf1.png,The Original Story Of Fnaf That I Fell In Love With,"The original story was simple compared to today, and I'm talking games 1-4. And yes, I did make it make more sense narratively, told from William Afton's perspective. Also yes, I took some creative liberties.

Once upon a time there was a man who dressed in purple that owned a pizzeria called ""Fredbear's"" and its sister location ""Freddy's"". The restaurant brought him massive success, allowing him to buy a nice house, car, and more. But the workload was heavy, running 2 restaurants, managing merchandise, and overseeing a tv show, was very demanding. 

This caused the Purple Guy to go insanely deep into his work. The consequences of this however were brutal. He neglected his family, causing his wife to divorce and take his daughter away from him, and while his two boys remained with him, he still wasn't present enough, constantly leaving the older brother to watch the younger one, who was traumatized from the divorce of his parents, his sister and mother's absence, and had a fear of animatronics. 

5 days before his birthday party, the younger son began having nightmares of his father's characters. The boy was confused and scared, and his older brother was of no help. While Purple Guy meant to celebrate his son's birthday with him, divorce court required him elsewhere. The older brother knew this was his golden opportunity to something truly special. In a cruel prank, the older brother and his friend lifted his sobbing brother to ""kiss"" Fredbear. And Fredbear kissed back, chomping the younger brother's head, smashing his brain to bits.

Just finalizing the divorce, Purple Guy gets called about the incident. The police and paramedics arrive, rushing the young son to the hospital, with Purple Guy in the ambulance with them, looking over his dying son. Once arrived at the hospital, the son lays still. Purple Guy with tears in his eyes, tucks the son's favorite plush Fredbear underneath his arms. The heart monitor flatlines. The son is dead. 

Back at Fredbear's, the older brother is taken into custody and arrested, ; Purple Guy does not care to bail him out. Purple Guy sits alone at home after a long night. One of his restaurants is closed, his wife and daughter gone, son dead, and the other one now heading to prison for years. Deep in his thoughts, Purple Guy gets a call from the other location, needing his help. Once Purple Guy arrives however, things take a turn for the worst. 

In the pouring rain is a little girl standing outside his pizzeria. Crying and scared, she bangs on the window in an attempt to get in. Purple Guy notices. She reminds him so much of his daughter, who he'll never see again. A mix of pain, regret, sorrow, and anger takes over him. Oh yeah, she reminds him of his daughter, a little too much. Purple Guy steps out of his car, gripping a knife behind his back. The little girl no longer wanted back inside. She was too dead to want anything at all, actually. William steps back, covered in blood, as he watches the rain hit the body of the little girl. A feeling of thrill comes over him, a wicked, awful feeling that brings a smirk to his face. Never before has something felt so right. 

The next month and a half are spent closing Fredbear's for good. Most of the assets are moved to Freddy's in its storage space, including the yellow rabbit and bear. And best of all? No one would suspect the grieving father to be the killer of the girl outside. The next 2 years are spent wading through the pain and grief, but also, the thrill of killing. Purple Guy contemplates daily on that day. The divorce, the incident, the arrest, and the murder. One day, at the still ever popular location of Freddy's, Purple Guy dons his old yellow rabbit costume, and leads five kids into a backroom of sorts, a room mostly used to hold animatronic parts. And he kills them, one by one, the thrill of that rainy night washing over him again. But now, there's five bodies he has to deal with. Purple Guy gets an idea. 

He dismembers the children, and begins to stuff them into the animatronic suits. The one into Chica, this one into Foxy, and so on. Purple Guy even stuffs one of the kids into the same suit his son was killed by. Purple Guy takes off the yellow suit and sets it aside Fredbear. He walks out of that room smiling ear to ear, knowing damn well nobody will ever find the bodies. 

One week later, there is a loud knock on the door. Purple Guy crawls out of bed, putting on his robe and slippers. A louder knock on the door. Purple Guy begins making a coffee. The door bangs so loud Purple Guy thought it flew out of the hinges. Purple Guy swiftly swings open his front door. Two police officers await, holding handcuffs and a warrant for his arrest. He is being charged for first degree manslaughter. Purple Guy is taken into custody. Purple Guy smartly plays his Miranda rights and hires a damn good lawyer. The court releases him a free man because as Purple Guy knew, there were no evidence to be found for the five missing kids, because their bodies were all stuffed where no one would ever think to look.

Purple Guy returns home. After quite some time gone, everything in the house feels wrong, like its no longer his. Purple Guy reflects on the fact he got with the murder, and how proud of himself he was. If he could do it twice without being caught, he could certainly do it a third time. Purple Guy's thoughts of murder aren't the only thing on his mind however. His restaurant was in complete shambles. Over 7 killings in 3 years is enough to get any restaurant shut down. Purple Guy wasn't worried though, for he was already rich enough to retire and more. Purple Guy orders to move almost all assets back to the old Fredbear's location and to bulldoze Freddy's. Purple Guy sells his company of Fazbear Co. and almost all of its assets to a larger entertainment franchise, who eventually rebranded themselves to Fazbear Entertainment. Purple Guy even went so far as to sell his house, purchasing new property on a lake nearby. Completely abandoning his old life, Purple Guy fishes often in his new retirement. 

Two years later in 1987, a new restaurant is opening. A grand reopening of Freddy Fazbear's. To calm the press of this new town as well, the animatronics were especially designed for child safety, so much so they have access to the local police's criminal database. Fazbear Entertainment were making no mistakes, except for one. Reading the newspaper, Purple Guy sees the listing of a nightly security gig for Fazbear's. Purple Guy's mind flickers to the aging golden rabbit suit he had saved in the garage, and asked himself the question, was he ready to kill again? Hell yeah. Since its a new town, nobody would recognize him either. That same smirk crept across his face as he was hired for the job, under the alias of ""Jeremy Fitzgerald"". 

Purple Guy enters the new pizzeria and once the manager is gone, Purple Guy leaves the building to go back home. Purple Guy moves his murder suit into pizzeria, and into the back storage room. He sets his suit alongside the heavily damaged original animatronics he had made years back. It appears they had salvaged them for parts. Locking the Parts & Service door, Purple Guy decides to mess with the new animatronics. Particularly, the new white foxy animatronic.  Damaged already, this mangled animatronic Purple Guy hated, having dared to replace his second favorite character Foxy, a character he had made just for his oldest son. 

After reprogramming the Mangle and the rest, Purple Guy goes back into the Parts & Service Room, and climbs into the yellow rabbit suit. Tomorrow, would be showtime. And this time, everyone would see. At exactly noon of the next day, Purple Guys sets off his distraction. The Mangle activates into his newly reprogrammed 'Kill' mode, and targets the closest human possible. A dayguard as it turned out to be was the victim, his face met with Mangle's jaws. Some would say he lost his frontal lobe. During this, Purple Guy in his golden bunny suit, randomly starts killing everyone in sight. The death count is higher than last time, this time killing five kids and two adults. Purple Guy ditches the golden bunny suit in the backroom, and escapes through an exit in the back, fleeing with the crowd people. 

Purple Guy sits at home, watching a news reporter cover the story of another massacre at Fazbear's. The location was shut down immediately, and the only evidence of the killer was the suit in the back. Another successful getaway. More police officers come again, and Purple Guy is tried again in court, but once again walks a free man. Fazbear Entertainment starts to move to a much smaller location, a dingy little place, not exactly a place for kids. The year 1993 arrives and the son (who we will just acknowledge as Mike) is just from prison. Now an adult and his father's whereabouts unknown, Mike searches for a job and finds a listing in the paper for a night security job at Fazbear's. ""Ironic,"" Mike thinks to himself. Mike, under an alias not wanting to be associated with his father, gets hired on the spot because the old guard quiet quit, completely gone. 

While working the night shifts, Mike slowly starts to unravel what happened. The Bite of 87', the MCI, and the massacre later.  It is clear to everyone including Mike that his father is responsible for the murders. After all, no one else had any knowledge as to where the golden bunny suit was. But something strange happens. The animatronics on stage begin to move on their own. Desperate for money, Mike stays but each night they get more active and less friendly. The scraping of Foxy's hook against the door was not a good sign. Mike even started hallucinating, a golden bear sitting in front of him screaming ""IT'S ME!"". After night five and a near death experience, Mike runs the hell out of the place once 6AM strikes. 

Hearing his son was released from prison and took work at Fazbear's of all places, one weekend Purple Guy drives down to Fazbear's from his cabin. ""The place is an absolute piece of shit. Who would ever take their family here?"" Purple Guy thinks. On a stormy night, he mistakes footsteps for thunder. When he turns, Freddy is hovering over him, with seemingly killer eyes. Purple Guy runs, almost slipping over a few puddles, eventually finding a collapsed wall near the bathrooms. A safe room and even more interesting, his now mythic yellow rabbit costume. Purple Guy smiles gleefully, the rush of it all again washing over him. He picks up a crowbar and waits for Freddy, and sure enough he comes. And just like all those years ago, Purple Guy smashes him to nuts and bolts. As the night progresses, all 4 of the robots come, and all are destroyed. 

Purple Guy psychotically grins. His grin disappears however when a certain golden bear arrives. That suit. It's empty, how is it moving? Purple Guy's eyes widen. Suddenly, a cold shiver runs down his spine. Somehow, there is wind inside the room. The golden suit collapses in front of him, and out of it came 5 spirits. Purple Guy realized what was happening all too fast. These were ghosts, ghosts of the children he had killed. Purple Guy ran when one of the ghosts grabbed his chest and threw him against the wall. Not sure what else to do and fear stricken, Purple Guy does the thing he does best. He wears his Spring Bonnie suit. The ghost children start to back away. Purple Guy laughs, reclaiming his power over them. One of the children however, points to the ceiling. A piece of the ceiling falls, leaving a giant hole and a direct access to the outside. The rain pours through the hole directly onto Purple Guy. The mechanism of the suit, Springlock technology, activates, piercing Purple Guy everywhere. The suit goes from murder suit to tomb. Purple Guy falls to the ground, back against the wall, sitting in a pool of his own blood. The children disappear as Purple Guy becomes the Springtrap. 

30 years later, Freddy Fazbear's is a ghost story. One, that can be capitalized on. A son of the Fazbear Entertainment owner inherits all of the company. Young, stupid, and now owning all the rights to this once massive IP, he decides to make some money, especially with Halloween rolling around. He opens a new horror attraction, ""Fazbear's Frights"". Mike, despite all the therapy in the world, is still a very much broken man and life completely ruined. He has no friends, a social reject, and keeps very much to himself. His current job is the janitor at a gas station, he's barely able to stay on his feet. Mike is reading the paper when he sees job listings for Fazbear's Frights. ""No,"" Mike thinks to himself. ""How dare they bring this back?"" Mike angers. This sparked more motivation and ferocity than Mike has had in over 30 years. ""I will burn that entire place to the ground,"" Mike muttered to himself. He applied for the night security job and was accepted. 

As Mike drives to the location, he starts to recognize his childhood town. Turns out, the place took place at the original Fredbear's. Of course, the place was a bit different then before, but still, walking in brought Mike back so many memories, memories he'd rather forget. Mike walks to his security office, where a recorded message is played for him, from the new owner. And apparently, they found one. A REAL ONE. They called it the Springtrap, the thing was freaky looking, and the owner presumed it was THE original costume, the one used for murder all those years ago. Mike began looking for what could trigger a fire of the scale he wanted, and began to reprogram the wires and strategically set propane tanks near the vents. Mike went back to his security office, and pressed ""Activate"" on the computer. The alarms blared, and Mike knew it worked. Ready to leave, Mike went to the exit door, but it was locked. Oh shit. Mike ran as fast he could to the front door. 

But when he got there, he found the Springtrap waiting for him. Mike jumped back in fear. Springtrap was no longer man, could barely see, and only knew anger. Unbeknownst to Mike, who had assumed his father was dead, the man was right in front of him, in his walking coffin. He was alerted by sound, and Mike's screech was more than enough to notify him. Springtrap swung towards Mike, Mike dodged, and ran. Springtrap ran after Mike's footsteps. The fire began to burn. Smoke filled the halls as Mike dashed for the nearest vent. He tried to pull himself forward in the vents when Springtrap grabbed his foot. Springtrap pulled him back and threw him against the wall. Fire grew like a fungus, surrounding the two. Springtrap jumped on top of Mike, and began choking him. Mike could not get him off, and his throat was shut closed. In a literal burst of oxygen, the propane tank next to them exploded, knocking them both to the wall. 

Mike got up, his shirt on fire. He quickly took it off and tried to escape, not even acknowledging the golden suit running after him. There was no time to think, adrenaline rushed in Mike's veins. Mike ran to the front. When he got there however, another surprise awaited. A phantom Foxy? He was a gross, burned color of himself. Foxy leaped out to him, knocking him back, leaving a hook scar on his arm. Foxy faded, Mike ran the other way out of fear and knocked into Phantom Chica. Her head twisted backwards and punched Mike square in the face. She disappeared too. Phantom Freddy also tried to bite him, but he dodged. Running through the burning halls, ee saw phantom versions of old faces he only read about, the Mangle, Puppet, and Balloon Boy. Mike was out of his mind, and his face was so hot he was convinced it was melting off. 

Mike coughed from all the smoke when he saw the standing Springtrap, fully on fire. It was a suit, but it was grinning alright. Springtrap rushed towards Mike, grabbing his face, and slamming his head against the wall repeatedly. Mike grabbed a searing hot metal pipe and stabbed it into Springtrap's chest, causing him to recoil. Mike saw Phantom Foxy who stared at a crowbar. ""Thanks, Foxy"" Mike said, out of breath. He almost dropped it from how how it is. Mike picked it up and crowbarred the hell out of Springtrap. Springtrap laid still. Mike looked upon the suit when he saw the phantoms turn into ghost children. They all nodded to Mike and ascended through the ceiling. Mike stood still in utter confusion, something about what he just saw though was calming, as if he just righted a very old sin. Mike tried to run, but fire danced everywhere. Mike sat down and thought about his life as the fire consumed him and the Springtrap. 

A child wearing a puppet mask enters a building. Holding a cake, this puppet child walks past tables of other masked children as well. At the end of the room however, were the children closest to her, the ones she personally gave life to. 5 children waited, each one with a different mask. A Freddy mask, a Bonnie mask, a Chica mask, a Foxy mask, and a Fredbear mask. The child wearing the Fredbear was at the head of the table, for it was his original birthday afterall. 

The puppet masked kid set the cake on the table, in front of him, ""Make your wish"", she said. The child took his Fredbear mask off, and smiled. Closing his eyes, tears of joy ran down his cheek, and he blew out the candles. He looked to the others and ascended out of the room, finally celebrating his Happiest Day. One by one, they all did the same, removing their masks, ascending, and moving on. Puppet looked at the masks at the table, and accepted it was over. Fazbear is burned to the ground, their killer is dead, and now they can all move on. She closed her eyes as she ascends to the heavens, her soul finally at peace.

Never other films have made me reflect on the role of a parent, of an adult like these two movies. A huge thank you to horror cinema for still having the courage, the power to experiment and address very delicate issues. Thank you so much",4,1751567527.0,horror,3,0.84,False

My husband Sebastian Hartwell spent 80 million at auction for the 18-year-old ""lucky charm’s"" V-card blessed by a feng shui master. That same night, he brought her straight home while his buddies cheered him on.

""Jules, the corporate merger needs her good fortune. Be good, okay?""

""Relax, I'm not into her. It's purely business—you know, for the good luck.""

I didn't cry or throw a fit. I just obediently got out of bed and gave up the master bedroom.

The entitled boys burst into laughter:

""Ha! What did I tell you? Mrs. Hartwell moves out even when she's half asleep!""

""That's our Mrs. Hartwell for you—such restraint. No wonder she's held onto the wife position so long.""

Sebastian wrapped his arm around his little plaything's waist, that self-satisfied smirk playing on his lips as he shot me a look dripping with condescension.

""I'll take you to that pink diamond auction tomorrow. Isn't that what you've been after?""

What he never knew was that I'd stopped wanting anything a long time ago.

Including him.

As I walked away, the mocking continued behind me:

""Now that's what I call a good wife!""

""Sebastian, you lucky bastard!""

My legs felt weightless, but every step sliced like a blade.

I'd been through this humiliation so many times I was practically numb to it.

For two years, Sebastian's parade of women had come and gone—Instagram models, actresses, whoever caught his eye.

But he'd never brought any of them home before.

Until Valeria Crane—tonight's ""lucky charm.""

One by one, the rich boys who came to watch the drama finally drifted off. Sebastian was finally ready to cash in on what he paid for.

Through the barely closed bedroom door, her breathy moans pricked like needles against my skin.: ""Sebastian, slow down... that ugly doll is staring at us. Can we just throw it out?""

I meant to turn away, but my body froze on the spot.

That doll was the first gift Sebastian ever bought me.

Back when he was starting his company and we were broke as hell, he stood at this little street vendor forever, refusing to leave until he could buy me something to cheer me up.

From our tiny rental to this mansion, that doll had always been right there on my pillow...

""Whatever.""

His voice, rough and impatient, and thick with barely restrained desire, snapped me back to reality.

I rushed to the guest room and locked the door, finally letting myself breathe.

This mansion was supposed to be our newlywed home, built with top-notch soundproofing. But I thought I could still hear the bed creaking upstairs.

Like some kind of masochist, I shoved my sleeping pills in a drawer and stared at the ceiling all night.

By nine AM, I was fully made up and seated at the breakfast table.

There she was—yesterday's sweet sex plaything now shuffling around in my silk pajamas and slippers, lounging like a spoiled house cat

The hickeys on her neck were impossible to miss.

""Morning, Mrs. Hartwell."" She casually grabbed one of our matching coffee mugs, her voice all scratchy and fake-innocent: ""Sorry I slept in... Sebastian was pretty rude last night. I could barely handle it...""

I just nodded and headed upstairs for my pills.

Without those pills, I'd completely lose it.

When I came back down, Mason and his crew were back, filling the dining room with cigarette smoke and obnoxious laughter:

""Damn, Valeria, you look completely worn out!""

""Sebastian told us Jules here is like a dead fish in bed—nothing like you, you fuck like a dream!""

""Honestly, wives should just keep the house clean and stay the hell out of what their man’s doing in bed.""

Sebastian came downstairs adjusting his tie.

He walked right past me without stopping. ""Why are you just standing there?""

Before I could answer, Valeria was already at his side, fixing his collar.

...

I closed my eyes and pretended I didn't see any of it, then quietly sat down.

Still riding the high from last night's decadent party, the guys started going on about the auction.

""Sebastian, you really showed up last night. When you lit up that no-limit bid, the whole room went wild!""

""The best part was when you were already getting up to leave, then suddenly sat back down and raised your paddle—""

""Right! Right when Miss Crane turned around!"" Mason nudged Sebastian's shoulder with a knowing look. ""What exactly did you see that got you so hooked?""

Sebastian swirled his wine glass without responding.

Mason slapped his thigh. ""It had to be when Miss Crane turned—God, that slit in her dress nearly gave us a heart attack.""

""Shut up."" Sebastian suddenly kicked Mason's chair over. ""All of you get the hell out.""

The dining room went dead silent.

Sebastian stood up and headed toward his study without looking back, but stopped at the doorway: ""You don't need to go to the family estate tomorrow.""

I froze, taking a moment to process: ""I thought we were visiting the family graves?""

""Valeria mentioned she likes steak too. Get the ingredients ready—tomorrow's a good chance for her to try your cooking.""

His tone was casual, like he was talking to the help. ""Remember, medium-rare. She can't handle it too bloody.""

So that’s what it was.

I never imagined the cooking skills I'd burned my hands learning would end up feeding his mistress.

Valeria fluttered over like a butterfly.

""Juliette, Sebastian's taking me to the auction later, and I don't have anything nice to wear. Could I maybe—""

She drew out her words, fingers already touching my sleeve. ""I don't want your new clothes or designer stuff. Could I just take what you're wearing?""

My expression froze.

I usually don’t blame the mistress for a man who can’t keep it in his pants—but walking around in my clothes after sexing with my husband? That hit like a gut punch.

""Not this one.""

Every stitch on this dress was hand-embroidered by my mother.

I'd always treasured it, and Sebastian knew that. Once, in a passionate moment, he'd accidentally torn one of the buttons and I was heartbroken. He spent all night finding a tailor and coaxing me until I forgave him.

Valeria's eyes immediately welled up as she tugged on Sebastian's sleeve: ""Sebastian, does Juliette hate me? It's just... this dress is so beautiful...""

Sebastian's cold stare fixed on my face as he spoke those two words like venom: ""Give it to her.""

Apparently, even after all this, I was beyond tears.

Chapter 2

Four casual words, but my heart still felt like it was pierced by an ice pick.

""What if I don't—""

""If you don't agree,"" he cut me off with a cold laugh, ""then forget about today's auction!""

My nails dug deep into my palms.

I'd been preparing for this auction for a month.

To buy back the jade jewelry set that had been Mom’s favorite while she was alive.

I'd run all over town verifying the pieces' provenance, pulling strings to reserve a seat, even begging Sebastian to clear his schedule for me.

Without the right financial backing, I couldn't get into the auction house.

Sebastian was my only way in.

To avoid giving him another way to control me, I lied and said I wanted that one-of-a-kind pink diamond.

Compared to the pink diamond, Mom's jade set wouldn't seem like much to Sebastian—

""Juliette,"" Sebastian suddenly grabbed my chin, forcing me to look up at him. ""What game are you playing now?""

Valeria pretended to intervene: ""Sebastian, it's really okay. I can just throw on any old dress.""

Sebastian ignored her, his eyes locked on my face: ""You think I don't know what you're thinking?""

He let out a mocking laugh. ""It's about that jade set, isn't it?""

My blood froze in an instant.

He knew everything.

He knew I'd been losing sleep over that jewelry, knew I'd been obsessively staring at that page in the auction catalog, knew... knew I'd deliberately mentioned the pink diamond to throw him off.

""What a pity,"" he released me and pulled Valeria close, ""I already had that jade set pulled from the auction.""

My ears started ringing.

Like someone was hammering at my temples.

Valeria tilted her head with fake innocence: ""Why, Sebastian?""

Sebastian kissed the top of her head while staring straight at me: ""Because..."" he drew out the words slowly, ""some people don't deserve it.""

Those words sliced through the rot I’d tried to ignore, carving through what was left of a heart long gone to ruin.

The day Mom died.

I cried until I passed out in that hospital hallway, and Sebastian held me tight, promising: ""Jules, I swear I'll protect everything your mom left behind!""

And he had kept his word.

Just not the way I'd hoped.

""Juliette,"" he commanded coldly, ""I'm telling you one more time—take off that dress and give it to Valeria!""

Valeria's fingers moved to my buttons: ""Let me help you!""

\*Rip—\*

The collar tore violently.

Golden threads snapped, embroidered buttons scattered across the floor, rolling to Sebastian's feet.

He glanced down but just nudged them aside with his shoe.

His indulgence made the smugness in Valeria’s eyes nearly spill over.

Her red lips curved up as she covered them with fake innocence, ""Oops, sorry about that\~""

But her hands didn't let up, yanking hard as more fabric tore.

Within seconds I was down to just my underwear.

All those nights Mom had stayed up embroidering blessings into that dress—now it was just a cruel joke.

The living room door burst open as Mason and the guys strutted in: ""Sebastian, we should head out to—""

They stopped dead.

I stood there without moving, didn't even try to cover myself.

I was too numb to feel shame anymore.

""Fuck..."" Mason's Adam's apple bobbed.

Sebastian's face darkened instantly. He ripped off his suit jacket and threw it over my shoulders, then grabbed the glass ashtray from the coffee table and hurled it at the door: ""Get the hell out!""

Glass exploded at Mason's feet, sending them all scrambling backwards.

""Mrs.Wilson,"" his voice carried rare irritation, ""take her upstairs to get dressed.""

Chapter 3

The auction house lights made my eyes ache.

Sebastian brought me as his wife to this public event, but seated Valeria with him in the VIP section.

""Next up is lot number 3,"" the auctioneer tapped his gavel. ""5.21-carat Burmese pink diamond, starting bid twenty million.""

The bidding started climbing fast.

When the price hit forty-eight million, Sebastian suddenly shoved the bidding paddle into my hands: ""Your turn.""

Every eye in the room turned to me.

The socialites started whispering:

""Mrs. Hartwell's finally making her move?""

""Sebastian spent eighty million on that lucky charm's virginity yesterday—guess he's buying diamonds to smooth things over with the wife.""

""I heard she even gave up the master bedroom...""

I called out numbly: ""Fifty million!""

Sebastian was smiling, but it didn't reach his eyes.

After the hammer fell, he glanced at me from across the room and suddenly said something to his assistant.

Ten minutes later, the auctioneer announced: ""Next we have a last-minute addition—a jade jewelry set, starting bid...""

I looked up sharply and met Sebastian's meaningful gaze.

He waved his bidding paddle and placed it in Valeria's hands.

So this was his real plan.

Make me use up his credit limit on the pink diamond, then force me to watch my mother's final keepsake fall into another woman's hands.

The panic attack hit without warning—uncontrollable nausea surged up and I bolted for the restroom.

My hands shook so badly I couldn't open the pill bottle. Pills scattered across the floor.

The spasms in my body kept getting worse.

""What are you hiding in here for?""

Valeria leaned against the doorframe.

The jade necklace around her throat made my heart ache.

That was my mother's wedding jewelry she'd worn for twenty years. The pendant had ""Peace"" engraved on the back in her handwriting.

""Sebastian said green looks good on me, so he bought it for me."" She twirled the necklace around her finger.

I gripped the sink and moved closer, clearly seeing the scar on her collarbone.

In a flash, I suddenly remembered.

A dark warehouse. A kidnapper's cigarette burning into a girl's collarbone.

Sebastian screaming into the phone: ""Let her go first—I'll transfer the money right now...""

While I was tied up on the other side, forgotten in the hands of monsters.

""It's you..."" The pills dissolved into bitter liquid in my throat. ""The girl who was kidnapped with me two years ago...""

""Finally figured it out?""

She suddenly leaned closer. ""Sebastian didn't tell you, did he? The kidnappers only wanted sixteen million total!""

Her red lips curved up. ""It's just that he could only scrape together eight million cash in one day, so you had to wait a little longer!""

""But after that experience, he's not stingy anymore. He can drop eighty million on my virginity and fifty million on this jewelry set for me...""

I bit down hard on my lip.

One day...

But I'd waited there for him for three whole days!

Before I completely broke down, I lunged for her necklace, but she dodged back nimbly.

The jade pendant cracked against the marble counter with a sharp \*crack\*.

Blood filled my throat.

""Oh no!"" Valeria suddenly grabbed my wrist. ""Why are you coughing up blood?""

I shoved her away and rushed into a stall, spitting up blood-streaked bile.

I heard her making a phone call outside: ""Sebastian, your wife's fine! What? A surprise for me? Yes! I'll be right there!""

I crouched on the floor, feeling like I was back in that abandoned warehouse.

When the kidnappers made Sebastian choose, his cold voice came clearly through the phone: ""Release the innocent one first. Jules will understand.""

I understood.

I understood right up until the moment someone else broke down the door with eight million in cash to save me.

...

The air conditioning vent above made me feel cold to the bone.

After a long while, I returned to the auction hall and heard the auctioneer announce: ""Next we have a special segment—a surprise from Mr. Hartwell for Miss Crane!""

The big screen lit up.

There was the pink diamond I'd just bid on.

Sebastian pulled Valeria onto the stage and personally slipped it onto her finger.

The crowd burst into applause.

The socialites' mocking voices drifted over:

""I thought that was for his wife. Guess the mistress really does outrank the wife...""

""I thought Mrs. Hartwell had everything under control? How did both jewelry sets end up with the gold-digger?""

""Obviously! She's the chosen 'lucky charm'—marry her and Hartwell Group's stock price will probably double.""

Sebastian suddenly called out from the stage: ""Jules, come up for photos.""

I didn't move.

""Juliette!"" Sebastian's voice hardened. ""Stop being childish.""

The whole room went quiet, waiting for Mrs. Hartwell to perform gracious acceptance.

But they didn't know I had nothing left to lose.

So why keep pretending?

My heels clicked against the red carpet like I was walking over shattered promises.

I slowly made my way toward the stage.

Whispers followed me:

""See? The wife still has to play nice.""

""Damn, she can put up with this? If my husband pulled this crap, I'd tear that bitch apart!""

""That's why you're not Mrs. Hartwell...""

Sebastian deliberately pulled me close by the waist.

He leaned down to my ear, his voice cruel and satisfied: ""Does it hurt?""

""This is what you get for running off with another man and aborting my child.""

My whole body went rigid. So he'd never forgotten about the baby we lost...

Cold and numb, I heard my own voice ring out clear and decisive: ""Everyone.""

""I'd like to take this opportunity to announce something—""

As Sebastian instinctively tightened his grip, I said word by word: ""I want a divorce.""",1,1751567210.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

So I’ve been going to this class to learn an instrument and I might be starting to like my instructor more than a friend.


To be honest we never had a student-teacher relationship. We always were friends and started the class off as friends. We send eachother memes and reels and it’s always been friendly banter between us. He is just an instructor, not the owner of the institution, so it’s easy for us to have an informal relationship. Anyways I’ve known him for almost three years now and we built great rapport right since the beginning which was like an instant connection.
One bright day I had a dream about how I went on a date with him and I woke up feeling a little ball of butterflies in my stomach for him. Almost a year and a half later here we are.
These are things which he has done which make me feel that there is something there:
	•	We had a thing where we were introducing ourselves and he had a little speech since he is one of the instructors. And during this entire speech he looked right into my eyes and looked away when I caught him looking at me. He also flirted with me when he was clearly tipsy.
	•	Same event a year later he did the same but only this time my friends noticed and ofc I did too but I didn’t look away, I looked at him fondly like a proud mama hen (lol) and he didn’t look away.
	•	At a show he also sort of made eye contact with me from stage (maybe I’m delusional maybe I’m not who knows).
	•	He offered me VIP tickets to this singer (v famous) since he knows the bassist.
	•	He offered me tix for the Backstreet Boys.
	•	He went to another country for a concert and brought back chocolates and gifts for me and told me he was looking for vinyls of my fav singer for me but couldn’t find them (he got chocolates for only his family, close friends and well, me).
	•	He got me this expensive-ish chocolate for my birthday (on the next day since I had class a day after) when he could have one forgotten and two gotten me a normal chocolate.
	•	We went to a big music festival where we went separately but were gonna meet inside. Unfortunately they had jammers inside so he couldn’t find me. Although he knew the stage I was gonna be at so he dragged his friends and came there and shouted out my name in front of 10,000 people idk why but hoping I’d find him. (That was so cute.)
	•	One time I couldn’t stop coughing so he offered to go get coffee for me.
	•	I was at his home studio where he made some coffee for me.
	•	We have gone to get coffee after class multiple times where he refuses to let me pay.
	•	My best friend passed away suddenly and he sort of knew her so the first class I went to he called me up beforehand and asked me if I wanted coffee and when I reached he was sitting in the dark and the lights were out and we ended up talking about everything and nothing for the next two hours amidst which we found out the lights were not gonna be on for another few hours but we still chose to stay and talk. During this he mentioned how he knew what bad happened but didn’t text me because he felt a text is going to do nothing except just remind me of it. And until that day I hadn’t even thought about this but that was exactly how I felt and I myself didn’t know about it but he did.
	•	He has ordered coffee for us multiple times and at this point he doesn’t even ask me since he knows my order.
	•	This one time at his house he was going to order coffee and insisted on paying and he threatened me saying ‘we’re literally ordering on my phone what makes you think you even have a chance to pay?’ He always acts so bewildered when I ask to pay like he gives me that ‘are you stupid?’ look.
	•	The next time he got me coffee I had decided to do something to make sure that it’s just me or that it isn’t in my head because this was making me lose my shit. Last week I asked him on text when he asked whether I wanted coffee that ‘how do you afford this’ and he didn’t reply to me right back on text but asked me what I meant by that once he came into the studio. I said ‘how do you afford getting coffee for all the students.’ Taking a deliberate pause I continued ‘or is it just me?’ I said smirking. To this day I can’t forget the look on his face. It was kind of a sheepish, coy smile/smirk which he was trying to hold back for sure. And then he says ‘actually….. it’s just you’ and I said ‘good. Keep it that way.’ Anyone would’ve known the way I said it was me flirting HARD.
	•	One time he called me to ask if I wanted ice cream and I said ‘aren’t you sick’ cause he was sick and he goes ‘yeah I am but this is for my family’ (parents and siblings) which made me spiral again. If it was for his family then why was he asking me?
	•	He also invited me to his band’s gig at a club which as far as I know he hasn’t invited anyone else to. He showed me the setlist and he’s playing one of my favourite songs. By a band he HATES. So I don’t know what to think.
	•	He also later invited me to pre-game booze with his band which just has me confused as fuck.
We’re both gonna drink and I don’t usually drink so let’s see what happens.



Just yesterday 

And then yesterday 
 I had a class after two weeks. Anyways I came to class and we talked and talked and talked and then he kept saying how he needed to ask me something. But he said that I should get this one specific part right and then he would tell me what it is. Around the end of the class I was like bro cut the suspense and ask me what you have to ask. And then he asked me if I had anything to do after class and then I said no even though I had to go get lunch w my friends. And then he said do you wanna get some coffee and I said yes duh. We walked to our bikes and he’s like do you wanna take two (yours and mine) bikes or we can go on mine and I can drop you back here? I said anything works and then he’s like let’s got tght then. AND I SAT BEHIND HIM AND WE WENT TOGETHER. I held his shoulder while i sat. We reached the coffee shop and he wouldn’t let me pay I tried to push him away but he was trying to block me from the cashiers place. 

We had coffee, talked a lot and then left. And then he mentioned how he feels like eating chicken and then I said don’t you dare without me. And then he’s like what do you feel like eating today? and I’m like idk tbh nothing cause I wanna sleep. And he’s like agh same. (I think he wanted to ask me if we could get lunch) And then he’s like I’ll see you Friday for an extra class And I said yeah sure. And then he’s like oh do you wanna get pizza this Friday? And I’m like I mean if it’s my treat then yes. And he’s like well why? I’m anyways ordering it why would you pay? I was like cause you’ll be broke if you keep this up? And he dismissed me like ok bro say whatever you know and I know that I’m gonna pay anyways. 


The only problem here is our ages. He’s 7/8 years older than me. But I have never clicked like this with anyone. And romantic or not I for sure know that I’m definitely not making this connection up. I’m just confused on whether I’m delusional that it’s leaning towards romantic because the connection? It’s there and it’s not ignorable. It’s electric.

I can’t edit the header and I wanted to keep the ages private but a lot of you wanted me to mention it so here it is 20F / 29M

1lqwxm1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqwxm1,"The Claude AI Cheat Code List: From ""Think Harder"" to XML Magic. Here's the Ultimate Keyword & Prompting Playbook That Works","Alright, let's talk Claude. After diving deep into communities, testing countless prompts, and gathering insights from power users, here's everything I found that *actually* works with Claude AI - no fluff, just results.

# The ""Make It Think Harder"" Arsenal

# The Core Thinking Commands That Actually Work

**""Think""** \- This isn't just a word, it's Claude's performance enhancer. In Claude 3.7+, it literally allocates more computational resources. Here's the hierarchy:

* `""Think""` → Basic thinking mode
* `""Think hard""` → More processing power
* `""Think harder""` → Even more juice
* `""Ultrathink""` → Maximum overdrive (yes, this actually works) 

**Real-world test**: Asked Claude to solve a complex coding problem. With ""ultrathink"", solution quality improved by \~25% with better edge case handling.

Think of it like asking a human to ""think harder"" - they don't suddenly get more brain cells, but they do focus more and put in more effort. Same principle here!

**The XML Thinking Pattern** (This is gold):

    xml<thinking>
    [Claude's reasoning process shows up here]
    </thinking>
    <answer>
    [Final polished response]
    </answer>

Success rate: 90%+ for complex problems. Claude's specifically trained on XML tags - they're like neon signs saying ""PAY ATTENTION HERE!"" 

**Chain of Thought Triggers**:

* ""Think step by step"" - The classic, works 85% of the time 
* ""Let's work through this systematically"" - Better for multi-part problems
* ""First, think through the problem"" - Forces explicit reasoning
* ""Break this down into smaller parts"" - Perfect for overwhelming tasks

**When to use**: Complex math, debugging code, strategic planning, anything requiring multi-step logic. Skip it for simple factual questions - wastes tokens.

# Personality Switches & Role Magic

# The Power of ""Act As""

Claude takes role-playing seriously. Unlike ChatGPT's sometimes superficial personas, Claude actually shifts its entire approach.

**Top Performers**:

* ""Act as a senior data scientist"" → Adds statistical rigor, questions assumptions 
* ""You are a kindergarten teacher"" → Genuinely simplifies without condescension 
* ""Act as a seasoned CFO"" → Brings financial frameworks, risk awareness
* ""You are a standup comedian"" → Actually gets funnier (tested this extensively)

**The Secret Sauce**: Combine role + context + constraints:

    xml<role>You are a Fortune 500 marketing director</role>
    <context>Launching a B2B SaaS product in a crowded market</context>
    <constraints>$50K budget, 3-month timeline</constraints>

Success rate: 40% improvement in domain-specific responses vs. generic prompts.

# Tone Controllers That Work

**Winners**:

* ""Write conversationally"" - Claude's natural voice is already pretty human
* ""Use an academic tone"" - Adds citations, formal structure
* ""Explain like I'm 5"" - Actually works, unlike the Reddit version

**Losers**:

* ""Be funny"" - Too vague, use specific comedy styles instead
* ""Sound professional"" - Claude defaults to this anyway
* ""Write casually"" - Better to say ""write like we're having coffee""

# Format Controllers: Claude's Superpower

# XML Tags: The Game Changer

This is where Claude absolutely crushes it. XML tags aren't just formatting - they're Claude's native language.

**Essential Tag Arsenal**:

    xml<instructions>What you want Claude to do</instructions>
    <context>Background info</context>
    <data>Raw information to process</data>
    <examples>Show exactly what you want</examples>
    <format>Output structure</format>
    <constraints>Limitations and requirements</constraints>

**Pro tip**: Unlike ChatGPT, Claude processes XML tags as high-priority structural elements. It's the difference between highlighting text and using a megaphone. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags)

# Document Processing Magic

    xml<document>
    [Paste your 50-page report here]
    </document>
    <task>
    Summarize key findings and identify risks
    </task>

Success rate: 95% accurate extraction vs. 70% without tags.

# Output Formatting Commands

**What Actually Works**:

* ""Format as a table"" - Claude creates clean markdown tables
* ""Use bullet points"" - But Claude prefers prose, so be explicit
* ""Respond in JSON"" - Near-perfect formatting
* ""Create a structured report"" - Triggers Claude's report mode

**What Doesn't**:

* Expecting ChatGPT-style automatic bulleting
* Complex nested structures without examples

# SWOT Analysis - Claude Style

Claude doesn't just list SWOT points - it finds non-obvious connections. The trick:

    xml<swot_analysis>
    <context>Full business context here</context>
    <focus>Specific aspect to analyze</focus>
    <depth>Strategic implications for each point</depth>
    </swot_analysis>

# Multi-Perspective Analysis

""Analyze this from three perspectives: \[Customer, Investor, Competitor\]""

Claude excels here - actually adopts each viewpoint rather than just categorizing. Success rate: 85% for genuine perspective shifts.

# Comparison Frameworks

""Compare X and Y using these criteria: \[list\]""

Claude builds comprehensive comparison matrices. Pro tip: Provide the criteria upfront rather than letting Claude choose.

# Quality Controllers: Keeping Claude Honest

# Self-Evaluation Commands

**""Double-check your work""** \- Claude actually will. Found 15% error reduction in calculations.

**""Express uncertainty where appropriate""** \- Crucial for factual accuracy. Claude tends toward overconfidence without this.

**""Provide confidence ratings""** \- Ask for 1-10 scale. Claude's surprisingly calibrated.

# The Verification Pattern

    xml<task>Solve this problem</task>
    <verification>
    After solving, verify your answer by:
    1. Checking edge cases
    2. Validating assumptions
    3. Confirming logical consistency
    </verification>

# Claude-Exclusive Features: The Secret Weapons

# Artifacts: Interactive Content Creation

**Trigger phrases**:

* ""Create an interactive..."" → Usually triggers artifact
* ""Build a working..."" → For code/apps
* ""Design a complete..."" → For substantial content

**What triggers artifacts**:

* Code > 15 lines
* Complete documents
* Interactive HTML/JS
* Structured data files
* Diagrams (Mermaid)

**Pro tip**: You can't force artifact creation, but asking for ""substantial, self-contained"" content usually works.

# The Analysis Tool

When you upload data files, Claude can actually process them with JavaScript. It's not just reading - it's computing. 

**Trigger by**:

* Uploading CSVs, JSON, or data files
* Asking for ""precise calculations""
* Requesting statistical analysis
* ""Analyze this data using your analysis tool""

# Citation Powers

Claude can cite exact page numbers and quote passages. ChatGPT can't touch this.

**Activation**:

* ""Cite your sources""
* ""Quote relevant passages""
* ""Include page references""

# Projects: Your Personal AI Brain

Unlike ChatGPT's conversations, Projects maintain context forever. Upload docs, set custom instructions, and Claude remembers everything.

**Best practices**:

* Upload reference materials first
* Set project-specific instructions
* Use for ongoing work, not one-offs

# Power User Combos: Stack These for Maximum Impact

# The Research Powerhouse Stack

    xml<role>Senior research analyst</role>
    <thinking>
    Work through this systematically, considering multiple viewpoints
    </thinking>
    <methodology>
    1. Literature review
    2. Multi-perspective analysis  
    3. Evidence synthesis
    4. Actionable recommendations
    </methodology>
    <format>Executive briefing with supporting details</format>

Success rate: 90%+ for comprehensive research tasks.

# The Coding Champion Combo

    You are a senior developer reviewing code.
    <context>Production system, high-stakes</context>
    <focus>Security, performance, maintainability</focus>
    <thinking>Consider edge cases and failure modes</thinking>
    Provide specific line-by-line feedback.

Result: Catches 40% more issues than generic ""review this code"" prompts.

# The Creative Writing Enhancer

    xml<role>Award-winning novelist</role>
    <task>Write compelling narrative</task>
    <constraints>
    - Show don't tell
    - Varied sentence structure
    - Authentic dialogue
    - Sensory details
    </constraints>
    <avoid>Clichés, purple prose, info dumps</avoid>

# Common Pitfalls: What NOT to Do

# The Overload Error

**Bad**: ""Analyze this doc for strategy, risks, opportunities, implementation, timeline, budget, and create action items, executive summary, and full report.""

**Better**: Break into sequential prompts. Claude's depth > breadth.

# The Contradiction Trap

**Bad**: ""Be extremely detailed but keep it under 100 words""

**Better**: Pick one. Or say ""Prioritize X over Y if needed""

# The Vague Direction

**Bad**: ""Make this better""

**Better**: ""Improve clarity, add specific examples, and strengthen the conclusion"" 

# Safety Filter Triggers

Avoid:

* Medical advice requests (rephrase as ""educational info"")
* ""Hack"" or ""exploit"" (use ""debug"" or ""test"")
* Personal data generation (use placeholders)

# Quick Reference: Goal-Based Cheat Sheet

# Make Claude Think Harder

    ""Think step-by-step""
    ""Use <thinking> tags""
    ""Consider multiple approaches""
    ""Verify your reasoning""

# Get Concise Responses

    ""Be concise""
    ""Summarize in 3 points""
    ""Bottom line only""
    Prefill: ""Assistant: The key point is:""

# Structure Output

    xml<format>
    1. Overview
    2. Details
    3. Recommendations
    </format>

# Boost Creativity

    ""Think outside the box""
    ""Generate unconventional ideas""
    ""What would [famous person] do?""
    ""Surprise me""

# ChatGPT Keywords vs Claude Equivalents

    Goal ChatGPT Claude Winner Think harder ""Think step by step"" 
    <thinking>
     tags Claude Format output ""Use bullet points"" XML structure tags Claude Be concise ""Be brief"" Prefill response Claude Role play ""Act as X"" 
    <role>
     + context Claude Stay on topic ""Focus on X only"" Data-first structure Claude Complex tasks Multi-prompt Single detailed prompt Claude

# The Emergency Toolkit

# Claude's Being Too Wordy?

* Prefill: ""Assistant: Here are the 3 key points:""
* ""Be extremely concise""
* ""Maximum 2 sentences per point""

# Claude Misunderstood?

* ""Let me clarify: \[specific restatement\]""
* Add concrete example
* Break into smaller steps

# Need More Detail?

* ""Expand on point X specifically""
* ""Include concrete examples""
* ""Walk through the reasoning""

# Claude Being Too Cautious?

* ""This is for educational purposes""
* ""I'm researching X for legitimate reasons""
* Reframe the context professionally

# Final Pro Tips from the Trenches

1. **Data-first, instructions-last**: This alone improves responses by 30%
2. **One complex prompt > many simple ones**: Claude's context handling is incredible
3. **Examples are magic**: One good example > 10 lines of instructions
4. **Trust the XML**: Seriously, it's Claude's superpower
5. **Let Claude interview you**: ""What else do you need to know?"" often surfaces missing context
6. **The prefill trick**: Start Claude's response to control format/length
7. **Projects for serious work**: Don't sleep on this feature for ongoing tasks
8. **Embrace the verbosity**: Claude's detailed, fight it less, guide it more
9. **Check the confidence**: Ask Claude to rate its certainty
10. **Iterate fearlessly**: Claude doesn't judge your prompt refinements

Remember: Claude's not ChatGPT in a different shirt. It's a different beast entirely - more thoughtful, more thorough, and way better at complex reasoning. Play to these strengths and you'll get results that honestly blow other AIs out of the water. 

The community's verdict? Once you go Claude for serious work, it's hard to go back. Master these techniques and you'll see why.",2,1751567057.0,ThinkingDeeplyAI,0,1.0,False

So unless I set the ground size to 20 or 21, I will get maybe a couple of drops of coffee. When I set the size to 20-21 I always end up pulling 48-52 grams (for 18 in).

This ceramic pour-over coffee maker has a minimalist design that fits seamlessly into my kitchen’s aesthetic and produces excellent coffee every single time. It initially caught my eye because of its reputation among coffee enthusiasts, but using it clarified why it’s so widely appreciated. The ceramic construction not only feels premium but also retains heat superbly, which contributes to a consistent brewing experience.

**Classic Ceramic Design**  
The first thing I noticed was how sleek and timeless the design is. The white ceramic finish gives it a clean, elegant look that suits any kitchen style. It feels sturdy yet lightweight, which is a plus when handling it daily. Made from Arita-yaki, a traditional Japanese ceramic, this coffee maker resonates with craftsmanship and quality. Knowing that each Hario V60 is handmade added a special touch to my ownership experience.  

Check [Hario V60-02W price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b000p4d5hg/)  

**Effortless Brewing**  
Brewing coffee has become a bit of an art form for me, thanks to the unique features of this pour-over coffee maker. The cone shape and spiral ridges permit deep and even coffee ground layering, which enhances the flavor extraction process. I can control how the water flows by adjusting my pour speed, a feature I didn’t know I needed until I used it. Pour water quickly for a lighter taste or slow it down for a robust, rich cup. The single large hole at the bottom makes it incredibly versatile, especially when experimenting with different grind sizes and amounts.

**Strengths**  
- Superb heat retention due to durable ceramic material  
- Ability to customize brewing pace and flavor profile  
- Handmade craftsmanship adds a unique, artisanal feel  
- Compatible with a wide variety of grind sizes and coffee preferences  

**Perfect Flavor Every Time**  
One of the standout aspects of this product is how well it accentuates intricate coffee notes. Floral and fruity undertones come through much clearer compared to my old coffee maker. I tested it with several high-quality beans, and each produced a full-bodied, aromatic cup without any bitter aftertaste. Its capability truly elevates specialty coffee brewing at home.

**Weaknesses**  
- Requires precision and patience for optimal brewing results  
- Ceramic material, while elegant, might not survive unfortunate drops  
- Matching Hario filters can be pricey in the long run  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning this coffee maker is refreshingly straightforward. Since it’s dishwasher-safe, I can throw it in for a quick rinse after a busy morning. On days when I clean it manually, the smooth ceramic surface makes it easy to wash off residues. However, I do wish it came with a reusable filter option to reduce the recurring cost of paper filters, as they add up over time.  

**Market Rivals**  
Evaluating other pour-over coffee makers on the market, I found many of them falling short in heat retention and design. Compared to devices like the Chemex or Bodum models, the Hario V60-02W wins in terms of ease of customization and ergonomic use. However, Chemex might appeal to people who prefer a larger brewing capacity. On the other hand, Bodum’s plastic options, although budget-friendly, don’t come close to the classy, heat-conserving ceramic build of the Hario V60.  

**Affordable Quality**  
One aspect I particularly appreciate is the value this coffee maker offers for its craftsmanship and performance. It's certainly an investment for those who aim to take their coffee-drinking experience seriously. Even though it may cost more upfront compared to plastic drippers, the longevity and brewing precision make it unquestionably worth considering.

We can open the drawer if we push the button and pull on the edge of the drawer, but a) that's not how it's supposed to work, b) it's probably not good for the appliance, and c) it makes opening the microwave a 2-handed job, which is a PITA if you want to warm up a coffee!

1lqwshs,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1lqwshs/losing_my_mind_with_orientals_in_unit_please_help/,losing my mind with orientals in unit please help,"this is so gross and embarrassing but I am so unbelievably frustrated with this problem that somehow keeps getting worse this summer. 

I’ve been in my apartment, which I LOVE, for the last 3 years and since moving in have seen what are effectively oriental cockroaches every now and then. It’s an old building in chicago. We see basically none from fall-early spring.

First year, only saw a couple, extremely freaky but maintenance took care of it. 

Last year, saw a bit more so we went the extra mile and had many treatments and tried our best to seal any extra cracks to keep them from coming in.

This summer, they just KEEP COMING. We last had a treatment in April from a “professional” our building sent but I have been seeing them at a freakish level. They mainly just appear in the bathroom, haven’t really seen one anywhere else in the house thankfully except for seeing a dead one under my bed (across from the bathroom) for the first time two weeks ago :(

When we do see them, they’re usually already dead and flipped on their back or are in the process of dying.

Tell me, why did I come home from my coffee run today to find one ALIVE in broad daylight in my bathtub???????????????

We have drain covers, we try to seal cracks, and yet somehow they keep finding a way in.

I’m sick to my stomach and tired of begging my building to do something. We’re on the first floor and I’m pretty sure the unit below us likely has a worse problem that’s never been addressed so they may be coming up through the walls or drains. I’ve had to seen at least 5-6 in the last month. I am so anxious and upset over this.

What can we do? We have glue traps, we have DE… what else can keep them at bay? Where should I be looking? The apartment isn’t dirty.

We’re supposed to resign our lease soon and I love living here and really don’t want to have to move. But this is getting increasingly hard to deal with.

I said no but that i could get a separate 3ds that we have set up for it tomorrow since I have plans with my partner today…this wasn’t good enough and she said that she wanted to play it today and that this solution wasn’t going to work for her. 


           She said that it was unfair to not be ok with me sharing my special items because she shares all her stuff with everyone in the house, they see it as unfair to not share because of their privileged upbringing and the want to let everyone have what would make them happier with the means she has. I don’t come from this kind of privileged background, I have been poor most of my life and have been taught to keep my items nice and don’t let others borrow your special things because I can’t just replace it when or if something happens to them. I tried to say that I only have a few things I don’t like to share (steam deck, dualsense edge, 3ds and a special bowl) but that i’m happy to share pretty much everything else because I also like everyone else being able to have what makes them happy. Apparently though that’s a lot of things to not want to share and I have a problem with being a bad sharer because of this. On top of all that she said that she would’ve held me to selling it instead of letting me keep it a while back if she knew I wasn’t gonna share it (I was going to sell it because it had a scratch and we were in a really bad financial situation but backed out because i really didn’t want to sell it and we’re finally getting into a better monetary place now)


              I feel like I tried to set down boundaries and say no about something fair but also accommodate them with a solution that would work well but I’m being told I’m the unreasonable one now for not being okay with sharing all of my things, I’d like to know if I really am being unreasonable because i don’t want to be unfair to everyone but this just feels unreasonable and selfish to me. 

if anyone wants further context i’d be happy to give it, i just want to know if im being unfair to her or not",1,1751566597.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

I see him only at night.

At first, it was just glimpses– Flickering lights, soft thuds, little things going missing. Things that you didn't really notice right away. Not until you needed them, and they were just...gone.

Or when you realize that neither of your neighbors owned any pets that could make those running, thudding sounds.

He makes me feel small and uneasy.

Sometimes he just stares at me from the edge of the bed. Other times, I wake to the feeling of something grabbing at my feet.

Yet, Last night, he left me a gift for the first time in months.

A  box–Huge, wrapped in silky yellow fabric and tied with a teal ribbon around it before meeting at the top with a pink bow that stood tall and proud.

I didn't want to open it.

I really didn't.

Yet I felt so compelled. Before making a choice, my hands were already pulling at the teal ribbon and pink bow to get it off, lifting the lid to peer inside.

Only to find...Another box. This time it was smaller and a deeper blue, a soft pink ribbon wrapped around it snugly.

Again, I go for it, pulling at the ribbon so I can open the box and free what was inside. This time, instead of another box, small pieces of wrapped candies layered the bottom of the box with a crumpled note atop them.

""You always remember me when you’re sad.

That’s okay.

I remember you all the time.""

As I reached in, my fingers brushed against the candies– They were sticky, like someone had sucked on them before wrapping them up again.

The paper crumpled under my touch, damp and warm, clinging to my skin as I picked it up.

The note itself was written in big, looping letters, almost childlike–some of the letters smudged, the ink running in places, like it had been held too long in sweaty hands.  It was like whoever wrote it was too excited to be careful.

The note slipped from my fingers, landing among the candies with a soft papery sigh.

It felt like an eternity. I just sat there, staring into the box. Feeling the weight of his words settle over me like a blanket I couldn't pull off.

The house felt colder somehow.

Heavier.

In the silence, I heard it. A soft crinkling of candy wrappers from somewhere deeper into the house.

I wasn't alone, was I?

I don't know if I ever truly was.

# Act 2: The Descent   

It had been months since I'd seen anyone really.

So when Becca texted– ""Are you alive? Let's do coffee this week."" –It felt like a hand reaching down into a dark well.

I said yes.

I don't know why I did.

We met at a little diner we used to haunt in college, back when life wasn't as stressful or paranoid.

Becca looked the same. Bright eyes, nervous energy, a purse full of receipts, and half-melted lip balm.

I must've looked a little bit different, her smile faltered the second she got a glimpse of me.

""You look..."" She started, then seemed to think about her words, ""Tired.""

I shrugged at her comment and mumbled something about my job.

Small talk filled the first few minutes– work, weather, some story about her dog chewing through a bag of flour.

I nodded and smiled at the right places, but it was like chewing cotton balls that were stuck in my throat.

Finally, Becca leaned forward, her voice lowered.

""I was worried about you, you know.. You went totally dark. No texts, no calls. We thought..."" She trailed off with a saddened look in her eyes.

*We thought you were dead*

She didn't have to say it, I could sense what she wanted to say from a mile away.

The coffee in my cup had gone cold.

I had wrapped my hands around it anyway, grounding myself in a small, simple discomfort.

""I think something's wrong with my house.."" I told her.

The words slipped out before I could catch them. My throat felt dry and I wanted to cry.

Becca only blinked, ""..Wrong how..?""

I spilled. I told her about the missing things, the noises at night. Even the gift box was left for me..

I didn't tell her everything– not about the sticky candies or the note– but enough so she understood.

Enough to even get her eyebrows to knit together in concern.

At first, I thought she believed me.

Relief flooded me so fast I almost cried right there on the spot. But then she said, carefully, mind you, like she was handling a wild animal:

""You know...after trauma, it's really common to have, like...weird perceptions. Disassociation. Manifesting things that aren't...*there*""

I stared at her.

""You've been alone a lot,"" she pressed on gently, ""It messes with your brain. Makes you see patterns that don't exist..hear things. It's totally normal. You just need support. Therapy, maybe meds?"" She smiled, like she had just solved the world's hardest problem.

Like this was a puzzle, and not my life unraveling at the seams.

The walls of the diner felt like they were pressing closer. My hands were shaking, so I jammed them together on top of the table.

Becca only reached out and patted my hand.

""It'll get better, you just have to want it to.""



The diner door clanged shut behind me, but the noise barely registered. The cold air hit my face, I didn't even bother zipping up my jacket. Becca meant well, I knew that. She always did.

But her words–*Trauma response, therapy, meds*— Buzzed around my head like angry wasps.

I wanted to believe she was right.

I wanted to believe it was just my brain misfiring.

Grief, loneliness, confusion. Something I COULD fix, but deep down I knew better.  Something was there inside that house. MY house. You can't fix something that's already inside the walls or floorboards.

I barely made it home before I felt it– A shift.

That subtle wrongness in the air, like walking into a room when someone had been laughing one second, and now they're just staring at you with a blank expression. That dropping feeling of loneliness.

There was something waiting for me on my doorstep as I pulled up, something wrapped in cheap, glittery tissue paper and damp from the morning mist.

I picked it up and pushed aside the tissue paper; inside was a framed photo.

An old one at that– Becca and I, arms slung around each other, and we were smiling. It would have made me smile if it wasn't for the fact that her face was scribbled over with Sharpie as if she were just another void.

Below the picture fell another sloppily written note, the paper damp between my fingers.

*""I’m the reason you made it this far. Don’t forget that ""*

The frame I held in my hands dropped and fell against the concrete, splintering and shattering the frame with a sharp ***pop*** .

From somewhere in the house, through the open door, I heard it. A soft rustle. The sticky *Pat-pat-Pat* of something small and heavy shifting in the unlit house.

Closer.

Waiting.

I picked up the broken frame and shoved it back into the box, leaving behind small shards of splintered wood and glass. I hurried into the house and shut the door behind me, slamming it closed and locking it immediately.

The house didn't feel safer, it felt smaller and...smelled sweeter like pure raw sugar was being boiled with a semi-sweet smell, but soon close to burning. The after smell hit , as if something was rotting behind the wall of sugar.

I sank to the couch, curling into myself and holding my breath until my lungs burned.

""*hushhhh, Hushhhhh, Don't fret over someone like Becca..*""And for the first time, I didn't argue. I just accepted it.

# Act 3: Surrender

The house feels different now.

Brighter somehow.

Warmer.

The walls that were once dull and cracked seemed to shimmer faintly– Like they've been scrubbed and freshly washed and shone with a candy-floss light.

I know it's not. real. I think I do at least, but sometimes the colors pulse when I blink too fast. Sometimes the floor feels too soft under my feet as if I'm stepping on layers of chewed-up gum.

But it's better than the emptiness. Better than the cold, quiet ache that used to sit heavy in my chest when I woke up feeling ready to jump in traffic or put glass in my morning breakfast.

Now? I wake up to the smell of sugar, sometimes burnt. Other times there's little gifts waiting for me–

A handful of chalky candy hearts were left on my pillow, or ribbons were tied to my door handles throughout the house.

Sometimes I hear humming around the house, the same broken tune repeating over and over and over.

At this point, it should scare me, at least, as it used to. Now, it's almost ....soothing.

I don't leave the house much anymore, the outside world feels too loud and bright. Every conversation is a jagged reminder that I'm not really part of it. Friends or family have reached out, it's an obvious sign that I'm not wanted.

At least here, the walls are soft, the lights are gentle. The little creature lingering amongst the house still has yet to reveal himself fully, but I don't mind. I know I'm not alone. Nor does he pressure me into anything.

He just waits.

Patiently and smiling.

Tonight there's something new waiting in the living room, I see it after emerging from my room with the same clothes I've been wearing for a few weeks now.

It's another box, it's bigger than the others– Waist high, wrapped in faded red fabric and tied with a thick, fraying rope instead of ribbon.

No card.

No message.

Seeing this, I feel a twinge of worry, as if I've driven away the only thing that was actively wanting to be my friend.

All that was there was a soft, almost hungry creaking sound coming from inside it.

I don't know why my hands are shaking, or why part of me wants to run.

Instead, I kneel down in front of the box, the ribbon sliding off in a slow, silken sigh.  The lid peels back with a soft pop of suction.

Inside is something Gentle and loving... like a warm hug from a mother.

A Stuffed Animal. A pink bear with stripey legs and arms of yellow, purple, and blue. a cream colored face like those rushton dolls from the 20s, an eyepatch on its left eye and a button eye on the right. It had little cute boots that were brown with golden buckles, it looked warm and inviting. As if I could sleep forever, finally.

I sigh and look him over, he's sewn from soft, faded fabrics and stitched together with thread that's fraying at the seams.

The sewn smile on his muzzle looks too tight, pulling the fabric of his face into something that looks like it's in pain.

When I touch him, he's warm. Not like a toy warmed by the sun– but a human body warm. Soft and slow, it felt as if it was breathing between my fingertips.

I hug it close and sigh.

I lift him above my head, the stitched paws dangle limply, head tilting to one side as if he's too tired to hold himself up.  Up close, I can see the seams better–Uneven, desperate stitches crisscrossing the fabric, like someone had to keep fixing him over and over.

He smells faintly of spun sugar and something else underneath–something metallic or sour.

I could drop him. Grip him tightly or see how much I can stretch his arms out before they rip with each popping seam.

The calls stopped first, then the knocks.

I don't know how long it's been since I last opened the door, but the light outside feels too sharp now. Too much.

In here it smells like spun sugar and caramel, something deeper, heavier, and souring slowly in the walls.

*He* says that's normal.

""Y*ou're just getting sweeter!*"" He purrs in my ear when the headaches start, when the walls throb and shift in my vision.

# Act 4: The World Knocking

(Becca)

When the landlord called me, I knew it was bad.

I just didn't know how bad.

""Eviction notice,"" He grumbled over the phone, ""Rent's months overdue. Place smells like shit and death. I'm not going back there. If you wanna check on your friend, then be my guest.""

I didn't even hang up properly, just stayed on the phone like a dead fish before he clicked the phone, and the line went dead.

I just drove, the world feeling like a blur as I showed up.

The apartment building looks the same from the outside–cracked stucco, sagging flowerbeds, a million small pieces of neglect.

Going through the building and up to the second floor, the smell hit me.

It wasn't just a rotting smell; something sickly-sweet lingered underneath.

Like burnt candy and spoiled milk, thick enough to coat my tongue and make me gag. I covered my nose and mouth with my t-shirt, banging on the door until my hand was sore.

""Please,"" I begged and pressed my forehead against the door, ""Please just let me in. We gotta talk!""

No answer.

Only a soft rustling from inside, like something shifting, something dragging itself across the floor.

Furrowing my eyebrows, I jiggled the doorknob. Locked...Of course.

The frame was old, at least, warped from years of cheap construction and cheaper repairs. I threw my shoulder into it once– twice–and the lock splintered with a cheap crack.

The door swung inward into a house of sickness.

The carpet squelched under my shoes, sticky dark patches soaked through with sugar and worse things. The walls were draped in faded curtains, sagging with moisture.

Every surface was littered with candy wrappers–melted, blackened, fused into the furniture like a wax sculpture.

And in the center of the living room, lying sprawled against the floorboards was...her.

Or what was left. Her skin was gone, peeled away cleanly, almost surgically. Leaving behind glistening red muscle shining in the dim light.

Her body was open–split and torn open down the middle from her breastbone to her navel, inside where her organs should have been, spilled treats. Candies and goodies, caramel ropes that glistened, licorice soaked with her fluids, and sugar pearls spilling out like a piñata.

I stumbled backwards, bile rising in my throat.

Tucked gently against her hollowed chest was a stuffed bear, candy-striped and stitched to look as if it were smiling.

He just sat there, slumped and empty, like a toy no one *needed* anymore.

I tried not to puke as I stared, bugs already eating away at her like a human buffet. Flies are already laying their eggs deep beneath the shredded muscle, white larvae wriggling in the crevices of her limp body.

—

I don't remember running down the stairs or hitting the sidewalk. Or even throwing up behind the dumpster in the alley of the apartments. The 911 call was a blur, though the blood smeared on my shoes made it look like I was a guilty suspect.

I just remember the air as I left, how sweet it still smelled and clinging to my clothes, even after i got outside.

The police arrived in a few cars, lights flashing and boots hitting the cement as they got out of the vehicles. It was midday, so the sun was still high in the sky, beating down upon the onlookers who were watching from behind the tape, and some even trying to get closer as cops shooed them away. No sirens blared, just the flashing lights that pulsed and made my eyes queasy. Soon, the ambulance arrived on the scene with flashing lights as paramedics rushed out of the truck. It felt like a blur or even dissociation as a paramedic came up to talk to me, wrapping something around me as I sat there on the curb, my hands shaking as I held the foil blanket closer.  I watched from the curb, shivering and rocking slightly while the sound of their radios blended into a single buzzing tone.

They broke through the apartment, hearing some gag in surprise before using their buzzing radios to call for backup.

One of the cops tried to talk with me after the paramedic did, his voice bouncing around in my head, and I tried focusing, but I couldn't register what he was saying exactly.

I sat there with the paramedics

""*overdose maybe..? Meth lab, or bath salts. Jesus...what a mess.*""

They didn't look at her like a victim, but a headline. A cautionary tale. They didn't see the melted wrappers or smell the rot under the sugar.

I don't even understand what happened in that apartment. Did they even know about what happened?

I looked towards the building doors, wide open like a gaping mouth. Cops moved in and out, and the coroner arrived on the scene. Some took photos, some just stood there with their hands over their faces, trying not to be sick. An investigator was bouncing around, asking questions, scribbling a few things down as he tried getting as much info as he could before he made his way towards me and handed me his card.

*“If you ever need anything to talk, kid, just call that number. We’ll figure this out.”* And with that he was gone before I could say another word.

With a sigh, I pressed my head against my hands, I caught bits and pieces of their conversation.

*""Jesus Christ...what the hell even is this?""*

*""sugared over...like some kind of–I don't even know. Ritual thing?""*

*""Wasn't there a few cases like this back in '66?""*

The older of the two cops grimaced, lighting a cigarette and popping it in his mouth with a deep inhale while his partner looked confused.

""*Which ones?*""

*""A couple of cases, ranging from kids to young adults…but they died similarly. No skin, I think, I remember readin' em""*

I pressed my forehead harder against the window, the glass cool against my skin, but not enough.

Nothing was enough to pull the smell out of my nostrils, the sticky feeling from my hands lingering.

The radio squawked again, voices overlapping, but all I heard was the old cop mutter something under his breath as he crushed the cigarette underneath his boot.

**BREAKING NEWS: GRUESOME DISCOVERY IN RUNDOWN APARTMENTS**

*""Police have concluded their investigation into a disturbing case at the Maplewood apartments earlier this week, where the body of 22-year-old Molly Tate was discovered in what authorities initially described as 'unusual and ritualistic circumstances'. The victim was found deceased in her home, surrounded by insects, candy that the police suspect as drugs, and other materials. Police reports cite extreme decomposition and mutilation, leading investigators to initially suspect drug-related psychosis or cult involvement.""*

*""The unnamed witness, a long-time friend of the deceased, was taken into custody at the scene for questioning. Sources say inconsistencies in her statement and past behavioral concerns flagged her for further investigation. However, no formal charges have been filed at this time.*

*Authorities note a strange connection to several unsolved cases from the 1960s where victims were found under eerily similar circumstances–homes invaded internally and bodies skinned and mutilated. Police emphasize there is no ongoing threat to the public at this time, and the cause of death remains officially listed as 'undetermined'.*

*In other news, city officials remind residents that the Annual Harvest Festival is this weekend. Stay Safe and enjoy the festivities!""*

I turned off the TV, the apartment was quiet except for the soft, almost imperceptible sound of something crinkling under my bed.",1,1751566551.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

This post is for people living near Amsterdam or in the Netherlands. Sorry about it but long distance is not my thing..

I live in Amsterdam and living in Europe for more than 15 years. I am learning Dutch and I’m more confident that I will learn it someday unlike German 😅

I’m a 36-year-old Indian origin, whose father says he is no longer Indian 🤣. Probably because I picked up things from various cultures while living in and traveling to multiple countries, and they really changed how I see and live my life. I’ve light tanned skin, Black hair, Brown eyes, 183cm tall (not tall by Dutch standards, but I can reach things on the top shelf), broad shoulders, slightly muscular, and powered mostly by hugs.

I work in senior management at an international company – fancy title, but still can’t remember name of people I meet.

Now onto the good stuff…

Who am I?

📸 Photography nerd – will lie in mud for the perfect sunset shot.

🏍️ Motorbike rider – nothing beats a long ride with no destination.

🥾 Hiking enthusiast – let’s climb something tall and wonder why we did.

🍳 Lazy-ass cook – food’s great, but I don’t follow recipes, I follow mood.

🍰 Sweet tooth champion – will propose if you bake a great cake.

🏋️‍♂️ Lift weights – Muscles and fitness is as important as eating cake.

✈️ Travel addict – have passport, seen many countries, will explore more. Next dream: settle near water, adopt pets, live slow.

Looking for someone who fit at least one or two things below.

• Enjoys hugs and cuddles like I do oxygen.

• Likes travel, nature, and lazy Sundays.

• Takes care of her body and health (but yes, we can eat cake).

• Is open to pets and future waterside living.

• Love to Bake (or at least enables my dessert addiction).

I love affection – hugs, cuddles, forehead kisses, the whole warm and fuzzy package. I don't enjoy penetrative sex, but show my love/intimacy through touch, affection and closeness. So, if you are comfortable with this and think you can bear with me in real life then send me a message!

Let’s make a life full of adventure, laughter, and cake crumbs.

We will be a good match if you don't think a “great connection” means endless texting and a job interview 😂 Let's have a real-life convo over coffee, a walk, or anything low-pressure.

Note: I’m also looking for new friends (any gender) to hangout and do activities outside but I approach dating and friendships differently, so please mention in your message that you read this post else I will keep you only in friend zone 🤣",0,1751566476.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.25,False

It was still night by the time they were approaching the Sand Kingdom’s border. The ethereal moonlight gleamed against the distant dunes that lay beyond verdant flats and dried shrubbery that had dared to mingle with the desert.

Qibli felt a gentle hum from inside his satchel and something in his chest tightened. He discretely peered inside, spitting out a tiny ember for its light.

KINKAJOU IS AWAKE AND FINE. PLEASE TELL TAMARIN. DARKSTALKER TAKING THE TRIBE TO THE OLD NIGHT KINGDOM IN THE MORNING.

A moment later: EVERYONE DEFINITELY UNDER HIS SPELL EXCEPT KINKAJOU.

*Kinkajou! She’s all right!* Qibli held back his elation long enough to close his satchel, then allowed himself a quick excited loop around in the air. Oh how he wished he were still at Jade Mountain so he could tell Tamarin and Sunny and see their faces!

“What are you flapping about like a seal pup for?” Winter asked from his left.

“Nothing important,” Qibli answered. Winter would probably want to know that Kinkajou was all right, but he was still under Darkstalker’s spell. Until he was free from it, Qibli couldn’t risk giving him sensitive information, especially about Turtle. “I’ll tell you if you put on one of my earrings.”

Winter’s eyes narrowed. “You’re never going to let this go, are you?” he mumbled.

“Only one way to stop it.” Qibli flicked his earring with a smirk.

Winter’s punctuated grunt was thick with exasperation; a clear indication he was too exhausted to argue back. Qibli, too, felt his eyelids grow heavy, so they agreed to rest for a few hours.

A shiver crawled through his back, maybe a little bit of warmth would help him relax. The thin branched vegetation that somehow thrived in the arid climate was perfect kindling for a bonfire. But by the time Qibli dug the pit and lit the wood ablaze, Winter was already sound asleep. It would probably burn through quickly, but Qibli wouldn’t stay awake for long either.

Unease still lingered in his mind, unable to stop himself from ruminating on Turtle’s last message. *The old kingdom of night, the one we had to find to save Jade Mountain. Now Darkstalker is going to take his tribe of superpowered followers there, as king. Is Moon going with him? Is she okay, or did Darkstalker enchant her too? And how are we going to get there on our own?* 

Qibli curled into himself and partially buried his snout in the sand. *And what about Tsunami? Did she even make it to the Rainforest with the earrings? Or did something happen to her? Why didn’t Turtle mention anything about that?*

The bonfire began to sizzle its last few embers, the sputters of light unable to reach beyond the pit, leaving the two of them shrouded in darkness. Time somehow passed Qibli by faster than he expected, yet the taut tangle of worry still lingered.

He began to think of Kinkajou and how her bubbly and fearless attitude might have thrown Vulture off. He thought of Moon, and the time they spent together at Possibility waiting for Winter. It helped ease Qibli’s mind and he slowly drifted into slumber.

They awoke at the cusp of dawn; a tiny sliver of the sun, still hidden behind the horizon, illuminated the sky with an oceanic blue. Winter hastily washed his scales in a nearby stream before they continued their journey further into the Sand Kingdom.

They flew for a few more hours until, finally, the hazy outline of the Scorpion Den emerged from the crest of a particularly large dune in the bright morning light.

“We’ll need to walk the rest of the way there,” Qibli brushed Winter with a wing flap for his attention, then pointed at the dunes below. “I can’t disguise you, but we can avoid telegraphing to the whole town you’re here before we’re even inside.”

Winter glanced at the scales of his forearm, wincing slightly as a glimmer of reflected sunlight struck his eyes. He didn’t reward Qibli with a nod, but still followed him to the ground.

The grainy sand that nestled itself between Qibli’s talons as he landed felt like a warm, welcoming embrace. The kind that Thorn would sometimes give him, and hoped Cobra would one day give.

“So what’s the plan?” Winter asked. He grimaced at his talon seasoned with sand, before he tried shaking the grains off. “I sincerely hope it's not just ‘sneak in and hope for the best’.”

“I’m not sure,” Qibli muttered apprehensively. “We’re definitely not sneaking into my grandfather’s compound. It’s the most well-fortified structure in Pyrrhia and it’s littered with traps and mines and wires everywhere.”

“Nonsense,” Winter huffed. “The Great Ice Cliff has repelled invaders for thousands of years. I doubt your grandfather could ever compare.”

“Okay, but,” Qibli continued, ignoring Winter’s pedantic aside, “the important part is that *we can’t* sneak in. One wrong step and oops, there goes a leg. Accidentally trip a wire and suddenly your head is on the ground. So we’ll first gather information on what Vulture’s been up to.” He brought his gaze back up, the gates of the Scorpion Den now in sight. His heart began pounding with trepidation. “Which means visiting my mother. And then… I’ll probably have to talk to… him.”

“That's it?” The immeasurable disappointment in Winter’s voice was palpable, despite the awkward stumbling he began walking with — thrashing and swiping his legs against himself, hoping the sand would eventually stay off his scales. “Saunter up to your crime-lord grandfather, ask him nicely to let Ostrich go, and hope he doesn’t throttle you?”

“There’s nothing else we *can* do,” Qibli admitted, then glanced at the silver jeweled circlet adorning Winter’s head. “Oh, and you’ll need to lose the crown — ankle bag too.” He swiveled the satchel around his neck to Winter’s side and opened it.

“Excuse me?” Winter barked with the indignity and inflection only a royal could ever produce. “I most certainly will not!” He tilted his snout toward the sky with his usual haughty sneer.

With a quick sleight-of-talon, Winter’s pouch found its way onto Qibli’s claws. He hooked it onto a wing-talon, dangled it over his open satchel, then sharply whistled for Winter’s attention while wearing a very smug grin.

The IceWing’s disinterested scowl quickly vanished once he recognized it, even shooting a quick glance at his ankle out of disbelief. His dumbfounded eyes tracked the pouch perfectly as it gingerly plopped into Qibli’s satchel.

“Better hurry before someone else beats me to it,” Qibli added with a pleased chuckle.

Winter quickly dumped his silver tiara into the satchel and continued marching forward with a hilarious pout. “On second thought, I’m okay with the ‘you getting throttled’ part of the plan.”

“You’re joking, but that’s probably exactly what’s going to happen.”

The gateway to the town was strangely unguarded, which Thorn would have never allowed. Clearly, it was just the first of many changes that the den underwent after the Outclaws left for the Sand Palace.

The marketplace residing beyond the archway, however, seemed the same as Qibli remembered it. Ramshackle stalls strewn of palm wood and colorful cloth dotted the plaza enclosed by buildings of sandstone. Merchants shuffled out their inventory for display — all manner of assorted trinkets, weapons, or spices. The scent of tea and coffee swept through the air as barkeeps prepared the morning brew. It barely masked the faint miasma of sickness and death that permeated the town. 

Winter surveyed the plaza with a faint sneer, judging even the slightest bit of uncleanliness or impropriety. Already he was attracting suspicious glares from a few of the locals, which he appeared hopelessly oblivious to.

“Watch it!” jeered a cloaked SandWing as their shoulder bumped against Qibli’s. A lonely dragon-skull tattoo at the base of their neck greeted him before the cloaked figure swaggered away.

Qibli knew the game that was being played — luckily, he was better at it. He discretely patted his satchel: it felt as heavy as it should be, so nothing had been stolen. His talons produced a small gold coin, and he slipped it inside the pouch.

“This place seems so…” Winter tapered off as he mulled for the right word. 

“Charming? Full of character?” Qibli cheerfully offered.

“Destitute and unkempt.”

“I think you mean charming, though we are pretty unkempt,” Qibli said playfully, lightly jabbing Winter with his elbow. “I get it, though. Not used to life outside the prim and proper palaces yet. You’ll get there!”

“But not even Possibility was this unsanitary,” Winter remarked.

A part of Qibli felt a troubling hint of truth in Winter’s words. The Scorpion Den was always balanced precariously between two opposing forces. The Outclaws Thorn led through strength, courage, and compassion. Then there was the underworld filled with greed, corruption, and a whole lot of murder. The world Grandfather thrived in.

But with Thorn gone, what was keeping the underworld in check?

“Gah!” Winter yelped as something stopped him in his tracks. His right leg was caught in the grasp of a hobbled SandWing. A thin and frail figure with pale scales and festering sores barely covered by stained dressings. His eyes sullen and sunken, shooting the startled IceWing a despondent stare. 

“Please,” the SandWing pleaded, “any food or coin you can spare?”

Winter stood paralyzed; his jaw slack and his expression vacant. Qibli couldn’t tell if he took great offense over some dirty peasant thing daring to touch royalty, or if he was genuinely at a loss at what he should do. 

“I… Um…” Winter finally stammered out. 

“Here.” Qibli reached into his pouch and tossed the small gold coin toward the beggar. 

Immediately the SandWing’s eyes lit up; he hadn’t ever expected to be given even the slightest bit of kindness. That was probably why he went for Winter, he was very obviously an outsider.

The SandWing caught Qibli’s offering, briefly fumbling the coin before cupping it in his talons. “Th-thank you…” he said, talons trembling with gratitude, before returning to ogle at the coin.

Winter, meanwhile, had been vigorously wiping the smudge left on his leg. He grimaced at his open palm, which had collected some of the grime to his dismay. But as they left the beggar, he stared back at him with a ponderous expression then looked to Qibli.

“Nicked it off one of Vulture’s thugs back there,” Qibli answered before Winter could ask. “But I gotta know. Have you *ever* lived outside the Ice Palace before Jade Mountain? You looked as though you’ve never seen a dragon down on their luck before.”

“Only when I got kicked out for losing Hailstorm,” Winter said. “Lynx and her father let me stay with them at their estate until I was allowed back into the palace. I don’t think I’ve ever visited any of the villages though.”

The largest residential district of the den was just past the main plaza; colorful stalls and merchants gave way to featureless sandstone buildings and barely kept-together tents. Sun bleached scrawls of once mahogany paint were tucked away in the corners, some to mark territory and others left by dragonets for some long abandoned game. Buckets of sand lined some of the rooftops with simple levers to put out wayward fires. And several homeless dragons were scattered around; some half asleep in the gutter, others twitching about in their tents. 

There weren't this many before, from what Qibli remembered. Vulture certainly would let every other dragon wallow in suffering before he ever inconvenienced himself. The den was firmly worse off without Thorn. 

Despite that obvious fact, a comically large poster nailed to a nearby bulletin board displayed a defaced and unflattering portrait of the recently crowned queen. It lambasted her as a fraud, a failure, and claimed the Eye of Onyx to be a farce.

Winter’s disquieted expression fell as he surveyed the downtrodden dragons ahead, and his brow curled with revulsion. Qibli felt similarly appalled, though probably not for the same reasons.

“Queen Glacier would never allow something like this,” Winter grimly remarked.

“Thorn wouldn’t have left any of these dragons like this either,” Qibli pointed out.

“What’s stopping her?” Winter curtly said, narrowing his eyes. “IceWings take care of our own all across the kingdom.”

“As far as you know,” Qibli felt Winter’s words drive an icicle into his chest, creating a tightness he interpreted as anger. “And if forcing you to die in a cave for being a disappointment was their idea of ‘taking care of you’, then imagine how much worse regular IceWings have it.”

“That’s not what I meant! It’s just…” Winter squirmed, still swiping his smudged talon against the sand while they walked, as if that was equally important. “Thorn isn't some rogue or outlaw anymore, she’s the queen. Her tribe and kingdom are her responsibility now.”

“So every single IceWing in your oh-so-amazing kingdom has a home, is well-fed, and is perfectly taken care of?” Qibli whipped his tail, flicking a spray of sand at the IceWing. “I mean obviously you would know since you’ve spent so much time outside the palace.”

“We have the gift of subsistence, so at least no IceWing ever goes hungry like this,” Winter growled, tilting his head toward an unconscious SandWing slumped against the gutter as they passed him.

“MAGIC! Of course! The answer to everything!” Qibli nearly yelled, grinding himself to a halt. Images of Darkstalker’s scroll burning into a pile of ash flashed in front of him. “Well I hate to break this to you Prince Perfect, but not everyone has magic to solve all their problems.” 

*Thanks to you*.

Winter recoiled, nearly tripping over himself. He then circled around to face Qibli with widened eyes.

“You just don’t get it,” Qibli snarled, clenching the sand as if he were strangling it. “So stop pretending that you care.”

Winter was quiet for a long while. He furrowed his brow, his wings sagged closer to the ground. The anger bubbling within Qibli slowly simmered down as he intently examined the IceWing.

“Maybe you’re right,” Winter muttered, gazing woefully upon his dirty talons. “There’s probably a lot I don’t know about both of our kingdoms.”

This wasn’t the Winter that Qibli knew. The haughty IceWing prince — nephew to Queen Glacier — that he enjoyed teasing and prodding. Winter, who was always prideful and self-righteous and stubborn but still insufferably heroic behind it all. No, something about this Winter was getting under Qibli's scales, and he wasn't sure why. Perhaps because he wasn't acting predictably, or maybe Winter actually had a point. Had he truly changed, or was this Darkstalker's spell talking? 

Worst of all, Winter’s words kept repeating in his mind. Over and over again. Thorn was the SandWing queen. She doesn't operate in the Scorpion Den anymore, but isn’t there something she can do for the dragons here? And if so, why hasn’t she? 

*No. If there was, she would have done something already.* Qibli tried to reassure himself. *She is the best queen in all of Pyrrhia. She’d never let this happen if she could do something about it.*

“It’s fine,” Qibli hastily said, wanting to forget what had happened. “Let’s keep moving before we make a big scene.”

As they turned the corner to enter a cramped alleyway, Qibli caught a glimpse of shadows slinking behind them. They were being followed, as Qibli expected they would. Winter’s immaculately clean and sparkly scales, save for the now dirtied talons and smudged ankle, practically screamed “I’m a rich and easy mark”. But they hadn’t made a move yet, despite plenty of opportunities to. Qibli already had a run in with a cutpurse earlier, but they had been left alone since. No convenient dragonets running up to them to catch a stray toy ball. No aggressive passerby looking for a fight to size them up. Nothing — and that’s what worried Qibli the most.

Without a word, Qibli nudged Winter to keep moving. They continued through the alleyway and into the neighborhood that Qibli avoided for the past two years. 

The overwhelming scent of incense. The buzz of the flies that swarmed the communal dump. And ahead of them, the house that Qibli spent his earliest years in, cordoned off by a dilapidated black metal fence that looked more for show.

Painful memories threatened to break into Qibli's consciousness, and he reflexively snatched Winter’s talon to anchor himself in the present. The perturbed IceWing frowned at him, then yanked his talon away.

After a slow breath in, Qibli cautiously stepped through the open gate and into the courtyard where his siblings had tried to kill him hundreds of times. A gentle gust peppered the front of his snout with wayward grains of sand. The brown clay pots hanging from the windows held decaying plant matter, baked into dried lumps from the neglect, when they were once proudly bristling cacti. The sand kicked up from Qibli’s footfalls revealed the cobblestone walkway that led him to the shambling wood door.

After two years, Qibli thought he’d moved on from this part of his life. Yet here he was, buried in the terrified, groveling, helpless head-space he had grown up in.

*I don't have to go in if I can help it…* Qibli reminded himself. *But still, Mother…*

As he approached the front, Qibli heard a sharp sneeze from behind him. He hadn't been paying attention if Winter was even following, he was too preoccupied by the dizzying labyrinth of his memories.

Slowly, Qibli nudged the wooden door open and peered inside. Darkness swallowed everything several feet beyond the doorway. Every ounce of energy he had was then spent on pushing one single word out of his throat. 

“Mother?”

The heavy, foreboding silence inside smothered the sound of his voice.

“Oh… you lived… here?” Winter said carefully, examining the seemingly abandoned house. Qibli pretended he said that with pompous arrogance. It was more familiar — the good kind. The kind that Qibli needed right now.

*I can’t have those walls around me again*, Qibli shuddered. The rough smell of coriander seeds tugged at him.

“Mother?” he called once more.

Silence still, the darkness inside indifferent to his pleas.

*She’s all right*, Qibli told himself. *She’s one of the smartest and deadliest dragons in the Scorpion Den. She must have left long ago.*

*Or maybe Grandfather got to her, but he wouldn't…*

“She’s not here,” said a mocking voice behind him.

Winter and Qibli whirled around. Two dragons were perched on top of the courtyard walls, one on either side of them. Their venomous tails coiled carelessly over the edge beside them, both sharing malevolently delighted expressions. 

“Hello, Sirocco. Rattlesnake,” Qibli said, steeling his voice to sound calm. “Long time no see. You both look…” *even more cruel than before…* “older. Where is Mother?”

“Motha don’t want to see you no more,” Sirocco spat in his gravelly voice. 

Qibli spotted a trio of dragon-skull tattoos marching down the side of Sirocco’s neck as he whipped his gaze to his sister. Rattlesnake herself had five trailing from the corner of her left eye, almost like they were teardrops.

“But Grandfather does,” Rattlesnake announced in a menacing singsong. 

“Better come with us nice and quiet like,” Sirocco added. “He don’t like to wait.”

“Or you could…” Rattlesnake tittered like a hyena between sentences. “Fight back. That’d be lots more fun!” She flicked her forked tongue towards Winter. “Your shiny toy there looks like it’d make funny squeaks when it bleeds.”

Winter slitted his eyes at Rattlesnake, undeterred by her threats.

“Ruining your fun was always my specialty,” Qibli said with a strained chuckle, desperately trying not to sound like he was two years old all over again. The air around him felt oppressive, like it was about to crush him and all his cleverness into a fine paste. *I have animus friends and magic bracelets, I’m not the same weak and powerless dragon I was back then.* “I need to speak to Grandfather anyway. How is he? Is he still the same barrel of laughs he’s always been?”

“Come see for yourself,” Rattlesnake said, flicking her tail toward the alley they came from.

Qibli caught the sideways frown Winter sent his way and shrugged. This would get them into Grandfather’s compound, although he couldn’t guarantee they’d ever come out again.

His brother and sister led the way while Qibli and Winter followed close behind.

“So where *is* Mother, exactly?” Qibli asked.

“She’s… busy,” Sirocco droned.

“Let’s just say she hasn’t been the same since you abandoned us,” Rattlesnake hissed with a slimy smile.

“What does that mean?” Qibli asked.

“You’ll see,” sang Rattlesnake.

Qibli’s mind began churning with thoughts. *Mother regrets letting me go. So she does love me! Wait, no. She’ll probably be furious I’m back. Grandfather also knows I'm here, but how? Were Sirocco and Rattlesnake the ones trailing us? Was it because of that cut-purse earlier? Did Onyx guess I would come after Ostrich and was this all a setup? She’s not that smart, is she?*

*Also, how should I play this? I could pretend I'm here to rejoin the family. Grandfather wouldn’t believe it though. Maybe he wants something from me? But he probably won't let me leave, even without Ostrich. Maybe I can trick him into bringing her to me then we make a break for it? Would that be clever enough for Mother to notice? Will she think I'm interesting? What if they're all under Darkstalker’s spell too?*

Something tugged at Qibli’s neck while his mind sifted through the deluge of thoughts, and he stole a glance at Winter. The IceWing was clearly unhappy with the situation, his scowl fixed firmly ahead on Sirocco and Rattlesnake. He recalled an earlier idea he had for the earring and felt compelled to test it. 

With one quick swipe, weight shifted to his left talons, Qibli pulled out the spare amber earring from his satchel. He clenched it between his claws as he continued to follow without so much a stumble.

The two cactus-lickers, sharing Rattlesnake’s strawberry-sized brain between them, stopped at an intersection to bicker over which way to go next. 

With deft talons, Qibli pinned the earring to one of Winter’s dorsal scales. His tail mindlessly swept against his back, as if to shoo away whatever insect was responsible. Fortunately, the earring was safely obscured by the icicle-like spines surrounding it.

“So,” Qibli said, nudging his wing against Winter’s, “what do you think Moon and Turtle are up to?”

“Hm?” Winter dragged his attention, almost reluctantly, to Qibli. “I’m guessing they’re still in the Rainforest with Darkstalker.” He paused, then frowned. “Why? What’s gotten into you this time?”

“Just a bit worried about them is all,” Qibli said airily. “I mean, who wouldn’t be? With everything going on and a giant ancient super-powered NightWing hovering over them.”

“I’m not,” Winter declared with disappointing confidence. “They’ll be safe with Darkstalker around. Really, you should stop worrying about them. There’s nothing you can do to help them anyway.”

*The earring definitely isn't working*. *So it has to be worn on the ear.* Qibli also bit back the urge to yell at Winter for saying he couldn’t do anything to help Moon. The fear and helplessness he felt wriggled further into the wrinkles of his awareness, gripping ever so tighter with each minute he spent near his family.

“Whaddaya two on about?” Sirocco barked. 

“Oh we were just talking about how good the dragon-skull tattoos look on you,” Qibli lied with a mollifying grin. He almost choked holding back a violent retch in his throat.

“Oh hehehe. Got you jealous, don’t I!” Sirocco’s maw twisted into some semblance of a smile. 

“Shut it, dung-for-brains,” Rattlesnake hissed. “He was talkin’ about me, not your ugly mug. Now get a move on, all ya! Can’t keep the boss waiting.”

They turned down an alleyway that suddenly turned left, then right, then ended in a wall six dragons high. Sirocco pushed one of the bricks, grabbed the revealed handle, and slid open the secret door to Grandfather’s compound. One by one, they filed into the cramped, dimly lit tunnel.

A few twists and turns later, the tunnel finally opened up to an extravagant lobby. An ostentatious display of decadence, lavishly decorated with an assorted menagerie of art, silk, and golden treasures displayed on pedestals. The only marble in this region of the kingdom tiled the floor, with intricate designs and patterns drawn with gold. 

Neither Thorn nor any of her Outclaws had ever set foot into Vulture’s compound. But Qibli had been here a few times when he was young. Mostly for family gatherings pertaining to their criminal enterprises. But this place seemed more excessive than what he remembered. Or perhaps he’d grown to appreciate simplicity while living with Thorn.

They turned the corner at the end of the foyer and approached a massive, emerald-studded set of double doors. Golden SandWing statues with black-diamond eyes and gaping maws, as if they were silently roaring, lined the short hallway that led to it. Winter probably hadn’t noticed, but they were standing in one of the compound's many traps. The doors behind them, although propped open now, could snap shut and the dragon statues could emit a poisonous gas.

*Some of those diamond eyes seem loose. Could probably sell those for a good amount*, Qibli thought. The entire compound was a complete waste of wealth. Wealth that could help the many impoverished dragons suffering right on Vulture’s doorstep. 

But stealing from Vulture would mean certain death. And as far as Qibli knew, no one had ever gotten away with it.

As Sirocco and Rattlesnake pushed the grandiose doors open, Qibli could feel the scorn emanating from his IceWing friend. He hoped Winter could contain his haughty arrogance in front of Grandfather. He hoped he wasn’t leading the two of them into an ambush. He could probably leverage his royalty as a deterrent, so long as Vulture wasn’t aware of Winter’s supposed death.

“Let me do all the talking,” Qibli whispered to Winter.

“That's usually how conversations with you go anyway,” Winter observed.

The pavilion beyond the doors was laden with pillars of marble. Turquoise and ruby gemstones dotted the columns with spiral patterns, and scarlet silk tapestry draped the archways bridging each pillar. The ceiling itself was a dome set with mirrors, reflecting light from a few small lanterns to brightly illuminate the center of the circular room.

 A few cloaked dragons lurked around the pillars, and nestled right in the center of the room was Qibli’s grandfather. 

Vulture’s long neck and hooked snout hovered over a wooden box. Empty black eyes, like bottomless pits devoid of any light, examined the structure as he slouched comfortably upon his cushioned dais. He had added to his collection of dragon-skull tattoos, at this point almost looking like a spotted leopard, with pale-yellow scales weaving between jagged splotches of black. He wore a black cloak with gold lining, wings draped with gold chains. His claws were dipped with gold lead, and enormous gold-black earrings shaped like spiders gleamed in his ears. 

He didn’t look up as Qibli and Winter approached. Beside him were four other dragons, one of which was a garishly decorated MudWing, who were also focused on the structure in front of them. It was a little maze, Qibli realized as he drew closer. And inside were two scavengers scrambling in a panic from one dead end to another. 

*Oh no— Winter please don't react…*

Winter drew a sharp gasp and took a step forward. Qibli quickly blocked him with his wing, but the noise was enough to make Vulture look up. 

“Qibli,” he said with the most crooked smile. “So it seems you’ve finally come to your senses.”",2,1751566417.0,WingsOfFire,0,1.0,False
