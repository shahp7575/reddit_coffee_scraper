Ena hadn’t spoken to anyone in two days. Her voice glitched when she tried—soft syllables turning into static, her words rearranging themselves mid-sentence. No one seemed to notice anyway.

She sat under the rusted overhang of an old bus stop, clutching a tin cup that used to hold paintbrushes. Now it held hope. The last coin she’d gotten was a week ago. Someone dropped it in by mistake, thinking she was a sculpture.

Her stomach hurt. It always hurt now.

The city around her moved in fast-forward. People with coffee, people with headphones, people with somewhere to be. Ena just had now. No before. No after. Just now.

She wandered alleyways when it rained. That day, she passed by a bakery, its window fogged with warmth. The smell was unbearable—cinnamon, bread, life. She counted her coins again. Seventy-two cents.

A small pastry in the window cost one-fifty.

Ena pressed her forehead to the glass. Her face flickered blue. Then pink. Then nothing.

A boy inside noticed her. He waved. She smiled faintly, then looked away. When she turned back, he was gone.

She sat back on the sidewalk, defeated. Her fingers trembled as she reached into her coat and pulled out a tiny crumpled paper—her sketch. A self-portrait, unfinished. The lines of her own face were soft and fractured, eyes wide and lost.

Then, a soft tap. The bakery door opened.

The boy was there again, holding a small brown bag.

“It’s not much,” he said, placing it next to her. “But I thought you looked hungry.”

She stared at it. Her glitching stopped for a moment.

She nodded slowly, then whispered, “Thank you.” The word broke into pixels as it left her lips—but it was real.

Inside the bag: a warm roll. Simple. But it was food. And someone had seen her.

She ate slowly, trying to make it last.

That night, under the same bus stop, Ena curled up with her sketchbook in her lap. She added something new—a small boy in a warm place.

She didn’t cry. She couldn’t.

But the wind stopped howling, just for a little while.",1,1746751986.0,ENA,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best blanket chests combine durability, functionality, and aesthetic appeal. Several key features differentiate top-tier models from their less impressive counterparts.

**Material Quality and Construction**

The quality of materials and construction significantly impacts the longevity and appearance of a blanket chest. Solid wood, such as cedar, pine, or oak, is often preferred for its durability and natural beauty. Cedar chests are particularly prized for their aromatic properties, which help repel moths and protect stored items. High-quality construction involves sturdy joinery, smooth finishes, and robust hardware.

**Storage Capacity and Dimensions**

The storage capacity of a blanket chest should align with your specific needs. Consider the dimensions of the chest and the internal storage space available. Larger chests are suitable for storing multiple blankets, quilts, and pillows, while smaller chests may be ideal for linens, seasonal clothing, or toys. Internal dividers or trays can enhance organization within the chest.

**Safety Features**

Safety is a paramount concern, especially for households with children. Look for blanket chests equipped with safety hinges or lid supports that prevent the lid from slamming shut. These features ensure that the lid closes slowly and gently, reducing the risk of injury. Ventilation holes or gaps are also important to prevent suffocation if someone accidentally becomes trapped inside.

**Style and Design**

Blanket chests are available in a wide range of styles, from traditional to contemporary. Choose a design that complements your existing décor and personal taste. Traditional chests often feature ornate carvings, raised panels, and antique finishes. Contemporary chests may have clean lines, minimalist designs, and modern hardware. Consider the color, finish, and overall aesthetic appeal of the chest to ensure it enhances your living space.

**Lid Stay Mechanism**

A reliable lid stay mechanism is crucial for ease of use and safety. High-quality lid stays hold the lid securely in an open position, preventing it from falling unexpectedly. Look for mechanisms that are smooth, quiet, and durable. Some chests feature soft-close hinges that gently lower the lid, adding an extra layer of safety and convenience.

**Aromatic Cedar Lining**

Many premium blanket chests feature an aromatic cedar lining. Cedarwood is naturally resistant to moths, mildew, and other pests, making it an excellent choice for storing textiles and valuables. The cedar lining also imparts a pleasant fragrance that freshens stored items. Ensure that the cedar lining is thick and well-maintained to maximize its protective properties.

Key features of the best blanket chests include:

* Durable solid wood construction
* Ample storage capacity
* Safety hinges and lid supports
* Aromatic cedar lining
* Variety of styles and designs

 ## Core Benefits

A well-chosen blanket chest offers numerous practical and aesthetic benefits, making it a valuable addition to any home.

**Enhanced Storage and Organization:** Blanket chests provide a convenient and stylish way to store blankets, linens, clothing, and other items. By consolidating these items into a dedicated storage space, you can declutter your home and maintain a more organized living environment. For example, storing seasonal blankets in a blanket chest during the warmer months frees up valuable closet space.

**Protection of Valuables:** Cedar-lined blanket chests offer superior protection for stored items, particularly textiles. The natural properties of cedarwood repel moths, mildew, and other pests that can damage fabrics. This helps preserve the quality and longevity of your blankets, quilts, and other valuables. An example would be storing antique quilts or heirloom linens in a cedar chest to prevent damage from pests and humidity.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Décor Enhancement:** Blanket chests add a touch of elegance and character to any room. Whether you prefer a traditional, rustic, or contemporary style, there is a blanket chest to complement your décor. The chest can serve as a focal point in the room, adding visual interest and enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal. A beautifully crafted blanket chest can serve as a decorative accent in a living room, bedroom, or entryway.

**Versatile Functionality:** Blanket chests can serve multiple purposes beyond storage. They can be used as a bench or seat in an entryway or bedroom, providing a comfortable place to sit while putting on shoes or relaxing. Some chests also feature a flat top that can be used as a side table or coffee table. This versatility makes blanket chests a practical and functional addition to any home.

**Preservation of Memories:** Many families use blanket chests to store cherished mementos, such as baby clothes, wedding gowns, and family heirlooms. A blanket chest provides a safe and secure place to preserve these items for future generations. The chest becomes a repository of memories, connecting you to your family history and heritage. Preserving family photos, letters, and keepsakes in a blanket chest ensures they are protected from damage and easily accessible for reminiscing.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about blanket chests to help you make an informed purchase.

**What is the best material for a blanket chest?**
  Solid wood, particularly cedar, pine, or oak, is generally considered the best material for a blanket chest. Cedar is prized for its aromatic properties and resistance to pests, while pine and oak offer durability and aesthetic appeal. The choice of material depends on your budget, style preferences, and storage needs.

**How do I care for a cedar-lined blanket chest?**
  To maintain the aromatic properties of a cedar-lined blanket chest, lightly sand the interior cedar surfaces every few years. This will help release the natural oils and refresh the cedar scent. Avoid using harsh chemicals or cleaning products on the cedar lining, as they can damage the wood. Regularly vacuum the interior to remove dust and debris.

**What safety features should I look for in a blanket chest?**
  Safety hinges or lid supports are essential to prevent the lid from slamming shut. Ventilation holes or gaps are also important to prevent suffocation if someone accidentally becomes trapped inside. Ensure that the chest is sturdy and well-constructed to prevent tipping or collapsing.

**Can I use a blanket chest to store clothing?**
  Yes, blanket chests are suitable for storing clothing, especially if they are cedar-lined. The cedarwood helps repel moths and other pests that can damage fabrics. However, avoid storing delicate or easily wrinkled items in a blanket chest, as they may become creased or damaged.

I’m getting on here bc I don’t know where else to ask or go to for advice anymore, I have been feeling off and bad for a couple years and been struggling. I have gone to my primary dr multiple times for blood work, she would refer me to other specialists like I went to an endocrinologist who just told me I was overweight( overweight people already know that) I am trying to change that. She didn’t help much and just told me to continue dieting and if I’m still having problems see a cardiologist. My
Primary prescribed me sertraline and just kept upping the dose every time I would come in and say I haven’t noticed a difference besides it making me tired so I eventually stopped taking it. She then had me go to a neurologist who Just briefly talked to me and told me to take b12 and see if that helped. I went back to my primary and she had me do an mri and it came back normal. I have been having symptoms of feeling like low blood sugar all the time but my blood work and levels are for the most part normal range. I always feel like I am on the edge of fainting and I feel so tired and run down and also things just don’t seem real. I know it sounds crazy but I feel like I’m in constant fog and have researched thinking maybe depersonalization/derealizarion but idk. Drs telling me it’s just anxiety but I feel like there could be more underlying going on like heart wise? Pots seems to have similar symptoms. Idk what else it could be and I have spent so much money already trying to go to these drs who don’t seem to really care or help me. I don’t make enough money to keep seeing specialist after specialist with no answer. But I feel like I struggle to get through the work day bc I always feel so panicked that I could faint any moment and how embarrassing it is. I feel I can’t even enjoy activities outside the house anymore I just always feel so off and sick and I don’t tell co workers / friends bc I don’t want to scare them. It’s so hard though to act normal and carry on like you aren’t fighting to get through your shift / day without having a panic attack or feeling like I just need to flee and go home. Idk what else to do and feel really hopeless honestly, feel like I am living with some invisible illness and it sucks no one understands or think it’s all in my head.

I went in because I thought I needed anxiety meds and left with Vyvanse instead. I trust the dr who gave it to me, and am doing my best to stick with it. 

  
My main goal for getting treated was my mental health is the only thing I can really think to blame for, I guess, IBS. I had a dr, a nurse practicioner, and a GI all find nothing physical wrong with me. I just get intense nausea bouts and bathroom symptoms. Sometimes stress linked, sometimes not. I am a generally anxious person. 

  
I have been on 20 mg Vyvanse for 9 days. 

  
The first day was weird, it was almost like a bit of a high but generally positive. I could focus, was happy

Second day was better, no high feeling and I could just focus. I realized how much of my anxiety came from babysitting myself, all the time. I had been in a room full of my-brain-toddlers and now I was alone. Third day was much the same. My digestion was relaxed too, which was nice. Towards the evening I feel zombie like. I stare off and struggle to get myself to -do- things. 

  
The weekend was hectic, so I will write those days off as life getting in the way. Monday I felt bad on the meds. Same zombie mode towards the evening(I take the med around 8 AM and this feeling starts around 3-4)

  
Yesterday I had coffee for the first time(I think it was too much caffeine, I had coffee and then Excedrin without thinking. Like 180 mg caffeine, I have decent tolerance but hadn't touched since stimulant). Today even with less caffeine there is this zombie-like stare off as well as a physical feeling of anxiety, without the mental turmoil. 

All of this to say, I go back next week to see her and I am not sure what to ask. Higher dose? Lower Dose? Is this the wrong med for me? The first few days were very nice. I am planning to keep taking it until my appointment to just see if I am in a funk.

1ki5vt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1ki5vt7/lets_become_better_cobaristas/,Let’s become better co-baristas :),"Hi there!

Every day as a barista is different. Some days the whole shift is a streamlined rush, other days are filled with funky latte-art humor and at this one special day that occurs once a year the cake you just baked tumbles right down to the floor. These things happen, but how you handle it with your co-baristas (by this I mean coworkers who are baristas) make it memorable :)

As I spent quite some time with my co-baristas (who I by now also call friends 🫶), I started to appreciate their actions, behaviors more and I don’t take them for granted anymore. This led to to want to improve myself as a co-barista, so everyone has a better day 🪄

Let’s share the things we appreciate of our co-baristas, in order to learn from it and become better co-baristas ourselves! This could be anything; subtle behaviors, passive actions, or things that are expected of a co-barista but you’re still very appreciative of (as some of us might not be aware of it 🤓). If easier, sharing feedback (anonymous of course) could be helpful too. In case you feel fond of a hyper specific trait (even if it’s not barista particular), please share. Being aware of the things you appreciate already makes one a better co-barista :)

Some experiences that I’m fond of
- when a customer just kept talking to me at the POS and it got too personal, my co-barista made up an excuse that I was needed to ‘fix something’ so the customer moved on
- when it was rush time (I made the orders) and a customer ordered eight matcha’s (which we prepare by chasen), she extended the conversation with the customer so the orders wouldn’t pile up
- the eye contact when a customer says something unhinged and we think the same thing (the eye contact can be subtitled by ‘Girl, bye!’)
- when I dropped a full milk jug and my co-barista literally caught it, those skills🔥
- emptying the portafilters whilst I’m pouring the milk coffees 
- voluntarily cleaning the customer toilet as my co-barista knows I get the heebie-jeebies of that place
- reminding what I’m allergic to and surprising me with a cappuccino which had custom latte art (and I could drink it as my co-barista used the milk I can have)
- playing my favorite music, just because I was there

I can keep going for a while, but I should go to sleep. This could also be part of becoming a better co-barista; getting to the cafe well rested :)

Thank you for your thought!

1ki5sog,https://www.reddit.com/r/employedbykohls/comments/1ki5sog/last_day_finally/,Last Day (FINALLY!),"Tomorrow is my last shift. My official notice states May 11th as my last day. After nearly two and a half years of being a full time customer service associate I’m finally, finally leaving. Not only am I leaving for more money but closer to home, I’m also going to be working less money for just shy of double what I make a month currently.

I’ve been through enough, Kohl’s doesn’t care about us associates and it seems like they never have. I’m encouraging all of my closest friends I’ve made at work to be careful and watch management for worse behavior just in case they don’t like me leaving.

 Honestly I gave them a week’s notice, which is more than they deserve, but my coworkers deserved to know in advance. The real ones knew before the notice, I brought my favorite manager coffee yesterday as a thank you for everything she’d done to help me. 

I won’t miss the job, or the way the stress tanked aspects of my health, or the people that felt entitled to treat me however they wanted. I will miss my regulars and my coworkers who made it all bearable. 

All in all it’s for the best. If you were looking for a sign to start leaving, take this as one and go get yourself something better than Kohl’s. 

You’re worth it, I promise.

But the one piece of advice boomers are right about is cooking at home. This doesn’t include the infamous avocado toast meme or anything on the ethics of tipping. Simply cooking at home vs eating out. 

Millennials and now Gen Z eat out way too much. $5-7 for a cup of coffee that can be made at home for less than a $1 in ingredients even if adding cream and melted butter. 

Paying a service like DoorDash to deliver food that’s already way too expensive. I walked in to McDonald’s other night to get a Diet Coke and a UberEats guy was joking with the guy behind the counter that someone ordered 1 cookie. This was in a ghetto neighborhood in the Vegas area. So you can assume the guy was rich.

What about steakhouses? Why go to a steakhouse and spend $75 a person on a steak dinner when you can buy a 4 pack of steaks at Costco for $40 and go grill them in the backyard or a local park? 

If you dine in you can go to Wendy’s and spend $15 on a baconater and fries and coke or can make it at home for less than $2 in ingredients?

The couple, married for 12 years with two children, initially engaged in the coffee reading as a lighthearted activity. However, the AI's response prompted the wife to expel her husband from their home and initiate divorce proceedings. The husband expressed disbelief, noting that his wife has previously been influenced by similar beliefs, including consultations with astrologers.

During a user interview, a user told us that since they started posting storytelling content, old connections began re-engaging & DM'd them for coffee chats. 

Here’s my contrarian take: if you’re trying to build a personal brand, especially on LinkedIn, stop overselling your product or service. Just focus on creating value without expecting anything in return (yes, even “mentioning” your offer counts as an ask). People naturally gravitate toward useful content. And the serious buyers will figure out what you do on their own.

Saw someone on this sub put it perfectly, (also seen the same pattern with our users): ""Worrying about showing your offer when there’s no real audience to see it is a losing strategy.""

If done right, it’s a scalable revenue channel.  
More than 50% of Maven’s revenue (founded by the same guy who co-founded Udemy) comes from LinkedIn. Gagan Biyani, look him up, dude’s a master of storytelling over selling :)

*But a founder's job is always twofold: build and find users.*  

*Time blocks—not trade-offs—solve the clash.*  

*I spend 15 minutes a day recording a voice note; AI does the rest while I sprint on product and team.*

*Three rules that keep the balance:*

*1. Ship a post before you ship the feature.*  

*2. Show a receipt—screenshot or KPI—every week.*  

*3. Stop at fifteen minutes; perfect lines are wasted lines.*

*If you've been waiting for ""later,"" post one unpolished build update today and tag me.*

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Mr. Coffee 12-cup coffee maker range offers a variety of features designed to enhance the brewing experience. From programmable settings to pause-and-serve functionality, these features cater to different preferences and lifestyles.

**Brewing Capacity:** A standard 12-cup Mr. Coffee maker is designed to brew up to 60 ounces of coffee, which is equivalent to twelve 5-ounce cups. This capacity makes it suitable for both individual use and serving multiple people. The carafe is typically made of glass or thermal material, with clear markings to indicate water and coffee levels.

**Programmable Timer:** Many Mr. Coffee models come equipped with a programmable timer, allowing users to set a specific time for the coffee maker to start brewing automatically. This feature is particularly useful for those who want to wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. The timer is easily set using buttons and an LCD display, providing a convenient way to customize the brewing schedule.

**Pause-and-Serve Function:** The pause-and-serve function allows users to temporarily stop the brewing process to pour a cup of coffee before the entire pot is finished. This is a convenient feature for those who want a quick cup without waiting for the full brewing cycle to complete. The coffee maker automatically resumes brewing once the carafe is placed back on the warming plate.

**Water Filtration System:** Some Mr. Coffee models include a built-in water filtration system, which helps to remove impurities and improve the taste of the coffee. These systems typically use replaceable filters that need to be changed periodically. The water filtration system ensures that the coffee is brewed with clean, fresh water, resulting in a more flavorful and enjoyable beverage.

**Warming Plate:** All Mr. Coffee 12-cup coffee makers feature a warming plate that keeps the brewed coffee warm for a specified period, typically around two hours. The warming plate automatically shuts off after this time to prevent overheating and conserve energy. This feature ensures that the coffee remains at an optimal temperature for extended enjoyment.

**Automatic Shut-Off:** Many Mr. Coffee models include an automatic shut-off feature, which turns off the coffee maker after a certain period of inactivity. This safety feature prevents the coffee maker from running indefinitely and potentially causing a fire hazard. The automatic shut-off time varies depending on the model, but it is usually around two hours.

1ki5iey,https://www.reddit.com/r/HOTR_Stories/comments/1ki5iey/somewhere_else_besides_north/,Somewhere Else Besides North,"Ever since grammar school, I’d heard whispers about a place out beyond the northern edge of town—a place that didn’t just take you north, but somewhere else entirely. Kids would murmur about it during quiet time, their voices softer and breathier than even the usual teacher-forbidden visiting. On the playground, scraps of conversation would drift by on the breeze:

“…up by the old Marley place…”

“…long shadows…”

“…can’t look high enough…”

These phrases were spoken like common knowledge, passed around in hushed, reverent tones—like cancer or family troubles. I was the new kid, fresh from down south, too shy to ask questions and risk sounding dumb. So whenever a casual reference was thrown my way, I just nodded like I was in the know

Back then, I believed that place was real and took it as fact. But by middle school, I heard talk of it less and less, and finally decided it was just some children’s folk legend, like Bloody Mary or The Spidery Hand.

Then, last summer, after the last day of school, the salesman came to town.

He was here more than a week before I ever saw him. I did spy his royal blue Plymouth Mercury with silver trimmings at least once a day. Sometimes, I’d catch it gliding down Main Street while I was out on my bike or spot it rounding a corner into some quiet neighborhood. More often, I’d pass it parked in front of a house, the salesman inside working his pitch. At night, it always showed up at the Motorlodge Inn, parked in front of room number 54.

The first and only time I saw him up close was the day he came to our house. I’d just gotten back from Jimmy’s when I found him sitting across from my mom at the coffee table. He was short and pudgy, maybe around forty-five—older than my parents, anyway. His black hair was parted hard to one side and slicked down like he’d combed it in anger. It glistened, wet with gel. His heavy metal suitcase lay open on the table, though I couldn’t see what was inside. Beside it sat a half-empty glass of lemonade.

He smiled pleasantly when I came in, round cheeks puffing up, eyebrows arched in a gentle bow. He said hello, and I said hi back. Mom looked up and said, “Oh, my son’s home. I need to start dinner.” It was her classic escape plan. She always used me like that, even with phone calls from Mrs. Brottlund. I never minded. Maybe she wasn’t a good liar. Or maybe she just didn’t want to lie.

The salesman gave it one more go, trying to make the sale, but Mom said no. She was sorry, nothing interested her. He nodded and smiled, still polite. But he snapped his suitcase shut with a huff, and his eyes were tight and watery. His eyebrows were still bowed, but his smile had deflated to a spare, bloodless line. He rose from the chair and said thank you. My mom nodded and smiled. She smiled and nodded. I don’t think he sold anything to anyone in town.

That night after dinner, I went back out. It wasn’t yet dark, and Mom didn’t ask where I was going. I rode down Nagel Avenue, turned onto Main, and kept pedaling until I reached the Motorlodge. Even from a block away, I could see the salesman’s car—it was the only one in the parking lot.

I stashed my bike behind the dumpster behind the Circle K. It reeked back there, but stink doesn’t stick to bikes. I kept thinking, *What if someone sees me?* The Brottlunds? The Whites? Someone my dad works with? I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but what kind of explanation could I give that wouldn’t sound like a lie? I almost turned back—but instead, I stepped out onto the sidewalk and walked to the Motorlodge.

The curtains in room 54 were parted just enough to see through. The TV was on, tuned to some sports program. I ducked beneath the window and peeked in.

The salesman lay on the king-size bed in his undershirt, slacks, and black socks, head and shoulders propped on two pillows. A bag of pork rinds rested against his side, and a can of Tab was cradled in his hand. The cobalt light from the TV flickered over his face, casting long, shifting shadows on the wall behind him. The roar of the crowd came faintly through the speakers. He munched a pork rind. Sipped his drink. His face was all folded up and slack.

That night, I dreamed of seagulls gliding low over wide, white ice floes out in some arctic sea. The sun stood straight overhead, and the birds’ shadows streamed like black, warbling doubles on the ice. The sea was so deep and blue it was almost indigo.

The next day, the salesman was gone. Only his car remained, still parked outside his room. No one knew where he’d gone. Sonny at the barbershop said he’d seen him walking at dusk now and then. At Arnie’s Patio and Home Supplies, I heard whispers again—like the ones from school all those years ago.

“…by the old Marley place…”

“…shadows were long last night…”

“…someone should’ve told him…”

“…he’d never know to look high enough…”

As always, I stayed quiet. Nodded like I understood.

At dinner, no one mentioned the salesman. Mom started to bring it up, but then Dad told Martha to quit feeding the dog under the table.

After sunset, I told Mom I was heading to Jimmy’s. It was Friday, school was out, so she didn’t care how late I stayed. “Call if you’re going to be too late,” she said. She knew I would.

I didn’t go to Jimmy’s. I took my bike up north, to the Marley house. I’d never been there before, but I knew where it was. No one had lived there for as long as I’d been in town. It’s old and run down, the lawn is a jungle of brambles and weeds, but the windows are still intact, and as far as I know, no one has ever gone inside the house. No one calls the place haunted. Maybe because there’s something about it that’s more fearful than a haunting, and why it’s stood unbothered all these years.

I dropped my bike by the porch and walked around the place. Crickets chittered, and the wires of nearby telephone poles buzzed. I could hear cars down on Saunders Avenue. I wasn’t scared. Not even when I pressed my face to the windows, half expecting to see a pale figure staring back. There was nothing in that house. There was nothing *about* the house. It wasn't haunted. It was nothing but an old house.

Around back, the land stretches out into a field for about a mile until the hills rise up. There are trees out there, but not many. In the crabgrass, I spotted a rusted bicycle. Further on, I kicked what might have been an ancient baseball. The moon was full. The stars were blinding. I could see more clearly than I ever could in daylight—no glare, no heat, just quiet clarity. I thought about walking off into that field. Just walking and not stopping. I thought about the salesman doing the same. A night like that—you want it to last forever.

Then, far off, a shadow rolled over the hill. At first, I thought it was from a fast-moving cloud. But no cloud moves like that. Another shadow dipped left. Another dipped down to my left, a third directly in front of me. I remembered the shadows of the gulls in my dreams, but these were not shaped like birds. Not exactly.

I still heard the twitter of crickets and the buzz of the wires. But underneath that, I heard a sound like a sheet or a wing cutting the wind. The shadows were drawing nearer. Others followed behind them.

I wasn’t scared. Not then. I remember how I thought I might just stand there and wait to see what those shadows belonged to; or worse, how I might just keep on walking, like the salesman might have done, walk on out there to meet them.

But I thought of Mom and Dad, and even of Martha, the little brat. I thought that if I didn’t turn around at that moment, none of them would ever see me again.

 Even then, I didn’t feel afraid. As I turned around and walked deliberately back to the Marley house, picked up my bike, kicked up the kickstand, hopped on, and rode off, I didn’t feel afraid. It wasn’t until I was halfway to Saunders Avenue and a pressure, like the phantom cold of a long-dead frostbitten hand, pushed against my back, that I knew the shadows had caught up with me.

But then my tires hit the blacktop, and the cold lifted.

The fear didn’t.

Once I finally felt the fear, once it finally broke through that weird euphoria, it took me completely. I slammed the bike pedals, cursed the wheels for not turning faster, cursed every bump and turn that threatened to spill me to the ground.

 I skidded around the corner and hit my street, pedaling, cursing. The familiar maroon shingles spreading down the peaked roof of my house rushed to meet me. My lawn spread to grab my bike as I kicked it away, and my front porch gathered me up into its arms. And finally, through the living room, past the surprised faces, and up the stairs and into my room, which settled around me like a protective womb. 

From my window, I watched the shadows drop long that night, all night long. Every night, they kept searching, searching. All that summer, they searched. Through fall and winter, they searched. Now, spring is on its way.

And I know that if I can still feel fear, then I’ve escaped them again. That fear means I’m still here.

Cold comfort.

The shadows are long again tonight.

What has anyone else’s experience who has Autism or ADHD trying to get Permanent Work Accommodations approved by Starbucks Service Now? 

I was very excited when I found out I was hired as anyone is. As the time went on it was completely opposite of what I expected. Definitely not the upbeat happy atmosphere that you think it is as a customer. 

I’m a newbie with Starbucks I was very excited to be hired. I worked about 3 weeks and then had a complete breakdown. Please be mindful I have worked at other large coffee franchises. 

I’m aware that you have to submit a FAF form completed by a health care professional. My Family Doctor did not complete the first FAF correctly. 

I recently was diagnosed with Autism. My psychiatrist wrote a letter of recommendation accommodations for me. I misunderstood that I also needed to have my Psychiatrist submit a completed FAF form. 

I will now have my family doctor and psychiatrist each complete a new FAF form. 

My question is what happens if I spend more money for these forms to be re done and I am sent a email from Starbucks Service now stating they cannot meet the accommodate in the FAF forms I have submitted?

I have already paid for the Autism assessment myself, two doctor notes, one notes from my Psychiatrist. 

I also am having a hard time with an article that was posted on here about where the beans picked for Starbucks. They use child labour and very horrible working conditions and very unethical. 

Any helpful tips? Am I wasting my time ?",4,1746749836.0,starbucksbaristas,3,1.0,False

I have questions in regards to Bowel movements with a recent event that took place.  To give some past health information, I am 30 years old and have had no surgery in my life on my stomach.   The last week I was diagnosed with potentially a bad case of Norovirus/Gastritis/Partial Bowel Obstruction as I started to feel sick within 24 hours and my stomach bloated to the size of a beach ball. This had me in the hospital for 5 days time.  

They first did a CT scan that showed my stomach very cloudy, but with a small bowel obstruction with transition point in the right mid abdomen.  The XRay that followed showed small bowel loops compatible with small bowel obstruction.  This had me in the hospital with the NG Tube, the follow up day with the 2nd Xray they did showed improvement on day 2, and then on day 3 the 3rd Xray noted Normal bowel gas pattern.

I also was on strictly an IV for 3 days and then graduated to liquid and soft food day 4. Soft food was Chicken with sweet pot/mac n cheese, steamed carrots. Stools have been very small like finger size, but passing gas, peeing has been fine. I have not had pain either since the 2nd day of the hospital after the first day emitted.

I am a bit scared of how this did a 3 day turnaround and there isn't a true answer for what caused it or anything.  With being on the IV my legs and thighs have also bloated massively.  Is there any more advice on how to recover more?  I’ve kept on my feet with walking and drinking strictly water, juice with green tea and a cup of coffee.

I appreciate any advice given.",1,1746749710.0,BowelObstruction,0,1.0,False

1ki5cnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HOTR_Stories/comments/1ki5cnt/the_light_from_another_room/,The Light from Another Room,"I can’t imagine where I got the goddamn thing. The only reason I ever touched a flame to its four wicks in the first place was because of the blackout.

  The saying goes that there are only two seasons in the desert: hot and cold. Either a smidge of precipitation or a fine layer of clouds overhead will do your internet connection or phone reception no favors. Inclement weather can send a small enough town to hell.

So, I'd anticipated the blackout even before I’d finished the second shift at the plant. Heavy northern winds had started gusting down from the highlands around half-past-five that evening, rattling the high-placed windows in the meat-processing room. The winds grew in strength for the next two hours, until the overhead lights started flickering around a quarter past eight. The drive home was starless, and brown plumes of dirt and grit clouded the winding road in my headlights.

  At home, I battened down the garage door against the blasting gales, gathered the Mag-Lite and a box of matches from a drawer in the workbench, and hauled a box of candles off the floor. I carried all of my preparations to the kitchen table.

  Under the box’s dusty, cardboard lid, I found a dozen candles, each of varying size. The biggest was a block of wax, maybe seven-by-seven inches thick and ten inches tall. Four wicks poked out at the top, each eccentrically placed inside one of the mass's four quarters. Each was slightly charred and centered in a shallow bowl of melted wax, attesting to some previous use. Otherwise, the top of the candle was flat, and no dried rivulets ran down the sides.

  I carried the block to the living room with the aim of placing it on the coffee table, figuring it would give the greatest amount of light and burn the longest. At the very least, even if it burned faster than I estimated it ought to, I could douse three of the wicks and just burn one at a time as a conservation measure. It was quite heavy, as I expected a big hunk of wax would be, but it had a strange heft to it. Its center of gravity was somewhat wonky, like there was maybe an air pocket inside one corner, just under the surface. Setting it on a paper plate to catch the rivulets of melting wax, I gave each side a couple of firm taps but detected no weaknesses in any of the four walls.

  For the first time, the color of the candle struck me. It was darkly hued, less an uneven shade of violet than a constant but subtle shifting between tints of muted indigo and damp, brick red, depending on which angle the living room's three electric lamps caught it. Occasionally, I'd spy blotches of blackish, mossy green that seemed to bleed in and out when I tilted my head one way or the other.

  The wind was getting worse, rattling the windowpanes and pummeling the rooftop. The house lights started to flicker in tandem with each volley, so I had little interest in plumbing the depths of the big candle's superficial mysteries as I began to place other candles around the house. I only paused to assure myself that the batteries in the bedside alarm clock were fresh.

  I had just returned to the living room to switch off the power strip to the computer and the TV, when the cat started yowling on the front porch. I opened the door, and in an instant, she scampered in from the howling weather, dispensing with any feline aplomb. It was just then that the lights went out.

  Of course, I hadn’t thought to bring the flashlight with me, so I had to bump my way back to the couch blindly, stepping high to avoid the cat as she tried to rub her sides against my ankles. I patted around the cushions for a ridiculously long time before my fingertips bumped into the cold, metal sides tucked halfway under a throw pillow.

  After I was able to see again, I lit the big candle first, touching a single match flame to each of the four wicks crowning the top. I noticed nothing—*untoward*, is the world that pops into my head—nothing untoward within the reach of its glow, not right then at least. I was still using the flashlight beam as my primary source of illumination.

  Once I got the other candles lit, I sat back down on the couch and turned on a battery-powered radio, an old transistor deal. Hoping to find a local station with some news about the storm, I began tapping the dial across the bandwidth.

  An old radio is a much more subtle device than any newer deck you'll get. Today's models have scan buttons, which locate only relatively clear stations. It's a nice feature when you're driving. But, you might miss something that’s hidden in the fuzz, something ignored by the scanner, something a steady hand capable of tapping a dial back-and-forth, back-and-forth, over a pinpoint can find. Sometimes, you can stumble across conversations from a mobile phone or even a police scanner. Those are a treat. I once discovered a “numbers station”—those radio stations that broadcast an emotionally hollow female voice reciting a series of double-digit numbers. They are, I guess, suspected to be the covert communications from government agencies to spies, domestic and foreign, although no one’s really sure. There’s certainly a prosaic reason for the existence of “numbers stations,” but trust me, your hackles will rise if you ever chance upon one out of the blue.

  That night, I hit on a piece of a broadcast, a voice, startlingly clear for a second, then gone the next. Smiling, I settled myself in to guide it back out of the fuzz. The cat started rubbing up against me, stretching out a paw, and meowing for attention. I hadn’t seen her in a couple of days, so I set the radio on the table, picked her up, and put her in my lap to give her a good, solid rub-down.

  I call her “the cat” because she's a stray who started coming around the yard about three years earlier. She’d been so skinny and ragged-looking that I'd taken to putting out bowls of cat food and water for her. It hadn’t been long before she'd set foot indoors when it was cold or wet or when she’d simply wanted attention. I’d never named her because I figured that one day she’d never show up again, and I hadn’t wanted to feel any attachment to her after she was gone.

  All of the attention I’d given her, of course, had ruined the emotional distance that I’d aimed to establish in the first place. And, as the years rolled on, my affection for her had grown. It tickled me, too, that I was the only person in the world that she seemed to like. She'd hiss, run, and hide or start pawing at the door to go outside when company came over. Once, a woman who considered herself a ""cat-whisperer"" had tried to entice the cat out from under the sofa, convinced that she could bring the hissing little brute around to her way of seeing things.  She’d left with a bruised ego and a scratched wrist. The moment the door had closed behind her, the cat jumped into my lap, purring, everything right with the world again. Could I help but feel flattered?

  The wind's steady persistence in battering the house began to grow notably in force. I continued to stroke the cat, who submitted to my ministrations for a full minute until something caught her attention. Without preamble, she twisted herself upright and leapt onto the floor. Ears perked eagerly forward, she sniffed at the air and then, with cautious, deliberate steps, slinked tentatively toward a corner of the house by the front door.

  By now, my eyes had grown used to the dimness. I rose from the couch and strolled around the room, blowing out every other candle. Waste not, want not. As I snuffed the one that I’d place on the sill of the window that looks out onto the backyard, I swore.

  There was a crack in the glass, a streak of silver bisecting the pane diagonally from the upper corner on one side, all the way down to the lower corner on the other.

  I shook my head. The glass was finished. I supposed I ought to consider myself lucky that half of it hadn’t fallen out and shattered across the floor.

  I looked more closely. The ragged bottom half of the glass was speckled with dried and dusty raindrops. The dark night behind it had turned it into a dim mirror that reflected the last flame of the four-wick candle on the table. And yet, the upper half was so clear that it seemed I must be looking through an open gap in the window frame.

  But that was impossible. If the top half of the pane had been gone, the gales outside would have been howling in my ears, and the rain-soaked gusts of wind would have been smacking me around the face and neck.

  I raised my hand and traced two fingertips from the lower, dirty part of the pane upward over the crack, then took two involuntary steps backward, rubbing the tips of my fingers with my thumb.

  I had expected to confirm the optical illusion for what it was. I had anticipated as I passed my fingers upward. I had expected to find that the upper part of the pane had been slightly dislodged and was tilted at an angle from the window frame. That would have caused light to hit either section at different angles, which would, I supposed, have accounted for the illusion of a broken window.

  However, that’s not what my fingertips found.

  Instead, they traced smooth, unbroken glass. No crack. No sharp edges. No broken angles. Just a windowpane in perfectly good shape. And yet, at the same time, there was something else, just above the image of the crack. Something that I perceived for a quick instant, something that brushed along the whorls of my fingers, very subtly.

  It *was* the sharp, ragged edge of broken glass I had expected to find when a shear moment before I had felt smooth, cool glass. And hairsbreadth higher, I found a gap in the glass, and through that gap a hot, a very hot, a side-of-the-oven-hot breeze that stung the tips of my fingers.

  I again rubbed the side of my thumb against the tips of my fingers, the tingle of that burn cooling to a steel wool scrub before finally settling into a sensation of pins and needles. I couldn't doubt that I'd actually felt the sharp touch of ragged glass, nor the brief scald of impossibly hot wind. Heat or no, broken glass was certainly what my eyes were telling me I ought to have touched. And yet, I couldn't doubt that I'd also traced my fingers along a smooth, cool plane of unbroken glass.

  My mind wrestled with the sensations, as well as with the impossible sight of the broken/not-broken window. Like a double-image on a warped film loop, each condition seemed superimposed upon the other; one would rise to clarity and cancel out the other, and then the process would reverse.

  I shook my head, grasping for some sort of focus that would allow me to understand both states of being at the same time, but a sudden thump from behind threw me from my trance.

  By now, the room was nearly settled in the glow of the heavy, quadruple-wicked candle that rested on top of the coffee table. Beyond it, the cat had found something under a small side table just outside the foyer. Her tail was straight up in the air, and I saw her back legs and shoulders straining as she struggled to drag her prize out into the room.

  With a final, solid tug, she managed to wrench it out of the shadows and into the light. I doubted what I saw. I grabbed the Mag-Lite from the coffee table, aimed it at the cat, and snapped on the beam.

  The moment the light illuminated the floor, the cat skittered backward onto her rump. She gave a yowl of surprise and frustration, but was immediately back on her feet and sniffing around where her prize had been.

  She couldn't find it. I couldn't see it anymore. It was gone. The moment the Mag-Lite beam had illuminated it, it had seemed to have just vanished. I swept the beam back and forth across the length of the baseboards. Nothing. But that mystery took second place for the moment to the mystery of the thing I had seen—or thought I had seen—clenched in the cat's teeth as she tried to wrestle it out into the open.

  It had looked like a hunk of meat, of freshly cut pork flank, the kind of thing I prepare at the plant myself: red and raw at one end, white bone cleanly severed in the center, wrapped in a pale, loose sack of pigskin.

  I know what you're thinking, but trust me. I am not the kind of guy who brings his work home with him. And even if I were, I wouldn't let a hank of raw meat lay around in my living room under various and sundry pieces of furniture.

  On the radio, a blast of clarity through the static startled me. It was the unmistakable voice of a woman speaking in the emotionless, no-nonsense tone of a newscaster. At first, I took no notice of her words because something on the wall, mid-height, above the small table that had housed the cat's lost prize, caught my attention.

  It was flat and rectangular, like a medium-sized painting of a landscape or a family portrait. I'd never placed a single decoration on any wall in my house, yet one hung there now. It was neither a landscape nor a portrait. It was a sign with a white background and plain black lettering. It read: 

 

**Official LP Provider**

**Local 151**

 

  I didn't have to raise the Mag-Lite to read it. I might have thought that someone was playing a prank on me—and even if I had, it made no sense anyway; I mean, what the hell was an ""LP Provider?"" —but I knew that the sign had not been hanging on that wall when I came home. I knew that the first time I'd seen it was just now, by the glow of that weird four-pointed candle in the middle of my coffee table.  

  The wind was still battering the house. Spoken words were seeping into my consciousness. It was the voice of the woman on the radio, still droning her news report.

 

  ""*Following unconfirmed reports of hostiles southeast of Bakersfield, local militia plans to create a 'buffer zone' from northern Kern County to southern Orange County*—""

 

  By the off-kilter, warbling glow of that candle, I began to see more. My living room had . . .  distended. Normally, two people might be able to lie head-to-toe across the width of the floor, from the north wall to the south wall. Now, instead of a south wall, against which my television usually sat, there stretched a length of concrete flooring, mottled and untidy, like a foundation laid bare after the carpet had been ripped up.

 

  ""—*might soon march to the mayor's office with the intent to burn it down. The news contained in this dispatch has been re*—""

 

  It was as if the south wall had been knocked down, and I was seeing into the dining room and the kitchen beyond. In fact, it was perfectly like that. The dimensions were the same, and the boards nailed to the wall on the far side would have covered the exact spot where the dining room window would—should—be. Instead of tables and chairs, there stood what looked like a pair of wheeled carts, the same sort of carts you see in hotels that the maids use to push loads of laundry from room to room. The bags held by the carts seemed to be made from a heavy, rough material, like burlap. Dark stains spotted the sides of the material and drenched the bottom. To the right of these carts, in place of the off-white, ceramic tiles that made up the surfaces of the counters in the kitchen, stood, instead, stainless-steel cutting tables. And behind and against the west wall, instead of the stout window and the door to the porch, stood two tall, wide, stainless-steel doors that must have led to a pair of refrigeration units.

 

  ""—*clouds of chlorine gas continue to blow in from the southwest. Citizens are instructed to keep gas masks close at*—""

 

  These images seemed to be melting into my awareness, as if I were only seeing them after I had discovered the absence of what I’d expected to find. As the images began to solidify, sounds began to accompany them, along with the droning voice of the radio's newswoman. And with these sounds and sensations.

  The wind blowing outside sounded louder, as if I were hearing it not through a buffer of walls and glass, but directly. It was as if it had invaded the interior of the house through broken windows, say. The wind had a sizzle to it, which I not only heard riding its gusts but felt against my skin, tingling my arms and the side of my face. I felt it pulling at my clothes and tossing my hair. The two pushcarts squeaked as the wind rocked them gently on their wheels. The boards across the kitchen window rattled.

 

  ""—*estimated thirty-six dead before the riot was brought under control*—""

 

  But above all this, I heard another sound, a sound that was frightening for the very reason that it was so familiar. At first, I couldn't accept that I was hearing it at all, that heavy, rhythmic *thump . . .  thump . . .  thump . . .* because I had just left that sound behind, only a few hours earlier. In fact, I had been participating in the making of that sound.

  And as that rhythmic thumping began to push away nearly everything else in my awareness, I began to make out a figure in the kitchen area, among the cutting tables.

  The figure's back was to me. He had broad shoulders and thickly muscled arms. His head was bald, probably shaven. His arms and back were bare underneath the straps and buckles of a heavy leather smock. As I watched, his right hand, encased in a thick black glove, raised to shoulder height. The meat cleaver it held glistened from the process of his work. When the cleaver swiped down, quickly and expertly, upon his work on the table, the muscles in my own arm twitched empathically.

  *Thump* . . .  

  . . . followed by a sharp, splintering *crack*. He pulled a slick hank of meat from its place on the carcass and slid it to the side. It looked exactly like the hunk of meat that the cat had tried to wrestle out from under the side table.

 

  ""—*in direct violation of Tri-County processing and consumption laws*—""

 

  By touch, I switched off the Mag-Lite. I didn't need it anymore, and the echo of its beam formed a dull circle in the center of my vision. I blinked it away and then spotted the cat creeping toward the figure at the cutting table.

  She sprang up onto the metal corner.

 

  ""—*a mass grave containing no less than two dozen heads, accompanied by stripped bones baring the marks of systematic dismemberment and defleshing, along with burn patterns indicative of exposure to flame while still covered with flesh*—""

 

  Meowing, she reached out a paw to bat at the figure's shoulder.

  On the radio, the newswoman's voice was replaced by the slightly more pleasant, though equally no-nonsense-toned, voice of a man.

 

  ""*This is a public notice. LP foodstuff is available* legally *only from licensed providers*.""

 

  The figure at the cutting table placed the cleaver on the table, then turned to face the cat. His movements were slow, deliberate. The dim light of the room brought the striated flesh of his right cheek and arm into relief.

 

  ""*Purchase, production, and possession of LP foodstuff not approved by established local authorities will result in penalties*.""

 

  He turned and gazed at the cat for a moment. Then his arm—his butchering arm—began to rise toward the animal, who pawed playfully at it. He pulled the thick glove from his hand and reached around the back of the cat's head, the fingers closing.

""*Cat* . . ."" I tried calling, but my voice came out a dry whisper.

  The cat arched her back. The figure began to stroke her behind the ears. The cat—the same cat who had run and hid when strangers entered the house, who had hissed at and clawed and hated everyone in the world but me—rubbed her cheek up lovingly inside the figure's arm. Even from where I stood, I could hear her deep, devoted purrs.

 

  ""*These penalties may include fines, loss of all meal rights, loss of property, corporeal punishment, community expulsion, and summary execution*""

 

  The figure turned. He looked directly at me. The motion was deliberate, guided, as if he hadn’t needed to wonder whether or not I might be there or to search for me. But rather, he knew how to find me where I stood.

  Even with his face in full view, neither his age—the striations that crisscrossed his skin hid any crow's feet at the corners of his eyes or sags hidden in his jowls—nor his intention revealed themselves to me. My shock and the light from that four-crowned candle smothered everything except for those scars and the sharp, intelligent, and maybe somewhat wild gleam in his eyes.

  I stepped backward.

  He did not blink. He did not twitch.

  He simply sprang.

 

  ""*Public militia, local and county authorities thank you for your compliance and good citizenry*.""

 

  The hand that had been petting the cat, the hand that before had clenched a cleaver to butcher meat, was now stretched out toward me. He was heavier than I was, but there must have been tight muscles under that mass because his work boots clapped in quick succession across the concrete floor as he closed the distance between us. I heard his voice rise in a gravel baritone. The words, I fathomed only later.

  His movement revealed the work splayed across the stainless-steel surface of the cutting table. I saw what it was.

  I twisted to run. My shin barked into the coffee table. I pitched forward, sprawling, my knee coming down hard on the table's edge. The radio flopped face down. The candle rocked on its base. Liquid wax splashed in the melted divots. One after the other, the flames winked out. I scrambled for balance, jarring the table again with an elbow, causing the final flame to gutter. At that moment, I saw a second candle, superimposed over the first, occupying the exact same space. This one was shorter by half. It sported only one wick; all the others had burned away.

  The final flames of both candles guttered in precise tandem and winked out together.

  There's really not much else to tell after that. I scrambled around in the dark, expecting every second to deliver a pair of strong hands clasping my throat. When I found the Mag-Lite, I immediately swung it around like a club, hoping to bludgeon the attacker who was certainly mere inches away from my murder. And when it arched on thin air, I played its beam back and forth across the walls.

I found only my small, tidy living room, marked by a spilled, dead candle spreading chilled splashes of candle wax across the surface of my coffee table. There were no cutting tables in place of the kitchen table, no wheeled carts, no profane meats, and no freezers to preserve them.

  The cat hasn't come home in months. When I need evidence against my own doubts about what I experienced that night, I strike my lighter and hold the flame near one of the wicks of that four-crowned candle. I've never been able to bring myself to light it again.

  I will,l though, one day, I suppose. One day, when things have gotten so terrible, I'll start lighting each wick, one at a time—waste not, want not—and I'll let each burn down until there's only one left to light. I'll watch each burn, and I won't challenge them; I think I may hope for them to burn faster.

  I miss the cat. Stupid, and yet I do. But then we'll be seeing each other again, eventually.

  And I'll need her. When the time is at hand, I will need her to give me presence of mind because I will need to fight against panic and desperation.

  I will remember what the figure yelled as he lunged wildly at me, arms outstretched, hands clutching. But not for me.

  I must let his words echo in my head every day until I call those words myself:

But she was always kind of like that. Tightly wound, nervous, anxious, jumpy. Though this was…extreme, and just pretty freaking weird.  
  
By spring of 2023, her doctors diagnosed her with depression and told her to get out, be active, exercise.  
  
She came outside to swim with us one day, said she couldn’t remember how to get in the pool, and with a dead pan expression, asked me to push her into the deep end.  That was the moment I had to accept something was very wrong.    
  
I came to the conclusion that she was having a literal nervous breakdown. It was almost like she was faking all of this for attention, except she would never ever do that. She’s this quiet, empathetic person, who is always serving others and never wants the attention on her.  
  
So, I looked into SSRI toxicity, but that was a dead end. But I need answers when something doesn’t make sense!  
  
Christmas of 2023 to Winter of 2024 was a rapid decline. She’d had 2 fender-benders. Doctors said no more driving. When others were driving her and didn’t take the route she was used to, she’d freak completely out, shouting and pointing.  
  
She was having trouble completing basic tasks. Burned her famous apple pie. Couldn’t hang up her cell phone. Couldn’t spell her grandchildren’s names. No longer able to text. Couldn’t fill up the dog’s water bowl. Completely withdrew socially.  
  
Before all of this, she was the most mild-mannered, self-controlled person I had ever met. But by this point, when she couldn’t complete a basic task, she would yell a guttural scream and say SHIIIT. It was gut-wrenching and so scary.    
  
I couldn’t leave my kids alone with her anymore because she started getting physical with my 5 year old daughter when she wouldn’t sit still while getting her nails clipped.  
  
She became obsessed with checking the mail, hand picking lint out of the carpet, picking up sticks in the yard for hours and making little beaver piles everywhere (we live on a little bit of land and she lived in our lovely little garage apartment), getting weeds out of the driveway cracks, taking out the trash. She made me spend an entire day shopping for replacement trash cans because the ones we had were…""dirty"".   
  
The whole thing was like a bad episode of The Twilight Zone.  
  
End of Winter 2023 we finally got a diagnosis. FTD. Then we informally narrowed it down to kind of a mix of Progressive Non-Fluent Aphasia and Behavioral-Variant.   
  
By Spring of 2023, she had very few words left. Yes meant no and no meant yes. Most of the time she would just parrot back the words others were saying. Every waking moment she was AGITATED and emotional.  
  
My husband had to go up to make her coffee & breakfast and give her meds, I brought her lunch, then he took an evening shift.  
  
Social norms were out the window. She would spit out her food. She would shout in public. She was a danger to herself and we started seeing that she was no longer safe under our care alone.   
  
We brought in an incredible nurse and she ran her off within a week. It was bad.  
  
We hesitantly started looking into assisted living and during that time, she closed herself into my husband’s hot truck and couldn’t get out. She would have been dead within the hour if he hadn’t gone out and happened to find her within 20 very hot and I’m sure very scary minutes.  
  
May 2024 went to assisted living. She didn’t speak to anyone. Sort of walked around like a ghost. She only had about 10 words left at this point.  
  
Within 2 weeks, she’d lost ALL executive function. Couldn’t feed herself, shower alone, etc. She just sat and called everyone in her phone on repeat while pacing frantically 24/7.  
  
After a month or 2, her agitation got so bad that one day she ran around pulling all the fire alarms. The same day she found the head nurse and wrote, “HELP ME” in her notebook when she hadn’t been able to write for quite some time at that point. The next day, she attacked that same nurse by grabbing her arm and refusing to let her go. Her arm was bruised in the process of trying to get away as she followed her all the way down the hall before the nurse could get away. We were told she was a liability and had to go to a geriatric psych ward to get meds regulated. We had about 5 hours to figure the whole thing out.  
  
This, of all the decisions he had to make, nearly killed my husband. These places are awful and dirty and scary, and he had to leave with her banging on the door to get out.   
  
Two weeks stuck there.   
  
They prescribed Abilify. She became a total zombie. Falling down all the time. Shaking. Couldn’t walk. I thought she would be dead in another 2 weeks. I actually prayed for her to be able to die and not have to live one more day in that state.  
  
Shortly after being discharged, she went back to the hospital for a UTI and that doctor said Abilify is a big NO for dementia patients.  
  
Put her on a low dose of Seroquel and it was like…MAGIC.  
  
They’ve inched her up from 25mg to 175mg per day, which we support because she’s a danger to be around otherwise.  
  
With the agitation out of the way, she regained some executive function. She turns the lights on and off, regained a few words, will eat and can feed herself again.  
  
She still knows us. She smiles and hugs everyone. Sometimes she can sort of listen to a story. My husband puts little videos together for her and she’ll actually sit and watch those. She cried last week when her twin sister came to visit her. So though she doesn’t smile or engage exactly, she still FULLY understands what’s going on around her. She just can’t connect to her surroundings and doesn’t know how to operate within those surroundings. It's almost as if she's locked in her own mind.  But she does know what’s going on.  
  
She’s physically very fit now because she doesn’t overeat anymore and mostly paces all night long except for the 3 or 4 hours that she sleeps.   
  
So, with all that being said, I can accept things I can’t control (I mean, sort of). But I’m terrified this is something curable that most doctors don’t understand and have therefore just lumped under the dementia umbrella.  
  
I’m terrified she’s just trapped inside herself and there’s some key we’re missing that could bring her back.  
  
I know this is all TMI. But it’s therapeutic to share, and if any tiny detail might provide a clue to the possibility of any other logical explanation, then it’s worth a shot.  
  
Could this be a Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak? I read Dr. Wouter Schievink’s research which states that a significant number (43%) of behavior-variant FTD patients had a cerebrospinal fluid leak and when the leak was patched, the dementia symptoms reversed.   
  
She never had headaches or neck pain.  
  
Is this worth upsetting my MIL’s routine in order to conduct testing? I would imagine at this point it would require general anesthesia to get imaging. Is it worth getting my SIL’s hopes up if it will most likely lead to nothing?  
  
We’re in Houston, TX close to one of the greatest medical centers in the world. But I can’t find anyone who seems to be working on anything remotely close to the work that Dr. Schievink’s doing.  
  
I want to hear EVERY opinion, every random thought. Tell me I’m unrealistic, can’t put a sentence together, tell me I’m a total idiot. I don’t care. If I learn a single thing from this post, it’ll be worth it!  
  
I also still hold a tiny flicker of hope that this could all be a horrible, terrible nightmare that we’re going to wake up from soon because we’ll find that key that’s going to snap her out of it. So, thank you in advance for your contribution or consideration.",0,1746749487.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

## Key Features Analysis

The top marine power inverters of 2025 are expected to be packed with innovative features designed to improve performance, safety, and user experience.

**Pure Sine Wave Output:** This is perhaps the most critical feature to consider. Pure sine wave inverters produce AC power that is virtually identical to the power you get from a standard wall outlet. This is essential for sensitive electronics, such as laptops, televisions, and audio equipment, as they require a clean and stable power source to operate correctly. Modified sine wave inverters, while less expensive, can cause damage to these devices over time.

**High Surge Capacity:** A high surge capacity is necessary to handle the initial power draw of appliances with motors, such as refrigerators, microwaves, and power tools. the surge capacity refers to the inverter's ability to provide a short burst of power that is considerably higher than its continuous power rating. This allows the inverter to start these appliances without overloading and shutting down. A good marine power inverter should have a surge capacity that is at least twice its continuous power rating.

**Multiple Protection features:** Safety is paramount when dealing with electrical systems on a boat. Look for inverters that offer multiple protection features, including overload protection, over-temperature protection, short circuit protection, and reverse polarity protection. These features will help to prevent damage to the inverter, your boat's electrical system, and the appliances you are powering. Reverse polarity protection is especially crucial to prevent damage if the inverter is accidentally connected to the battery with the wrong polarity.

**Remote Control and Monitoring:** Many modern marine power inverters come with a remote control and monitoring panel. This allows you to monitor the inverter's performance, including input voltage, output voltage, and load, from a convenient location on the boat.Some models also allow you to turn the inverter on and off remotely, which can save battery power when the inverter is not in use.

**Conformal Coating:** Marine environments are notoriously harsh,with high humidity,salt spray,and temperature fluctuations. A conformal coating is a protective layer applied to the inverter's circuit boards to prevent corrosion and protect against moisture damage. This coating significantly extends the lifespan of the inverter and ensures reliable performance in demanding marine conditions.

**Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS):** Some inverters integrate an automatic transfer switch (ATS). This feature automatically switches between the inverter power and shore power when available. When shore power is connected, the ATS will disconnect the inverter and use shore power to power your appliances and charge your batteries. When shore power is disconnected, the ATS will automatically switch back to inverter power. This eliminates the need to manually switch between power sources and ensures a seamless power supply.

Key features of marine power inverters include:

* Pure sine wave output
* High surge capacity
* Multiple protection features
* Remote control and monitoring
* Conformal coating
* Automatic transfer switch

**Enhanced Convenience and Comfort:** A power inverter allows you to run a wide range of appliances and electronics, significantly enhancing your onboard living experience. You can power kitchen appliances like blenders and coffee makers, entertainment systems such as televisions and gaming consoles, and even essential medical equipment. This eliminates the need to rely solely on smaller,DC-powered devices or frequently run a generator.

**Silent Operation:** Unlike generators, inverters operate silently, providing a peaceful and relaxing onboard habitat. This is especially appreciated when anchoring in quiet coves or overnighting in marinas where generator noise is prohibited. The absence of noise pollution contributes to a more enjoyable and stress-free boating experience.

**Extended Battery Life:** high-quality inverters are designed to be energy-efficient, minimizing the drain on your boat's batteries. Advanced models often feature power-saving modes that further reduce energy consumption when no appliances are actively drawing power. This allows you to run appliances for longer periods without significantly depleting your batteries, extending your time away from shore power.

**Reduced Reliance on Generators:** By providing a reliable source of AC power, inverters significantly reduce your reliance on generators. This not only saves on fuel costs but also eliminates the need for regular generator maintenance and reduces the risk of mechanical breakdowns. This independence provides greater freedom and flexibility for extended cruising or living aboard.

**Increased Safety and Reliability:** Marine-grade power inverters are designed with multiple safety features to protect against electrical hazards. These features,such as overload protection,over-temperature protection,and short circuit protection,ensure the safe and reliable operation of your onboard electrical systems. This gives you peace of mind knowing that your appliances and electrical wiring are protected from damage.

## FAQs Section

**What size inverter do I need for my boat?**
The size of the inverter you need depends on the total wattage of the appliances you plan to run concurrently. Calculate the wattage of each appliance and add them together to determine the required inverter size. Be sure to account for the surge capacity of appliances with motors. It's also recommended to add a safety margin of 20-30% to the calculated wattage to ensure that the inverter is not overloaded.

**Can I connect multiple batteries to a single inverter?**
Yes, you can connect multiple batteries to a single inverter to increase the available power and extend the runtime. However,it is important to connect the batteries in parallel,which means connecting the positive terminals together and the negative terminals together. This will increase the amp-hour capacity of the battery bank while maintaining the voltage.

**How often should I maintain my marine power inverter?**
Regular maintenance is essential to ensure the reliable performance of your marine power inverter. Check the connections regularly for corrosion and ensure that the inverter is kept clean and dry. Avoid exposing the inverter to excessive moisture or temperature fluctuations. Consult the manufacturer's instructions for specific maintenance recommendations.

**What is the difference between a pure sine wave and a modified sine wave inverter?**
A pure sine wave inverter produces AC power that is virtually identical to the power you get from a standard wall outlet. modified sine wave inverters produce a more distorted waveform that can damage sensitive electronics. Pure sine wave inverters are more expensive but are essential for powering sensitive devices such as laptops, televisions, and audio equipment.

My parents made my oldest brother and sister the executives of their estate, and my father passed away 15 years ago, leaving my mom with a substantial amount of money. My oldest brother and second youngest sister have had control of the money for the last 15 years. They have helped themselves to huge amounts of money without letting the rest of us know. Just taking money when they pleased. My mother is now 94 with dementia (which she’s had for about 5 years) and a year ago, the money ran out and they (brother and sister involved) asked us all to contribute every month, which like a sucker I did. The sister that  helped herself to the money and dished out plenty of money to the brother, decided, after a year that she didn’t want to pay my mom’s monthly fee anymore, which really upset me as I’ve never had a cent over all these years. So I demanded to see bank statements for the prior three years and started seeing all these huge amounts of money that have been taken out by her and my brother. I asked for more bank accounts going back of further five years and so even more unknown large quantities of money just being taken and supposedly paid back. My brother was the worst and would just ignore me whenever I asked if certain monies were paid back. Finally, my oldest sister (one of the executors) got involved but used me as the one to communicate with them so now I’m the bad guy. The sister and the brother involved won’t talk to me and I get a yes, no answer every time I try and ask a question about certain accounts and monies. I’m now visiting my mother staying in a rented place for the next three weeks and the sister involved won’t talk to me or see me even though I’ve offered to have coffee. AITA for wanting to know what loans they’ve taken and how and if they repaid the loans? All the money the sister had borrowed/taken, she never paid a cent of interest. As a result of the plundering and pillaging of this account of my mother’s, they used up all my mom’s money. My dad was such a cautious man with his money. He saved and saved and saved, and the year after he died, my brother started taking money. Finally, when she (sister) knew she got busted for a loan that she took out and never repaid 9 years ago, she moved a lump sum back into the account and I’m no longer going to be having to pay every month because this should cover my mother for well over a year or two.

1ki4pr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1ki4pr2/determinism_is_just_a_disability_and_other_wet/,Determinism Is Just a Disability (and Other Wet Thoughts),"**Before I start reading Sapolsky’s Determined**, I wanted to write one last post — my own little act of free will, assuming such a thing exists. People keep telling me that free will is an illusion. That every choice is just the result of past causes, chemicals, genetics, and universal dominoes. But honestly?

Sometimes determinism feels like a worldview disability — like trying to experience life with one hand tied behind your brain.

Let me explain.

# 🖕 One-Sign Language Philosophy

Ever talk to a hardcore determinist? It’s like having a conversation in sign language where the only gesture they use is the middle finger. 🖕

No matter what you say — “What about love? Creativity? Deciding to jump in a puddle?” — the answer is always the same:

“Because... atoms.”

It's not that they’re wrong about cause and effect — it's just that their version of reality gets reduced to a single explanation. Like teaching someone who's deaf how to communicate... and only showing them one rude gesture. Not helpful. Kinda insulting. Definitely boring.

**A quick note before I dive in:**  
**I know calling determinism a “disability” is a clumsy and imperfect analogy. Real disabilities are not a joke — they’re lived experiences, not philosophical metaphors. I’m not trying to make light of anyone’s reality. I just wanted to illustrate how a rigid worldview can feel limiting, like trying to navigate with only part of the picture. If the metaphor offends or misses the mark, I sincerely apologize. My aim here is to explore ideas with humor and curiosity, not to punch down.**

# 🌀 The Puddle Test (a.k.a. 36-Year-Old Joy in a Parking Lot)

So here’s a real story.

The other morning, it was rainy. I was in a parking lot, about to enter a building. There was this medium-sized puddle right in front of me — nothing dramatic, just a decent splash zone.

I had options: walk around it, jump over it, ignore it. But standing about 15 feet away was an older man, quietly observing the world (or maybe just trying not to slip).

I decided to jump — not too hard — just a quick hop with my right foot straight into the middle of the puddle. No water touched him. That wasn’t my goal.

I just wanted to see his reaction.

He looked at me like I was a lunatic. He slowly shook his head, giving me that perfect “grown man doing puddle stunts” look. His silent judgment — his own personal sign language — was priceless.

And I laughed. So hard.

It made my whole day. Not because I was trying to be a clown — but because I realized how much joy there is in simply choosing to do something silly and watching how others respond.

Before I jumped, I had a full internal debate:  
Left foot? Right foot? How much splash? Should I splash him just a bit for fun?  
Nah — I’m polite. I’m not looking for trouble. But even after all that thought, he chose how to react. And I believe that was his decision.

If he’d been younger, would he have smiled instead? Maybe even jumped in too?

That moment reminded me that even the smallest actions carry infinite alternate storylines — depending on who’s watching, how they feel, and what perspective they bring.

# ☕️ The Coffee Shop & Butterfly Timelines

Another day, I’m at a coffee shop. I want a specific flavor, but they’re out. A minor inconvenience for most people — but for me? It launches a whole thought spiral.

Do I wait for a new batch to be brewed? Do I switch to another drink to save time? My brain weighs every angle, every variable. Time, mood, craving, energy, consequences.

That day, I decided to wait. I wasn’t in a hurry.

Ten minutes later, I leave the shop... and I get hit with this powerful déjà vu feeling. I see someone on the street — total stranger — and it just feels like we’ve crossed paths before. Strong enough that I say:

>

They say, “No.” And that’s fine. That’s not the point.

The point is that this moment only happened because of how I chose to act. If I’d gone with a different drink, I’d have left earlier. That person would’ve already passed by. No encounter, no déjà vu, no story.

Even deeper: maybe a month earlier, I had been in the same café. I didn’t wait. I was in a rush. I prioritized time over flavor. Maybe — just maybe — if I had waited that day and tried to make up time afterward, I’d have rushed across the street and been hit by a car.

And maybe — just maybe — the person I just locked eyes with today would’ve been the one driving.

So to me, that déjà vu was not magic. It was causal poetry. It was a ripple from a choice I didn’t make. A life I didn’t live.

From their perspective? They felt nothing. Just a guy looking at them funny in the street.

But that’s the beauty of it. We each live in our own timelines, shaped by our choices — or at least the illusion of them.

# 🤷‍♂️ What If It’s All Just Atoms?

Hard determinists would say none of this matters. That my puddle jump, my coffee decision, my déjà vu — all were inevitable, scripted before I was born. That my brain, my upbringing, my biology made these choices for me.

Maybe they’re right. Maybe I’m just reacting to causes like everyone else.

But... if we can’t know the script ahead of time — if we can only watch it unfold moment by moment — then what’s the point of saying it was all “set in stone”? If I can’t tell the ending without living the middle, then I might as well enjoy the middle.

# 🧢 Stay Curious, Splash Respectfully

So no, I’m not claiming to have the answers. And I’m not trying to disrespect determinists — I’m just poking fun at the idea that life can be boiled down to one formula, one signal, one finger.

Real life is messier than that. It’s parking lots, coffee delays, weird emotions, unexpected strangers, and head-shaking old men.

Maybe there is no free will. Maybe everything I just wrote was inevitable. But I still feel like I chose to jump in that puddle. I still laugh at the memory. And I still wonder what would’ve happened if someone else had jumped too.

**Now I’m off to finally read Determined and see what Sapolsky has to say. Maybe I’ll be convinced. Maybe not.**

Either way, I’ll be reading it with an open mind — and probably wet socks.

**Until then: jump in puddles, ask weird questions, splash respectfully. Whether it’s free will or fate — enjoy the ride.**",0,1746747777.0,freewill,13,0.43,False

what also bothers me is that i have mild hypothyroidism but my primary care doctor decided against treating it even though im experiencing all the symptoms(sensitive to cold, dry skin, muscle aches, fatigue, constipsation, etc.) it's unfortunate i don't have the funds to see an endocrinologist and i literally can't find any that my insurance accepts 😕

however im glad i finally got my official diagnosis so that maybe i can be taken more seriously. currently taking spironolactone and provera to hopefully induce a period. once i get my period, ill have to start birth control. the first time i took BC years ago i hated how it made me feel, but my obgyn gave me a low dose so hopefully this works out! i want to get better, lose weight, stop being tired and idk... just be a regular healthy person lol!

I’m a 30 male, had a situationship with a girl from work, different department. I don’t interact with her on a day to day basis but sometimes have group meetings where she’s involved.

The situationship happened about 6 months ago. We were in a meeting, she shared a fun fact and I happened to reach out to her after the meeting and that’s where we started to converse more. 
It started with us pretty much conversing daily, she was in a relationship but was very lonely. I was single and super lonely, so our conversations were great. One day we met outside of work and she told me she was growing feelings for me and didn’t see me as a coworker anymore but couldn’t move forward because of the relationship she was in. I understood where she was coming from and we decided to stop conversing daily. 2 weeks later she reached out again and said she missed our conversations and could not stop talking to me.

After about a month talking to one another and going on coffee runs each morning before work, we started to see each other more after work. I would go to her neighborhood and we would walk her cute dog. Sometimes we would eat dinner together before I headed home. Things escalated very quickly and before you know it we were kissing, going on dates and having intercourse. Pretty much acting like a couple but without the title. This all happened while still was in a relationship. She would always talk about how bad this guy would treat her and how they’ve been together for years and knew each others family, so that was a big reason why she didn’t want to break it off.

Few weeks went by and one day she told me she had broke up the relationship. We hanged out that day, she seemed a bit upset but after hanging out together it was back to us acting like a couple. 

This went on for a few weeks when one day she told me that we were not compatible, which kind of broke me since I was really into this woman. We haven’t talked since then. Now I just feel used. I feel I was just someone that assisted in her finally breaking free from her ex. I found her on bumble shortly after so that made me even more upsetting. Made me feel like I was not enough.

It’s been around 6 months now and I can’t forget about this girl. I’ve tried to move on but I don’t know why she’s always there, in every thought. I know it’s dumb and stupid but I can’t help and think if she misses me, if she’ll reach out again one day. I don’t see the reason of me reaching out out since she’s the one that told me we weren’t compatible. I feel like I’m just waisting my time and not living but just existing, but it’s so hard to move on.

To work on astringency and increase strength, I may change my brew ratio from 1:17 to 1:15. To note, I am sticking to swirling to ensure an even bed, and am not attempting to change agitation beyond that.

  
Edit: I just brewed another cup, with a 1:15 ratio. Astringency is massively reduced. There's no sign of the woody bitterness going away, so it seems this is best enjoyed after cooling massively. It is a very smooth cup now, with a level of astringency that is low enough that I doubt I can cut it out more practically. It seems like the woody bitterness before moderate warmth is unavoidable with the strength of cup I like. I feel like that old 75 grind setting reduced the strength too much for me, even though it did seemingly cut that bitterness. As of now, I feel like I must've reached 80% of the possibility with this bean after cutting astringency. maybe I'll mess around a bit more to make sure that I don't have any confirmation bias here, but I think I've reached a good cup.",0,1746747316.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

ANGLE: Amanda looks at her screen. It’s filled with incomprehensible stenotype.

She scrolls—line after line of it. No memory. No translation. She slams the laptop shut.

H steps into frame, hand to her forehead. Concerned.

1ki4a67,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1ki4a67/theyve_been_fighting_for_years_and_its_reaching_a/,They've been fighting for years and its reaching a breaking point.,"Let me introduce my three cats. Henry (M—11y) is shelter cat whom we adopted when he was one year old, shortly before rescuing a new kitten, Autumn (F—10y). Henry practically raised Autumn. They were best friends and neither had behavioral issues.

Then came Nyx (F—7). We also rescued Nyx off of the streets as a kitten, about 3 years after adopting Autumn. The two hated each other from the get-go. Nyx is a highly anxious cat who's anxiety has no doubt been exacerbated by being bullied by Autumn ever since we brought her home. Autumn's behavior also worsened when Henry began to care for and play with Nyx the same way he did for Autumn back in the day. At the time, we didn't know how to properly introduce our cats, and though we've tried to re-introduce them several times over the years, their dynamic has never changed.

Eventually, both of the girls stopped playing with Henry entirely, and it's around this time that he began to have some behavioral issues of his own. When he was around 5 years old, he started to spray in places around the house and we haven't been able to get him to stop or find the source of this behavior since. It should be noted that my family doesn't have a lot of money and I can't beg my mom into taking any of our cats to the vet unless something is very visibly wrong with their health, so I don't have the benefit of testing him for any health issues. However, in the past, the vet has suggested that he may have a urinary tract issue and recommended putting him on a prescription diet that, for several reason that I won't get into, is not an option.

I do believe that the vet's theory is very plausible, and as I understand it, these conditions can be HEAVILY influenced by stress, which makes sense to me. We actually ended up trying a stress relieving defuser recommended to us, but it was not effective. What I'd like to do is reduce possible sources of stress and give him more stimulation, but that is becoming increasingly impossible to do since we moved from our single family home to a 3 bedroom apartment last year. In such a tight space and without the ability to go outside anymore, the girls' fighting has reached a head, and Nyx has basically been completely isolated to the living room and office by Autumn. She doesn't use her cat trees anymore and spends half of her day hiding under the coffee table and growling and swiping at Autumn whenever she passes by, which makes playing with any of the cats excruciatingly difficult. As if playing in a tiny living room wasn't hard enough, I have to lock each one of them up for any one of them to get in any real playtime, which takes half of our energy for playing with them out of us alone. 

Our influence aside, however, since being shoved into such a cramped space with less territory to claim, the girls relationship is just getting worse and worse to the point that they're legitimately taking out their aggression on Henry and getting upset at him for even occupying the same space as them. I wholeheartedly believe that their hostility toward each other alone is causing him a significant amount of stress, but I have no idea how in the world to fix their relationship for the sake of each of their healths and qualities of life. We've tried all the Jackson Galaxy shit, we've tried the positive association—hell, we had them separated for a whole 8 months when we were in-between houses and tried reintroducing them the correct way when we moved into our current place. Nothing works.

It seem as if the only resources or advice anybody has is about how to introduce cats who are just meeting each other, but how do you get a territorial prick and a hyper sensitive ball of anxiety to get along after they've been fighting for 7 years?? I'm on the verge of tears writing this because I know that all of them are suffering while I just sit here and watch them. I'm at my wits end. I don't know what to do.",1,1746746504.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

Question: How much prep is enough for you personally? Where do you draw the line i.e. I feel safe enough with the current amount of prep given the current-state-of-affairs/stage-in-life/etc.?

The reason for asking is a recent IRL encounter with a prepper for the first time. I had gotten done with shopping at Costco, and was putting groceries in the car. An older guy was doing the same next to me, and he started talking to me. We chit-chatted about random things until he brought up the current India-Pakistan conflict. Then I noticed the stuff he had bought and everything was in bulk... toilet paper, paper towels, water, coffee, and etc. He started talking about how we need to take care of ourselves, and our families... when things go south then people are going to come to take it and etc. I asked him the same question that I am asking here but I never got the answer from him. Instead of answering he kept going off on tangents about various things regarding doomsday/faith and etc and I just gave up.

Hence, asking the similar question here.

I never had terrible periods as a teenager. At 22 I got the copper IUD and I’ve loved it, no issues at all with it. 

I’ve started getting regular UTI’s over the past 3 years, anywhere from 2 to 7 a year. I saw a Urologist. My ultrasound KUB was normal. I cut out coffee, alcohol, consumed 2 litres of water daily, changed to all cotton underwear, prophylactic antibiotic tablet post coitus, tried D-Mannose tablets, prebiotics etc, etc. You name it, I’ve tried it. Just to mention also, most of my urine results came back positive for growth. Although some didn’t seem to show that infection was there.

Then came the gynaecological complaints! Over the past year or two I experienced a couple of very bad periods but the symptoms were never consistent so I dismissed it. 

However in January this year I noticed severe cramping pain and bleeding in the middle of my cycle (unrelated to my period). So I made an appointment with my primary care doctor and got a Gynaecology referral.

Since January 2025, my symptoms ramped up significantly. Pain for many days a month, where over the counter pain relief was not relieving it, significant bleeding, and the worst? Stabbing pain during penetrative sex. I’ve never experienced pain like it.

I eventually saw a Gynaecologist last week after 5 months of pain and bleeding during my cycle (unrelated to my period).

I expected to have to fight for an ultrasound at least but lo and behold, he immediately booked me in for a laparoscopy as he is convinced I have endometriosis.


All of this to say, does anyone else have similar symptoms of recurrent UTI’s with a history of endometriosis? ",1,1746746000.0,endometriosis,1,1.0,False

I'm struggling to decide which coffee machine to pick to replace my current Breville/Sage Express.

I any case, the steaming power is really important for me

\- The Rancilio Silva Gaggiuino mod is nearly perfect but still a single boiler  
\- The Pro X is missing pressure control : I can't find any gaggiuino mod for the X pro unfortunately, to control the shot pressure  
\- Appartamento TCA with flow control mod : still single boiler, what about back-to-back ?

Is there a better choice ? Not huge fan of Profitec nor Lelit, but if the Bianca is the only option let me know your thoughts.

Thank you for your help :)

As mentioned in the title we are both classmates in uni and see each other semi often. We also shared a few of the  same friends and I see her in a few coffee shops I personally frequent.

As you can imagine the circumstances make it really awkward during lectures and being around the same friends and colleagues. We don't talk at all, rarely even say hi. Personally it started to upset me recently because at this point the intimate feelings have subsided and I just miss the person I enjoyed spending time with, playing games, studying etc. And the weird energy is getting annoying, I feel like I get along with everyone but when it comes to her I feel guilty in an odd way. Hate the elephant in the room when I'm with my class during break time.

The reason why I think I feel guilty and maybe a bit upset is that during the breakup she did say some pretty hurtful things that I felt were untrue for example that she felt that I didn't care enough about our relationship. Which I wanted to argue that I very much did, but decided that it's better to leave it and to peacefully separate on her terms.

I first thought that since she's the one who decided to end our relationship she's the one who can reconnect whenever she felt comforfable. During the breakup we did talk about possibly staying as friends.

It's been a few months now and zero progress has been made so. I'm not sure how to proceed.
