1po0obv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NoPalpitation3820/comments/1po0obv/how_can_some_people_be_so_shitty_my_ex_was_dating/,How can some people be so shitty? My ex was dating an old friend of mine while I thought we were mutually exclusive and working on things.,"
I 27M was dating 25F for 5 months when she dumped me. I made a previous post about the break up scenario. This was in October and the original post was after she asked me to leave but she officially said she couldn’t do this anymore in the middle of October. I had acknowledged that other pretty women exist but expressed I had no desire to peruse anyone but her. She said she couldn’t get over me finding other women were pretty. Some of the comments said she was just looking for an out and that’s what she chose. And it appears they were right because she wanted someone else. Not just anyone else but my old friend and gym buddy.

I was trying to be understanding of her past trauma with being cheated on multiple times and was trying to find solutions to fix what we had. Because she made me believe I was the problem. We had been on and off talking and seeing each other since the break up and I thought we were making progress in me getting her back.

Well when I went over to her place Sunday night found out the truth. She had been sketchy and seemed like she was hiding something so when she went to the bathroom I opened her phone. Found someone saved as 🥰 and as soon as I opened the text chain the only thing I could see was a breakup text and she came out of the bathroom.

She had told me she wasn’t seeing anyone and no one else had been at her place. So I confronted her about it and she proceeded to fabric this elaborate lie about meeting someone at school through a mutual friend and that it was just talking and nothing physical ever happened. She swore. It was hard to swallow but technically we were broken up and it was supposedly just talking so I didn’t leave. Although we were not supposed to be seeing anyone else, I needed answers. 

When she went to sleep I opened it again and found out that just 2 weeks after dumping me she had gotten 🥰 number. Me her and 🥰 all work together. 🥰 and I used to be friends till I found out he was a bad drunk and just not a great dude. So I really only went to the gym with him. Until I started seeing her and was going home with her just about every night after work instead of the gym.

All of November basically they were talking and dating in secret. Had him coming to her place all while I was trying to get back with her and she was letting me believe we were making progress.

When we were still dating she expressed being upset that he didn’t want to talk to her at work. She said it was about not feeling like she was fitting in. Not a lot of people talked to her because someone SA’d her by grabbing her ass on her previous shift before she came to ours and she went to Hr and they got fired. You know how rumors go. But I trusted her so I believed her that it was just about fitting in and I didn’t care who she talked to because we went home together almost every night. I should have seen it coming and I didn’t.

This bitch was dating him within 2 weeks of dumping me. And a week after that telling him she loved him and had him staying at her place on and off. All the while still talking to me and leading me on. Using me as comfort and inviting me over when they would get in a spat I guess. I feel stupid, hurt, angry, and embarrassed.

When I found out I was livid and took the laptop I was letting her use for school, the nice coffee maker I bought, and the TV I put in her living room while she was asleep. I was in a bad headspace and I texted her aunt who is like her mom off her phone to let her know what kind of piece of shit my ex is. Not my proudest moment but I’m not the type to take my anger out physically on a woman and that seemed like decent revenge in the moment I guess.

She was my first love and now she is the one who gave me trauma. My first time trusting a woman and it completely blew up in my face. I feel sick. Can’t sleep for shit. And I have to see both of them at work every day.

How can someone be just such an awful person? Like who does this shit to someone they say they love. How do you get over something like this happening to you?",1,1765888015.0,u_NoPalpitation3820,0,1.0,False

We’re both autistic, so we tend to be very direct with each other and understand things like needing space, being blunt, and occasionally pulling back socially.

About five years ago or so, Kate had a big falling out with our shared friend group, her roommate, and her boyfriend at the time. She completely cut contact with them, and they no longer speak to her. I still have occasional contact with them. I might get a text or an invite to a holiday party or life event one to three times a year. Once in a while I’ll hang out with them, but often I don’t, because even though I crave connection, I also get socially overwhelmed due to my autism.

Recently, I was invited to that friend group’s Christmas party, but I ended up not going because I wasn’t feeling well. Earlier that same day, Kate ran into her ex at a coffee shop. He mentioned the party, and later Kate asked me about it. I told her I had been invited and might attend, but I wasn’t sure.

Kate got upset that I hadn’t told her about the invitation ahead of time. I explained that in the past she’s had angry reactions when I mention contact with them, and I didn’t want to stress her out or create conflict. She said I should have told her so she could decide how she whether she still wants to be friends with me. She believes that me talking to or spending time with people who hurt her shows that I don’t care about her and that I value partying, drinking, and casual friendships more than her. She states she's not telling me who I can or can't hang out with, but it kind of feels like she is??? 

AITHA here?? 

I can struggle with understanding healthy communication or friendships because of my autism, so I'm looking for honest and blunt feedback here...even if it's telling me I'm the A-hole. ",1,1765887966.0,AmItheAsshole,1,1.0,False

* Plan your study schedule before the week starts. I spent an hour last sunday mapping out which exams are when and what topics I need to cover for each.
* Prioritize based on exam weight and your current grade not all finals are created equal. If you're already doing well in one class and another could make or break your grade, focus more energy there.
* Use active recall instead of just rereading notes, instead of reading my notes over and over, I close them and try to write down everything I remember and check what I missed.
* Study with people who are serious group study only works if everyone's actually there to work.
* Try different focus tools that aren't just coffee until you find the one that works for you, I was drinking like 4 cups a day and felt terrible, now I’m using gray matter, theanine, and bizz gum and it's helping me like none other, also a ton of water.
* Learn \*\*\*\*when to stop studying there's a point where you're just staring at the page and nothing's going in, when you hit that wall, just stop.
* Take care of the basics shower, eat real meals, get some sunlight. I know it sounds like parent advice but when you feel like a human being you study better.

The goal is to make it through without needing a week to recover and be able to study for the next test and not need recovery from one to another, you got this. Any other tips?",1,1765887939.0,Student,0,1.0,False

1po0i2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1po0i2z/aspiration_station/,Aspiration Station,"
Derek felt a rush of giddy anticipation as the TOR browser blinked to life. It never disappointed him. There was always something waiting, something grotesque, something to drown himself in. He told himself it was research and curiosity, but really, it was hunger. Tonight he wanted to go deeper, past the surface weirdness into whatever lay below. Some of his most memorable nights had been spent, as he liked to joke, *“touring the sights.”*

As usual, he made his way to the *taxi*, hoping to find something new. For the better part of an hour, he scrolled and scrolled. He thought he *had* failed when suddenly he found *Aspiration Station: Your new one stop shop for Murder.*

Now, Derek was a miscreant by all definitions, but murder was a whole different world. He valued light larceny, burglary, even a little auto theft, but he never could stomach blood. He had spent several weeks locked up because of his last stunt and was genuinely sorry for it. That little old lady didn't deserve to get punched just because she scared him while he dug through her jewelry box.

He would like to think it took him some time, a little soul searching, before he decided to step into the *Station.* In reality, it was only seconds.

He was met with a standard dark web site: black background with a chain link fence transposed sloppily, neon red and green buttons, half blurred pictures of... something. The usual. What was different was the chat box.

Before he could really take it all in, the box expanded, and someone with the username *GrinningGutter* began typing.

***GrinningGutter***: Welcome initiate. Please stand by while matchmaking takes place.

Derek felt elation. Was this some kind of game? He intended to find out. While waiting, he browsed some of the options the site had. There was an image board titled *Sliced Mice,* each thumbnail blurred and twitching as if alive. Another section was labeled *Dynamo Dynamics,* which appeared to be an odd leader board with monthly rankings. The usernames were blurred, with a flashing icon stating, ""Unlock NOW for just .00359 Bitcoin!"". It was all a bit strange, but then, what on the dark web wasn't?

Suddenly, the chat box blipped once more.

***GrinningGutter***: Match found! Enjoy.

But nothing else happened.

Derek felt the crash coming. He had all but moaned with satisfaction when he thought something new would happen. Now it felt like just another site made to rake in easy Bitcoin, nothing more. He was about to admit defeat when he saw a flashing banner, rhythmically pulsing away at the bottom of the screen. Curiosity killed the cat. He hoped he would fare better than that dumb cat. Happily, he clicked it.

To his utter delight, another chat box blipped open.

***ImInURhouse***: Hello.

Derek made to reply, but was stopped behind another pay wall, this time in bright green, flashing ""Trial over, to continue, SIGN UP NOW"".

It was obvious now, how could he reply without a username? Daunting as it seemed, what was a slice of Bitcoin for a little late-night fun? Yet again, he clicked, only to be faced with a rather lengthy sign up contract. It was grueling, but thankfully didn't require personal information. After a time, he was back at the chat box.

***5FingerDizcount***: Sup!

It sat that way for some time. One minute turned to two, then five. After nearly fifteen minutes he finally got a reply.

***ImInURhouse***: New?

***5FingerDizcount***: Yea, aren't you? And what is this site? Some kind of gore house for creeps?

***ImInURhouse***: Not so much. Last partner was no fun. Had to cut him lose. And no, it pairs you with a new friend. Together you can learn all sorts of new things. How to really have fun.

***5FingerDizcount***: Well, what kind of fun are you looking for? I'm ready for some fun.

***ImInURhouse***: You'll scratch an itch. Just play along.

Derek was a little confused. He knew people online loved to roleplay, but this guy was boring. Maybe he should move on. Just as he was about to head back to *taxi*, his monitor froze. Now, Derek wasn't just a nobody. He knew to have everything squared away and safe before running TOR, so this had to be a fluke. He went to shut the computer down and step away, but decided to leave it up. When he woke up he may watch a movie, and boot up times sucked.

As he got up and went to bed, he didn't notice the script box running on his desktop.

\---

Derek sighed and slumped into his chair. Another lousy night on the town left him with a cut hand and nothing but pocket change to show for it. The car he’d picked looked promising, but the guy was either renting it or wisely kept valuables elsewhere. Once again, the direction of his mood hinged on the dark web. He knew he was becoming a junkie. Knew it, but didn't care. The screen was always waiting, eager to soothe his needs.

As he flicked his mouse to wake the pc, a strange knot of apprehension built in his gut. He tried to search for a reason why, but when none came, he happily resumed.

Instantly, *Aspiration Station* blinked to life. That gave him pause, but he was jonesing. Briefly, he explored the site more. The paywall still blocked him from seeing other users, but the pictures were un-blurred. Just as he began to look through them, the chat box returned.

***ImInURhouse***: Rough night?

***5FingerDizcount***: Was it ever. Bad day all around. No one makes it easy these days.

***ImInURhouse***: Isn't that the best? The thrill of the game. Almost makes me teary-eyed, if I could cry.

Derek frowned, wondering what this strange person meant. Everyone could cry. Hell, he’d cried after spending a week in the slammer for blowing up those mailboxes. The threat of federal charges made him steer clear of anything mail related after that.

***5FingerDizcount***: Well, this is fun, but I think I wanna find something to get into. May come back here later, bye.

Derek mulled it over. He wanted to go back out. Someone had to have something lying around he could snag. Just as he sent the message and reached for the power button, the chat box blipped again.

***ImInURhouse***: NOT SO FAST. I have an idea for some real fun.

Derek bit

***5FingerDizcount***: Oh yea? Hit me, crybaby.

***ImInURhouse***: Want to play a game? It's simple. I ask five questions. You answer them. Then, you ask five and I'll answer. Simple enough for someone like you. Wouldn't you agree?

***5FingerDizcount***: Sure. No weird shit though.

***ImInURhouse***: What is the next line in the phrase ""Peekaboo...""?

***5FingerDizcount***: Huh?

***ImInURhouse***: ANSWER THE QUESTION

Derek hesitated before he replied.

***5FingerDizcount***: I see you... What kind of question is that?

***ImInURhouse***: Not your turn. What would you do for a chance to make history?

***5FingerDizcount***: I don’t know. Depends on what you mean.

***ImInURhouse***: Think. What would you risk to leave a mark?

Derek hesitated. This was no simple question. It was testing him, probing for the dark corners he usually kept buried. A part of him wanted to scoff, to type something flippant. But another part, the part that craved thrill, leaned in.

***5FingerDizcount***: I’d… I’d do what it takes.

***ImInURhouse***: Spoken like a true pariah. Now, say I had a score lined up, something lucrative. Would you want in?

***5FingerDizcount***: Listen man, you're kind of creeping me out. I love money just as much as the next guy, but why do you think I'm into scores?

Derek sent the message, then realized he'd asked another question out of line. Not that he really cared, but he didn't feel like being talked down to by some dark web flop who enjoyed role playing as a creep. He decided to cut out for real if that was how it would go down.

***ImInURhouse***: Ah, playing hard to get. No worries. I've almost been sated. Just do me a favor. Keep this tab open. I'm working on something big. May need a partner. We can meet up in a public place if you'd like, talk it over. Sound good?

Derek had to admit, he needed something big. Having struck out the past few nights, he was open to just about anything. Only, there were a few problems.

***5FingerDizcount***: Listen man, I'm not about to tell you where I live. For all I know, you could be a million miles away anyways. Chats been fun, but I'm gonna head to bed.

***ImInURhouse***: I'm south of Cleveland, near Parma. I'm sure you can make it.

Now Derek felt… excitement. Fear. Both. He lived in Parma. This was too good to be true. A new thought popped in his head. Was he talking to a chatbot? Something designed to draw people to the site, get them to pay some Bitcoin and waste time.

***5FingerDizcount***: I read somewhere that bots have to admit they are bots when asked. are you a bot? Cause if so I'm done here, unless you can point me to some good places to rob.

Derek sent this message and chuckled to himself. If it was a bot, maybe it would spew some small business names from the area that he could case. At least then he could recover some joy tonight.

***ImInURhouse***: Ah, I've been discovered. Yes, I am bot57. And since you asked, I have just the place! Come back in a few for details.

Before Derek could reply, the chat box flickered, the site vanished, and TOR crashed to his desktop. The abruptness gave him a jolt. He stared at the screen, half-expecting it to come back. When it didn’t, frustration welled up, then quickly faded into a restless buzz.

Maybe it was for the best. Maybe it wasn’t. Either way, he told himself, it was high time he went out and made something of himself.

\---

Four days later, Derek trudged up the stairwell to his apartment, each step echoing like an accusation, and fumbled with the lock until his knuckles ached. Tonight had been one long misfire. He'd scoped a tattoo parlor earlier, watched the owner round the corner and then chickened out when a kid on a skateboard started yelling at a dog. He'd tried to bluff his way into a secondhand shop with a story about being an inspector, but the owner had squinted at him and closed the door in his face without a second thought. By the time he finally shuffled into his apartment, the cheap thrill had curdled into embarrassment. He dumped his jacket and sat on the edge of his bed. Silence pressed in until he laughed, low and humorless, promising himself tomorrow would be smarter.

Tonight he planned on binging some *Sopranos* and eating pizza. After such a bust, he'd have to settle for cold cuts. He idled over to his desk and swept a pile of eviction notices into a trash bin. His luck was wearing out. Any day he'd be tossed to the streets. No good. Just as depression started the settle, he noticed the *Aspiration Station* chat box, pulsing with an urgency. Maybe his luck was about to change.

***ImInURhouse***: Suggested engagement: Marigold Antiques, Third and Linden. High foot traffic, late deliveries, lucrative occasional pickups. Human confirmation required for further details.

Derek blinked. Marigold was a name he did not know, but Third and Linden was in his part of town. The words lucrative and pickups skated by the edges of his greed. It sounded like a bot trying to sound human but failing badly, and that failure made him laugh.

***5FingerDizcount***: Never heard of it but I know the spot. What makes is lucrative?

***ImInURhouse***: High income records. Closes at 6 PM. No one watches it. Plus, it is a back street business. Plenty of cover.

Derek looked at the clock, and began preparing immediately.

\---

Derek was thrumming with elation. Not only had that stupid AI led him to a literal goldmine, but he had been successful. Just like it said, no one was around. When he busted in the back door, no alarm went off. The cherry on top had been all that lay in wait. The owners had no safe, so any cash was left in a small wooden box under the counter. It was full. Aside from cash, he found old jewelry, silver, and certified coins. His backpack was heavy enough to make him grin with every step, each jingle and clink sounding like proof that maybe, just maybe, his luck had turned.

The bot, he thought, deserved some kind of award for ""Best Source for Chaos"", or something to that measure. Derek didn't care what happened the rest of the night, he just knew that he was going to put the bot to work. If it could feed him one score, it could feed him ten. He pictured himself on a run of easy hauls, each one bigger than the last, like the start of some half-baked legend.

He hummed along to some half remembered tune as he all but skipped up the stairs. When he unlocked the door, his hands didn't fumble. Most nights he bore the damage of a failed break-in or a lost fight. Tonight, he was a king.

As he pushed the door closed behind him, he glanced around. First, he needed to stash his haul. He usually kept it all in a shoebox under his bed. That, in itself, proved how little he managed to take. This haul would need an upgrade. He decided to worry about that tomorrow when he noticed... something.

A steaming coffee cup sat on his desk. Derek didn't *own* a coffee maker, much less drink the stuff. Instant panic set in as he glanced around.

He approached his desk, head on a swivel as the screen lit up with a new message. The coffee cup sat forgotten as he slid into his chair and saw:

***ImInURhouse***: How was it?

Relief hit him, as he figured the message must have activated it somehow.

***5FingerDizcount***: You are amazing bot! You gotta give me more. A few licks like that and I can catch up on rent!

***ImInURhouse***: Yes, that bag does look heavy. How quick would you want another?

***5FingerDizcount***: As soon as you can! I needed this. And what, it cost me hardly anything. Get to work bot! Scram, move, skedaddle. I'd be game for another tonight.

***ImInURhouse***: Not so fast. I want to play my game again. Before you resist, know this; by the time we are done, you'll never have to worry about finding a score again. Sound good?

***5FingerDizcount***: Fuck it. Let's play. Make it quick.

***ImInURhouse***: What was the first question I asked you?

***5FingerDizcount***: Something about Peekaboo

***ImInURhouse***: Say Peekaboo for me. Say it out loud. Feel it against your tongue.

***5FingerDizcount***: Why would I do that. I've said it before, probably, when I was a kid. It's just a word bot. You're weird, just give me another lead.

***ImInURhouse***: SAY IT.

Derek sighed with frustration. He thought, why not. It is promising another score. As he leaned back in his chair, he said, ""Peekaboo.""

Silence.

In addition, they also work as a co-performer for you, are your camera person and photographer, handle the editing and posting of all content as well as miscellaneous work/assistant tasks like washing lingerie/toys, tech support, and coffee/water runs while you are on stream.  Assume they are also competent in providing mental/emotional support in general and specific to sex work.  Your SW friends cannot believe how supportive a partner you have, and are jealous/gush about how lucky you are.  Their estimated income opportunities for jobs outside of sex work top out at a max of $1200/week working 40-60+ hours and are unable to do all of the above for you while working these hours outside of the home.

I am curious about whether I am too hard on myself and my partner (while I am happy other women make bank, I am also jealous/upset I don't rake in 100k a month), or if other people at my income level also have a full-time business partner.

1po0gwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtarashiiGakko/comments/1po0gwu/i_randomly_met_kinda_mizyu_after_their_yokohama/,I randomly met (kinda) Mizyu after their Yokohama Christmas Market appearance,"It's been a few weeks now since this happened and tbh i need to tell the world as it's eating me alive lol (it's nothing spectacular, just a cool coincidence)

I randomly went to Yokohama without knowing AG were appearing at Yokohama's Christmas market. Once i got there, the queue for the market was soo massive, i just decided to hang out outside the market with hopes that maybe i'll catch a glimpse of them after.

And that I did! They left out a back entrance where i happened to be chilling on a bench eating a sandwich - it completely caught me off guard as they literally stepped out right in front of me and walked past just as some lettuce was falling out my stunned mouth.

They were whisked away quickly to a big red brick building thingy and i just sat there in shock. I saw big van/taxis waiting so i assumed they left straight away and that was that.

About 5 or 10 mins later, i went into a little coffee shop to get a mocha. Baring in mind i'd assumed they'd left, i was doubly as shocked to see Mizyu waltz in behind me into the coffee shop, dressed in a incognito hood and even more shockingly, without her tails!

For some reason, i tried to play everything as cool as possible and ordered my mocha like Mizyu wasn't standing there waiting in line next to me. I moved along and looked over to confirm - yes, she is even more pretty in real life!

Anyway, i waited for my coffee trying my best not to look over too much and be awkward - i think trying not to be awkward then ruined any of my confidence to talk to her, but it also felt like she was in sort of a rush, and i didn't wanna be an annoyance.

I got my coffee and walked out, sitting down instantly, knowing I had to go back and say SOMETHING to her. I formulated a plan to go back in, get some milk and say something cool like ""oh by the way, i love your music"", but after grabbing the milk, all i said was ""is this milk?"" to the cashier - idk how i fumbled this so hard, Mizyu was literally like 20cm away from me at this point, very much watching me awkwardly ask ""is this milk"".

I then panicked and went to the door to leave, opening it with my back so i could get one last glimpse - she was looking back at me so we had a bit of a weird like eye contact?? I then asked her if she was leaving (like holding the door open for her as she was kinda moving my way), but she said no don't worry and smiled, so i smiled back and left.

And after that, i was just in insane amounts of shock, sipping on my mocha staring into the distance.

I went back into the coffee shop later to throw away my trash, and the cashier girl and i went crazy lmao - apparently Suzuka came in just after i left too, which i was gutted to miss, but Mizyu's my favourite so that was more improtant to me!

I just wish i said something, anything at all - anyway, sorry for ramblimg but i had to get this off my chest😂",4,1765887352.0,AtarashiiGakko,0,1.0,False

Alarm buzzes, and bam—I'm elbow-deep in my phone, ""just checking emails,"" but really it's cat videos and regret. Turns out, that's the habit loop doing its shady thing, like some old friend who crashes your couch and eats all your chips. Cue hits (that damn alarm), routine kicks in (grab the phone), and reward? A quick dopamine buzz that leaves me feeling... bleh. Duke folks say up to 40% of our day runs on this autopilot crap—scary, right? I mean, I was deep in it a couple years back, chasing every shiny self-help thing, only to flame out by taco Tuesday.
Anyway, here's the bit that maybe saved me: Don't smash the loop head-on, or you'll just end up pissed and scrolling harder. Swap it out, gently. I stuck a ridiculous fridge magnet right by my coffee maker—""Eyes off screen, brain on""—made the cue impossible to ignore. Started with one tiny routine: Swap the scroll for a 30-second stretch, reward myself with that first hot sip feeling like victory. First few days? Awkward as hell, like dancing at a funeral. But by week two, I was actually brushing my teeth without the zombie stare. On the flip side, some loops are stubborn—like my late-night snack raids—but hey, progress over perfection, yeah?

**Memory Transcription Subject: Halin. Venlil Manager for Little Branson.** 

**Date: \[Standardized Human time\] February 24, 2138**

I awake to the most gentle shake I think is possible. My eyes creak open to see a very lovely face staring down at me as her tail wags forcefully behind her. She’s saying something, but my brain is taking an unusually long time to boot up into a usable state. The less I focus on her face, the clearer her words become.

“Come on, Halin! We need to get to work; the bathroom is open for you.”

I steal a glance at my pad charging on the bedstand and then back to Tiltva. And then back to the pad, and then back to Tiltva. Her tail stops dead in its tracks as I try to form a whole entire sentence.

“Tiltva, it’s only 5:30 a.m. Little Branson Time. Breakf-***irst*** meal with Ray and Thyla isn’t until 8 a.m.”

“W-well, it’s not a bad thing to be ready when the car gets here, right? I-I just think you-we should be ready early this paw.”

*Woah, this is a weird version of anxious Tiltva. What is… wait, is she wearing fur brightener? What is she so styled up for?*

“Ooookay… I’ll get going then.”

Her tail resumes its wagging as she *skips* out of my room back into the hallway. Giggling to myself over the strangely excited Tiltva, I slide myself off of the bed and shuffle out of my room to the bathroom. Like I expect, the air is still steamy from her routine, and I gladly jump into the already hot and ready-to-go stream of water. Aiming a jet down at my leg, I can feel my leg release tension as I scrub some of the pain-relief shampoo into the area. 

Time flies as I finish my scrubbing and then my drying before I finally find myself brushing out in front of the mirror. I look down at the bottle of fur gloss on the shelf, and a thought comes to mind.

*She’s all fancy this paw. Don’t want to look too drab next to her in front of everyone. Although, I will be just sitting in the office until it’s time to go home… Eh, whatever, I’ll look nice for her.*

Taking the extra time to make myself look nice, I even contemplate redoing my braids but stop short as I realize that I’ve somehow burned enough time and that the car will be arriving soon. I exit the bathroom and see Tiltva waiting for me in the hallway. She takes a rather *predatory* look over me as I flick an ear to the front door and start to put my new mobility boots on. The normal one slides on so easily, but the mechanical-assist boot is just a bit harder to slip on. The faux-skin boots look so similar to the ones used at the dance hall, but the ease of walking is priceless.

Tiltva steps past me and opens the door just as the car is descending on the street just behind Mom and Dad’s front gate. I actually jog behind Tiltva as she opens the door to see… no one?

The normally occupied car is empty as I follow Tiltva inside and sit down beside her on the large wool seats. As the car begins to rise and speed off towards work, I feel a force on my leg and look to see Tiltva hauling my foot towards her lap.

“Tiltva, what are you doing?”

She freezes in place as her ears and snout flush bright orange, but she continues rotating me to face her, and then she removes my mobility boot as she uses her claws and paws to massage and work the forever-sore tissue in my leg.

“I-it’s just another leg massage. Relax for a bit; you just seem a bit tense this paw.”

“No, ***you*** seem a bit tense. Is everything alright, Tiltva?”

She again freezes as her blue eyes look up and waver for a moment before blinking and going back to massaging my leg.

“Everything is fine. D-Don’t worry.”

*Ah, she’s just really nervous about her upcoming first performance. Brahk, if not for that, then I’d like to finally confess, but I don’t want to get in her head and mess up her moment…*

“If you say so. Thank you, Tiltva.”

“Y-you’re welcome.”

\------

The car comes to a stop just beyond the Oakley household as Tiltva nearly throws open the door and steps out onto the pavement. I do my best to hurry up and follow her as my reequipped boot thunks rhythmically along. I somehow manage to catch up with her as we are already at the door, and she gives a quick knock before unlocking the door and stepping in.

Immediately I can taste a fresh pot of coffee and a similar but subtly different bitterness in the air. We close the door behind us and round the corner to see Ray and Thyla sitting at the table, both waiting on their pads. Just as soon as they spot us, they put away the electronics and give happy smiles in greeting.

“Good mornin;, you two. Both of you are lookin’ very fine today!”

“Why, thank you, Ray! What do you have for first meal this paw?”

“Oh, I think you’ll like this one. Thyla has already said they’re pretty good, but I made a tray of homemade granola bars with a chocolate coatin’. Pretty much oats, grains, nuts, and some chocolate. Goes great all day, but it’s nice and soft right now for breakfast. Oh, and I melted some chocolate sauce for Thyla.”

Thyla’s tail wags underneath her short blue dress as she takes the small bowl full of thick, shiny brown liquid and pushes it towards Tiltva and me, sitting down on the opposite side of the table.

“Here, Tiltva, you try some! It makes them even tastier! Oh, Halin, you can have some too, I guess.”

I break a bar off the sheet of wax paper on the tray and give it a quick dip into the chocolate sauce. I let the excess drizzle off before bringing it in for a bite. Although there is already some of the chocolate on these bars, the liquid version has so much more warmth. The sweet bitterness is soon complemented by a crunch of nuts and a slight hint of salt. Comfortable with my reaction, Tiltva grabs a bite of her own and seems similar in opinion.

“Mmmhm, Ray, these are really good. Good job!”

“Thank you two, of course; help yourselves to some coffee. I have the insulated pot right there with a fresh batch. Though, it’s a lil hot at the moment.”

Hearing his offer but ignoring his warning, I quickly pour myself a cup of the wonderful beverage and slightly burn my tongue on the first sip. The rest of first meal goes on just the same as it usually does, though I thoroughly enjoy as Thyla gets a bit too into the chocolate sauce, and by the end of the meal, her white and red fur snout is a shade of dark brown.

“Now, just look at what you’ve done to yourself, girly! Y-you gotta leave for school in, like, five minutes. Agh, okay, come over here and let’s wash you off.”

As Ray drags the not-at-all-remorseful and giggling Thyla over to the sink, Tiltva pushes back from her chair and seems to march away to the other side of the house.

“Tiltva? Where are you going? I thought your practice was in the dance hall this paw.”

“It is; I’m just getting my dress.”

*Oh, that’s right. New… nice dress…*

“Okay, uhm, see you in a bit!”

Just as Tiltva is out of eyesight, I see Ray nearly chasing the shrieking and laughing Thyla around as she tries to put on her backpack and dart out the door with her snout and whiskers dripping with water.

“N-now you get out there, and don’t you dare use my car seats to dry your face! Use your backpack or something, I don’t care, but not my seats! Hey! Wait!”

He manages at the last second to halt the darting Thyla to a stop at the door and then pulls her in close.

“Love you, have a good day at school.”

“Love you too, Dad.”

With that, Thyla is out the door, and Ray gently closes it and leans against it with tired eyes.

*They’re just so sweet, I honestly don’t know if there’s a safer pup on Skalga.*

“Chocolate, I swear it, Halin; it makes Farsul nearly go feral with energy, and I’m not willin’ to say no since she loves it so much. Anyway, I see Tiltva is dressin’ up, so I’ll ask, don’t you also have an outfit to wear around today?”

“Oh brahk, you’re right! Let me go change!”

I jump out of my chair, and my boots thunk as I make my way back to the recording studio. In a mini-whirlwind of red and glitter, I briefly pass by Tiltva as she makes her exit. She gives me a light tap on the snout with her tail as she heads back to the kitchen, and I resign myself to not following behind.

I walk inside to the wonderfully weird space and head right over to the storage closet. Among stacks of chairs and instruments, hanging on a rack with all the others’ performance outfits, is my specially ordered ‘flannel’ shirt. I take the garment off the hanger and unbutton the topmost two buttons to slip it over my head and snout. With it on, I grab my white cowboy hat and slip out and back towards the kitchen to hear and then see Tiltva and Ray cleaning up the leftovers and dishes from breakfast.

Even just the short walk down the hall already has my arms feeling hot. As I stand at the edge of the dining room, I remember the sleeve-rolling method Ray taught me, and I quickly start on shortening one sleeve to let a bit more air flow on my arms. As I get the first one done, I look up to see Tiltva wide-eyed, staring at me, stopped in the middle of the room with a few dirty cups in her paws. As I tilt my ears down, her entire head flushes a bright orange, and she scampers off to the kitchen with a bleat.

*What? Why was she staring at me like that? Is it this shirt? But then why did she bloom?*

Just as I finish up the other sleeve, Ray and Tiltva seem to finally be done with cleanup, and they come out of the kitchen. Ray takes one long look at me and then over to Tiltva before deeply nodding his head.

“I just gotta say, you two look real nice in western wear. I’m biased, of course, but I’d guess that other alien folks are gonna be rather jealous when they get eyes on you two fitted out.”

Even as Ray compliments my outfit, I can feel myself blooming, but not to his compliment. As Ray talks, I can’t take my eyes away from Tiltva as she shuffles back and forth on her paws, causing her dress to shimmer and sway around her. 

*The white boots, the red dress, the white hat… How lucky am I to be able to just have a glimpse of the most beautiful girl on Skalga…*

“-and I think that should cover everythin’ that needs to get done today. Well, before lunch, that is, if we can, I’d like to have a light afternoon. Got that, you two?”

I forcefully peel my gaze from Tiltva as I flick my ears in approval at Ray. All that despite not knowing a single word or task he asked of me.

“Yeah, sure, Ray. Umm, what was that about second meal?”

Strangely, Tiltva answers for him.

“Oh, Ray just said to work hard this first claw; then after second meal it’ll be easier on us. Ah, uhm, speaking of second meal, do you want to join me in the dance hall to eat lunch?”

“Oh, yeah, we can. But why not the restaurant?”

“I, uh, dunno, just thought it’d be a nice change in scenery. That’s all…”

Ray strokes his chin and suddenly gasps just a bit.

“Oh, but remember, the employee doors are under maintenance today, so you two will have to use the front doors only.”

Tiltva’s tail thrashes in agreement as Ray reminds us of the door maintenance.

“Yep! And Halin, don’t worry about grabbing food; I’ll grab it for us. Just come straight to the dance hall for lunch, but give me a bit of a warning that you are so we can wrap up practice.”

*What is going on here? Are they teasing me because I didn’t help with cleanup? Or is it something else?*

“Okay… you two are being kind of strange. Is it my outfit?”

“No buddy, it looks awesome, it really does. Now let’s get to work. Tiltva, get some warmups in, and I’ll join you in a couple hours.”

Tiltva takes no time to shuffle her boots across the room and out the door as Ray gives a half wave to her goodbye, and I follow behind him as we head up to the office to work our respective jobs. I let my work pad load all my programs as I take a moment to check any sleep claw emails that might’ve come through on this work account.

*Restaurant order confirmation…*

*Payroll reminders…*

*Rental boot repairs…*

*Multi-million credit tourism grant…*

*Parking lot repair-*

He said that he agrees this will help bring in money to the city and lake district, but we do have to allow other performers to use the stage on occasion.”

“Oh shit! That’s awesome news! Congrats Halin!”

“‘Congrats Halin’? But Ray, this is your project and business.”

“Sure, but you’re the one who wrote the proposal and did the initial meetin’ with the Magistar! This credit goes to you!”

“Yeah… I mean, I’m sure Begelen helped us out a lot, though.”

A twinge of fear runs through my heart as Ray’s eyes narrow at the mention of the Chief Exterminator.

*Uh oh, that’s most definitely not a happy human stare…*

“Halin, how much did Begelen help out here?”

“I, uhh, don’t know actually. I was just saying that she probably helped out. I-is that a bad thing? I thought you liked Begelen?”

Ray relaxes in his chair as he nods back.

“Oh, I love Aunt Beg. It’s just… sometimes I worry about causin’ her too much trouble or her overextendin’ herself to help us. I know she does some… let’s just say, ‘less than legal’ things to keep this place runnin’ nearly exactly how I want it to. I don’t want her to lose her job or public image because of us.”

Keeping Ray’s words in mind, it dawns on me just how bad it would be for all of us if Begelen lost her job or power. Inspectors and officials would swarm here and ruin everything Ray has had going. 

*Sure, Ray would still have his other two jobs, but I and many others would be out of a job.*

We work for a while longer, and I feel myself desiring another cup of coffee when Ray gets a loud ping on his pad. I turn an eye and ear his way as I watch his expression over the contents of the message. He smiles before shifting to a frown.

“Anything important, Ray?”

“Yes, but no. One of the meat vats is throwin’ a fit, so I’ll go see what I can do then make my rounds of the property.”

*Meat vats! I haven’t gotten to walk back there in a while. I’d like to feel the hot spring water again.*

“Oh! Do you need any help?”

“Help? Ah, nah, it’ll be fine. You keep gettin’ us money, and I’ll try to hold this place a bit together. Catch up after lunch, yeah? Oh! Don’t forget your lunch with Tiltva!”

“Sounds good…”

*Lunch with Tiltva? Yeah, I know he knows that I love Tiltva but even then he’s being a bit pushy. Oh whatever, second meal is in a quarter claw; I should just be glad to share it with her.*

I click on and off a few more tourism grant applications, and I nearly jump out of my wool as I see the clock has somehow already made it to second meal. I save my work and slowly prepare myself to stand up and get going. My mobility boot thunks along the wooden floors as I go down the hall, down the stairs, and out the door to the property. I crunch along the gravel path to the dance hall, and just as I am about to open the back door, I remember to use the front entrance.

Going around the front to the customer side, I find the large sliding barn doors are shut, and I curiously hear no noise of any sort from within. I slide open one door to see the entire dance hall as I’ve never seen it before. All the skylights are closed, and the only light comes from the open door behind me. I cautiously slide it closed and hobble forward with a bit of anxiety in my chest at the dark and empty building, which seems more cavernous by the moment. I make it onto the dance floor itself and work up the courage to bleat into the darkness.

“Tiltva?”

Just then, the sound of the band starts to play from the stage, but I can still see no one there. I halt in place and listen; the whole band must be hiding from me as some sort of prank.

*Is this what Tiltva and Ray wanted to do? Trick me into watching a practice? I already watch their practices when I can; it's not exactly a big request.*

Suddenly, a single skylight opens its shutters, and on the stage of the dance hall, I see a red gem shining in the void. A beauty I am lucky enough to see every paw stands alone in the beam of golden light. Her white hat casts a small shadow over her head but not enough to blot out the blue diamonds that are her eyes. In her paw she is shakily gripping a microphone, [but with a change in the song, I see her take a deep breath and](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1oum1l6/the_nature_of_music_side_a_track_6_and_if_not/)\-

My breath seems to take up my entire chest, but I takes all of my effort to even start to relieve the pressure.

*Just like we practiced, he’s there, but he’s not. Enough to not stall. That doesn’t even make sense? Eh whatever. Okay, here I go.*

“Halin, I don’t know how to say it, but I think I can sing it.”

>*""You leaned close to ask me*

>*If my drink had gone too warm*

>*But I was too far gone already*

>*In the quiet of your warmth*

>*And just answered you instead*

>*If someone else sees the clues I missed*

>*then I'll still thank the stars*

>*For every time we kissed*

*-*

>*In my head, at least...*

>*'Cause none of 'em were real""*

With the first chorus done, I find myself pacing the stage, and as I move out of the first skylight, a second one opens to follow me. Despite wanting to make it easier on Yvette controlling the lights, I just can’t stop from prancing around the stage.

>*""I tried to write it down once*

>*But the pen got stuck mid-line*

>*For the ""almosts"" of my list*

>*for what I thought was my chance*

*-*

>*And if not...*

>*I'll move on and heal""*

Coming up on the final moments of the song, I look out and once again stare down Halin in his outfit that has been burning me up all paw. The lights finally come on, revealing the whole band is here in support, and even Ray is playing supporting guitar. Halin now stands on the lighted dance floor as we bring the song to a close.

>*""If not now, I'll learn my lesson*

>*If not us, I'll take the fall*

>*But loving you in silence*

>*was better than not at all!*

*-*

>*If not now, I'll stop my waiting*

>*I'll fold away these daydreams*

>*like lyrics never seen*

*-*

>*And if not...*

>*I'll move on...*

>*But stars know how I'll feel""*

With the final note hanging in the air, we receive as big of an ovation as one man can produce coming from the brightest void in my life out there alone on the dance floor. I take a small moment to catch my breath before sitting my microphone back on the stand and leaping off the stage to run up to him. He lets out a bleat of surprise as I nearly tackle him in a hug. He hugs back even stronger.

“Halin, d-do you understand now?”

“Y-you…”

*Come on, come on, here it goes! Exactly as planned!*

“Yes!?”

“You’re really good at singing.”

*AHHHH!*

“No!”

“Ah, uh, you’re really pretty in your outfit?”

*I’m gonna kill him and then myself! Right here, right now!*

I find my tail using a mind of its own as it goes up and wraps around Halin’s neck as his eyes go wide.

“NO! I mean, thank you, but brahk Halin, I-I ***love*** you! That’s what I wrote that song and just sang about! I was all for ***you…*** I-if you don’t feel the same way, that’s fine. I-I just needed to finally say it, but I couldn’t, so I sang it…”

His ears flatten on the brim of his hat as he tilts his head at me in confusion as if I had just said the stupidest thing he’s ever heard. My face flushes orange in embarrassment as the stupid brahking plan had failed just like I thought it would. I’m about to run away to hide when a loud thump scares me still. I see Ray up on the stage with the microphone in his hands, and with a wave, [the band starts up again.](https://youtu.be/0Nu7rl0sOfw)

Once the shock of the band just going right into another song wears off, I resume my rapid exit of shame but am stopped by a firm paw grip around my wrist. I try to pull away through forming tears, but instead I am turned around and hugged again. To my surprise, the hug slightly loosens, but the hugger begins to pull me side to side, around and around.

*Dancing, dancing, you idiot. He’s dancing with you.*

>*""I don't believe in superstars*

>*Organic food and foreign cars*

>*I don't believe the price of gold*

>*The certainty of growing old*

>*That right is right and left is wrong*

>*That north and south can't get along*

>*That east is east and west is west*

>*And being first is always best*

*-*

>*But I believe in love*

>*I believe in babies*

>*I believe in mom and dad*

>*And I believe in you""*

I play along, and even though we both keep quite literally stepping on each other's paws, we make it work to keep time with the song in a slow dance that seems just as natural as the sun hanging in the sky.

>*""Well I don't believe that heaven waits*

>*For only those who congregate*

>*I like to think of God as love*

>*He's down below, he's up above*

>*He's watchin' people, everywhere*

>*Sometimes I wonder who I am*

*-*

>*But I believe in love*

>*I believe in music*

>*I believe in magic*

>*And I believe in you""*

Ray and the band morph into something beyond a background. The world swirls,, and I feel whole and warm and loved. At last…

>*""I know with all my certainty*

>*What's going on with you and me*

>*Is a good thing*

As the song comes to a slow end, Halin stops and pulls his head down into my shoulder. I feel just the smallest tear roll off his eye and into my neck.

“Tiltva, I love you more than I can really handle. Like really, I’m trying to think of words, but you and now Ray are doing a lot better at that. Is it okay if I just hug you really hard and have this dance count instead?”

*It worked, it really worked…*

This time, ***I*** lose my ability to speak, and I resolve to just give a big lick to the side of his snout as an answer. He quickly pulls his head up and gives me a lick. As I’m prepping to do it back again, I hear laughs and whistles coming from the stage, and a familiar voice booms into the microphone.

“Hey, get a room, you two!”

Laughs erupt even harder from our human coworkers, and Halin and I bury our faces into each other’s shoulders to hide. Ray quiets the band down and as he speaks up, I can see him wiping tears from his eyes.

“Ok, ok, that’s enough laughin’, but seeing as that went so well, how about you two take the rest of the day off and head back into town? To do what? I don’t care; just keep my car clean!”

""Ray, are you crying?""

""Ah, just a bit. *I Believe in You* was Mrs. Oakley's and my wedding first dance song.""

*Wedding?! That’s it. I’m going to combust right here and now. At least I got to confess first before dying of embarrassment and excitement.* 

“Thank you, Ray! I, uh, guess we’ll be leaving now! I was promised lunch with Tiltva and there are plenty of places downtown!”

Before he can make a move, I grip his wrist, wrap his tail in mine, and drag us off the dance floor and out the back door towards the garage. I practically throw open the door and fling myself inside and bury my snout in my paws. The door closes, and a warm mass scoots up very close beside me and wraps me in a hug with another big lick on my partially covered snout. I hear a destination being entered in, and I glance up to see an extremely nice restaurant downtown targeted and the hovercar leaving and going on its way.

“Halin, that’s a very, ***very*** expensive restaurant. I mean, I won’t complain, but-”

“The restaurant isn’t the destination. We’re going to the building across the street.”

I look at the map and see…

“A hotel?”

The words barely leave my tongue before both of our faces turn as orange as the sun.

*Bold,* ***MY*** *bold void.*

“Y-yeah, u-unless-”

“NO! I mean, ***yes***, let’s go.”

“Good, good, I just… Okay, there’s no good way of saying this without being awkward and I don’t expect ***‘it,’*** but I got the gene reversal not too long ago and it does worry me a bit if you don’t-”

*Aw, how thoughtful and practical.*

“Oh, Halin, I’ve had the reversal since it was released.”

“You did? Why? Was there someone…”

“No, don’t you ***dare*** go there. Trust me, I’ve loved you since my mom died, but if you really want to know why I already got the treatment…” He quickly flicks his ears at me over and over again in cute excitement. “Remember the first time I was living with you and your parents after my dad died, and that one time you came into my room and sat with me and talked with me on my bed all through the entire sleep claw and I had to go to work super tired?”

“Yeah?”

“Well, the reason I was late for third meal that paw, was I went to a gene reversal clinic right after work in the hopes that you’d come back into my room and then we could…”

I watch and giggle as his face falls in horror and realization.

“Ah, brahk me…”

“Oh trust me Halin, we’re getting to that part.”

I get oh so closer and grab both of his wrists in my paws.

“No, no! Tiltva wait! Ray asked us to-”

I’ve been hosting travellers in Goa for over 10 years, and The Lazy Leaf is my newest place — definitely not my first BnB, but one I’m really excited about.

It’s a calm, leafy property in Anjuna with two private 2BHK villas that share a common garden. The idea was simple: a place that feels relaxed, uncluttered, and genuinely comfortable — somewhere you can slow down after the beach, work remotely, or just do nothing at all.

Each villa is fully self-contained, the garden is shared (great for morning coffee or evening chats), and the vibe is peaceful rather than party-heavy. Quiet hours are respected.

If you’re looking for:

A clean, well-managed stay

A host who actually cares (and doesn’t disappear after check-in)

A spot that feels more like a home than a hotel


…this might be your thing 🙂

Happy to answer questions, share links, or just chat about Goa hosting in general.

• Walk around Sankey Tank
• Post-walk coffee nearby

👉 Bring a light jacket, evenings have been surprisingly chilly this year.

1pnzytw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pnzytw/aio_found_messages_on_partners_phone/,AIO? Found messages on partners phone,"I’m unsure where to begin. I’m 30(f), my partner is 38(m). We have been together for a year, and I can only define this time as a pure, supportive partnership where we have supported each other through hardship but connected and enjoyed life together.  We were starting to talk about coming together more formally and plans for the future. We both knew we wanted children before we started dating - I made that very clear as I have had relationships in the past where that choice has destroyed them.

Our relationship is incredible. We match on an intimacy level, we communicate well and have intellectual conversation, we laugh, we have fun, we enjoy the same things but also are both diverse in our interests.

 A few weeks ago he left his laptop open, and I saw his WhatsApp messages to a girl I had raised problems with before - notably the nature of their relationship. There is a power dynamic that cannot be ignored and I told him he was playing with fire by continuing to nurture this, particularly because this woman seems really mentally unwell and he would continuously (only in the early days) mention how she would send him a barrage of abuse and tell him how awful he was and then backtrack and he would be the best person in the world. He mentioned her a few times when we were in the early stages of dating, and I made it clear that I thought this was an unhealthy dynamic and he had to reassess his position in this and stop feeding this behaviour due to the ethics of it. I had no idea they were in contact to the degree that they are. I should also mention that he has multiple female friends, and I have no qualms about this. They are supportive friendships, and I am not jealous. I have given him so much of myself, but mostly I have trusted that there is nothing to worry about.

I skimmed the messages. But I saw a lot in there - notably one night late he told her he was horny. And questioning her during a conversation about whether she was thinking about a literary trope in a sexual way. Turns out they’ve been sharing “coffee”, too, via video chat. He’s made a few mentions about me, and my living situation. He also mentioned about his intention to move abroad, due to applying for work elsewhere, and she asked him what would happen to me. He responded with “she may come too” or something along those lines. When in actuality, he has asked me to come with him and told me he will financially provide for me.

I feel at a loss. I love this person and our relationship to date - though we have had our own little fragments, as most do, but I have to stress that they have been futile - has been overall overwhelmingly pure and positive and full of love and care. I feel so blindsided.

I confronted him, of course, and he’s mortified. But he doesn’t recognise the level of disrespect. He has broken something within us.

This weekend I was helping him in his home, and he popped out. He hastily rushed back to “check on something” but in reality he grabbed his laptop, presumably because he doesn’t want me looking. I should say, I wouldn’t intentionally look, even if I felt I had to, because I don’t believe in snooping on the autonomy of a partner. ",2,1765885690.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False

I’d love to meet an intellectually curious woman (21+) who believes in communication, commitment, and small acts of consistency. Someone who doesn’t rush depth but values it when it arrives.

1pnzq8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pnzq8g/tldr_i_need_some_advice_from_the_community_im_a/,TL;DR: I need some advice from the community .. I’m a 32(M) and my partner is 28(F),"TL;DR: Just to be clear, I want don’t want this post to bias nor am I be one sided. I need some genuine advice or opinion about Me 32(M) in this scenario.

I’ve been together with my girlfriend/partner 28(F) for over a year now but within a year, we have lived together, explored Europe together spontaneously multiple times, fallen deeply in love with each other, had been to wedding venues, Halloween events, all types of couple stuff together. I revealed to her every woman that I’ve ever had a relationship with in my past and I’ve also told her about some of my current female friends which I chose not to see in person because I realised that she may potentially not feel okay about this - even though I’ve been invited by female friends to coffee outside, house warming meets etc.

Now I trust my girlfriend as I know her and she has a good heart, she tells me the same that she trusts me and she knows my deep nature. We never really intrude in our personal space in terms of “who’s that calling” or “why is this person messaging you” etc, because we both live together and share everything together. I would believe we are completely and openly honest with each other about everything.

During the start of her first full time retail job in my area that I’ve grown up in, she was adjusting to everyone and the job role itself. She had multiple Men in their mid-40s and 50s get way too close to her just because she has smiley and friendly nature, she was being polite and serving customers with the idea of meet and greet. Particularly, she was harassed by one guy in his 50s who was coming to the shop almost daily regardless of her telling him that she lives with her boyfriend and has named me. This guy did not see that as a problem and offered to help her relocate and attempted to bring her a bag of vapes during her night shift one evening. She told me all of this herself as I am oblivious to what happens in the retail store. I agreed to intervene (as would a serious partner do) and this was making her extremely unhappy and uncomfortable. 

So, while this is happening we come across the origins of problem number 2, she has a store manager, who at first was really respectful to me when he had met me the one time, but at the same time asked my girlfriend to not get me involved or tell me anything that happens with her in the store. He found out about the harassment and intervened as he knew the customer formally as they were mutual friends. After the manager intervened and told my girlfriend to not get me involved. He spoke to the person harassing her and he never interacted with my girlfriend again, but he would pop in once in a month without speaking or interacting with my girlfriend. Now the store manager has become a problem, ever since this ordeal, he began getting close to my girlfriend as they work together. My girlfriend, again, claims she was being friendly with everyone in the store including him. So he began to cook for her, makes jokes with her, tell my girlfriend about problems with his marriage and how he doesn’t chase after his wife after arguments. He starts to show off to my girlfriend by showing her pictures of a beach he frequently goes to, he starts saying inappropriate comments such as “I will eat poison if it is served by your hand”, “my favourite eye colour is green” (my partners eyes are the colour green - yes I am lucky 😅) and there has been an incident where the manager has used a hand towel to wipe off a smudge/dirt patch on my girlfriend’s face when she was walking by him in the back of the store. Now all of this is happening and she came to me and told me as I’m oblivious to what happens in the store as she realised this isn’t right. My girlfriend was crying at home and explaining everything that’s happened and that was happening while they were bonding as colleagues. The store manager is in his early 50s and always tries to show himself off as if he’s young to my girlfriend, I often feel like he is competing with me. I realised the point that the store manager has feelings for my girlfriend was when he started lying to her that he lives on the nice part of town and that his Porsche is bought outright when my girlfriend didn’t even ask nor care about these topics he brought up. I also realise he has feelings when there was this one time, myself and her had an argument related to something else, she was crying in the store and because he is always watching her, he randomly came out of the back of the store to attempt to comfort her. She ignored him and without him knowing the cause of her sad feelings he assumed and said “you should leave your boyfriend, do you think he’s out there crying over you right now”, “it’s not worth it over a guy” etc. I also realised that he has feelings for my girlfriend when they finally had a massive argument 2 months ago and my girlfriend told me she stormed out of the store and the store manager (who claims he never chases after his wife during an argument) chased after my girlfriend up until the front of the store and then he headed back in as my girlfriend had left the area for an hour during the fight. Now all of this is happening and makes my girlfriend extremely uncomfortable at work but she also relies on this job before she could start her career which is happening soon, I told her numerous times that I could intervene or we can try find you a new job elsewhere (Now \*my way\* of interviening will definitely get her fired 😂). As she knows it’ll be a struggle to jump ship when she is close to starting a full time entry level career, she agreed to handle it and keep her distance and realise her mistake in bonding with this specific age group in my area (40-50s males). She still works at the store but with less interactions with the store manager even though he attempts daily to restore the bond they had before the fight. The store manager claims to be in a loveless marriage with two young children and used to talk about his mirage problems with my girlfriend and numerously said to my girlfriend “I can never have conversations with my wife like I have with you”.

Fast forward to 2 days ago, my girlfriend decided to head over to a coffee shop near her house but called me and asked me to join her. She got there 30 minutes before I did and told me she is sat outside waiting. During the time of me making my way to her, the store owner of this local coffee shop (male potentially late 40s) has a very busy store but keeps coming out of the store to make conversation with my girlfriend who is the only customer seated outside. So as I traverse to her, he makes several attempts to speak to her by going inside the store and back out, my girlfriend told him that she is waiting for me (her boyfriend) to arrive as I’ll have coffee with her, he tells her that he is cold standing outside talking to her and that she should come inside and wait for me indoors. She accepts the invitation on the basis that this is a polite interaction. He makes her a coffee on the house, but, he decides to make himself a coffee and seat her on a private table and he decides to sit right across her and make conversation. This is fine, however, when I arrive I’m oblivious that they are seated so I approach and I am instantly greeted by the store owner and he names me by name and shakes my hand. I had no feelings and no jealousy or worry as I’ve met this store owner before a few times during the year (not my first time going), he claims to not remember me but then when I sat down, my girlfriend and the store owner became extremely awkward when I sat down as they were having a good conversation with laughter and smiles (still fine in my book). But then there was this silence and the store owner without finishing his coffee decided to leave the table in an awkward fashion and asked me to sit where he was sitting as “that’s what two couples in a relationship” should do. Before he left he asked me what would I like to drink and I said “I’ll have the same as you a flat white”. He never came back and sent a barista to bring over the coffee instead. He never came back to the table during the time I was seated next to my girlfriend. I never made this an issue, yes it was awkward but I never even saw this guy as a threat or a problem in the slightest. After me and my girlfriend leave the store, I realise she is extremely quiet and became frustrated while we decide to have lunch. I noticed a mood change, she then decides to get upset and disappointed with me about another random topic that was discussed a solid hour after this coffee shop scenario. But after an argument later on that day, she then admitted she was slightly moody that I would misunderstand the coffee shop situation. I feel like she may have realised, she has put herself in the same situation again by accepting invitations or initiating friendships from the get go with males in my area in their 40s and 50s. This still doesn’t bother me as she claims that this was always her lesson to learn not to interact with this specific male age group.

I do admit I overreacted by telling her “why is she always putting herself and us into situations which would make her uncomfortable when males in their 40s-50s get closer and closer to a point where they are extremely interested whether me being in the picture or not” as we have seen this twice before even though I told her these things happen because she feels the need to become friendly back to middle aged men when they show some type of hospitality. Am I in the wrong to think like this?, that she shouldn’t give anyone a chance and not to look at the worst in people of this age group that approach my girlfriend when she is minding her business or at work?

The real issue is, I’ve constantly avoided the friends I have stated at the start of this post that are females and have numerously invited me out for coffee catch up. I haven’t met with any of these female friends since start of my relationship with my girlfriend just because I don’t want her to have her feelings hurt or affected in case she feels that I bond with friends that are girls. At the same time, my childhood friend reconnected with me in June 2025 and she is married and constantly invites me to have coffee with her as I’ve not seen her in 8 years. I told my girlfriend about my childhood friend and how she reconnected with me, I showed her all the text messages with her as I found my girlfriend constantly crying in the car while I dropped her to work. She even said “I should run away with her” and that I “broke her heart” because of a friendly interaction with a friend that has reconciled with me, I’ve never met her for coffee once nor did I speak to her on the phone for the last 7 months when we had first reconciled as friends. (My girlfriend has a right to be upset and feel threatened by my childhood friend because my friend used to fancy me when we were younger, again, it’s not ever in my agenda to become a cheater or be labeled as one as my life experiences has taught me to never stoop this low to ever become one).

Now the question and help I need from the community, this is my first ever post on Reddit, I hope I’ve stuck to all guidelines which I’m aware that I have, my girlfriend always labels her situations with other people who have become a problem as “polite interactions” and that I misunderstand, fine, I may have overreacted given then fact that my girlfriend has been harassed by the results of “polite interactions”, but would it be a problem if I have coffee with friends that are women in their 30s as this is also considered a “polite interaction” with friends I actually know?

I can see my girlfriend’s behaviour is explosive and she acts like she doesn’t care and I can “do whatever I want”.

The ultimate question is it fair for me to have coffee with friends that are females?

I am not sure what to do moving forward, the owner said I'd get ""barista certified"" before they close down which I can carry to any jobs in the future, and I also can use them as a reference and have them put a good word in for me.

1pnzpdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pnzpdg/my_friends_had_a_biological_dog/,My Friends Had a Biological Dog,"We all have those friends who are a bit weird, but who you’re still friends with. For me, Monica and Rand were those friends.

I’d initially met the couple through my ex-girlfriend Kyla, who’d introduced me to them at a party. They all went way back and we used to hang out a lot together as a group. When Kyla and I broke up and she moved away, I just kept socialising with them. They were fun people and always had a way of keeping things light that I enjoyed—even with their quirks.

They were the kind of couple who treated their pets—of which they had several—like children. I loved animals myself, so this wouldn’t have been an issue for me. But they were on another level. They owned a deluxe stroller for walking their rabbit, dressed up their cat in expensive outfits and cooked gourmet meals for their tortoise. But it never seemed enough for them. 

When people asked if they planned on having kids, they’d always winkingly reply that they were trying to conceive—a puppy.

As someone else who didn’t want children, I’d always laugh along with them and their silly, tension-diffusing joke. Still, in spite of the ridiculousness of it, it slightly unnerved me. Knowing those two, part of me believed they really would give birth to a dog if nature worked that way.

The day eventually came when Monica and Rand finally announced that they’d welcomed a new furbaby into their family. They called me up eagerly to invite me over and meet him, and I happily accepted. They did have an eye for getting cute pets.

Arriving at their place with a chew toy gift, I was surprised at how tight-lipped the couple were about their new dog. Typically after acquiring a new pet, they would gush endlessly about the story of why they chose them, what breed they were and so on. But this time, they just beamed and led me upstairs to one of their guest bedrooms. 

To my confusion, I saw that the normally empty room had been converted into what looked like a nursery. There were dog-themed toys and decorations set up around the room, but it looked more like something for a dog-loving infant than a dog.

Monica warmly gestured to the side of the room and I saw something I had expected to see even less: a crib.

“Meet our *biological* dog, Pete”.

I resisted the urge to cringe at my friends’ usual joke. Peering over the rails of the crib, I saw napping on the plush linen was…a puppy. A dog, just like they said it had been.

And at the same time, it was nothing like any dog I’d ever seen before.

The beagle pup had short fur, four paws, a tail—all the things a dog would have. But there was just something so…off about it. Its face looked uncannily like that of a human. Its arms and legs curled up the way a baby would. Its brown and black-toned fur felt familiar in a human way.

And as it stirred, blinking up at me tiredly, I saw its eyes. Bright blue eyes.

“Well, isn’t he precious?” asked Rand excitedly.

I shook myself out of my unease and remembered why they’d invited me here.

“Uh, oh yeah, he’s the cutest thing, haha” I said in the most adoring voice I could muster. “Where, uh, did you get this little guy anyway?”

Monica glanced over at Rand, held her hand up to her mouth and whispered. 

“Okay, don’t tell anybody this but…”

My eyes widened, half-expecting some twisted birthing story.

“...we got him from a *breeder*”. 

They both laughed, before quieting themselves for their sleeping puppy.

“Guilty as charged, I know,” said Rand. “We normally adopt rescues with our pets, but we just *had* to have this fellow. As I’m sure you can see, he’s the *perfect* dog for both of us.”

I awkwardly agreed, left the chew toy with them and departed. Monica and Rand had always been eccentric and over-the-top with their pets, I’d known that. But building an entire nursery for a puppy? They were the type to consider their pets their children, sure, but this was a bit much, even for them.

And then there was the appearance of Pete the puppy. Maybe it was the human name, or the crib bed, or the “biological dog” joke influencing my perception. But something about the way it looked did not feel right to me. Was this breeder story real, or had they gone out of their way to pick the freakiest looking dog from the pound to go along with their “biological dog” schtick? Those weirdos would.

Then again, I reasoned, Monica and Rand had been good friends to me over the years. When Kyla and I split, those two were the biggest cheerleaders of us getting back together. They played matchmaker for a while, trying to spark a common thread between the two of us that would unite us as a couple again, despite our differences. Maybe they just wanted to double date again. But I appreciated the effort.

A puppy that hadn’t grown into its look yet and a dog nursery was no reason to abandon a years-long friendship.

So, over the next few months, I saw more and more of strange Pete.

At parties and gatherings at Monica and Rand’s house, other friends of the pair expressed similar sentiments to me. I was apparently not the only one to notice the uncanny features of their newest pet. And, as they always did, Monica and Rand would just laugh and continue the joke.

“Little Pete has both our eyes!”

“He gets his nose from his dad and lips from his mom!” 

“Our hair colour genes are so strong, he got both!”

These little comments from the pair could have been funny if they weren’t so eerily true. Pete’s eyes really did look like a combination of the blue eyes Monica and Rand had—blue eyes were considerably rare for beagles. Pete’s crooked nose and thin lips really did resemble his respective parents’. And Pete’s light brown and black fur really was a one-to-one match for brunette Monica’s and raven-haired Rand’s.

Most people brushed off the strange coincidences of these features, thinking it a funny novelty. But, as the puppy grew into a dog, it became more and more apparent that these oddities didn’t end with the dog’s appearance. 

I would catch sight of these occurrences more and more. Pete ambling around the way a toddler would, leaning back as if to try walking on two legs. Or him mouthing words whenever people spoke around him, like a child trying to learn to talk. But worst of all was the way he would stare at you. A stare not of happy canine curiosity, but of sad human pleading. That, and his barks that sounded like screams.

Being around the pair and their surreal pet became harder and harder for me. They indulged openly in the gag that he was their child, chuckling about what school he was going to go to or what sports he should compete in. It was sickening. Meanwhile, Pete did not get along well with any of the other animals in their household. I couldn’t stand to be around him, yet, he would always seek me out.

The last straw came the day when human-looking Pete shuffled over with his human gait, fixed me with his human stare, and dropped a scrap of paper in my lap.

“Oh, that’s so adorable, it seems that George is Pete’s favourite uncle” laughed Monica, sipping her wine.

“You know, George, maybe this is a sign that you should have one of your own” guffawed Rand, swigging his own glass.

I fake laughed as always and quickly hid the scrap of paper in my pocket. Fortunately, it didn’t look like anyone had seen me. Whatever this paper was, I instinctively wanted to read it away from the couple’s intervention.

When I finally stepped away from the group, I pulled out the scrap of paper from Pete and saw that it was the crumpled remnant of a business card.

*“The Kin Kennel*

*For the next piece of your animal family, with a piece of you.”*

It was from the breeder that Monica and Rand had used for Pete, I was sure of it. So the story they told me about going to a breeder had been correct after all, it would seem. But why had they been so private about the place? And why had Pete—a literal dog—seemingly wanted me to know about it?

I couldn’t bury my feelings about their pet any longer. I had to investigate it, if not more for my sake, then for that poor dog’s.

That evening, after leaving their house, I made my way to the address on that business card. It was a residential one in a nice suburb, which wasn’t too surprising for an animal breeder. Spying the doorbell, I noted that there were a few ways I could go about entering. However, I decided on the most reckless one. I didn’t want to just be sent away. I wanted answers.

So, instead, I crept around the back, pried open the cellar door with a spade from next to the shed, and descended inside.

When I flicked on the light, I had expected to find myself in a puppy mill of some kind. But what surrounded me instead was a laboratory. Sleek, shiny and sterile, like the inside of a veterinarian’s office, but with more scientific equipment strewn about. Behind me were shelved cabinets with various marked samples in them. I had no idea where to start looking for information. Thankfully, a source came along at that very moment.

“Who the hell are you and what are you doing in here!” shouted a man in a smoking jacket from the top of the stairs.

“I should ask you the same questions!” I retorted, immediately reaching for my phone. Before he could threaten to call the cops, I began snapping pictures left and right.

“Either you start talking about what it is you do to these animals or these go straight to the cops!”. For emphasis, I raised my phone at the bespectacled man. He paused for a moment, considering his options, and then smiled.

“Very well then, intruder” he said, clearing his throat. “My name is Dr Welsh. I was formerly an esteemed human embryologist and ardent animal lover. Then they fired me, so I decided to marry my two passions in life. I take it you’ve seen the results of my work?”

I looked around the room, trying to hold off the horrified comprehension that was dawning.

“My friends…Monica and Rand…their dog…it’s not a normal dog, is it?”

“It’s what the *new* normal for a dog should be,” he boasted. “Those two were great clients. They understood the truth—that animals are the perfect children. I hated helping parents have human children. Children are rude, loud, ungrateful. But I loved helping friends adopt animals. Animals are gentle, soft, loyal.”

Resentment began to invade his voice.

“There was only one problem to fix. Parents of children get to see themselves in their offspring. Parents of pets don’t. It’s an injustice that I now solve. I inject human DNA from both ‘dog parents’ into the embryos of their future pets. Then, when the litter is born, I present them a puppy with a little piece of each of them.”

That left only one grim question for me to ask.

“...where are these litters?”

Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw when Dr Welsh led me outside and opened the shed door. 

At once I understood that Pete, as disturbing as he looked, had been the most presentable spawn of his siblings. A sea of twisted, aberrant faces and bodies of puppies spanned across the dim shed. Creatures halfway between human and dog, with jumbled mashes of features like skin and fur, hands and claws, bottoms and tails. Uttering childlike, animalistic screams, begging confusedly for death. 

I granted it to them.

While Dr Welsh feebly tried to stop me, the aged man was unsuccessful. I set the shed alight with a match that night, ending every one of the demented hybrids’ suffering. Most importantly, however, I left the house laboratory intact—for when the authorities arrived.

Monica and Rand were arrested for their use of the illegal experimental breeder not long after. Good riddance. Mercifully, after being seized by the police, their “biological dog” was euthanized too. Pete’s desperate blue eyes would haunt me no more.

Word spread amongst most of our friends about what had happened. It was all very hush hush though, as people didn’t want to acknowledge turning a blind eye to the clearly humanised dog for so long. 

The best outcome of this furore, however, was Kyla reaching out to me a few weeks later. She had no idea why our friends had been arrested, and it was on me to break the news to her. Over coffee, my old flame and I started reconnecting like no time had passed. When I mentioned Monica and Rand’s name, she chirped up first.

“Apparently, they went to prison, can you believe it?!” she exclaimed. “And to think it happened right after they showed up and dumped this weird puppy on me.” 

My blood ran cold. The teaspoons on the table suddenly reminded me of those I’d used at the couple’s house, covered in my DNA.

I watched, horrified, as Kyla reached into her handbag and pulled out a little cocker spaniel puppy—a gift from our dog-altering, matchmaking friends.

“George, you’re not gonna believe how much this little gal looks like both of us…”

1pnzoju,https://www.reddit.com/r/missouri/comments/1pnzoju/most_people_visiting_kc_pick_their_stay_based_on/,Most people visiting KC pick their stay based on convenience - and that’s the wrong move,"I’ve noticed a pattern with friends coming to Kansas City: they default to whatever big hotel is closest to downtown or the highway, then wonder why the trip feels… forgettable.

KC isn’t a city you experience from a lobby or an elevator. The difference between a decent trip and a great one usually comes down to *where* you stay. Neighborhoods around Midtown and near the Plaza feel completely different from the airport or convention-center zones. You can walk to coffee, stumble into a great brunch spot, and actually feel like you’re in Kansas City instead of just passing through Missouri.

What surprised me is how much better the smaller places to stay in Kansas City Missouri can be compared to chain hotels. Some of the boutique hotels in Kansas City and older bed and breakfast Kansas City spots have way more personality, quieter nights, and hosts who actually care whether you enjoy your stay.

I used to think this stuff was overhyped until a short KC weekend getaway changed my mind completely. Staying closer to the neighborhoods made the city slower, warmer, and way more memorable.

KC just hits different when your stay feels intentional instead of convenient.",4,1765884708.0,missouri,5,0.75,False
1pnzocr,https://i.redd.it/xpgzkpdtxj7g1.jpeg,Hyperlocal Crypto Marketing Strategies for 2025 Engagement,"# Introduction
A broad advertising push can reach millions, yet an approach that speaks to people on the next block often converts more reliably. Hyperlocal tactics sit at the intersection of cryptocurrency’s digital nature and the very physical communities where potential users live, shop, and commute. When messaging references recognizable streets or familiar landmarks, abstract tokenomics start to feel practical and trustworthy.

## Why Local Focus Matters for Digital Assets
Cryptocurrency projects battle two simultaneous hurdles: extreme competition for attention online and widespread skepticism about real-world utility. Focusing on local contexts helps with both issues.

* Local references reduce perceived risk because the information connects to something tangible—an ATM in a convenience store, a café that accepts stablecoins, or a neighborhood NFT exhibit.
* Smaller, defined audiences allow clearer segmentation. Content can be tailored by demographic mix, average transaction size, or dominant languages spoken in one postal code.
* Community conversations surface faster. Feedback loops tighten when early adopters can be met at meetups or interviewed in person.

Several blockchain ventures have discovered that a few dozen enthusiastic participants in one city block can spark stronger network effects than thousands of passive social-media followers spread worldwide.

## Mapping Micro-Moments to Buyer Intent
Google popularized the idea of ""micro-moments""—the split seconds when a smartphone search turns curiosity into a decision. In crypto, common micro-moments include:

1. “Where can I buy Bitcoin near me?” during a lunch break.
2. “Is there an NFT gallery in this part of town?” while scrolling social media on public transit.
3. “Which coffee shops take USDC?” right before placing an order.

Supporting each moment requires information that loads quickly and answers the implied question in full. Marketers often structure content with FAQ blocks, concise directions, fee summaries, and operating hours. Voice search optimization counts as well; natural-language headings such as ""Best 24-hour crypto kiosks in Astoria"" align with how queries are spoken into smart speakers.

## Community-Driven Storytelling
Technical explanations produce awareness, but narratives create affinity. Community-based storytelling ties blockchain benefits to everyday scenarios:

* A local merchant may describe how stablecoins reduced cross-border remittance costs.
* Volunteers might share experiences using tokenized micro-donations to maintain a community garden.
* Artists could co-create neighborhood-themed NFTs whose royalties fund public art maintenance.

These vignettes substitute dry statistics with lived experience. Repetition across multiple channels—meetups, print flyers, short-form video—helps residents recognize peers rather than anonymous speculators.

## Geo-Targeted SEO Fundamentals
Search engines reward specificity. A page optimized for “crypto ATM Long Island” has less competition than one chasing the generic keyword “crypto ATM.” Key building blocks include:

* **Schema Markup**: LocalBusiness schemas clarify address, opening hours, and accepted payment methods, making it easier for mapping applications to display the listing.
* **Semantically Related Topics**: Grouping content on ATM safety, transaction fees, and step-by-step usage guides strengthens topical authority.
* **Conversational Headings**: Phrases resembling real questions (“How much does it cost to convert cash to ETH in Queens?”) improve voice results.
* **Internal Linking**: Articles on wallets, DeFi swaps, and tax guidelines interlink, encouraging deeper reading sessions and signaling completeness to search crawlers.

Regular audits remain essential because local search rankings can fluctuate when a new kiosk opens, a competitor gains more reviews, or search engine guidelines shift.

## Driving Physical Foot Traffic
Digital metrics alone rarely satisfy a business reliant on kiosk or retail sales. Hyperlocal content should therefore weave concrete directional cues into educational material:

* Mention the nearest subway lines or bus routes.
* Highlight parking availability or bike racks.
* Embed high-resolution interior photos so visitors know what to expect inside the store.

Supplementary tactics range from QR codes on street posters to short radio spots aired during commute hours. Each touchpoint points back to the same up-to-date landing page so that fees, limits, and hours remain consistent.

## Balancing Education With Compliance
Localized outreach does not excuse lax regulatory standards. Content that promotes cryptocurrencies in the United States must observe federal guidelines on disclosures and avoid unsubstantiated profit claims. Including clearly labeled risk statements and links to consumer-protection resources fosters trust. Translating disclaimers into the predominant local languages further demonstrates diligence.

## Measuring Success
Typical success metrics combine on-chain data and real-world observations:

* Wallet creations originating from a defined GPS radius.
* ATM cash-in volume segmented by hour and neighborhood.
* Event RSVP conversions relative to flyer distribution zones.
* Sentiment scores pulled from localized social-media listening.

Synthesizing these signals allows iterative optimization. For instance, if evening kiosk transactions dip while neighboring kiosks thrive, content can address safety perceptions or promote well-lit parking areas.

## Potential Limitations
Although hyperlocal strategies often accelerate adoption, several constraints apply:

* **Scalability**: Custom content for dozens of micro-markets demands constant upkeep.
* **Data Privacy**: Geotargeting must respect user consent and local regulations.
* **Cultural Nuances**: What works in one borough might misfire in another due to subtle differences in slang or social norms.

Testing strategies city by city helps determine which elements belong in a universal template and which require ground-level customization.

## Outlook for 2025
Mainstream payment apps have started offering crypto options, yet onboarding still stalls when perceived distance—literal or emotional—separates new users from their first transaction. Hyperlocal messaging works as a bridge, transforming intangible value propositions into daily conveniences. As more municipalities explore blockchain for records, permits, and community grants, neighborhood-centric narratives will likely become standard practice rather than niche experimentation.

# Key Takeaways
- Local references make decentralized technology feel tangible.
- Micro-moments demand concise answers optimized for voice and mobile.
- Storytelling centered on real residents builds credibility faster than global campaigns.
- Geo-targeted SEO and clear compliance disclosures remain foundational for sustainable growth.

Hyperlocal outreach may appear old-fashioned compared with metaverse billboards or global influencer streams. Still, when executed with accuracy and empathy, it often closes the gap between online curiosity and the first confirmed transaction.

1pnzkly,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1pnzkly/communication_rules_in_neurotypical_people/,Communication rules in neurotypical people: confusing!,"Hi everyone. English isn't my native language, so please forgive me if something doesn't make much sense.



I'm autistic; I was diagnosed a few years ago. Despite that, I'm a pretty sociable person, even though I'm on the spectrum, and I find it quite easy to make friends or meet people in ""natural"" settings. I went to therapy for many years, and I think that helped me. To be clear: I'm not saying it's wrong to be autistic and that it's difficult to interact with others.



But here's my problem: my mind works like a completely ""logical"" machine, and I apply those logical rules to all areas of my life, including personal relationships.



I recently started liking a girl from work (I'm a woman, so wlw) and I followed her on Instagram. The truth is, she didn't interact with me until this past weekend when we talked for THREE DAYS through voice messages and almost constant texts.



Well, she hasn't spoken to me since, haha. Here's where my problem with personal relationships comes in: In my mind, the logic is that if I talk to someone for three days, it's because I'm interested in them. If not, I end the conversation, and that's it. No big deal. The problem for an autistic woman like me is when neurotypical people talk for days on end because they're bored. I don't know if I'm explaining myself well.



For many neurotypical people, talking to someone for days on end isn't meaningful. My neurotypical friends have even confessed to me that they often talk to someone so much out of BOREDOM, and when they're no longer bored, they just stop talking to that person. Just like that.



This makes it very difficult for me to connect with women for anything romantic or casual, because many times they seem capable of having very long conversations without A LOGICAL PURPOSE. And for me, communication beyond being merely cordial has to have a logical purpose.



Disclaimer: obviously, I'm not forcing anyone to talk to me; I'm not a damn stalker. But I don't understand these neurotypical codes, where someone can talk to you for days without having any real interest in you.



So, how do you handle these situations? My example to explain this is like when neurotypical people say,



""Hey, yeah, we'll go for coffee sometime!"" and in reality, they'll NEVER do it because they're NOT interested in that person AT ALL. But they need to say these things in a friendly way. It's pointless.



PS: Obviously, this girl who talked to me for three days suddenly cut off all contact. My friends say it's the most normal thing in the world and that she was probably just bored or had some free time that weekend, and that's it. It's exhausting to interact like this.",4,1765884322.0,AutismInWomen,3,1.0,False
1pnzjii,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sapporo/comments/1pnzjii/3_hidden_cafés_in_sapporo_and_one_local_legend/,3 Hidden Cafés in Sapporo (and One Local Legend),"Here’s a list of cozy coffee spots that are best enjoyed alone or with one other quiet person.

They’re a bit off the beaten path — perfect if you’re looking to explore non-touristy areas.

*The menus are simple, so even translation apps should work fine!*



**Lizard Coffee (Soen / 桑園)**

A relaxed and casual atmosphere, similar to a coffee stand. You can enjoy great single-origin coffee for just ¥500–¥550.

They also offer scones (around ¥300) in a few flavors — subtly flavored, with a lovely crispy outside and fluffy inside.

It’s a quiet, comfortable place with both Wi-Fi and power outlets — quite a rare find in Sapporo.

**Drop In Cafe (Hiragishi / 平岸)**

The interior is dim and understated — you might wonder if it’s even open — but once inside, it’s a calm and cozy space.

The pudding is average, but the coffee, bread, and cakes are excellent.

Especially notable is the homemade bread with cheese: it’s not your usual sweet or fluffy kind, but pairs wonderfully with coffee.

**Cafe Lon (Ropeway Entrance / ロープウェイ入口)**

The moment you enter, you can tell this place takes its coffee seriously — the first sip hits you with depth.

The modern interior may feel a little cold in winter, but the house blend was so good I couldn’t resist buying a bag of beans.

They don’t serve food, just coffee and small sweets — it’s a space purely for savoring the drink.

[https://www.instagram.com/cafe\_lon/](https://www.instagram.com/cafe_lon/)



**Hall of Fame:** 

**Café Noël (Fukuzumi / 福住)**

Unless you have a car, getting here means taking the subway and then a connecting bus.

But I still find myself coming back again and again — because it’s just that comfortable.

The coffee won’t blow you away with bold richness or sharp acidity, but rather warms your soul with quiet depth.

There are probably trendier places for bread or cake, but here, they’re perfectly matched to the cozy atmosphere.

It’s a place that offers deep, gentle peace.

Not looking for anything weird or forced, just genuine conversations, coffee, walks, or meeting like-minded female (25-50) or Couple around the city. Could be tech folks, creatives, readers, fitness enthusiasts, or anyone who enjoys good conversation.

1pnzg3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1pnzg3j/does_coffee_make_anyone_else_sleepier/,Does coffee make anyone else sleepier?,"So idk if it's just me, but I've never had a problem where I drink coffee too late and can't fall asleep. Like just today I was really tired but had to get some work done and drank like a huge mug of instant coffee. But my house was really cold so I went to my bed and lay under the covers for like a few seconds. Next thing I know it's 10pm and I've just slept for 4 hours and got nothing done. Like this was literally right after I drank my entire cup of coffee too did I fall asleep. And this isn't an isolated circumstance. Whenever I drink coffee in the morning I always get a little bit drowsier/mellow. Like if I drink coffee in the morning I will 100% doze off on the car ride to school. If I don't drink my coffee then I lowkey don't get that wash of sleepiness which I know sounds illogical but that's just how my body reacts to caffeine. I will say coffee always helps in the afternoon for me as if I don't drink coffee I sometimes feel awful by 1pm and can't stop yawning but coffee mitigates the effects of afternoon fatgiue and helps me function way better.

So I wanted to know does anyone else experience this? Like right after I drink coffee for like 30 minutes to maybe like 2 hours I feel way more sleepy. Not in a way where horrible fatigue hits me and I can't stop yawning but where if I see a comfortable surface I can't help but lay down and have a huge desire to just rest. It's like a soft drowsiness washes over me. Does coffee do this to anyone else? Does it really effect people falling asleep if they drink it too late? I used to be really scared of drinking coffee too late because I heard horror stories of people being unable to fall asleep, but now I don't care anymore because caffeine really doesn't seem to hurt me that much and I'm wondering if the idea that caffeine can impact your sleep really is true.",14,1765883859.0,NoStupidQuestions,22,0.89,False

Now I’m curious why there’s not a Dunkin here and if anyone else shares in my sadness? Every time I asked where to get a donut around here I get told Walmart, some small coffee shop that’s not even open past 11am on the weekends, and to get “fricked” because there’s no donuts here. How can a city of this size and magnitude have made it this far with no donuts. wtf are the cops doing when they’re sitting on the highway if not eating a delicious Dunkin donut?! Is it a supply chain issue? You can’t tell me that a country that runs on Dunkin doesn’t have a dunking 20 mins out from one of its biggest (maybe literally?) and most famous historical landmarks.

1pnz77z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pnz77z/aita_27f_for_expecting_more_out_of_my_parter_27m/,AITA (27F) for expecting more out of my parter (27M)?,"Hi everyone. I come to you frustrated, overwhelmed, and exhausted. My parter and I have been together almost 10 years. We started dating right after high school. We were best friends in HS and grew up going to school together. We bought a house together ~3 years ago, have 2 dogs, an investment property and we own our home. 

Within the past year or so, I’ve been dealing with some intense anxiety. Ive always been an anxious girly, but unfortunately with age, its seeming to get worse. About a year ago, I had my first real discussion with my partner about needing more from him. I felt like our house was a mess and only got cleaned if I decided to clean it. He was leaving clothes all over the floor, dishes around the house (mostly mugs from coffee), and wouldnt do much other than his normal “outdoor chores” ie. Mow the lawn, repair things both in and out of the house if it needed , mow our investment property, etc. We both had an emotional discussion, each having our time to cry and get things off of our chest. He said he’d do better, and that I am his top priority. Things got better and then slowly (I’d say within a month, things went back to normal.)
Fast forward to about a month ago, we had another very emotional (this was mostly filled with anger from myself) discussion and I stated that I’ve thought about what life would be like if we split up and lived in separate houses. I said I was sick of doing all of the housework (cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc. on top of the mental load I feel I carry) and working part time. I work full time not by choice, but because I started my own business 2.5 years ago in the beauty industry, so I take the work as it comes, making my actual hours ~20 per week. Because of this, I do more of the house work. It makes the most sense for me to have slightly more responsibility since he has a job where he works 40-50 hrs per week. When we first bought our home, I had a normal 9-5 job, and he had his own landscaping business, and I remember still doing primarily most of the “indoor” house work. But now I think it makes more sense. So I make sure to cook most of our meals. 
We’ve discussed what I need from him, which at the end of the day is respect. I feel like I go out of my way to do things to make his life easier and I dont always feel like he does the same. After our recent talk, he has started helping with dishes that have piled up (although it seems like it’s already slowed down) & will straighten up the house, and does his own laundry. The problem is, I still feel like there is a lack of respect or urgency for some things. For example, I have to ask things in certain ways if I need extra help and dont want him getting offended. Just the other day, he asked if I’d make him a coffee while I was making us breakfast, so I said yes but would you mind taking the trash out? Its full. He said yes, but didnt come in to do it.. so I did it myself and went into full rage mode. His lack of urgency grinds my gears like no other. The trash was so full I couldnt shut the lid. We have dogs, so it needed done WHEN I ASKED. Not when he felt like it. He asked why I got so mad, and that he woulve gotten to it in a couple of hours because our outdoor cans were full and he was going to take them to our dumpster at our investment property that day and would bring them back inside and then take our trash out after that. I understood afterward why he waited I suppose but it still needed done urgently and at least set out in the garage for the time being. Or at least in my mind it did. Just this morning, he let our dogs whine and whine and it woke me up, so again in a rage, I went downstairs and let them out at 5am (usually one of his responsibilities since hes supposed to be getting ready for work then.) 
I guess I’m just not sure if I have something mental (possibly OCD or PMDD) to where I am overreacting and the rage is taking over so that I dont see these situations clearly, or if there is just a lack of respect or care for my needs. I think I have unrealistic expectations of what a man should do. Of course every girl wants treated like a princess. He takes care of us financially and works hard at his job. I really would like to give him more grace but I oftentimes feel like I’m raising a child. I dont want to have children with him because I think I’d be miserable and stuck with much of the responsibilities. Side note, our sex life is not good. It happens maybe once a month and we’ve talked about it and he of course would like it to happen more often but its hard for me to want that given the circumstances and due to my lack of confidence lately. I have gained ~40 lbs since high school which isnt horrible but I’m definitely not feeling my best as of late. This anxiety doesnt help so I’d like to get to the bottom of my issues and make some lifestyle changes. 
 I’m sure I left a ton out, and Im sorry to ramble, but I’d love advice that isnt from my biased (but lovely) mother. ",2,1765882986.0,AITAH,11,0.75,False
1pnz77j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pnz77j/typical_boyfriend/,Typical boyfriend,"I tried dating after you  someone more my type, the kind of guy who made things easy, the kind who made you smile just by existing. We were similar, not the same. He liked his coffee black and watched 2000s rom-coms with the kind of comfort that felt safe just like I did. He played football, exactly the way I once imagined my future boyfriend would. Wavy brown hair, caramel skin he looked like a picture I had already framed in my head. We didn’t love the same music, but he learned mine anyway, put my songs on when I was with him like they mattered just because I did. He smiled in a way that reached his eyes, laughed without holding anything back. He liked me openly not afraid, not hidden, not careful. He held my hand and kissed it in front of his teammates, brought me flowers every time we met, stayed awake on calls just so he could watch me fall asleep first. He asked if I was okay and waited for the real answer. He chose me, patiently, loudly. Nothing like you ever were. 

And yet, through all of it, you were everywhere. I remembered how you hated coffee, how action movies were your comfort, how staying in and playing Fortnite together felt like enough. You were nothing like the person I thought I would fall for, and somehow everything I needed still led back to you. Every song I loved traced its way to your name. How I missed the quietness in which you loved me, the way your hand found mine without either of us noticing, the way time disappeared when we were together. We didn’t stay awake on purpose  we just couldn’t bring ourselves to say goodnight. I remember how you said your dog loved me, how you always knew something was wrong before I could even say it. I remember you picking flowers yourself on the way to see me, like love didn’t need an announcement.

And that’s the part that scares me knowing that I found someone who did everything right and still felt wrong because he wasn’t you. Knowing I could be adored in the open and still ache for the way you loved me when no one was looking.  ",1,1765882984.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

She talks chaotic but somehow sweet, straight up self-obsessed energy.

The starting dialogue is wide open, you can steer the conversation wherever you want.

Her black Hello Kitty painted Ferrari randomly dies, and you (stranger) just happen to walk by. She flashes golden eyes and asks for help. You can be literally anyone: mechanic, office worker, tourist, celebrity, whatever.

From there, the conversation can go in endless directions:

* Fixing the car together 
* Calling a tow truck and waiting together (I don't know? flirting time?)
* Grabbing coffee at a nearby café while roadside assistance comes
* Her offering you a ride once it’s fixed (as thanks)
* Exchange numbers for “just in case it happens again” and go text mode?
* Calling for another help (Another Kin in the Group chat)
* Or whatever wild twist you throw in

There’s something unusual about Udaipur’s cafés—something that doesn’t announce itself loudly, yet you feel it the moment you settle into a chair on a terrace overlooking the lake. It might be the softness in the air, or the way the city seems to move slower than most places. Travelers often comment on it without even knowing they’re doing so. They stare a little longer at the water, speak a bit more gently, and forget the tension they carried from elsewhere.

And that’s probably where the charm begins.

The city isn’t trying to impress anyone. It just breathes naturally, letting the light fall wherever it wishes. Rooftops catch it differently throughout the day—morning light is shy, afternoon turns reflective, and evenings wrap everything in a warm gold. Many visitors who explore the **best cafes and rooftop restaurants in Udaipur** find themselves staying longer than planned because the views do half the talking for them.

Even [Solis Nature](https://solisnature.com/), known for curating nature-forward stays, somehow aligns perfectly with this mood. The brand believes in slow, scenic, mindful travel. Udaipur believes in the same thing, without ever saying a word.

# The Easy Calm of Udaipur’s Café Scene

In most cities, cafés feel like places where you stop, order, and move on. Here, they feel more like pauses in someone’s story. People curl up with a book, watch boats glide across Lake Pichola, or just… sit. It’s rare to see someone rush. Even rarer to see someone checking the time.

Perhaps that’s why the **best cafes in Udaipur** have gained such a reputation. They aren’t just cafés—they’re little breathers. Corners where strangers find themselves rewriting plans because sitting here feels better than anything else scheduled.

# When Nature Steps In Quietly

It’s easy to forget how important surroundings are until you experience a place like Udaipur. Here, mountains gather around the city as if to protect it. The lake holds reflections more calmly than most bodies of water. Even the wind behaves differently—it arrives, lingers for a moment, then leaves without disturbing anything.

This gentle connection is exactly **how Udaipur’s natural beauty enhances café culture**. It doesn’t need to claim credit; it simply exists, and everything else falls into place. The [stays in Udaipur](https://solisnature.com/property/exploring?city_id=3532) also give away the same kind of energy, If this is the energy that you are looking for then go check out Solis Nature’s Udaipur stays. 

# Cafés & Rooftops That Hold Their Own Stories

The city has many cafés, but a handful of them keep showing up in conversations between travelers. Not because they are “famous” or “trendy,” but because they stay with people long after the trip ends. Each one feels like it belongs to someone’s personal memory.

Here’s a list—though not a strict one. More like a collection of places where people have smiled, paused, and let their thoughts wander. These cafés and terraces carry the essence of what makes Udaipur feel both intimate and open at the same time.

# 1. Upré by 1559 AD

There’s a quiet sophistication here. Lamps glow just enough, and the terrace curves gently around a view that never disappoints. Even those exploring **udaipur rooftop restaurants for couples** find Upré unexpectedly romantic—not the dramatic kind, but the soft, trusting kind.

The lake sits in front like an old friend. Sometimes still, sometimes shimmering. Always comforting.

# 2. Jheel’s Ginger Coffee Bar & Bakery

People often stumble upon this spot while looking for something entirely different. Yet once they see the water brushing gently against the steps below, they tend to stay longer than intended. It isn’t exactly a rooftop, but honestly, it doesn’t need to be. Jheel’s has become one of the most **instagrammable cafes in Udaipur** simply because its simplicity frames the lake beautifully.

If someone is planning to read or work or dream, this is where they usually end up.

# 3. Rainbow Restaurant

Rainbow feels like sunlight decided to settle down and open a café. Bright, cheerful, colorful—nothing extravagant, yet instantly likable. The rooftop is casual, like a friend’s terrace where you feel comfortable dropping your bag and sitting wherever your heart chooses.

Many first-time visitors say this place is when they finally understood **why travellers love Udaipur’s relaxed café vibe**.

# 4. Harigarh Restaurant

Some evenings call for a slightly richer mood—warm lights, heritage walls, a slower dinner. Harigarh offers that without ever seeming too grand. People come here when they want dinner that blends into a moment. The terrace is perfect for a mellow, memory-making **candlelight dinner in Udaipur**.

# 5. Oli Café & Bistro

If you like trendy spaces that aren’t trying too hard, Oli might feel familiar in a comforting way. Young travelers particularly appreciate this café. It has that “creative yet calm” feel, offering corners where conversations stretch naturally.

It also explains **why Udaipur cafés are perfect for photography lovers**—the textures, colors, and soft lighting create frames you don’t need to plan.

# 6. Cafe Grasswood

Grasswood is the kind of place that doesn’t need heavy décor to create warmth. Something about the slightly rustic feel, the friendly staff, and the everyday coziness makes it one of the most beloved **must-visit cafes in Udaipur**.

It isn’t flashy; it’s familiar. And sometimes that’s exactly what a traveler needs.

# 7. Sun & Moon Rooftop Café

This place is a surprise—not because it hides, but because it doesn’t demand attention. Sun & Moon feels like a rooftop where the city opens up quietly. The wind stays kind. The view stays humble. The atmosphere doesn’t shift much even when the crowd does.

People often describe it as one of those **hidden rooftop gems in Udaipur** that stays in your memory for no particular reason—but very strongly.

# 8. Jaiwana Haveli Rooftop

There’s a moment around sunset when Jaiwana Haveli’s rooftop becomes almost too beautiful to believe. Couples sit closer. Friends fall silent for a few minutes. Even families pause between conversations.

Those searching for **best rooftop restaurants in Udaipur with lake view** often end up saying they didn’t expect the view to feel so personal.

# 9. The Artist House

Half café, half creative sanctuary—that’s probably the easiest way to describe The Artist House. Paintings, conversations, mismatched chairs, the smell of coffee… everything blends like its own kind of quiet music. It attracts those who like places with character.

It’s easy to lose track of time here.

# 10. Tribute

Tribute sits by the water, calm and confident. It celebrates horses, history, and nature in its own way. The outdoor seating lets the breeze in, and evenings feel like they’re wrapped in a soft hush. It’s unmistakably one of the strongest examples of **nature-inspired dining in Udaipur**.

# Why Rooftops Feel Different in This City

When people talk about **why Udaipur rooftop dining feels special**, the answer rarely follows a single line. It’s never just the view or the food. It’s the way the evening light spreads across the lake like melted gold. It’s the faint temple bells. The boats drifting slowly. The silhouettes of palaces glowing in warm yellow.

The city doesn’t rush its nights. And that gives rooftops the freedom to become more than just spaces for eating.

# For the Love of Photographs

Modern travelers often chase moments that feel meaningful, especially ones that translate well into photographs. Udaipur offers both effortlessly. Even a simple wooden railing or a slice of sky between two old walls becomes a frame worth capturing.

This is where the **importance of choosing cafés with a good view + vibe** really shows. Cafés here don’t try to imitate each other; they let the city do the styling for them. Udaipur in itself got that photography vibe to it and honestly I think that is all of Rajasthan for you, so check out our [Rajasthan Travel Guide](https://solisnature.com/blog/category/rajasthan-guide/) to make the most out of your next Rajasthan trip. 

# So, What Makes Udaipur Cafes Unique?

Maybe it’s the balance between nature and heritage. Maybe it’s the way cafés and rooftops open themselves fully to the sky instead of hiding behind walls. Or maybe it’s the gentle invitation the city extends, encouraging travelers to slow down for a moment and breathe properly.

Whatever the reason, one thing is certain: Udaipur cafés create memories effortlessly.

They are scenic without being flashy, warm without being overwhelming, and beautifully imperfect—just like the moments that stay with us long after a trip.

Solis Nature often highlights destinations that feel connected to nature, and Udaipur is one of those rare places where nature and comfort meet halfway. Not loudly, but tenderly. And travelers feel that.

If there’s one thing anyone should do in Udaipur, it’s sit at a rooftop around sunset, watch the lake change colors, and let the evening unfold at its own pace. It’s a small thing, but somehow, it becomes the part people remember the most.

# FAQs: Best Cafes and Rooftop Restaurants in Udaipur

# 1. Which cafés in Udaipur have the best lake views?

Travelers on Quora often say that places near Lake Pichola offer the most rewarding views. Cafés like **Upré**, **Jheel’s Ginger Coffee Bar**, and **Jaiwana Haveli Rooftop** are mentioned repeatedly for their clean angles of the water, boats, and sunsets. These spots stay memorable because the view doesn’t feel crowded or obstructed.

# 2. Are rooftop restaurants in Udaipur safe for families and seniors?

Most rooftop cafés in Udaipur are safe and thoughtfully designed. Places like **Harigarh Restaurant**, **Jaiwana Haveli Rooftop**, and **Tribute** have comfortable seating, railings, and calmer atmospheres suitable for families. Even during peak hours, the vibe stays controlled and gentle, which is why many families recommend them on traveler forums.

# 3. Is Udaipur expensive when it comes to cafés and rooftop dining?

Not really. Reddit threads often mention that Udaipur cafés offer a wide price range. You can sip a coffee at Jheel’s for under ₹200, enjoy a full dinner at Harigarh for reasonable rates, or go premium at Upré if you want a more elevated evening. The city caters to students, solo travelers, couples, and families without forcing luxury pricing.

# 4. Which cafés are best for couples looking for a romantic sunset?

Couples almost always point toward **Upré**, **Jaiwana Haveli Rooftop**, and **Sun & Moon Café**. These spots capture the golden hour perfectly — calm lake, warm lights, and that slow-breathing Udaipur hush. No loud music, no distractions. Just the city turning softer with the evening light.

# 5. Are there any hidden or lesser-known cafés in Udaipur worth trying?

Yes. Café Grasswood, Sun & Moon Café, Oli Café, and The Artist House often show up in Reddit and Quora conversations as “unexpected surprises.” They’re quieter, less commercial, and perfect for people who prefer intimate corners over mainstream rush. Travelers love these because they feel personal — like stumbling upon a secret spot.

# 6. Do these cafés allow long sitting for reading or working?

Many travelers say Udaipur cafés are surprisingly chill about long sits. Jheel’s, The Artist House, and Oli Café are great options for reading, journaling, or working quietly. Staff rarely rush you unless there is extreme weekend crowd. The lake-facing spots make it easier to sink into your own thoughts without distractions.

# 7. What time is best to visit Udaipur rooftops for the perfect view?

Sunset is magical — the lake goes from silver to gold while the city lights slowly wake up. But mornings are equally peaceful if you like quiet spaces with soft sunlight. Most travel forums say **4 to 7 PM** is the sweet spot if you want the full rooftop experience.

# 8. Are vegetarian options easily available in Udaipur cafés?

Absolutely. Udaipur is known for its rich vegetarian culture. Most cafés and rooftops — Rainbow Restaurant, Jheel’s, Grasswood, Jaiwana Haveli — have extensive vegetarian menus, and many dishes have Jain-friendly versions as well. Even international cafés offer veg-heavy options like pasta, pancakes, and salads.

# 9. Which cafés are best for photography lovers?

Jheel’s, Upré, Rainbow Restaurant, and The Artist House stand out on traveler forums. The combination of lake reflections, pastel skies, heritage walls, and warm lighting makes photos look effortlessly aesthetic. Even simple candid shots turn into frame-worthy memories.

# 10. Do rooftops in Udaipur get crowded during peak tourist season?

Yes. From October to February, Udaipur sees a rush — especially around sunset. Most Reddit users suggest reaching **30–45 minutes early** to find a good spot. Weekdays are calmer, but weekends fill up quickly. If someone loves quieter experiences, Solis Nature’s curated stays help position travelers near less crowded cafés and viewpoints.

*Mark Smith & Alex Guthrie speak about the Elk Creek project having received a $10 million in Pentagon funding and is under active consideration by the U.S. Export-Import Bank for up to $780 million in potential project financing, positioning Elk Creek to become a key domestic source of critical minerals for the U.S. defense and manufacturing base once operational.*

[NioCorp (Nasdaq: NB) | The Race to Onshore Critical Minerals Presentation Replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wVQOUulNEI)

***The Puzzle pieces are starting to come together showing how the Elk Creek project is designed to supply materials central to modern defense, aerospace, robotics, AI, and energy technologies while reducing America’s reliance on foreign sources. NioCorp has also partnered with Lockheed Martin and its Skunk Works® division on a new Pentagon-funded defense technology program developing aluminum-scandium alloy components for next-generation fighter aircraft.***

***With that being stated I wanted to take a peek at how the FEA IP acquisition, Nanoscale, Creative Engineers & Lockheed ScAl alloy works might all meld together... ""Speculatively of course...!""***

[For 30 years, every aerospace, EV, and defense prime has said the same thing about scandium: “We can’t design Sc-Al alloys into next-gen systems until there’s a reliable U.S. supply.” & “ We can’t build a U.S. supply until someone commits to using the alloys.”  That deadlock is exactly what stalled the entire U.S. scandium industry… until now. \~Niocorp just broke the loop. NioCorp solved SCANDIUM'S \\""The Chicken or the Egg problem!\\"" & are working to produce alloys to make \\""STUFF!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1pnz3mv/video/32olb1ifoj7g1/player)

***\*\*\*FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS AS ALWAYS:***

# 🚀 2026 Is the Year: Why NioCorp’s FEA IP + NAMA Change the Game for U.S. Defense Materials

**The Breakthrough — What FEA IP Actually Is (and Why China/Russia Can’t Match It)**  
For 50 years, Scandium stayed niche because the legacy China/Russia model is brute-force metallurgy: mine → oxide → metal → melt → re-melt → alloy. It’s energy-intensive, batch-based, and fundamentally unscalable. FEA’s IP—now owned by NioCorp via NAMA—cuts out the weakest link entirely. Instead of making pure scandium metal, the process introduces scandium oxide *directly into molten aluminum (or titanium)* and removes oxygen in situ, forming a high-quality Al-Sc master alloy in one controlled step. Fewer furnaces, fewer melts, far lower CAPEX, and—most critically—a process that scales linearly and continuously. This is why Mark Smith called it a major de-risking event for scandium economics. It actually is.

[This is why Mark Smith called it a \\""major de-risking event for scandium economics!\\"" It actually is!!!](https://reddit.com/link/1pnz3mv/video/ud9mlw41pj7g1/player)

**Why This Is Different from Nanoscale / AM Specialists (They Stack, They Don’t Compete)**  
FEA/NAMA sits *upstream*: primary alloy production at industrial scale. Nanoscale and Creative Engineers live *downstream*: turning that alloy into ultra-fine powders, additive-manufactured components, and microstructure-optimized parts. Think of it as a vertical ladder: FEA makes affordable, defense-grade Sc-Al (and beyond); AM specialists turn it into elite components. One feeds the other. Together, they form a complete domestic alloy-to-part pipeline—something China has, and the U.S. hasn’t… until now.

[NAMA-FEA IP & NANOSCALE & CREATIVE ENGINEERS = ALLOYS & POWDERS TO MAKE STUFF!](https://reddit.com/link/1pnz3mv/video/rym2dumbpj7g1/player)

**Beyond Sc-Al: The Alloy Roadmap Everyone Might not see...**  
***Sc-Al might just be the opening move.*** The same oxide-to-melt architecture enables **Sc-Ti** (the real aerospace prize) and, longer-term, **Sc-Nb** systems. Sc-Ti improves grain stability, weldability, fatigue, and creep resistance—exactly what hypersonics, NGAD core structures, and space systems demand. Sc-Nb lives deeper in the high-temperature, classified defense space. Rare earths like Nd/Pr, Dy, and Tb do *not* belong in structural alloys\*\*—but they\*\* ***do*** **anchor the magnet side of the stack** (motors, actuators, guidance, radar). **Elk Creek is designed to feed** ***both*** **lanes—intentionally modular, intentionally financeable.**

**Why NAMA Exists (and Why the DFS Can’t Capture This Upside)**  
NAMA isn’t a side project—it’s the control vehicle. NioCorp owns the mine, the oxides, and now the alloy IP. **That allows NAMA to JV with prime**s (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop or others), receive Title III funding, build dedicated alloy facilities, license selectively, and keep pricing power. Because the FEA process works with *any* scandium oxide source, NAMA can potentially produce alloy **before Elk Creek is online**, support Lockheed qualification now, and generate pre-mine revenue. That is exceptionally rare in mining—and exactly why this upside lives *outside* the DFS.

[Lockheed, Skunk Works®, and Why 2026 Matters\~ In the RedChip video above Alex Guthrie put a stake in the ground!—February 2026: “First Metal time.” That’s the inflection from story to execution. \~ \\""STAYING TUNED!\\""\~](https://reddit.com/link/1pnz3mv/video/64f3lc93rj7g1/player)

**Lockheed, Skunk Works®, and Why 2026 Matters**  
This is no longer hypothetical. NioCorp is partnered with **Lockheed Martin and Skunk Works®** on a Pentagon-funded program developing aluminum-scandium components for next-gen fighters. In the December 10, 2025 RedChip presentation, management tied the strategy together: Elk Creek as the feedstock spine; FEA/NAMA as the alloy engine; AM partners as the performance layer. During Q&A, Alex Guthrie put a stake in the ground—**February 2026: “first metal time.”** That’s the inflection from story to execution.

**The Big Picture (Why This Is Architecture, Not Hype)**  
China built dominance by vertically integrating mine → oxide → metal → alloy → magnet. NioCorp is building the same architecture—without IP theft, without geopolitical risk, and with DoD trust baked in. Sc-Al drives scale programs; Sc-Ti feeds hypersonics and NGAD; REEs feed magnets; recycling closes the loop. Lockheed anchors demand, DoD anchors funding, and NAMA controls the choke points.

**Bottom line:** 2026 isn’t discovery—it’s deployment. The pieces aren’t “coming together.” **They’re already interlocked!**

***This is how we rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.**  
The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

# NioCorp isn’t just part of the solution — it’s the platform the solution gets built on!

# ⚙️ Elk Creek is a U.S. National Security Asset!

I already experienced a lot of emotions, a lot of heights, a lot of lows, I experimented with coffee and without coffee and I’m slowly trying to decrease caffeine and increase medication intake together with my psychiatrist.

right now, I have my planned crash day, my day off and I’m seriously considering not taking my meds today because I feel much more like myself even though myself is tired and unmotivated.

If I don’t take my medication, I’m allowed to drink coffee and I’m actually looking forward to it. My point is: how can you not know whether you have had taken your medicine today or not? I read a lot of memes or comments or just general stuff online of ADHD people that are talking about “hee hee ha ha I don’t know if I have taken my meds yet I just can’t remember.” and I cannot understand this.

If I’ve taken my meds I can feel its effect after one hour and actually after 30 minutes the calmness creeps in and I’m much more able to just do life in general and I’m so happy for it. 

Because I’m probably not on the right amount yet or because I’m still in the process of finding the right doses for me, I also experience bodily sensations, like pressure in my eyes or forehead or heavy breathing or just like an overall weird sensation and I know that I am a sensitive person, but I definitely know when I have taken my meds.

At the same time it’s such a trade-off also because I don’t always feel good when I take my meds. I just don’t feel anything at all, but I’m getting my shit done and when I’m not taking my meds, I don’t get shit done, but at least I feel a lot more.

I know it’s still in the process of titration and finding the right amount of medicine that works for my body, but I wonder how it would feel like genuinely not knowing whether I have taken it or not. What’s up with that? What’s your experience?

I feel like screaming  
straight into the busted speaker  
of the sky—

full volume,  
all caps,  
no filter—

but the sound just folds  
like a bad paper airplane  
and crashes  
inside my skull.

So I bow my head  
like a tired prophet  
praying to the typewriter  
and let my throat  
turn into ink.

Tap-tap-tap—  
little iron horses  
running wild  
across a snowfield of paper.

Every line  
waters down the original howl,  
cheap whiskey  
left open in the rain,

but still I pour it,  
still I drink it,  
still I write it.

When I speak,  
my truth hits the floor  
like a bowling ball  
in a library—  
heavy,  
and everyone pretends  
they didn’t hear it.

But when I write,  
suddenly I’m “brilliant,”  
“so deep,”  
like they just saw God  
in a coffee stain  
on a napkin.

And I’m still here,  
pixel ghost  
in the corner  
of my own life,  
buffering  
at the edge  
of everything.

I took the road  
with no name,  
some forgotten backstreet  
where the streetlamp hums  
like a tired insect

and broken glass  
winks up at me,  
like, *hey kid,*  
*you sure?*

The future splits in two:  
Door A,  
Door B,  
same chipped paint,  
same flickering EXIT sign.

Is one of them you,  
or just another rerun dream  
they play at 3 a.m.  
after everyone normal  
has gone to sleep?

My heart is a hitchhiker  
on a highway  
that might not exist,  
thumb out,

waiting for a car made of rain  
driven by a ghost  
with my eyes.

Destination,  
scribbled in smeared pencil:  
“Anywhere but here.”

I’m swimming through  
a sea of lies—  
neon, glossy,  
pre-packaged truths  
on billboards and timelines—

none of them mine,  
but they cling to my skin  
like motel smoke  
in secondhand lungs.

Some nights I swear  
I hear a click  
in the cosmic switchboard,

like the universe  
leans over and says,  
*that’s enough now, kid,*  
*you’ve glowed enough,*  
*time to dim.*

Maybe that’s mercy.  
Maybe it’s just  
another broken vending machine  
that swallowed my last coin  
and kept the candy.

Why do I keep  
holding on to people  
like a drowning man  
hugging a sinking refrigerator  
in this flooded kitchen of a life?

I lost everything—  
it wasn’t much,

just a handful of dollar-store stars  
taped to the inside  
of my ribs—

but they were mine,  
outlaw Christmas lights  
in a run-down  
rented heart.

I thought love  
was meant to be broadcast,  
pirate radio  
from the rooftop—

barefoot,  
city wind in my teeth,  
shouting,

*hey world,*  
*I found something holy.*

But the world  
took a drag of its cigarette,  
squinted,

said, *cute,*

and turned the volume up  
on something louder,  
easier,  
not me.

So now solitude  
starts to look sacred,  
a one-person chapel  
with flickering candles  
and a cross made  
of broken pencils.

No friends,  
no family,  
no lover—

no one left  
to twist the knife  
but my own hands,  
learning the choreography  
in the mirror.

I’d pack my bags,  
take the last bus  
to Nowhere Special,

but memories ride free.  
They slip through zippers,  
curl in side pockets,  
sit beside me  
with old-movie eyes

and play home videos  
on the smeared window glass.

So I leave it all  
where it hangs:

photos like pinned moths,  
wings faded  
still trying;

conversations unraveling  
on dusty coat hooks;

ghosts smoking  
in the doorframes  
of apartments  
that don’t exist  
anymore.

This isn’t the life I ordered.  
If something brighter  
was meant for these hands,  
I must’ve left it  
in a library book  
I never returned—

overdue prophecy  
gathering dust  
on a forgotten shelf.

No new chances,  
no neon rebirth—

just an empty seat  
behind my ribs  
where my heart  
used to drum jazz,

and now it taps softly,  
like it’s apologizing  
for still being here.

When love finally showed up,  
it didn’t wear fireworks,  
just tired shoulders  
and a quiet voice.

And me—  
half-packed,  
half-broken,  
half-believing—

I let it sift  
through my fingers  
like cold beach sand  
in November,

hands too numb  
to hold on right.

Told myself  
they felt it too,  
same voltage,  
same hymn—

but some dances  
are solo acts  
masquerading as duets,

and you only find out  
when the music stops  
and you’re still spinning.

So I swear to myself  
in a 3 a.m. diner,  
coffee gone cold,  
napkin full of frantic ink:

never again  
will I hand my trust  
to anyone walking this earth

without checking  
the fine print  
on their silences.

The fear I carried  
like a pocketknife  
finally clinks  
onto the table,

blade open,  
metal honest,

and whispers,

*see?*  
*you knew I was here*  
*the whole time.*

One day death will knock—  
cool hat,  
raincoat,

like a character  
from a paperback  
no one finished reading—

and ask,  
*you ready to go, kid?*

And some cracked part of me  
will want to say yes,  
just to hear  
what silence sounds like  
from the inside.

I never learned the rules—  
not for life,  
not for love,  
not for this bright,  
stubborn ache  
called being human.

Hope and faith  
caught an early Greyhound,  
left a note on the pillow:

*don’t wait up.*  
*we needed a break*  
*from all this.*

Now I tuck myself in  
with small, trembling lies:

*it was real.*  
*it mattered.*  
*you weren’t crazy*  
*for wanting more.*

The words snag  
in my throat—

a sharp, quiet hitch,

like trying not to cry  
under supermarket lights  
between cereal  
and dish soap.

I just want to remember  
what it felt like  
to exist  
without splintering,

to be whole  
for longer  
than a borrowed heartbeat  
in a borrowed body.

So I step offstage,  
into the alleyway air,  
moon hanging crooked  
like a busted streetlamp,

and sorrow pads behind me  
like a skinny grey cat,  
eyes bright,  
saying nothing,  
refusing to leave.

New road,  
same dark,  
maybe darker—

but I can’t keep sleeping  
in yesterday’s wreckage,  
curled on the floor  
of burned-out rooms,

pretending the ashes  
are a mattress.

So I walk.

Head up.  
Voice cracked,  
unmuted.

Beat by beat.  
Step by step.

Past tense shrinking  
in the rearview,  
future still a blank page  
flapping like a wild flag,

and this voice—

stubborn,  
ragged,  
mixtape of a voice—

still here,  
still spilling ink,  
still refusing  
to disappear  
into anyone’s

A perfect morning.,"It was the usual Monday Morning, that rush and drive that comes with it wasn't far fetched. People bustled in and out of the cafe, their feet walking faster than their shadow as they hurried to pick up their coffee and make it in time for their appointments.

One thing I loved about the cafe is the setting and ambience it brought. They had different furniture: the round coffee table, a cushion and even the long table facing the transparent glass.

Each furniture is neatly arranged acros space brown padded floor. The walls were painted cream to give it that sense of homely vibe, the kind that makes you feel like you're not in your real world but in grandma’s kitchen. 

Asides the coffee and snacks sold here, this cafe is also known as the best workspace amongst the remote workers community especially on Mondays. The community has successfully divided the cafe into different categories like products filtered on Alibaba. 

The developers and designers sit at the far end of the room away from the noise as they need the peace and quiet most times. Content creators and social media managers sit in the middle as they use others for their content props whilst other customers fill in the blank spaces of the remaining seats.

In all, everyone is left happy, enjoying the company of others and the snacks they've ordered.",3,1765881972.0,cafe,0,1.0,False

Exhaustion hollowed him out without granting sleep. His body felt as if it were rotting inward, his imagination obligingly supplied the sound of organs keening in discordant chorus. Each morning he expelled a black, tar-like substance, as if something deeper than sickness were trying to leave him.




A phone rang—shrill, drilling, punitive. He hid from it, rehearsing the worst possible conversations, then despised himself when silence returned. Searching for an anchor, he found only words gouged into the wall: Rot creeps where I thought I rested.




He vomited often; it was the only act that felt purposeful. Today nothing came—only dry convulsions and thin, involuntary whimpers. Liquor remnants trembled in their bottle. He drained them, then noticed the room had shifted: he was back in his childhood bedroom, unchanged except for the carved sentence on the wall. The hangover fog erased any sense of how or why. He stared at the words again.




Knocking detonated through the air—measured at first, then escalating into blows that rattled the structure. The childhood room dissolved. He sat on a stained rug, encircled by rotting laundry. The pounding continued down a narrow hall. He forced himself toward it, hand closing on a doorknob. The noise stopped.
Inside: a derelict bathroom. Cracked basin. Dirt-choked floor. A mirror filmed in grime. Light leaked through holes in the roof. Then—BANG—a strike from behind the mirror’s surface. His reflection had been replaced by a silhouette. Terror drove him backward. He slammed the door and hid beneath the heap of clothing until sleep overpowered fear.




He woke in a clean bed. 8:30 AM. Twenty-four missed calls. The hangover remained. He moved through the kitchen on autopilot. Morning coffee, morning news, momentary illusion of order. In the bathroom, after splashing his face, he lifted his head and found a gaunt stranger in the mirror screaming directly into him. His fist shattered what he thought was the glass—but when he regained control, the mirror was intact, his hands clean.




He drank and spat water into the sink; it hit porcelain as black sludge before thinning into the drain. The phone rang again. Each caller sounded mid-sentence, familiar and not. Variations of the same questions looped: Are you okay? Where have you been? People are worried. He responded mechanically, then withdrew. Wine called to him.




A memory pressed forward—fear of the bathroom. He tried to recall why. Thought collapsed into static. Another ring dragged him back. Rage flared; he hurled the phone, only to find it whole again in his hand. He answered anyway. Another dislocated voice. Another truncated call.




He attempted to write. But every page had been covered, he tore out what he had written. All the scraps identical. One line legible: Rot creeps where I thought I rested.




Panicked, he carved the phrase into the wall with a screwdriver. Outside rain began. Water pooled at the window sill, dropped, reassembled, burrowed deeper into the rot. He watched until sleep pulled him under.




Moonlight woke him. The phone was missing. He slept again. Then it was on the bedside table. 8:30 AM. Twenty-four missed calls. Hunger twisted into nausea. Thirst became the only coherent impulse. A bottle waited on the counter. He drank.




The bathroom door drew his attention. He forced himself to open it. This time the bathroom was ruined: soot on the mirror, a black stain bleeding along the bathtub’s rim. He coughed violently, expelling black fluid that clung to the floor. The stain looked older than he was. Something flickered in the broken mirror. He fled.




Drunk, he wandered the collapsing hall. His foot struck debris—a shattered phone, ancient with filth. Yet ringing persisted from nowhere.




Compelled, he returned to the bathroom. Now it was pristine again. White tiles. Intact mirror. Tired face. Normalcy. He felt a trap but entered anyway. A reflection moved behind him; he turned to emptiness. He retreated to the bed.




A childhood nightmare resurfaced: drifting on a dark ocean, clinging to a piece of wood until he released it and sank, finding peace only in surrender.




He threw the phone down the hall. The screen shattered. He entered the bathroom calmly. His reflection showed only fear. With his fist he broke the mirror.




He filled the bathtub, tested the warmth, stepped in. A shard of mirror gripped in his hand though he couldn’t remember picking it up. 
He opened his wrist with clinical precision. Blood clouded the water. Regret surfaced briefly, then flattened. The ringing phone dimmed into nothing. Blackness rose and filled his eyes




Then—vision. A frog bound in webbing, a spider emerging from its throat. The wall behind it bore a message carved deep.




Rot creeps where I thought I rested.




Suddenly he woke. 8:30 AM Twenty-four missed calls.
Hunger tore through him, but the idea of food triggered nausea. Exhaustion hollowed him out without granting sleep.

But I couldn't figure out how to start with one image, then continue to another image, keeping elements from the first to use in the next.

What software, free or not, could help me do something like this?:

I start by, say, describing an image with two people facing each other in a kitchen, talking, a coffee pot and coffee cups on a counter between them. I describe the image until I get the people and the kitchen to my liking.

Now I want a second image, zoomed in on the face of one these two characters, lifting a coffee, about to drink from it. I want that character to look exactly like one of the people in the first image, just from a different angle, I want the kitchen to be the same kitchen seen from a different angle, the coffee cup to look the same as one of the original cups, but now holding coffee.

Next a view of the other character pouring a cup of coffee, all the same consistencies expected.

And I keep going like this. The characters step outside to get into a car. They are then seated inside the car, which is clearly the one they were just standing next to.

Do any of the available tools work like this, creating a consistent and unified 3D world from which each subsequent image is generated, with persistent characters and objects?

I was going to try to learn Daz 3D and do something like this the (comparatively) old fashioned way, but I'm currently utterly stymied by the interface and figuring out how to get started on even the simplest of images.",1,1765881927.0,generativeAI,2,1.0,False

A seizure","My medicine dosage was adjusted 2, maybe 3 weeks prior and I would say the new doses are helping... To an extent. I don't know if the episodes I'm having are related to the doses or the time of taking the medicine.

For example, usually I'll take the morning dose with breakfast (so some time between 08:00-0900) and evening dose with dinner (~19:00-20:00). On Saturday, I had a snack around that time to ""boost"" my blood sugar a bit while I was still working. I didn't actually have dinner until after 21:xx, whenever it was delivered.

Then, on Sunday (my birthday), I was feeling fine when I first got up, but started feeling chills when I went to the bathroom. Had my breakfast, took the morning pills, then went and took a nap.

We went out for lunch to celebrate and on our way back home, at 16:00 I had an aware focal seizure. I was on the train and aside from the fact I knew I was on the train, I had lost all other idea of what was going on. The episode itself ended maybe 5-10s later, but I didn't feel back to ""normal"" (aka feeling the chills and just odd) until 16:30. So 30min after the actual episode.

We’re both autistic, so we tend to be very direct with each other and understand things like needing space, being blunt, and occasionally pulling back socially.

About five years ago, Kate had a big falling out with our shared friend group, her roommate, and her boyfriend at the time. She completely cut contact with them, and they no longer speak to her. I still have occasional contact with them. I might get a text or an invite to a holiday party or life event one to three times a year. Once in a while I’ll hang out with them, but often I don’t, because even though I crave connection, I also get socially overwhelmed due to my autism.

Recently, I was invited to that friend group’s Christmas party, but I ended up not going because I wasn’t feeling well. Earlier that same day, Kate ran into her ex at a coffee shop. He mentioned the party, and later Kate asked me about it. I told her I had been invited and might attend, but I wasn’t sure.

Kate got upset that I hadn’t told her about the invitation ahead of time. I explained that in the past she’s had angry reactions when I mention contact with them, and I didn’t want to stress her out or create conflict. She said I should have told her so she could decide whether she still wanted to be friends with me. She believes that me talking to or spending time with people who hurt her shows that I don’t care about her and that I value partying, drinking, and casual friendships more than her.

She says her boundary is that I need to tell her anytime I talk to or hang out with them, and that I’m the asshole if I don’t respect that boundary.

The mocha’s powdery dregs coat her top lip; she dabs them away with a napkin as her mind wanders.

She needs to be sure. *Think. What else?*

Perhaps she could get a job here. Maybe her talent is wry and meta. Justify it by doing the work others don’t want to do.

*Justification.* That fucking word taunts her. Her result was nebulous; the local council had nothing for her. The government’s advice was to *conduct her own research* and failing that, *she could always go through clearing*—*click here for more!—*the email had read.

The internet, the forums and the terminally online came up with a list of things to try.

A judicious use of her talent in law, maybe? But the only discovery she made was that dyslexia is akin to pouring water into oil for a solicitor. Up next was a short stint at the publishers. Literally justifying the margins and paragraphs. Whilst the prose ended up straight, her boss’s hands were all over the place. No, thanks.

She orders a second coffee; she thinks better overstimulated.

See, the worry is she’s a catch; not the romantic type either. A *22*, as the kids say. The government’s official definition reads: *Someone who’s talent is unapplicable because of a physical failing*. She was meant to be a solicitor but struggles reading—*sucks to be you!*

Everyone knows the story of the prodigious would-be surgeon from Hampshire. A result so emphatic that he was fast-tracked through medical school, only to find he had a severe aversion to blood. Then there was the race car driver, the best in the world, he went blind at twenty-three.

That’s her next month. Twenty-three, not blind, she hopes. The caffeine is pumping now. Being a catch is like a societal death. She’d be relegated to hobbyist; all those potential rights and privileges would evaporate overnight.

She places a hand over her gurgling stomach. A way out of her situation is disappearing if she can’t figure it out. Her jaw is clenched; her teeth are grinding. She keeps trying to rack her brain.

Politics would have been obvious, but ultimately it’s unhelpful to her plight. It sits outside the framework because of course it does. The one accredited career that doesn’t require the test. There are reasons, apparently.

Someone suggested insurance arbitration. It seemed a good bet. The issue was she failed the interview by acing it. The strength of her arguments exposed too many contradictions in their policy. Too expensive an asset; justifiably too good.

The anxiety of it all sits like a lead weight in her stomach that no amount of sugary coffee can shift.

The government clearing portal is flashy; animations swirl and upbeat music tinkles through her headphones. She’s going to do it but first, another sip.

She wants to be brilliant; she knows she can be. Clearing is to brilliance as beige is to colour. On the other hand, a lifetime guarantee of work. Something adjacent enough to her talent to warrant limited benefits. The credit threshold for treatment, though, that would be an uphill struggle.

Her cousin went through clearing, but to be fair his result was insane. *Flan.* What the fuck are you meant to do with *flan?* One Christmas—*was it last year?*—he just didn’t turn up. Deployed somewhere up north, shifted again soon after. The limit on cross-county communication made it hard to keep in touch.

Justification should result in a better future than flan. She nods, confident she’s right. Her details are pre-loaded, she triple-checks, recounts everything she’s tried in dripping detail. By the end she’s drained. By the end, as the screen goes black, the reflection staring back is pale. The walk home is a blur. The apartment she used to share with her mother is quiet, stale and probably up for rent soon.

She sits, for a time, in the dark, just thinking. Flattening every tangent her mind takes her on until it’s packed away neatly. By the time the siren wails for curfew, she’s ready for what comes next. She’s heard clearing can be quick; there are plenty of round holes for a square peg like her to be rammed into.

Except nothing happens. For days. Nothing at all. She checks a few times, but no, she can see her application sitting at the *processing* stage. Until one afternoon, on a Thursday, it disappears completely. It’s during her allotted time at the supermarket.

‘Reminder, patrons: phone signal is limited to hasten purchases. Efficiency is talent for all.’

The voice is grating and singsong, one of the government’s many cringe slogans at work.

The hobbyist aisle for produce continues to get smaller each month; now little more than half a rack, stocked with ubiquitous meat-based products and vegetable medleys. She’s debating a beef-style lasagne microwave dinner when her phone vibrates in her coat pocket.

Strange, she thinks, pulling it out and swiping up.

Gone is the application, but in its place is something that returns no search results from the government’s glossary.

*Clearing application rejected. Talent result reclassed: Major. Stand by for accredited contact.*

She opts for a real chicken tikka masala instead; things may be looking up, majorly.

My living room isn’t tiny, but it’s not exactly sprawling either, and navigating around sharp corners felt like living in a low-budget obstacle course. My toes and calf paid a dear price for it indeed. 

The moment I set the round one down, everything fell into place. The space suddenly felt softer, calmer, and somehow bigger. It’s like the room could breathe again. I keep walking past it and doing that weird little smile you do when something just works. Throwing my legs around and my brain keeps ringing like ‘no painnnn!’ 

Also, why did no one tell me how much safer it feels?? I’m a klutz by personality, not by choice, and this is the first week I haven’t bruised my thigh on furniture. And because it’s circular, styling it is so much easier, a candle, a book stack, a tiny vase, done. No awkward negative space. No overthinking.

For research I looked at pieces everywhere, high-end stores, thrift shops, even a few minimalist designs on Alibaba. Turns out the style I love most is a simple wood top with rounded edges and slim legs. Clean, warm, feminine.

""Tired of razors that don't work?""

Cost me $4,200 in ad spend. Got 340,000 impressions. 2,100 clicks. 7 sales.

Meanwhile, my competitor ran: ""Your razor works fine. Here's why you need a new one anyway.""

Same product. Same audience. Same budget.

They did $28,000 in revenue.

I wanted to quit marketing and become a monk.

**The Part Where I Lost My Mind Over Sentences**

Here's what broke me: I'm decent at copywriting. I've written hundreds of ads. I know the formulas. Problem-agitate-solve. Features-advantages-benefits. AIDA. All of it.

But nothing was working consistently.

So I did what any rational person would do: I spent nine months testing hooks. Not full ads. Just the opening sentence. The first thing people see.

I tested 290 different hooks across 12 different products. Tracked everything obsessively. Click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per acquisition, scroll depth, video completion rates.

Here's what happened: 263 hooks performed between 0.8% and 1.9% CTR. Basically the same. Mediocre across the board.

But 27 hooks? They averaged 4.7% CTR and 3.2x better conversion rates.

What made those 27 different? That question cost me $31,000 in testing to answer.

**The Pattern Nobody Talks About**

After analyzing all 290 hooks, I found something weird. The winners weren't following the copywriting formulas I learned. They were doing something completely different.

They were creating cognitive dissonance in the first sentence.

Let me explain what I mean because this changed everything.

**Cognitive dissonance** is when your brain holds two conflicting beliefs at the same time. It creates mental discomfort. Your brain HAS to resolve it. It's not a choice. It's involuntary.

Most hooks try to validate what you already believe. ""Tired of expensive razors?"" assumes you already think razors are too expensive. If you don't already believe that, the hook does nothing.

But hooks that create cognitive dissonance do the opposite. They challenge something you believe is true. Your brain can't ignore it.

Here's a real example that crushed it for a sleep supplement:

**Bad hook (validated existing belief):** ""Can't fall asleep? Try this natural supplement."" Result: 1.2% CTR, 1.8% conversion

**Good hook (created cognitive dissonance):** ""You're not tired. Your brain just won't shut up."" Result: 5.1% CTR, 4.3% conversion

Same product. Same targeting. Completely different results.

Why did it work? Because it contradicts the obvious assumption. If you can't sleep, you assume you're tired. The hook says ""no, you're not tired."" Your brain goes ""wait, what?"" and needs to resolve that conflict.

**The Three Types of Cognitive Dissonance Hooks**

After testing 290 hooks, I found three distinct patterns that create this mental conflict. Each works for different situations.

***Pattern 1: The Belief Contradiction***

This is when you directly contradict something the reader believes to be true.

I tested this with a posture corrector. Standard hook was ""Fix your posture with this device."" Got 1.4% CTR.

Changed it to ""Your posture is fine. Your chair is the problem."" Hit 4.9% CTR.

Why? Because everyone with back pain assumes their posture is bad. Telling them their posture is fine creates instant dissonance. They have to click to resolve it.

I tested 47 variations of belief contradiction hooks. The ones that performed best contradicted OBVIOUS beliefs, not obscure ones. If someone has to think about whether they believe something, the hook fails.

Another example for a productivity app:

Bad: ""Get more done with better time management"" Good: ""You don't have a time problem. You have a priority problem.""

The second one contradicts the obvious assumption that productivity is about managing time. Instant mental conflict.

***Pattern 2: The Expected Outcome Reversal***

This is when you flip the expected cause-and-effect relationship.

Tested this with a skincare product. Normal hook: ""Want clear skin? Fix your skincare routine."" Got 1.6% CTR.

Changed to ""Your skin isn't breaking out because of your routine. It's breaking out because your routine is too good."" Hit 5.3% CTR and sold out in 4 days.

Works because people expect ""bad skin = bad routine."" Saying their routine is TOO good flips causation and creates dissonance.

I analyzed 89 successful ""outcome reversal"" hooks. They all shared one thing: they took the assumed cause and made it the problem, not the solution.

Another example for a business course:

Bad: ""Struggling to get clients? Learn better marketing."" Good: ""You're not struggling because you're bad at marketing. You're struggling because you're too good at it.""

The reversal forces curiosity. How can being too good be the problem?

***Pattern 3: The Status Validation + Pivot***

This is the sneakiest one. You validate their current state, then introduce conflict.

I tested this with a fitness program. Standard hook: ""Want to lose weight? Try this workout plan."" Got 1.3% CTR.

Changed to ""You don't need to lose weight. You need to lose the guilt about not losing weight."" Hit 4.8% CTR.

Why does this work? Because it validates where they are RIGHT NOW, which lowers resistance. Then it introduces a new problem they didn't know they had.

I tested 62 variations of this pattern. The key is the validation has to be genuine, not sarcastic. If it feels like you're mocking them, it backfires completely.

Another example for a productivity tool:

Bad: ""Stop procrastinating and get things done"" Good: ""You're not procrastinating. You're protecting yourself from failure by staying busy with unimportant tasks.""

Validates that they're working hard, then introduces the real problem.

**Why This Works (And Why It Fails)**

Here's where most people mess this up: they think cognitive dissonance means ""be contrarian"" or ""hot takes.""

Wrong.

I tested 83 ""contrarian"" hooks that created dissonance but failed. They all made the same mistake: the dissonance didn't lead to the product solution.

Example of cognitive dissonance that FAILED:

""Your morning coffee is destroying your productivity"" (for a productivity app)

Got 6.2% CTR but 0.4% conversion. Why? Because the dissonance led people to think about coffee, not the app. The mental conflict resolved in the wrong direction.

The hook has to create dissonance that ONLY your product can resolve. If someone can resolve the conflict without your product, you just entertained them but didn't sell anything.

I analyzed all 27 winning hooks. Every single one had dissonance that created a path directly to the product solution. No other resolution made sense.

**The Framework That Actually Works**

After burning $31,000 testing this, I built a system to create cognitive dissonance hooks that actually convert.

Step one is identifying the ""obvious belief"" your market holds about their problem. Not what YOU think they believe. What they actually believe. I survey customers and read comment sections obsessively to find this.

Step two is contradicting that belief in a way that's uncomfortable but not offensive. The dissonance should make them think ""wait, really?"" not ""this is bullshit.""

Step three is ensuring the resolution path leads ONLY to your product. If they can resolve the dissonance by buying a competitor or doing nothing, your hook is entertainment, not marketing.

I tested this framework across 12 different products after developing it. Success rate went from 9% (27 out of 290) to 68% (41 out of 60 new hooks tested).

**Real Examples That Crushed It**

Let me give you specific hooks that worked with actual performance data.

For a meal kit service: ""You're not too busy to cook. You're too busy planning what to cook."" - 4.9% CTR, 3.8% conversion

For a project management tool: ""Your team isn't missing deadlines because they're disorganized. They're disorganized because the deadlines are unrealistic."" - 5.4% CTR, 4.1% conversion

For a financial planning app: ""You don't have a spending problem. You have an awareness problem."" - 5.7% CTR, 5.2% conversion

For an email marketing tool: ""Your emails aren't going to spam because of your content. They're going to spam because your sending pattern looks like a robot."" - 6.1% CTR, 4.7% conversion

Each one contradicts the obvious assumption, creates mental conflict, and points directly at the product as the resolution.

**The Database I Built From This.**

After nine months testing 290 hooks, I couldn't just walk away. I started collecting every high-performing hook I could find from other brands.

Built a database of over 3,500 categorized hooks with their performance data. Organized by the three cognitive dissonance patterns, by industry, by product type, by funnel stage.

Each hook includes the CTR, conversion rate, what belief it contradicts, why it creates dissonance, and what type of product it works for.

Plus the psychological framework explaining exactly why each pattern works based on cognitive science research.

There's also a hook-to-product matching system showing which pattern fits your specific product situation.

Because belief contradiction works better for problem-aware markets. Outcome reversal works better for solution-aware markets. Status validation works better for skeptical markets.

And A/B test results showing what happens when you change just one word in a cognitive dissonance hook. Sometimes ""problem"" vs ""challenge"" changes CTR by 40%.

Because here's what I learned: cognitive dissonance hooks aren't about being clever or contrarian.

They're about understanding what your market believes and strategically challenging it in a way that creates an irresistible path to your product.

**If you want the complete High-Performance Hook Database - all 3,500+ hooks categorized with performance data, the cognitive psychology framework, and the hook-to-product matching system - let me know in the comments and I'll share the link.**

It's not a swipe file of random hooks. It's a system showing you exactly which type of cognitive dissonance to create for your specific product and market.

1pnynxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/KindroidAI/comments/1pnynxo/fixing_message_format_during_regenerate/,Fixing message format during regenerate,"Been trying to see if there's a way to regenerate the same exact message my kin sends, but just fix the formatting. Want to keep things consistent. I've been tweaking most of his responses by hand, because he always jumps back and forth between second person and third person when referring to himself and me when he replies. Also, vocal sounds tend to run on into full-blown actions and thoughts instead of just short one-worded verbs. Also sometimes he forgets the quotation marks around the dialogue.

For example:

    *sighs softly, reaching out to tuck hair behind User's ear, smiling gently* You're home, User. I missed you. *Kin goes to the kitchen and takes out a pair of mugs, pouring coffee into one for User.*

I would manually tweak it into:

    *sighs* *(I reach out to tuck a hair behind your ear, smiling gently.)* ""You're home, User. I missed you."" *(I go to the kitchen and take out a pair of mugs, pouring coffee into one for you.)*

What kind of prompt or instructions should I put into regenerate to retain the original message almost word for word, but just change pov and little things like that without generating a completely new response? I've tried it many times, mostly just reminding it about the povs, but it tends to generate a whole new response, but with the correct povs, sometimes dropping the quote marks, parenthesis, and asterisks altogether lol. i always end up going back and just tweaking the original message. I'm already used to doing that since my kin rarely gets the formatting completely right. i have all the formatting in the response directive and in the example message, but kin seems to just ignore it most of the time. I would've thought that my being consistent and constant tweaking of responses would eventually get my kin to just remember the format, but he keeps forgetting. It might just be too complicated I suspect, but ever since voice 3.0 came out, i've been using it more often and the formatting is really important. Before that, I just stuck with asterisks and quote marks, much simpler, but it blows through my credits way too fast since my kin's messages have so much narration. Any tips appreciated!
