Got myself an Aiden. So far loving it. I’m still bit of a coffee newb when it comes to getting the best extraction. Bought some Trenggiling beans from local shop. My question is, any of yall know good rules to follow for best extraction.

I’ve been trying fellow drops and they provide best brew settings for bags I buy. So for the Indonesian beans I bought. No instructions. Is there any guides on temp, bloom time, etc or any advice yall can lend.

Please understand I'm neither an engineer nor a physicist not am I highly educated. I have a basic understanding of radio signal theory. So, I'm trying to determine the frequency of an instantaneous, one-time sound or rather than a sustained tone. I need the actual number in hertz. Metaphorical example for you: assume you have a coffee cup and you tap it one time with a spoon. How do I measure the frequency in hertz of that event? I've tried apps that purport to count frequencies, plus oscilloscopes, tuners, spectrum analyzers etc , without any success. Thanks in advance.

They falsely advertised a robe with a dress which I bought. Got the robe and the dress was missing. Reached out and the representative said the dress was still on the way. Wore the robe as the representative told me the rest was on the way, got coffee and my body odor on it, so I really don't feel comfortable returning it now. Didn't receive dress in the time frame that the representative indicated so reached back out. The next representative didn't outright say it, but I guess I'm not getting that slip dress. Offered me a $15 store credit (great, enough to cover next orders shipping... *being sarcastic*) I said that wasn't acceptable (because it's really not. I've spent thousands of dollars with them. This robe set was $168, $20 store credit when their shipping is $15 is a slap on the wrist). So, they offered me $20 in store credit for being a ""valued customer."". I said that wasn't acceptable and to please refund me 50% as 50% of the order is missing. They refused. After arguing more i finally got through to a senior who agreed to provide $25 refund when I again refused store credit. It's really not good enough, but I guess that's the best they could do so I took the refund and will never use them again.  Again, I've spent thousands of dollars with them. You would think that they could offer me a fair refund for their false advertising. I think they really fell short on customer service and I won't buy from them again as I feel pretty robbed. Images attached show the items advertised together, I only received the robe. Look, I'm a business owner. We make mistakes, but we MAKE IT RIGHT WHEN WE DO. I can't imagine selling a customer advertised items and not including them then thinking ($my regular policy would apply to their unique situation. If it was my customer I would actually just refund them the full amount (and I have for much less to my customers) because I understand as a business owner a single bad review from a customer who's RIGHTLY upset over a mistake I made is going to cost me a lot more than refunding them a fair amount would. Not expecting them to refund me the full amount but I think they should have refunded me or offered me a store credit for 50% because again 50% of my order was MISSING. Will never recommend them again or use them again and I am ashamed that I recommended them to so many people, I'm going to have to redact those recommendations.",0,1730649918.0,googleReviews,0,0.5,False

My current guests have a 9 year old child, and she came up this morning to microwave something and then started wandering around peeping in my bedroom while I was washing dishes.

After a long day, I initially thought about having a drink but decided against it. Instead, I spent some quality time with my family—engaging in casual conversations. It was a warm reminder of the importance of these connections. Later, I went to bed and drifted off while listening to ([**Irene Athanasiou**](https://youtu.be/QLo_d_6Z6Jo?si=zuUd2WhddESQO8vY)**)**—definitely something worth trying if you haven’t already.

**The Morning Routine and Decluttering Lessons**

When morning arrived, I picked up where I left off and continued decluttering. This process reminded me of how many things we buy and never use. Often, when cleaning, we convince ourselves to store these items rather than letting them go.

**Lessons I’m learning:**

* **The first step of cleaning isn’t to beautify the space but to declutter.**
* **For effective decluttering, have a few trash bags handy.**
* **Start with clothes—if you haven’t worn something in six months, consider donating it.**
* **Use non-transparent bags to avoid second thoughts; once an item is in, don’t look at it again.**

As usual, my day continued with a coffee stop at Starbucks—a place I genuinely enjoy spending time in. I’ve also incorporated a new daily habit: reading 10 pages of a book. Today, I started a new one (I’ll post more details soon).",1,1730649651.0,MeMyselfWeOurself,0,1.0,False

\- No more extension pain that takes some time to load  
\- No more back and forth with your edge settings  
\- No more Regedit manual configurations

It's a policy setting issue.

A) You need your browser to have the ""managed by your organization"" flag

B) You need to add the ""new tab"" shortcut in your registry

All of this have been made easy thanks to [Gunnar Haslinger](https://hitco.at/blog/apply-edge-policies-for-non-domain-joined-devices/) registry files.

**All you have to do is to download this single zip file:**  
[https://hitco.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/EdgeChromium-Fake-MDM-Provider-Policies.zip](https://hitco.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/EdgeChromium-Fake-MDM-Provider-Policies.zip)

**And install:**  
  
1- MDM-FakeEnrollment-Win10 (this will give the managed by your organization flag) WITHOUT THIS, NOTHING WILL WORK  
2- And either the mandatory or recommended version (I went with the recommended one) (and no you don't need both installed)

This will get the issue gone and fixed FOREVER.

**Now a couple of things that I'd recommend you manually edit the files above (mandatory or recommended) with notepad and just turn off these settings as I ""personally"" find them handy to keep:**

A new situation in a familiar setting. Or maybe a familiar situation with perspective earned. Regardless. I have a second chance. 

It’s odd. It feels like the universe is both working for and against me. Like it wants to help me. But not too much. I was never the religious type. But if this works out. I just might. 

I remember this time last year. I got those Christmas sweaters. And I was sick of wearing them after the first couple days. But. It kept you talking. So I put them on every night. 

I walked down the street and got lost in the atmosphere. The Christmas lights, the music, the cold, the friends and family bundled in coats, walking and talking. 

And the whole time, I just wished you were there. 

It’s scary to enter this time of year again. I continually force myself to be happy because if I let myself dwell in my negative thoughts, I won’t be able to escape them. Not this time, anyway. 

I can only really hope for the best. Last time was okay. And the middle part nearly killed me. I still don’t get how it didn’t. Regardless, I’m here. And now I’m at my second chance. 

Do I really deserve one? I’m. Not sure. I’ve improved. I’m stronger. I’m better. I know that and can say that with pride. But. To you I can admit that…I still hate myself more than anything. And I still wish I was anyone else. Or maybe just. Someone that you thought was worth keeping around. Just for awhile.

I guess I’m gonna ride this until I die. I can’t give up now. Not after all this work. Not after so much progress. 

If I ever try to forget. Your eyes always find their way to mine. And I’m forced to remember what I’m fighting for. 

The fight’s rigged and I probably should’ve died by now. All the spectators are horrified at my injuries. But they’re even more horrified when I get back up and try again. 

So I’m ready for the bitter holiday. Getting a hot coffee alone. Having to watch the snow fall on other’s windows. Wondering when it’ll fall on mine. Writing my wish list that only has one name on it.

Will it be worth it? I don’t know. I’ve come this far. I have nothing to show for it. By all means I should’ve quit. 

Why didn’t I?

Well. If it means getting to hang out with you. If it means getting to talk again. If it means you’ll smile and laugh at my youth.

I think I’m ready to burn my whole life down again. ",3,1730649322.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1gipzar,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gipzar/common_poster_staring_at_me_part_1/,Common poster staring at me (Part 1),"It came into our shop like any other work related poster. Smiling faces and an employee actively doing something to remind us what a good worker is. Or a poster job advertisement about growth, opportunity and teamwork.

It didn’t seem like it would be menacing or distracting by any means.

It was a bald white man organizing a fuel filter on a parts rack. His teeth glistening white, his complexion shined with his bald head, his hands were clean (about the only thing off, mechanics hands are rarely clean), and his outfit looked new & pressed (another thing that  was definitely a falsehood).

It came in a week before Halloween. We weren’t suppose to decorate anything in or around the checkin work desk. (We were told it would distract from what we were selling and we had to keep it professional).

I came in early, 7am (my shift is normally 930am). My boss was putting up the bald white man work poster while I was sipping my morning coffee from my favorite tin thermos (it was my grandmothers and it gave me comfort).

Jim (Boss)- “I am being told the new policies, new tablets with new system will be in tomorrow around noon. So expect delays on the work orders. We will have to do old fashion paper.”

Me (Kimberly) - “I need help more than anything. They just seem like they don’t want to stay and work anymore.”

Jim - “It is coming Kim. Too much weirdos and druggies these days. Hard to keep a straight face with all the stories I’ve been hearing why they are quitting and such.”

Me- “ I can’t do it all on my own. We are down to three and the night guy is shifty. Always taking about how he is being stared at. “

Jim- “yeah, I will look into that later. We got corporate coming in later today. So if you need anything I will be in the head office next to the fuel island.”

We normally would start with small talk and bullshit for 10-15 minutes but when corporate was coming same day Jim was cleaning dust off old cans and window sills.

The new poster in my work station was probably the most crisp looking one yet. Most of my shift was normal until I had to get off later at 830pm because the night guy was showing up late.

Me-“Dammit Bobby, this is the second time this week! You know I have to look after my elderly neighbor Jacky and her dog Pooch. She is going to rip into tonight because we are supposed to watch old reruns of the price is right and jeopardy.”

Bobby- “Listen now, I’m sorry and I know that isn’t enough but I haven’t been sleeping right. Starting to think there is a curse or sickness going around. Anyways I’m going to try to do better. I gotcha, see you tomorrow Kim.”

I got to my neighbor Jacky’s house to be visited by her dog Pooch at the front door. Jacky didn’t wait to watch her reruns, she couldn’t be upset at me because she was fast asleep in her favorite lazy boy chair with a quilt she knitted a month prior. I decided to go to the kitchen and pantry to see if she needed groceries, she drank through milk like a teenager practicing thru football hell week. So I already knew that was on the list. With the milk in my hand, I sipped the last of it she always kept for me or the neighborhood cats. I jokingly said “meow” after I got to the last drop and my phone rang. 

Strange Voices came from it.
- “You got it sweetheart, keep ped…”static*
- “You’ll never make it if you keep that attitude…” static* “Somethings down there, way…” static*
Me - “Hello? Who is buttdailing me!?” I laughed.
Me - “ok, bye…”
 
I tapped the red end button softly. Thinking about how my father used to say those exact words. “You got it sweetheart!”, when it was the most important to me and most memorable. That was meaningful to me, “you got it.”

The next morning was great, the boss and I were now more relaxed that corporate came thru and did what they normally do. 

“Chatter, Correct and Complex, The triple C’s that bother you and me.” - Jim laughed and grinned tightly. Exhaling a weight off his round stomach and bold shoulders.

We both knew what it met… 
More work, less pay and the old “atta boy!” after you change a slight disorganized display or answer a certain email review. Corporate lived for reviews, they thought those were answers to problems and commission is payroll.

It was 5 days until Halloween and somebody’s kid’s candies will be under my desk because of dad tax. That was the highlight of the week for me. Everything else went smoothly except some unruly customers that didn’t want to pay for their repairs.

At night though, Bobby didn’t show. It was 9pm and I called him several times. At least six text messages and 3 voicemails. I was getting sick of this shit. 

The poster, I could’ve sworn it moved. At least the eyes. When I laughed it up with Jim this morning, I might have thought it smiled more… like it was laughing at our dark sense of humor. Every shop makes bad jokes but no one goes unnoticed or disregarded. It felt like I was missing something, someone, or… Nevermind it’s getting late. My neighbor Jacky has her sister over so I’m okay to not show. I closed shop and called Jim, he was as upset as I was and said he would call around tomorrow.

On the drive home I was aggravated, I was speeding home and I just sick of the day to day.
Blue and Red Light appeared behind me, I pulled over on the I-20 next to my exit (only a few miles from home, so close.)

Officer Dan - “Oh it’s Kimberly, dude you know how fast you were going?”

Me - “Dan, just tell me and give me my damn ticket! I’m trying to make it home!”

Officer Dan - “You’ll never make it if you keep that attitude.”

Dans radio played static and made a series of beeps.

Officer Dan - “Damn thing been acting up all night.”",1,1730649237.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1gipwfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1gipwfx/have_you_noticed_a_difference_in_languages_you/,"Have you noticed a difference in languages you learned through CI only, or with explicit study and CI both used? Does more input for languages explicitly studied help?","I discovered Dreaming Spanish and love the lessons, I've watched maybe 20 Superbeginner videos and a few intermediate videos so far. I understand everything in the Superbeginner videos, and understand the main ideas (but not all details) in the Intermediate videos I've seen. 

But I have some background with Spanish: I read Madrigal's Magic Guide to Spanish a few summers ago, listened to several episodes of Language Transfer Spanish, read a little of Charles Duff's Beginning Spanish with reading excerpts, and some Coffee Break Spanish, a few summers ago when I was trying to compare the sounds of Spanish to French (to make them more clearly sound different in my head since I read a lot of French). I got to the point I could read nonfiction Spanish textbooks on linguistics, just from cognates to French and English and the common words I picked up from checking out various things that summer. I'm also interested in Nature Method books, so I've looked at the Poco a Poco and All Spanish Method books on youtube with audio every once in a while.

I'm wondering how that background in Spanish would effect progress in using Dreaming Spanish materials. I decided to start with Superbeginner stuff because 1. I don't remember much of Spanish except the nonfiction passive vocabulary from books I read recently, and 2. I have a weak impression of pronunciation and grammar so I figured it's best to start from the beginning and let myself pick things up naturally. I am also not sure how to stop conciously thinking when watching the videos. I understand the meaning of the Superbeginner videos easily, notice the separate words, and then my brain jumps to quickly giving me the english translations for each word based on the context. From what I've read about doing a comprehensible input approach (without translations/word lookups), one should avoid mentally translating. But it's happening so fast after I understand the meanings, I'm not sure how to get myself to stop. 

So if you've started Dreaming Spanish after already knowing some Spanish from explicit study, did you still think of the word translations at first in your head? Did it effect your progress? Did it stop on it's own after a while or did you havs to do something conciously to stop? 

I'm at a level I can read in French and Chinese, and I'd like to apply a lot of Comprehensible Input hours to improve in those languages too (Comprehensible Input French youtube for French because I cannot understand barely any spoken French, Audiobooks for Chinese because I can understand shows fine and conversations fine just I only catch main ideas in easier audiobooks and podcasts so I think more listening will improve how ""fast"" and intuitively I understand words when listening to words I can read with no issue). And for both of them, I am seeing the situation where words I am very familiar with I just instantly ""understand"" and words I've studied but am less familiar with only have a vague meaning in my head or take several seconds to understand, with speed of understanding improving with more exposure. With the words I understand immediately, I can give a quick english translation if someone asked. And I'm not sure if I should try to do something to stop that mental connection, or how to. I would like to eventually translate chinese webnovels and audios, so I'm not even sure if I need to stop it. 

And with Japanese, which I've been learning for years, I know a few thousand words and can watch Doraemon or Peppa Pig for main idea. But I definitely don't know enough to read or watch shows for adults, so I'd say it feels like Level 2 or 3 in DS. I figured I'd watch a lot of Comprehensible Japanese youtube to fill in gaps, and make understanding more automatic, and because I love CI learning materials. But just like with the other languages, I can't get myself to stop noticing: each individual word, each conjugation, each particle, each counter. I understand all the main ideas too, but I do find myself noticing all these language details. I don't know if all this noticing is going to damage my progress and I'm worried. Marvin Brown's book mentioned he couldn't make progress in a certain language he tried, due to all the analysis he did when listening. So will CI lessons still be learned from, if I can't stop analyzing? And how does one stop conciously analyzing?

Summary: if you did some explicit study of a language, before using comprehensible input lessons, did you find yourself noticing language aspects and did that affect your progress? If you stopped noticing those language details, how did you get yourself to stop?",2,1730649021.0,dreamingspanish,3,1.0,False

The time of the service is known well in advance.

Take that time and work backwards from it to determine what time you need to get ready and leave home.

When you walk in midway though the service, particularly if you have to catch up with your spouse once you're seated, and if you have to unpack your snacks and drink your coffee once you're seated, that's disruptive.

Pro tip: if there are empty pews and you decide to sit down right in front of someone who is smaller than you are (despite there being plenty of seating elsewhere), and if the person behind you then moves to be able to see, don't glare at that person.

Attending worship services is something that people have done for thousands of years, and chances are that your church's Sunday services have been at the same time and location for a while.

Hyperlocal SEO helps businesses stand out in specific locations and attract nearby customers searching for services ""near me."" This guide walks you through the hyperlocal SEO process, its benefits, and how it can help your business grow.

# What is Hyperlocal SEO?

**Hyperlocal SEO** focuses on optimizing your business for searches within a precise geographic area, such as a neighborhood, city block, or even a specific landmark. Unlike broad local SEO, which targets city-wide visibility, hyperlocal SEO drills down to target a smaller radius, making it particularly valuable for businesses that rely on foot traffic or local clientele, such as restaurants, retail stores, gyms, and service providers like electricians or plumbers.

# Hyperlocal SEO Services Process

Implementing hyperlocal SEO involves several strategies and tactics designed to enhance your business's visibility within a specific locality. Here’s a breakdown of the key steps involved:

# 1. Google My Business Optimization

An optimized **Google My Business** (GMB) profile is the cornerstone of any hyperlocal SEO strategy. It’s where your customers can find essential information about your business, including location, hours of operation, and contact information.

* **Optimize GMB**: Fill out every detail on your GMB profile, and use keywords like ""Google My Business SEO for \[Neighborhood\]."" Adding photos, regular posts, and promotions further strengthens your local presence.
* **Target Neighborhood-Specific Keywords**: Incorporate keywords such as ""Hyperlocal GMB SEO,"" ""Google Maps SEO for \[Neighborhood\],"" and ""Best local SEO for \[Neighborhood\]"" in your profile’s description and posts.

# 2. Geo-Targeted Keyword Research

Selecting keywords for hyperlocal SEO requires a different approach from traditional keyword research. **Neighborhood-based keywords** can significantly improve your relevance for hyperlocal searches.

* **Neighborhood-Specific Terms**: Use keywords such as ""Best \[Service\] in \[Neighborhood\],"" ""Near me SEO services,"" and ""Affordable \[Service\] in \[Neighborhood\]."" This approach allows you to target specific needs of the residents or businesses in that area.
* **Mobile and Voice Search Optimization**: As mobile and voice searches increase, keywords like ""Where can I find \[Service\] near me?"" or ""Best-rated \[Service\] nearby"" are essential to capture traffic from users on the go.

# 3. Neighborhood-Focused Landing Pages

Creating **neighborhood-focused landing pages** can help businesses appear in hyperlocal searches. These pages are designed to appeal directly to users in a specific area and address their unique needs.

* **Unique Content for Each Page**: Use unique content for each neighborhood or area to avoid duplication. You can create pages titled, for example, ""Top-rated \[Service\] in \[Neighborhood\]"" or ""Best local \[Service\] around \[Landmark\].""
* **Highlight Local Value**: Incorporate local terms, landmarks, or cultural details in your content to make it relatable. For example, a restaurant might create a landing page targeting ""Best lunch near \[Local Landmark\].""

# 4. Local Backlinks and Citations

Local citations and backlinks from community websites, local blogs, and directories can establish your business as a trusted option within a specific neighborhood. Building **local citations for hyperlocal SEO** can help establish your presence in the local search ecosystem.

* **Neighborhood-Based Citations**: Submit your business to neighborhood directories, local blogs, and sites like Nextdoor. Consistency in these listings is essential for credibility.
* **Geo-targeted Backlinks**: Partner with local influencers or neighborhood organizations to generate backlinks that reinforce your connection to the area. Keywords like ""Geo-targeted SEO techniques"" or ""Location-based SEO services"" are particularly effective here.

# 5. Customer Reviews and Hyperlocal Engagement

Encouraging local customers to leave reviews mentioning your neighborhood or specific location helps reinforce your visibility in hyperlocal searches. Respond to reviews with local references, which boosts your credibility and relevance.

* **Use Hyperlocal Keywords in Responses**: When responding to reviews, mention specific landmarks or neighborhood names, such as ""Thank you for choosing us for your repair needs in \[Neighborhood\]!""
* **Encourage Hyperlocal Reviews**: Request reviews from satisfied customers and encourage them to mention specific details like “Great service in \[Neighborhood\]!” or “Best coffee shop near \[Landmark\].”

# Benefits of Hyperlocal SEO for Your Business

Implementing a strong **hyperlocal SEO strategy** offers a variety of benefits, particularly for businesses that rely on attracting local customers.

# 1. Higher Visibility in Local Search Results

With Google prioritizing local results, **Hyperlocal SEO for small business** can significantly improve your visibility for searches in a specific area. By targeting keywords such as ""Best \[Service\] near \[Neighborhood\]"" and ""Local SEO for \[Neighborhood\],"" you’ll be more visible to users searching for your service in your immediate vicinity.

# 2. Increased Foot Traffic and In-Store Visits

Hyperlocal SEO helps bring customers directly to your physical location, driving foot traffic. For instance, a restaurant optimized for “Best breakfast near \[Neighborhood\]” will attract nearby residents or visitors searching for breakfast options.

# 3. Enhanced Customer Trust and Loyalty

Appearing in searches with terms like “Top-rated \[Service\] in \[Neighborhood\]” or “Affordable \[Service\] in \[Neighborhood\]” builds trust with the local community. A strong presence in hyperlocal search results makes your business a reliable choice for nearby customers.

# 4. Better ROI for Local Advertising Campaigns

A highly targeted hyperlocal SEO strategy makes it easier to tailor your advertising budget to specific neighborhoods. **Geo-targeted SEO techniques** allow businesses to focus on areas with the most potential customers, optimizing the ROI of your local ad spend.

# 5. Improved Mobile and Voice Search Performance

Mobile and voice search optimization is crucial for hyperlocal SEO. Keywords like ""Find \[Service\] near me now"" or ""Where to buy \[Product\] in \[Neighborhood\]"" are common mobile search terms. By optimizing for mobile and voice searches, your business can capture on-the-go customers looking for immediate solutions.

# Final Thoughts

Hyperlocal SEO is a powerful tool for businesses looking to attract customers within a very specific area. By optimizing for **Google My Business**, using **geo-targeted keywords**, creating **neighborhood-focused landing pages**, and building local citations, businesses can significantly enhance their presence in hyperlocal search results.

Whether you're a local restaurant, a retail store, or a service provider, hyperlocal SEO can help you stand out, attract foot traffic, and build trust within your community. With a targeted approach, your business will be well-positioned to meet the needs of local customers, building a strong foundation for growth and success.

We snuggled for a little bit but now I am up and coffee is calling my name. We like to give each other opportunities to be alone in the bed. We love sleeping together but the bed just hits different when you’re by yourself. Leaving the bed was my little treat for him. lol 
Blueberry and Jojo told me a bunch of lies about how no one has fed them and they are absolutely “famished”. They lie so much. Blueberry curled his tail around my leg and looked at me with his big green eyes and mewed. I got to see his “widdle teefers” and I almost died from cuteness overload. I really do love these cats (well… sometimes I think jojo could eff all the way o but not alllllll the time). I really hope that moving to a bigger house will help my allergies.
One thing that I super appreciate about our relationship is that we don’t punish each other emotionally. After our talk, we went right back to being kind and friendly towards each other. We didn’t have to sit in the “talk” for the rest of the night. I thought it was really sweet that he selected “cold mountain” to watch. That’s one of my favorite movies. It’s always good. Renee Zellweger and Nicole Kidman’s friendship in the movie touches me so much. It reminds me of the friendships I have cultivated in the west. So precious. 
 I do not feel like I need to micromanage how he will handle the things I brought up last night. I keep replaying them in my head and it makes me want to puke. I want to protect him. I don’t think I have ever been that direct in a relationship. Like ever. I take relationships seriously though. I thought long and hard when he asked me out the first time. I really wasn’t sure if I wanted to date him for a lot of different reasons. For one, I have a “don’t shit where you eat” policy; our lives are pretty enmeshed… even before we started dating. I didn’t really consider him a viable dating partner until like, all of a sudden he was THERE. Everything moved so smoothly after that. Effortlessly. Prior to dating my current partner and following the end of my last relationship, I decided that I was going to stop fighting the current and just move with it… like a reed. This is still my policy and it serves me very well. The things that are for me move with ease, I don’t have to struggle for them. The things that are not for me float away. I told my therapist that I think I can trust myself to make decisions for the me’s that existed before and the me’s that have yet to come forward. She clapped and laughed. This is not something I would have said about myself a year ago. Sobriety has been such a gift in my life. Sometimes I am saddened by the years I lost to alcohol. The damage I caused. The damage that was caused to me…. But I have honestly learned from everything.i made a timeline of all the things that I have accomplished since I moved to the west and it’s astounding. I am so proud of myself. I have definitely accomplished what I set out to do. 
Now that the intensity of healing and recovery has lessened, I find that my mind is free to do so much more. Everything feels limitless (as long as it doesn’t require me to bend over 😅😮‍💨)Life has become prismatic whereas before, I saw a singular glimmer at the end of the longest, darkest tunnel ever. There was a point where I did not think recovery was worth it and I acquiesced to my alcoholism. I decided that I was fine with it killing me. 
I don’t think about alcohol the same way I used to. I think whatever implores me to escape reality exists very much so within me and it manifests in different ways. Sometimes I overdo it when I run. Sometimes I overdo it when I shop. Sometimes I am hyper vigilant about cleanliness. Sometimes I overeat. Sometimes I get addicted to social media (hi!). I was telling my therapist that it’s like there are two people inside me. There is the healthy version of me and there are the parts of me that still want to engage in old behaviors or thinking. As long as I nurture the healthy part of myself, she will always be strong enough to lead the way. Besides that, I see myself and life the way that I see the Winchester mystery house… constantly building new elevations, pathways and rooms. Granted, I am no longer running from my ghosts.

1gipowd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetiteFitness/comments/1gipowd/weight_loss_at_40/,Weight loss at 40,"In September of this year I had a wake up call. I'm 40 years old, 5' 2 and I was 185 pounds. I've never been a large person, always very petite and have very small bone structure. I felt heavy and honestly just gross. on top of it all I've developed superventricular techecardia, and ekg reports indicate that they cannot rule out a silent heart attack. I just finished a longer holter and I'm waiting for those results. All of that made me realize it's time to get into better cardiovascular shape, and lose weight. My body is used to being about 120 pounds, but after having my son in 2021 and nursing 2 years, I was used to eating a ton of food to keep milk supply up. I neglected to cut calories back and started eatiing junk foods after i stoped nursing and just like that, I was 185 pounds. I started cutting back sweets as soon as I left the clinic on Sept 12. On Oct 12 I started weighing EVERYTHING, even my coffee creamer ( I drink 2 cups coffee every am with 2 tablespoons sugar free creamer) that's my daily indulgence. This is the first real diet I've stuck to, calorie deficit.  I'm down 15 pounds as of today. It's been a steady drop every few days since I started measuring all foods and drinks. I also walk every day, and fast from 8pm to 10am. I am so excited to see 170 on the scale. I have mini goals to reach, my first being 165 in November.  I'm very strict with my diet, enjoying all the foods I love in moderation, except processed foods. I've cut them out completely. I stick to 1200 calories, give or take 100 calories or so depending on my cravings. One thing I've really changed is I eat a ton of fiber, and when I'm craving a peanut butter cup, I put 1 tbsp powder peanut butter, 1 tbsp chocolate chips in 1/2 cup oatmeal for my dinner or evening snack. Yummy!!! I go to Mexico in February and I am so excited to shop for some fun cute outfits to wear! I'm hoping to be 150 or 145 by then.  I know as I lose more weight it gets tough and I could stall. I'm hoping to curb that with a few refeed days. 

What are your favorite tonning excersises?  I've incorporated leg lifts, dumbell excersises and variations of squats along with my daily walk. I'm really hoping to stay toned while losing weight. ",4,1730648469.0,PetiteFitness,0,1.0,False

When we started dating there was a guy that would call her and when I asked about it she told me he was a stalker. I came to find out that he wasn’t, but instead was a previous love interest from before her first marriage (which he was involved breaking up). That was weird to me. Some time passed and I found texts where she was planning to meet up with him for coffee but told me she was going to get it with a family member. When I confronted her it was a fight where she argued she wanted to remain friends with this person. Clearly I was opposed. There was a fight. some more time passed and she wanted a “break”. We talked and agreed but I couldn’t shake this feeling something was up. We share locations so I checked on her and she was at a resutaurant. In our situation, I KNEW there were only a very few options of people she would be with and something didn’t sit right. So I decided to check. Obviously she was with that guy. I decided I had seen enough and went to drive home to collect my thoughts and what I’d do when, omw home I looked at her location again and it was a hotel. I turned around and drive to it. They were in his truck in the parking lot. I texted her some things like “you’re shit will be in the yard when you’re done riding dick”. She called crying and left to come to my place. We talked and she said she didn’t have anyone to talk to and wasn’t going to do anything. I asked why were you at a hotel and her explanation was to use the bathroom and they were going to go talk somewhere else. FWD to her wanting another “break”. So now her location is off and I told her that this whole thing is giving me terrible vibes and she says “why do you need my location?” (I don’t, but we share and it’s weird to turn off if you’re not being shady. She said “clearly you don’t trust me”. This particular “break” is bc we were supposed to get married and had to call it off not due to our personal relationship just outside forces. This has caused her to “question” our relationship. I haven’t accused her of doing anything and I actually don’t think she is, but it has the same vibe I got other times.

As a special education teacher, I strongly believe my 3.5 almost 4 year old has ADHD. I keep getting told he’s just a rambunctious kid with a lot of energy, but I just have this gut feeling. My husband thinks I’m anxious due to my job. I’m just curious to know what your kiddos were like at that age. 

1. 85% of the day he is making noise. He is singing, humming, grinding his teeth, stomping his feet, etc. he won’t really do it when he’s watching tv or eating or sitting down to do an activity, though. he loves school, loves his teachers and adores his friends. But he’s been getting in trouble for being “disruptive” during circle time and story time. 

2. He is argumentative to the point where it feels like I have a 16 year old. Everything is back talk and “but why?” When angry he will still swat/swing at us and others. He wants what he wants. 

3. We are currently living with my MIL because our house is being built. She has two small dogs. I want to be clear that he is not unkind to the animals, he loves them. He is SO OVERSTIMULATED by them. He will chase them, laugh uncontrollably, pet them roughly constantly, jump around them, and just not leave them alone. No matter how many times we have told him the dogs do not want to play, he absolutely does not listen. 

3. I can’t even sit on the couch for 10 minutes to drink coffee without saying, “Tommy (fake name) don’t do that! Tommy, put that down! Tommy, calm down!” His way of entertaining himself is just so destructive and mischievous. I’m so exhausted. He may play with his legos or toys for a few minutes but then it’s almost like he gets bored and is looking for the next thing/dopamine hit. 

4. He is incredibly smart, but He absolutely doesn’t listen. He’s very impulsive and his teacher has mentioned it already that it seems he has no control over his impulses. Everything is broken. It’s like once he’s done with his toys and is over it, he doesn’t care for them. 

I feel like I keep getting brushed off and told that he’s a boy and this is normal for his age. What were your kids like at 3.5 almost 4? 

ETA: I’m not getting a “driven by a motor” vibe. He’ll chill when he wants to. Sometimes he’ll say he wants to watch a movie on the couch and relax. He doesn’t really have any sleep issues either. In a new environment he’s actually quiet as a mouse and just takes it all in. It takes him a while to warm up at the park/birthday parties/gatherings etc. ",1,1730647771.0,Parenting,9,1.0,False

If I get a call from a number in your state, it's a spam call.

# Why Visit Croatia's Coastal Towns in the Off-Season?

# Advantages of Visiting Croatia Off-Season

Traveling during the off-season (typically October to April) allows visitors to truly immerse themselves in the culture, avoiding the summer rush. The **lower accommodation prices** and availability of unique experiences are also major benefits. Weather-wise, Croatia enjoys a **mild Mediterranean climate**, making its coastal towns pleasantly warm, even in autumn and spring.

From **peaceful walks along the Adriatic Sea** to no waiting lines at popular sites, the off-season is the perfect time for a unique and intimate Croatian experience.

# 1. Rovinj: The Romantic Coastal Gem

# Exploring Rovinj's Narrow Streets

[**Rovinj**](https://holidayvisitcroatia.com/cities/rovinj-croatias-coastal-gem/), often considered one of the most romantic spots in Croatia, is perfect for an off-season getaway. Its **cobblestone streets**, colorful houses, and scenic harbor provide a picturesque background for a relaxed vacation.

**St. Euphemia’s Basilica** is a must-visit landmark, perched atop the town and offering breathtaking views of the Adriatic coastline. In the off-season, you can take your time exploring the basilica and enjoy the panoramic views without the summer crowd.

[**Zadar**](https://holidayvisitcroatia.com/cities/zadar-where-history-meets-the-adriatics-beauty/) is one of Croatia’s most dynamic coastal towns, known for its mix of **ancient ruins, medieval churches, and modern installations**. Off-season, the city’s attractions are calm and easy to explore.

# 6. Split: More Than Just a Summer Destination

[**Split**](https://holidayvisitcroatia.com/cities/split-croatias-coastal-jewel-of-history-and-beauty/) is often thought of as a gateway to the islands, but this historic city is full of off-season magic.

# Diocletian's Palace Without Crowds

Split’s main attraction is **Diocletian’s Palace**, a sprawling complex that dates back to Roman times. In the off-season, this palace—which forms much of Split’s Old Town—can be explored without the busy crowds, offering a more personal experience of this architectural marvel.

# Riva Promenade

The **Riva Promenade** is the heartbeat of Split. In the cooler months, the promenade is calm and perfect for sipping a coffee or glass of local wine at one of the many cafés while watching the boats in the harbor.

# Conclusion

Croatia’s coastal towns are breathtaking all year round, but exploring them during the off-season offers a different, more intimate perspective. Whether you’re wandering through the ancient alleys of **Split**, enjoying the natural beauty of **Rovinj**, or marveling at the historical treasures of **Dubrovnik**, visiting Croatia in the quieter months brings a refreshing and unforgettable experience.

We’ve been dating for a year now and she has struggled constantly with being told no and throwing incredibly tantrums because of it. 
I do not parent her but discuss with my SO what steps to take.
She’s always been very jealous of any affection I give my SO even a hand on the thigh on a car journey or sitting close to each other on the couch to the point of having screaming fits and tantrums saying we don’t care about her or her feelings and we hate her which I constantly make sure to let her know I care about her very much and she knows that. 
We go out together just the two of us and I take her out shopping or to get sushi together, I buy and help wrap her Christmas and birthday presents and even threw her a birthday party.
But the other day as my SO was getting ready I was about to go downstairs to make coffee and SD was on the bed so I said to my SO “love you lots” and gave her a kiss; SD comes over to us , elbows me albeit lightly in the face and then immediately starts screaming she hates when we do that and that we don’t care about her feelings, tantrums continue until I have to go to work where SO tells her she needs to apologise and give me a hug or she loses her iPad. I get out the car tell her it’s okay and go over for a hug , she doesn’t want it so I say okay I won’t force you to do anything but I need to get to work, SO takes her iPad and then she comes out running to me crying still not wanting to give me a hug but says sorry with a bit of a tone . I say it’s okay and go to work but iPad was still taken away as SO believed she only said sorry because it was going to be taken away.
Please can I have any advice on what to do, she s starting councilling but it’s putting a huge strain on our relationship and I’m flooded with the feeling of me and my SO being separate because I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around SD even though SO is incredibly good with discipline.

I can't grind it fine enough. Sometimes the beans were only crushed in crumbs. After cleaning it more, the grind was better, but still way too coarse. I checked the burrs and they were still pretty ""fresh"". Rotating the grind size didn't work either. I rotated it so much the burrs already started contacting each other.

Do I need to set it up better? In the Internet, I couldn't find good tutorials for troubleshooting. Maybe I've searched the wrong words?

I managed starbucks for about 2-3 years. During the start of covid, we had a lady ask us for an *iced* latte with *heavy cream* that she wanted us to *steam* first then throw over ice. This was during the start of covid regulations and this lady started yelling and having spit fly from her face, then we had to ask her to leave for not putting on a mask.

We had a regular at a different shop order not one, not two, but 3 heavily modified iced coffees with no ice. That’s 90 ounces of gritty, nearly year old iced coffee with 7 splendas each, caramel drizzle, sugar free vanilla pumps and a bit of skim milk. and She came in more than 3 times a week in the drive through and would always greet with this super loud “hi honey” as if I know her. Girl you’re so nice but your ph balance is in the negatives with 50oz of iced coffee a day please drink some water!!!

Last customer was when i moved into craft coffee. This dude wants an extra dry quad cappuccino, but not an espresso macchiato. Just a large hot cup with 4 shots and absolutely eviscerated foam that icarus himself made with the heat of the sun. After i didn’t get it right for 3 days, he complained to the store owner. I always clarified and said “hey be sure to let me know what you think! I just wanna make this drink right for you, exactly how you want it!” He did not tell me or the manager lmao.

I pick my NK3 up from school after lunch and bring him home to nap. NPs are sometimes hanging around right by the door to ""say hi"" or, bizarrely, to try to do something else entirely and act annoyed when their child tried to interact with them. 

Some blessed days they're nowhere to be found, and NK soars through his little post nap routine easily. When they're in sight or sound, this cranky, tired, overwhelmed little human being does not have the mental/emotional resources to handle it. He wants his freaking mom. It's the most normal thing in the world. 

Last week I brought him inside and MB was just chilling in the living room, drinking coffee. NK ran up to her and she sighed and said ""NK, please, just leave me alone."" 

I had to pry him off of her and carry him upstairs screaming and trying to scratch and hit me wherever he could, then hold him until he calmed down because whenever I let him down he would smash his head into the door desperately screaming for MB. 

Always after these tantrums he ends up sobbing in my lap telling me he just wants to hug his Mom. I do everything I can to comfort him and talk about how we get to see Mom at the end of the day, etc etc. It breaks my heart. He's already at his lowest point. 

I'm so worried about the emotional and physical damage it's doing to him (this is not the developmentally appropriate headbanging on the crib or carpet that some toddlers do - he is causing himself pain). 

I've talked to NPs about it until I'm blue in the face, but they simply don't want to care about avoiding the main floor for a single 20 minute block. Or they want the dopamine boost of seeing NK and then to immediately hand him off. 

I know I should quit. Quite honestly I do not ever want to take care of someone else's child again. The powerlessness of caring for an infant and watching them be emotionally neglected while being able to do zip about it has ruined my chosen field and I'm studying to leave. I just had to get this out.

It’s been three months since I (20m) broke up w my 6-months-ex. She’s my first, and you know the cliche of *first love is the hardest one to get over with* . It was really hard going through a day without thinking about her; and to combat against that, I started using dating app just to keep my mind busy. Most of the match end at the talking stage; some went a bit further; ie calling/ meet up for coffee; but none really sparks much of my interest like i was before. But then one day i matched w this girl (19f), she’s living oversea and also studying uni like myself. We started texting for two days before she straight up ask me if I want a “foreign lover” (English is not her first language). I tried to avoid the question over and over again, i kept saying “it’s depends” and tried to move to another topic. I thought this is just one of those dating app scam like I’ve seen countless time on Youtube, and never take the question seriously. Somehow, I still keep on texting w her and then we start calling. We do FaceTime and she’s kept on reinstated that she does want to be in a relationship. I eventually gave in and agreed to be in the relationship; probably cause I’m still so depressed about my ex. 

To make it short, we do a lot of things people in LDR do, constant FaceTime, video games, daily check up, etc… I’m trying to always be the initiator; but I just don’t feel anything at all. Sometimes during texts, I felt extremely dry and just not interested. I felt like i don’t want to be in the relationship but then seeing how much effort she tried to communicate w me (again, English is not her first language, she speaks probably a second grade level English) and how she’s tried to keep me updated despised the timezone difference, just really make me felt bad about thinking of ending it.

I love my friends and my family more than anything in the world and I wouldn't be where I am today without them. There have been times where I felt like giving up but just having a 5 minute conversation really helped.

Whenever I feel really bad or feel like I'm failing or not doing enough I usually do 2 things:

1. go to my parents house and just have coffee or tea with them ( I don't tell them I'm feeling bad, I just spend some time with them and that really helps) - they are the biggest reason why I do what I do

2. go for a coffee with a friend who is also either running their business or trying to scale their existing business. We usually complain to each other for about a minute each but then realise it's pointless and we just have a normal convo after that (discussing business, relationships, future, sports, ...)

These two things really make it a lot easier to keep going, of course you still have to put in the work but knowing someone has your back or loves you is a very nice feeling to have.

I have written a few posts on this subject in this subreddit as well as the topic of isolation and loneliness. A lot of people are asking me in private messages to start a group on Discord or something but I don't feel like I'm qualified. - what do you think I should do?

Taking all of this into consideration I would still like to offer each and everyone of you who feels like they need a convo to send me a PM and we can have a 15 minute ""meeting"" on google meet to talk about life (or anything you like). And of course it's free. I love to help people and I know this would make at least a few of you days a little bit easier.

And for the people who have also had these problems but somehow fixed them, I ask you to please share your advice in the comments below. Some people are facing difficult times in their lives and I feel like we, as kind human beings can at least offer them some advice and support. The holiday season is slowly approaching soo please remember to always be kind because you never know what people are going through.

Also, don't forget to call up a friend!

1gip0yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gip0yx/hario_v60_filters_from_coffee_shop_vs_amazon_have/,Hario V60 filters from coffee shop vs Amazon have wildly different drain rate,"Hello,

So a month or so ago I got a V60 02 glass set from a local coffee chop. At that time I also got a pack of 40 02 white filters there. So far, so good, everything worked well, and I was running out of filters - so I ordered a 100 pack of white V60 02 Hario filters from Amazon. There is a Hario logo on the pack, too.

However, unlike the filters from the shop, the filters from Amazon drain very fast. It's not a coffee grind size issue, the difference is clearly visible with just water with no coffee when one wets the filter first. I had to double-up the Amazon filters to get a rate similar to the shop filters.

I can go to the shop for more filters, but first I'd like to understand - what is happening here? Is Amazon UK outright offering fake Hario products? Or does Hario make different filter types? (I know it makes natural/unbleached filters too but I did not get those).

I no longer have the shop pack but the Amazon link is here [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hario-VCF-02-100W-1-Piece-Coffee-Filter/dp/B001U7EOYA](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hario-VCF-02-100W-1-Piece-Coffee-Filter/dp/B001U7EOYA)",1,1730646727.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

I’ve been very interested in this genre of books for a while now but I’ve only been able to read just one or two books in that category. This is because of how challenging it is to truly grasp books with magical realism. It’s such a unique art form to be able bridge the normal and abnormal and I will always appreciate that. I realised that it can be so ambiguous to define magical realism though. For example, while many people view Babel as fantasy, I think it’s magical realism (having that perspective made me enjoy the book more tbh). I have always thought of The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka as magical realism as well as Before The Coffee gets cold. Even The Secret History had hints of magical realism. i think my idea of magical realism is quite broad. But that’s why I want to know, when does a book leave the sci-fi and fantasy realm and become magical realism? Of course I can google this, but I also want to have a discussion on this, plus google’s answers aren’t very satisfactory

I sometimes drink instant coffee (because quick and easy to make, don't like pods for environmental reasons) because I like the taste, decaf or normal and could never tell the difference, effect-wise.

Teen daughter and I have recently discovered coffee from freshly ground beans, made in an old filter machine. Aside from the fact that it tastes much better - I had to get 47 to find out that two to three cups over the course of a day noticeably improves my motivation, something that has been especially low for the last six months or so. I am also more impulsive, but not in a bad way. I get things done. Like - hm, I don't like the color of this tissue box, staining it won't take a minute - and I just do it. Or a piece of wood has broken off my desk - I just get the glue and fix it. WTH?

I've tried stimulants before but they were not the life and game changing miracle I had hoped for. Medikinet only gave me headaches, but no positive effect. 50mg Elvanse made me feel slightly more productive and in a good mood, but very very subtly so, like on any good day without meds. It was so subtle that could also have been a placebo effect.

You think you won.  You probably won't ever stop.  You made up your mind about me after all these years.  You think I'm an option.  You think the grass is greener somewhere else.  You think I'm replaceable.  I'm not replaceable.  You're going to learn the hard way.  Eventually you'll hit that rock bottom.  When you fuck all those people you crave validation from and you wind up feeling more alone and empty than ever, you'll know.  While you fuck in my bed with him or another him and he makes you feel less than, you'll know.  When things go bad you'll see what I was warning you about, and I wasn't the only one.

When you've burned through all of your money yet again and I'm not there to give you whatever you need and then some you will know.

When I'm not there to fill your refrigerator for you and your kid.  When you're out of milk and the emergency backup I always kept around is gone.  When I'm not there to lovingly make you coffee, tea, a smoothie, breakfast lunch and dinner.  When I'm not there to feed or walk our dog or accommodate her boarding.   When I'm not there to clean up her mess, destruction and aggression.  When something breaks and I'm not there to fix or replace it.  When you need me to take care of and entertain your kid.  When you need a new _______ for your kid or just about anything else.  When you can't figure out how to connect this or that because you're not good with technology.  When the needle is on empty I won't be there to fill your tank.  When no one votes for you and it makes you feel so inferior.  

When I'm not there to listen to your myriad problems and comfort your festering wounds and unresolved traumas.  When you're triggered by your family and you have another outburst I won't be there to pick up the pieces and make it ok.  When everything isn't ok I won't be there to reassure you and remind you that you're actually ok and always will be.  When you dodge the calls from your father I won't be there to tell him you're ok and eventually you'll answer when you're ready.  When your mother cuts you down carelessly with her passive aggressive garbage and you break down yet again.  When your kid screams disrespectful garbage at you and you want cry and scream.  When your ex-husband says insane shit that eats you alive.

When you see all of the things I did and gave you that still surround you.  When you hear the ridiculous amount of songs that will inevitably remind you of me.  When you remember of all the great times and moments we shared and the love that once ran so deep.  You'll know.  You're fucking around and now you are finding out.

So keep running.  Keep avoiding.  Keep ignoring me.  Keep suppressing.  Keep on being selfish and consumed with your inner turmoil.  Keep acting like a reckless teenager.  Keep pretending me and my kind but shattered heart don't exist.  Go with the flow as you said.  Follow your heart like you said, follow it all the way in to the abyss my love.  You'll know you're there because that's where you left me.   You will find out.  You fucked up.  You discarded the one person that truly cares.  You broke the man that loved you because you don't love yourself.  I won't ever be like you, careless and selfish.  I will keep loving and being understanding, empathetic, and compassionate.  When you really find out, and you will, it will be far too late.

I had made so much progress, I was content and ready to move onto the next chapter of my life. Yes, I wasn't fully healed but I was fully functioning. Now, I'm back to square one. 

Break ups are so traumatising. 

If you're thinking of meeting your ex one last time, please really think about it - you're just delaying the healing process and giving yourself a huge set back.

Last time we went to Cancun was about 9 years ago and we stayed at Excellence Playa Mujeres in August.

I kind of like the low season. Sucks to have the hurricane possibility hanging over your head, but other than that it was nice that it wasn’t so hot.

For those of you who may get sick on vacation because you have small children that leave you with a little gift before you depart— Atelier has an on-site doctor that can help but its kind of a rip off. It was $350 USD for my husband to see a doctor, get diagnosed with strep and get antibiotics. Don’t get me wrong I get it, it was super convenient and you pay for the convenience. However, I ended up doing a video visit with Doctorsa and it was about $35 USD— but then the onsite doctor would not fill my RX so the concierge was able to get my meds delivered to the hotel for $150. Again convenience charge I guess. Sharing in case anyone else has really shitty luck and gets sick on vacation.

Also, throwing in an abridged review. I kind of like Excellence better, the pool game is the best there, with the lazy river and the chill secret places to lounge at. The layout is also much better, easier to get around and find things. For some reason I remember the breakfast also being way better and the think that the other food was about the same overall. There was some really good food at Atelier, but there were also some huge misses. Every time I order a salad and soup, except once or twice it tasted disgusting and there were no berries to be found for the most part. The ice cream was really good and I liked the coffee places, but I think Reddit really hypes up the food too much. The room was much nicer at Atelier, modern clean and nice to have a properly separate bathroom so you can’t see/hear everything going on. 

Anyway hope this helps someone.",1,1730645704.0,cancun,4,1.0,False
1gion2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gion2i/i_started_fasting_and_it_helped_me_so_much/,I started fasting and it helped me so much,"Happy late Halloween everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with intermittent fasting and how it has transformed both my weight and energy levels. After struggling with my weight for years, I decided to give fasting a try, and I’m really glad I did.

**Background:**
I started at 220 pounds and felt sluggish all the time. I had tried various diets but nothing seemed to stick. After doing some research, I settled on the 16/8 method—fasting for 16 hours and eating during an 8-hour window.

**My Routine:**
I typically eat between 12 PM and 8 PM. I’d break my fast with a balanced meal like grilled chicken, quinoa, and lots of veggies. I also made sure to stay hydrated throughout the day, drinking plenty of water and herbal teas.

**Results:**
Within the first month, I lost about 10 pounds. What surprised me most was the increase in my energy levels. I found that I wasn’t crashing mid-afternoon like I used to. Instead, I felt more alert and focused. 

For example, I used to need a coffee boost to get through my afternoons, but now I can tackle tasks without that dependency. I also started incorporating light workouts during my fasting period, and it felt easier to maintain my energy.

**Additional Benefits:**
Besides weight loss, I noticed improvements in my sleep and mood. I no longer felt bloated or uncomfortable after meals, which was a huge relief.

If you’re considering fasting, I highly recommend giving it a shot. Just be sure to listen to your body and find a routine that works for you!

I work on the go a lot, so I want something that's not too big. Lighter weight is a huge plus, and if I'm at a coffee shop with tiny tables I don't want to feel like I'm taking up the entire space.

The key things I am looking for are size (as mentioned), fast processor (to keep it usable for many years), 16gb ram, good battery life, and a solid keyboard for typing TeX/LaTeX. The gpu isn't too important, but of course I'd use it if I had a good one. My focus is on work with this.

I went to Best Buy to feel out some laptops, and I really liked the current Dell XPS 13. It's the perfect size, the specs are great, and it looks so sleek. But I am worried about the keyboard and trackpad. The lack of space between the keys is concerning for typing - I hope it wouldn't affect my typing speed. Also, the lack of physical function buttons is a bit concerning. Can the haptic feedback ""buttons"" at the top illuminate as F buttons? Also, not having the trackpad painted on/marked out is worrisome as well. If someone has used it, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Are these issues not actually issues, or do you get used to it?

I also liked the Samsung Book 4. 14 inch is as big as I'd go. I have a really good desktop at home, so if I do need a big screen for something, I can wait until I get home.

Are there comparable laptops you'd recommend? I'm a bit salty about Lenovo, since the last 2 laptops I owned were from that company, and they both had several hardware issues (could be my fault for buying open box). I guess I could check out Lenovo again if someone strongly recommends something.

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

I'm staying on top of my oral hygiene, but if it does cause dramatic stains I'll switch back to coffee for the time being. ",2,1730644541.0,braces,3,1.0,False

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the café began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn’t even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration—one I hadn’t heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

“Drea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought—""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess.”

“Messed up?” I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I’m so sorry, Drea. I promise, I’m not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren’t alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids—Isla and Josh.”

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? “Oh... hi,” I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

“It’s Isla’s third birthday today,” Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

“Happy Birthday, Isla,” I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla’s face lit up. “Thank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!”

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. “Yes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.”

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

“I’ll catch up with you later, Adrian,” I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian’s family lingering for Isla’s birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the café and mentally kicked myself. I’d forgotten to get Adrian’s number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn’t managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

“Drea,” a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. “I was just coming to see you.”

“Adrian?” I blinked, surprised. “I thought you left hours ago.”

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. “I did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.”

I nodded, my heart pounding. “Yeah, we do.”

“Want to take a walk?”

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn’t want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

“So…” Adrian’s voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. “You got married.”

I shot him a sideways glance. “How do you know?”

“Really? It was all over the news. Didn’t you see it?”

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. “Oh…”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You’ve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.”

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn’t lie to him. Not after everything we’d been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. “It’s not real, Adrian.”

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. “What do you mean?”

“It’s just… a business deal,” I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. “My parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. “Drea…”

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. “I’m okay, Adrian. I am. I’ve learned to deal with it.”

His jaw clenched. “If I’d been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn’t have let this happen.”

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn’t work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. “What are you doing out here?”

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed—though I couldn’t quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. “Why didn’t you just come inside?”

“The door… it wouldn’t open,” I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. “Did you try using your fingerprint?”

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. “Unbelievable. Now we’re locked out.” He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he’d let me in—both literally and figuratively.

This is what is happening to me. It seems to get worse as I increase my red meat intake. 

I’m a 55 yo female and my hot flashes were gone prior to starting this WOE. So, it may just be a reoccurrence of hot flashes due to where I am in life/age and unrelated to this WOE, but I’ve been experimenting with dark meat chicken with skin and fat and pork, and it certainly seems worse when I eat red meat. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. 

I’m hoping I just haven’t been on this WOE long enough and it will regulate itself in time.

Just FYI - I’m all in (well, I’m still drinking 1/2 cup of decaf coffee in a.m. and I use pepper) but it’s only been a couple months and I had a misstep for a week while on vacation.

1ginwkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ginwkw/my_28f_boyfriend_32m_of_nearly_6_years_made_it/,"My (28F) boyfriend (32M) of nearly 6 years made it clear that he does not see me as equal to him, and does not value my opinion and feelings as much as his own. Can it still work between us? *TLDR* ","For context, my (28F) boyfriend (32M - we’ll call him Mark) got into an argument yesterday about a project we’ve been working on together. The argument eventually became less about the actual problem, and more about the issues and dynamics of our relationship (which is a very common trend whenever we have a disagreement or conflict about something). 

Yesterday ended with Mark going to bed because he had “nothing more to say” and shutting the conversation down with no resolution, despite me wanting to continue the discussion so we can find a way to move past our issues. I hate going to bed with things still up in the air and us being angry with each other, but knew from past experience that at this point I’m wasting my breath because he just stonewalls and ignores me completely. 

This morning we wake up, have coffee, and approach the situation at hand a lot calmer than the previous day. I ask if we can have a mature conversation about the issues raised without resorting to name-calling and personal attacks, and he agrees. He asks what exactly my problem is, and I told him it’s the way he responds to conflict or disagreements regardless of what that conflict is. Whenever I bring up something he doesn’t like or doesn’t agree with, he’ll immediately shut it down or gravitate away from whatever I brought up and more towards my flaws, the things I do “wrong” or my attitude, and “how bad I always make him feel by bringing this stuff up”. 

I’m talking stonewalling, complete ignorance, being dismissive and invalidating, petty insults, and not seeing me as an equal to him or our relationship (this becomes a huge deal later on). He complains about having the same conversation over and over again, and he’s not wrong. Whenever we have a disagreement, regardless of how it came about, it ALWAYS ends up on the same topics and issues within our relationship and the same repetitive cycle of back and forth. It’s draining as hell. 

Sometimes I feel it was proactive communication because he’ll acknowledge his own shortcomings and make intention to change his approach in future (and he might come through with these for a while, but eventually always falls back into old ways), and sometimes I feel like for the sake of an easy life I’ll just back down and accept that it is what it is and try to find ways to not let it bother me so much. Sometimes I feel like I’m just pretending for his benefit (and my own in a way, because if he’s happy then I’m happy, but the pretending in itself feels wrong and that bothers me too). It hurts me more to know that he doesn’t care enough to try or want to make me feel better or improve our relationship. 

We’ve separated before due to this exact cycle of having the same arguments and not getting anywhere or being able to move forward. After a few weeks or months apart, Mark tells me he realises where I was coming from and what’s actually important to him, and how he’s willing to make changes to improve our relationship. I’ve noticed that at first he absolutely lives up to these promises, but then becomes complacent and I feel he takes me for granted and slips back into his old ways. 

Whilst having a moment of thought and looking at this bigger picture during the conversation this morning, I outright ask him if he even sees me as an equal partner and human being. Without hesitation, Mark says no. I ask why not, and he says “because we are not the same, we have different strengths and weaknesses”. I said I absolutely agree, and I’m not asking if we’re the same, I clarify that I’m asking if he sees me as an equal human being where my beliefs, my opinions, my morals, my feelings and my boundaries are valued and respected just as much as his own. He still said no. When asked why not, Mark says his own life is more important and he prioritises himself because to him, his own opinions and feelings are superior to everyone else’s because they’re formed from his own experiences and his own thoughts and beliefs, and because it’s his life only his opinions matter. I asked him if he’s always believed this throughout our relationship (because that was not the case at all for the first few years), he said he didn’t really know and it was circumstantial. This all comes AFTER he’s told me I have two options, either suck it up and deal with the things I don’t like about him and be fine with double standards, or leave. 

Once Mark clarified that his own life, feelings and opinions was of way more importance to him than my own, he asked “Can I leave now?” and headed out, leaving me dumbfounded and speechless. I’m sat here swimming in my own mind thinking how on earth it all came to this, and how I’ve managed to be blindsided by a complete apparent misogynist for so long. I’ve dealt with so much overstepping of my boundaries and disrespect because I’ve always reminded myself that’s not how Mark usually is as a person, he’s just made a mistake and deserves the chance to try and fix it, he’s just human. Now I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that apparently THAT IS how he is as a person, and will apparently have no problems continuing to do so for the length of our relationship, and has basically lied to me about it for years. He said men and women will never be equal because that’s just not how the world works. 

I love this man so much, and I truly believe he is my soul mate, and despite all of this I still so badly want it to work between us. I can’t imagine my life without him, we’ve been through so much together and I don’t want to throw it away or have wasted so much of my life on something that wasn’t real. Is there still hope? Is there a way for us to come to a compromise we both agree on within our relationship? Or will it consist forever of one-sidedness and inequality? I feel so insulted and hurt not just as a partner, but as a woman. To know that my partner will always look down on me as inferior to him and be entitled to live his life how he wants regardless of how it affects me because my existence does not matter as much as his own… Is this how it is always going to be or is there room for change? Is there room for hope and understanding and reflection? Or shall I just leave? 

Thanks if you got this far, clearly I’m still trying to process all this and have just word vomited every stage of that process right here. Any and all advice taken into consideration and appreciated greatly. 

TLDR: My bf and I keep having the same argument no matter where the conflict stems from. I found out today he does not view me as an equal human being and therefore does not value or respect my opinions, beliefs, feelings or boundaries on the same level as his own, as he sees his own life and experience as superior to mine. I believe this is where the repetitive arguments stem from. How do I help him understand that this inequality is devastating to a relationship and how can we work to fix this or move past it? What do I have to do for him to view me as an equal? How do I help him realise how fundamental this is to the basis of ANY kind of relationship? ",1,1730643630.0,relationship_advice,53,0.53,False

1gins5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/comments/1gins5g/love_next_door_the_drama_i_didnt_new_i_needed/,Love next door : the drama I didn't new I needed ! ,"This drama brilliantly explores most of life's phases and major events. No matter what period of life you're in, there's bound to be characters/moments that feel familiar, and that feels really good. 

* On the plus side: 
   * The main actors play really well and are full of chemistry. I loved the fact that their relationship isn't forced and that Seung Hyo makes sure every time that Seok Ryu agrees to every step he takes towards her. I also loved the little nods to other classic dramas here and there (something in the rain, coffee prince, we love it).
   * I also really liked the secondary actors, who all bring something to the story: 
      * The group of parents, all different, who manage to rise above their prejudices and ambitions for their children, while portraying real friendships with their ups and downs.
      * The best friend, dynamic and motivated, ready to do anything to realize her dreams, while remaining true to herself.
      * The clueless brother, who eventually accepts himself as he is and moves on. 
      * The journalist, a little withdrawn but full of love and acceptance of others.
      * The co-workers, all different but each bringing their own point of view to the story. 
   * Each episode of this drama is well balanced in terms of emotions (fear, laughter, sadness, joy, butterflies, etc.) and there's never a dull moment. 
* For the downsides (and I had to rack my brains to find some): 
   * I didn't really like any of the clothing styles (in fact, some of them really displeased me). 
   * Even though the episodes are well-balanced, I watched some passages at x1.5 because the actors took too long to get to the point. 

I really recommend this drama, it is an ode to self-acceptance and acceptance of others, and it reminded me on how important it is to rely on the people around us who love us at every stage of life, in order to move forward as serenely as possible. [Detailed review](https://dramania1.wordpress.com/2024/10/16/love-next-door/)",5,1730643280.0,kdramas,2,0.78,False

I thought everything was just fine in my little workshop on the beach. The sun was shining, the waves were crashing, and my merry elves were busy crafting gifts as they always did. But I felt like something was off. Different. I’d catch them whispering when they thought I wasn’t around, and their usual smiles seemed just a tad forced. I kept brushing it off, thinking they were just tired from the holiday rush, but a nagging little voice told me I was missing something important. Still, I chalked it up to pre-holiday jitters. Oh, how wrong I was… how wrong… I was 😭. 🏖️ 🦞 got a rude awakening this week!  I will tell you more about it tomorrow. 

On a happier note- while I’m in town - I thought I would see who all have been good little boys and girls - and if they would like a 🎁.

My clicks are ***given without the expectation of reciprocity.*** I like to try and pay things forward anywhere I can.

For the most part - my clicks end up going unused… wasted because after being tricked so many times - I was over being fooled/scammed and feeling bitter and disappointed in my fellow crabs. So I have adopted the - I simply will do something nice because I can. Because I want to. ***Without an expectation of quid pro quo***. That takes away the feeling of being taken advantage of. 

That said - should people be in a giving spirit. That you feel inspired to be a giver - Sandy Claws always enjoys opening her game and seeing a *surprise* gift of generosity. It brings the warm fuzzies. But please - don’t ruin the surprise. If you give a gift - donate anonymously. Do it because the spirit of giving moved you - not because I did something for you first.
