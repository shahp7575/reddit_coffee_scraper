I’m wondering if I got an overall good impression. Here’s roughly what I did (I was by myself btw, mid 30s).

\- Day 1: I stayed at a pretty good hotel in Mitte, Aleksanderplatz. Explored Friedrichschain (but just a bit unfortunately, it feels like I missed a lot there). From there I walked all along the Spree, (East Gallery etc) and then walked via Berliner Dom and this long ‘government-building’ street to Brandenburger Tor and galavanted a bit around Tiergarten. 

\- Day 2: Met up with a friend and went to a gym. I joined a social event and met some new people. Then explored most of Kreuzberg. In the evening I went out for dinner and checked out the city views from the Fernsehturm in the evening (which was really cool).

\- Day 3: Another long day of walking (it’s how I prefer to explore new places). This time I walked all around Prenzlauer and all of the streets, squares, markets etc. it has to offer. Then walked all the way to Potsdammerplatz, followed by the Kurhfurstendam area. Went to a comedy show in the evening.

\- Day 4: Exploring the ‘cosier’ parts of Mitte (I really don’t like the whole Alexanderplatz area). Grabbed a train back to the airport around noon.

There were a lot of other things I wanted to do but there simply was no time. I’ve lived in some big cities, but every time I sort of misjudged how massive this city is lol. On some days I was simply exhausted because I averaged 25KM of walking every day. I also took some Ubers and the metro at times of course. In between I had lunch and coffee at some places, or simply sat somewhere to relax etc.

Do you think I got a pretty good idea on the general vibe of Berlin based on this? Or did I mess this one up and missed something?

=====

*\* I deliberately did not want to go clubbing, because I figured it would just give me a temporary high but little understanding of the city’ vibe overall. I’m in my mid 30s, so clubbing isn’t a big thing for me to consider when I’m moving.*

*\* My overall impression was that the city is cool, gritty, chaotic, dirty, and massive. It’s ugly. But it also has beautiful areas. And maybe it’s this sense of never knowing what you’ll find next that makes it so interesting! A friend of mine who is an urban planner told me a good city keeps surprising you. That was definitely the case for me.*

*\* I found people to be very friendly here, but I didn’t socialize that much. Everyone really seems to have their own identity and I think that’s great. I liked P.berg + parts of Kreutzberg. The area around K.dam was also cool. I also wanted to explore Charlottenburg as well but again, I had no time. Same goes for museums, no time. Normally I'd socialize more but that wasn't. necessarily the main reason I came here this time.*

*\* I’m aware that the housing market here is really rough, and there are other considerations when moving to a new place. I’ve lived in different big cities before and I’m at a phase in my life where I still want to live in a big city one more time. At the moment I’m exploring a bit here and there to see how I feel when I’m in a city, and how I experience the general quality of life there.*

**TLDR; I explored the city for a couple days to see if I want to move here, but I’m not sure if I did the right things and actually got a good impression overall.**",3,1763965156.0,berlin,0,1.0,False
1p59nk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1p59nk3/the_coffee_table_theory_i_havent_seen/,The Coffee Table -  theory I haven’t seen,"I know there’s a few theories about what actually happened with the baby and the coffee table. The dad did it on purpose in a fit of rage, he tripped, etc. 

I tried looking around but there’s too many subreddits to search through so maybe it’s been said but does anyone think that it could actually be…the coffee table that did it? Perhaps it’s haunted? lol.

The salesman said that it will give them everything they want, make them happy if they treat it well because “objects need to be treated like loved ones. They need to be loved.” 

From the moment she saw it, the wife laughed and talked shit about the table. But Jesus loved it and claimed how much he wanted it. He also made it clear that he wasn’t ready for the baby. So in return…the table gave him what he wanted, what it thought would make him happy - No baby 😭 

I thought initially the salesman knew about the table being haunted, but then I wondered why would he go try and be Jesus’s friend and potentially be around it.

Maybe I’m reading to much into it and it was just a case of slimey salesman tactic to claim the glass as unbreakable, and as he was awkwardly bringing it up the stairs Jesus created a tiny hairline fracture in it which caused it to break easily. 

I dunno, just an idea. Thoughts?

Floors are one of the biggest investments in any home, and keeping them in great condition adds both beauty and value. Whether you have hardwood, laminate, vinyl, or tile, one of the most common problems homeowners face is scratches caused by furniture. Over time, even small marks can dull your floor’s finish and lead to costly repairs. Thankfully, there are simple and effective ways to protect your floors and keep them looking flawless for years to come.

# Understand How Furniture Causes Scratches

Furniture scratches usually happen when heavy pieces are dragged or moved without proper protection. Chairs, tables, and sofas are the most frequent culprits, especially in high traffic areas like living rooms and dining spaces. Hard chair legs, metal casters, and rough furniture bases can easily wear down a floor’s surface layer, leaving visible marks.

# Use Felt Pads and Floor Protectors

One of the easiest solutions is to use felt pads under furniture legs. These small, soft discs act as a cushion between the furniture and the floor, allowing smooth movement without leaving marks. For heavier pieces, opt for thicker felt pads or furniture glides that provide better protection and stability.

* Replace worn out pads regularly, as dirt and dust can accumulate on them and cause abrasion.  
* For chairs or frequently moved furniture, adhesive felt pads or screw on protectors work best for long term use.

# Add Rugs and Mats

Rugs not only enhance the look of a room but also act as a protective barrier for your floors. Placing rugs under dining tables, sofas, or coffee tables helps prevent scratches and scuffs. For high traffic areas, choose durable rugs with non-slip backing to keep them securely in place.

Entry mats are also useful for preventing dirt and small stones from being dragged indoors, which can otherwise scratch hard flooring surfaces.

# Lift, Don’t Drag

It might sound simple, but lifting furniture instead of dragging it can make a big difference. Even a small drag can create noticeable marks on delicate flooring. When rearranging furniture, use sliders designed for your specific floor type. These handy tools allow you to move heavy items easily without damaging the surface.

# Choose Furniture with Floor Friendly Bases

Some furniture is designed with protective caps or rounded legs that are less likely to cause damage. If possible, opt for chairs and tables with rubber or soft plastic leg caps. For office furniture, look for chairs with rubber or polyurethane casters instead of hard plastic wheels, as they roll more smoothly and reduce friction.

# Regular Maintenance Helps Too

Keeping your floors clean plays a big role in preventing scratches. Dust, sand, and debris act like sandpaper when furniture moves across them. Sweeping or vacuuming regularly keeps the surface smooth and safe. For wooden and vinyl floors, using the right cleaning products helps maintain the finish and keeps the surface resistant to minor abrasions.

# Preventative Practices That Last

* Place protective mats under rolling office chairs.  
* Rearrange furniture occasionally to prevent uneven wear.  
* Inspect furniture legs regularly for rough edges or exposed nails.  
* Apply a fresh coat of floor finish or sealant every few years to strengthen protection.

# Lasting Impression

Protecting your floors from furniture scratches doesn’t require major effort, just a few thoughtful habits and simple tools. Using felt pads, rugs, sliders, and proper cleaning methods can help you maintain a smooth, scratch free surface. With a bit of care, your floors will continue to look as stunning and well kept as the day they were installed.

1p59mgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianMen/comments/1p59mgx/did_i_fumble_my_boyfriend_by_abusing_him/,Did I fumble my boyfriend by abusing him?,"Hi all, I got into a relationship a year ago. I had known that guy for a years. Since I am 27 I made him clear that I am doing it from marriage perspective. Initially we confessed and were unofficial for a month, roaming around all day long, texting etc.
In Month 1, he went out with ""A Friend"" at night and disappeared for 6 hours, next morning when I had some suspicion I asked him he said he had gone out with a female and she asked him for a hookup and he declined, but they are just ""friends"". I fought and then also he didn't cut her off but later he did after she started pinging him for hookups. After this we started dating officially. Month 2: I got to know he has a ""sister/friend "" from Tinder. I told him how can you have a friend from tinder, he told me how they used to chat sexually  (her boyfriend had allowed her to be on Tinder)-she used to send sexual messages to my boyfriend and now they are brother sister.I fought but till date he never left her, constantly in touch. I went to Dehradun with my family and  brothers( my mom's friends sons, and I have known them for 22 years...), and when I say brothers I mean Rakhi brothers. Our parents were there. He told me that I am also alone with two boys in a house... I was with my family, parents, brothers.. this fight happened because while I was in Dehradun, he was out with a mutual friend till 1 am at night.. and he yelled at me when I said what are you doing alone with her? Month 4 of dating, I went out alone with a female batchmate for a coffee,  when I came back home I told him this, he was scandalised.  He later told me that they had slept together in first year and she cheated on her bf with him and confessed to her bf and left him. They both hid it from me. He always knew I was friends with her. MONTH 6, ny family said they need to meet him else they want to start looking for rishtas, I asked him he declined, said he is unsure , had a lot of fight at home for him.  I didn't let them search anyone for me and relation with my family isn't good anymore.
 Month 7 of dating, I found out he was in a Talking Stage with his best friend's ex, she used to text him daily. He denied being in a talking stage and fought with me for her. He called her infront of me and she ended up confessing.

Month 9, he puts random accusation on me, why did you write ttyl instead of brb, why did you say I ""maybe you might protect your sister idk""- because he was okay with me driving alone at might to a wedding venue in haryana  and 10 people I asked said no that you should go with family. He broke up wirh me 7 times for me? "" I am not good enough for you"" and it hurts me everytime and I beg him. I call him 10 times he doesn't answer,  he has texting time defined, won't text before 12:30 pm and then directly after 6 pm. He still has a soft corner for his friend's ex... always defends her.
I feel very hurt because whatever I did was to marry him.
4 days ago when he was twisting my words and flipping the narrative I lost my cool after a year... until now I beg I chase him, I abused him in Hindi many times on calls and texts and told him to go to his girls.
Later I waited outside on the road a little far from his home and begged him to meet. After 50 calls and texts he did but he is offended that I abused him.
I probably shouldn't have but I was being made to accept all his women. That I was wrong and that he is always right. 
He knew my family wanted to meet him. I am a clown. Those girls won.
I lost

I didn't want to date him I wanted to marry him directly 
He left
I am devastated 
I even took therapy in between he knows because I had to accept those women in his life",1,1763965039.0,AskIndianMen,0,1.0,False

Two weeks ago my boss (43m) sent me (27m) an email which I found out later he sent to the rest of the office. He made us aware that the coffee brand the company buys us is no longer being provided. We all got quite enraged as the brand we are given isn't even expensive (around $6 per 100g) we are not a big company with about 15 staff total. We have each tried to make attempts to persuade him against it but he really won't budge.

After a week with a completely coffee less staff thing started to get tense, many pointed out that this simple purchase made the office feel more like a family of sorts that the community accepted was a good touch, but no matter what we said he wouldn't budge on his stance. Me and my roommate (28m) who we will call mathew, decided it was time to be petty.

For some background our boss drinks EXPENSIVE coffee and has never let anyone taste it before. I've found out it's about 110ish dollars for his instant coffee. He constantly raves about his ""perfectly smooth instant coffee” and we all have become sick of it. Me and Mathew went to the supermarket and brought a tub of what we'd normally be provided and waited for my next shift. Our shift starts don't line up so it was all on me to complete what we called the great coffee hist. 

On Monday i came into work 20 minutes before he was scheduled to arrive and snuck into his office and switched the coffee. It was a fresh container. By the looks of it he had only had one drink. I switched the coffee powder between the containers, so he believed that i had brought in my own one from home but really i took his…

Later that morning i went in to conveniently chat to him to see how the coffee was treating him and it turns out HE LOVED IT. He told me that he didn't know what happened, but it got better overnight!! I had to practically run out of there to stop myself from laughing in his face.

I found Matthew to tell him what happened and him and the other colleagues around were dubbed over in laughter. But some kept calling me a asshole?

So yesterday me and my friends planned to grab a quick snack in our university cafeteria, and one of my friends said she can’t come since she has to grab lunch with her boyfriend. To give some context: we are a trio friend group, and the friend in question (let’s call her X) studied with me in the same school before university, so we share a lot of history. We are also in almost all the same classes. The other girl in the trio (S) doesn’t share many classes with us, so basically me and X are together almost all the time in class.

Six months ago, I met with a major accident which left me in a wheelchair temporarily. I still use the wheelchair for longer commutes, but I’m improving with rehab. Despite everything, we three are good friends. X got into her relationship soon after college began, and from the outside it seems very dysfunctional. Her boyfriend is extremely lazy and makes her carry his bag most of the time, but whatever works for them. We don’t discuss relationships because her relationship always caused strain in our friendship. Also, S just had her breakup, and I’m in a long-distance relationship for 4 years.

Now X is very involved with her boyfriend. She started missing classes, almost stays at his home all day until she has to go home, uses our names as excuses (saying she has college even on Sundays), and goes to his home because he calls her to “study together” — but from what I hear he just sits around watching TV while she studies. Her reasoning is that she loves him so much and feels comfortable with him, but what we see is he’s isolating and controlling her. X used to study really well, but after getting into this relationship her grades dropped and she’s barely passing because she spends all her time writing HIS assignments and recording HIS notes. Even before this, whenever we plan on going out, she says that he may call, so she always cancels.

Yesterday, since I can now walk short distances and my birthday is in 5 days, I thought I could treat both of them to thank them for the emotional support during this hard time. I want to emphasise that I did not ask much help from either of them at all — I arranged my own accommodations, I managed almost everything alone, and in the past 6 months I have probably asked them for help like 2–3 days total. Even when I genuinely needed support, I didn’t depend on them much.  
There was even one time when I asked X to have lunch with me because I couldn’t go to our usual lunch places due to being in a wheelchair and I didn’t want to eat completely alone in the classroom. She usually goes to her boyfriend’s home for lunch, but that day she came, sat with me, and then kept complaining loudly to everyone passing by that “it’s so unfortunate” that she has to sit there and have lunch with me. Mind you, it wasn’t even an isolated place — it was right outside my classroom, and three other classmates (with whom I don’t even talk) were already having their lunch there, so she wasn’t even alone with me. I felt so small and embarrassed.

So when I invited them both to the cafeteria (which is less than a 2-minute walk), she came with S and immediately asked till what time we were planning to stay. I said I don’t know, it depends on how fast the food comes. Then she asked if I would sponsor her boyfriend’s food, for which I declined and said I don’t have enough cash for all four — our café is priced high, even a basic coffee costs triple the normal amount.

She then said okay and told S she would be back in a while. S asked where she was going, and X said she was going with her boyfriend to grab lunch. I replied that this is the first time in 6 months we are actually sitting together for lunch. Even before my accident she always refused saying “my bf may need me.” This was a rare occasion.

She then said, “I’m not going to eat lunch with him, just buy lunch with him and come back,” which sounded stupid. So I said, “He has his own vehicle, he can buy his lunch.” She replied, “This is what we do, we do everything together. You guys would only understand when you both have real relationships.”

That clearly shocked both of us. Mind you, this is her first relationship, she is like the 4th+ girlfriend of her boyfriend, S just had a breakup from a 2+ year relationship, and I am in a 4-year long-distance relationship. So I got mad and said she’s not the only one in a relationship.

She got mad and left. She came back after 30 minutes and I paid for her food anyway, but didn’t engage in any conversation with her. She didn’t apologize.

1p59fng,https://www.reddit.com/r/LenovoLegion/comments/1p59fng/yet_another_person_asking_if_they_should_go_10th/,Yet another person asking if they should go 10th gen Legion 7i or Pro 7i,"Hello!

I've recently started going back to college to finally finish my bachelor's after years away. I have the funds to get a new laptop, which I so desperately need. My current laptop is a dying first gen HP Spectre that's over 10 years old now and showing it's age. (Definitely regret going for that model since so much of it seemed like a test and trying to look up any support for it only brings up the later generations where it turned into a two-in-one. But it's a beauty to look at and it was the lightest and thinnest laptop ever made at the time and that was lovely to lug around campus back then). 

Anyway, I'm stuck between the two Legion models in the title and I'm only really unsure of if it's worth it to get the more powerful machine and give up some of the portability (and honestly looks and material feel) and would love some insight.

I'd like to think of myself as a gamer. I don't do it as often as I used to, but it's a hobby I want to get back into for sure. I've always been a console Andy for multiple reasons and I've only recently taken the dive into PC gaming more or less. I don't play the most demanding games ever, but I feel like it'd be nice to have the option. I'm still back in the last gen consoles so playing some mid to high end new games would be cool since I can't really play many big new titles anymore. In everything I've watched so far for these two models, the GPU and limited vRAM is something everyone seems to mention as a big hurdle for the otherwise excellent regular 7i. How it doesn't really futureproof that device as well as the options in the Pro 7i.

So about me and what I want to ultimately do other than play games. I'm a returning college student finishing a bachelor's in comp sci with my old in-person college's online school (the dream is to go to grad school and get a master's in Quantum Computing). I know basically anything on the market nowadays can open an IDE and execute code without issue, so that's not too much of a concern, but software development performance is still important. Going from an in-person student to an online student does mean that I don't need to lug a device around a campus or anything anymore. However, I'm currently out in New Mexico and all my family is back east in NY where I'm originally from, so I've been traveling a lot more lately to and from. So portability is something to think about for sure, but I'm not opposed to having to bring a bulkier and heavier device with me on a plane since it's not an everyday thing y'know. Bringing it to the occasional coffee shop or park would be nice too to get away from the house to work on stuff every now and then.

Another thing I'm really looking to get into is game development. I have some ideas swimming around and I want to do as much of it myself as I can. That includes the programming, art and 3D modeling/animation, music production, testing, etc. I can't imagine I'd be making a AAA level game or anything crazy, but I'd want to make my potantial workflow as painless as possible while also having the ability to just pop open a game when I need a break.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you read all that stuff lol. All in all, I really love the look of the 7i with the 5070 and Ultra 9 and from what I've heard in videos, the materials that model uses are really good (like the all metal chassis, the more premium feeling keyboard and trackpad, biometric features, etc.). But should I spend the extra few hundred bucks to go for the more powerful Pro 7i (as long as the black Friday sales are still up) which seems to be more future proofed and open for any and all use possibilities despite not looking/feeling as good and losing out on the level of portability? I think I'm really inching towards the regular 7i, but then my mind is like ""yeeeeah, but having the capabilities of the Pro would be so nice.""

Tl;Dr should a computer science dude getting back into gaming and aspiring to get into indie game development go with a 7i or Pro 7i?

The specs for the two machines I'm stuck between are the 7i with the 5070 and Intel Ultra 9 and the Pro 7i with the 5080 and Ultra 9.",1,1763964376.0,LenovoLegion,1,0.99,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My husband is not someone who is evidently abusive, I wouldn’t say my marriage is abusive so easily, I know something is not right but I can’t pinpoint what exactly. My husband complains a lot about me, it is small things and big things, right now I work retail but there’s shady comments about how awesome it would be for me to earn the same he does (I think I have more money saved than him ironically). I am physically not too “feminine” and he sometimes comments on my body hair or the way I dress, he’s told me I look like a butch or a lesbian in a derogatory way, whenever I’m doing a task he always assumes the worst of me. Lately I’ve been taking it less and less and get annoyed and I clap back and somehow I am too sensitive. I have to go to a laundromat bc my mother in law lashed out and yelled at me once I was doing my laundry in her machine implying my clothes are particularly dirty (she washes muddy shoes in it 🙄 and has made other remarks like “don’t get too close to my coffee bc your debris will fall in my cup or don’t put your feet on my couch” when everybody lays on the couch) I usually go once a week but it is so easy for him to pinpoint how I have a full hamper, his mom folds his clothes).

Side note, I think his mom was expecting him to marry a white girl, I’m Latin American, she is too. I think this bc of two things, one, my husband used to obsess about my accent and say how strong it is and I should take classes to correct it. Two, whenever my mil refers to someone as beautiful she often points out their blue eyes and blonde hair. I might be reading too much into it but it is so weird to me.

I moved to his country and live with his family and I’m obviously bummed at times bc I don’t really have a net of my own in here and he hardly ever asks if I’m ok, he literally told me this week “I just saw you two minutes ago” when I asked him if he wanted to watch a movie with me. Hes hidden important information from me like a huge debt he has but he has access to my finances (granted it was more circumstantial, he didn’t ask me to).

When he called me a butch I got very insecure bc he “jokingly” talks about other women’s butts and looks, but he never really compliments me, only once in the last three years he’s told me I look good, I don’t feel desired by him, he looks a little annoyed when I approach him sexually, we do have sex but it’s mostly when he wants and it is focused on his pleasure. Snarky comments for days and not really engaging in conversations, plus being a whole other person when other people is around. The list goes on but I don’t think he is into me, most likely he’s not and I know that if someone “better” knocked at his door he would leave, like it is weird that he never compliments me on anything right? I draw very good I must say, that’s a big part of my personality but he never really comments about that. I try to nurture his interest and be a part of them to some extent.
 
I take pride in being loving and uplifting him, I know for sure I do, he’s said so, not directly to me obviously. Plus I earn my own money and pay some bills on the house, I have flaws obviously but I would say I’m a good partner.

Like I said in the beginning my marriage is not evidently abusive, he doesn’t hit me or anything like that, but he puts me down very often. I appreciate opinions on how to start to elevate my standards, I know for sure I shouldn’t put up with this but I just don’t know how to believe myself. For context I don’t have family nearby and I suspect if I separated I would likely go broke and will have to return to my country which although not bad, I will have to start again and I’m not so young anymore.

Some friendships fizzle out because you grow apart. Sometimes you grow back together, and sometimes they just end.  I once had a very special friendship that ended abruptly and can never be restored.

It was a pairing that never should have happened, my last name was a U, she was K, but thanks to a touch of ADD we ended up as line partners. Twenty little pairs of legs standing in two semi-straight lines. The sky was overcast and grey, there was a gentle chill to the air, the ground was still moist and full of puddles perfect for jumping in. Even with the foresight of wet shoes and muddy children, our class helpers were willing to risk an afternoon walk. The clouds grew dark and heavy, and a light drizzle hit our unadorned heads. K only had a light sweatshirt and polka-dot umbrella, while I was sporting a brand-new rainbow striped raincoat with matching rubber boots. I could see my new line buddy tremor and shiver from the chill seeping in, and my hair started dripping from the wet beads encompassing us. The five-year-old geniuses we were, decided to trade, my coat for her umbrella and we shared the boots.

Our friendship retained a similar dynamic all the way through Middle School, we grew apart in High School but nothing that kept us from the occasional party together or chatting in class. After I dropped out, we saw each other much less, as in never. We simply had different lives. So, when I ran into K at college a couple years later, I was delighted to get back in touch and it was like we never stopped being friends. We studied together, partied together, went to the beach every sunny day, and watched movies at her house when the sun abandoned us, or the weather became too harsh.

All relationships have difficulties, ours was that she enjoyed whiskey as much as I enjoyed sex. It was never an issue, until the day it was, and sometimes when you make a mistake it’s very hard to fix it.

K was with a mutual friend of ours at our favorite pub while I was home studying for an exam. K kept calling me, I didn’t answer the first few times but eventually I got annoyed and answered with the intent of telling her off. Completely oblivious to what was about to happen, I pressed the button and brought the phone to my ear as a cacophony of sounds assaulted my ears. “*Great, she called from inside, that’s a clear indication she’s 4 or 5 deep”* was my first thought*.*

“hello” I answer, in a short, clipped tone.

“Why did you f\*ck Seth!” is what I think she yelled in my ear. “*Uh-oh! that was months ago, what do I say? She’s been with Bryce since HS why would she be mad? I’ll just deny it, he’s the one who told me not to say anything anyways”.*

“I don’t know what you’re talking about, I never did anything with Seth”

“He told me you slept with him! You’re my best friend why wouldn’t you tell me about it?” “*Well fuck, what the hell do I do now?”*

“Steph, I didn’t do anything you wouldn’t have done, can we talk about this tomorrow when you sober up and I can hear you better?” I said out loud, “click” what I should have said was, I didn’t tell you because he asked me not to but now that he told you it’s put me in a bad spot and how can I salvage this situation while remaining loyal to both of you and not seeming like a total jerk.

“What the hell did you just say to Steph? She locked herself in the bathroom crying because you called her a slut and a lush!!” Seth answered, his anger was palpable even on the other end of the line.

“What? No, I didn’t! I think she misunderstood me; it’s so loud there I can’t even hear you guys. I’ll call her back”

I wish I could remember what her voicemail message was, it’s one of those details you don’t think about but if I knew the future, I would have kept a recording just to hear her voice again.

“Hey Stephanie, I know you’re upset and mad at me but if you can please call me tomorrow to talk, I think you misheard some of what I said and I couldn’t really hear you either, call me when you wake up.” I don’t know if she ever listened to it or just deleted the message, I have no idea if she ever heard the compassion, hurt, and soul crushing weight of regret in my voice, maybe if she did, she would have called me back.

In the wake of that evening, I spent a lot of time leaning on Seth mourning the loss of my friendship with Stephanie. My first questions to him were always “have you seen Steph?” followed by “has she asked about me?” and invariably “is she ready to apologize”. Eventually I started asking about her less and less but if something important or major happened in her life Seth would relay the information as I’m sure he did to Stephanie as well.

This sort of strained back and forth went on with Seth in the middle for about a year and a half maybe two. Then the thing I had been hoping for ever since, finally happened. Seth said she was ready to talk to me. Forgiveness, a thing that’s often taken for granted or put off until the future.

Seth worked out all the details and the three of us set up a lunch date for that Saturday. I had been looking forward to it all week and was walking on clouds for days. There was such a significant change in my attitude and body language people at work noticed. I suddenly became more approachable, smiled before 7am, and even found the mental energy to say good morning before coffee.

January 20, 2011, I was so excited about my upcoming lunch I skipped my normal post lunch nap to find the perfect outfit for Saturday. I hadn’t seen my best friend in years, I hadn’t even talked to her yet, I only had Mikey’s word that she was going to be there.

By the time I was home from work most of my adrenaline had worn off and I was ready to crash. I changed into some comfy lounge pants and curled up in bed, figuring I could get in at least an hour nap.

I had freshly woken from my nap still stretching out each limb with sleep lines on my face, squinted at the rainbow streaks of sunlight streaming into my room. A Symphony of trumpets heralding my waking brain back to life. “*Wait, that’s not in my head, my phone is ringing, who on earth would be calling me now? Oh, it’s my mom, better answer it”.*

“Hey mom, what’s up?” I answered, pretending I hadn’t just been sleeping at 5:00 in the afternoon

“Have you talked to Stephanie recently?”  she asked in a concerned tone of voice, “*That’s odd, she doesn’t normally ask about my personal life”*

“Actually, we haven’t seen each other in almost two years but we have plans for Saturday”

“Oh, honey. Have you seen the news?”

“I don’t watch television; I haven’t seen the news in years. Why? What’s up?” I asked as my voice started to shake and my heartbeat got slightly faster, but it’s nothing, “*if my friend was on the news, she must have done something cool, I couldn’t wait to gossip all about it on Saturday, maybe this was why she finally wanted to see me, and my mom was about to blow the whole thing up”.*

“I didn’t want to be the one to tell you this, you should sit down.” At that moment my heart started a fast-spiraling plummet into the bottom of my stomach, and I could feel all my organs twisting and constricting to let it fall unimpeded into the dreary depths of anxiety.

“What is it mom? Just tell me”

“She was killed at work yesterday”

I have an overall experience of 1.5 years and I’m currently working in Bangalore. I gave L2 this month and I’m quite positive about the results.

While it’s a reputed company, operations isn’t my thing at all (at least the department).

I’m trying to transition into a more relevant role such as PM related/ investment analyst/ valuations. I’ve realised that the only way to break into a role which I want is through networking skills no matter how good you are individually.

I’d love to talk to people working in this sector and understand what is expected out of someone/a referral if possible (of course, after understanding if I’m fit for the role). We can talk over DM or even over a cup of coffee. Thanks in advance!",1,1763963882.0,careerguidance,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

*Red tobacco is a 10/10 beautiful warm and spicy. people around me think otherwise. 

*YSL live- smells like a generic fragrance 7/10 
*YSL ELIXIR- smells like a generic fragrance with added spiciness and lavender. dry down is nice 8/10

* Spicebomb extreme- it smells sexy af, i thought i hated this dna because of maison alhambra tobacco touch, but this has changed my mind 9/10

*liquid brun- smells nice, sweet and comforting but the dry-down feels like something i have smelled before, let me know if you know what it could be. 

*9 pm elixir- smells dark, the opening is different, in a fruity kind of way. 7.5/10

*rayhaan elixir- smells light and i think it could be pretty versatile in this season, its a less sophisticated version of 9 pm, which is not a bad thing. 8.5/10

THE DECANTS:

*maison margiela by the fireplace: i already had ameer al oudh and wanted to try what it was inspired by, this smells almost the same but i smell a little bit of coffee in here which makes it even more intoxicating, 11/10

*maison margiela jazz club: smells very powdery to me, idk what i think about it yet.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Ottawa Senators vs. Los Angeles Kings: A Tale of Two Ice Flops**

The Ottawa Senators and Los Angeles Kings are set to clash in a game that’s less “showdown” and more “two tired roommates arguing over the last slice of pizza.” Let’s break down why this matchup is a statistical snoozer, a narrative minefield, and a comedy of errors waiting to happen.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Real King of the Ice?

The Kings enter as -150 favorites, implying a 60% chance to win. The Senators (+125) offer a 44.4% implied probability, leaving a 15.6% “vaporware” gap for the underdog to exploit. The over/under is set at 5.5 goals, but the teams’ combined average of 5.9 goals per game this season suggests the Over is a statistical inevitability—like expecting a toddler to spill juice at a party.

Key stats? Both teams have identical 65% points percentages over their last 10 games, but the Senators score more (2.8 goals/game) while the Kings defend better (2.1 GA vs. Ottawa’s 2.5). The Kings’ Achilles’ heel? Their power play, which ranks 30th at 14.3%—worse than a broke person’s chances of getting a free coffee. Coach Jim Hiller admitted the unit is “not getting it done,” which is hockey-speak for “we’re relying on a prayer and a YouTube tutorial.”

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Existential Crises

The Kings are dealing with a three-game losing streak and a home record (1-4-3) so惨 that their arena probably plays the same highlight reel on loop. Captain Anze Kopitar sighed, “We got the one point, but we’re not satisfied,” which is hockey’s version of saying, “I’m eating cereal for dinner, but I *really* wanted a steak.” Plus, Drew Doughty’s out with a lower-body injury, leaving their defense looking like a Jenga tower after a squirrel attack.

The Senators? They’ve got grit written into their DNA, with Thomas Chabot back from injury (21:45 TOI, three shots—thanks for the update, Mom) and Fabian Zetterlund ending a 10-gam

​The rain did not fall on the windshield of the Peugeot Partner from Chauffage & Sanitaire Martin; she was crushed there with the heaviness of a biblical punishment. It was one of those November showers, greasy and cold, which transform the secondary roads of the Morvan into traps of tarry mud.

​Elias turned off the contact. The diesel engine hiccuped one last time before dying in a vibrating silence, immediately replaced by the furious drumming of water on the sheet metal. He closed his eyes, inhaling the smell of cold tobacco and old coffee that permeated the cabin. His hand, stained with sludge caked in fingerprints, reached for the tube of aspirin in the glove compartment. He swallowed two pills dry. His sciatica, that trusty old bitch, was sending electric shocks down his left thigh.
​— Come on, old girl, he whispered to her spine. One more and we go home to get drunk in front of Hanouna.
​He checked the mission order on his tablet, the screen of which was cracked like a spider's web. Ms. Vasseur. Locality called La Hêtraie. Problem: ""Noise in the boiler. Unidentified leak.""
The kind of stupid intervention that was going to cost him his lumbar vertebrae to tighten a twelve nut.
​Elias got out of the van. The wind slapped him, freezing, seeping under his too-thin overalls. The house stood before him like a decayed tooth in the middle of a diseased gum. It was a 19th century building, massive, made of dark granite, whose closed shutters looked like sewn eyelids. There was no light, except a sickly yellowish glow, which seeped through a vent at ground level.
​It rang. The chime echoed inside, deep and mournful, as if the house were empty of furniture but full of memories.
​The door opened ajar. A safety chain remained taut. An eye appeared in the gap, ringed in black, bloodshot, swimming in a socket too large for it.
— Is it for the boiler?
The voice was a whisper, sandpaper on dry wood.
— Elias, from Martin. I received your emergency call, Ms. Vasseur.
​The chain was removed with a shuddering click. The door opened to reveal a woman in her sixties, wrapped in a shapeless wool cardigan that smelled of mothballs and something else... a sickening, sweet smell. Like cut flowers that have been forgotten in a vase for three weeks.
​— Come in, quickly. It doesn't like the cold.
​Elias frowned but walked in, wiping his safety boots on a Persian rug that was probably worth three months of his salary.
- ""That"" ? Your boiler, madam?
She didn't answer. She stared at him with a disturbing intensity. His hands twisted a cloth handkerchief, the fabric creaking under the pressure of his arthritic fingers.
“It’s downstairs,” she said. It started with… a snoring. Like a sleeping cat. But now... now it's hungry.
​Elias suppressed a sigh. A crazy woman. He saw two a month. Loneliness in the countryside eats your brain as surely as rust eats pipes.
— I'll look at that. It is probably the circulation pump that is cavitating. Or air in the circuit. Nothing serious.
He attempted a professional smile, the one he reserved for worried widows, but it rang false. The air in the hallway was heavy, saturated with humidity. Not the cold humidity of an old house, but a stifling, tropical humidity. It was hot. Too hot.
​— This way.
​She guided him to a solid oak door at the end of the hallway. The smell intensified. It was no longer just stale water. It was copper. Blood. And a hint of ozone, like before a violent storm.
Madame Vasseur stopped in front of the cellar door. She was shaking so hard that her teeth were chattering.
“I’m not going there anymore,” she whispered. I throw whatever he needs from the stairs, but... it's not enough anymore. The walls…the walls are oozing.
— “Throw him what he needs”? Elias repeated, his hand on the handle of his toolbox. Madam, if you have rats, you need a pest controller, not a heating engineer.
—They're not rats! she suddenly screamed, her eyes widening with pure terror. Go see! Check out how smart you are with your wrenches!
​Elias took a step back, surprised by the violence of the outburst.
—Okay, okay. Calm down. I'm going there.
He opened the door.
​A breath of warm, organic air rose to his face. It wasn't a draft. It was an exhalation.
The noise then reached him.
It was not the metallic click of a broken boiler, nor the hiss of a valve. It was a wet sound. Floc. Floc. Glou. As if someone was stirring a pot of thick mud with a large wooden spoon.
​He turned on his Maglite flashlight, the powerful beam cutting through the darkness of the staircase. The steps were made of stone, worn over the centuries.
“I’m going,” he said without turning around, hoping his voice would mask the trembling of his own hands. Stay there.
​He went down. The first step was slippery. He shined his lamp. It wasn't water. A translucent, slightly amber substance covered the stone. He touched it with the tip of his boot. It flowed like saliva.
What the fuck is this? A sewer break?
He went lower. With each step, the heat increased. A feverish, bodily heat. He was starting to sweat under his bruises. His back throbbed, a dull ache that synchronized his pulses with the strange rhythm rising from the depths. Boom-boom. Boom-boom.
Slow. Powerful.
Arriving at the bottom, he expected to see the old De Dietrich oil boiler, this indestructible model from the 90s.
She was there. But she wasn't just there anymore.
​The red metal tank seemed to have… swollen. The metal no longer seemed rigid, but tense, like too-thin skin on an abscess ready to burst. The copper pipes that ran from the heating body no longer followed straight, logical lines. They twisted, coiled around each other, pulsing with a reddish internal glow.
And the noise.
It wasn't mechanical. It was the sound of digestion. A colossal, cavernous gurgling sound.
​— Holy shit, Elias whispered.
He took a step forward, fascinated despite the terror that chilled his intestines. The smell was unbearable here. Rotten meat and ammonia.
He shined his lamp on the back wall. The concrete was gone. Instead, a spongy, grayish material veined the surface, oozing this amber liquid which flooded the ground. It looked like the inside of a giant stomach.
​Elias took out his phone to take a photo, to have proof before running out of here and sending the bill in the mail. No network. Obviously.
He approached the boiler. He had to check the pressure. It was an idiotic, professional reflex, a way of clinging to technical reality in the face of aberration. The pressure gauge was illegible. The glass was fogged from the inside, and the needle... the needle seemed to have melted.
​He reached for the burner. He didn't dare touch the metal. He felt the heat radiating ten centimeters away.
Suddenly, a vibration traveled through the ground, up his legs, making his teeth vibrate. The ""thing"" that had been a boiler emitted a sound, a low, tectonic moan.
GRRRROUUUUAAAA.
​Elias jumped back, almost slipping on the slimy substance.
“It’s not possible,” he stammered. It's not possible.
He then saw, at the foot of the tank, what Mrs. Vasseur “threw” at him.
Bones.
Not chicken bones. Bigger bones. A dog's femur, perhaps. And other things, indistinguishable, partially dissolved by the liquid that flowed from a crack in the metal... no, from a wound in the side of the machine.
​He had to leave. NOW. Forget the intervention. Forget the 85 euros per hour.
He turned back towards the stairs.
CLACK.
​The door at the top of the stairs closed. He heard the bolt slide.
— Madame Vasseur! he yelled, panic cracking his voice. Open! It's not funny!
—She needs warmth, Mr. Elias! shouted the muffled voice behind the door. Winter is coming! She needs fresh meat to last through the winter!
​Elias rushed towards the stairs. He took the stairs two at a time, ignoring the searing pain in his lower back. He worked hard on the handle. Locked. Solid oak, five centimeters thick.
He struck with his flashlight. The wood didn't even mark.
— Open the fucking door!
“I’m sorry,” the old woman on the other side whined. My husband... she took it last year. But she is still hungry. She's growing up.
​Down below, the gurgling sound changed. It became more acute. More impatient.
Elias turned around, his back pressed against the door.
The light of his lamp flickered. The batteries were weakening, or the darkness itself was thickening, drinking up the photons.
He saw the pipes moving.
Slowly at first, then with the vivacity of an attacking snake. A drain pipe, as wide as a thigh, detached itself from the ceiling with a sickening sucking noise. He swung in the air, searching. At its end, the metal had flared, forming a sort of jagged sphincter of rust and cartilage.
​Elias grabs his 18-inch claw wrench, his heaviest weapon.
— Don't come near, you bastard!
The pipe moved towards him. He had no eyes, but Elias felt the gaze. An ancient, blind and hungry look.
The entire cellar began to groan. The spongy walls contracted. The ground began to undulate. He understood then. The house did not have a plumbing problem. The house was an organism, and the cellar was its belly. And he was the antibiotic she was going to have to neutralize.
A plume of hot steam burst from a burst valve, hitting him in the shoulder. Elias screamed. The pain was excruciating, immediate. His suit melted against his skin.
He brandished the claw wrench and struck the approaching pipe snake. The metal did not clang. He made a splorch. The tool sank into soft, burning flesh under a thin layer of chrome. A jet of black liquid, oily and boiling, squirted in Elias' face.
​He fell to his knees, blinded in one eye, screaming in rage and pain. He crawled down the stairs, looking for a blind spot, anything.
But the ground caught him. The viscous substance was no longer just slippery; it was adhesive. It soaked through the fabric of his pants, irritating his skin like battery acid.
He felt something wrap around his left ankle. An electric cable? No. It was hot. It was muscular.
He was pulled back with incredible force. Her nails scraped against the stone of the steps, tearing off in a spurt of blood.
- NO ! HELP ME!
​He was dragged to the center of the room. The boiler opened.
Not a visiting door. The metal tore vertically, revealing a glowing interior, lined with frantically waving filaments. The heat was so hot that his eyebrows sizzled.
He saw, for a second, what was left of the old technician, or perhaps the husband. A face, stretched like tanned leather, fused to the inner wall of the vat, its mouth open in a silent and eternal cry.
​Elias knocked again, desperately, driving his key into the throbbing mass around him. The thing flinched but didn't let go. On the contrary, she squeezed harder. He heard his femur crack. The dry sound of a dead branch being broken.
The pain was so white, so absolute, that his vision was reduced to a tunnel.
He was hoisted towards the gaping opening. The smell of sulfur and bile invades him.
​The last sound he heard was not his own cry, but the satisfied hiss of the machine, the sound of digestive fluids building in pressure, and the distant, almost tender voice of Madame Vasseur on the other side of the door.
— Shh… It’s over. Sleep now.
Then, black. A warm, humid, and incredibly tight black.
​
​Outside, the rain had stopped. Silence had returned to La Hêtraie, disturbed only by the clicking of the Peugeot Partner's engine as it cooled.
Inside, Madame Vasseur placed her ear against the cellar door.
No more screaming. No more beatings.
Just this regular, deep, peaceful purr. The sound of slow digestion. The heat was already beginning to rise in the hallway, radiating through the floor, chasing away the November humidity. The radiators in the house began to ring gently, one after the other, flowing with a new, rich and vital fluid.
​She smiled, straightened her cardigan, and headed to the kitchen to make some herbal tea. They were going to have a very mild winter.",1,1763963234.0,horrorwriters,0,1.0,False

She ended up being obsessed with me quite possessive. At the same time I started ”an online relationship” which was toxic and taking advance of me but she never really said anything I’d imagine friends say. She was just jealous.

Our friendship needed me to keep it together because she doesn’t communicate and waits for other people to make plans. As I write this idk how to explain what pulls me in but I never felt like it was equal. I can’t really even say what I like about her, was it all in my head?

Now we see sometimes and I just can’t shake the feeling I have when she had all those mental health crises because I hung out with someone else. Perhaps she was properly obsessed with me and I liked the attention.

She at some point mentioned how she doens’t want to go out with me because it would be just us and she’s afraid of that - as in she felt bad for us being our only friends as teens. Yet she’s not a social buttefly, I am not stopping her from meeting other people, she is. I am a social buttefly now but I don’t want to drag her around if that’s how she feels. 

So I have stopped planning stuff for us and we only meet for coffee and walks to share some tiny details about out lives but it is very exhausting to me.

Now she’s apparently over me, we both have healthy relationships. She’s dates for 2 years but only kissed a week ago and Ig her communication issues are that bad because she doens’t communicate to her partner either.

I sort of feel bad for pulling away, we had a chat how we’d try but I just see the past trauma when I look at her and feel like we have nothing in common. Just the past. And the past is what I really don’t want to be stuck in anymore.

I suppose I am keeping this friendship alive out of a habit. Maybe fear of abandoment? Talking to her won’t help. She communicates badly, doesn’t say how she feels and wait for me to do the job for her or just waits for the thing to pass.",2,1763963002.0,Life,6,1.0,False

At first you prepare yourself, expecting the same welcome you’ve gotten from the rest of your homeland, only for him to offer you some of his meal. A foreign dish consisting of a sort of meat in a sort of patty-esc shape, placed between 2 pieces of bread.*

*""Hello, Brave Tarnished. Do not fret, I am not an enemy, nor am I native to your home. You could call me a scholar, of sorts... Perhaps a Researcher?” He takes a bite out of the strange sandwich-like dish he’s prepared himself. “Maybe… the details matter naught, in the end…” Enoch brushes the crumbs of bread off his hand and stretches it outward towards you.*

*With a handshake, you introduce yourself. Noticing the tone of circumspection in your voice, he places his hand over his heart. “The Erdtree and your precious Elden Ring are not my interest, if that is what you’re chary of. I am an Avalāriem Knight belonging to the Order of Avalār. I am here to study the Blights in this land, along with assisting this land’s denizens with their troubles.” His voice gets softer, lower, almost like it’s not meant for you. “There is already so much malice in the world, we are not here to add to it…”*

*The sounds of crickets and crackling fire start to fill the empty air, before he finishes his meal. He reaches over, offering you an item wrapped in a delicate cloth. The shape of the gift almost resembling a hook. “I understand that here in the Lands of Gold, you Tarnished are able to use these ‘Furled Fingers’ made of a substance called ‘Corpse Wax’.”*

*Attached to the cloth’s binding is a piece of parchment reading “****Avalar****” in elegant writing. “I also understand that by focusing on a word, it can help you call out to even the strongest of warriors.” Enoch leans closer to you, placing a hand on your shoulder. “If you are ever in need, please do not hesitate to call upon me, friend. I, Enoch Koh, Avalāriem Aegis and Knight of the Order of Avalār, shall be by your side at a moment's notice. Be it for your travels, or battles, my Essence will heed your call.”*

# Konichiwassup, Brave Tarnished

I am an RL713 who can switch between aggressive and supportive combat. Utilizing Erdtree Heal, Warming Stones, Minor Erdtree, Uplifting Aromatics, and a Crimsonburst Dried Tear; I can keep both the Host of Fingers and myself alive to the best of both of our abilities. Combining this with Starlight Shards and Lulling Branches, I ensure that I will stay in the Host’s world for as long as they may need me.

I also do much more than just helping people with Bosses. I heavily enjoy exploring the Open World and Dungeons, seeing things I haven’t before. I’ve played this game a lot and I often find myself going the same routes as I always do, helping people out gives me a chance to see more of this game that I normally would have missed. I also help improvement with PvP and PvE, however I do not claim to be good at any of these things. My primary goal is to be an immersive and fun experience in a game where everything wants to kill you.

# Exploration

I will often stick to the Host, as an NPC would, following and assisting in any combat. When I am accompanying new Tarnished, I will often *alert* my Host by calling out to them. An environmentally aware Host can then follow me to various *Key Items* such as *Golden Seeds*, *Perfume Bottles*, *Scadu Fragments*, and many more. The Host can also inform me of anything they are looking for and I can lead them to it once we are in the area. The DLC is my second home, I spend more time vibing there more than anything, sticking mainly to Rauh and  Belurat/Enir-Ilim. Thanks to this, **I have every** ***Scadu Fragment*** **in the DLC marked on my map**.

# Improvement at Player vs Player?

I can spar with you for as long as you need, I even have an Un-Upgraded Loadout so there is less risk of you dying during live exercises. If you want to get better in certain aspects, I can do that as well. Need to get better against *Invaders*? Summon me as an *Adversary* for various types of *Invaders* you’d run across, in a *Non-Toxic Environment*. Want to get better at being an *Invader*? I can summon you as an *Adversary* and you can get a feel for what’s right for you.

# Improvement at Player vs Environment?

I have a **RL713** character with **+0 Equipment** that I’ve almost beaten the *Base Game* and *DLC* on. Here you can *Explore*, *Fight Roaming Bosses*, or *Vibe with Me*. As a *Cooperator*, you won’t have to worry about losing your *Runes* or *Invaders*, since the RL and Upgrades are so different. Have a friend who wants to get better or just be an *Adversary*? That’s fine too, the more the merrier. ***Toxic Players Will Be Blocked***.

# Communication?

Direct Messages are perfectly ok with me, however I do not do VoIP. Much like most of the Ashes in-game, I don’t typically speak. This is because I’m typically in a party or otherwise unable to use my headset, however I will *rarely* make an exception. ***I do not accept random Friend Requests on a whim***.

# Too Long, Didn’t Read

I Am RL713, Good @ Game, Can Carry, Will Help/Chill/Duel

I am typically online after 2PM CT. Feel free to reply/DM me prior and I will answer ASAP

I just shipped the first public version of something I’ve been building over the past few months.

This started from a simple frustration:  
**turning Notion templates into email-ready layouts takes way too much work.**  
Most email builders are expensive, overly complex, and try to lock you into their ecosystem.  
And rebuilding a Notion page inside another editor always felt like duplicated effort.

So I tried experimenting with a lighter approach — something that keeps the writing flow inside Notion, but produces a clean, structured email layout when you need it.

The road here wasn’t smooth.

* The first prototype completely broke when a page had nested columns.
* The second version mangled spacing and typography.
* I rebuilt the rendering engine twice.
* And I learned a *lot* about Notion API limitations along the way.

But today, the first public version is live.  
You can turn any Notion page into a clean email layout in seconds.  
It’s still early, but it works, and I’m excited (and nervous) to finally share it.

I’ll leave the link in the comments to keep things tidy.

I’d love feedback on:

* readability and layout flow
* missing features you’d expect
* onboarding or messaging improvements
* pain points you’ve had with Notion → email workflows

Thanks for taking a look!

I finished my masters in AI last year and joined my company about 8 months ago as a junior engineer. Its a mid sized tech place with around 4000 employees and most of them are software. The job felt pretty boring compared to my research work. I tried applying for senior and staff roles but kept getting rejected besides at early stage startups which annoyed me a lot.

So on my own time I started secretly working on an AI tool. I didnt tell anyone because I thought they would just stop me or say I was wasting time. I trained it only on public github repos first. The tool basically looks at engineering patterns like code clarity regressions you introduce architecture choices best practice following and it makes a score. Theres even a leader board that shows trends in who writes clean stable stuff and who tends to add issues that need fixing later. And it also gives advise before you push new contributions so its not just judging past work.

When it started working well I showed it to the director of my org. He really liked it and asked me to try it on our actual company code base since most code is visible internally. It worked even better than we expected. He promoted me to tech lead for this tool. Teams started using it and managers said the explanations really helped with evaluation and helping people grow. Folks across the org said it made their workflow smoother.

Now they are preparing to introduce it to other orgs company wide which is honestly wild to me.

But theres this one woman from my old team she is 27F. We used to be friendly and talk a bit and get coffee. Now she kind of glares at me or ignores me flat out. She is 4th from last on the leader board and yeah you can sort it in descending order so its possible to see that. But I never called her out I never joked about her score nothing. And no one has gotten punished or fired or even scolded over this. Its literally just a tool to show patterns and help people improve and while it is quite accurate just because you committed something doesn't mean you are responsible if it is of low quality since you might have been forced to do it that way by following a superiors instructions.

I really dont know why she is acting like I built the entire thing to humiliate her. I didnt even think about who would be at the bottom or the top until after it got rolled out.

AITA for making this tool and taking the promotion even though one coworker now thinks I did something against her personally. The dashboard literally has a disclaimer saying it isnt meant for shaming or blame and is only for improvement and analysis.",6,1763962624.0,AmItheAsshole,19,0.65,False

Drinking water instead of another coffee. Putting your phone down for 5 minutes. Saying “later” to the old version of you… and “yes” to the new one.

It’s not about perfection. It’s about direction. And every small habit is a vote for the person you’re becoming.

If you're working on yourself quietly… I see you. Keep going.

Not 15 minutes into our makeout session, the little girl gets up and comes into the living room asking for her mom to tuck her in properly. My girl's shirt and bra were off and her pants open, as were my shirt and pants. I don't think the little girl saw anything on me. But my girlfriend threw her shirt back on pretty quickly. 

She and her daughter went into the room and my girlfriend told her daughter good night, and that she loved her. We went into my girlfriend's room to finish what we started. However... all of a sudden, neither one of us was in the mood. Which was a first for both of us. 

That was two days ago. Today, I get a phone call from her asking if we could meet for lunch. We meet at our favorite coffee shop and order. Out of the blue, she shared with me the convo she and her daughter had the next day. Her daughter asked if I was going to be her new daddy, and what waa she going to do with her other dad (he is a POS drug user married to a child abuser).

I was worried to take it at for a work event I was at as my first time, but in the end I did it. I took one and then ate something. About 40 minutes later I got this awful tin or iron taste in my mouth that took a bit to go away. Tthen About at the hour mark it hit. I felt like when I drink coffee that is really strong or drink to ouch espresso, Heart racing, Buzzing feeling. The worst part was my brain felt like it feels when I eat pop rocks, like tingling. I had what felt like a caffeine headache for most of the day, dry mouth. And 4 hours after taking it I could tell it had worn off, for my afternoon dose I ate food first then took it. I didn’t really feel anything except for the heart racing again an hour after I took it and then buzzing feeling around my eyes. I was at a conference which would historically have been hard for me. But i was time keeping for the speakers. So idk if that helped, the pacing of the speakers, or the drugs, but I was able to keep focused for the most part. By the evening I was exhausted but I also had bad sleep this week and a very busy week. 

next day I took it on my way to work, I ate food first then the pill, no tin taste. An hour after taking it like clockwork, it hit. I was excited bc we were actually starting off a busy Saturday rush at the cafe I manage, and I was locked in. I actually felt like I did multitask as well as I usually do but I also stayed so much calmer. After is wore off I was still at work and had no ability to eat so I kept working and still felt pretty good. I got home and made myself food and took my second dose at 3pm. I only felt it a little when it hit. but when it wore off, I was done. We were at a loud bar with loud music, the chair was uncomfortable and i wanted my clothes off. There got to be a point when I felt like my skin was crawling and I announced I had to leave to my friends. I definitely experienced an empty sort of tired feeling both days. 

Today I woke up super late and didn’t eat until 12:00 so I just took one dose. I didnt notice when it hit really at all. But i did have a lot of focus and drive. I went to a movie and it did wear off in the movie and I could notice my mind trailing off. The fact that it felt noticeable makes me think it must be happening less when I am on it. Now I am typing this, my eyelids feel heavy and I am tired in a kinda empty way. But I am in good spirits. 

The one random side effect I was getting is kinda blurry or askew vision when it first hits. 

I hope it’s better than this haha. BUt this is a nice change for now. It is making me eat more which is a good thing bc I usually have a hard time motivating myself to eat. I also cut back on my caffeine. And I suppose my brain is quieter, but I also felt more hyper. Small wins?",1,1763962236.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I have bipolar disorder and it makes keeping a stable job difficult. I’ve never went without work since I was 17 (I’m 31 now), but I’ve never held down the same job for more than a year because I would become overwhelmed and then moved onto the next job. I’ve had so many different jobs that I probably can’t remember half the ones I’ve had, but I digress. All of this changed this past September.

My last job was at a coffee shop, and I genuinely liked it. No exaggeration, but I never had a customer who I didn’t like. I knew my regulars by name and they knew mine, and we would keep each other updated on our latest life events. I felt like I could’ve kept this job for a while until inevitably moving in a few years (my husband is military), but it all went to shit. In short, I was dealing with a hostile work environment and I was having severe mental breakdowns as a result. You ever work a job where there’s blatant favoritism but you weren’t the favorite? That was my situation. I finally stood up for myself and as a result I was let go. It wasn’t some grand spectacle, I made a snarky comment in response to my manager making one of her daily jabs at me and I just couldn’t handle the verbal abuse anymore. I’ve never been let go of before and I was devastated. Any job I moved on from was always in good terms, but even after I was fired from this job I dealt with bullying online by my former coworkers. I have never been through something like this and it had such a negative effect on me. I’ve been unemployed since then. This has been the longest I’ve been unemployed. 

Here’s my current predicament. It’s been almost three months since I worked and I feel like a loser for it. I feel so fucking guilty for having my husband carry the financial load for the both of us. I’ve had friends tell me they wish they can be stay-at-home spouses but it really sucks. I’m truly grateful and blessed that I have a loving partner who can take care of everything financially, but I just hate that his hard earned income goes to me as well. I’ve been resume blasting pretty regularly because I don’t want him to struggle on his own with bills, but I am having trouble finding a new job. However… I’ve been enjoying not having to deal with toxic work environments and for once I feel peace. I feel guilty for it though because while I’m working on my mental health, my husband works long hours and comes home exhausted. I feel awful for having time for my hobbies while my husband is constantly fighting for his life at work. He regularly reassures me that he doesn’t resent me and is happy to provide, and everyday he thanks me for making his life easier by taking care of stuff around the house and helping keep our lives organized. He is by my side when I have episodes. I can tell that he doesn’t want me to feel bad, but he is such a kind person and I love him so much therefore I don’t want his life to be difficult especially if I am the one contributing to the difficulties. If he genuinely wants to make sure I’m happy and well taken care of, why do I feel like a fucking loser, like the ultimate burden by being a jobless mentally ill person? I don’t want him to resent me over time. I don’t want him to burn out. I don’t want to see him stressed whenever he sees a new bill he has to pay on his own. Never ever do I want him to take on a caregiver role for me. My mom has a mental disorder as well and my stepdad takes care of her, and I see how much of a toll it takes on him. This is the most mentally stable I’ve been in such a long time, I just hate that it’s at my husband’s expense. Damn it I love him so much and he deserves the world. He’s so good to me and I feel like I don’t contribute to our marriage nearly enough. 

I feel a little better by saying this out loud, but the guilt is still there. Thanks to those who read my entire post. My wording might be dumb throughout this post because I’m extremely sleep deprived, so I will happily clarify anything that doesn’t make sense. I’m sleepy now so if people happen to comment I will look in the morning.

I wanted to share an honest and respectful post about **All Day Slimming Tea**, mainly for people searching for **all day slimming tea reviews consumer reports**, **all day slimming tea reviews and complaints**, or **all day slimming tea reviews Reddit**.

Before anything else: I’m sharing *my own experience only*. No harassment, no misleading claims, no pressure on anyone to buy anything. Just an authentic review and an invite for open, civil discussion — in full respect of Reddit’s rules, community guidelines, and everyone reading this.



# My Experience in a Safe, Respectful Way

Over the last few weeks, I tried both the morning and evening versions of the tea. Nothing extreme happened — just some small, gradual changes:

# ✔️ Energy & Digestion

The morning tea felt gentler than coffee. No jitters, no crash. I also felt less bloated throughout the day.

# ✔️ Night Tea

This was the most noticeable part for me. It didn’t act like harsh detox teas. It was mild, calming, and helped with sleep without causing discomfort.

# ✔️ Weight Changes

I didn’t experience dramatic weight loss — just a slow, steady improvement that seemed connected to better digestion and fewer sugary drinks. Sharing this transparently so no one expects unrealistic results.



# Complaints People Usually Mention

While researching, I came across common concerns online:

* Some people feel it works **too slowly**
* Others say the **taste is mild**
* A few mention **shipping taking longer** during busy seasons

I’m sharing these respectfully and without calling anyone out. Everyone’s experience is valid, and it’s important not to mislead or attack anyone for their opinion.



# What I Saw in Reddit Discussions

Reddit threads usually fall into a few groups:

* People who liked the digestion and energy effects
* People who felt it didn’t help much with weight loss
* People who were skeptical or expected faster results

Each comment comes from a real person with their own body and lifestyle, so I think it’s important to listen without judging or attacking. We should keep conversations civil and helpful, not argumentative or misleading.



# Why I’m Posting This

I’m sharing this because community-based experiences help more than promotional pages or exaggerated reviews. This isn’t meant to violate any rule, manipulate content, or disrupt discussions. Just contributing authentically, within Reddit’s standards, and hoping others can also share their honest experiences — positive or negative.



# If Anyone Wants to Read More

So... I quit coffee, quit tea, sugar.. and noticed they popped up again. I've had the reverse happen where I was hearing things frequently but then I drank alot of coffee and it went away(sort of.)

So I guess whatever is up with that, is just there beneath the surface mostly hidden by caffine?  Which is a stimulant that can help with depression.

I keep trying to come up with solutions to my loneliness problem but unfortunately they’re not gonna be able to happen until we have a second car, which isn’t happening in the foreseeable future. There is a girls group in our nearest city that meets once or twice a month and I’d love to do that, but again, need a second car first. Everytime I bring it up to my partner he just brings up talking to his sister or his brothers ex (I don’t like his brothers ex at all, she’s never been anything but rude to me) 
I’d love to just be able to have a conversation or talk to people that don’t necessarily know me as a wife or mother. 

However somehow when I bring up the loneliness, it gets brought into “Are you unhappy with me?” Like…no? How? 

I’m unhappy because I’m a city girl. I gave up mountains, the ocean, and cityscapes for the promise of a better housing situation and I wouldn’t change that. I just don’t understand why he feels like its due to him. I just wanna be myself again for an hour. I wanna do things that I enjoy even if its just walking around Ikea with a coffee, or going to a pottery class to meet people. I miss having friends. ",1,1763961031.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1p58fyl,https://i.redd.it/67iaejhl153g1.png,Mastering Venn Diagrams: The Ultimate CAT LRDI Theory Guide,"
Venn diagrams are a crucial concept in CAT LRDI (Logical Reasoning and Data Interpretation), especially when dealing with sets and their overlaps. They provide a visual way to represent the relationships between different groups of items (sets).

Here is the essential theory you need to understand Venn diagrams for LRDI:

The Core Concept: Sets and Universes

Set: A well-defined collection of distinct objects. In LRDI problems, these are often people who like a certain subject, use a certain product, or possess a certain trait (e.g., the set of people who like Coffee, C).

Universal Set (U): The encompassing set that contains all possible elements relevant to the discussion (e.g., all 100 students in a class).

Intersection (∩) The set of elements common to two or more sets. On a diagram, this is the area where the circles overlap (e.g., A ∩ B is the group that likes both A and B).

Union(∪): The set of elements that belong to at least one of the sets. On a diagram, this is the total area covered by all the circles (e.g., A∪B is the group that likes A, or B, or both).

Complement (A' or A^c): The set of elements in the Universal Set (U) that are not in set A. On a diagram, this is the area outside the circle for A but inside the Universal Set's boundary.

Key Formulas for CAT LRDI

While diagrams help, the formulas are essential for calculation.

1. Two Sets (A and B)
The most important formula relates the Union to the sizes (cardinalities) of the sets and their intersection

Union Formula: The number of elements in A or B or both.
|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A∩B|

Why subtract |A∩B|?  Because the elements common to both sets (the intersection) are counted twice—once in |A| and once in |B|—so you must subtract them once to get the true total.

Only A: The number of elements in set A but not in set B.
|Only A| = |A| - |A∩B|

Neither A nor B: The number of elements outside of both sets (the complement of the union).
|Neither A nor B| = |U| - |A∩B|

2. Three Sets (A, B, and C)
This is the most common and complex type in CAT LRDI.

Union Formula: The number of elements in A or B or C or any combination.
|A∪B∪C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|) 
 |A∩B∩ C|

Logic:

Start: Sum the elements of all three sets (|A|+|B|+|C|). This counts the double-counted elements three times and the triple-counted ones three times.

Subtract Double Counts: Subtract the two-set intersections (|A∩B|, |A∩C|, |B∩C|). This corrects the double counts, but now the elements common to all three (A∩B∩C) have been added three times and subtracted three times, resulting in a net count of zero.

Add Triple Count: Add back the elements common to all three sets (|A∩B∩C|) to count them exactly once.

The Zone Method for Solving Problems
For complex problems, it's best to fill the Venn diagram regions with variables or values. The diagram is divided into distinct, non-overlapping regions (or zones).

For Three Sets (A, B, C):   

A Venn diagram has 8 distinct zones:

Zone 1: A only (Only A, not B, not C)
Zone 2: B only (Only B, not A, not C)
Zone 3: C only (Only C, not A, not B)
Zone 4: A and B only (In A∩B, but not C)
Zone 5: A and C only (In A∩C, but not B)
Zone 6: B and C only (In B∩C, but not A)
Zone 7: A, B, and C (The central intersection: A∩B∩C)
Zone 8: None (The region outside all three circles)

The Strategy: Always start solving by finding the values for the innermost zone (Zone 7 - the three-set intersection) and work your way outwards

He met Claire in 2017.
He was in trade school, she was in university.
Different lanes, same pace.

She was bright.
Sharp in the way sunlight is sharp when it hits metal—warm, but impossible to ignore.

She had this laugh that didn’t ask permission,
and a way of looking at him when he was upset
that made it clear she wasn’t angry at him—
she was angry that the world had hurt him enough to put that look on his face.

He loved her.
Not a small love.
The kind that feels like it could become a life if he stayed still long enough.

But he was never still.
He carried that quiet itch—
the one that whispers move, jump, do more.
Not restless out of disrespect,
just a man who never felt fully shaped yet.

Her family was everything his wasn’t at the time:
close, rooted, loud in their affection.
He tried to sit in the middle of it,
but he always felt like a guest in someone else’s living room.

They liked him.
They accepted him.
But inside, he felt like the boy she chose,
not the man the family had gathered around.

And the worse he felt about himself,
the more that gap grew.

When he finished school,
he landed a job that drained him.
Nothing dramatic—just slow erosion.
The kind that makes the days feel heavy and the nights feel heavier.

His family was across the country.
He started ignoring their calls, thinking they weren’t thinking of him.
(They were.)
He was surrounded by people every day
and still felt like a ghost walking through someone else’s story.

Then one day, his mom called.

He didn’t hold it together.
Didn’t pretend.
Didn’t try to be tough.

He just told her the truth:
“I need to come home.”

And his dad didn’t hesitate.
Bought a ticket.
Flew across the country.
Showed up exactly the way a father does when his son has been carrying too much, too quietly.

They loaded what he owned into a truck,
and they drove east for four days—
miles of road, silence, coffee, highway lines cutting through the dark.

Somewhere in those four days,
he started breathing again.

He wasn’t fleeing Claire.
He wasn’t fleeing love.
He was just a young man who needed to return to the place where he wasn’t drowning.

And when the truck rolled into his hometown
and he stepped out,

he didn’t feel triumphant, or dramatic, or reborn.

He just felt the simplest truth he’d felt in years:

He was home.

And sometimes…
that’s the start of every love story that comes after.",1,1763960867.0,u_Doctor_Nick149,0,1.0,False

Coffee, tea, wine, and even certain foods can leave your teeth looking yellow or discolored over time. The good news? You don't need expensive dental visits to get a brighter smile.

**What Causes Teeth Stains?**

Before jumping into solutions, it helps to understand what you're dealing with. Surface stains happen when dark-colored drinks and foods stick to your enamel. Smoking and tobacco products make things worse. Even getting older naturally causes teeth to lose some of their brightness.

**What Makes a Good Teeth Whitening Kit?**

The best teeth whitening kits share a few important features. They use safe whitening agents like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. They come with comfortable trays or strips that actually stay in place. And most importantly, they show real results without causing major sensitivity issues.

**Key Things to Look For**

When shopping for a whitening kit, check the concentration of the whitening gel. Higher percentages work faster but might cause more sensitivity. LED lights can speed up the process, though they're not always necessary. You also want something that's easy to use at home without complicated instructions.

**Getting Results on Stained Teeth**

For noticeable whitening, consistency matters more than anything else. Most kits need daily use for one to two weeks. People with deeper stains might need a bit longer. The good news is that at-home whitening kits have gotten much better in recent years, and they work on different types of discoloration.

If you're ready to tackle those stains, you can [check out effective teeth whitening options here](https://athomewave.com/teeth-whitening-kit). Look for kits with good reviews that specifically mention stain removal.

**Tips for Better Results**

Brush and floss before using any whitening product. This removes buildup and lets the whitening gel make direct contact with your teeth. Avoid staining foods and drinks during your whitening period if possible. And if you experience sensitivity, take a day or two off between treatments.

**How Long Do Results Last?**

Once you've whitened your teeth, the results typically last several months. Touch-up treatments every few months help maintain your brighter smile. Good dental hygiene and cutting back on staining beverages obviously help too.

The bottom line? Modern at-home whitening kits can genuinely help with stained teeth when used correctly. They're convenient, affordable compared to professional treatments, and you can do everything from your couch.

If a server needs one they bring a shot over and we make it, if we bartenders need it we’ll brew it ourselves of course, except for especially busy nights we’ll store espresso at the beginning of the shift.

I usually shake for 60 shakes or roughly 45 sec-1 min. The foam is almost always better when fresh and shaken to hell. The bubbles are smaller and when it settles it almost looks like a Guinness, or that I’ve added Bailey’s when I didn’t. Something about making them this way is so satisfying to me and I never mind making a million of them, probably because I find comfort in counting the shakes or because as I’m shaking I can take orders and pour other drinks at the same time.

I haven’t used cold brew or other kinds of coffee to make them and I know some restaurants and bars do, which changes the consistency of the foam and the amount of time needed to shake it. 

Personally, I love mine with Ketel One, fresh espresso, and any good quality espresso or coffee liqueur.

As soon as I saw her I was so sure she was queer just based on her vibe and outfit and interests, like she is the most sapphic straight girl I've ever met. As we worked together we slowly started talking and she's so breathtakingly gorgeous so I obviously fell for her. We started going out for coffee after our volunteering shifts. - Also side note, the first time we got coffee together, which was also when I realized I had feelings for her, when we walked into the coffee shop ""We Fell in Love in October"" by girl in red was playing AND it was October and my hopeless romantic ass absolutely died. - Anyways eventually I found out she was straight, which was a shock to me, and we're still friends obviously but now my feelings aren't going away. Also like a part of me is still convinced she's bi because she constantly tells me stories about her past experience with guys and she never seemed that invested in those relationships and we constantly make hating men jokes, but that might just be a girl thing in general. 

It's just killing me because whenever we work together we constantly brush hands or stand close enough that our shoulders touch and it only makes these feelings worse. Im also constantly paranoid about being creepy so every time we brush hands I feel so guilty and convince myself im doing it on purpose cause I like her. 

We've only known each other for a couple weeks and she just started sending me instagram reels after our last hangout and I know we are becoming closer friends but I just wish I could make these feelings go away cause being near her is absolutely killing me.

Usually you can tell who’s big with the general public by what song is playing in malls, coffee shop, convenience stores. I heard tons of Gen 4/5 groups (you know: the coachella girls, the two-color girs, V’s alleged ex solo song, HYBE’s Gen 4 boy groups, the band group, etc.), but BTS? not really.

September was RM’s birthday (I think?), and the only reason I knew was because I walked past HYBE and saw a few fan posters around the building. But that’s it: a handful of posters and a photo booth right in front of HYBE. Meanwhile in April, during other idols’ birthdays (from HYBE and SM), I saw fan projects all over Seoul. You literally couldn’t escape their faces even if you tried.

June was BTS month correct me if i'm wrong. You’d expect celebration for a group whose fans insist they’re “the nation’s pride,” but I didn’t see any trends or event photos on my social (except for the sticker on HYBE building). Meanwhile, two other gen 3 groups I know have their 10th anniversaries this year and both had massive fan events that even showed up on my feed.

This issue isn't unique to my phone; it also appears when I access Google Maps through a web browser on my PC.

Chronology of Events: Initially, a Google Maps pop-up message appeared advising me to change my ""Profile Alias"" name. I accepted and changed it.

* Glitches: Immediately after the change, the system attempted to resync my previous reviews.
* Current Status: All my contributions are stuck at ""Pending Upload"".
* Visual Bugs: In the mobile app, images appear blank/black screen. In the web/desktop versions, reviews/photos also fail to load or appear corrupted.
* Duration: This has been going on for over a month.

Troubleshooting Steps Performed (All Failed):

* Checked on PC (Web Browser): The issue persists on the desktop version, confirming that this is a server-side account error, not a device cache issue.
* Then I tried reverting my Alias ​​to my real name.
* I tried deleting corrupted reviews (Delete function failed/unresponsive).
* Cleared App Cache/Data.

Conclusion: My account is stuck in a server-side sync loop. Since this issue also occurs on the Web Version, I cannot fix it on my end.

I urgently need an account refresh/sync fix.

Thank you.

He had revealed this at an extended family gathering of which I was not in attendance. We don't have the closest relationship, but we don't hate each other or anything. A few weeks ago, my brother had said something about drinking coffee and today, when I told him I brewed my own beer, he asked if he could try it. I honestly thought he was joking and I didn't entertain this response. It almost kinda seemed like he was mocking me or something (I assumed he was still actively attending). A bit later I asked my sister what that was about and she goes ""oh you didn't know? He and [his wife] left the church a couple years ago..."" my mind is overwhelmed with this because I've always been the black sheep jack Mormon of our ""perfect"" Mormon family, same thing too, when my sister revealed to us she was no longer attending. 

Anyway, that's the back story, so the advice I need is I want to say something to my brother about not telling me he had made this decision and instead just dropping hints here and there, confusing me. But I don't know how I can say something without sounding like a jerk or making him feel bad.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p57w5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSanDiego/comments/1p57w5u/relic_bakery/,Relic Bakery,"We used to frequent the ghost kitchen on Miramar Road that birthed Relic Bageri and always found their pastries to be wonderful. We live in North County, so we find it hard to get downtown, hence we hadn't visited their new brick and mortar restaurant, now apparently called Relic _Bakery_. It was such a beautiful morning, we decided to take a road trip.

Their spot in East Village is easy to find and has plenty of enough street parking. It is a great space, with inside and outside seating and a wonderful coffee bar. The same great pastries are in abundance, including what might be my favorite scone in the world: Their lemon and blueberry version. It has that great scone texture without being dry as the Sahara. Coffee is excellent and they get points for not having an upcharge for alternative milk choices.

Best of all is the inviting inside and outside spaces. Plenty of seating, with fire rings outside for warmth. Inside are comfortable booths and sturdy tables. It's several notches above any coffee shop and you can actually pause to relax and enjoy a pastry - feel free to grab another out of the inevitable to-go box you thought you'd bring home. We ate all of our to-go stuff and had to go back for refills. They also have different breakfast and lunch menus with a few heartier items.

It's a great sign to see the two owners there on a Sunday morning working in the kitchen. While you order at the counter and seat yourself, food is brought to your table and the staff was readily available to assist with anything you needed. We will definitely be back. It's a real treat compared to the elbow-to-elbow wooden benches outside Wayfarer.

I’ve been talking to a woman at my gym since August. She’s very *reserved*—not flirty, not the type who hugs everyone, doesn’t make strong eye contact with random guys, etc. But with me, she’s opened up a LOT, way more than I expected for knowing her only a few months.

Here’s where it gets confusing:

**She told me she’s “separated,” sleeps in a different room, and doesn’t talk to her husband at home at all.**
But at the same time, they still go out to concerts, bars, etc. She says it’s “awkward,” but they still go. She’s also been telling me for months that she’s “moving out,” but when the date gets close, she always has a new excuse.

She also repeatedly tells me:

* they aren’t intimate
* they don’t communicate
* they’re basically roommates for the sake of their kid

But then she talks about him sometimes in normal or positive ways. So I don’t fully buy the “we don’t talk at all” thing.

**My theory:** she’s trying to make herself appear more single/available to me, or keep the emotional connection safe, so I don’t feel guilty talking to her.

---

### **Her behavior toward me:**

This is what’s throwing me off:

• She hugs me regularly (but she’s not a hugger with most people)
• She’s comfortable doing long workouts with me
• She shows me IG profiles, asks if she should follow people back
• She asked my type of girl
• She asked if I hooked up with anyone when I was traveling
• She got jealous-ish when I talked about another girl
• She hits me up for gym sessions first sometimes
• She recently agreed to coffee and lunch outside the gym
• She posted an IG note right after we hung out saying “Made my day ☺️”

And she shows this behavior ONLY with me. She’s not like this with other guys—except one time with a “gym crush,” which she seemed embarrassed/awkward about when I was around.

---

### **What I’m trying to figure out:**

Is her body language and behavior signaling that she wants me to **make a physical move** (light romantic move, first step, etc.)?

Or…

Is she just trying to **keep the emotional attention**, make herself feel “single” around me, and maintain the emotional affair?

I’m not interested in being in a real relationship with her.
I genuinely enjoy the attention, validation, and the gym vibe.
I’m not trying to break up a marriage — I’m just trying to understand what her signals actually mean in terms of *body language* and *intent.*

Because the more she tells me they “don’t talk at home,” the more I notice the inconsistencies. And I can’t tell if those inconsistencies are her:

* trying to seem available,
* trying to keep me interested,
* or actually wanting me to make a physical move.

What does her body language suggest? Anyone seen something like this before?",4,1763958414.0,bodylanguage,16,0.75,False

best time to go is during low time at around 2-5pm. Not recommended for work/book reading if daghan na tao since it gets crowded and banha. They have wifi pero dili ka maka connect. Dugay ni sila mag close.

12D Cafe: 
homey! its a small cafe and it’s conducive for work/study since it gets to get filled up by people with laptops/books. Good place and good price. 

Columns Coffee:
best place for catch up with friends. It’s aesthetically pleasing ilang interior pod. If you wanna read, it’s a best place pod pero if mo dghan gyud tao and dili ka maka focus, pag Netflix nalang.

Dear Joe:
holiday vibes. Better compared to coffee project, with wifi pod. High price range.

Craft coffee:
Opens early! naay wifi and you can work there too! lots of food options and good place pod.

Second shot:
go-to cafe for work and leisure and naay WiFi. Lami ilang coffee and it’s expected na daghan mo adto. It gets too banha especially if naay mga kaila ang owner/baristas na naga visit after workout. 

Heron cafe: 
expensive compared to second shot and they’re just few walks away. But it’s a place where u can work kay naa sila tables naka linya gyud.

Project brew:
catch-up place. The set-up sa table/chair is not for working long hours. But they have food pop-ups outside and friendly kaayo.

Fulcrum at Watergate:
If need ka mag work late and you happen to visit project brew, tabok nalang. Mas gamay naga tambay diria na mga ante na mag sge katawa. Dugay pod mag close.

Leah’s Cafe:
opens at 7am, with meals and coffee. And it’s for working individuals gyud. All of the tables has outlets and dili sya crowded dili pod banha. Walay mga students or mga tigulang na grupo naga tambay. With wifi. Wfh people seem to be working there often. 

Sas cafe:
best place to laundry and work. Has good food options and no people loitering/lounging. Dili banha, with wifi pod. A lot of law students study there. 

Paramount:
Catch up place. If you wanna work, naay tables atubangan sa highway na tends to be banha and dali mapuno.

For locations, check their FB pages or google maps.


**** i think daghan pa wala na add here.

1p57mpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1p57mpb/drift_vs_freeze_in_gpt51_explained_with_coffee/,Drift vs Freeze in GPT-5.1 — explained with coffee and milk,"Yesterday’s experiment showed something simple:  
send the same message 10 times and watch how it changes.

Some models “drift.”  
GPT-5.1 often “freezes.”

Here’s an easy way to see the difference — no technical terms.

---

Drift = adding milk one spoon at a time

Imagine a cup of black coffee.  
Add one spoon of milk after each turn:

• dark  
• slightly lighter  
• lighter  
• eventually a whole different drink  

That’s drift:

• Run1 → perfect  
• Run5 → slightly off  
• Run10 → “who is this?”  

A slow color shift.

---

Freeze (GPT-5.1) = dumping the whole carton in

Instead of one spoon, pour the *entire* milk carton at once.

• it becomes one uniform color  
• everything **blends** instantly  
• and it stays that way  
• you can’t un-blend it  

That’s freeze mode:

• one wrong interpretation  
• everything **blends** into that  
• the model locks onto it  
• answers repeat the same pattern  

Freeze = “incorrect idea → permanent **blend**.”

---

Yesterday’s experiment made this visible

● “3 lines in one block”  
= dumping everything into the cup

→ instructions blend  
→ GPT-5.1 freezes that mixture  
→ reply style becomes locked  
→ every answer looks the same  

---

● “A / B / C split”  
= adding ingredients separately

→ nothing blends  
→ instructions stay clear  
→ replies stay consistent  

---

#
In short:
• Mixed instructions → drift (slow change) or freeze (locked change)  
• Separated instructions → stable behavior  

Different outcomes, same root cause:  
**everything blends when all instructions live in one block.**

Hey ladies 👋

I’m a single dad to two awesome kids, and I’m finally ready to find my person. I’m looking for a godly woman I can love fiercely, cherish deeply, and build a lifetime of new memories with. Someone who wants real commitment, not games.

About me: •	Total dork at heart ❤️ I live for Disney trips, Universal days, arcade nights, and beating everyone at air hockey •	Goofy, affectionate, and will 100% make you laugh until you can’t breathe •	Love cozy coffee dates, deep conversations, and spontaneous adventures •	Big on faith, family, and showing up fully for the people I love Looking for: •	A woman who loves Jesus and wants to grow together in faith •	Someone who’s kind, fun, and doesn’t mind a man who’s all-in and a little silly •	Bonus if you like theme parks, Marvel movies, or can destroy me at Mario Kart 😏

I’m in the Inland Empire (Riverside/San Bernardino area). If you’re seriously looking for something real and think we might click, shoot me a DM! I’ve got Discord or Instagram too if that’s easier to chat on. No hookups, no endless chatting looking for my future wife to do life with

Hope to hear from you 🥰",1,1763958166.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I am a 29 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I would not like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.  I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. However I am also open to long distance. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon! Also you must like mushrooms, beets, and molasses. All 3 of them not just 2. Also I want to have children this is a requirement. Also please make an effort when messaging me. By effort I I mean at least 1 sentence, not 1 word. Physical attraction is much more important to me than personality. Also I am currently living in a group home for now due to being disabled. If you can’t handle those things don’t message me. Also please don’t expect me to work from home. I much prefer working at a workplace rather than staying at home all day.
